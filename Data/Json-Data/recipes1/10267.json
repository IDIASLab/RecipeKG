I found an orange cake mix at my store, but chose the white cake mix instead, because the orange stripes that the jello makes are pretty when served (you wouldn't see them if the cake were orange).  I added 1 tsp. orange extract to the batter for orange flavor (would definitely do again!).  I like the taste of Dream Whip better than the frozen whipped topping, so I whipped up the pudding mix, same amount of milk, and 1 envelope of Dream Whip.  I used 3/4 tsp. vanilla, and 1/4 tsp. orange extract (thought the original amounts might be too overpowering).  The results were fantastic!  I used a nice garnish - sliced a small orange thin, then cut each slice halfway, twisted, and placed them on top.  Pretty!  Will definitely make this cake again.  Thanks for the recipe!",

To the batter I added 1 tsp of orange extract for flavoring and also to try to mask that artificial \"cake mix\" taste that cake box mixes tend to leave as an aftertaste in my mouth. I made 20 cupcakes altogether. It took 23 minutes to bake. I poked holes into the cupcakes while it was still hot using toothpicks, then drizzled the orange gelatin over. I let it cool completely, 1 hour. To the pudding mix I added 1 tsp orange extract, omitting the vanilla extract, plus I added some orange zest. I folded in half of the cool whipped topping and spread around the cupcakes. It was just the right amount of frosting for each cupcake.  I placed the cupcakes into the refrigerator to chill. The results were fantastic! A light, refreshing delicious ORANGE-Y cupcake. Yum! These tasted just like orange dreamsicles I remember as a little girl. The cake itself is moist and the whipped pudding on top of the cupcake is light and creamy orange-y. I can see the specks of orange zest throughout the frosting and I really liked the stripe design on the inside of the cupcakes. Although I don't know if anyone else noticed the strips in the cupcakes as they were gobbled up so fast! All I was told is that it tasted good-like orange shebert. This recipe is easy to follow and leaves room to try a variety of other flavors in place of orange. A keeper for use again!",

Mix in two cups sifted confectioners sugar. Mix in 2 Tablespoons vanilla extract and 1 Tablespoon orange extract. This icing is much thinner than the cool whip topping but tastes the same.",
