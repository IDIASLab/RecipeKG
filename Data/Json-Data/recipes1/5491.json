I also only served this COLD with wavy thick potato chips. I just put a tsp. of lemon juice and a little hot sauce or 1 tsp. of Old Bay. I usually stirred in a cup of frozen salad shrimp. Now I am craving this also.  It is so easy to make but most of us don't have the cream of shrimp soup in our cupboards so when you find it, buy several. UPDATE: I always rinse the shrimp whether it is frozen or canned. You should not taste a fishy taste then.",

I don't like mine too fishy and I'm cheap:) so a lot of times I leave out the extra shrimp. I also sub dry onion flakes for the green onion. This is great as a veggie dip.",

But then after originally rating this recipe. I edited this review. I did follow this to a T but when I made the batch I divided it into 2 tupperware containers and used half to take a photo with with the topped green onions. Now then I thought scrap it back into a bowl and the girls can have it the next day. Well I needed a late night snack went and grabbed the baked ruffles and the bowl with the green onions in them from before..hmm don't \"just\" top the dip with onions...stir them bad boys into it. That's what helps the flavor. I had to go back and chop up 2 more green onions and add to the rest. The hint of onion in this recipe..makes the flavor. No kicks or fruells just a nice all around flavor. That's a way to go. And I'd also suggest make it ahead so that the shrimp and onion blend well together. I didn't reheat the dip after refigerated. Taste pretty nice just as is on the cold side. So I will make again.",
