I didn't have the shortening and salted nuts so I used butter and chunky natural peanut butter. These cookies were rather flat but they were so yummy that I didn't care. I used salted butter (and the exact amount of salt called for) so the cookies weren't incredibly sweet. But that's good! Update: I subbed semisweet chocolate chips for the chopped nuts upon making this recipe again. Amazing!",
