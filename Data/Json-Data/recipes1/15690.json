I did put them under the broiler for a couple minutes, but was concerned that more than that would overcook the chicken.  Just thinking next time that I make these I might try increasing the temperature from 375\u00baF to 400\u00baF or even 425\u00baF, reducing the cooking time and, perhaps, getting a better crisp on them.  They did taste good with a bit of heat kicking in on the back end, so be prepared for that.  I didn\u2019t have any blue cheese on hand to make dressing, so I used Ranch, but trust me, you want blue cheese!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
