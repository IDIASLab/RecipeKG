I poured out all the fat from the skillet after cooking the chops and rinsed it then sprayed on some no-stick spray to keep the potatoes from sticking. I also added about 1/4 cup of chicken broth because I was worried there wasn't enough liquid and the potatoes would burn and then after the potatoes were done took everything out but the liquid and added a bit of cornstarch because it was really runny. I also recommend adding dried thyme salt and pepper. Frozen green beans would be good too. This was great with honey corn muffins and a salad! Yummy!",
