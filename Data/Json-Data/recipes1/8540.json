Hint**If you can not find any key lime juice then just use equal parts lemon and lime juice (best if fresh). These adjustments will make more filling than needed, but the texture and taste is better.  I had to increase my baking time by 15 minutes.  I prebaked my redi-crust and this came out great.

I first made it in August for my mother-in-law's visit & wasn't sure how the recipe was going to turn out.  But it came out wonderfully & my mother-in-law could not stop raving about it!  I had to print her a copy of this recipe before she left for the airport, & I have also emailed it to my sister-in-law upon her mom's request that she try this recipe.  It has the perfect amount of richness & tartness for us (a small sliver goes a long way).  The whipped cream topping was a beautiful touch!  I used a Keebler reduced fat graham cracker crust & altered the recipe according to another reviewer's suggestions.  I used 4 egg yolks, 2 (14 oz) cans of sweetened condensed milk, & 1 cup of bottled key lime juice.  i had to bake for 20-25 minutes instead of just 15 minutes.  We found out that it also tastes best when refrigerated for at least several hours.  Hope you enjoy this pie as much as my family & I did!",

First, I thought this pie deserved a homemade graham cracker crust, which I baked first, then cooled. Thinking this would be a little too eggy with 5 yolks, I used only four--perfect. I also knew the custard could stand a little more tartness, so I added 1-1/2 tsp. of grated lime zest to the filling. Perfect.  I baked it at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, then when cooled, topped the pie with 1 cup of sweetened whipped cream. Light and refreshing citrus-y pie, and the perfect complement to a spicy Mexican meal.",

I use the following: 3/4 c. key lime juice (Nelly & Joe's brand), 2 cans sweetened condensed milk, and 4 egg yolks.  It comes out perfect EVERY time, and people constantly ask for the recipe.  Trust me... these measurements are the way to go.  I've made it this way probably 20 times at least!!!  You can also easily cut back on fat and calories by using lowfat sweetened condensed milk -- you will never know the difference.",

Take a tbsp of the condensed milk and mix it into the eggs. When combined add another couple spoonfulls to the eggs. Now that your egg mix is no longer bright yellow add it to the big bowl of milk and lime juice...This is what people mean by tempering. If you just dump it all into a bowl together...you get really creamy filling with scrambled egg bits. Lime and egg DO NOT MIX ALONE. The citric acid will \"cook\" the eggs. Other than that this is a really good recipe:)",

I also increased the amount of lime juice to about 2/3s of a cup - these proportions gave it the perfect amount of sweet-tart flavor for my tastes. I also added the zest of 3 key limes for extra flavor, and 2 small drops of green food coloring for a very light lime color. While I usually prefer whipped cream, I topped it with whipped topping, because that is what my boyfriend's family prefers, (I had cooked dinner for them.) and I think it works better with the rich filling than heavy cream would. Light cream would probably be just as good. Everyone loved this pie... its easy, quick, and delicious. What more could you want?",

The pie was extremely dense like a very dense cheesecake. All of the KLP we have had in Florida (including very recently) has been smooth creamy and sometimes even very light as if whipped cream had been added. We've had some of the best in Florida. This was a huge disappointment.",
