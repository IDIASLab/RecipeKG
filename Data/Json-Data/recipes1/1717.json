I made the cake exactly as written and baked in mini fluted tube pan.  The cake didn't brown much on top, but the texture was good.  I missed salt and would add that next time.  I followed others advice and reduced sugar to 1 cup for frosting.  Came out great.  It was my first time making boiled frosting and I liked the marshmallow fluff-esque texture that also held it's shape when piped.  Thanks for this recipe!  It's a keeper",

I was out of vanilla extract so I used pure almond extract in the cake. This change made the cake taste like a Madeline. I also took the previous reviewers recommendation and reduced the brown sugar to 1 cup packed in the frosting, as I do not like over sweet frosting. I did use vanilla extract in the frosting.  I decorated with toasted almond only as raisins do not go over well with most of my family.  I also shared a bit of the history of the cake.",
