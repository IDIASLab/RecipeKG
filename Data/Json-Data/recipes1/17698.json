Morgans spiced rum and had no pineapple juice since I used pre-sliced fresh pineapple in a plastic container and it had a little sponge on the bottom which stole all the juice. Subbed OJ. Subbed a few dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg for cardamom (personal preference). My skillet was a bit larger than 12 inches so my batter just barely covered the pineapple and cooked up in about 20-25 minutes. Very tasty - very buttery",

The dough was actually very thick almost knead-able even after I added a splash more of milk to try and loosen it up a little. But I gamely spread the dough on the fruit-and-sugar in the skillet and baked it... and it came out DELICIOUS. As a note I used coconut sugar in place of the brown sugar in the topping and a third of a cup of agave instead of the half cup of sugar in the cake itself. Worked just fine.",
