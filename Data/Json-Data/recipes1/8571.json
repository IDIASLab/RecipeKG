I also omitted the chocolate chips and nuts. Finally to decorate I melted and piped vanilla candy melts on top. Also I baked them on a non-stick insulated cookie sheet. The cookies cooked perfectly and browned very very lightly on the bottom. Thanks for sharing! Update: April1 2010. I have been making this cookie for 6 years now and it's my most popular one with everyone I know. I have used different pudding mix flavors and varied the choclate chips and nuts to complement the flavors. Now I make triple the batch everytime I bake them.",
