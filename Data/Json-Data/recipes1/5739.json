I served the hens with potatoes and sugar snapped peas and the dinner was a hit. The only problem I ran into was the cook time for me was a good 30mins. longer than the suggested cook time in the recipe and I only made 2 hens. But even leaving them in longer didn't dry them out and they still came out tender and moist. I would also suggest using a roasting rack instead of just sitting them in the pan because I didn't think the bottom of the chicken was as crisp and flavorful as the top. I think the roasting rack would have prevented that. Overall a good recipe and I'll use it again hopefully with the salsa this time!",
