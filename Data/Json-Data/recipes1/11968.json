We scaled it back to 3 cups and it seemed to allow the almond and coconut flavors to blend in as well. We subsituted 3 cups unlbeached flour 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and used sliced almonds. Once we got the chocolate ratio right these cookies were fabulous! Quick easy and freeze well. A great quick addition to your recipe box.",

Other modifications: I didn't have any baking soda so I used baking powder (1 tsp soda = 2 tsp powder) and omitted the salt. I substituted half the vanilla with almond extract added 1/4 cup extra coconut (because I wanted to finish my jar of it) and added about 1/2 cup less of chocolate chips than called for. These really do taste like almond joy (at least with the almond extract and extra coconut in there) and are a really nice texture. Will definitely make this one again!",
