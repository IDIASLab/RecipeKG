I cut down on the number of corn tortillas to about 10/12 and I put a VERY thin layer of the sauce under the tortillas to keep them moist.  I only used the Cream of Mushroom Soup and left out the Cream of Chicken.  I used light sour cream.  I added a can of Ro-tel (spelling?) tomatoes with chilis, I used more cheese (1/2 of which was Pepper Jack and 1/2 Chedder) and I added a small can of HOT chilis to the mix.  I also increased the turkey to about 2 cups.  I layered sauce, tortillas, turkey cheese, sauce tortillas, turkey and cheese.  WE LOVED THIS!!  Great EASY meal and what a great way to use up leftover turkey!",

I switch the corn for flour tortillas, and I chop them up into inch squares - it makes it easier to serve and eat.  I also add about half of a medium onion chopped, and I am very generous with the cheese - I use a lot more than is called for.  Also this recipe freezes very well - I usually make two 8x8\" pans at once; we eat one and freeze one for later.  When we are ready for this meal again, I simply pull out the frozen dish at noon and cook it in the evening for dinner.  OUR FAVORITE!",

I omitted the cream of mushroom soup and added one can of tomatoes with green chilies.  Also added 1 tsp ground cumin and 1 tsp fajita seasoning and stirred the turkey, soup, chilies, tomatoes, sour cream, 1/3 cup chopped cilantro and spices together and let sit for about an hour in the refrigerator before assembling the casserole.  I then layered it as directed.  After baking I sprinkled with sliced green onions.  I served this with salsa on the side as it wasn't spicy enough for my husband.  We both liked it a lot after the changes.  It's a really good and different way to use the leftover turkey.",

I'm typically not a fan of Cream of Mushroom casseroles. Mostly because they're lazy and unimaginative for the most part (and loaded full of sodium). However given that this one is for turkey leftovers simple is what you want. After all you just got done cooking a Thanksgiving feast. Things I might try next time: ground cumin hotter peppers chopped onion and/or marinading the turkey before hand. Notes: You \"leftover Thanksgiving turkey\" will affect the taste of this recipe. If you fry smoke or roast your turkey it will result in three flavor variations on this recipe. The same is true if you baste and rub your turkeys with herbs those flavors will carry over to this casserole (and not all of those flavors are Southwestern friendly). So the further away from simple roast turkey your turkey is the more \"off\" this recipe will taste. Three Stars: It is after all a Cream of Mushroom based casserole.",
