I used a 3qt pan for the sugar/heavy cream mixture. I considered a 3qt pan a \"large\" sauce pan. Not so. When making this, keep in mind that when you add the baking soda, the mixture is going to \"bubble up\". It's going to bubble up A LOT!!! This bubbled up and OVER the top of my pan and all over the top of my new stove and ran down into the burners. I spent the 20 minute cooling period cleaning up the mess. Once I got it all under control, the candy was good. I would use a pan closer to a dutch oven sized pan next time. Yes, I will make it again, but I'll be a little wiser about it. :)",

Stovetop candy recipes are so much about feel and experience that they can be hard to write down! This only partially set up for us and the texture was a little grainy. I think we needed to let the sugar melt more (it does take a long long time so be prepared) and I also think we should have made sure the cream was at least at a simmer before we added the caramel (which promptly congealed into a big gooey lump instead of combining). I would also advise waiting for 30 minutes before you start beating; ours was still pretty liquid at 20. There's another recipe on this site called Aunt Bill's Brown Candy that I think I'll use next time - same basic ingredients but more specific directions about some of the procedures involved. Thanks anyway though!",
