I will change just two things next time though: 1) Instead of forming cookies I will line an 8x8\" baking dish with wax paper and pour the batter in then put it in my fridge to set. These cookies tasted exactly like fudge so why not make them look like fudge? I think it would make life a little easier to do it that way. 2) I will not crumble the graham crackers to dust. I think leaving bigger pieces in there would be delicious as they absorb so much liquid and soften. Not leaving bigger pieces was MY fault though. The owner of the recipe said to crush them until they are small pieces not turn them into dust.:) All in all I am extremely happy with this dessert and ever grateful to the creator. Great job!",
