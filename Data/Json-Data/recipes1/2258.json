Guests DEVOURED 'em. My parents and I aren't big fans of icing so we had the cake by itself and it was still delicious! I used frosting for my sister's baby shower and placed sliced strawberries on top of each cupcake. I actually prefer the no frosting... lol. I made a couple changes -- I use french vanilla cake mix I only use half of the required gelatin (so 1.5 ounce) replace the oil with unsweetened apple sauce use 2 eggs and 2 egg whites 1 1/2 cups finely diced fresh strawberries and substitute the buttermilk if I have to.
