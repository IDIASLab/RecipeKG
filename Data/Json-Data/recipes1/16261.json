These chipotle chiles are jalapeno peppers that have been dried, smoked, and then packed in a flavorful sauce made of tomatoes and other spices. Here, we add these special peppers twice--first to the mayonnaise, which gets spread on the buns, and then mixed into the meat before its grilled. And don't skip the red onions and tomatoes: they add a sweet, crisp bite.",

                "reviewBody": "These burgers were great. Flavorful and not dry at all! But the way we had them was slightly different from this recipe. I had my brother cook them because I had a headache. He's autistic and not that great of a cook... but I figured this recipe would be simple enough for him to make. He didn't measure his ingredients... I believe he used about a half cup of mayo and he used the entire can of peppers and sauce.. which I figure was about 4 peppers and about a half cup of sauce. Instead of making the chipotle mayo as the directions calls for he mixed everything together (the mayo ground beef garlic peppers sauce etc). He also cooked them in the oven instead of the grill. The burgers still came out great. I was worried that using all the peppers would make the patties too spicy but they turned out to have just a slight nice kick. The only downer was that we used cheap ground beef (73/27) so the pan was full of grease when they were done. Next time I will use leaner beef and cook them on the grill so that the fat can drip off the patties while they cook. 4/19/12 update: I made these burgers again myself a few days ago and they were great. I doubled the recipe used ground turkey instead of beef mixed the mayo w/ the meat added 1 egg used the whole can chipotle and sauce (small can- I think its about 4 oz or so). I added more cilantro... maybe a 1/2 cup & cooked patties in oven. The burgers were great & not dry thanks to the mayo in the meat mixture.",

First you can used fresh grated garlic (grate as finely as possible) or use garlic powder or dried minced garlic which seems to work better and not have as much of a bite as the fresh garlic. Also don't use their special seasoning as it is basically salt and pepper with artificial filler. Add a dash of onion powder if you want but skip the filler and control the amount of salt yourself. ALSO add chipotle chopped and the adobo sauce as needed tasting as you go along. Everyone has a different heat level and this is the only way to ensure you don't make something you can't handle.",
