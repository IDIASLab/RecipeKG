If you are looking for a FLAVORLESS cake then you have found the perfect recipe. I\"m not sure if there are mistakes in the recipe and semi-sweet chocolate should have been used as opposed to unsweetened. Also even though I tripled the amount of orange zest used (I large juicy navel oranges) the orange flavor was faint at best. The glaze gives this cake a special touch but cannot make up for the flavor that is seriously lacking. I agree that the combination of orange and chocolate marry well but in relation to this cake it was not a match made in heaven.",

I did make a few changes to increase the volume as wanted to cook the cake in a 10-inch Bundt pan.Here are the changes: 3 cups of flour 2 cups of sugar 4 eggs and 4 squares of chocolate instead of 2. These adjustments were enough to create a nice big fluffy cake in a 10-inch Bundt pan. Definitely a keeper!!!",

Works beautifully and cooks in about 25 minutes. The first time I made it I topped one half with the topping suggested in the recipe and left the other half plain for the kids. Have to say that I wasn't desperately fussed about the recipe topping - too sweet for me - much preferred it as a plain sponge as it has so much flavour on its own. The second time I made it I put the orange liqueur in the cake mix itself (and added more orange zest). Once it was cooked and cooled I sandwiched the two halves together with a whipped-cream/cocoa/orange extract/icing sugar cake filling; then sprinkled icing sugar and orange zest on the top. Got rave reviews! Since my husband doesn't like chocolate I'm going to try it next time using a coffee and almond/amaretto combination. A year later and it's our staple base cake mix - I've made it lots of times as a coffee cake mocha cake chocolate cake and got rave reviews for a lemon version with a lemon-creamcheese frosting found elsewhere on this site.",
