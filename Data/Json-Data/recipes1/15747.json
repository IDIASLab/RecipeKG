I added extra cornstarch to get the gravy good and thick so it wouldn't run everywhere when cut into. This is hearty, filling, and very cozy. You can certainly play with the filling ingredients and add extra seasonings, but it's a great basic pot pie recipe, and the mushrooms are the star in this one for sure!",
