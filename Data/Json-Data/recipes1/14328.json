And if using premade crusts, this recipe is enough to make 2 cheesecakes! The first time I made this my cake burned because I baked it for the rec. 55 minutes = ( . Now I know it says to cookit that long because the original size of the cake is alot thicker than if you use a premade crust; hence what  I said about this making 2 cakes. ",

For me, the lemon did not over power the recipe, but I did forget to have my sour cream room temp, so it didn't brown at all, and it cracked later in the fridge.\n\nI have two tips to avoid cracking in cheesecakes. One is to not over beat your cream cheese. The other is to bake your cheesecake until almost all the jiggle in the middle is gone, then turn off your oven and leave it in there with the door slightly open. The gradual cool down helps to prevent cracking verses immediately putting it into the fridge.",

It looked (and tasted) like cheesecake i bought at hotels only this time the cost is a fift :).",
