My mother and aunt (both born and raised in Poland) have never eaten jalape\u00f1os and don't really do spicy (unlike me) so I did as another reviewer suggested and boiled them for a few minutes prior to stuffing. This definitely took away some of the kick and because of that they managed to polish off half of them by themselves! Love this recipe though next time I might skip boiling so I can enjoy the intensity of the pepper.",
