However I had to make some changes. I had to use a yellow pepper instead of a red one and that with the corn made it look like a yellow mess on lettuce. I would definitely go for the red next time. Also dicovered too late that I had no honey added a bit of sugar trying to fix it but I'm sure it wasn't the same. And finally the recipe doesn't say so but it would be nice to chill it for a bit before serving. I'll make this again and try to follow the recipe more closely.",

Rather than use prepared/commercial dressings I used a quarter-cup each of olive oil and wine vinegar... and three tablespoons of crumbled bleu cheese. I also used half of the called-for bacon; just didn't think it needed all eight slices. I also eliminated the lettuce altogether and added a diced tomato and a diced cucumber. This will be my lunch at the office next week. Oh... and perhaps because of my cutting back on the bacon and eliminating the bottled dressings I found the final salad benefited by the addition of healthy pinch of Kosher salt.",
