I also refrigerated them over night then rolled them into golf ball size balls then baked them. One friend suggested Crasins would be a nice touch. Over the years when I have made these cookies I have always gotten rave reviews. Several times they were even requested to be made. Thay are good and our boys even ask for them over the other cookies I have made. What makes this recipe unique from others is that you can change it to what you like. I have added peanutbutter chips in and butterscotch chips as well. My mom even added dates to hers before while we were growing up. This recipe has been passed down through our generations so I hope it will become a keepsake for your family as it has become for ours. Enjoy.",

I also upped the oats and cornflakes by about 1/2 cup each. Oh and I used pecans instead of walnuts since I'm allergic to walnuts.
