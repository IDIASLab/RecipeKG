They look impressive, too - someone asked me if I had gone to a bakery to get them.  They do take a VERY long time to make because of having to wait for things to set and chill, so make sure that you make these a day or 2 ahead of when you need them - they are not something you can whip up the morning before a party.  Just a tip - I had some trouble getting the chocolate to melt to a consistency where it would drizzle prettily.  My solution - I heated a pan of water to almost boiling and then turned off the heat.  I put the white and semisweet chocolates in different Ziploc bags and placed them in the water to melt.  Once they were all melted, I cut off one corner of the bag and voila!  Chocolate drizzle!",

I used lime marmalade instead of raspberry jam & grated the zest from a lime over top. Omitted the semi-sweet chocolate & almost upped the white chocolate to compensate but didn't....was glad because it really didn't need any more. I also used chopped toasted hazlenuts instead of walnuts. My son has declared these the best cookies I have EVER made & is begging me to make more. Although I can see how they may be too sweet w/out the tartness of the lime to counteract it. Thansk for the recipe!",
