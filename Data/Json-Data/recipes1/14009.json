I used a very large sweet potato (left skin on for extra nutrients) one peeled regular potato one peeled carrot 1/2 cup frozen green beans 1/2 cup frozen corn and veggie broth. I simmered the potatoes and carrot in the broth then threw everything including the broth into my Vitamix and whirled until the veggies incorporated but left a few chunks. I skipped the sugar and salt but will possibly add a little of one or both based on her reaction when she tastes. Great blend of veggies (I thought it tasted great)!",
