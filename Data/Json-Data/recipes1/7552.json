Used a prior reviewer's suggestion and made it in a round 2-qt casserole dish instead of a 9x13-inch pan, to avoid having a dry casserole (other than that I followed the recipe exactly).  Like previous reviewers have commented, it was just a tad on the dry side.  Wasn't so dry that my fiance and I didn't enjoy eating it (it was really tasty!), but could use about half a can more soup.  I used red onions which made for a colorful dish.  I will definitely be making this again - it's a keeper - but next time I'm going to add 1/2 can more soup to it.",

Where did the cayenne pepper substitute come from, I didn't see it in the receipe, although it would be a good addition. Thanks for the recipe.",

As other reviewers stated, I too added some milk to make it more creamy.  I then added about a 1/4 cup of miracle whip as well for a little zip, then I did my usual doctoring with onion and garlic powders.  Instead of using potatoe chips on top I used crushed crackers that I pulsed a few times in the food processor with some melted garlic butter.  The end reult was a very yummy tuna casserole.",

AFTER READING THE REVIEWS ABOUT THE CASSEROLE BEING DRY AND BLAND, I MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. I USED A FAMILY SIZE CAN CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP, I PUT A LITTLE EXTRA SALT IN THE BOILING WATER THAT I COOKED THE NOODLES. I MELTED 1.5 STICKS OF BUTTER IN A SAUCEPAN AND SAUTED MY ONIONS BECAUSE I DID NOT THINK 20 MINUTES WOULD GET THEM AS TENDER AS I PREFER. OF COURSE, I ADDED THAT BUTTER TO THE MAKING OF THE CASSEROLE AS WELL. I INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF ONION CALLED FOR IN THE RECIPE TO HALF OF A LARGE ONION. I USED SHARP CHEDDAR CHEESE AS WELL FOR ADDED FLAVOR. I INCORPORATED ALL THE CHEESE INTO THE CASSEROLE AND JUST USED CRUSHED POTATO CHIPS ON TOP. I DID NOT DRAIN THE TUNA, I USED THE JUICE AS WELL TO HELP WITH THE BLAND TASTE THAT WAS MENTIONED IN SEVERAL REVIEWS. I REDUCED THE OVEN TEMP TO 350 DEGREES AS WELL TO KEEP THE CASSEROLE FROM DRYING OUT AS MUCH. THE RESULT WAS EXCELENT!!!",

Instead of cooking the noodles to al dente I cooked them until they were tender. I used three cans of cream of mushroom soup as well which really helped a lot. I also added in half of a normal sized block of cream cheese. That REALLY kicked the flavor up a lot and took it to a whole other level. I also cooked the onion so that it was tender instead of crunchy. Now what I did was I mixed the cream mixture up and heated it before mixing it in with the noodles. I reduced the cooking temp to 350 instead of 425. The result is that the casserole came out delicious and creamy.",

I guess that about sums it up : )  This is what i changed, I seasoned the mixture with johnnys, I did NOT add mushrooms, I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery, i sauteed the onions in a little bit of butter and also some celery, I added some canned corn in addition to the peas and more cheese to the mixture than it calls for.
