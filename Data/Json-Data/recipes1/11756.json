It turned out amazing and very filling. I could see the original recipe being a bit light for a main course but if you add the veggies you want it's very filling and even more healthy!",

The components dont mismatch or take away from each other but they do not bring anything exiting out of eachother either. A bit of salt a pinch of sugar for the tomatoes and a dash of balsamic on top of it all made this somewhat serviceable as a mid week meal for myself and the wife but Ill never make it again.",
