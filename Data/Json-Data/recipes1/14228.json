I had two people from India helping me make it and they suggested these changes: more curry (they added about 8 tbls), fresh ground pepper, and use Indian Chili powder not cayenne and increase the amount to about 3 tsp. They said that cayenne is a western spice and Indian chili powder is more authentic. This made it VERY hot. We used the sauce to help spice up another mild curry dish we had.",

Absolutely wonderful. \r\n\r\nHaving experimented with the recipe since that first experience, I suggest trying out a different first step. \r\n\r\nIn a dry pot pre-heated to a medium heat, first roast the curry powder for a minute or until browned, stirring constantly. Add the paprika and the cinnamon, and ginger stirring constantly. (I do not add the sugar) Then add the garlic, bay leaf, and onions, and drizzle the olive oil over top. You can do this with about 1 1/2- 2tbsp. of olive oil. Continue as per the recipe. \r\n\r\nI found that that extra first step enriches the flavor of the curry powder and makes for a fuller-bodied/ slightly spicier curry. \r\n\r\nAmazing recipe and I will definitely use it again and again! - Nadia",

                "reviewBody": "This whole recipe is upside down.  First of all you need to fry the whole spices. Use vegetable oil for Indian cooking, you want the oil to taste of these spices, not olives!. It is the taste of the spices in the oil (whether whole or ground), that seperates high quality fare from stuff in glass jars and plastic packets.  Use 1\" cinnamon stick instead of ground cinnamon, taste is far superior, put this in with the bay leaf (though 2 is probably better) and if you want more taste, 4 or 5 bruised cardomoms and a couple of cloves. All these need to go straight into very hot oil, the spices will pop and splutter and release their flavours into the oil. Should only need a minute or so, but if you have heat too low you will need to use your nose!.  Next add onion, garlic and ginger together, this will stop the garlic and ginger from tasting raw and allow them to release their flavours. Lower the heat, but still keep it medium high.  Once onion etc is done add ground spices, let them touch the bottom of the hot pan (stirring), they will brown somewhat and they won't taste raw, do this for about a minute (again, use your nose!). Do the same for the tomato puree, it browns, taste improves.  I would let the yoghurt integrate and cook a bit before adding the coconut milk. I don't why you would need to remove the bay leaf...  The above..frying spices etc is Indian food 101 and can be used in all recipes and will produce \"that\" taste you are after (spices integrated into the oil!).",
