You may want to try them like this: after making and raising the dough, roll buns a bit larger than golf balls and let them rise for ca 15 mins. Then make a hole in the middle of the buns with your finger. Fill the holes with butter and cover the butter with some white sugar. Put some egg wash on the buns and bake them in the oven (375 degrees) for maybe 10 minutes. The beatiful brown color will tell you when they're done. Enjoy with a glass of cold milk, that's the proper Finnish way to do it!",

I had a hard time choosing between 4 and 5 stars but I settled on 4 because of a few minor issues that I have with the recipe. As a few people commented I think it's better with double the cardamom and I also had to increase the flour quite a bit (although I used all-purpose flour so maybe that's why). But my biggest complaint is that the frosting looks kind of silly to me. Maybe I did something wrong but it seemed to cover up the attractiveness of the bread and lumpy things don't frost very well. Since I just made the bread for my family it didn't really matter but I think I'll have to experiment with the frosting to get it looking better. I'll probably try thinning it out into more of a glaze. UPDATE: I made this again and added more milk to the frosting to thin it out. The bread was much more attractive and was a huge hit with everyone who ate it! This is going into my permanent recipe box.",

We prefer a bit less sweetness and omit the thick glaze. Instead I mix 6 tablespoons of strong coffee with 6 tablespoons of sugar and brush this mixture on the loaves when they come out of the oven. When making these for Christmas I'll sometimes brush with the coffee mixture then sprinkle the loaves with red and green decorators sugar to make them festive.

Instead, after it is braided and has risen and just before baking, brush the loaves with a beaten egg white and sprinkle with Pearl Sugar (available at IKEA) which is a coarse decorator sugar.\nAlso, pre-ground cardamom does not hold a lot of flavor.  Instead, buy whole-seed cardamom and grind it yourself with a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder.  It will be much more flavorful, and 1 teaspoonful will be plenty for this recipe.  1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground cardamom may even suffice.",
