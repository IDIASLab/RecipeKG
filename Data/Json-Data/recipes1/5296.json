I also added the garlic powder some salt and pepper at this point. Cooked til chicken was almost to the point of browning then added potatoes carrots onion 3tblsp. of tomato paste in 1 cup of chicken broth and added some more salt and pepper at this point due to the high volume of potatoes. I cooked on Med. low for maybe 20 minutes stirring occasionally then added 1/2 cup of frozen peas for color and used 1/2 cup of cold water to blend in about 2tblsp. of flour to thicken the stew. I also added a 1/2 tsp. of kitchen bouquet. Served with fresh baguette and it was perfect. Thank you so much for this recipe. This was the first time I have ever had chicken stew!",

I thought it was an aweful lot of potatoes, but they really helped thicken the liquid and make it hearty. I think the turmeric made all the difference. I was really iffy about how it would taste but oh it was wonderful! I will make this all the time. So easy and flavorful and filling.",

This is a pleasant change from traditional stew. Although I did have to add some spice to make it flavorful, along with some fresh garlic and zucchini. There also wasn't an abundance of sauce, so I added some extra water. All and all it's a pretty comforting meal.",

First I browned the chicken with garlic powder and black pepper before I added it to the other ingredients. Second I omitted the carrots (because we are not big fans) and the turmeric (because I couldn't find it in the grocery store). Third I used 1 cup of chicken broth (instead of water) and added 6 Tbsp. of tomato sauce (instead of tomato paste). It turned out a lot better than I expected. Thanks for a good recipe!
