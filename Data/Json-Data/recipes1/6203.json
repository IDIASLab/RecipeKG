I was impatient and didn't allow the potato crust to get crispy and brown so the crust layer in tandem with the cheese tasted a lot like scalloped potatoes. If I ever serve this for breakfast I'll double or triple the amount of egg and milk. Oh and the basil and thyme are absolutely essential to the yumminess factor of this dish. I pulled it out of the oven and was so surprised at how amazing it smelled. The aroma was completely different from anything else I'd ever cooked and I think a large part of it was due to the spices. I'm in love with this stuff and I'll be making it again soon for sure.",

A little extra cheese about 2 cups (colby old and monterey jack) finished this one dish meal off perfectly. Thanks Linda!",
