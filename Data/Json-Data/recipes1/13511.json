Remove and squeeze the juice of a 'Valley Lemon\" on top with fresh ground pepper and a few dahses of \"Frank's Red Hot Original\".  Shoot it down and enjoy.

Use only fresh Oysters from a Seafood Market and have them shuck the oysters for you. This way you avoid the horror stories. Use a shot tube they are nice and thin to place the oysters. Garnish with lemon and a thin slice of celery makes a beautiful shot tube! Your guests will want to try them.",
