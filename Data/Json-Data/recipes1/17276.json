If it is not eaten with in an hour or so it gets slimey. The flavor was excellent. Also a few previous reviewers mentioned that the dressing was to much and I'd like to say that you have to use balsamic vinegar and stone ground mustard. Balsamic vinegar is milder then other vinegars. That may be why others found the dressing to much.",

If you're going to toss it as instructed just use a small amount to start. I drizzled it over the salad and had it on the side for people to add more if they wanted. Fruit balsamic and blue cheese is always big hit with me. Thanks for the recipe!",
