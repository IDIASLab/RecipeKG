It's made with dark corn syrup, peanut butter and whole peanuts and looks like pumpkin pie, but don't be fooled!   This pie is simple and delicious for those who like peanut butter.  It is a great recipe to serve guests as it is an unexpected taste treat! Serve with whipped topping or ice cream if desired.",

For those who said the filling never set- this is a custard pie like pumpkin or pecan bake until the filling is set except for a little jiggle in the middle.

After sitting overnight it would come out in a nice slice without leaking but there was still a huge puddle of filling in the pie dish. It is like a peanut butter version of shoo fly pie - the peanut butter taste is there so you won't be disappointed but people who don't like peanuts might enjoy it too. The only really awkward thing is the solid peanuts...they taste nice and texture etc. but you cannot cut the pie nicely because the nuts get in the way of making even slices and the top (which gets hard as the pie bakes) gets all cracked and uneven when you slice. So...it tastes good and looks bad? I would make it again but not to serve to company.",

After reading some reviews complaining about the pies being runny I changed the ingredients to: 1/2 cup Splenda; 1/2 cup corn syrup - only had light on hand so used it; 1/2 cup extra crunchy peanut butter; 2 eggs; 1 tsp vanilla; and the rest of the peanuts I had on hand. As both the peanut butter and the nuts were salted I omitted the salt. They were cooked to perfection in about 35 minutes (probably because of the smaller crusts). The recipe thus became almost exactly my pecan tart recipe minus the butter and pecans and plus the peanut butter and peanuts! Thanks for sharing this idea.",
