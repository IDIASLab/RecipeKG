I imagine this has such versatility that you could use this for so many things other than as a salad dressing - a rich and luscious serving sauce for chicken or fish comes to mind for starters. I made it easy on myself and used jarred roasted red peppers, but why not? I also altered the proportions of oil and vinegar to the 3:1 oil to vinegar ratio I prefer.  Exceptional and extraordinary.",

Just put the whole pepper in the oven (i.e. after rubbing on the olive oil). I cut the fat in half by reducing the olive oil to 1/4 cup (and thereby reducing the red wine vinegar to 1/8 cup so it wouldn't be overwhelming). I thought 3 cloves of garlic would be too much so I reduced them to 2. I added 1/8 tsp. salt and 1/16 tsp. pepper. I would make all these adjustments again - it turned out wonderfully! Thanks for the recipe!",
