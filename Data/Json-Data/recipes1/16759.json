Went with a half a turkey breast, had it deboned, and marinated it (overnight) in accordance with the instructions.  It was only about 2 lb, so I checked it at 45 minutes, and it was good-to-go.  This turned out very well, juicy and flavorful, and I served it with a Madeira Sauce.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, this one\u2019s a keeper.",
