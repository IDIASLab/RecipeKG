My oranges were on the sour side so I added one red apple just to make sure that the juice wasn't too sour for me to drink and I didn't have any spinach on hand so I added two extra kale leaves (they were huge each leaf made a ball the size of my fist when they were scrunched up to put into the juicer). I probably left out a lot of nutrition by leaving out the spinach but this was a great combination of flavors. I've only had cooked kale so I don't really know what it tastes like raw but for those of you who might be hesitant to use it it doesn't detract from the flavor of the juice at all! Thanks for the great recipe!",
