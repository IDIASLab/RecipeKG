I give this recipe 5 Stars because it is the closest you'll get to an \"Alfredo\" Sauce without all the cream.  My health conscious husband remarked that it looked fattening.  I was so happy to tell him it really wasn't too bad!  Next time I will try cutting the butter in half and see if it makes a big difference in the taste.  I will also add more seafood because all the shrimp went and there's none left in the leftovers.  (Not that much left over anyway!)  Thanks for an excellent recipe!  I can't wait to make it for my Dad!",
