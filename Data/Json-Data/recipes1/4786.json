This has to be one of my favourite chicken recipes I've ever tried. I used half red onion along with white onion as I love the way red onion and balsamic vinegar go together. I also used twice as much wine as the recipe asked for to give it a bit of an extra kick. Like others I sauted the mushrooms breifly over a very high heat to brown them off. I also used chicken breasts as I was only cooking for two people. The recipe creates a really nice thick and rich (yet light) sauce that you can lavish over the chicken mushrooms and onions. I served it with a side of bulgar wheat and briefly stemed vegetables. I think it would also be great with rice or pasta. It's definitely the kind of dish that can be dressed down for a home-evening meal or dressed up for a dinner party. I will be making this over and over! Yummy!",

I added garlic some thyme and did not add any salt. I doubled the wine and added about a quarter cup or so of chicken broth so there would be more liquid. I also sauteed the mushroons before adding. I only had to cook about 15 minutes and removed the chicken. I added the vinegar and sauteed mushroons and let the sauce develop for 5 minutes then added back the chicken and let it pick-up the flavors of the sauce. Will definitely make again. This goes great with Corn and Rice Medley on this site.",

My hubby said the same. I should note that I did did not dredge the chicken in flour in an attempt to keep it the recipe as healthy as possible. After following the reviews and my mom's cooking experience I made the following changes/additions: - 3 cloves garlic added to the onion/celery mix - 2 14 oz cans diced tomatoes in place of the 3 fresh toms. - basil and oregano to taste (fresh is best but dried will do in a pinch) - 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar (the best you can afford) - if using cheaper vinegar (like I did) add 1 tsp sugar to balance the acidity Serve over rice. This has become one of my main meals for 'brown bagging it' dinners (I'm a shift worker). And yes the mushrooms freeze well. Great recipe on it's own (every food preference is subjective) so thanks to Christy for posting this in the first place!",
