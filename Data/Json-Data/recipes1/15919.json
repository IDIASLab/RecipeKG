I find this very important. \nI made a version with strawberries, because I had some pink ladyfingers available, but I'm sure the original recipe is also really good.\nI made the espresso with instant coffee because i don't have an espresso machine and I like to have a good kick of coffee. I think the coffee taste is essential for having a good tiramisu.\nI didn't have brandy available, so I used some chocolate flavored vodka, which I also mixed through the coffee. The alcohol is also one of the key-ingredients and should not be left out.\nI didn't spread the cocoa powder between the layers, because I didn't read the instructions at that moment. I'm not sure if it's traditional to have this in-between layer of cocoa powder.",

Its exactly like my neighbor, who is Italian, used to make. It brought back soooo many childhood memories. I'm so excited about finding this gem, I am going to make a batch for everyone at work! Everybody should have a true tiramisu and not that garbage you buy at most grocery store bakeries. \n\nI found that many of the comments from people complaining about parts of the recipe not being specific enough for them (causing them to ruin their dessert) had to be made by very novice bakers/cooks. \n\nWith a recipe like this its more of a 'to suit your taste' and the times given for beating the egg whites is merely a suggestion and not the exact science of the recipe. I preferred mine more whipped and that's what I did; someone else may not and that's perfectly fine too. \n\nThank you so much for sharing this incredible recipe. You've made me a very happy girl!!",

This recipe is surprisingly easy to make and comes together really well once you begin assembling it. The only change I made is to quickly dip both sides of the ladyfingers in the espresso just to see what it'll do; the taste of the mascarpone mixture is spot on. I didn't have a pretty dish to put it in since I'm testing it out on my little family. It's presently chilling in the fridge and I will update after we eat it; if the mascarpone mixture is anything to go by I'm sure it'll be delish. The amount of brandy is just right -- a hint without overpowering my taste buds. 8/16/15 I just made this again to finish off the ladyfingers I had leftover from the first time I made this dish. Again this is spot on. The only change I made is to double the amount of espresso because I like to dip both sides of the cookie (so it requires more liquid). I don't like tiramisu but this recipe converted me! It's actually quite easy to make and the only time consuming part is the assembling which really doesn't. Take that's good at all.
