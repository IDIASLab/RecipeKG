Cutting down on the oil by half would probably improve it a lot but it would still be just way too sweet. I did like the decorative effect of the poppy seeds.",

You can definitely tast the sugar so half is without a doubt enough. I'm sure if you're eating sugar free (I am but since I am bringing this to a pot luck I didn't want to experiment just now) you could make it with Equal or similar. Because I didn't notice this is supposed to marinade overnight and since mine will only marinate for a couple of hours I didn't add the onions or the mushrooms. However I did a LARGE head of cauliflower and almost 2 heads of broccoli (my fave) 2 stalks of celery and took someone else's suggestion and did one red yellow and gr. pepper. And that's it! It's truly yummy!",
