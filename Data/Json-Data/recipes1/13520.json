I made this for my husband for our anniversary and it was a hit! I did take the advice from some of the other helpful reviewers (thanks guys!) and added a few changes of my own. I did add crabmeat (NOT the imitation stuff but the real lump crabmeat in a can at the refrigerated seafood counter) and I sauteed it in butter and lemon juice. I used Land O'Lakes Fat Free half and half and instead of 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning I added a packet of dry Italian dressing mix and I doubled the amount of sauteed garlic and didn't remove the pieces from the olive oil. Instead of salt and pepper I used garlic salt and lemon pepper. I served it over warm fettuccini then added more bleu cheese crumbles and lemon pepper to the top. Outstanding! I served it with a baguette and it was a very filling and scrumptious meal. Thanks for this recipe! It will definitely be a hit at our family's special events!",

The garlic oil really adds a lot of flavor and I belive makes the dish. I suppose you could use gorgonzola in place of bleu cheese if you prefer a milder flavor (gorgonzola is milder than bleu).... This tastes just like Stouffer's fettuccini alfredo! I think next time I'll experiment by using green fettuccini!Serve with an Olive Garden salad (I made my own version) and garlic breadsticks (be sure to dip them in the sauce - yum!).

I did make a few changes as I went along though including sizing it down to 2 servings. I left the garlic in since I love garlic and instead of Italian seasoning I used about a half dozen fresh basil leaves chopped. I used half and half instead of cream and it worked fine might even have been better. And last! After I tossed the sauce and pasta together I cut up a ripe tomato and a couple green onions and stirred them in. Really a wonderful dish and one I'd serve to company.",
