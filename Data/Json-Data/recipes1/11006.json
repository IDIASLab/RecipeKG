I have to say these came out \"OK\" but weren't great. Definitely too much oil. I beat my eggs with the oil for about 2 minutes and I think that helped keep it from separating while cooking (I didn't have pools of oil like other reviewers). But after these cooled and set they are still just too oily for my taste. I added some chocolate chips and I think that helped with the flavor because they are otherwise kind of bland. BUT - it satisfied a craving when our pantry was very low stocked. If you have access to more ingredients there are definitely better recipes out there.",
