I decided it needed just a bit of pizaaz so added sev good dashes of Worchestershire plus some horseradish and a good sprinkle of Tony C's Cajun seasoning & it really was very good. Will make again but am thinking of trying 1 cream of onion & 1 of mushroom.",

I needed a quick fix for dinner so I didn't have the time for the meatballs to savor overnight but I cooked browned frozen meatballs in EVOO and added mushrooms and onions, stirred in the mushroom soup, water and sour cream and let it simmer for 30 mins. Yummy! Thx for the idea. The whole fam loved it!",

I didn't have egg noodles so I used pasta shells. My family said this is a new dish they want me to keep making. So easy and simple to toss ingredients in and cook in slow cooker. This is a keeper!",
