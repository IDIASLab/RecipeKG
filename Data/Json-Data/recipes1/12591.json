I made it exact the first time, my family said it was \"too sweet\".  (As if there were such a thing...but they are not that into sweets & when they do have them, they tend to think they have more sweetness than other people.)  When I made it a second time, I cut the amount of sugar in half.  Still \"too sweet\" for some family.  I cut the sugar all the way down to 1/3 cup.  Just right for them.  AND, it still tastes sweet to those who DO eat sweets a lot & like the sweetness.  I also changed from regular peanut butter to \"natural\" peanut butter on the most recent pie...and I think that toned some of the sweet down also.  The *only* reason I changed the sugar amount originally was b/c of my family.  I love the original...and I like the less sugar versions I made also.",
