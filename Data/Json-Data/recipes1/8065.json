This is funny as we are HUGE garlic and onion fans and usually add a lot more than is required after we test a new recipe.",

I used white wine vinegar which is milder, subbed light buttermilk for the lemon juice, reduced the parsley and added a pinch of sugar.

I skipped the lemon juice because I didn't have any, used 1 tsp of onion powder instead of chopped onion and kept the fresh garlic. You can really taste each individual flavor in the end and letting it sit for at least an hour is a must. It became a completely different dressing after it was sitting for a while. Very, very good and we will definitely be making it again to accompany wing night.",
