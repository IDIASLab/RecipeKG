It was pretty runny, though. More like a cobbler.  Maybe my berries were extra juicy.  I'll increase the flour by 1/3 the next time.  Also, the edges burned quickly at 450 degrees.  I may either bake it all at one temp - or at 400 for the first period instead of 450.  But overall...a very nice pie.",

He even thought that the super-cheap Safeway frozen pie crust was of my own creation. The only thing I did differently was that I substituted Earth Balance (butter substitute) for the butter. I really do think that Earth Balance makes everything taste better so dotting the pie crust AND the fruit with melted EB makes a difference. I highly recommend this recipe. It's so easy too!

The pie never seems to last more than a day..two at the most and it's only me and my husband.  We can't stop eating it.  I usually eyeball the ingredients(adding a little more flour if the berries are fresh and extra juicy) I also use Splenda instead of sugar. I've always used the Pillsbury pie dough (very easy) and the only thing I do differently is to wash the top with a little half and half and sprinkle with brown sugar (a little more that a tsp) over the top crust. I've also used a mixture of frozen berries (sometimes assorted) with fresh if I come up short on the amount needed to fill the pie tin. Always turns out perfect! This is a keeper!",
