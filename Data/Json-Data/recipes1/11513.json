I also made a few more changes: used 2 onions instead of 1, added garlic and 1/2 lb. of sliced mushrooms to the onions as they sauteed. These changes were based upon previous reviews. The cooking time may need to be adjusted as well. I found that the broth was not absorbed in the 20 minutes it suggested so I had to cook it for about 30 minutes. I plan on making this many, many times.",

A few alterations:  I used 3 onions instead of 1 (they shrink down so much when caramelized), 2 garlic cloves, and only a tablespoon of balsamic (and that was PLENTY).  This was an amazing dish...well worth the time (took nearly an hour and a half from start to finish).  Left out the thyme at the end...instead sprinkled it with parmesan.  Can't say enough good things about this dish!\nP.S. It really doesn't matter how you prepare the chicken, you can barely taste it in the dish!\nP.P.S. Used a dry Pinot Grigio for the wine...wonderful!",
