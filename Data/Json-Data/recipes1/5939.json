I was looking at the picture trying to figure out why the edges had gone flush with the pan and burned so I tried this recipie. Turns out the dough is too sticky. I had to add another half cup of oats. Oatmeal cookies should be sticky but should not 'melt' in the oven. I also added baking powder for a fluffier oatmeal cookie and substituted walnuts for raisons. I also cut the white sugar in half and added brown sugar as is customary in oatmeal cookies. I think the original recipie functions more like 'drop' cookies.",
