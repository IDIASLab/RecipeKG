When i fried the bacon i added some minced garlic and finely diced onion. This recipe doesn't call for salt but i am glad i added it. It really brought all the flavours together. Although this is a simple recipe and easy to make be prepared for lots of cleanup (lots of dishes):). I would definately make this again...its a keeper.",

Well we compromised and made both! I have never made homemade mac n cheese but this recipe looked interesting and easy for a beginner. On the first try I followed the recipe exactly...but after adding the chedded cheddar cheese...it began to get clumpy and greasy. I threw it out and started the cheese sauce again only instead of cheddar I used american cheese. Well at least this was creamier but I didn't like it any better. Besides my roommate who thought this was \"okay \" no one really liked this. As I was about to throw what was left my roommate said he'd just eat the leftovers tommorrow at work...which was the only thing that saved these from going in the trash. I attribute the failure partly due to my inexperience in making homemade mac n cheese but I will try to gain experience from other mac n cheese recipes found on this site. Thanks anyways.",
