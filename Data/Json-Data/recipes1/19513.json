I added a tablespoon of minced garlic (roughly who actually measures garlic) and half of a sweet onion. Alas I did not have any peppers so i added about a tablespoon of chili garlic sauce (the jar with the rooster on it) and the sprinkle of salt lime juice and 1/4 cup of packed cilantro. I did make two batches and in one batch i added some green chilies i had left over in the fridge. That batch came out good but not as thick and flavorful as the other batch. I think this is a great starter recipe to doctor with your own preferences.",
