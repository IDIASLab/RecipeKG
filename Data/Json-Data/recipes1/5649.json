I went ahead and followed the directions, but instead of using milk, I substituted it with heavy whipping cream.  I chopped the onions, instead of slicing them.  I also added a few tablespoons of tomato puree, I added some more worestshire sauce and some more chayenne pepper and VIOLA! The recipe was perfected.  Oh... I also let it cook on low heat for about 1 hour.  The trick to this recipe is to allow it to simmer.  Wilma, you had the right idea, but you just needed a little more special additions to your recipe to make it perfect.  Thank you for giving me the basics.  This has become one of my family's favorite!  Michi in Miami",

                "reviewBody": "I discovered that it's possible to purchase a 12oz bag of frozen Australian slipper lobster tails at Trader Joe's for $8.99 so that's what I used. This soup was excellent! The lobster tails were raw and had to be sauteed. I reduced the liquid from them and added it to the soup. I made the following modifications: doubled the flour and butter, used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup reduced fat milk instead of two cups milk, added about 3 tbsp tomato paste, and used the extra cayenne pepper, extra Worcestershire sauce plus black pepper, parsley and garlic powder suggested in earlier reviews, and I simmered the soup for about an hour and a half. The one change I would make next time: I thought that simmering the lobster overcooked it and made it a bit tough. Next time I would add the lobster just before serving. Even better than the little Italian restaurant in my neighborhood. Will definitely make this again (and again).",

I like others changed a few things, I used one cup of milk and one cup of half-and-half, instead of an onion I used one small shallot, two tabelspoons of tomatoe paste (just enough to make the soup a little pink), I added a touch of old bay seasoning, a spalsh of garlic powder. Other people suggested three tabelspoons of flour, mine was very thick with two. I did not use lobster I used shrimp that i put through the food processor just for a second. Voila!
