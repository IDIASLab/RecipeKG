I cooked the chicken (legs and thighs) covered with foil in the oven for about 325 for 30-45 minutes. This ensured that the chicken was cooked throughly and also made a nice seasoned sauce for the chicken to marinate in.",

The only changes I made were to use leg quarters that I separated into drumsticks and thighs and I browned the chicken in a skillet and finished it off in the oven (375 degrees F for about 30 minutes) because we were out of charcoal for our grill. I don't think cooking this on the grill would have improved our impression of the recipe though. My fiancee and my daughters felt the bread crumb mixture under the skin was \"weird\" and I thought the chicken was lacking in flavor. We all agreed it was rather greasy as well even though I used a rack in my roasting pan to allow the grease to drain away. The recipe doesn't specify what kind of curry powder to use so perhaps using a hot curry powder would have made a big difference in the flavor department. I may try this again but if I do I'll try using bone-in skin-on chicken breasts instead of legs I'll omit the bread crumbs and I'll use spicy curry powder.",
