I grated the potatoes into my salad spinner full of cold water - used that to triple rinse the potatoes and then drained them and spun the water out.  The clarified butter is perfect for these as it can cook at a higher temperature than whole butter.  I used a cast iron pan and don't flip or stir until you get a nice crisp bottom - then flip and stir and crisp up the rest.  Excellent!",

I had given up on using fresh potatoes for hash browns & had turned to frozen. I used my food processor to grate an entire big yellow onion. Next I grated 8 russets & added that to the onion. Yum - I kept flipping these to make sure all of it turned brown & yummy! Rinsing potatoes in cold water, like rice. Who knew! Love that I learn something new all the time on this site!",

A tip that I learned long ago is to press the shredded potatoes in a potato ricer, after soaking & rinsing time, while holding the ricer upside down, you're pressing a lot of water out this way. Then pat dry with paper towels. You're not going to press the raw potatoes through the ricer, you're just pressing more water out of the potatoes more efficiently. I used 1/2 shortening and half butter to fry the potatoes in, like my mother always did.",

I didn't have paper towels to pat the potatoes dry so after draining the cold water off of them the second time I just put a bowl under the strainer with the drained potatoes in it and used a small plate to press them down some and squeeze some of the excess water off. This worked fine. I added some red and green pepper strips and onions (had a bag of frozen ones), some chopped ham and a little shredded cheddar cheese. A few minutes before they were done I poured a couple of eggs that I had previously scrambled in a bowl with a little milk over the potato, onion, ham, and peppers mixture and cooked up while mixing some and made one of those breakfast bowl type dishes, with rye toast on the side.

I make a huge pan of these and cook them just until a little brown and hot all the way through but not real brown. then I  cut it into 6 to 8 pieces and wrap in foil and slide them into a storage bag. That way I  have some made ahead and can save time by just getting one out of the fridge every morning and browning it in butter or bacon grease. My husband eats them every day so there is no spoilage. We use them up fast.",
