The sauce still seemed a little chunky so I removed a little more than half of the pineapple and whirled it through the food processor and added it back in. I omitted the flour and used corn starch instead as I wanted the sauce to have a more glazed look. I also made my own beer batter for the fish. Everyone enjoyed this very much. Thanks Anna!",

Seasoned peices with salt pepper and floured them lightly and sauted in 2 Tbs. hot oil. Added chopped bell pepper and onion in bite size peices and the pineapple chunks. Added reserved pineapple juice to soy sauce sugar ketchup 1 tablespoon rice vinegar instead of water and only 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil. The flour dredged fish pieces thickened the sauce perfectly without using the flour in the liquid mixture. Poured sauce over fish in last seconds of saute and served over Chinese style sticky rice. Whoa. Hubby wanted to know why I hadn't made this before! Flavor was excellent super easy and on hand ingredients made this a real winner. We look forward to having this again. Thank you for sharing! My 2nd time with this. Replaced flour with cornstarch and proceeded as with first time. Really Really good served over hot sticky rice. Definitely a keeper!!",
