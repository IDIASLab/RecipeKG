Maybe add a small amount of Worchester or something. I also did not make it into a ball. I used a glass pie plate put the Brauschweiger in first and then the cheese mayo mixture. You could line a pan with plastic wrap put the cheese mayo mixture in first then add the Brauschweiger and invert it and it would be beautiful.",

Additions I made were to add a teaspoon white pepper use tomato sauce rather than chili sauce. Then after removing from the food processor folded into the mixture firmly but thoroughly 1/4 cup finely chopped pistachios and three tablespoons capers. Delicious! Even my 12 year old granddaughter couldn't get enough! Thank you Michael for sharing something new and very tasty.",
