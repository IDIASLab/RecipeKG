My six year old ate two small bowls without complaint. However I added an extra cup of chicken broth and 1 cup dry noodles when you add the tomatoes and chilie peppers. When the noodles were cooked through and the soup was ready to serve we topped each bowl with a little chedder cheese. This may have reduced the heat somewhat. Will be making this quick and easy soup again!",
