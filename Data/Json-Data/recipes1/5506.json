I wouldn't hesistate using this same marinade for shrimp either!  I pan-fried instead of grilling - used cooking spray, and cooked on med. high heat for about 4 minutes on each side.  The second time I made this, I used fresh rosemary - what a difference it made!  I think I'll omit the lemon from the olive oil drizzle - was too lemony, and it overpowered the fresh rosemary.  I served this with \"Couscous with Mushrooms and Sun-Dried Tomatoes\" from this site, and they really went well together. Thanks for the recipe!",
