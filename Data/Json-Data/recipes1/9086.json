My substitution was to use bittersweet chocolate instead of unsweetened and then I reduced both the corn syrup and sugar to 1/2 cup each. It perfectly filled a store-bought Oreo crust and we topped it with a whipped cream piping and chocolate shavings. I will definitely make this pie again - it is so much lighter than a cream pie and is non-dairy without whipped cream topping.",
