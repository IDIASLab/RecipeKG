It took several tries to prevent tearing and to sufficently seal the edges together. Once mastered though, this recipe rocked!  I followed another reviewer's advice and used a generous amount of cayenne pepper which gave the ravioli a nice kick. In case anyone else doesn't have mascarpone cheese stocked in their fridge, a mixture of 8 oz. cream cheese, 2 1/2 tbs sour cream, and 1/4 c. heavy whipping cream in lieu of the mascarpone cheese works perfectly.",

I did use acorn squash instead of butternut because that is what I had.  I also made some changes that made this a little healthier.  I used 2 oz. of Neufatel cheese (a lower fat cream cheese) and two tablespoons of Parmesan instead of the cheese suggested.  I also used a teaspoon of maple syrup in the mixture.  Lastly, I topped the ravioli with roasted walnuts and served it with a spinach salad and roasted brussel sprouts.  This takes a little longer than implied, but so worth the time investment.  I great vegetarian dish.",

SO good. will definitely make again and again. oh also this recipe made a lot so i froze a bunch (laid out on a baking sheet to freeze then threw them all in a bag) and cooked about 3 min until the raviolis floated to the top.",

First less is more. Putting more than the teaspoon recommended makes the ravioli too rich. We all preferred the raviolis with less butternut squash mixture. Secondly when you cook the raviolis in butter do only one layer at a time. Otherwise the raviolis stick. I would do two batches with half of the butter in each. Lastly I substituted the mascarpone cheese for light cream cheese and it was delicious! Thanks for a recipe that we will surely make again - for simple family dinners and important guests alike.",

Added a little extra cayenne just to give it a slight kick.  I was unable to purchase wonton wrappers and instead purchased a 16 oz package of egg roll wrappers.  Cut into quarters and made triangle shaped ravioli.  The doubled filling was perfect for the amount of wrappers I had.  Used about 3/4 of a teaspoon of filling in each wrapper.  The fresh snipped sage and fresh peppered parmesan were elegant.",

The taste is a little different but not a deal breaker. The raviolis I'd had of this type before were more sweet so I sprinkled the top with cinnamon in addition to the parmesan and I added pears cooked with brown sugar as a garnish made it extra tasty. I froze a lot of them to save for later they still taste great. I just placed them on a cookie sheet in the freezer until they were hard enough to transfer to a freezer bag. Easy. You don't have to fry them up in butter if you're looking to save calories (it's just that butter makes everything taste good)--I did it both with and without. The wonton wrappers are a perfect substitute. It's definitely a recipe you must try!",
