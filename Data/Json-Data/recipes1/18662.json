Cooked mushrooms until they had lost their juices and were starting to brown, then added about 3 cups of spinach along with the other ingredients.  Used reduced-fat cheddar cheese and light sour cream.  Processed the mixture briefly to get a more uniform chop.  Held dip in the refrigerator about 4 hours before baking...husband waited to tell me AFTER I'd put it together that he's not all that fond of mushrooms (8 years married, and he can still surprise me!), but I liked it, and my company liked it.  I'd make it again, but I think I'd use a different cheese...Gruyere or Swiss would probably be excellent.  Thanks for a keeper!",

The taste of the mushrooms ,  and spices were just o.k. ,  and think it would have been better if fresh were used ,  instead of dried .  This was very mediocre for us ,  and would not make as directed again .  Maybe with less butter ,  and fresh herbs  and spices .  Sorry for the bad review .  Thanks for sharing .",
