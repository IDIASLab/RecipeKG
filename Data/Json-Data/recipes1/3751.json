I used the leftovers in this dish (rather than smoked salmon). I also used Prego tomato sauce with sausage rather than the tomato paste. I didn't have any onion (unfortunately, because I LOVE onion) so I omitted the onion. I used more pesto than called for and no basil or garlic because the pesto sauce had plenty of both. I added a can of chopped tomatoes and a can of green peas (just because I love them) in with the freshly sliced mushrooms and sauteed them all in olive oil. I then mixed all of the ingredients together (including the pasta and the salmon) in a pot then heated it all on a burner. The turn out? DELICIOUS!",

That helped a lot but 2nd time round we also replaced the water with white wine and that turned out to be the prefect combination. will definitely be making again.:)",
