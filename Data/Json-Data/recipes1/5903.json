But not overly tangy tart it's partly an after taste. I followed exactly to the T but realized that I had a deep dish 9 inch pie. So the ingredients didn't fill the pie all the way. I assumed it would be like a pecan pie. But didn't rise like one at all. So It's sitting on the bottom rack of the oven temp is 325 (have a thermometer inside)...30 minutes comes and it's not even lightly golden at all. So I kept looking about 45 minutes it was lightly brown. Pull it out and let it cool for 3 hours before I cut it the inside ran out so perplexed. The center was still a bit goopy. So Honestly. I don't know if that was suppose to be that way. Sorry.",
