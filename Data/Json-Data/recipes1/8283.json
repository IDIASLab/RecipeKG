Having last-minute guests and wanting a great meal, instead of boiling potatoes and mashing them, I found the instant mashed potatoes in my cupboard and made some according to the box that would serve 10.  I then mixed the cooked mashed potatoes with the remaining ingrediants and baked as directed.  The last 10 minutes, I sprinkled cheese and bacon bits over the top and baked again until melted.  GREAT GREAT potatoes.  They were devoured! Thanks Beth...I'll do in the right way next time.",

I made sure to save it to my recipe box this time. These are great the cheese and sour cream add a real richness to the potatoes that you can't get with just butter and milk. My grandfather who hates both cream cheese and sour cream loved them. We just didn't tell him the truth about what he was eating.
