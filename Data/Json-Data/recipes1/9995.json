However - one change I make - when adding all the veggies & meat to the bacon grease also add appx 1 cup of water. Cover & simmer for about 20-30 minutes then drain water add bacon and serve. This ensures the potatoes & other veggies will fully cook. This dish is an all-time favorite!!",

Also I used a little more bacon and seasoned it all with some garlic and onion powder. Very tasty meal! We loved it and wanted more when it was all gone! Some of us sprinkled a little cheese over our bowl but was good without it too! Will make this again! Thanks Lillian and your creative mother!!",

I put all the veggies in a glass pan with a lid and baked in the oven at 350 for 1 hr. Then I added the sausage to the top and baked another hour. Next time I will add the brocolli after the first hour but all in all the flavor was wonderful. I'm sure it would be great on the stove if you slice the potatoes very thin like the recipe says. I cut mine into half inch thick slices. Didn't even need butter and salt!",
