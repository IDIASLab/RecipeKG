I eat a lot of Kale, and unless its fresh from the garden (usually after the first frost), I tend to cook it for around 15 minutes to prevent it tasting rubbery.  First if I have a large bunch of kale I'll thinly slice a whole bulb of garlic, because I love garlic.  If I add the garlic first, it burns, so I cook the kale for a good 10 minutes before adding the garlic.  To cut down on oil, I'll cut up the kale and then rinse it off in the strainer.  I use the water left on the kale leaves combined with a dash of oil to saute it.  And finally I add some salt and pepper.",

I put this as a side dish with oven-baked chicken legs and it turned out very nicely. Warning to any new to kale: it's rather bitter and has a similar taste/testure to spinach. This was incredibly easy and flavourful so I will definitely make it again. Next time I will make a couple changes: 1. 6 cloves of garlic added AFTER the kale (when you add garlic first you risk burning and wrecking the flavour; it is MUCH tastier when added in the last 1-2 mins when cooking it by sautee). Like some others I just prefer more garlic. 2. Adding some salt or sugar to offset the bitterness. I may try steaming (as others suggested) by putting the kale in a microwave-safe dish with a little water for a few minutes (I need to buy a new steamer and I keep forgetting). Only change I made to this recipe tonight was adding a bit more oil because I cooked it in a large skillet instead of a saucepan for the larger surface area.",
