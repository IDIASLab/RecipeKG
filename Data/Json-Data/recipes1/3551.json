I also just coated one side of the bread with butter NOT both sides. The one side is touched by the cheese...and then the soup mixture. I do recommend either using 2% or whole milk when you add it to the soup. I used skim and it was a very thin sauce. Tasted great though...with all the other side dishes for Thanksgiving!!!!!! Definitely NOT a low fat dish....but delicious all the same!!! I might even add less milk to the soup mixture maybe 3/4 of a cup. It was fairly liquidy!!! ENJOY. Hope this helps!",

                "reviewBody": "This was just okay as-is. Because of the description I was expecting more of a French onion soup flavor but didn't really remind me of French onion soup at all. I agree with other reviewers that this recipe calls for WAY too much butter. I only used a total of two sticks of butter (one cup) for frying the onions and dipping the bread. Any more would have made the dish extremely soupy as it was already pretty juicy anyway. It is also impossible to cook six onions in a \"small pan\" as the directions state. I used my largest skillet (12-inch) and still had to cook them in two batches. Like another reviewer I cooked the onions much longer than 10-15 minutes...more like 20-25 minutes. I used a French baguette and we loved the fact that the crustiness of this bread allowed it to stay a little crunchy rather than getting soggy from the soup mixture. I did substitute Swiss cheese instead of the mozzarella as suggested thinking that would make it more like French onion soup. I also salted the onions a bit as they cooked to help draw out the juices. Even so the onions with the soup/milk mixture were still a little bit bland. This recipe definitely has potential so I'll try it again but I think I'll use cream of celery soup and beef consomme instead of the cream of chicken soup and milk to give it more of a French onion soup flavor. I also think I'll cut the baguette into croutons and toast them before using them to top the casserole.",
