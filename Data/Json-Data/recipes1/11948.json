I did changed some things though, i cut the spinach so that I only used 5oz., I added a can of drained and chopped artichoke hearts to the spinach and ricotta mixtutre, and marinated the chicken in worstishire sauce to give it a little kick. Excellent recipie! Also, if your a vegeterian you can add firm, marinated tofu instead of chicken. Enjoy!",

I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and pepper, then seared them in olive oil.  I removed them from the pan and deglazed it with a cup of white wine.  I added 3 chopped green onions and 5 cloves of crushed garlic.  I then sauteed some fresh spinach and threw all of that (except the chicken) into the ricotta cheese.  As for layering, I used the uncooked noodles and poured a cup of alfredo sauce in the bottom, then noodles, then ricotta/spinach mixture, then sliced chicken, then alfredo sauce, then italian cheese, then parm, repeat two times.  This will not fit in a 9x13 dish.  It is very rich and will feed a good sized family.  Thank you for sharing this Sybil!  I love it!",
