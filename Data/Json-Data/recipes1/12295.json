Many times people complain it s too salty but if you re sure to get the right amount of turkey (which is 1 lbs.) it should be about right. Use about 1 and 3/4 lbs. of turkey (or hamburger!) instead of the recommended 1and lbs. if you tend to be weary of salt. Cooking at a nice medium low heat does help if you are using leaner meat otherwise the outside can get overdone. Definitely consider freezing the remaining patties in the freezer! They are GREAT to remove in the morning and throw on the grill for a quick meal later on.",

Though I used extra lean ground turkey the burgers still remained quite moist. If you use extra-lean ground turkey be careful with your heat. Too much heat will burn the outsides of your burgers if you are working with extra-lean turkey. I added some low-fat Swiss cheese and with relish ketchup mustard and onions - this was a Friday night feast! To add to the healthfulness of the recipe I used eggbeaters instead of an egg and whole wheat hamburger buns. I will have this recipe again and again.",

For some reason onion soup mix works with ground turkey - I was skeptical because if you use it for ground beef burgers they end up tasting like meatloaf on a roll.
