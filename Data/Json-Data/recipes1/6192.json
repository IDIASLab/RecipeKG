The main comment I would add is that the correct hot sauce for the authentic Buffalo flavor to use is \"Durkees\" or \"Frank's Red Hot.\"\r\nOtherwise, I've been told by chefs in Buffalo that margarine, not butter, is used to get the correct consistency for the sauce. Other ingredients you can add are (any or all): Tabasco to spice up the flavor, crushed garlic, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, honey, a smidgen of prepared mustard. I am in the opinin that ketchup or tomato-based sauces should not be found anywhere near Buffalo wings. But, as is, this recipe is perfectly authentic, if that's what you're after. A+\r\n",

                "reviewBody": "I have long sought the trick behind great wings. This recipe reveals it. Keep it simple. The second step is the secret. Instead of dumping lots of hot sauce on the wings put the wings in the sauce. I usually use more hot pepper sauce but my family and friends love spicy food. Interestingly if you accidentally make the sauce too hot adding a little more vinegar reduces the heat. I don't know why but it does. I sometimes fry the chicken in advance and then reheat them very slowly with the sauce in a covered pan. It's easier when I have folks over to watch the game. Reheat slowly as if you try to rush this they will be dry. My twist on this in what is probably a vain attempt to make these a little healther is to use thighs instead of wings. I get some good sized thighs trim off the fat and cut them into three pieces. One cut one each side of the bone leaving a nice amount of meat on the bone. Be careful though as these fry more quickly than wings. But everyone loves them; some prefer the boneless strips and others go for the piece with the bone. Nonetheless whether you use my thigh trick or use the wings this recipe is the real thing. Thank you Ginger.",

Use Marie's Blue Cheese Dressing with added crumbled blue cheese and serve with celery sticks and you have an awesome appetizer/meal.",
