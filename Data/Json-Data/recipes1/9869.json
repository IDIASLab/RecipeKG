Then to suit my own tastes I put half cup mayo and half cup cream cheese. If you use yogurt BEWARE! If you blend all the ingredients together you will get a soupy mess so the trick is to chop the onion and garlic very finely (pref. in a blender) and then stir that into the cream cheese and mayo mix. Last but not least fold in the yogurt. I also added a little garlic salt for some extra kick and the end result was DIVINE if you are an onion lover. My version is definitely not kid friendly.",
