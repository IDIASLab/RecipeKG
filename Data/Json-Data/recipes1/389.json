Was looking for Christmas cookie recipes to use up extra kisses from my wedding reception... ended up buying more kisses to make more cookies! The pb taste isn't over-roasted or overwhelming like most pb cookies. Nice and sweet but not too sweet. Don't bake them too long or the edges will separate when you press in the kiss. They may seem doughy when you add the kiss but after returning to the oven to melt the kiss a bit they are just perfect! They stayed soft and delish even days after baking and looked cute too.",

This is essentially the same recipe as on the Hershey's website except they say to insert the chocolate when the cookies are done - not to put back in oven afterwards. And that is how I made them. I think the chocolate would get way too soft/melty if you put back in oven. Using the recipe as is I ended up with 35 cookies - of course it depends on how big you make them - they look cuter smaller. I prefer these with the Hershey's kisses with almonds.",
