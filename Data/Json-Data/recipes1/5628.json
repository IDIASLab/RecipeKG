I can't really pinpoint why I didn't love these. I took a star off for flavor and one for presentation. After scoring the eggs they kind of fall apart as you cut them (see photo...it was the best I could do). And the sauce looks kind of oily on the plate. I would cut back to just a few drops on that. Thanks for posting.",
