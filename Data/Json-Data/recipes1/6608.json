First the tripe, before boiling we usually remove all the fat and bring to a boil very very slowly about 4hrs for the same serving as this recipe calls for. For the chili two or three dried red chili peppers are placed in a blender with some of the broth from the tripe and onions, pinch of salt and blend away. This is then mixed with the tripe simer a little longer and serve with the trimings. My MoM showed me this and friends and my family can't get enough.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is pretty basic.  The 1st thing I learned about menudo from my mom was \"throw\" the tripe (always honeycomb tripe) into the sink, cover with water, put in a lot of sliced lemon and let it soak for at least an hour.  The 2nd was to use lots of garlic.  I generally buy, from a Mexican market, 9-10lbs of the honeycomb, 2 patas (beef feet) cut into pieces and use about 4 heads of garlic - the cloves peeled & sliced\r\ninto lengthwise slivers.  The lemon gets discarded, the tripe (unrinsed) cut into small pieces, put into my trusty 16qt pot, along with the beef feet and about 1 to 1 1/2 chopped onions.  I also put in some chopped green pepper - a bit of bell and poblano - - about the equivalent of half a bell pepper.\r\n\r\nAfter it comes to a boil, I change it to simmer and do NOT dump the cooking water.  When a lot of fat has accumulated, I skim it off, using the fat skimmer and then add the oregano, salt 'n pepper.  After a couple hours, in goes goes the hominy.  It continues simmering for a couple more hours, or until it's nice 'n tender and not rubbery.\r\n\r\nI grew up accustomed to \"white\" menudo and did make the red menudo once - not again.  We prefer the white.  I will add crushed red pepper flakes to my bowl, however!  And sometimes some salsa.  (that does not equate to red menudo in my mind!)",
