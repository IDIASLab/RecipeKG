Cod is a mild, flaky white fish that is not expensive and is absolutely reliable in my experience (i.e., not fishy).  Prepared this way it is tender, flaky and perfectly done, but obviously the cooking time will depend upon how thick your fish is.  I have never added wine to the pan, however, and decided to give it a try.  While I didn\u2019t find it detracted from the dish, it didn\u2019t add anything either \u2013 so I would say drink it instead. I used bread crumbs instead of \u201cbuttery round crackers,\u201d as I generally don\u2019t keep \u201cbuttery round crackers\u201d (such as Ritz) on hand.  I added enough melted butter to moisten the crumbs, along with fresh minced garlic, parsley and rosemary.  (Yum)  I gave the fish a little salt and pepper before topping with my seasoned bread crumbs, then popped it into the oven for 20 minutes.  In other words, I skipped the two-step process directed in the recipe as I didn\u2019t find it at all necessary.  As it always is, this was delicious. I served it over wilted spinach, tho\u2019 I would have loved it with some pasta with garlic and olive oil too.  (I was disciplined tonight since Hubs is out of town)  For those not confident making fish, this is a great choice.  For those who ARE confident making fish, this is a great choice.",

Here's how to kick up the  flavor and get a less mushy texture..  I use a ream of whole wheat RITZ crackers.. crush them up, throw in a teaspoon of onion powder, teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp fresh parsley, 1 tsp basil, and 1/2 tsp of oregano.  Mix those all together,two dashes of salt, dash of black pepper.  Next melt 2 tbsp of butter with 1/4 cup of SUTTER HOMES CHARDONAY (this is very important..don't use just any wine) in a small dish or measuring cup.  I line my pan with foil, spray with a non stick cooking spray, put the fish down flat in the pan.  Pour the melted wine/butter over the fish.  Next evenly pour the breadcrumbs on top of the fish.  Pat down lightly.   Next you melt two tablespoons of butter, and drizzle evenly on top of the breadcrumbs.  Lastly, sprinkle a little more black pepper and bake for 23 minutes at 400 degrees farenheit.  This comes out perfect! No mush, nice and tender, flaky and VERY flavorful!",

I had cod filets instead of loins, but 20 minutes was all it took.  I didn't have fresh parsley on hand so I mixed dried parsley in with the cracker mixture.  I added a minced clove of garlic too.  I seasoned my cod filets with a little salt/pepper before adding the topping.  I would recommend putting the topping on right away, and cooking the filets for a total 20 minutes uninterrupted.  I think the topping would get a little crispier that way.",
