I marinated about 3 cups of cherry tomatoes that I cut in half lengthwise, cut the olive oil down to 1/4 cup, used 1/4 cup of finely chopped red onion and doubled the amount of fresh basil.  I added 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes, a bit of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes, and a couple splashes of balsamic vinegar.  I let everything marinate along with the garlic, salt and pepper for a few hours at room temp. Boiled some penne pasta then tossed it with the feta and parmesan.  This was a meal all in itself, but was a great side dish for some grilled italian marinated chicken.",

I then added 1 pint of grape tomatoes, added salt and pepper,  and let them cook until they started to burst.  This really adds a punch and thickens the sauce a little.  I rolled the basil leaves up together and julienned them instead of leaving them whole and added this to the tomato mixture.  I let this sit until I cooked the pasta.  I drained the pasta and ran cold water over it to get it to room temperature.  Put the pasta in a bowl and added the Parmesan Cheese.  I buy marinated feta cheese from a local stand.  Mix the parmesan and feta with the pasta and then add the tomato mixture.  Very tasty!",

But here are some ideas that might give people what they're looking for. I made it a second time with these adjustments and it was very good. I added pitted and chopped Kalamata olives which gave a nice savory bite and boosted flavor. I took a handful of grape tomatoes cut each in half sprinkled w/Na & olive oil then roasted. This brought out the natural sugars & gave the dish more dimension. I also added a small pkg of baby spinach and wilted it within the dish while everything was still hot. This adds tons of nutrition and adds color and flavor as well. I also used herbed feta which of course boosts the flavor. I'm also thinking that using a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes would lend even more flavor and depth. Dry herbs are generally more flavorful than fresh so that's something to keep in mind. Dried basil would be more flavorful than fresh. I would also leave out the fresh onion it is too pungent to taste good and I personally don't think it's necessary and adds nothing but a strong onion flavor & an odd crash of textures that don't go well together. Something to think about......:)",
