I gave it four stars ONLY because we made a few changes...to us it wasn't hot enough even our picky 4 & 5 yr old \"non-spicy-eating\" daughters ate it. This could just have been the jalapeno peppers I got which vary due to ripeness etc so I plan on doubling up or leaving in some seeds this year. Also we used 100% cranberry/pomegranate juice in place of the water (YUM!) and omitted the sherry based on other comments. Finally I pureed the finished product and while it seemed a little thin while hot it jelled up nicely if you prefer a smoother consistency.",

If you don't like it hot but still want the flavor of jalapeno be sure to get all the seeds and the white parts out of the inside of the pepper. I fill my sink with water and cut the pepper in half under the water. Then take a baby spoon and scoup out all the seeds underwater. Be sure you wear gloves when you do this or you'll feel the heat for a couuple days! I used 2 peppers cleaned and diced fine and the flavor is perfect and not overpowering at all.",
