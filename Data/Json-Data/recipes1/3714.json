The dough is softer and they come out very chewy. I also subbed 1/4 cup brown sugar because I like a chewier cookie. I always use some whole wheat flour too. You can't even tell the difference in this cookie. Also do NOT overbake. I baked mine for no longer than 9 mins and they were just starting to firm up. That is the perfect time to take them out of the oven. With less flour and less baking time they are very chewy and flavorful!",
