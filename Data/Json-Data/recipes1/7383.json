                "reviewBody": "I've been doing ribs by this method for years and you appreciate it even more in winter where grilling 5-6 hr ribs is not an option.  (In winter, you would finish this recipe off topped with the sauce in a 450 degree oven instead of on the grill.)  A few suggestions from my experience.  I add a bit of liquid smoke to the vinegar mixture so that it permeates the ribs when baking (also throw in a few cloves of garlic, bay leaf, salt and pepper).  I take off the foil after 45 minutes of baking but continue baking until the yummy liquid evaporates(the flavor gets more concentrated in the meat that way).  The beauty is that this step can be done even a few days ahead.  When done baking, I just let the ribs cool and refrigerate until I need them.  Then, just take out 1 hr before party/ dinner, baste generously w/sauce and grill/ bake until nice in color.  Perfect for treating kids to their favorite dinner in the middle of the week even for a busy mom/ dad or for throwing a no hassle BBQ party.",

I didn't grill them, after cooking them with water and vinegar for an hr. and making the sauce, I marinated the ribs in the sauce for about 1-1/2 hrs. Then baked them in the oven on 350 covered for 45min, then uncovered for 10min. They came out PERFECT!! Meat just about fell off the bone and the sauce is wonderful!! The hot pepper sauce was hardly noticed so I might add just a little more next time (hubby likes spicey foods). These would be excellent for a barbecue get together!!  Thanx for the great recipe!!  :)",

That was good!\" I knew I had a winner! \r\nGiven the time to do this properly, this stuff came out DELICIOUS!!!! Pork was just falling off of the bones! I used country style ribs, added 20 minutes on the oven time due to thickness of the meat, and added in about 1/4 cup more brown sugar to give the pork a sweeter, thicker taste. \r\n\r\nYou cannot go wrong on this!

Added a little more brown sugar.  After the required grilling time, my husband wrapped each rack of ribs in heavy duty foil and put back on the top grill to steam for a few minutes.  Let sit in the foil for about 15 minutes before cutting.  They were fall off the bone good!!  Being from the Lone Star State, I was a little skeptical about all the pre-cooking in the oven, but it was wonderful and didn't take 6-8 hours like we are used to!  Thanks Boo!",

I had bought some spare ribs on sale and wanted an easy recipe for them and this was it. My only complaint was the meat I bought was still tough after baking first for an hour then grilling. We put the ribs back into a covered roaster pan poured the remaining sauce over then baked again for another hour at 300 degrees. YUM! YUM! I'm sure baby-back ribs are more tender to begin with than spare ribs.",
