I cut it back to a couple tablespoons and added a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil so the butter would not scorch. I also used homemade chicken broth because that's all I had on hand. I used just a touch of fat free half-n-half about a quarter cup and just a touch of 2% sharp cheddar in with the half-n-half. Right before serving I used my immersion blender and buzzed the soup ingredients until smooth. This was quite good even pared down to make it lighter. GREAT with a grilled cheese sandwich. Thanks Doug!",
