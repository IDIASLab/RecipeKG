Since I was making a chocolate layer cake with no frosting I was after a moist dark chocolate cake with a rich billowy cream filling. I chose Breakstone s Triple Chocolate Bliss Cake and this filling which proved to be exactly what I was after. (I did NOT make the cookie part of this recipe) While I have purchased countless jars of Marshmallow Creme over the years I shamefully admit they ve always been tossed before I could use them. I buy another and the same thing happens over and over again. So this was the first time I have ever tasted or used Marshmallow Creme. I beat the butter powdered sugar milk and vanilla until good and fluffy then added the sticky gooey Marshmallow Creme which I just beat in until combined. I didn t have to add a thing; the consistency was perfect. On its own it tasted a little too buttery but I needn t have been concerned because it was perfect once paired with the cake. The contrast of the dark chocolate cake with this fluffy cloud-like frosting was stunning. And eye-rolling delicious. Now that I ve finally opened up a jar of this stuff after all these years of wanting to I know I won t be a stranger to it any longer. I could see frosting an entire cake with this filling pouring a rich chocolate ganache over it or using it as a filling for cupcakes or Twinkie-like cakes.",

                "reviewBody": "these should be under whoopie pies because that is what they are more similar to. BUT the taste of the cookie (but NOT the texture) part is very similar to oreos. I dropped them out by the heaping tablespoon and got about a 2 3/4\" cookie and ended up w/ about 28 finished sandwiches. The filling is really yummy. I used exactly 1 cup of marshmallow filling since I had the big jar and wasn't sure how to measure out 7oz's. I didn't think the filling was sticky or messy at all. They went together and stayed together just fine. A note to all who are going to try this recipe: the cookies do spread a little but they puff up into a dome shape and hold that shape and the texture is like cake. So if you're expecting them to look and feel like oreos - this is not the recipe for you. If you like whoopie pies and want an easy and good recipe for them - this is for you!",
