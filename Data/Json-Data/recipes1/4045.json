I popped it in the bread machine (about 50 minutes) and spread it out on a cookie sheet at about 1/2 inch thick (We like thick crust). Spread a little olive oil on it to make the crust a little crunchier. I mixed a 6oz can of tomato paste with a half jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce and put LOADS of toppings. (try turkey pepperoni it tastes the same but is way more healthy) Took exactly 15 minutes at 400 degrees. Will definitely make again and again!",
