We adjusted this recipe using Splenda sweetener and assorted flavorings including pineapple and lemon extracts.  After baking in our convection oven at 300 degrees for thirty minutes, these little meringues were just like the supermarket variety, except much cheaper.  Yum.

It sounds like you're baking them at WAY too high a temperature. 300\u00ba is a little high for any kind of meringue recipe to cook properly though. At a lower temp the inside gets a chance to dry out before the outside browns or burns. Don't forget - egg whites and sugar both burn easily. If you like a chewy interior go with the 300\u00ba and shorter baking time and know that the insides will be moist and chewy. If you like them cooked completely and prefer them crispy all the way through go with 250\u00ba or so and bake longer and slower.",

                "reviewBody": "Perhaps it was my oven but these were already evenly browned 20 minutes in so I turned the heat off and let them finish as they cooled. Even if the meringues didn't turn out as planned the brown was a lovely color so I was pleased. Another problem I had was that they were not baked through and through. so they were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I think this is because I was making meringue cups and ended up making them twice as large as they should be. This leads me to my next comment: If you've never made meringues before you should expect them to expand quite a bit in the oven. You wouldn't think something with so much extra volume beaten into it could fluff up even more but it can. So be careful when spacing them. All in all a satisfying result. Despite the 2-in-1 texture and early browning this recipe was a success: the flavor was 10 times better than any store-bought meringues that I've tried.",
