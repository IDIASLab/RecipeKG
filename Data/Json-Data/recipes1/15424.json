I didn't know to do that and ours are really hard to bite into and chew.  But, we can just barely bite into them and they are still really good!

My hubby jokes my daughter is made of scotcheroos.  :)  After making these many (MANY) times, here are my tips:  1.  Make sure you boil the syrup and sugar just the right amount.  About 30-45 seconds at full boil.  Sugar should just dissolve.  Less, and they won't stick together well, more and they'll be too hard.  2.  It's best to mix the chocolate and butterscotch chips on a double boiler or something, but in a hurry, just pour them both on top of the rice krispies, and stick them in the microwave or oven for a bit to melt, then spread them with a spatula.  Don't let them burn!  This is the way Grandma always makes it.  3.  My Aunt uses Milk chocolate chips, and people like that.  (I like the butterscotch, though.)  Just butterscotch is great for people who don't want or like chocolate.  4.  These are great in both a 9x13 pan, and a jellyroll pan.  It makes them thinner.",
