I did change up the order of operations a little by par boiling the tomatoes for 2 minutes, dipping them in ice water and sliding the skins off (long process for 25 lbs!.  Then I halved the tomatoes and threw them into the large cooking pot to simmer and start to break down.  I used my immersion blender after about 30 minutes of simmering, to break up leftover chunks.  I then took the tomatoes and put them through my food mill to strain the seeds.  The strained marinara was then seasoned with the spices etc and the onions.  It has been cooking down for about 2 hours and has probably another 3 hours to go before canning.  Thanks for a large batch recipe!",

I had 25 pounds of fresh picked Plum Tomatoes and followed the recipe using the tip from Sara, to skin the tomatoes first. I cut up the tomatoes before adding and divided the tomatoes between 2 five quart stainless steel pots. I used a 1/2 pint jar of homemade tomato sauce instead of water in each pot. I used the spices called for but doubled the quantity. I put the first pot on with the spices to get it started while working on the second giving it time to simmer the flavors incase I needed to adjust the spices.  I used 2 3/4 pound sweet onions and 10 garlic cloves chopped fine, cooked as directed. I divided the onion and garlic evenly in each pot. It is now simmering on the stove until thick enough to can, which I don't think will take more than an hour because of the tomato sauce instead of water. Great Recipe, a lot of work, but of course worth every minute. Yield is definitely off, I am hoping to get 6-7 Quarts, no way this will make 10.\nLove the New magazine....on to finding another recipe!",

I used beefsteaka nd plum tomatoes (whatever the garden offered) and added a little wine and red pepper flakes along with some fresh herbs from the garden - sage basil oregano and parsley. Next time I would use more garlic.",

I'm sure the lemon is necessary but is the amount necessaryt? its flavor is over powering and very bitter. The sauce looks great and even smells good but the bitterness of the lemon ruins it for me. It also leaves a bitter taste in my mouth long after eating it. Now I have 15 jars of marinara I can't do anhything with. I've researched other recipes and none of them call for as much lemon juice for a quart jar as this one does. The most I've seen has been a teaspoon.",
