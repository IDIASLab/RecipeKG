I'm a recipe tweaker, so I used 1/2 cup shortening (Crisco) and 1/4 cup butter melted together - just make sure the mixture is not hot when you add it to the egg mixture or you'll end up with scrambed egg.  I made all my little cookie balls first and then I rolled them in the sugar because otherwise my fingers were getting a little too sticky and the sugar mixture was getting messy.  I also tweaked the sugar - I added cinnamon, a shake of ginger and a little shake of cloves.  MMMMM...extra spice.  Then, I baked them on parchment paper lined cookie sheets at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.  PERFECT!!",
