These have a mild peanut butter taste so if you are looking for peanut butter overload look elsewhere. I halfed all of the ingredients and it ended up yielding 18 decent sized cookies. I lined my cookie sheet with parchment and 9 minutes was perfect for these. A nice soft and chewy cookie - not sure what the other reviewers are doing wrong to end up with dry cookies. This is a simple fast and delicious recipe. I sprinkled them with a bit of sugar as soon as I took them out of the oven. Will definitely make again!",

I really think you need to know your stove and pull your cookies a little before they are done because they are still cooking while they are on the cookie sheet when you remove them.",

I switched up 1/2 a cup of the white sugar for 1/2 cup of dark brown and it made them extremely moist even after sitting out all night. I also added the extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter that several reviewers recommended adding. I am not a peanut butter fan that would be my husband's department and he completely loved these he said they were better than his mother's and that's a super hard act to follow. I like the fact that these only make around 2 dozen...with only 2 of us things have a tendancy to go stale before they all get eaten. I will be using this as my peanut butter cookie recipe from now on. Thanks for the great recipe!",
