Time permitting, strain them into a saucepan, boil them down, and add them to this sauce.",

The dried porcini mushrooms were a little pricey so I used a handful of crimini mushrooms which I sauteed with the onion and carrot. I made about 1/3 of the recipe as I only had 1 turkey neck. I used a sweet red Reisling in place of the Marsala as it was what I had. I liked the idea of sauteeing the neck bone before boiling. I let the bone and vegetables simmer for about 45 minutes or so as I was making much less. For the water I used a 24 oz bottle of chicken broth for 1/3 of the recipe. My addition was a cup or two of fat skimmed broth from my turkey. I made a roux with about 3-4 tblsp each of butter and flour (the full recipe amount) slowly whisking in the strained broth. I didnt bother with the small amount of cream. The gravy was plenty rich with the extra butter. Ty and Happy Thanksgiving everyone!",
