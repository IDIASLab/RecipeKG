First I cooked the chicken in a smaller dish, cooked the thick cut bacon for three minutes in microwave before topping the chix and finally broiled the chix and bacon for 2 minutes at end. It was a beautiful golden brown. Nobody likes limp bacon. You must add flour to the drippings or it will be extremely greasy. Add as much flour as needed to soak up grease and don't take out the mushrooms. Add more heavy cream to make sauce. You want extra of this sauce!! This makes a wonderful sauce and I am an expert gravy maker. \r\n",

I cut off the bone in the breast before cooking because I don't like having to do it while I'm eating. (I still left the skin on too keep the chicken moist.) Also I'm actually a little health concious (trying to cut the fat where I can without sacrificing taste). I used PAM spray instead of the 2 tablespoons of butter. It didn't effect the taste at all. I used a teaspoon of seasoning salt and 1 clove of garlic for EACH chicken breast to give it more flavor. I cooked for about 30 minutes in the oven instead of the 45-60 as recommended. Then I brushed off the mushrooms off the chicken to the sides of the dish and placed under a broiler for 5 more minutes (to crisp the skin and bacon). I also added a little bit of cornstarch/water slurry to the sauce after I added the cream to help the thicken the sauce. But it came out wonderfully after a little bit of tweaking. Definitely a keeper!",
