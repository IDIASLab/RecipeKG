I dont think so. Also cooking fish in cream is a bad bad idea -- they turn to total mush. Admittedly I put too much cream (being unfamiliar with cooking with cream) but the recipe didnt specify that you shouldn't add ALL of the cream -- not even half of it!",

I would have given it five stars but my husband and I felt the stuffing lacked flavor. It needed something to spice it up a little bit. Could have used a tad more salt too. Maybe seasoned salt would have added some more flavor. My husband and I agreed that the next time we make it we might add a little crushed red pepper or cayenne to the stuffing.
