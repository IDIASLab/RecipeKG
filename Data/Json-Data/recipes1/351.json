I did add 1/2 the chips to the batter and right after I took them out of the oven I used a strainer and dusted powdered sugar on top. Here is a hint to cut hot brownies use a plastic knife and they will cut nice without sticking! I will be making these often and highly recommend! Thanks for the great recipe!",

If you follow the directions EXACTLY they should turn out fine. Many of the poor reviews are from people who admittedly did not follow directions which is disappointing. This recipe does not deserve bad reviews at all! Yes they are more cakelike but they are called Dump Bars not brownies. I realize the submitter said they were the best brownies but they're not really intended to be. I happen to enjoy fluffier cakelike textures so this was a perfect in-between. To the person who said they weren't sweet enough it's because of all the extra cocoa powder you used. Cocoa powder is BITTER (try eating it by itself!) Next time everyone follow the recipe and they will be great! You should all try again if you didn't like it. Also I did try another time as well with half the chocolate chips mixed into the batter and the other half on top as others suggested and it was fantastic!",
