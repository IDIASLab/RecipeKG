I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes and I didn't have cannelini beans so I used a can of baby butter beans; also no macaroni so I used thin spaghetti but really none of these changes really changed the taste of the recipe. I have to say this is a great recipe. I think the absolute key to this recipe is mixing together the butter parmasan cheese and noodles. It gives the noodles a nice texture and a nice taste. I will definitely be making this recipe again. Several times.",
