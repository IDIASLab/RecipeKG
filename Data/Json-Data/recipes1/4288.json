The secret is the ricotta, avoid the cheap stuff for the best consistancy (I use Stelle brand). I'm not much of a cook and this cake ALWAYS works. To decorate, use marmelade as a light glaze and top with strands of orange or lemon peel. (The cake is already nice and golden...)  Enjoy",

Since I only had extra large eggs I used only five instead of the 6 the recipe calls for. I accidently cooked it too long but it didn't matter just a little browner top. Next time I'm going to try cooking it at a lower temp. and increasing the cooking time a bit. (I heard this was a good way to increase creaminess and avoid a browned top). The best part? I didn't have to wash a bunch of dishes after! The recipe requires only 1 bowl a rubber spatula and grater for the orange zest. I need more recipes like this!",

I made this cake for a group of choosy Italians and they loved it.  My changes: a) Never bake and serve the same day. Must bake overnight and chill well before serving next day. b) Line cake tin with dessert shortcrust pastry (bottom and sides). Bake blind for 10 min then add ricotta mixture. Bake for 1 hr or until firm/golden. c) Use great quality ricotta and sieve first before adding ingredients. d)  To ricotta mixture: Add rind of 1 lemon, 3-4tablespoons amaretto, \u00bc tsp almond essence, 1.5 tsp vanilla essence, grated chocolate (to taste), 75 g crushed roasted hazelnuts. I separated the egg yolks which I mixed with the sugar, essences and lemon/orange grind and folded into the ricotta. Next time I will add a little more caster sugar as the mixture can be a little low on sweetness. Whip egg whites and fold into ricotta. Once baked. Leave overnight in fridge. Next day coat with mascarpone topping.F) MASCARPONE TOPPING: Beat 250g mascarpone ( or 400g depending on size of cake) until smooth and add caster sugar to taste, vanilla essence, grated chocolate , 2 tablespoons Tia maria, lemon grind. Mix well. Coat cake top with mascarpone mixture. Grate some chocolate and sprinkle on top. Sprinkle more crushed hazelnuts for decoration. Chill well before serving until mascarpone is set (at least another 3 hours).",
