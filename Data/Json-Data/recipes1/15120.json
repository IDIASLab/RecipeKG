I did make a few changes to make it a bit healthier: I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of vegetable oil, and Eggbeaters instead of 3 eggs. I added extra coffee and vanilla as I  love both, and they turned out great! I didn't mind the texture, and I couldn't really taste the beans. To those who CAN taste the beans: try adding a little more cocoa, coffee, or vanilla next time. The additional flavors really mask the beans.",

I bake them for 26 minutes instead of the full 30 that the recipe calls for, and they are perfectly done! I also use only Ghiradelli sweetened cocoa, and Ghiradelli 60% cocoa dark chocolate chips, as well as walnuts (since I prefer walnuts in my brownies). I also add 2-3 drops of almond extract along with the vanilla extract, and I blend all ingredients in a food processor. The end result is a very chocolaty and smooth brownie where you don't get any bean texture or taste- they are just awesome!",
