It had really good flavor, but I didn't like the way the flour on the chicken got slimy on the chicken. The second time I still followed the original recipe but I left out the flour and it was perfect and that's how I'll make it from now on. The balsamic reduction was delicious. I always use portobellos as the mushrooms. Fantastic! This is one of the best recipes I have tried off this website! Other than omitting the flour this recipe needs no variations! Thanks Colleen",

Next time, I may leave out the whole flour thing because it didn't really add anything to the dish. Also, I only ended up with enough sauce for two chicken breasts instead of four (think I reduced the sauce too long). Beautiful recipe. Went great with a California Zinfindel (Campus Oaks, Lodi, 2000).  Also, I did flatten my breasts before seasoning and flouring so they would cook more evenly. Very  tender and moist chicken. Can you tell that I loved this recipe? I am planning on making this many more times for friends and for parties. THANK YOU!!!",

We reduced the sauce for about 8-10 minutes, then added the chicken back in and continued reducing for 10 minutes, then added the butter.  We browned the mushroom separately and added them in just before serving.  YUM! **Note:I made this again and didn't bother with flouring the chicken, I just sprinkled a little wondra towards the end of cooking and then added the sauce right to the pan.

                "reviewBody": "4-1/2 stars as written. However, with a few simple additions you can swing this over into the 5 star stratosphere! No treatment of the garlic cloves is mentioned, so I peeled them, crushed and very finely minced 2 of the cloves (to make the garlic flavor more pronounced,) leaving the rest whole. Also added 2 Tb finely minced shallots, which gave lots of depth of flavor. If you don't have or can't find shallots, green onions will do.  If you find the taste to be too acidic, then look to your balsamic vinegar as the culprit. The only type to use is from Modena, Italy. Others are just imitators. A genuine Modena balsamic is smooth as silk, with no bite. It costs more, but in a dish such as this, it makes a world of difference. Once the breasts are pounded thin, cooking them for 10 minutes in liquid is WAY too much. After you've browned them, they need very little time. Just make your sauce as directed (also added a little marjoram, white pepper, and a tsp Dijon mustard to increase flavor complexity,) turn off the heat, and allow your already-browned breasts to steep in the sauce covered for 10 minutes on top of the burner. This is known as carry-over cooking, and the heat of the sauce is quite sufficient to finish off any undercooked meat. Skipping the flour coating works just fine. However, to thicken the sauce enough to coat noodles or potatoes, whisk 2-3 tsp of flour to the room temp stock, then stir this into the pan, stirring until sauce reaches a boil. Finishing the sauce ",

I had to add about two tablespoons of brown sugar to try and tone down the bitterness. It also just lacked flavor overall. Compare this to something like the chicken in red wine sauce recipe on this site and you'll see what I mean. That recipe (if you follow reviewers suggested changes) is full of depth and flavor. This one -- not so much. I wanted to love this recipe but it was just lacking in a big way. There are many better chicken recipes on this site.",
