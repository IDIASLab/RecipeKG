The other (cake like)Red Velvet recipes here can't hold a candle to this one. This IS a true Red Velvet Cake. The title should say pound cake though. I think the people that have complained or not liked this particular recipe are looking for the cake like type with icing between the layers. The kind like you buy in the grocery store. To me that's not REAL Red Velvet cake though. This is like my grandma and mom always made and will always be a family favorite! If you are looking for a great moist Red Velvet pound cake this one won't disappoint you. If you like the grocery store version...there have them in the bakery section.",

Not too terribly disappointing but I have to agree with the review that calls this cake a butter cake. Red velvet cakes are dense (thanks to the vinegar) and moist. This cake was buttery with no density and the flavor of a butter cake not a chocolate cake which is really what red velvet cake is.",

Perhaps you meant buttermilk as opposed to regular milk in that aspect I can understand why it wouldn't need the vinegar as the buttermilk is quite acidic enough to allow the baking soda to rise. I will stick with my family's heirloom recipe. Thanks for trying to share though.",
