It is time consuming like an old-fashioned recipe - before the days of throw a can of soup in with something and ta-da it's done --but it's worth the effort! I made it for a Father's Day brunch; it was well received. I used 9-in pie plates and I think next time I will reduce the amount of cream as it was just a tad soft. Like someone else mentioned try a longer baking time it didn't seem done so I turned down the heat and gave it another 30 minutes. Try it with different meats and cheeses it's probably very versatile. Reminded me of a bed-and-breakfast style dish -with the fresh herbs and touch of nutmeg and almonds.",

It's a great combination of flavors but the almonds on top set it apart from any other breakfast tart you've ever had. Highly recommend this recipe. It would be very easy to adjust to individual taste. I will try some more veggies next time--bell peppers zucchini would both be tasty additions. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!",
