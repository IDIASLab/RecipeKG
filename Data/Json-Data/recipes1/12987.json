                "reviewBody": "Excellent bread! Texture was light cracked wheat adds a little crunch. The only caveat was my crust was slightly crunchy (but that was because the dough was too large for my 1.5 lb Zojirushi) and I had to continue baking the bread in the oven at 375 for another 15 minutes after the baking cycle completed. Even after that little snafu the bread still came out tasty with a light texture which will be great for sandwiches and toast! Will need to use the dough cycle next time and bake in a 9x5 loaf pan. Note: I subbed in 1-1/3 cup whole wheat flour (instead of using just 1/3 cup of whole wheat and reduced bread flour to 2 cups). Highly recommend! Thanks Sue!",

Butter instead of margarine 2 cups of bread flour 1 cup whole wheat flour and just a bit more cracked wheat. I did make one mistake and that was I soaked the cracked wheat in water that wasn't part of the bake so the hydration of the loaf was a bit wetter and had to add a bit more flour to compensate for that. Next time I'll read the directions a little better!!",
