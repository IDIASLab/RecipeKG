Then, take a knife and cut down through the inside down to the inside of the skin.  criss-cross the cuts to make little squares. You can then easily scrape the avacado chunks out or simply invert the skin so that the inside is pushed outwards. The pieces will just pop out! This works well if you want chunkier guacamole. Reserve some chunks and mash the rest.",

I like to add a little Pace Picante to mine and mince the onions instead of chopping them. Lime is definitely a must! Sometimes when I'm in a hurry, I'll add some onion flakes or powder instead.  Some people say that \"real\" guacamole has either sour cream or cream cheese.  I've  never heard of that...but I might add some next time I make this, just to see how it tastes.  A word of advice...if you keep the avacado pit in the guacamole..it will help keep it from turning brown as fast.",

I only 1/2 a lime's juice otherwise I find it too acidic. I don't put in the tomato but I do add extra garlic (at least one extra clove) and a good sized handful of chopped fresh cilantro (makes a huge difference). I also add a tablespoon of sour cream for creaminess and a little drizzzle of olive oil to help preserve it. Leftovers do not keep well but if you make sure your container is absolutely airtight you will get a couple of days before it turns brown.
