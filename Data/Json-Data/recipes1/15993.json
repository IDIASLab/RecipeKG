It shuts down the heat when the meat reaches desired temperature. I prepared the turkey per recipe, using chicken stock instead of broth. I also added 3 bay leaves for clarifying effect. I substituted the roasted tomato with diced canned tomatoes. We opted to make this recipe healthier without any additional oils or salt. The end result was spectacular. The gravy went well with the potatoes we made as well as the turkey itself.",

I didn't like how tasteless the sun dried tomatoes were after cooking so when I make this again I'll add some in the last half hour with artichoke hearts so they retain their flavor.
