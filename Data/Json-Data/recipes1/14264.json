I'm sure it would have been great as written but I made a few changes and it came out really well: I diluted a can of garlic & basil pizza sauce to use in place of the tomato sauce doubled the oregano basil and cumin and added a few drops of hot sauce to the vegetable mixture. I also cooked the rice in vegetable broth instead of plain water and added 1/2 tsp. of onion powder to the broth for even more flavour. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I cooked the rice and lentils in the same pot and instead of sprinkling the second half of the spices over top I mixed them into the remaining tomato sauce. Instead of a fresh tomato I used half a can of petite diced tomatoes. This has a great combination of vegetables but I think it could benefit from a little extra tomato sauce on top or perhaps some cayenne pepper in with the spices. Still I thought this was pretty good very healthy and I'll probably make it again.",

Obviously I modified the recipe using lentils and rice that had been precooked and that were left-overs from a previous meal. In addition I had left-over vegies from fajitas and asparagus from an omelet spaghetti sauce (homemade) and some crisp bacon. I sauteed onion garlic celery and carrots...added them to the lentils and rice with the chopped bacon. I seasoned them with hot sauce and dried red chili peppers since the fajita vegies weren't \"Italian\" seasoned. Mixed in the leftover vegies and put about 1 cup of spaghetti sauce ('gravy' in our family) on top. It was great! My husband said \"This is another one of those dishes that we can never duplicate....darn it!\" Thanks for helping me clean out the refrigerator and get dinner on the table without going to the store!!",
