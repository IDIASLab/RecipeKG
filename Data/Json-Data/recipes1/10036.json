                "reviewBody": "Judging from the reviews I knew this recipe needed a lot of tweaking. So here's what I did: I soaked the oats in the milk for about 30 minutes so the oats wouldn't absorb the liquid in the batter and make the muffins dry. I used 2 tb applesauce and 2 tb oil instead of the full 1/4 c to make them extra moist and added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Once I mixed up the batter it was very stiff do I added 1/4 c water to it. These came out nice and moist with a slightly dense chewy texture and light chocolate flavor which I liked a lot. If you want more chocolate flavor though you should probably double the amount of cocoa powder and increase the sugar to maybe about 3/4 c. This was a really nice concept for a recipe.",

Due to inattention I forgot to subtract this 1/2c milk from the later milk added and this turned out to be a good mistake. The muffins were about the right dampness. For the 1/2c oat-soaking I used vanilla soy milk then switched over to my roommate's regular milk. My main issue with the muffins is they seem to suffer from some sort of flavor personality disorder with the cocoa/raisins. Here is what I plan on doing next time: - throwing a few handfuls of chocolate chips in with the raisins. - soaking the oats in slightly more milk. - substituting in some apple sauce as recommended in another review. I could see these being pretty successful chocolate-chocolate-chip-oatmeal muffins. I wouldn't bake them the same way next time.",
