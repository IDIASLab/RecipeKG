Stir that into the egg/sugar mixture well so no clumps are left. Also, instead of whole eggs use egg yokes, make the custard as usual, then wait to cool to room temp and add the cooled cream slowly, while beating, to hard beaten egg whites (so they look like whipped cream). Beating the egg whites separately will give the cream more texture and thickness.",

I used 2/3 cup of turbinado (raw) sugar instead of the 1C and 3 TBS white sugar it called for and I would still cut that in half. Of the 4 & 2/3C milk I used 2C Rice milk 1 can evaporated and the rest heavy/whipping cream. I also added a splash each of vanilla and almond extracts. I'm pretty sure I cooked it too long because it started to get little bits in it. It stayed thinner than spoonable though the recipe does not specify if this is like the drink called boiled custard you find in The South around the holidays or the kind you eat with a spoon. All in all I think it was pretty darn good considering all the changes I made and the over cooking. Great taste and it freezes VERY nicely!!! Like really good ice cream!",

I didn't want to make the full 12 servings in case it wasn't that good...no offense Angela...so the only thing I altered with this recipe was the serving size to 4. After about 30 minutes of stirring the custard finally started thickening up. Looked like boiled custard...smelled like boiled custard...but when I tasted it the egg was the only flavor to really come through. I didn't feel like finishing off the egg shake I had made so I'll just wait until November 1st...when my local grocery store says they will carry it.",
