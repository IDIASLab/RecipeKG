Then put the potato in the sauce pan with the onion, salt and pepper them and let it fry a little so the potatoes get a nice flavor going. Then I add chicken broth and bring to a boil til the potatoes soften.Lastly the milk or cream whichever I have on hand. I always add bacon crumbles and garnish with shredded cheddar and a glop of sour cream. The only reason I don't give this recipe 5 stars is I think it needs another seasoning but I haven't quite figured out what yet. My picky husband asks me to make this all the time, though.     ",
