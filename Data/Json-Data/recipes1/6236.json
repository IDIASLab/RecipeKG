I doubled the recipe except for the peach pie filling: I left that at one can, as I didn't want it to be overly sweet or slimy. It covered perfectly! Soaking the apples and bananas in the pineapple juice is pure genius! None of the fruit turned brown. A couple of notes: Make sure you drain all your fruit well because it will get sloppy quick. And the recipe states to arrange the kiwi on top for a reason. I got lazy & simply threw them in & after a couple of turns with the spoon, they promptly fell apart. \nStill very tasty though! Thanks for the recipe!",

The peach pie filling, which by the way seemed like it might ruin the salad, really makes the whole thing!  I made this to go along with our cookout for my 2 year old's birthday party.  It was gone in no time, and I thought I had way too much.  I used fresh blueberries, kiwi, oranges, strawberries, grapes and on and on!  Not only was it great, it was beautiful served in a trifle dish, as you could see all of the bright colors!",
