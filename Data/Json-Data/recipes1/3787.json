I don't understand why you'd want to use link sausage in a lasagna recipe.  Secondly, DO NOT try to fit all of this into a 9x13 pan.  Go out and buy yourself a bigger pan - you'll be very thankful you did.  I followed the advice of others and made more sauce, which I did the day before in the crockpot so that I wouldn't have to babysit it.  I also assembled the lasagna early in the day and popped it in the oven right before my party.  This makes enough to feed a small army.  Enjoy!",

All my extended family--many of whom are food snobs--raved over it when I served it for a party. After making it twice I concluded the following changes made it party-perfect: I pre-cooked the pasta and if I hadn't I feel it would have been very dry. I also added one small can diced tomatoes to the sauce as I learned from the first time I made it it needed more sauce. I didn't particularly like the bacon and when it was ommitted it wasn't quite so heavy that way. Follow the rest as is and you'll have a winner!",

I boiled the noodles & cooked the lasagna for 45 mins. It filled up the 13x9 in pan. This was very good. Might try it again sometime with beef. Thanks. Edit: I made only the sauce today. I cooked the bacon meanwhile I chopped the onions. I put the bacon on a paper towel lined plate to drain after it was cooked. I then drained out some grease & cooked the onions chopped up the bacon meanwhile. I put the onions & the bacon in a crockpot. I cooked 1 lb of ground beef in the skillet drained & added it to the crockpot. I added the sauce & herbs to the crockpot & turned it to low & let it simmer for 8 hours. I served it over spaghetti with bread & butter on the side. This sauce is fantastic!",
