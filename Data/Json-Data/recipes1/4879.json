The flavor was yummy without it.I was excited to try something new I knew we would enjoy it. The problem was when it came out of the oven it had lost about 40 percent of its flavor. The rice apparently absorbs everything that made this yummy tasting before baking. It is a great casserole. I love the cruchiness of the waterchestnuts and the cornflakes. I will be making this again to see if I can solve the mystery of the missing flavor. Perhaps a little sherry or soy sauce? Oh I also added 1t garlic powder and some frozen peas. It was still very good even with the flavors that disappeared while baking. Maybe it really needs the salt that I left out but I felt the soup butter and mayo added enough. Thanks for sharing Behr!",
