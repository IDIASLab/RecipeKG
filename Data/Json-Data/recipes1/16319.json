Still, if it had to be written down, this is reliable and delicious.  In the spirit of personalizing it, I did make some additions, but I omitted nothing.  I removed some Italian sausage from its casing and browned that before adding the celery, onion and carrots.  I also added fresh parsley and oregano as well as both the rosemary and thyme, a good glug of red wine, a couple of Parmigiano-Reggiano rinds as it simmered, some Swiss chard as well as the zucchini and, for a more robust broth, beef broth rather than chicken broth.  We\u2019re headed out of town again first thing in the morning so this was the ideal thing to make beforehand to clear out the fridge and for ease of serving and clean-up.  If you\u2019re a novice to making minestrone, or any soup for that matter, you can make this with confidence, tho\u2019 don\u2019t hesitate to make it your own with whatever your preferences are or to use what you have on hand.",

To remedy I added 14 oz can of tomato juice 1/2 tsp EACH marjoram oregano basil onion powder & paprika and a dash of cayenne & tobasco. I simmered it another 15 minutes with the seasonings and it was delish. I also swapped kidney beans for cannellini beans used a teaspoon of dried thyme rather than a tbsp of fresh it called for and added some frozen green beans. Good soup with a little tweaking.",
