Like others who commented on this recipe, I substituted molasses for the dark corn syrup.  I did not use a bread machine, rather I mixed everything, let it rise for about an hour. punched it down, formed it into a large round loaf, and cut deep \"vents\" in a star pattern across the top and baked for about 35 minutes at 350 degrees. GREAT RECIPE!!! And easy...Update: I made this again but added 2 t. onion powder and it was AMAZING!!!",

I butter the slices and make a sandwich from Cloverdale Tangy Summer Sausage, Koop's Horseradish Mustard, and sharp cheddar.  It's wonderful!  I use real butter in the recipe.  I must CAUTION anyone that is going to try this recipe to go light on the yeast to begin with.  The top of the loaf over raised and hit the lid of my Hitachi machine four times.  I cut the amount of regular Fleischmann's Active Dry yeast each time and found that about 1-1/4 tsp. is about the correct amount. This bread has a nice crisp crust and soft cake-like texture unlike any other dark bread you may have tried. The little bit of fennel seed really does make a big difference.",

Let them raise to about double in size and baked at about 350 degree oven for 30-35 minutes. You could not find much better russian bread than this one. I make it often now. and LOVE It!
