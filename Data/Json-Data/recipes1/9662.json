A frosting alternative would be to 1) drain the remaining 1/2 of strawberries, reserving the juice 2) Cream 1 stick of softened margarine or butter with 1 lb of confectioners sugar 3) Add strawberries and 1/2 of the reserved juice 4) Add remaining juice by tsp until desired consistency is reached.  You could also cook the cake @ 350 F for 25 min (for 2- 9\" cakes) or 40-45 min (for a 13x9\" cake).  My mother has made this cake for >30 years, and it comes out great everytime.  ",

Cake is a nice pink color (which she loved) and is very moist. Instead of the strawberry icing my daughter wanted something like a \"wedding cake icing\" which I found on this site as well. I frosted it with a very thin layer of that and it was wonderful! I will definately make this again.",
