Each said it tasted good and wasn't too onion-y as one might expect from eating a bunch of onions in a pie crust.  (Even my three-year-old ate a sizeable piece of this.)  One commented that he might like to have more bacon in the recipe (but that might be because was was inclined toward more meat in a dish).  As for the recipe, I was concerned that there wasn't enough egg (I think I was expecting something more quiche-like), but in the end, everything seemed to go together quite well - meaning this recipe works.  If you like onion tart, I think this recipe will suit you.  ",

Between frying the bacon, sauteeing the onions (you will want them almost carmelized, so it takes around 30 minutes), pre-baking the shell and everything, this recipe takes a few hours. The first time I made this, I took one of the previous reviwers suggestions and cut the pie crusts into little tartlets and pressed into muffin pans.  If you do this, use non-stick spray, as 1/2 of mine broke apart trying to extract them from the pan. I also used one extra egg since mine were very small, but I think you should stick to 2 small eggs or the tart won't be flat enough. (It is not supposed to be fluffy like a quiche.) And I wasn't sure how much of the mixture to put in the shell either; I'm guessing 1/2 full. Also, if you don't want your pie shell to be too moist/soft, prick the shell on the sides and bottom before baking, and brush a light egg wash on before pre-cooking it.  Finally, I suggest slicing your onions very thin, and use the sweet yellow variety.",
