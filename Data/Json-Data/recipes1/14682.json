I seasoned the fish on each side with lemon pepper seasoning and garlic powder instead of using lemon juice. I topped the salsa mixture on the fish and squeezed a quarter of an orange over it along with a drizzle of olive oil. Sprayed a baking dish with butter flavor cooking spray and Baked in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Amazingly moist and delish! The one star was only due to my modifications.",
