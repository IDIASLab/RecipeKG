And along with the negative reviews I considered not finishing making them; since I didn't read them until after I started mixing them. But I'm glad I did because there are good. They are very tasty and the texture is a cross between crispy and brownielike. I used semi-sweet chocolate baking squares since that's all I had. I'm thinking that perhaps the nay-sayings might have interpretted the recipe wrong. In the ingredients it should say \"3 cups Frosted Flakes crushed to 1.5 cups\". Perhaps some people thought it was 3 cups of crushed flakes since that is how it reads here. But my original recipe words it correctly. Other than that I followed everything exactly and my family is enjoying eating them right now.",
