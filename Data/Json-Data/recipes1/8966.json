If you make it more traditional by using smoked hog jowles, ham hocks, or smoked pork neck bones, instead of ham, it'll taste even better. We use the water fom cooking the pork for the liquid in this dish. Also, our preference is for a can of Rotel tomatoes, drained, instead of the purred tomatoes. There are several DO NOT's if you want to keep this dish \"lucky\"\n1. Do not add chicken stock, as chickens and other fowl move backward as they eat.\n2. Do not use beef, as a cow will move forward, sideward and backwards as it grazes, whereas, a pig always \"pushes\" forward as it eats.\n3. Do not use canned peas as they've already swelled, so your luck will not \"swell\" as it will with dried peas.",

I used fresh black eyed peas and cooked them in 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 water (do not use the recipe's water measurements--way to much water!).  I only used 1 onion (b/c that's all I had) and 1 tsp onion powder.  I substituted 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic for the powder.  My can of tomatoes were petite diced w/ bell pepper, celery, & onion.  I like my beans with a bit of a kick so I also added cajun seasoning.  I only used about 1.5 cups of ham because that's all I had on hand.  Everyone loved it...even the kids! De-lish!",

Once that was soft I drained & rinsed the beans and added them to the pot. I added the canned tomatoes (roughly chopped) and covered with vegetable stock. That just simmered for about an hour (maybe less) and it turned out brilliantly. Coupled with cornbread my fiancee had his first true southern meal this New Year's Day. Yum!",

The only things I changed were to use 1 1/4 lbs of black eye peas 2 small/medium hamhocks (which were deboned and shredded after the cooking time)and 1-14 oz can petite cut tomatoes with garlic and olive oil. I used all of the other recipe ingredients that are called for to taste. Great recipe.",

(i didn't bother to crush them) also a little mixed pepper and cayenne. it was great.  thanks.",
