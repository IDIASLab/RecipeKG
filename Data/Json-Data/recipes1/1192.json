The first time I made it I made it exactly how the recipe said and it had too much of a lemon tast not enough key lime.  The second time I used a white cake mix instead and added 2 more tablespoons of key lime juice and 3 drops of green food coloring.  It turned out much better.  Overall a good recipe though.",

The other is to get the cake to live up to its name with a robust citrus flavor. Because of some experience with this I took a little liberty with this recipe which does have a good starting point particularly since it doesn't call for Jell-o! If this is a lime cake I thought it counterproductive to use a lemon cake mix and lemon pudding - I used vanilla for both. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla a tsp. of lime extract and for good measure a tablespoon of grated lime zest! For the liquid I upped the lime juice to a half cup used only a half cup of water and called it a day. As for the glaze I kept it thick adding only enough lime juice to get it to approximately the consistency of Elmer's glue. I also added a good amount of grated lime zest. It turned out to be a lovely \"graceful\" cake if there is such a thing. Light fluffy with a delicate lime taste spiked with the zestier lime glaze. I'm very pleased with this but if I make it again I may add even more lime juice zest and extract!",

I made it in a bundt pan but PLEASE NOTE: Spray an ample amount of cooking spray into the pan because it did stick and I had to 'glue' some of the top back on with the glaze. Also I drizzled half of the glaze on when it was warm which sunk into the cake and made it very moist; however I waited to apply the other half until it was cool so that it would have a visible glazed look - really great and simple recipe!!!",
