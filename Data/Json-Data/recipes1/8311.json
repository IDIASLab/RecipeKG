I probably cooked it for 45 minutes rather than 1 1/2 hours.  I think that's way too long and the chicken would have been way too dry.  I also didn't have any almonds but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I would definitely like to try it with almonds next time but it was just as good without! Yum!  This recipe is a keeper!",
