I was going to leave the topping off as suggested by others but I found the coffee taste of the filing was overwhelming without the topping to temper it. I drizzled dark chocolate over the top before cutting it into bars and placing the bars in paper muffin cups. The guests at the dinner party I brought this to actually asked if they were from a bakery! One tip: I found it hard to cut up when fresh from the refrigerator but once it had warmed up it was much easier to handle.",
