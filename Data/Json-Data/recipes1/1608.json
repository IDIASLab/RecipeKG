I divided the dough into two pieces and rolled one batch in coarsely chopped pecans and the other in gourmet white sugar. They looked beautiful, just be careful NOT to handle this cookies until they have completely cooled, or they will crumble in your very hands. Very good recipe, thanks for sharing!!! \t\t\tMoshi \r\n",

I rolled half of the balls in sugar that is two different shades of green (light and dark). I rolled the other half in a cinnamon-sugar blend, then rolled them again in red sugar. They look really pretty and have a wonderful, buttery taste. One drawback-they are slightly crumbly-but not so much that you'd be worried about carrying them to someone's house (I wouldn't mail them though).",
