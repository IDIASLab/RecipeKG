I did use some frozen stir fry veggies instead of chopping and I used 1 TBLS brown sugar and 1 TBLS white sugar when making the sauce and ommitted the salt (always can be added to taste if needed). The brown sugar, even though it was just a tbls, added a nice touch. Served over white rice and some chow-mein noodles. Very good and would make again. Thanks!",
