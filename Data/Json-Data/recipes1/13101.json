My 7 year old grandson thought it was the best thing he ever tasted.  Way to get them to eat their vegetables.  My husband wants me to make it again real soon.  I agree the slotted spoon helped alot, but the extra sauce over the top made is tasty and soft.  I just hope people can find it in the recipe search.  My friend thought eggplant might be good to try instead of zucchini. (It's a thought)",
