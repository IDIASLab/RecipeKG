An hour before serving time, I drained the juices from the fruit and added the dressing (I ended up not using all of the dressing because I didn't want it to be too runny). You could almost double the fruit and most likely have enough dressing.\r\n\r\nAlso, I did not peel the apple. I used a red apple and the skin added color. The strawberries were also a nice addition. I soaked the apples in the pineapple juice with a little Fresh Fruit in order to keep the apples from turning brown. \r\n\r\nAnd, I added the bananas right before serving.

I substituted a 1 oz. package of sugarfree instant vanilla pudding used skim milk & light sour cream & cut up pineapple rings (as my market didn't have tidbits). I didn't bother to peel the granny smith apple I used. I'd saved the drained pineapple juice; I dipped the apple in the pineapple juice & then drained it. Dipping it in the juice kept the apple from turning brown. I also added about a cup of red seedless grapes cut in half for color. I think fresh strawberries &/or blueberries would add to the presentation. After reading the other reviews I decided to make the dish the night before which I would recommend. I drained the fruit well & put the fruit (without the bananas) in a separate container & the orange juice dressing in another container in the frig overnight. I brought the 2 containers & 2 bananas to work today to a baby shower. I drained the fruit again in the morning just before I left for work as people had commented on the dish being too liquidy. Just before serving I cut up the 2 bananas into the fruit & then mixed the container of \"orange cream\" into the fruit. At least 8 people asked me for the recipe!",

Considering prior reviews indicating that it was a bit runny I took others' advice and cut the milk to 1 cup and the sour cream to 1/2 c. I mixed the fruit and cream separately and let them sit overnight (except for the apples which I added at the last minute to avoid browning). Just before serving I mixed the fruit and cream together and added cool whip to give it more volume and to avoid any runniness. It worked out great. It was not runny at all. The cool whip was light and did not detract from the orangy flavor. It held up for several hours during our cookout without having to be refrigerated. My 11 year old godson asked me the next day if I was going to make some more.",

I also added a 16 oz bag of frozen, pitted cherries, thawed, for color.  I can't imagine why anyone would think this had cheese in it, the color is a very mild, pretty orange.

I took suggestions from other reviewers and found  exactly what you need to do for a great fruit salad.  Reduce the milk to 1 cup.  Make the orange dressing the night before and refrigerate it.  This allows it to set up well.  Drain the peaches, pineapples, and oranges overnight...but save the pineapple and orange juice.  Slice the bananas and soak them in the pineapple juice overnight.  Slice the apples and soak them in the orange juice overnight.  Drain the bananas and apples, mix with other fruit and orange dressing.  I like to refrigerate it for a few hours so all the fruit is cold and the salad is mixed well, then serve.  Turns out perfect every time!
