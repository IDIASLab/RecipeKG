Also the cinnamon & nutmeg should be left out entirely. It would be much better to just take a normal white bread rescipe and add saffron. What was probably used in this was safflower not saffron. There's a big difference",

Cornwall used to grow masses of Crocus for the stamens that are saffron. The more saffron you use, the brighter the colour; howevere saffron - real saffron, not the ghastly powdered food colouring called saffron yellow is EXPENSIVE! I use about 1 teaspoon in my saffron buns. SOme recipes include dried fruit and others are a basic sweetish white bread with saffron added. The recipe would never include safflower in either its seed OR oil form!",

For efficiencies sake I'd soak the saffron in the water before starting the milk then you're working on that while the water cools. 3. I ran out of sugar so I used 1/4 cup of honey. I'm not sure if my loaf of bread is terribly different than it would have been but it still tastes great. 4. Once again I'm not sure how different it tastes but vanilla soy milk works well as a substitute for milk. 5. If you are concerned with the taste there isn't too much saffron. I think the bread tastes awesome. However if the cost of saffron bothers you I would think you could decrease it.",

Having said that this is a gorgeous bread. I don't agree that it requires less saffron; it's just enough that it can be tasted as a proper ingredient in the cake but not so much that it overpowers other flavours. The golden colour the saffron imparts to the bread is beautiful also. I added a handful of dried fruit to this recipe which I think a couple of other people did too and have found that citrus peel goes especially well with the lemon-zest in the bread mix. It does make an enormous loaf but I'll definitely factor that in when I make this again. The double-proving worked really well and I would recommend that anyone trying this uses very strong white bread flour as this gives a superb structure to the bread. Fantastic thanks.",
