If you want some color on the chicken you'd better brush it with a bit of butter after you uncover it and then bake it for the 10 uncovered minutes.",

So that's what I did--I cubed the potatoes instead of slicing and cooked in microwave about six minutes until they were practically cooked. I then just added to the chicken coated with the mixture and baked as directed. I like the flavors in this recipe but they are strong. So if you aren't a big fan of lemon or lemon pepper I wouldn't try this. To be fair though I did marinate my chicken overnight bc it was frozen so I defrosted it in the lemon cilantro marinade. Also I think this makes a lot. I scaled down to one serving but only used one chicken breast bc bf is gone this week and I have enough for leftovers. Thanks for the recipe!",
