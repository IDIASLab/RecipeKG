The only changes I suggest..for a lighter more airy texture is to use self-rising flour and omit the backing powder...or use cake flour...i believe 1 cup AP flour = 1 cup 1 TB of cake flour. Anyways...great cake!! I looove it with a caramel filling and butter frosting or caramel icing too...yummm!",

It was a beautiful cake and it got lots of oh's and ah's at the party. Everyone said it was delicious. I on the other hand thought it was a little dry even though I only baked it for 20 minutes but the flavor was very good. Also I thought the frosting was way to sweet. I wish I listened to my gut and used my regular butter cream frosting which I think would have paired better with the cake. Next time I will and I'll add buttermilk to the cake to combat the dryness.",

But it works much better when made as a bundt cake. Overall the smell and taste of the buttered pecans was heavenly! Will be making this again!",
