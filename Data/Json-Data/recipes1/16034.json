It is a mixture of browned sausage and sliced sweet apples, wrapped up in a bundle of refrigerator cinnamon rolls and baked in a Bundt&reg; or angel food cake pan. Top with dusted powdered sugar or the frosting that comes with the rolls, it looks like you slaved for hours. You can serve it like pull-apart bread but be careful-you may lose the sausage and apple pieces when pulling it apart.",
