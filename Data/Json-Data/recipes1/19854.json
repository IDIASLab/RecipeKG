I already had a jar of sliced jalapenos in the fridge so to be even lazier I just used those and diced them up. The recipe is great as-is but since I always dip my poppers in ranch or blue cheese dressing it is also good with a little of either mixed in. Also this serving size was plenty for my husband and me but for a crowd I would suggest doubling or even tripling the recipe.",

I usually use the Jalape\u00f1o popper spread on here but we don't have mayo so I was looking for one that used sour cream instead. I found this and decided I'd try it. I didn't measure the sour cream or Parmesan so I probably put more than called for but that wasn't a bad thing. I also added a small can of hot green chiles (I only had 3 jalape\u00f1os to use. Oh yeah I used fresh jalape\u00f1os.). I mixed in some parm as well as putting it on top with Panko crumbs (that's what I had on hand). I didn't heat on the stove top but used the oven. I baked it with foil on for 15 mins then took foil off and turned the broiler on for another 5-10. It's delicious! I'll definitely add more jalape\u00f1os next time just because I like it spicy but otherwise this was so yummy!",
