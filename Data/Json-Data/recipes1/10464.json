I didn't have dry mustard on hand, but I substituted a bit of spicy brown, and it worked just fine.  A tip - do NOT overmix the crab meat - it will not turn out the way it's supposed to if you do - it's supposed to be lumpy!  (People who weren't raised in MD tend not to know this, I've found.)  If you can find Old Bay in your supermarket, BUY IT - it makes the difference!  And of course, good Maryland crabmeat, if you can!  Thanks, Bea, this rivals my own recipe!  :-)",

I know this makes it more expensive but it is the difference between great and boring Mrs. Paul's. Also, I like to add some Old Bay seasoning to spice it up. Be gentle when mixing together the ingredients so you don't break up the sweet lumps of crabmeat, you don't want it to be fine like catfood!! I also like to saute my crabcakes in butter in a skillet rather than broil them, but either way this is a delicious and authentic recipe. Yummy.",

(That is unforgivable.)add 1Tablespoon (give or take depending upon your tast). A dash of Worchestershire sauce is also an optional addition. Gently fold all ingredients to gether and then form them into 4 cakes and regdgerate for 30+ minutes before attemping to fry.",

I did not use salt, pepper, or hot sauce.  Instead I used 1 teaspoon of Old Bay Seasoning.  I used two tablespoons of mayonnaise.  I baked them on the center rack for 12 minutes.  They didn't need to go to the top rack at the end for a few extra minutes.  They came out perfectly browned and crispy on the outside and hot and full of flavor on the inside.  I served them with a fresh-made remoulade sauce that I got at my local farmer's market.",
