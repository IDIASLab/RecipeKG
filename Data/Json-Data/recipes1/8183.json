I did use fresh crushed garlic & rubbed it on all sides of our 3.5lb pork tenderloin followed by a light application of salt & pepper before placing it in our crock pot. My advice on the \"sauce\" is to mix the dressing & cranberries BEFORE adding the onion to the mix as the onions make it difficult to thoroughly mix otherwise. Our tenderloin took only 6 hrs on low but was moist and tasty & perfect for a day when you need something easy that you can start & let cook without any tending to. My wife did use \"Wondra\" to thicken the sauce.",

I made it for him and a friend who comes from a family of chefs, and she also loved the flavor and tenderness.  My personal notes:\n-I added 1 tablespoon corn starch to the sauce before putting it in the crock pot.  The sauce came out nice and thick, and I poured the excess over the pork before slicing.  It was excellent.\n-Per everyone's suggestions, I seasoned the pork heavily with salt, pepper, and garlic.  No complaints here.\n-I also used a rolled pork tenderloin, which came out great.\n-If you're looking for a good side dish, mashed sweet potatoes and green beans worked great.  Keep it simple.\n-The only problem was that there really wasn't enough food for four people.  Next time I'll double the recipe.",

I used a bone-in pork loin and I seasoned it with salt/pepper and then seared it in a hot pan with olive oil.  Then put it in the pot with all the ingredients exactly as listed.  It was wonderful!!  I cooked it on high for about 3 1/2 hours and the meat was falling off the bone!! There was lots of sauce, so I made a roux with 3T. butter and 3T. flour and then added all the sauce and it thickened it up.  I sliced the meat and put it on a serving platter with the sauce/gravy poured over the top!!! It was so good!! My hubby had seconds and thirds and my 2 year old asked for MORE!!!! I served it with mashed sweet potatoes and green beans per another reviewers suggestion!! What a pretty dinner!! You could definitely serve it to company.  The only thing that troubled me is that the meat is to tender that it's really hard to cut nice even slices, it pretty much shreds when you go to slice it.  Oh well, it's still awesome!! Thanks for the recipe!!!!",

I seasoned it first with garlic salt and lemon pepper. I used the whole-cranberry sauce and not the jelly type. After eight hours I took it out and took all the meat off amd placed it in a casserole dish and after thickening the sauce poured it over it covered it and placed it in the refrigerator. Tonight I heated it up and served it with homemade mashed potatos fresh asaragus and it was fabulous. We had unexpected guests and they had seconds and thirds. This receipe is a keeper. I think the secret is to let the pork soak up the \"gravy\" for a day. It really had a wonderful flavor.",

I didn't have French dressing so used Western- which is much sweeter. I added some minced garlic & used whole cranberry sauce. Hubby LOVED it as is although next time I plan to use the actual French dressing in the hopes that it will tame down the sweet-factor & some red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch! We've already planned to use this for our pulled pork recipe (using the jellied cranberry sauce). I see us making this often!",
