They're a very satisfying combination of crispy on the outside,  a bit of a chew on the inside, without being at all crumbly. They were delicious and our whole family ate them up! We'll make these on a regular basis. Just a note, though. I did not use ground nuts. I used chopped ones. I missed the \"ground\" part the first few times I made the recipe. Once I noticed, I was too satisfied with the results I'd been getting with chopped nuts that I didn't see the point of going through the extra step of grinding them.",
