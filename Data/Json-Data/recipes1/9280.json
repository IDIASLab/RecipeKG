Changes to the recipe: I used more grapes (about a cupful) and I used French Vanilla pudding instead of plain Vanilla and I added 4 oz. softened cream cheese (yum) and I added about 1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans. I made it the night before so overnight the sauce got a little creamier (it was very thick when I first made it) and it had just a hint of chocolate flavor from sitting overnight in the fridge. It was great when I made it and just as great (but a little different) when we ate it. Definitely a keeper recipe!!",
