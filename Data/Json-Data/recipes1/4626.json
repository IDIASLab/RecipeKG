I will only use 4 ounces of pasta for 2 people next time. I did not mix the clam sauce with the pasta, but rather mixed the pasta with 1tbl spoon of olive oil and put the sauce in the center of the pasta, added some fresh basil and topped it with parmesean cheese. It looks great this way and they loved it! Make sure to use Angel hair pasta for this recipe, anything else is too thick. I have also uploaded a photo I took of the dish I made.",

Even my picky toddlers loved it.  I've never made this kind of pasta before so I wasn't sure what \"White Clam Sauce\" was in the ingredient list.  I went to the jarred pasta sauce section at the grocery store to look for it.  If anyone else is confused, I'm pretty sure the recipe is calling for canned clams in it's juice.  I used Chicken of the Sea's brand of Chopped Clams and poured the whole thing in with the liquid.  It was fabulous.",
