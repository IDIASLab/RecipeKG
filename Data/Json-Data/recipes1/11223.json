My 5 kids thought the recipe okay it varied from \"amazing\" (my 14 yr old boy) to \"mediocre\" (my 7 yr old girl). It kept well in the fridge and I thought it heated up just as good. I only had cream of chicken soup and used butter instead of margarine. I would definitely make this one again. Adding shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top of the bowls is a real flavor booster. Serve this with warm bread!!!",

The creamy texture along with the veggie flavor works well. For the record I made my recipe with the following that I had leftover: instead of a can of asparagus: about 7 stalks of cooked asparagus (from Roasted Asparagus with Balsamic Vinegar from this site); instead of plain chopped carrots: some cooked baby carrots with a brown sugar butter sauce; instead of chicken and rice soup: about 1/2 cup of leftover parmesan rice a roni and a can of Marie Callendar's chicken pot pie soup; instead of chopped potatoes: half a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish of a potato casserole made with potatoes alfredo sauce broccoli onion garlic powder and monterey jack cheese. I also chopped up some extra onion and broccoli. I threw all this into a pot with the spices and chicken broth as recommended and boiled for 10 minutes or so (since the veggies were already cooked). Then I pureed it and poured it back in the pan and added some half and half (I didn't measure it - I just looked for the right consistency - probably about 1-2 cups) and more pepper. I can't believe this puree of leftovers was actually so creamy and tasty! Thanks Micheal.",
