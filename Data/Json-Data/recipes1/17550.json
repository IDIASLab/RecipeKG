The sauce came out really thick but that's probably because I accidentally let it simmer too long. I didn't really measure the lemon juice, but I should have because it was a little sweet and the right amount of lemon would have made it perfect. I also put the shrimp into the pan with the sauce and completely coated them instead of drizzling the sauce. I would definitely make this again.",

I wanted a bold orange flavor so I omitted the lemon juice and replaced it with fresh squeezed orange juice from the orange used for zesting.  That turned out to be a good decision.  It had an amazing fresh orange taste.   Mmmm!  Rather than shake the shrimp in a bag, I hand rolled the shrimp in the cornstarch mixture to ensure a good heavy coating.  I ended up with over 3/4 of the mixture leftover.  If you don't want to be wasteful, I recommend cutting the cornstarch mixture in half.",

I steamed some fresh broccoli in the microwave (florets in a glass container with lid and a few TB of water for about 3 minutes) and served that with the shrimp. It adds a lot to the meal. I've also made it with cut up pieces of chicken thighs since my sister is allergic to shrimp. That was great too!! This is a keeper and I've been asked many times for the recipe.",

He was pleased with how it tasted he enjoyed everything about it! As the person who prepared it I made a couple changes: I used olive oil in place of canola oil (out of sheer laziness it was within arms reach though it definitely has a higher smoke point!). I used regular honey though I read tupelo honey is the standard by which all other honeys are measured so if you can get your hands on some you might have an even tastier dinner.:) I agree with the others who halved the honey mixture (which I zapped in the microwave) and I would definitely increase the cayenne if you want any heat. I d also say you could probably get away with half the cornstarch mixture but since it s pretty cheap I suppose it s better to have an excess than run out and have to make a little more. Yum!
