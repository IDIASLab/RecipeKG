I omit the sugar from the batter, and just add tiny amount of butter (1/4 tsp maybe?) to the syrup and just nuke it rather than the stove top.  I make sure there is plenty of syrup and completely cover the pudding.  Serve it with custard and all you will hear is \"mmmmmm\".  This is also nice with some candied ginger added,or finely diced apple and different nuts.  I think the pecans are the nicest though. Some of the reviewers comment that it is a christmas/special event treat.  We eat this a couple of nights a week in winter, it is wicked. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe, it is so much more healthier than most other sticky date puddings.",

The only alterations I made were leaving out all the sugar in the cake itself (it was sweet anyway with the sugar on the dates and the v. rich sauce) and halving the sauce. It was still very sweet and yummy! Actually quite low-fat due to there being no eggs in it and only a small amount of butter in the sauce (which I halved anyway remember). You would never guess from the finished product the weird ingredient list. Please try this cake without prior predjudice!",
