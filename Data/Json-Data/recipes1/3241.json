I would like to mention that the cooler the meat & eggs are when you begin molding, the easier they are to make. I also like to dip my hands in very cold water before molding each one as my hands are always very warm and the fat in the sausage has a tendency liquify quickly. Definitely dust the eggs with flour before appling the sausage! ",

But I love scotch eggs go figure. Grinding your own meat and spicing it works great. Also I was lacking bread and crumbs at the moment so I substituted with a mixture of Scottish oatmeal oat bran and white corn meal with some Italian seasoning and granulated garlic. Worked wonderfully. The one thing that kept this form being a five star rating is the wastefulness. The first time I made these even though I used less than the recipe called for I still had so much egg flour and meal left over that I added a little milk and baking soda and made drop biscuits. The second time I got along fine with 1/4 cup of flour and 3/4 to 1 cup for the meal/bread crumbs and 2 eggs or 1/4 cup of egg beaters. Remember you can always add more but once the ingredients have come in contact with raw meat and eggs it must be either cooked into something or tossed.",

I followed the recipe for the most part but gleaned tips from some of the reviews: I used Jimmy Dean's sausage, increased to 6 eggs for 2 lbs sausage, used Panko bread crumbs and 2 eggs for dipping was fine. I placed them all in a large oven safe skillet, browned stove top, then put the skillet in the oven for 40 minutes. I served sliced in half on large lettuce \"cups\" with 1/2 cup mayo and 3 Tablespoons Frenches Honey Mustard blended on the side. SO cute! I will use this instead of my breakfast casserole occasionally for company. Also, the night before, I have cooked eggs, encased with sausage and refrigerated. In the morning, dip in egg, bread, brown and bake in the morning. SOOO good with cinnamon rolls and fresh fruit! Different, easy and nice presentation! Sorry for long review and changes but thought it was worth sharing.",

I agree that for up to 6 eggs you only need two beaten eggs for dipping and 2C. total of panko/crumbs. I skipped the flour altogether. Very tasty!! Will do this again!!",
