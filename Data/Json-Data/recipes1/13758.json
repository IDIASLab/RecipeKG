However, I realized last night, that the difference between what I'm eating and what other raters might be eating is that I am using smokey cheddar cheese.  That with a little salt and pepper is just fantastic.  I also am using fresh broccoli.  My fiance likes softer veggies so I steamed his broccoli and onions before baking since I like things a bit crunchier.  Didn't matter, it was all soft last night.  Another difference, though, and the one I attribute the softer broccoli and onions to, is that I doubled the bisquit mix, milk and eggs.  It was a perfect amount of pie.  Next time, I am going to double all but add a tad more baking mix (instead of 1/2 cup I'll use 1 1/2 cups) than I used last night and then I think it will be right where I want it.  This is definitely a good recipe to start with, though, in my opinion.  We both have loved it each time it's been made.",
