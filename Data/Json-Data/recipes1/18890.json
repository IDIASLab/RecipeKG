A conglom of several recipes, it's great with coffee, not too sweet, not too bready, with a rich, tender crumb and the traditional lemon/nutmeg flavors of a genuine NOLA king cake. Best eaten same day but pretty darn good the day after (if there are leftovers!). Enjoy, y'all!",

The dough is less eggy than some traditional king cakes and has the pleasant tang of buttermilk and the cream cheese filling is the bomb. It's a king cake to convert the king-cake averse because it's both moist and not-too-sweet. I had to use 1 cup additional flour to get the dough to leave the sides of the bowl but it rose beautifully. (My trick for proofing dough: A hot-water bath in a very low oven. Put the dough in a buttered medium ceramic bowl that you've warmed with hot water and dried wrap it with plastic and then nest it in a large ceramic bowl with a little hot water. Set the whole thing in your oven and turn the oven to 110 degrees. In two hours you'll have doubled dough.) I also added some vanilla bean paste and extra lemon juice to the icing to boost the flavor.",

The \"filling\" nearly absorbs into the cake as it bakes, giving it a soft and flavorful but not runny center.\n\nAlso, nutmeg and lemon *were* the traditional NOLA King Cake flavorings (anyone remember McKenzie's? :); what we've had for decades now is a cinnamon substitution - basically, a cinnamon coffee cake with colored sugar. *meh*\n\nThanks for your comments, everyone! :)",

I'm a very experienced baker so this seemed easy enough. I made the dough as directed however I didn't roll it out on parchment; it rolled easily on the counter and I just transferred it to the baking sheet as I would a traditional yeast coffeecake ring. It baked for the 45 minutes but I still thought it was a bit \"doughy\" even though the exterior was a nice medium golden brown. Also the recipe advises to use a 8\" round pan to mold the ring around. That didn't work for me because I was using a traditional 1/2 sheet pan so there wasn't room along the edges for the dough to fit so I used a bowl that was about 7\". We did not like the filling. All you can taste is the tartness of the cream cheese. We prefer the traditional cinnamon version of King Cake. No one in my family was familiar with the lemon/nutmeg flavoring. I wanted to like it but it just didn't do it for me.",

The flavors are much more subtle and evocative of the king cakes from the 50s. Only change I've made it adding a few tablespoons to lowfat buttermilk since I can't find the kind called for. I can't get enough of this cake!",

Loved the way the filling melted into the surrounding. Will remake as a sweet breakfast bread. (Easy to add sugar to inside and save time not dealing with frosting.)",
