The true test was when even the \"meat only\" and the \"I don't eat burgers\" girls ate them and declared, \"Hey, these are good!!!\"  I've tried several fast food and packaged \"Veggie Burgers\" and found them to be either too spicy or have too much filler.  I read some of the reviews first so I wasn't surprised to find the mixture somewhat sticky.  This could be because some of the 1 1/2 cups of flour should have been included in the mixture since there is far too much of it to simply dip 8 patties in, 1/2 a cup of flour is plenty for that purpose.  I sprinkled about 3/4 of a cup of flour into the mixture which removed the stickiness.  I used only zucchini since summer squash was unavailable the first time and way too expensive when it was available.  A little grated red pepper added some \"great\" colour and flavour.  These will be an added favourite to \"Burger Night\".",

I sauted the vegetables in iron skillet for added vitamins. I sauted until the vegetables were free of any liquid. The reviews are right only 1/3 Cup of flour was necessary for dipping patties in after forming them. I pressed them in a hamburg press for uniformity. Because I knew that I would use a George Forman grill I added about 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke to mixture. They were just the best veggie burgers that I have ever made. I am anxious to substitute brocolli for some of the squash. I hope you enjoy your burger as much as we have.",

I don't follow exact measurements, just add whatever I have on hand (sometimes no summer squash, just carrot & zucchini) and until the mixture forms nice patties.  To those of you who's patties are sticky, add more oats; to those who have dry patties, add more veggies.  Use common sense - add more or less of whatever you like, and get the consistency right by varying amounts of wet vs dry ingredients.  I bread with breadcrumbs instead of flour.  I also usually add nutritional yeast & breadcrumbs and sometimes add ground flax & wheat germ to the mixture (can't taste it or tell the difference without, so why not add some additional nutrition?).

Had no problem with excess moisture or crumbling or falling apart. I mixed everything in my food proccessor. I placed my hands in the flour first before handling the mixture to make patties - really helped no stickiness. The burgers tasted bland to me even though I used a lot of garlic and Italian seasoning. But I love spicy food so it's no wonder to me that they tasted bland. Think I'll try mixing in some ketchup or a little tomato sauce next time to give them more flavor. I like these! Will definitely make them again.",

I was happy with the texture of these as they were not mushy like bean burgers which I also like. My finished burgers ended up lacking in flavor but it may be a result of my adjustments to get patties to form. So my review is mostly based on texture results. I had issues with the the mixture forming patties so I added another egg then added flour then I felt like it still needed something else and added more oats. For veggies I used a green bell pepper and the called for onions and carrots. I threw in some crushed walnuts and used a little feta cheese instead of cheddar. I'm going to have to tweak this to infuse some kind of flavor but I am thrilled about the texture. Even when I was ready to form patties with the mix out of the fridge they almost seemed like they might fall apart. I dredged them in flour on all sides and cooked them on the cast iron skillet and nothing fell apart. Because of the lack of flavor issue and depending on your modifications I would recommend that you test fry a single patty and then do a taste test. It doesn't take long to fry and you'll have the chance to adjust the seasoning if needed.",
