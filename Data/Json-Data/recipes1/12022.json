I goofed a little in not having the pan quite hot enf to sear -- I nearly cooked the fish in this step! I had also changed a little by using some olive oil in the pan because fridge temperature fish dipped in melted butter just caused butter globs on the first piece and nothing for the rest. I sprinkled the mixed spices onto each piece with clean fingers...tidier that way. We had it with ratatouille and a bottle of zinfindel. Killer good! I will do again and after searing just simmer in a little of the dressing instead of baking which IMO is an unnecessary drying out step.",

Didn't have lemon pepper so added extra teaspoon black pepper. Used 1/2 teaspoon of \"fake\" salt. Sprayed on olive oil instead of butter.\r\n\r\nMade Good Seasons Italian dressing. Dressing called for 1/4 cup white wine vinegar. I put 3 tablespoons of raspberry blush balsamic vinegar and filled rest of 1/4 cup with balsamic vinegar. The balsamic vinegar gives is a subtle sweetness. (um, not very Cajun, but tasty!)\r\n\r\nMy wife said that, \"it is a restaurant grade dish\". I don't know about all of that, but it was very tasty and I appreciated her compliment!",
