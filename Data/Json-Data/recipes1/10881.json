It gave it a bite (but one my 2 year old could handle) and the sauce toned down the jalepeno.  The sauce is pretty thick but still good.  We had it over white rice.  I only had 3/4 cup of pineapple juice, so I added apple juice to make it the right amount.",

If I ever make it again I think i'd use less cornstarch and just make it thicker by heating it longer... Did not have any green onions at the time, so used half a small white onion. I added frozen brocolli and green peas, and served this over brown and wild rice cooked with veggie broth. I also used a stone ground dijon mustard.  Was a good sweet flavor and the lover of ham and pineapple (separately) in the house loved it :)",
