When I tried to used mixes from different companies it did not work. When I compared the ingredients the BC mix has egg whites in it and the others did not so that may be the reason. My mom made this type of divinity when I was growing up and I know it came from a Betty Crocker cookbook! In San Diego I found the mix at Albertson's and Stater Brothers markets. Contact General Mills customer service to find out if any stores in your area carry it - they gave me a list of six!",

I could not get the frosting mix boiling water & corn syrup to whip up into anything but runny sweet syrup. I added the confectioners sugar and continued beating. Nothing. I finally put the entire concoction in the microwave to try to boil it hoping that it probably needed some additional heat. I then continued beating. It finally beat into something so hard that I had a hard time getting it out of the bowl and into a container. I ended up rolling the final concoction into small little balls. I feel this was a waste of ingredients including the frosting mix 4 cups of confectioners sugar and 1 cup of chopping pecans! Has anyone else had problems with this recipe????",

I never measured it I used it as it was needed so I just poured until I felt it was right. But the recipe was on the frosting box. It was Betty Crocker and it said after dropping it on the cookie sheets one needs to bake it at 325 for 5 minutes. I did this and it set the candy up immediately. For one that has never been able to make divinity no matter what I tried I was estatic with glee that I finally made divinity that I did not have run all over the place....I will definitly use this recipe again and the neighbors were thrilled too!
