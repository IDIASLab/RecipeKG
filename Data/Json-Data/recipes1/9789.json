I used the recipe exactly as written except I rolled the prebaked cookie in granulated sugar because I read the other reviews which stated they were not sweet.  My mother and her Italian friends did this with their nut rolls.  I think this made them perfect.  it does make a lot, but they freeze very well and you always have something you can pull out of the freezer when you get unexpected company.",

They look very pretty and inviting but the problem is it's a nut filling rolled in bread. The description and ingredients fool you into thinking this is some kind of pastry but it has the exact texture and taste of bread. Dividing the dough (1/2 recipe) into 8 portions will make 128 rolls which overflows 2 aluminum pie plates. I baked on a baking stone so the bottoms don't get so browned. Edit NO ONE like them. NO ONE! Maybe they can be fixed with a drizzle of caramel icing on top...because there's still a huge amount left in my freezer. The idea was good but I won't be making these again unless the carmel icing idea goes over. I might use the nut filling somewhere else. Sorry!",
