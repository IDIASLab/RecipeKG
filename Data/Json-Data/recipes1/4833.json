                "reviewBody": "Very Nice! A simple basic chicken noodle stir fry, i cooked it for myself (1 serving) for lunch and it went down a treat. I think that with these adaptions, this would be perfect:  1. Use more oil, otherwise there is not enough oil to cook the chicken and vegetables properly  2. At stage 2, you should cook the vegetables for 5 minutes- not 2.! At 2 minutes, the onions and broccoli are still basically raw! You also do not have to cover the skillet/wok. If you use enough oil, and stir fry properly- you will get cooked, and flavourful meat and veg.  3. You can't add the noodles completely dried- They should be cooked or if using thin noodles- at least soaked. Otherwise the noodles will not cook correctly. You should add the partially cooked noodles, a little bit of water, DOUBLE the teriyaki sauce and stir fry for 2 more minutes, and then the dish is ready.  Some advice there. This is a lovely recipe enjoy!!!",

The person who complained about this being spicy must have had a high salt teriyaki--there isn't any flavor of salt in the recipe itself. What is missing is specific indication of what kind of \"Chinese Noodles\" to use. Ramen is NOT in my opinion a good choice! I used 1/2 rice vermicelli & 1/2 bean vermicelli asian noodles--soaked briefly to soften & then let the steam cook them to clear. Also cut chix to long strips first (best for family). VERY GOOD!",
