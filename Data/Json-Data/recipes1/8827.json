After tasting the sausage and commenting to my husband how good it was, he informed me he added beer to the skillet after he browned the meat. We cooked the sausage in a pan with chopped onions, browned,  then added 1/4 cup beer.  The second time we made it we used alittle less brown sugar, much better, not so sweet. Really Good....",
