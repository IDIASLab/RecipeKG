I ALWAYS simmer my sausage (kielbasa) for at least a good 30 -40 minutes in water and this takes most of the grease away.  The stock can be used to make split pea soup or any vegetable soup.  Actually I use the stock in cooking my kraut - gives the kraut a bit of a smoky flavor.",

This was pretty good however I added a few changes of my own. In addition to the pepper, I had green I added a small onion, a few baby carrots and one stalk of celery. I was trying to use up some left over vegetables. I cut everything the same size, all diced. I cooked all the veggies together in just a dash of oil. In a bigger frying pan I cooked the potatoes in a little bit of oil and butter to crisp them up a bit then I added the kielbasa. When the potatoes were almost tender I added the lightly sauteed veggies to the pan. I also added a little bit of beef broth to keep it moist and a few dashes of soy sauce. Put the lid on it and let it cook just a tad more to fully cook the potatoes. The only downfall is there just wasn't enough for 3 hungry adults and 1 child. Next time I will make even more.",

Add olive oil, salt & pepper and roast it in the oven for 45 minutes or so. I occasionally add slivers of garlic and/or mushrooms. Really yummy...",

However, I personally coat the potatoes and peppers with olive oil & toss them with some McCormick Montreal Seasoning, a dash of garlic powder and salt.  Put the potatoes (I cut the potatoes into bite size chunks rather than dicing them) on a baking sheet and bake for about 10 minutes @ 375.  Then put the peppers and add some onion on the sheet right after I move the potatoes around, wait another 5 minutes or so and just put the kielbasa on top and cook for another 10 minutes. Doing it in the oven keeps you from having to stand at the stove top for the whole time. Comes out delish!  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe!",

After reading reviews here I was afraid of mushy potatos so we were careful not to stir the food any more than necessary during cooking. A couple of pan shakes and fliping the food around during cooking was all it needed. Was not greasy and the taters were just perfect. It did stick to the pan as other reviews stated but some Dawn Power Dissolve will make cleaning it a snap. We will make this again since it's an easy week night recipe.",
