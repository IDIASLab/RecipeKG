Read it through, though -- she's got two pots going, and the second pot needs to be started before the first pot if they're going to finish together.  Which also brings me to the fact it's kind of a bummer that you have to dirty two pots and take up two burners.  It seems like it ought to be possible to do it all in one pot. For instance, if you precooked the wild rice for 20 minutes, then drained it and started the butter, white rice, onion, carrot, and raisins in the same pot, then added the wild rice back in with the broth, wouldn't that work?  You could increase the broth a bit to make up for a little more cooking for the wild rice.",

I also followed another reader's advise and toasted the cashew's as well and this was an outstanding dish. I made the sweet pork chops (on this site) with it and used the sauce from that over this rice dish. My husband can't wait for me to make it again. I still have leftovers of the rice!",

Add the other rice and liquid (even brown rice) and cook until done. Oh I'd also use olive oil before margarine (healthier...). Other than that loved the recipe!",
