The rootbeer flavor was still pretty mild but delicious non-the-less! Also, instead of poking holes, I removed the cake from the bundt pan, poured the glaze inside and replaced the cake into the cake pan. This allowed the cake to soak up the glaze. Let it sit for a few minutes and flip back out and viola! A pretty cake that also is very tasty. The vanilla ice cream is a great touch. This recipe is soooo easy- my daughter almost made it by herself (she's sooo proud). Thanks for the unique but great recipe Karin!",

I subsituted the regular rootbeer with a good name brand diet one and used a sugar subsitute in the glaze part. This lowered the sugar and didn't hurt the taste in any way. This has been one of the best recipes we've tried! Thanks to Karin for passing it along.",

I also take the cake out of the pan pour some of the glaze in the pan put the cake back then I poke the bottom and pour the rest of the glaze on. I noticed a lot o reviews said it wasnt rootbeer\"y\" enough so I added a tsp rootbeer flavoring to the cake batter and to the glaze. Yummmmmmm.",
