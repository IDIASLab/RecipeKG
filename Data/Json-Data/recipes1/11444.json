I sliced the loaf (1/2 loaf of Italian Herb Bread I from this site) in half lengthwise, like splitting a roll.  I spread the butter mixture on both sides, then put them together and baked, at 350 in foil for 20 minutes.  Then I added the cheese and baked the bread open-faced until the cheese melted.  Served with Chicken Milano from this site.  I used fresh oregano.  Very good- I usually make my own garlic bread but this recipe is great.  I love the olive oil addition- I had never thought of that before!",

I loved the combination of both olive oil and butter. I used a little less oregano than called for but it, too, was a nice addition. I also added some finely chopped parsley which gave it some freshness and color. Still, I think I must stress that this will only be as good as the quality of the bread you use.",

I made a whole loaf of Italian Bread to go along with Greek Penne and Chicken and almost the whole loaf went with our small family. Next time I might try adding a little parmesan cheese to the bread over the garlic butter just family preference but it is definitely not needed. Thank you for sharing this is definitely a keeper!!",

A word to the wise; as is, you will not have enough spread to brush a full Italian loaf of bread.  If you wish to brush the entire loaf, better double the spread.  I had nice compliments on this.  The broil times advised in the recipe were accurate, though my rack is several notches away from the broiler element, which I think worked well.",

You'd still use the three cloves like the recipe specifies. To learn hwo to roast garlic go to http://appetizer.allrecipes.com/az/roastedgarlic.asp. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",
