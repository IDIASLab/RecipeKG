Then follow the directions from there. I didn't have 2 boxes of vanilla pudding (& not going back to the store on Thanksgiving!!) so I used 1 box of vanilla & 1 box of chocolate pudding. WOW!!!!!:o) I also used my own whipped cream with coconut flavoring and about 1/3 c. of coconut flakes mixed in.:o)",
