I did cut down the butter to 1/2 cup and increased the pumpkin to 1 cup as recommended by some of the other reviewers. I also increased the pumpkin pie spice by about 1/4 of a teaspoon and added another 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. I used a candy thermometer but did stop stirring before the 234 degree mark because my arm was getting tired!! (I think I was at about 228.)I also used the white chocolate chips --2cups--verses the butterscotch morsels. I added these 1/3 of a bag at a time to minimize the chance that the mixture would seize and turn to sugar. My fudge turned out very smooth and creamy. This fudge has a nice taste and creamy texture and is a wonderful flavor for the fall season. It is VERY sweet so small pieces are plenty. My family and I will be making this one again!!!",

After absorbing the moisture of the fudge the rice krispies added a texture not unlike coconut but it was still nice. I used 1/2 cup butter to insure that the fudge set-up and was happy with the drop in fat. I used 1 whole cup of canned pumpkin which really added to the overall pumpkin flavor. I omitted the butterscotch chips altogether (nobody seemed to like them so I just did it) and used 1 1/2 cups white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup cinnamon chips. The fudge ultimately came out tasting a lot like pumpkin pie without the awful consistency. I did not have a candy thermometer so the first time I made this it came out the consistency of granola or small grain gravel. It wasn't until later that I realized that you have to boil it over medium (not high) heat. The 2nd time around after that adjustment the fudge turned out great. I boiled over medium-high heat (\"7\") for 11 minutes (just to be safe) and had no problems. Enjoy!",
