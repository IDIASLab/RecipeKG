Then take it out top with some fresh mozz. and then back in the oven for the required cook time written on the package. While it's baking you toss some arugula with some balsamic dressing and shaved parmigiano reggiano and when the pizza comes out of the oven you top with this salad. Let it sit for a minute or two and the hot cheese helps the salad stick. Boom instant fantastic pizza and also good with a little prosciutto added with the salad (not baked.)",

If you go that route make sure to use thick crust so it gives the salad a chance to dry out a bit while baking and boom veggie pizza. I think that's what I'll do next time. /as for this time I didn't realize that you don't bake the pizza but simply have the crust ready. Having used a thin crust the dressing didn't let it crisp up too well. Meh it was eaten. I used sausage instead of chicken strips.",
