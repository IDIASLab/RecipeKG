I can play around with the level of \"heat\" by mixing hot or medium taco sauce or by adding green chiles.  I also use the chopped lettuce as a border so that dipping is easier.  Great dip!",

It tastes great!!\n\nThe third time I made this I halfed the ground beef to 1 lb, it's good either way, but with 1 lb, you definitely taste the cream cheese/sour cream mixture more.  Better at room temperature.  Next time I might prepare the cream cheese mixture ahead and spread it into the dish, cover with foil and store in fridge overnight before putting everything else on it because the mixture is much more flavorful the next day.",

                "reviewBody": "This is sooooooo good however I changed a couple of the ingredients. First I used 1lb of gr. turkey because the I thought the gr. beef flavor might be to much. I mixed the cooked gr. turkey with a can of refried beans and the taco sauce. This I added to the bottom of the bowl. Instead of regular cream cheese I used whipped cream cheese because it is easier to mix with the sour cream. The cream cheese/sour cream/taco seasoning mixture I added on top of the meat and bean mixture. Next I added a bunch of shredded chedder cheese I got rid of the lettuce ( I was afraid it might wilt) added the chopped tomatoes onions and olives. Make sure you add a big spoon to the bowl at your buffet or party because this dip is thick and your chips will break if you just try to scoop it out of the bowl. This dip made this way is super yummy every one who has tasted it just loves it. You won't regret making this dip.;o) Elise P.S Serve this dip cold. After you make it put it in the fridge and take it out when company comes or you leave to go to where ever you will be taking the dip.",

Is this suppossed to be served while the meat is still warm right after the dish is put together or when the dish is cold? I choose cold (like other 7-layer taco dips I've made before) and it was terrible. Afterall do YOU like eating cold hamburger? How about 2 lbs of it? It almost made me choke! You can hardly taste anything else! I then tried to heat it up a few min in the microwave and then the lettuce and cream cheese gets wilted and all melty (I know that's not a word...). Even my boyfriend who eats almost anything...stuck his nose up at this. Nothing personal Bumblebee but I will never make this again.",

I added a layer of guacomole over the sour cream/cream cheese layer. I left out the lettuce. I\nused olives sparingly as I find many people don't like them in this kind of dip. Another thing, this recipe makes a huge quantity. I used a pie plate. If you use as directed with the 2 lbs of meat, you will definitely need a bigger boat, as in a 13 x 9 inch dish. Also, you need a spoon and small plates for serving.  You cannot \"dip\" chips into it.\nHaving said all that, it was very good and I will make again for parties.",
