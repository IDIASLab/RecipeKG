Then, I read the reviews about 8oz. of sour cream (that's a BIG difference allrecipes' editors!) and suggestion of using 2 eggs.  Ummm . . . OK this is what I came up with: 2 eggs, 8oz. sour cream, slightly less than 1/2cup oil, one 15oz. can of creamed-style corn, 2 cups self-rising (white) corn meal, + 2 Tblsp.sugar.  Mix all ingredients together & pour into greased glass 9\" x 9\" dish and bake at 425 for 40-45 minutes.  A smooth, cakey-textured cornbread that HOLDS together!  (the hotter oven temp. helps \"crisp\" the edges/sides of this cornbread, making the pieces cut from the edges of the pan preferred!)  Yum!",
