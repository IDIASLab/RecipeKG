I doubled the flour mixture and barely had enough of the bread crumb mixture to cover the chicken. After baking, we tossed these in a mixture of 1 stick of melted butter and 1 cup of hot sauce, simmered together. These were spicy hot and outstanding! My 13 year old son remarked that he no longer needed to go to the local Ruby Tuesday's restaurant for their buffalo chicken tenders - that he would prefer to make ours! Thanks for a recipe that was fun for my son and I to make together and is not fried and more economical than eating out!",

However, with some of the additions suggested by some of the reviewers, it is definitely a five-star (plus) recipe!!  I used Frank's instead of water in the egg mix.  When everything was cooked, I tossed the chicken fingers in a sauce made of 1/4 c melted Smart Balance Light margarine and 1/2 c Frank's Red Hot Sauce.  I also used panko bread crumbs (my first time cooking with them - I loved them!!  they made the chicken fingers so crunchy! -- and they looked fried after they were all covered with sauce...tricks the brain :).  These were AMAZING and I will definitely make anytime I get a craving!  (By the way, with my additions, this is still only 3 g fat and 97 calories per serving.)  UPDATE:  I brought into work today and have already gotten several requests for the recipe -- even the non-dieters love them!",

First, I use chicken tenderloins, just so I don't have to cut the chicken breasts.  Second, I melt 2 parts butter and 4 parts Frank's hot sauce.  I like my sauce hot, so use more butter if you want a less fiery sauce.  I dip the tenderloins in the buffalo sauce when they have about 1 minute of cooking left.  After they have been dipped, they go back in the oven for the last minute of cooking.  I then serve them on a bun for a lower fat buffalo chicken sandwich.",
