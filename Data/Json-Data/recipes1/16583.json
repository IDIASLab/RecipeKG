I followed the recipe as instructed, using frozen peas and carrots instead of canned, and I didn't have the Kikkoman sauce so I used a generous amount of curry powder and a little coriander, seasoned to taste. It tasted just like an authentic samosa and was very simple to make but dry without the sauce...so I went and bought the sauce. I mixed a tsp in with the filling just to test it and I hate it. I bought tamarind pulp and made my own tamarind sauce and that helped a lot. I am going to try adding some vegetable broth to moisten the mixture as well. I will make this recipe again but definitely not with the kikkoman sauce.",
