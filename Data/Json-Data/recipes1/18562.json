To help you decide how much pepper to use, use the full amount of ancho chili pepper.  Ancho chili pepper only adds depth of flavor not heat.  I did cut in half the chipotle chili pepper (that is where the heat is.  I used the full amount of cayenne.  I added a diced red pepper as I saut\u00e9ed the onion. When you add the beans also add 2 cups of white frozen corn. For the garnish also use broken lime tortilla chips.  I promise, doing it this way will not be too spicy hot but just wonderful.",

I am glad I listened to my common sense. I usually like spicy food but wish I had reduced the peppers even more. If you want to try this recipe start with 1/4 the amount of ground peppers it calls for and then add more if you like. I wonder if all the rave reviews came from people who do not have these particular spices in their cabinet so they substituted a milder chili powder.",

I made a few changes--I didn't have chipotle or ancho chile powder on hand so I used a generic chili powder blend and threw a couple adobo chipotle peppers in with the spices deseeded and chopped. I added a little cinnamon and just a dash of cloves because I think they play with the other flavors well and add a hint of complexity. This is a keeper. It's quick it's cheap it's delicious and if you have a 3 quart skillet it only uses one pan. A perfect dinner to spice up the middle of the week. No pun intended honestly.",

I followed the rest of the recipe as written. Oops A little more cayenne pepper! Lots of cilantro for garnish. It was fabulous! Everyone loved it. It took a long time to make but was worth it.

Turns out even that was way too much and hubby agreed. I trust his judgement when he says it s overkill. The saving grace for this recipe is the toppings. The sour cream cools it down and the fresh cilantro and green onions gives it much needed flavor. Suffice to say we did not skimp with the toppings!",
