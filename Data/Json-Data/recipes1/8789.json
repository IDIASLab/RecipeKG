Only 1-1 1/2lbs. nuts and 1/2 cup milk in the nuts instead of butter and 1 cup sugar and 1 egg. Brush with butter and let rise. This makes 4 large rolls. Bake at 350 for 30-35 min. this dough can even be a little sticky. I hopeyou will try these adjustments. I grew up with this bread at holidays and now my son loves it too!",
