The brown sugar gives them a very nice flavor. Twelve minutes in the oven was not enough for ours though -- they needed 18-20. We kept checking them and took them out just when the edges started to be very light brown. The recipe turns out a nice big batch. Oh and you don't have to bother to flatten them on the cookie sheet -- you can just drop them on in globs and they'll spread themselves out to just the right thickness. We'll be making these again and again!",

I have added ground hazlenuts in one batch ground walnuts and maple flavoring in another (used 1tbsp maple and 1tbsp vanilla) added the zest of one whole orange and a little of the juice in the last batch (use less butter) and today I am doing one batch with oatmeal added another with cocoa powder to make chocolate cookies and another with spices and maple flavoring instead of vanilla (I ran out of vanilla). This is perfect to play with and make your own. THANKS ROBIN!!!",

I did have to tinker with the time and temperature a bit but I think thats because my oven insulation was pulled off by my son. I find that the dough is very easy to work with. No need to refrigerate just so I can form the cookies. The recipe is just as described in the subtitle. I am definitely an impatient baker! You can enjoy your cookies soon after throwing the ingredients together. Also the dough doesn't stick to my hands and I've made them in warm and cold weather. Thanks alot. Definitely a keeper!",
