After the beef was browned I sauteed a small bag of fresh baby spinach in garlic and olive oil and added it to the layers. I also added the House Seasoning to the cottage cheese mixture and used bottled pasta sauce instead of the other. My picky 5 yr old daughter actually asked for \"MORE MASAGNA\"! It was flavorful and I was able to sneak some green in for my picky eater! Will definately make this again!:)",

I did add some basil & oregano to taste and mozzarella cheese melted on top. I also used twice the amount of tomato sauce. I know - sounds like a lot of changes but isn't that why we read the reviews and rate the recipes. I get a lot of good ideas from the comments. Hope this helps. Very easy and good recipe!!",

It was quick and easy and sooo delicious!  The only thing I did differently was to use 1 lb. of hamburger and 1/2 lb. sausage, and I added the tomato sauce mixture to the meat mixture with 1 tsp. of italian seasoning and let it simmer for a few minutes.  I also added a little parmesan to the cottage cheese mixture and covered the top with mozzarella.  It was GREAT!",
