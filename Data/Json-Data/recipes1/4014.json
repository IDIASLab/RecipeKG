The second time I made this, I added 1/2 cup thinly sliced red onion to the peppers, and it made a difference in the flavor!  Timesaver tip:  add the broccoli to the boiling pasta for 3-4 minutes, then scoop out and add to the red peppers.  Thanks for the recipe!",

Also a teaspoon and a half of salt\n\nStrongly considered adding some red pepper flakes or salsa, but were afraid to push the envelope too much...\n\nInstead of linguini, we used penne pasta, and it turned out as good as any Whole Foods pasta salad, delicious warm and room temperature.",

Others have stated to increase the oil/butter to equally spread over the lb of noodles which is what I did but I would think that 1/2 cup of chicken broth or white wine would have been a much better option.
