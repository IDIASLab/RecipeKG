The rub is good and makes a nice bark but they are more sweet forward than we prefer. With that being said, I highly recommend a Kansas City style bbq sauce that is more tomato/vinegar based rather than a sweet bbq sauce. Unless you prefer sweeter tasting smoked ribs that is, then slather them up with a sweet bbq sauce. Good rub and nice bark but I would reduce the brown sugar next time for our taste.",
