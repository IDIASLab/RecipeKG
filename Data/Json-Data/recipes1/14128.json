I also added an additional tsp of Worcestershire sauce and when they were all done, melted some additional blue cheese crumbles on top.  My family (including 2 really picky son-in-laws and one realll picky daughter)all LOVED them. They are definitaly going to be on the menu again and again here.  I also recommend you use an 80/20 ground beef.  You do need some fat in these for flavor. Try them....if you like the tang of blue cheese, you will love these and if you aren't worried about the calories...go for the bacon addition!",
