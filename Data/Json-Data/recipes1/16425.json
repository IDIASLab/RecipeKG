From a presentation point of view the pear slices looked a little dry when this came out of the oven. Next time I think I'll try heating a little bit of apple jelly and brushing it on the fruit before it goes into the oven. For whatever reason the crust ended up tough/too chewy...I used a Boboli thin pizza crust. In the future I think I'll use my own homemade pizza crust. This is very rich the vinaigrette has a wonderful herb-garlic-blue cheese flavor and it was dinner last night with a big tossed salad. IMO this is best served warm. Thanks M.J.W. for a new recipe that definitely is \"outside the box.\"",

The sauce loses a little bit of flavor once cooked, but you can always add a little more once the pizza is cooked. Mmmmm.",
