The seasonings for this recipe are good and proportionate, and for a meatless sauce, it is outstanding. I did not use any oil.  I chop and add veggies to the pot as is. I blanched and peeled the tomatoes, though, and left them chunky.  Also, I added a lot of green peppers, onions, and fresh mushrooms to make it stocky, and I added more tomato paste because I like the sauce thick.  This is as good a basic recipe as I've tried.

I did cook on low for about 6 hours.  I omitted the bell pepper b/c my family doesn't like them.  I added extra garlic (b/c we love garlic, I roasted it first and used the whole head) and some red pepper flakes.  I used my Braun hand mixer to puree the sauce.  I used the whole can of tomato paste.  It is a very good sauce.  Tastes like a basic sauce, but better than the jarred stuff.  I froze in 3 ziplock freezer bags for later.  ********Update:  I made this again. Just a week later.  This time I used the full 16 cups of tomatoes.  Well a little over.  I bought over 5 lbs of plum tomatoes.  I still left out the bell pepper, and added about 3/4 tsp red pepper flakes, 2 bay leaves, and 2 heads roasted garlic (drizzle with olive oil and cook 35 min. in 400 degree oven, squeeze out garlic). I followed the rest of the ingredients exactly.  I left it on low in the crockpot for 8 hours.  When I came home it smelled like an italian resturant.  I removed the bay leaves and pureed the sauce with my Braun hand mixer to make it smooth adn added 1 can of tomato paste.  It made about 3 1/2 quarts.  I plan on freezing it.  My last batch is gone already.  It was excellent!  I made spagetti and meatballs and eggplant lasagna with the sauce last time.",

Served it to my ITALIAN father-in-law and he declared it \"Great\" - he said his mother used to make a sauce like it many years ago.  Some of us topped it with feta cheese, and some of us topped it with shredded parmesean (instead of grated).  Thanks very much for the recipe Stephanie- it's a keeper!",
