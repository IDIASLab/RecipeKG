I use a \"Misto\"(TM) filled with olive oil. Also, you can decrease the salt and add additional seasonings. Enjoy!!  UPDATE: The timing of the baking, as others noted, is critical. Baking too little results in limp kale pieces and baking too long causes a \"burned\" taste. Be sure to use the \"curly\" kale variety as it tend to be less bitter.DO NOT EXPECT them to taste like potato chips... that was just an expression I used in the description. Kale is a nutritional powerhouse and rich in calcium and other vitamins. GREAT way to feed yourself and your kids!! ENJOY!!",

                "reviewBody": "I've tried a LOTS of versions of kale chips with LOTS of different results. I've found that the success of the chip depends on three things: how you cook them, how curly the kale is and how much oil you use.   This method has been, by far, the best: I've tried lower temp with long cooking, higher temp with quick cooking, convection methods, different sheet pans and all the rest. This recipe works (IMHO) by using a non insulated sheet and cooking at 350 for 10 minutes. I rotated my baking sheet 180 halfway through.   I also made a point to use ONLY just enough oil to BARELY coat the leaves otherwise they'll stay soggy. When I arrange the pieces on the pan, I place them like little upside down \"V's\" so the curly side is down: I think this helps the air circulate around them better.   Other than that, after you coat them with the oil, get creative with the toppings!!! I squeeze a little lemon on mine with sea salt or will do some garlic powder with chipotle pepper powder.   Hope you'll all enjoy these as much as I did...Thanks Lucy!",

Good.\n\nI've been looking to an alternative to munching chips in front of the TV at night, and these are awesome, especially when you've had enough hummus for the week:). \n\nFor those who were concerned about the ultra-crunchy crumbliness, (which in truth I kind of liked) I found that those Kale leaves that were folded in two (as it tends to do by itself if you don't unfold it as you place it on the pan) were a little more crunchy on parts and chewier in parts, if that's what you're going for. I had a mix of both and loved it. \n\nI kept a close eye on these and ended up happier with a tad lower temperature (around 330-340) and set the timer for 6 minutes and checked them, the first batch ready in 7 min, the second in 6 (hotter oven I guess). \n\nHalfway through eating these, I called my sister in law and HAD to tell her about them. Definitely a find. I will make these at my next family gathering. (My nephews and nieces have come to expect my unusual 'hippie' food:) )",
