I put my sliced almonds in the blender to grind them and it worked great; the only thing is that my cookie dough was so soft there was no way I could form balls. Dropping the dough by teaspoonfuls onto parchment covered cookie sheets worked very well; since I did not want to roll them in extra sugar anyway. BIG HINT: do not remove the cookies from the parchment paper until they are cool; if not they fall apart! Connie thank you for sharing!",

A couple tablespoons of Amaretto did the trick. Firm on the outside soft on the inside and loads of flavor. I will definitely be making these again.",

In fact I can't figure out where the name of this recipe came from but who cares they are good anyway. I left half of the ground almonds less than fine and we enjoyed the chewy result. The directions of the recipe seem to leave out what to do with the cup of chopped almonds or is it me? Also it yields about 50 cookies so keep your eye on quantity. Thanks for your recipe Connie.",
