I used half frozen and half fresh rhubarb, resulting in 4 cups of fruit, and I didn't experience any of the problems mentioned (flat pie, spillover) by previous reviewers.  I pre-baked the shell for 15 mins to prevent sogginess.  I cut the scraps into shapes for a loose top, and sprinkled cinnamon-sugar over the whole thing. The egg mixture mellowed the rhubarb, yet intensified the fruity tartness.  Great!",
