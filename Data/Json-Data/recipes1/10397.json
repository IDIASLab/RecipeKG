I made a full batch and used only 1/2 c. of chicken broth instead of 3/4 and it turned out perfect. I used the same amount of cayenne as the recipe called for because I can handle spice, but for those who are sensitive I suggest cutting the spice in half or less. I doubled the garlic, added some chopped onions in while sauteeing the peppers, and a couple pinches of dried oregano and basil and it turned out AMAZING! I'll definitely be making this on a regular basis",
