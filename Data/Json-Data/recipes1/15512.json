First of all, I knew I should have used gel coloring instead of liquid because the colors really faded during baking, so the finished product was just kind of dull looking. They tasted fine, but this recipe isn't really about taste (it's just a box cake mix, after all), it's more about presentation and I wasn't too thrilled. I frosted with Wedding Cake Icing from this site. Thanks for sharing :)",

So if the coloration doesn't work out then I would alter the drop count. Also personally I would eliminate the green since there is no brown color in the candy candy... just use drops of orange and drops of yellow for each separate bowl of batter (if you don't have orange red and yellow are fine...) and use as many drops as needed for the perfect color for you. I really like making cupcakes with these different coloring patterns because they can really be festive:) I will definitely be making a candy corn cupcake for Thanksgiving!!!",

I simply used too many drops of food coloring for my orange so it sank into my yellow batter for a tie dyed effect while baking but the point was still made and everyone loved them! You must be really careful not to overfill these... I could've made quite a few more regular sized cupcakes but I made not as many GIANT cupcakes by accident. Still great though! Will be making these again:)",

I used white cake mix and also french vanilla cake mix. I did the coloring for halloween. I used gel food coloring. I did Purple Green and Orange. It's easy with the gel food coloring. No mixing making colors just mix in until your happy with the batter color layer and there you go! I used betty crocker white whipped frosting colored it green then i used a 1/2 package of the flavor mix ins (i used orange creme)pipped on the top to give a little different flaor then topped that with halloween sprinkles! took the cupcakes to the office and everyone raved!
