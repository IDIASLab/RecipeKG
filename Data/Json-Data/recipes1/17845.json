Yes it is a corn muffin and thus could potentially pale in comparison to more elaborate side dishes. However for a weekday oh my what am I going to put on the side with my main dish?! option this hit the spot; after all how can you go wrong with bacon and cheese? I am sure that one could oomph it up with more herbs or spice. I would say that tarragon oregano or basil would give it a little more finesse. Personally next time I might just add about teaspoon of either smoky paprika or chipotle powder. I think the most important aspect is that my 1.5 and 3.5 year old boys really liked it which is reason enough for me. I must say that two muffins magically disappeared in the process of taking them out of the over and putting them on the plate",

I could only find an 11.5oz package of cornbread mix so I used that and doubled all the other ingredients. I also added a large handful of sliced scallions (green parts only). Also the cooking time wasn't long enough for me (but it could just be my extremely old oven). So I baked regular sized muffins at 400 for 15 minutes then turned down to 375 for 3-4 minutes and they were cooked all the way through without being dry. This made 18 muffins with the doubling. Next time I may add a pinch of salt to the batter as well but overall it's a great recipe. Thanks!",

I stumbled upon this recipe while looking for a way to use up some leftover bacon (other than just eating it by itself). I had most of the stuff but it wasn't the exact cornbread mix and I didn't have sour cream or the correct cheese. I used plain non-fat yogurt in place of the sour cream added a green onion and I used a shredded Italian cheese blend that I had. They turned out nicely! I bet they're even better if you follow the recipe but it's nice to know that you can vary it a little. Also if I make these again I will probably use cupcake liners to make clean up easier. Edit: made a version of these today and all of my cheese sank to the bottom! I don't know why:(",
