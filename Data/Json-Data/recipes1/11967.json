It turned out perfect. We served it over rice and the whole family really loved it (even my picky seven-year-old!)",

I poured a bit of the sauce on to the bottom of the pan put the chicken in and then poured the rest over the top and did not cover it. The sauce wasn't very watery that way the chicken stayed moist and it was pretty flavorful.",
