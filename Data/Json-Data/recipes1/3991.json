First I added about 1/2 cup of sundried tomatoes and a bit more artichokes than it called for. Then I added some cut up chicken breast (2 pieces) - which I sauteed in garlic and olive oil. I used fresh thyme instead of dried and used about 1 tablespoon instead of what the recipe called for. I also tried using both portobello and shitake mushrooms - but the shitake were far better. Lastly instead of adding the parmesan when the dish was finished and on the plate I added a slice of goat cheese to the top. It's really rich and creamy melts slightly into the pasta and is soooooo good.",

My chicken broth was my homemade broth using the carcass of Roast Sticky Chicken from this site so it had all that added flavor (but that's mostly what I use--never the canned stuff). Otherwise I followed the recipe. My hubby wants this again tomorrow. No problem with that! There are only the two of us and this makes a lot! But it was really delicious!",
