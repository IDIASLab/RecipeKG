Wife suggested needs to be sweeter stick with white sugar (however note that in many reviews of this dish a brown and white sugar mix is used and suggested). Also we don't use nuts because my son can have a non-tolerant reaction to them. But he didn't even finish his first slice. Wife thinks there's too much backing powder \"I can taste it try cutting it in half\". I didn't even know baking powder had a taste. I still don't. Wife did say something that hints on were to go with this. She noted that \"...muffin-like breads like this loaf can be tricky\". As you make this dish try keeping that hint in mind. For example are raisins a good addition? And any tricks you have to help keep a muffin from becoming a heavy blob they might need to be put in play here. I've given the dish a 4 star because I do like it. But again it's trickier than a rooky baker might want to take on. And that's just my story \"Rooky baker takes on more than family can chew\".",
