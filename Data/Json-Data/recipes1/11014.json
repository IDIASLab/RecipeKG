Using many different cheeses makes the lasagna tick! Perhaps adding a tad more sugar to the tomato mix would be nice for the tomato paste is quite concentrated. Also I would recommend putting something (an egg more cheese tomato sauce etc.) on the top layer of lasagna noodles so that they won't be burnt. Mmmmm.:)",
