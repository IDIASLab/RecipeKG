I agree with others that three cups of broth is certainly not enough. I've been making lentil soup for many years and I know how quickly the lentils absorb the liquid. I made my own stock with a leftover carcass and had to keep added canned broth. I'm German so the recipe title is what attracted me to view it and I really loved the caraway seed addition as it gave the soup a really nice flavor. In lieu of the parsley I used kale and added more seasonings than stated. Very good recipe but please keep an eye on it. Thanks Claire!",

I cooked it on the stove and it took about an hour or so. I used 4 cans of broth which created a very thick soup- it could have easily taken another can. The flavor is great however and i do recommend it. One other thing i might also use low sodium broth as it is a little salty.",

Increasing the water makes the flavor more and more forgettable with every ounce of corrective fluid added. If I make this again and I just might -- I will triple the fluid and triple the spices to go with it leaving the lentils & veg at the same amount. I can't help wondering if the original recipe meant three QUARTS of stock since it specifies a 5-6 quart slow cooker. I doubled the liquid and still had a little room left over in my 3 quart slow cooker...Thank you for sharing your recipe.",
