Very nice way to doctor up a jar of sauce for sure but the flavor could be enhanced with the addition of fresh herbs or crushed red pepper. I enjoyed this my boyfriend not so much but he prefers a garlic & oil pasta anyway. I added some grated parmesan & basil when served also. Not bad considering the simplicity. Very similar to a rose sauce or vodka sauce without the vodka (if that makes sense). This seems to thicken also so it's not very loose. I would make this again and try adding some herbs.:)",
