I use just straight goat cheese (not crumbled found in 'tubes-like' packaging) to wrap the grapes. Instead of almonds to roll them in I use crushed candied pecans (pecan pieces mixed within egg white brown sugar & vanilla. baked for 15 at 325- cooled and crushed) That's it! It's a delicious variation enjoyed by my family every holiday season!",

Pressing the grape right into the scoop the cheese will ooze up around the grape and you can pat it to cover completely and then just pop it onto a plate. Wear light-weight food service gloves and it's quick and clean! I used grapes that were quite large so needed to double the recipe to yield about 30. Fun to make and good eating!",
