Because of the funky name it was just about impossible to find again and I was so excited to come across it recently. This is a great winter dinner - I use just one big skillet which makes cleanup so simple. The simmering always takes longer than I remember but it fills the house with a great smell and everyone is so eager to eat when ready. A few variations: I don't grate the tomatoes just chop since they cook down so much anyway. I definitely do remove the lid and let simmer down and I love the potatoes after mashed. Remember that the larger chunks your potatoes are in the longer the cooking process will be. I've also added black and red beans to the tomato/onion mixture. I've used both fresh and frozen fish fillets (pollock cod want to try catfish) and they work equally well.",

Next time I will make the potato wedges thinner because they definitely didn't cook enough in 20 minutes and I worried about overcooking the fish while waiting for the potatoes to be ready. I am hoping to get some questions answered. First in the description of the recipe there is mention of lots of parsley but parsley is not in the list of ingredients nor is there any mention of adding it in the instructions. Second and less importantly the recipe says to cook the onion and tomato in half of the olive oil but I don't see where the rest of the olive oil is used. Any answers or thoughts are appreciated!",

I found that four medium potatoes were more than enough and the top-most potatoes didn't get cooked all the way through even with an extra 20 minutes of cooking. Next time I might cook the potatoes for a bit before putting in the fish as the cod fillets made it harder to stir the stew. Still a great recipe overall!",

There is a querie from someone else who posted a review regarding what to do with the parsely....I just ripped it up and put it on top of dish when serving.",

Stove or range? What heat setting? What was I supposed to do with the other half of the oil? Was I supposed to mash the potatoes for the recipe or just with my spoon for greater eating pleasure? I followed the ingredients exactly except that I used a pound of red potatoes cut in chunks to reduce the cook time instead of 8 large potatoes which wouldn't have fit the pot anyway. I simmered for 30 minutes. At the end I mashed half the potato chunks with the dish uncovered and still cooking to thicken it slightly. I never figured out when to add the rest of the oil so I never did! It came out VERY spicy possibly because it's missing some oil. How this is only 4 servings is beyond me. It makes a ton! Tasty simple and comforting. I'd make it again and add a green vegetable to the pot.",
