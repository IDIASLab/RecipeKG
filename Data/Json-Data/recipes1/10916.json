                "reviewBody": "If you prefer a thicker, more fruit preserve-like consistency for your chutney, you can modify the cooking method on this excellent recipe and its blend of flavors as I did: Using the 30 serving size recipe, use all ingredients as measured, except: Adjust sugar to 1/2 cup each white and brown, add 1 TBSP butter to your ingredient list, and try 2 TBSPs each white vinegar and lemon juice (vs. 1/4 cup vinegar).  For the cooking method: Set saucepan on medium heat (I used a 2.5 quart Le Creuset saucepan, which heats more evenly than any pan I have used, so medium high will be too high). Melt butter, and add dry spices, stirring with a silicone spatula or spoon, 2 mins. til fragrant.  Add all other ingredients (except nuts; you will add them at the end).  Stir gently until combined. It will take appr. 10 mins. for the mixture to come to a simmer.  Once the simmer has begun, set timer for 60 minutes, and cook, maintaining a gentle but consistent simmer (in my saucepan there were 10 pockets of nickel - size bubble groups across the top).  Stir gently with spatula every 5 mins. or so.  After 60 mins., turn off the heat and let cool in the saucepan.  The chutney will be reduced in volume, and will be the consistency of a fruit preserve.  Stir in 1/4 cup chopped slivered almonds or macadamia nuts.  Store in air tight container, refrigerate, and enjoy!  Great on Wasa crackers with cream cheese, or mixed with diced chicken for a salad!",

After reading the reviews and others thinking they might have cooked the sugar too much I cut down the first two intermitent cooking times to about 15 min and then cooked everything a little longer after adding the mango. I cooked it until the mango was almost translucent and had taken on the color of the sauce. I would add more mango next time it cooks down a little so maybe another half cup if you're doing the 30 serving recipe. The saucy part does thicken as it cools which was really nice. Overall this mango chutney smells great and tastes great.",
