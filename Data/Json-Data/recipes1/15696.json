I'm one of those people who can't stand overcooked food, and I prefer my salmon at a medium doneness. That said, the cook time here is way too short for 375F.  At 10 minutes it was barely cooked. I added 4 mins to the cook time (total of 14 mins), let it rest, took a pic before eating, and discovered it was still rare inside when I took a bite. While I don't mind rare, I did choose to stick it under the broiler for an additional 2 minutes and at that point, it was a perfect medium. Regardless of how long you choose to cook yours, I highly recommend broiling it at the end to get a nice caramelization on the fish. It really added a lot of flavor.   I also needed to salt it before eating, as it was a little bland. You could also marinate it longer to help with flavor.",
