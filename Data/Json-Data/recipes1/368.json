The cookies are simple, but combined with the flavorful frosting filling, are absolutely spectactular!  I've made them multiple ways, using either butter or margarine, rum or rum extract in the filling, ditto for the cookie base, and they turn out very good with any combination.  I fill these with a pastry bag and star tip - very cute if I do say so myself :)  Using real butter (& pastry bag), the filling does get very soft if your hands (or home) are hot, so I just stick the bag in the fridge for a while.  I have never had a problem with the frosting \"not setting up\".  Try them - you'll be glad you did!",

If you're having trouble spooning the filling into the cookie use a decorating tube or a plastic sandwich bag with a courner snipped out. I had no trouble with the spoon - and no trouble getting my co-workers to eat them too! Lots of compliments! I'm a bit confused that a previous reveiwer had runny filling...with the given ingredients in the correct amounts it shouldn't have happened. I'm curious as to what they did to make it \"runny\"! One thing I was particularly impressed with...whenever a cookie recipe calls for filling such as this there ends up being either way to much filling or not enough. This turned out to have EXACTLY the amount needed - no more no less! How cool is that?:) These would also be excellent to package up and send through the mail.",

I think next time I make it I will use rum flavoring instead of the vanilla flavoring in the cookie. I did mix the flour in with my KitchenAid on Stir, and baked on parchment paper, and they baked beautifully.  I did modify the filling recipe a little.  I used 2 tsp. rum flavoring, 2 tsp milk, and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg, (probably an extra tsp of powdered sugar as well).  It makes this frosting taste just like egg nog.  So delish!

A couple of things that maybe would have tripped me up might be helpful to others: in step 2 you need to mix the flour in by hand. I was buzzing away with my hand mixer when I caught myself! Definitely make into one inch balls. I thought they were too small but I was still just shy of yield. I used the end of a wooden spoon to make the indentations so I wouldn't have to use as much frosting. Lastly under step 4 mix the ingredients by hand. I started off with my mixer (again) and had to stop myself. Maybe that's why some cooks had runny frosting? So delicious - definitely a keeper!",

I think I would look for another sugar cookie recipe to substitute. Also they are homely-looking specimens. Perhaps rolling them in crushed nuts before baking? I only got 30 cookies from this recipe but I still needed to double the frosting. Also it came out very thick so I brought it to the right consistency with a couple of teaspoons of actual eggnog. Finally though I did not add extra rum as others did I still found the resulting cookies very boozy! I felt weird giving them to neighbors with children. So I might cut back or use rum extract next time. With some tweaking this recipe could be a fine addition to your holiday cookie trays and exchanges.",

The food editor at the Las Vegas Journal requested a special Christmas cookie to feature and this one immediately came to mind. I will be delivering them to the newspaper tomorrow ad I think they will agree with our review:) After reading some poor reviews I have some thoughts on what might have gone wrong. Burnt bottoms....oven is running too hot. My oven runs hot so I adjust my temp down. Hard or tough cookie....Over worked dough. You are supposed to cream the butter and sugar and then stir the flour in by hand. Overmixing would produce a very tough cookie. Dry....baked too long. My cookies were done at 11 minutes. Runny frosting....too much rum or not enough sugar or maybe melted butter? With these simple tips you will experience success. Enjoy!",

They really do taste like eggnog and the \"filling\" (more like frosting really) has a great texture. I didn't want to use real rum so I used 1/4 tsp rum extract and 1 tbs water. I was worried about them sitting out if I used milk as suggested. The frosting was still creamy and great I don't think milk would have made a big difference. Also you cannot use a rounded tsp of frosting on each cookie which is obvious when you see them baked. Just eyeball a small dollop large enough to almost fill the thumb indention and it works out well. These are excellent and highly recommended!",
