The cooking technique was just what I needed for an uncertain supper time and since Hubs detests overcooked vegetables it ensured that wouldn't be an issue. I blanched the broccoli ahead of time and when I knew Hubs would be ready to eat it was no big deal to quickly do the last minute sauteeing. Don't hesitate to use the brown sugar - it's not enough to taste any sweetness but just enough to eliminate any possibility of broccoli bitterness. And in my (Italian) book anything that calls for fresh Parmesan cheese is always a plus. Flawless recipe and certainly one to keep in the reference file.",
