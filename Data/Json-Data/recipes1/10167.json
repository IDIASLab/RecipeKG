Also, another trick is to use fresh bocconcini (the smaller fresh moz. balls) and to use very fresh Roma (chopped) tomatoes or cherry/plum tomatoes.  I add a lot of balsamic dressing with only a splash of olive oil (plus at least 3-4 cloves of fresh chopped garlic).  Mix together and let the flavors marinate together (it tastes delicious when the balsamic vinegar and garlic flavors soak into the cheese).  Just a little Sicilian twist to the caprese salad.",

Use tomatoes on the vine, not beefsteaks.  If at all possible, use Buffalo mozzerrella, it is absolutely, UNBELIEVABLY moist and delicious and tastes nothing like the over-processed variety (if you live in the mid-Atlantic, Wegman's has it).  I personally like to drizzle a little good Balsamic on at the end and sometimes sprinkle some kosher salt on top.  Mmmmmmmm......",
