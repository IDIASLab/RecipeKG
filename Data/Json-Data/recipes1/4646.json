So, knowing how many calories I could save, I made some modifications, and this is now one of my most-requested recipes. My modifications: Instead of 3 cups all-purpose flour, I use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups AP. I use 1.5 cups white sugar instead of the full 2 cups. \nI use 1 1/4 cups unsweetened applesauce in place of ALL of the oil. I use 3/4 cup of eggbeaters in place of the eggs. I increase the chopped apples to 4 cups. I omit the nuts. I make the topping as written, but serve it as a sauce on the side rather than dumping it on top. That seems like a lot of changes, but it's really a fabulous cake that CAN BE less awful for you!! :-)",

Make sure to mix the flour and the oil mixture well before adding apples and nuts. That should stop the problem of \"crumbling\" that some people are experiencing. I baked this in a 9X13 stoneware baking pan. It came out moist and stayed that way for days. I used dark brown sugar in the topping and added 1/8 tsp of salt in the glaze to make the tongue more receptive to all the flavors (a baker's trick).

(Next time I'll add more nutmeg and cinnamon) I beat the eggs and oil together before adding them to the dry ingredients. I was sure to mix the batter thoroughly. The consistency was not dense but moist and light. Personally I prefer a dense cake but since I was making this for co-workers I wanted the cake to be more cake-like. Most of my co-workers like fluffy cakes. I highly recommend this recipe.",

I baked it anyway and it came out perfect! The only changes that I made were adding some cinnamon (can't have apples without cinnamon can you?) and substituted pecans for walnuts just cuz thats what I had on hand.

The cake has a very nice texture and the perfect sweetness; in my opinion serving it with a glaze made it too sweet so I'd suggest serving it without the glaze.
