I did my research and found that the bacteria lives more in the yolk and is not as likely to live in the white.  Wisk the yolks and the condensed milk over a very low heat stirring constantly till it reaches 140-160 degrees.  You must have the liquid of the milk in with the yolks or it will coagulate and produce scrabmled eggs.  Keep stirring occasionally till cooled and follow the rest of the recipe.  It takes a little longer but is just as good.  I have 2 small children and I am pregnant so it worked for me.",

Instead, subsitute a pint of whipping cream (whipped), and fold it in with the yolks, rum, & sugar, then carefully fold in the egg whites. It's sooo much better!

                "reviewBody": "This eggnog is pretty good. I'm still searching for the perfect eggnog but this is a good start. Here are some tips: - Use pasteurized-in-shell eggs. You can buy them by the dozen. They're found with the regular eggs. I use them when I make ice cream as well. - 5 oz of sweetened condensed milk is a little confusing. The store I was at sells 5 oz cans of evaporated milk which may explain why some people complained the recipe was not sweet at all. Also sweetened condensed milk is sold by weight so a 14 oz can of it doesn't have anywhere near 14 oz of liquid. I took the recipe as calling for 5 oz liquid (more than half the can) and it still could use a little more sweetening. - When separating your eggs remember the tiniest bit of yolk in your whites will keep them from getting stiff. This recipe is good enough to bring to my in-laws for the family gathering but for that batch I'm going to throw in some heavy cream. It's still not quite rich enough. For my trial batch I did mix in a little cinnamon and I think I'll also throw in some allspice into the next batch. All in all a good recipe. Flexible enough to play with and still end up with something drinkable.",

But for what I was looking for I needed to make a few modifications and then it became an excellent egg nog. I substituted half of the milk for whipping cream. Whipped the cream by hand the old fashion way. After adding half the milk the recipe called for I folded in the whipped cream and the stiffened egg whites. That gave it just the right thickness texture and consistency I wanted. Of course the ratio of whipping cream vs milk can be modified to one's preference. Additionally I doubled the dark rum and added a splash of Brandy for good measure. That did the trick. The one fluid ounce of rum the recipe called for just wasn't enough in my opinion. The end result was simply an amazing egg nog that was a big hit. This is a calorie and saturated fat bomb by the way but if you are considering making egg nog I suspect you are like me and that not really a dissuading factor.",
