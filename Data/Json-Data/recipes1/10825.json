However, I altered this slightly, to compensate, and found this wonderful combo.  I only used 1 pound of Kielbasa, so keep that in mind. What ended up in the sauce was: 1 cup ketchup, 3/4 cup grape jelly, 1/4 spicy brown mustard, 1 1/2 TBSP Wostershire, 2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, and 3 TBSP savory BBQ sauce(I used America's Choice Kansas City Style).  The result is currently disappearing from the pan, it never made it to a dish.  Thanks for a good starter recipe!",

He then served it on top of plain cooked white rice. It was Awesome! and everyone was asking him for the receipe!!! \n\nSo if you want to try something different, then use barbecue sauce as a substitute for ketchup and trying serving it on top of some cooked white rice!!!",

Yes, Heinz makes that too...same aisle in your grocery store.  Seriously tho, it's not quite as \"tomato-y\", (can guys use that word?) as the Ketchup and still comes out really good.  The Grape Jelly has all the sweet you need, so Chili Sauce is a nice balance.  Also, just throw it all in together and let it meld.  The juices from the Kielbasa make the glaze quite killer.  I'd go just a tad longer on the cooking time too.  At least an hour or two.  Come back and thank me later.",
