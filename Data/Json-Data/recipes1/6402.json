I use white whole wheat flour (King Arthur and Wheat Montana sell a white spring kernel variety, which is lighter and sweeter than regular whole wheat, but just as nutritious), and it still tastes like regular chocolate cake. Also, I can trim the fat without it tasting low-fat.I replace 1/2 cup to 1 cup of the oil with applesauce or mashed pear (use a small hole grater on an apple if you don't have any applesauce). I've made this recipe three times now, and when I'm not being health-conscious, I love it with chocolate glaze. I make a quick one with cocoa powder (mix 2 TBS oil, 2 TBS melted butter, 2TBS Karo syrup, 2 tsp vanilla, 6 TBS cocoa powder, 1.5 cups powdered sugar and 1/2 cup milk or more depending on your desired consistency).",

The cake is still excellent and everyone still loves it, but I wanted to let you know that it is also now a blue ribbon winner!  I entered it in the chocolate cake category at our county fair.  I frosted it with a vanilla powdered sugar frosting and it took FIRST place.  Just thought you would like to know.  Thanks a gain for the terrific recipe and new family favorite.  P. S. My husband is very finicky about vegetables even when they're in breads or cakes and he really loves this cake.",

I  cut the oil to 3/4 cup and added 3/4 cup of apple sauce. And instead of using all, all-purpose flour, I used 1 cup of all-purpose and 1 cup of whole wheat. I also cut the sugar in half because the applesauce is sweet so that would make up for some of the missing sugar and then I added a tsp of vanilla. Anyway, when I brought this cake to my friends birthday party, everybody raved about it! Even my friend who hates all vegetables and fruits LOVED it (she still doesn't know that it was a zucchini cake because I haven't told her yet). AWESOME cake :)",

We all agreed that 1 cup was just right - too much more would have resulted in a dense, greasy cake. No need to use applesauce for some of the oil, either. This cake was perfectly moist with just 1 cup of oil. We also left out the nuts, which was just fine. I used olive oil, as I do with most of my baking, and it was great. We all agreed the cake tasted better room temp the next day rather than warm out of the oven. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!",
