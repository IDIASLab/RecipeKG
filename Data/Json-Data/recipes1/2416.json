I'm rating it a 4 as written because I think the flavour of the cinnamon would be lost by just sprinkling it dry in the middle. once the batter was finished I took out about 1/3 and put in a separate bowl. I added the brown sugar and doubled the cinnamon to this batter and stirred well. I then poured some of the original batter into the pan then a few spoonfuls of the cinnamon batter back to the original batter until both bowls were empty and in the pan. I then used a knife to swirl the 2 batters. (as you would a marble cake). MMMM GOOD! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!",

Not sure what needed to be added to make the flavor \"pop\" but the coconut wasn't apparent and adding more cinnamon would just make it a cinnamon loaf. Not adding this to my list of favs.",
