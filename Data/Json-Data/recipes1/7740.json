I don't cook meat very well so even something as simple as throwing it in a skillet like this didn't turn out great. However the taste of the mixture w/o the meat made up for my abilities... or lack of. I didn't use the mayo mixture for a dressing because it tasted so good w/o it I didn't see the need for it. I also didn't really like the dressing. I added taco seasoning to the meat before adding it and omitted the taco sauce. I also put a dollop of sour cream on top for a little extra taste on some bites. I couldn't find any shredded pepperjack so I used a shredded cheddarjack mix. I didn't use chips in it at all for carb reasons. I also added chopped tomatoes. I would make this again. Oh and it tasted great warmed up for lunch.:)",

I fried the chicken in taco seasoning used a jar of garlic salsa instead of taco sauce omited the olives and pickles and kept the lettuce and chips seperate so they stay crisp for leftovers. It was a great combination the sauce worked wonderfully once everything was put together. We would give this a 4.5 but that's not an option and it wasn't outstanding enough for a 5. We will definately make this recipe again!",
