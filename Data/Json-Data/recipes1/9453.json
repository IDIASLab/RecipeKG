On top of the recipe I added; 1/4 Worcestershire sauce 1 TBSP McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Steak seasoning 1 tsp Salt Free Garlic & Herb Mrs. Dash and 1/4 Cup Kraft Sweet'n Sour sauce. I bought a bulk pack of pork chops from the grocery store and used this marinade on them. I put the pork chops in Ziploc freezer bags and used 1/4 cup of marinade on each then I put them in the freezer. I use this technique for all kinds of meat. I put marinade in the bags with the meat and put them in the freezer. Then I have stuff ready and flavorful so I can just take them out the night before. I only had 7 pieces and I still had some marinade left over. 1/4 cup was enough to cover the chops plus some so if you used a little less per chop you could easily marinade 10 pieces of pork out of this recipe w/ my additions. I put a pair of them in the fridge right away and made them the next night. They were AMAZING!!! Sooo good. They weren't super chewy but not melt in your mouth either. Not too salty either. Great recipe. I'll save this one.:)",

I did not think they were too salty but just right; however they may have been more salty had I marinated them longer. I believe a little water added to the recipe will probably make it just right for overnight marinating.
