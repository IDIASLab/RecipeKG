I made this on the spur of the moment and only had 1/2 a cup of pecans so I used chopped walnuts for the rest and it was still delicious! (In fact no one even realized it was mostly walnuts until I passed out the recipe!) Thanks for the great recipe it's a definitely a keeper! And a tip for getting a good bottom crust without having to pre-bake is to always use a glass or ceramic dish stay away from the aluminum pans...",

It always fills a large pie pan and it bakes up beautifully. I will confirm that a glass or ceramic dish is best with a roll out pie crust instead of the pre-made metal tin pie crusts. But even then it's still good. The only recommendation I have is to let it cook an extra 5 to 8 minutes more than mentioned above. I cook on the center rack so as not to over brown my pecans but I think it sets up much better with that extra 5 minutes on it.",
