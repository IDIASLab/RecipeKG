Used pineapple cream cheese frosting from this site and added some almond extract to kick up the flavor a bit.",

I used a cherry chip cake mix and even though the pinapple juice did make the cake moist I did not like the taste of the pinapple chuncks in the cake. I felt that it just did not go well. I also found this cake to be rather dry and had a lot of trouble getting it out of the cake pans. The cake ripped while trying to remove from both cake pans. I notice that this cake receipe does not call for any oil I think that had something to do with it. Now I see why most cake recipies call for at least a cup of oil. I also tried making a cherry cream cheese frosting by mixing cherry kool-aid with butter cream cheese and icing sugar. Even though the cherry kool-aid gave the icing a nice red cherry colour it did not taste good at all. I won't try using kool-aid in a frosting receipe again. I ended up throwing out 3/4 of the cake.",
