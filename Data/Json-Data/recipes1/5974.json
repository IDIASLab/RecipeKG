This recipe sounded to me like it should be served warm = so I added some cooked/cubed chicken breast and added into the sauce. I then sauted the red & green bell pepper onion celery and garlic = added them warm to the \"sauce.\" Last I cooked Thai rice noodles (for \"authenticity\") and mixed to coat with the sauce chicken and veggies.

Also I doubled the recipe. Tastes great the way it's written but I did add shredded carrot water chestnuts and thinly sauteed beef to make it a main meal.

This is very good very easy and very close to the recipe I was looking for. I used the full 2 tsp. of crushed red pepper because we like everything hot and spicy but if you don't -- definitely cut the recipe back. I added about 1/2 - 1 tsp. red wine vinegar as that is called for in the original recipe (as well as soy sauce etc.) and that helped round out the salad quite nicely. I made vegetarian broth in the microwave and added the peanut butter to that before putting it all in the large bowl and had no problem with the peanut butter breaking down. Once you let it sit it becomes less soupy even with the whole wheat noodles I used. This is an excellent recipe!",

I also used chicken broth instead of veggie broth (just what I had on hand). I used whole wheat rotini pasta (I'm sure it would have been more authentic with flat noodles) and I doubled the sauce recipe for the whole box of noodles. I cut back on the red pepper flakes just because it looked like an awful lot when I started adding them to the sauce (even though I like things spicy). I also took the advice of others and softened the PB in the microwave for 30 seconds before mixing and it worked beautifully! I also added a few dashes of ground ginger to the sauce. For veggies I used frozen peas thinly sliced carrots red bell pepper green onions and bean sprouts. I also added some roasted salted cashews. My husband especially enjoyed it!
