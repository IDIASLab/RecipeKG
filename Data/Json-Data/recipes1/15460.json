You must let it sit for at least 3 hours for the flavors to develop completely.  I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry because they taste just fine after being in the fridge and added a smidge more feta cheese.  Make sure you add salt and pepper to the dressing as well as the again to the salad after mixing.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this one.",
