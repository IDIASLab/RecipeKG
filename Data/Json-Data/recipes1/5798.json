I halved the recipe because I was only serving three people including me and only used 6 chicken legs. I only used 1 can cream of mushroom soup plus 2 tablespoons of water. I also added 1 can of mushrooms. I didn't use the smoked beef because I didn't have any but it seemed fine without it. I baked it for 2 hours at 375 degrees and the chicken was wonderfully tender.
