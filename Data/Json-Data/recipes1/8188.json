I also took suggestions from previous reviews and deleted the bananas and lemon juice and added a couple tablespoons of coconut.  Since I didn't have any sour cream, I used cottage cheese after running it through the food processor.  I also added miniature marshmallows and deleted the sugar.  The finished product had a surprisingly good flavor with not much sugar!  Will definitely make it again.  Thank you for sharing it.",
