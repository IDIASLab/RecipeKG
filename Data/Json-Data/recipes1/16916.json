The spinach I used was frozen--I made sure to thaw it and really squeeze the moisture out of it before I added it to the casserole ingredients. I also sauteed the vegetables in butter because I happen to be out of oil right now. This turned out really good--my youngest especially liked it. Next time, I would add some fresh garlic and I'd cut back on the milk a little next time. This was a great way for me to use up leftover rolls and get a little \"green\" in the family's diet.",

Note: I made sure to cut off large stems & veins in the spinach before cooking (they're unpalatable) & drained/blotted the spinach with paper towels rather than a tea towel. This type of recipe is very forgiving & adjustable to taste but I found that just as it is it's a nice blend & layering of flavors. Don't be afraid of the hot sauce it adds a subtle but nice contrast to the other ingredients.",

I also put the sausage in a collander and let it drain while fixing the other components then took paper towel to it and got even more grease off. The casserole was moist and very flavorful.

I took the leftovers home and heated them up the next day for breakfast and they tasted great! I recommend covering it with foil the entire time it bakes then take off the foil at the end so the cheese gets crispy. Setting it out to rest afterwards is a must or the rolls are soggy and gross!!",
