I sauteed the pepper and onion in 1T of vegetable oil for a few minutes. Then I added the ground beef and a packet of Taco seasoning mix. I used an entire jar of salsa, a heaping half cup of reduced fat sour cream and I didn't measure the shredded cheese. I just added as much as I liked on the top of the dish. I used a mexican blend of shredded cheese. This made more than four servings as I believe the macaroni made more than the noodles would have. Plus I used a large pepper. This was very tasty. Everyone liked it. I will definitely make this again and again.",

I didn't drain the meat after browning and I omitted the water. I served it over egg noodles with sour cream and shredded muenster cheese.
