The only adjustments I made were 1.) cut the baking soda in half for a slightly denser cookie and 2.) cut the salt in half as well (it tends to overpower the cookie). Otherwise these are easy and delicious!! Excellent recipe!",

These were very easy for me to make as they were my first cookie that I made from this website.

I think that next time I'm going to put something else in them to make them a little more flavor in them and use a little less butter. I also think I may have used a little too much baking soda in them as they were dry. But they were GOOD!",
