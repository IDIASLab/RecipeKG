The only thing I changed was I used 1/2 tsp of salt...a full teaspoon seemed like just a bit too much.  The cookies are wonderful.  For those who had trouble...don't forget to only use eggs and butter at room temp.  It makes a big difference!  Don't use dark cookies sheets...they'll burn.  The use of more brown sugar than white sugar keeps these nice and chewy for days!  Thanks for the recipe!",

On the up side there's a lot of butter in these cookies and the taste really comes through - they're buttery rich and delicious and there's kind of a sweet/salty thing going on that really is good. On the flip side however there's a lot of butter in these cookies - which makes them not as thick as I prefer and a little on the greasy side. I did add 1/2 tsp. of baking powder in addition to the baking soda to give them a little more lift and as I always do with cookie doughs made with butter I chilled the dough for about an hour. Still they spread quite a bit while baking and a flat spread-out cookie is not very attractive to me. This would be a five star cookie if I was eating them blindfolded!",
