                "reviewBody": "My favorite pie on the planet is a Strawberry Rhubarb Pie I've been making for probably 40 years and look forward to every spring. So making this pie was a real departure, and I only did so because I got a little carried away with my market's sale on berries. What a treat! I used 2 c. rhubarb, 2 c. raspberries, and a cup of blueberries, and simply added a tad more sugar and flour to compensate for the extra amount of berries. There is no need to start this the night before--just let the berries and rhubarb sit in the sugar/flour mixture until they start to release their juices, stirring every so often.  Because rhubarb and raspberries are tart I omitted the lemon juice and was glad I did.  I didn't bother with melting the butter, just dotted it with a little butter before slipping on the top crust. For those who are not big fans of rhubarb this may be a good recipe, as the rhubarb flavor is subtle.  Rhubarb lovers might want to add more! Either way, this is a beautiful, jewel-toned pie that perfectly showcases the flavors of the season.",

I used about 8 cups of fruit, so I doubled the flour and used about 1 1/4 c. sugar.  I usually don't make berry pies and have learned my lesson to let it sit overnight before cutting it.  I couldn't help myself, cut into it warm and it was VERY runny - but the next morning it was all set up, so I think I had about the right measures of flour and sugar..  Just didn't have the patience to wait to eat it!!!  The crust is perfect.  I will use that recipe again for other pies.  It's just the right mix of crunchy and flaky.",

Don't let the two day prep time deter you; it takes so little time each day that it isn't worth worrying about. Also other than the raspberries I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't have problems with it not filling a 9-inch pie plate or being too runny. Try it and enjoy!",

To make it even easier I used the Pie Crust III recipe (also allrecipes - and AMAZING): I also believe the Pie Crust III recipe prevented the \"runny\" issues another reviewer had since it's a substantial chewy crust that can hold those yummy juices. For the crust I followed the tips from reviewers (added 2 tsp sugar 1 tsp salt and made 1.5 x the dough). I'll second the pie reviewer who said you don't need to let it sit overnight (maybe 2 hours) but I DID add the lemon juice/butter and was VERY glad - it added the perfect tang just make sure you use fresh lemon juice (not bottled). Seriously. This is a slice of heaven. I didn't even care for ice cream with it because I didn't want ANYTHING detracting from the perfect tang of the berries and the flaky perfect texture of the sweet crust. MAKE THIS PIE!!!",
