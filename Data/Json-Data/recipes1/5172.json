Because I have never like can tomatoes in anything I made they always seem to overpower a dish and all I taste is tomato. But this blew me away oh so good! The only thing is I had half the sauce left over could of easily used another box of shells. This was absolutely delish!",

I added the hamburger meat to that sauce. I also used an egg and mixed the cottage cheese with the egg some mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. As others suggested I used a zip lock bag with the tip cut off for putting the cheese mixture into the shells. That worked very well. I spooned in the sauce on top of that inside the shells after they were all filled I put more mozzarella and Parmesan and garlic powder on the top of all of it and then baked for 30 minutes. I usually won't give a lower than 5 rating to a recipe that I modified. In this case it seemed the shells would not actually be very stuffed but more cooked in sauce...if you stuffed them with just the beef. I layered everything inside the shells no sauce poured on the top or under which did take some time but they came out Wonderful. Thank you for sharing your recipe!",
