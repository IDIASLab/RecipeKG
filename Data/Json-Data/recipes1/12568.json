Stretch the pizza dough to fit a large cookie sheet.  Double the amount of provolone cheese because you will need extra to cover the stretched pizza dough.  You will also need to double the amount of pears, walnuts and gorgonzola.   Stretching the dough makes the crust not as thick and really improves the presentation of the pizza (as well as the taste).  Enjoy!",

Great sweet/savory combination.\n\nI used cornmeal under the crust (for crunch and to keep it from sticking to the pan) and pre-baked it for 6 minutes.  I also rubbed a garlic clove on the crust and brushed it with olive oil before adding the toppings.  \n\nGreat pizza! :)",
