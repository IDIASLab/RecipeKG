The peanut butter layer froze solid and could only be sliced by removing the entire dessert from the pan laying it on the countertop and sawing it with a heated bread knife. The ice cream sandwiches melted into a sticky mess but the top stayed solid so it was not visually appealing once I did get to serve it. I don't know if it was a mistake I made in preparation perhaps or maybe that I used creamy peanut butter instead? The guests LOVED the taste but it wasn't worth the effort that went into sawing it apart.",
