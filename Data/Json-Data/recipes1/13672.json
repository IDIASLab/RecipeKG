The fudge seems a little grainy after setting but even conventional fudge always turns out grainy for me so I'm pretty sure the problem is me not the recipe.:) I wasn't sure whether to use untoasted almonds or to toast them....went with untoasted and as I said above it turned out lovely. I'm sure using toasted nuts would be fine too. I found this recipe when I was looking for a candy recipe that I could make without chocolate or cocoa powder. This fudge is great because it doesn't require fancy ingredients; just stuff I ordinarily have on hand. (The only iffy ingredient would be almonds but I'm sure other nuts than almonds would work e.g. peanuts pecans walnuts etc or just omitting nuts altogether.)",
