I used 1/2 cup of real butter(margarine is terrible for you) 1/2 cup less sugar used 1/4 cup more reduced fat sour cream used chunky spiced applesauce from trader joes softened the raisin in the boiling water with the noodles and used almost a cup of graham cracker powder and 1 tsp cinnamon mixed with 4 table spoons of melted butter and sprinkled that mixture on the top instead of on the bottom. I baked for 50 minutes. Next time I might even cut the sugar some more. I think the graham cracker \"crust\" prevented the noodles from getting dry and burnt. The crust was a nice golden brown - no burning.",

She called it the \"best kugel I have ever had in my entire life.\" I still don't like most kugels but this has become one of my favorite year-round dishes. I use only 1 C sugar 8 oz of chunky applesauce soaked sultanas (golden raisins) and no graham crackers crumbs. It is far less sweet and creamy than most kugels this way and it really emphasises the appley-cinnamon flavour.",
