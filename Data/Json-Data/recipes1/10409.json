However, I am impressed by how crisp is gets in the oven, so kudos on that.  Overall, I think this is a good alternative to frying eggplant for another recipe, or a good start for eggplant parmesan.  \n\nOne hint for those of you who may not know:  if you find eggplant to be too acidic, always be sure to buy the \"male\" eggplants (they are long and thin compared to the \"females\" which are shorter, fatter and rounder).   Also, you can sweat the eggplant before you use it.  So, slice it (or cube it or whatever you are doing with it) and rub it with a little lemon juice (eggplant browns quickly once cut), and salt it heavily.  Let it sit for 30-60 minutes.  You will find a puddle of pinkish tinted liquid at the end of the time.  Then quickly rinse it and follow your recipe.  You will find doing this makes is FAR less acidic or strong tasting. Enjoy!",
