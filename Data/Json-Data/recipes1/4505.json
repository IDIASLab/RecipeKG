I think the directions need a little help - for instance it never does mention draining the almonds. I let mine sit on paper towels while I prepared the other ingredients. My mixture was still pretty wet and very loose. The recipe also doesn't mention how much \"batter\" to use for each cookie. I used a small cookie scoop to form mine. I needed to line my dehydrator trays with parchment paper (poked full of holes) or the \"batter\" would have fallen right through. My cookies were completely dry at the 12 hour mark. I probably won't make these again. Rather than a strawberry flavor I mostly taste the raisins - the very dry raisins. They almost have a burn taste to them from the drying process.",
