I baked mine in a 4 inch deep 8 inch round pan and just dumped all the batter in and it reached a little more than 1/2 of the pan. I checked at 3o minutes as the recipe recommends but the center was still soft so I slightly decreased the temp so it wouldn't brown too much and ended up baking it an additional 15 minutes or a total of 45 minutes. I used cake flour instead of all purpose and added an additional banana and it came out GREAT! No need for any glaze or frosting on this one.",
