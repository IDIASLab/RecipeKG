I sauteed the minced garlic along with some diced onion (about 1/4 c.) in a couple Tbsp. of olive oil then added 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes along with 1/2 cup of vodka. I let that simmer for a few minutes. After adding the crushed tomatoes I added 1 Tbsp. of basil 1/4 tsp. of oregano 1 tsp. of parsley 1/2 tsp. of salt and 2 tsp. of sugar. After that simmered for about 15 minutes I then added 1 cup of light cream along with 1/2 cup of grated parmesan to make it extra creamy. Great with a side of garlic bread!",

When the sauce was done I thought it looked more like a rich tomato soup (perhaps not a bad idea maybe next time I will just serve the sauce in a bowl with some bread!) I had some Absolute Peppar that I wanted to use but was advised against it. Would be interested if anyone tries that and how it turns out. If you do I would suggest not putting in the crushed red pepper with it.",
