He even loved to share it with his guy friends, they all raved. Thank You.\nUPDATE: I have made this a dozen times now and I make the following changes to the recipes.  First, I use a 26 oz. jar of prepared tomato sauce (sometimes more depending on how thick the sauce ends up), I use the whole 16 oz. cottage cheese (small curd) container because I have never found it in 8 oz., I omit the bell pepper (not our favorite, sometimes I substitute a red bell pepper, but it is good without), and top the whole thing with a couple cups of shredded cheese (mozzarella or Italian mixture).  This is very thick, rich and delicious.",

We made it again tonight for a family dinner.  As I suspected the first time--there isn't enough sauce.  If the tomato sauce was doubled, I believe this recipe would be a 5-star.  The cheese mixture has wonderful flavor , so we will be making this often but will be doubling the sauce.",

I added 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning; I used 1/2 of 12oz can of tomato sauce and 1 12 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  I added to eggs to the cottage cheese and sour cream and I left out the cream cheese, green onions and Parmesan cheese.  My recipes makes 6 servings at 465 calories a serving.  My husband and I just raved all weekend we loved it so much.  One more thing, when you take it out of the oven (we baked it for 25 minutes) let it sit for about 10 to 15 minutes -- the flavors meld and the taste is great.",
