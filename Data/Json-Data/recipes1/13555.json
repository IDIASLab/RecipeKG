It is a recipe that's been in our family for years, but I want to share it so everybody can enjoy it for the Holidays!!!  You will never want to use any other pumpkin pie recipe from now on. A wonderful option is to sprinkle the finished pie with almond toffee brickle chips. (Note: This recipe contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs. For more information visit our Hints and Tips pages.)",

The gelatin has to be dissolved in boiling water, the filling needs to cool before adding the eggs, and the eggs need to be REALLY stiff before folding them into the pumpkin mixture.  I used 3/4 cup of sugar and still found it a bit too sweet, and used 1/2 tsp salt to balance it. I used cinnamon, ginger and cloves for spices and pasturized egg whites.  LOVED it - reminded me of the pie my Aunt made when I was a kid!",
