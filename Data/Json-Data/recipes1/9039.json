Served it with Paula Deens Cottage Potato's and steamed vegetables. No complaints from the boys who were over for dinner.   Went down well with a 2004 Pinot Noir. Will make this again.",

I chose this recipe based on the high marks and the easy ingredients.  I substituted ground turkey for the beef, and followed the \"most helpful\" suggestions of sauteeing the onions in butter + garlic, and adding 1 Tbsp. of worchestshire to the meat mix.  Other than that, followed the recipe completely, and it was wonderful!!!  Very tasty and moist (one thing I can't stand is a dry meatloaf, not this one!) and I have a feeling it will make great meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow.  Thanks for the post!",

A 1.30# of meat cooked in an hour.  This turned out great and we went back for seconds even when my man is sick and said he wasn't hungry!  I personally thought the topping was a tad too sweet so I would do everything the same next time except reduce the brown sugar some.  This was very easy and a big hit.

Seasoned breadcrumbs are a must for this recipe; Would be very bland without them. Thanks for the great recipe! :)",

                "reviewBody": "Hands down, this was the best meatloaf that I've ever made.  I used about 2.3 lbs. of ground beef.  \n\nFollowing some of the advice of others as well as adding a few of my own tweaks, the meatloaf was perfect.  \n\nHere's what I did:\n\n1.  I saut\u00e9ed finely chopped onion, 3 cloves (minced garlic) & 2 stalks of celery in butter (which really makes the loaf tender); then added it to the ground beef.\n\n2.  I added 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to the ground beef mixture along with 2 eggs instead of 1, 1 1/4 cup of milk & about 1 1/2 cup of dried Italian bread crumbs.\n\n3.  For the sauce:  I initially made it as the directions indicated with 2 TBSP. of brown sugar, and found it to be way too sweet.  I then added 1/3 more ketchup and a couple of dashes of Worcestershire Sauce and it was perfect.\n\n4.  It was an abundance of sauce, and a lot of the other reviews said that there wasn't enough sauce, so I spooned a thin layer at the bottom of the loaf, molded half the loaf, then sauced the top, and then added the rest of the loaf on top and sauced it really well.  This was absolutely perfect.  \n\n5.  Lastly, there was no specification on whether or not to cook the meatloaf covered or uncovered.  I used enough aluminum foil to line the baking dish as well as cover the top (so I essentially wrapped the loaf in foil) and cooked covered for 45 minutes, drained most of any accumulated liquid and cooked uncovered for an additional 30 minutes.\n\nThis was super moist and delicious!!!!!",
