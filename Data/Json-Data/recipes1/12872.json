If you don't want it to be mushy, use lean ground beef (90/10) and put in extra bread crumbs until you get the desired consistency. I use italian style bread crumbs.  Also, for the mustard use dijon. I use 1/8 tsp. of cayenne pepper instead of crushed red pepper. You may have to cook it for 50-55 minutes depending on your oven.  I also double the sauce and add more brown sugar to it.",

I used a mix of ground pork and beef, chili sauce instead of ketchup for more tang, added minced garlic and used panko (japanese breadcrumbs) instead of fresh.  I doubled the sauce and replaced 2 tlbs of the brown sugar with maple syrup.  It was great and not all crumbly!",

I didn't have enough ketchup so I used about a 1/4 cup in both the meat and the sauce and added an extra 1/4 cup of tomato juice in both to make up for it. I was worried that it would be too runny but it wasn't. It wasn't too sweet either and it held together really well. So good I had seconds:)",

For children I only use 1/2 the red pepper flakes but don't leave out completely (adults prefer full amount). I use homemade whole wheat bread crumbs (tastes same as white but healthier). I also add 1/2 teaspoon chopped garlic but it's not necessary. Best with extra lean ground beef which has less fat to drain. Tip: don't line loaf pan with foil as meat still sticks & it gives a tinny taste. I use parchment paper or better yet an unlined ungreased silicone loaf pan. I always make 2 & freeze 1 unbaked. Great with mashed potatoes & corn. Many thanks for the only meatloaf recipe my family will ever use!",
