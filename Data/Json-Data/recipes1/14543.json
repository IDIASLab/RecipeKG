I will let you all in on a little secret though.  The only liquid you need to add is the water(about half to 3/4 to the top of the pot) You do not need beer, chicken broth or any other liquid for flavor. The only spice I would recommend is either the packet that comes with the corned beef or some whole peppercorns.  Otherwise the meat  will do all of the flavoring for you.  Also, I always add my potatoes in the beginning along with the carrots and onion.  They do not come out mushy at all, just very melt in your mouth tasty.  You can leave them in larger pieces or you can use the small whole potatoes.  Then for the last hour of cooking you can add your cabbage. Very simple meal but so delicious.",

Few observations:  the recipe definitely meant to say 8 hours on LOW, I can't imagine how it would have turned out otherwise, nor can I think of any crock pot recipe that is cooked THAT long on high.  Secondly, use beef broth instead of water, it gives that much more flavor. Finally, I took out the roast and let it rest for 20 minutes and threw the cabbage in.  It was perfectly cooked in the 20 minutes and not soggy at all.",

NO SALT!!!!!  5 red potatoes (instead of 10 - leaves more liquid in pot). 3 carrots (sliced instead of matchstick pieces). No cabbage (cooked seperately to prevent sogginess). 2 Onions (quartered).

I have to detail what I did in this review so that I don\u2019t forget what I did and can duplicate it the next time I make it!  I started the meat alone, with a bottle of Guinness and enough water to cover, on \u201chigh\u201d for an hour and then turned it to \u201clow.\u201d   Three hours after I started it I added the (peeled) potatoes and carrots (no onion).  Late afternoon I gave it another hour on high, then turned it back down to low. I cooked the (savoy) cabbage separately on the stovetop in some of the strained cooking liquid from the slow cooker.  The meat, sliced against the grain, was tender as can be and cut into perfect slices.  The potatoes, also, were cooked to the ideal tenderness. \u201cCreamy Horseradish and Garlic Spread,\u201d recipe also from this site, was EXCELLENT with the meat and \u201cGrandma Andrews\u2019 Irish Soda Bread,\u201d also excellent I might add, rounded out this memorable St.Patrick\u2019s Day meal.  I SO wish I would have taken a picture of this gorgeous dinner, but everyone was in a big hurry to eat!",
