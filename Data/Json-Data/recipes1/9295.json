I did make a few small changes to the recipe, but nothing substantive...I browned the ground beef with chopped onion and garlic.  I used a can of diced tomatoes that had jalapeno peppers mixed in, instead of a separate can of chili peppers.  Omitted the water and added a second can of tomato sauce, and substituted black beans for kidney beans.  The final addition...was a tablespoon or so of brown sugar, instead of the corn water.  As I said, it got raves, and this is definitely a keeper.  Thanks Janeen!",

I also added the dressing and the taco seasoning to the meat before adding to the crock pot.  I tasted the mix before adding water and felt it was too bland, so I added extra cumin and chili powder and a bottle of Mexican beer rather than water.  I think the beer really made a big difference.  I also served with cheese, sour cream, onions, and cheddar-jalepeno beer bread.  I will probably make this again as it was a good start to the chili.",

We topped ours with shredded Colby-Jack and lite sour cream and warmed our tortilla chips on a cookie sheet at 350 for 3-4 minutes for extra crunch and flavor. YUM!!",

Might suggest 1/3 to 1/2 can of jalapenos for the tentative!  Used black beans also...very good!  Cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips a must have!!",
