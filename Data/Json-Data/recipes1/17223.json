I made Bread Bowls from this site today, and was left wondering what to do with the leftover \"insides\".  I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I did not use the food processor, as i didn't have a ton of bread to use, i just crumbled the partially dried bread and put on cookie sheet.  I put in oven at recommended temp, and left for 10-12 minutes, stirring once after 6 minutes.  After they were cooled, I put them in a zip lock bag, and crushed with a rolling pin.  Worked like a charm!!  Thanks Jess for sharing your recipe!!",

I preheated oven put enough to layer my airbake pan tossed in the oven and shut it off. I moved the crumbs around a few times with my hands and just let them sit there with oven light on until they were dried out but not toasted. I did lightly sprinkle and mix in some 'fruit fresh' (it's powdered Vit C) just to ensure some preservation. Anyway...it's basically dehydrating bread crumbs but they work well in place of Panko. I won't be buying those anymore...thanks!",

I just buy a loaf or two of inexpensive, white bread when it's on sale, lay the slices out on my oven racks on low heat until they're completely dried all the way through, break the slices up into my food processor & pulse until they're the desired consistency. I store them in a tightly sealed plastic bag in my pantry. They can easily be seasoned with herbs & spices as needed. Saves me a fortune on store-bought breadcrumbs. For something even easier pulse soda crackers in the food processor.",

As the bread\ncrumbs cool use the paper to shake them then take chicken and bread them on the cookie sheet and stick it back in the oven at 350 for 30- 40 minutes.  If you stick potatoes in the oven when you bake the crumbs.  Now you have a dinner in ann hour. don't need a whole loaf adjust up from for slices. I also add garlic granuales and other seaonings and melted butter to bread crunmbs before I bake the crumbs.",
