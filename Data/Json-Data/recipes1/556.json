I also added an extra 1/4 cup brown sugar. Instead of icing on top I put a marachino cherry in the middle before baking. They look and taste supper yummy! Thanks for the great recipe! Ok new addition! Instead of the extra flour I added oats to make up for the extra moisture! It was delicious! So add an extra 1/2 cup pineapple and 1/2 cup oats and believe me you'll love them!!",

Having only pineapple chunks I put some of the pineapple with a little of the juice in the blender and made a rough puree to use instead of the crushed pineapple. I also substituted pineapple juice for the orange juice and cut the orange zest to 1 tsp. which was more than ample. That kept more of the pineapple flavor. After spreading the glaze on I dipped some in sweetened flaked coconut which added an extra kick of flavor and made for an elegant presentation. These met with great reviews and were hard to stop eating! I'll probably try with raspberry or peach puree to see what happens. Thanks for the recipe!",

However when you use a glaze you don't notice the hint of baking soda taste. I actually used 1 cup of pineapple/juice and added cinnamon which also helped with the taste. For the glaze I used 3T pineapple juice and 1 1/2C of powdered sugar. You could half it if you don't want it on all cookies.",
