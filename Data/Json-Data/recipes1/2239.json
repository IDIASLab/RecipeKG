I used 10 fresh peaches and 1 pint of blueberries. Love that sweet tart combo. I read the hint somewhere on this site to boil peaches for 1 minute then plunge into cold water and the skins slip right off. That tidbit should accompany any fresh peach recipe..I used to stand there and slice and peel each bleepin peach by hand! Never again! Thanks to the cook who posted that tip. I followed other reviewers' advice and used half brown and half white sugar, added cinnamon and nutmeg and 1 Tbsp cornstarch. Rather than layering I just mixed the flour mixture with the peaches, dumped it all into the pie plate and then dropped a few little pieces of butter before putting on the lattice crust. My lattice has never worked out right, but after watching the video on this site my lattice came out great! There is a secret to weaving the strips the right way. Also followed the tip from another cook to leave the pie sitting in the oven after turning it off so it would set. Worked great! All the hints from other cooks have helped me to finally perfect my peach-blueberry pie. Thank-you!",

I took the advice of several other reviews and added 1 heaping TBLSP of corn starch, 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 c of brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar. I did not have any nutmeg so I added 1/4 tsp of Allspice. I did not put the butter in the crumb mixture. I did layer the pie as instructed and then I put 5-6 small plops of butter on top of the last layer( I did not use 1/4 cup of butter as instructed.) I thought this might be a reason why some pies came out runny. I then put my pie crust on top. I used a egg wash and sprinkled the top with sugar and cinnamon. I cooked it for 15 min at 450*, then I turned the oven down to 350 and cooked the remaining time. I turned the oven off and I left it in the oven for about 1-2 hrs to cool down. It was not runny at all. It sliced very nicely and stayed together when putting it onto the plate. It was not dry just the right moisture. The bottom pie crust came out perfect. Not under cooked at all. This is a keeper and I will be making this again. ",
