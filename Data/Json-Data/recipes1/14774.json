These round, flat crispbreads with a hole in the centre, are traditionally used to make open-faced sandwiches topped with butter, thinly sliced cucumber, and deli meats. Or, as a treat, top with smoked or pickled fish such as herring or salmon. It is also served with butter spread on top alongside hot soup.",
