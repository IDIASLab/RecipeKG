Here are the changes I made: added more beef and potatoes than the recipe asked for, and bell peppers and carrots for a more stew taste.  I coated the beef in flour before browning to thicken up the soup.  It was still pretty runny but the broth was so good, nobody was complaining.  If you want to make this more of a stew, you should probably use 4 cups of stock, not 6, and use cornstarch to thicken. UPDATE: I made the same soup today with chicken and chicken stock (instead of beef and beef stock) and substituted cooked rice for the potatoes.  I skipped the browning part and followed the rest of the ingredients and steps per recipe with my original modifications, adjusting the cooking time to the chicken breast (cut up). Excellent flavors!",

Got the perfect consistency for a great stew. The meal was easy to make and it smelled AWESOME while cooking it. However once done I put it over rice and must say other than the first bite this is probably the most bland thing I have ever eaten. I was so disappointed as I wanted a good easy curry dish. And the heat? Nothing there. Next time I'll add a few teaspoons of Cayenne. My recommendation is if you're going to try this you have to add in a lot more spices. This was just too bland for me. The wife liked it however so I'll give it three stars. I don't think I'll be making it again--it just took too long to make to risk having the same result again.",
