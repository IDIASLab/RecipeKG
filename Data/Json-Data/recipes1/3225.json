Next time I will reduce the brown sugar in the oatmeal/flour mixture. I used half whole wheat flour half all purpose flour as other reviewers suggested and thought the texture was perfect. They were very soft when I first pulled them out of the oven but firmed up nicely after cooling for a while. These will work well for throwing in your lunch for a mid-afternoon snack.",

I also used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend in place of regular brown sugar, and Splenda instead of white sugar. To make slightly thinner bars (same taste - smaller portion), I made the recipe in the Pampered Chef large bar pan (about 10\"x16\") instead of in a regular 9\"x13\" inch pan. (Date layer is spread VERY thin to cover this added real estate.) Reduce cooking time to about 30 minutes. The end result: Very tasty! Even picky 6-yr. old really likes them! ",
