After combining the flour & cocoa mixture with milk in the pan it was extremely thick and did not spread well in the pan. Added remainder of ingredients including hot water. Recipe does not state to stir. Chocolate mixture does not look cohesive in the pan. Carefully placed in oven for 35 minutes. After 10 minutes of baking filling overflowed out of the pan. (Yes it smelled bad). Decided to continue to bake until done. There was no sauce to drizzle when I cut pieces.",

Admittedly I let it sit about five-ten mins longer than the recipe said after it came out of the oven but the amount of \"fudge sauce\" on the bottom was just right. Thanks for this easy recipe to address those urgent chocolate cravings.",

If it looks like it will overflow-just put a pan or a piece of foil underneath. It is absolutely delicious with sweetened whipping cream or ice cream!",

The cake itself was pretty good chocolate-y and without being too sweet but with the fudge sauce on top of it? It became overpoweringly sweet for my tastes. Ice-cream or sorbet on top of that? No way! I can see where kids would like it but I don't think I'd make it again for adults without cutting back on the sugar. If you like super sweet cakes you will like this one as is but if your tastes run to the less sweet and more \"tea bread\" style you aren't going to like it.",
