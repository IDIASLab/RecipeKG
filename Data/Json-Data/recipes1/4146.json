After trying these, I have also decided to skip the rolling in sugar step, and just dust the cooled cookies with powdered sugar.  The powdered sugar will nestle nicely into the surface of this cookie!  Even though I made some slight alterations, I give these cookies 5 stars because they are sooo easy to prepare, quick to cook, and are incredibly easy to transport.  It's crisp, yet chewy, allowing them to be packaged in any way.  Mahalo nui loa!\r\n",

We rolled these in a mixture of yellow colored sugar and regular granulated-gave them a nice yellow color with a little sparkle-they are really pretty.  The taste is incredible-so light and refreshing.  You would never guess that there isn't any real lemon in this recipe.  The citrus flavor and the chewy texture of this cookie is fabulous-I will make this over and over!  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.",

Also, if anyone is wondering why there are discrepancies in the reviews as to the texture: if you want a crisp cookie, use lemon extract, not lemon juice.  The acid in lemon juice will react with the baking soda to create a leavening agent, giving you chewy cookies.  But, as others have said, these cookies are quite beautiful =) ",

I made these for a birthday party and rolled them in colored decorator's sugar to match our party colors instead of regular white sugar. If you're pressed for time put the dough in the freezer to chill, only takes about 20 minutes. I'm baffled by other reviewers comments about the cookies spreading too much. My only guess is that their dough wasn't chilled enough or they didn't use real butter. I baked mine about 2 inches apart and had room to spare when they were done.\r\n",

I doubled the lemon extract, added a tsp. of fresh lemon zest, and added several drops of yellow food coloring to the wet ingredients.  I also made my own lemon sugar to roll them in, by adding lemon extract and yellow food coloring to the sugar! I only rolled the top of the cookie, as I didn't want them to be overly sweet.    I didn't have parchment paper, I used cooking-spray and a light dusting of flour on the sheet, and they didn't stick at all.  Also, I only had unsalted butter, so I added 1/4 tsp of salt to the dry ingredients.  My dough was easy to handle after 15 minutes in the freezer. This cookie is delicious, and with the changes I added, is a real keeper.  Thanks for sharing!",

These began to brown pretty quickly, so I decreased the oven temp a few degrees and baked for 10 minutes.  I also made them a little smaller, using rounded teaspoons instead of the larger cookie.  They did spread a little, but the tsp size bakes a perfect tea sized cookie.  These are great!",
