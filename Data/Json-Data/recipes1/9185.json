I made only a couple slight changes: I cooked the chicken breasts in olive oil with Italian seasoning before cutting into pieces. I used herb and garlic feta cheese and sliced olives. The name of the recipe really should be Arti-Cheesy Chicken Pasta as the Penne pasta is not listed in the ingredients and should be. I used approximately 20oz. of Penne pasta. One of my friends recommend that I double the garlic next time. Serve with a side of green salad topped with balsamic vinaigrette.",

I love cooking and although this took quite a bit of time to prepare it was well worth the wait while it was simmering I added 1.5 Tablespoons of italian seasoning and some pepper. The recipe didn't say how to cook your chicken or whether or not to cut it up. I boiled my raw chicken breasts for 20 minutes and cut them into bite size pieces before adding into the recipe anyways this was great and anyone thinking about trying.... SHOULD.:)",
