I compressed everything when measuring and added the flour mixtures in the jar about a \u00bd cup at a time, and there was plenty of room to spare at the top.  Just be sure to watch them in the oven, and check on them... for ours, they were done in aproximately 9-10 minutes.\n\nAlso, if you are making many jars of this recipe, as I did, I found that about four jars takes up roughly one 5 pound bag of flour (with about 1-1/2 C left over) and roughly one 2 pound bag of brown sugar.
