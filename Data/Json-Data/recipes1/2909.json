I did make a couple of minor changes. I cooked a cured ham coated in brown sugar in the oven for the first twenty minutes, then I transferred it to the slow cooker. I used a merlot I had on hand instead of the sangria and added all the liquid to the slowcooker at once, basting the ham every hour or so. When the ham was cooked, I transferred it back to the roaster and strained the remaining liquid into a saucepan. I thickened the liquid on the stovetop with a little cornstarch. This made a lovely burgundy sauce which I used to glaze the ham before I placed it under the broiler for five minutes to make the top shiny and just a little crisp. I served the remaining sauce with the ham.",

Next time I would wait to add the brown sugar until the last hour. I would glaze w/ the wine mixture but the sugar will burn if your ham takes over 2 or 3 hours. My guests said it was picture perfect but I think they were just being nice. It looked burned. Once you cut into it it was perfectly cooked and tasted pretty good. I will try other recipes before I try this one again.",
