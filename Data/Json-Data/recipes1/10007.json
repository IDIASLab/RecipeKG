I cubed the tofu and tossed it with soy sauce cooking sherry red wine vinegar balsamic glaze and salt/pepper. I didn't measure any of these. I then brought water to a boil and added the marinated tofu and cooked for 15 minutes. While it was cooking I coarsely chopped celery onion and water chestnut. Once the tofu was cooked I drained it and added it to the vegetables. I used mayo (because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out) and added more salt to taste. This turned out delicious. I am allergic to eggs but love egg salad. This is the perfect substitue. A couple of changes I may make next time: I love spicy so I may add either horseradish or jalepeno. I will substitue half the mayo with greek yogurt. And I will let the tofu marinate longer. I would also cut the tofu a bit smaller so that it resembles chopped egg more. So the recipe as is will bore you. But it is a great starting point and can please any taste with some tweaking.",
