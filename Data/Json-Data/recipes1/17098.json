I love chocolate and orange together and after reading the recipe I knew to expect a lighter chocolate and orange flavor. With that I began to make the drink. I used half the ice since I don't like icy drinks. I made the rest of the recipe as written. I took a few sips. As other reviewers stated it is rather pulpy and normally I don't mind the pulp but in this drink it just wasn't working. Also the chocolate taste is so faint it is barely there at all. The orange in it is also light so it ends up tasty like icy frothy milk. I found this recipe serves 2.",
