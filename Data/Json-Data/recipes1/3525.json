I left out the celery but doubt that made any difference at all. I do have to say it was a bit greasy so next time I think I'll try ground turkey.I would also suggest especially if you plan on leftovers more broth as the macaroni & rice really suck up the fluid. I like recipes like this because they really give you a lot of room to play. Either way this was a great snowy day dinner!",
