With that said, this is a great recipe.  It was literally my first attempt at baking from scratch and with a few adjustments, I have truly found my carrot cake for life!!  Adjustments I made include:  no coconut (hate'em), 8oz can of pineapple with juice, whole wheat flour instead of white, replace one cup of white sugar with light brown and additional 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla (be sure to use pure vanilla extract, not imitation), add 1 teaspoon of allspice, 1/3 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of sour cream, 2/3-3/4 cup of raisins, and finally, I lightly sauteed my shredded carrots in a bit of unsalted butter, 1/4 cup sugar and sprinkle of cinnamon and set it aside.  I use this with the Cream Cheese II icing on this board (less the unsalted butter used to sautee the carrots).  Several people stated it was the best carrot cake they have ever tasted.  But, more importantly, it had the full combination of flavors I was looking for, nothing overpowered and it had a full, warm taste.  It was a cake I would eat or serve without the icing, but the icing is a perfectly compliment.  Because it suited my particular tastes, I'd give my recipe five stars, but I wouldn't have found mine without yours.  My sincere thanks to you.  Who knew I could bake!!!",

I made one late the other night and the next day while I was at work my mom had the first piece. She called me up and said, \"Angela, don't ever make this again!...I can't stop eating it. This is the best carrot cake I've ever had.\". And believe me, if anybody knows carrot cake, its my mom, its her favorite. Then, I made another for work, and one guy just raved about it. I can't tell you how many compliments this cake gets. And its sooo easy. The batter is ready in 10 minutes (15 if you grate the carrots by hand). Cooking time was right on. It even came out well in one of those cheap alluminun pans you get for like $1.50 at the grocery store. The only thing I changed was I used a 20 ounce can of pineapple in its own juice(although I didn't realize until after the fact, it came out so well, I will continue to use this size). Also, the frosting was delicious, but I used one batch of frosting for both cakes, so if you only make one, start with half the recipe for frosting.",

Says that it rivals his favorite carrot cake recipe.  And he took some to work today and got rave reviews as well!  Here are the modifications I made:  I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, I only used 1/2 cup of canola oil, I used 1 cup regular flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, I used 3/4 cup chopped walnuts AND 3/4 cup chopped pecans, and I added several teaspoons (six or so?) of pineapple juice (from the crushed pineapple) to the frosting.

Also, I made it as a layer cake with 2 8inch pans, and I've never had a cake come out so perfectly even. Try it with this icing instead: 2 blocks cream cheese (8 oz each, has to be regular because low fat itsn't stiff enough), 1/2 cup butter softened (beat with cream cheese until smooth), 2 cups powdered sugar (add gradually), 1 teaspoon vanilla, amaretto to taste.
