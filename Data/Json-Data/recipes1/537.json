I left out the nuts because nobody I know likes nuts. Unless you want the inside of your brownies to be undercooked and gewey I suggest using a larger pan because I had to cook my brownies for twice as long as it said to even though I halved the recipe and the outsides were getting to be too done but it was apparent that the middle was never going to get cooked. But the end result was very fudgey so if you're into that then by all means have batter-filled brownies when you're done. Also I found them difficult to cut because the top would just crack off and leave the brownie itself. It also kind of tasted weird; a lot like fudge. Definately not cakey. But overall it tasted good.",
