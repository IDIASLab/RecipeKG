The first time it was very stringy (used too much of the asparagus bottom) and the second time it had flour lumps in it (make sure flour is desolved before bringing to a boil). I bought the asparagus ready to use (the bottoms cut off) at Trader Joe's. That fixed the stringy problem. I also used a steamer to cook the asparagus (for about 12 minutes) and the onions (threw them in at about 6 minutes). From there, I put that into the blender with 1/2-3/4 c. vegetable broth. Everytime I make it, it's gone by the end of the day. My family loves it and so do my co-workers.",

To make it easier and quicker, I'd recommend chopping the asparagus into small pieces (inch or two is good), and cook veggies with the lid on to reduce evaporation.  Loved it!!",

It's just the $13 Proctor Silex model - nothing fancy - but it saves a bunch of time on this recipe.  After I've steamed the veggies, I take a small bit of the withheld broth, mix it with the flour, salt, pepper, and butter in a pan, and cook the roux.  Then, I simply put the roux in the pot with the veggies, add the milk and extra broth, and use the immersion blender to mix the whole thing up.  It easily purees the veggies.  I add the yogurt and lemon at the very end.  Delicious, and it seems to be as tasty as the original recipe.\n\nMary",
