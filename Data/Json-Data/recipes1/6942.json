I also used about a cup and a half of dried cornbread stuffing mix. I topped both with a drizzle of maple syrup and ketchup and then a half can of fried onions (3 oz) on top. I wrapped them with foil before baking for 1 hour and 15 mintes. I sprinkled the meat mix with coarse ground black pepper and a little bit of Jalapeno Salt. I also added 1/4 cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup of heinz 57 sauce. I added about half of a yellow sweet onion and about 1/2 of a green bell pepper (grinded in a food processor into small pieces) for moisture, I sprinkled about half a can of more french fried onions on each and wrapped each pan in foil before cooking for about 1hour and 15 minutes.  I let them rest for about 30 minutes before serving and they were to die for.  What a great recipe! I will never make \"regular\" meatloaf again!!!  It's fun to experiment with regular recipes and I will tell you that coming from someone who does not always like meatloaf, this was to die for and it is now my NEW meatloaf recipe.",

The only \"wow\" part was \"Igloosgirl\" suggestion to top the meatloaf the the Heinz 57/catsup combo. That little addition made the whole recipe worthwhile.",

And I used a 50/50 combo of ketchup Jack Daniels Honey Smokehouse BBQ sauce. I did use the Worchester making a glaze with it ketchup and the Jack Daniels sauce which I applied when I removed the foil 10 minutes before the \"ding\". I used a 96/4 ground beef which was not at all greasy or messy after using non-stick spray on the loaf pan. Very moist very flavorful and unfortunately we ate it before we could take a picture. My wife suggested we cook a bigger loaf next time so we can get some leftovers out of it!",

So here goes... they say it's \"blah.\" It is. I knew I'd need to doctor this up but the idea of the ranch seasoning and the French fried onions interested me so I plowed ahead. But I should have known better. You couldn't taste the ranch seasoning. You couldn't taste the French fried onions. And there was so MUCH French fried onions coupled with the bread crumbs that this really wasn't meatloaf at all. It was filler with a little meat. And not even inexpensive filler! The French fried onions were nearly 4.00 so you're not really stretching a buck here by using so much filler. The meat was almost an afterthought. And even though I added Worcestershire sauce garlic powder and finely chopped onion and green pepper. even though I even used a combination of ground beef veal and pork and topped it with bacon slices as it baked none of these steps took this meatloaf beyond mediocre. With all this tweaking to improve flavor I can't even imagine what this would have tasted like had I made the recipe strictly as written. In my view this is not meatloaf. It's filler with a little meat.",
