At first I had a bit of a problem with the cookies being flimsy and falling off the stick. I added 1/2 cup extra of flour and this helped. I also used wide wooden craft sticks instead of lollypop sticks. They look great wrapped in colored cellophane and tied with curling ribbon. Very festive and delicious treat!",

                "reviewBody": "Worked great! I made these for my son's sixth birthday to take as treats for school. I didn't have the chocolate candies so I just used semi-sweet chocolate chips. Also I used colored regular size craft sticks intead of lollipop sticks. The perfect size for the dough is using 2 level scoops from a cookie dough scoop. With using this much dough it made 25 cookie pops. I went ahead and inserted the stick before I flattened it. Then I rolled the ball in colored sprinkles to give it some color. After I put the ball with stick on the cookie sheet then I flattened it. I think that putting the stick in before you flatten it is the key to getting the stick to stay in. The first few I made fell apart because I put the stick in after flattening the cookie. Another tip for keeping them together: loosen them from the pan about 1 minute after you take them out of the oven. Then let them sit for about 2 more minutes on the pan before transferring to foil to finish cooling. After the cookies were cool I wrote \"Nick is 6!\" on the stick. Also I tied curling ribbon around the stick. They were adorable!",
