Actually I had to add a tablespoon of evoo to finish frying my chicken (no big deal). Then before I added the spinach I put 1 T of butter in the pan and sauted 2 big cloves of garlic. Then I immediately added the \"wine\" (I used chicken broth instead because I didn't have any wine)and the spinach. I used a whole bag of baby spinach and it was the right amount. My husband liked it my 3 little girls liked it (5 year old kept asking for more cilantro (spinach!) with her chicken!) and I liked it. The sauce is very thin (no big deal to me). I can't wait to email the recipe to my sisters and mother-in-law! Thanks for another great one!",

I also used turkey bacon and possibly because of that didn't have any extra bacon grease with which to cook the chicken--no big deal just added some olive oil. My only suggestion is that you don't have to use that much flour--one cup or one and a half cups would have been enough for the amount of chicken given. I also added some garlic and salt and pepper to the flour before coating the chicken. I served it with green beans parmesan-garlic roasted potatoes and the rest of the bottle of Chardonnay I used to cook with. I think I might try this again with potatoes instead of chicken and use it as a side dish and serve with roasted chicken.",
