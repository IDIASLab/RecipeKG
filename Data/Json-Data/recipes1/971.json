My nephew wanted to bake something when visiting so we chose this and neither of us had tried it before. It had a flavor I have never tasted before of butter pecan mixed with gooey and crispy merengue. I used honey grahams as it didn't specify. Strangely the graham cracker was barely distiguishable in taste which was preferrable. I used sprayed lite whipped cream in a can on top to save time and a little fat. I have never had one of these pies so it was a tad too sweet for me from the cookies but I can see why the other reviewers like it.",

Their butternut brownie pie was my favorite thing. Living in VA now I haven't had it many years. This is easy to make and is just as I remembered. Creamy crunchy rich and delicious. I only made a few changes. I made a German chocolate cake the day before that required 6 egg yolks so I used all six whites in the pie and baked in a 9-inch cake pan and baked just a few minutes longer. Also I remembered when I was a kid and dissected the pie it was made with Ritz crackers instead of graham crackers so I subbed in a sleeve of Ritz. I know the official Lubys recipe says grahams but in the late 70s/early 80s it was Ritz. This was a great treat. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",
