I mixed the cheese, olives, mushrooms and chiles in a bowl (didn't use onion), dipped each tortilla in sauce filled each tortilla with cheese mixture, then spread remaining sauce on top and sprinkled the leftover cheese mixture on top of that.\r\nI made it with the Best Spanish Rice recipe by Angie. (wich is the only one I use)Absolutely delicious! Will add to my favorites.\r\n",

It just takes a minute to grate the cheese, and blocks of cheese are typically much better quality than bags of shredded (often cheaper as well!). When I tried to dip the tortillas they really broke up a lot, so I slathered the sauce on the inside, added the filling, rolled it up, and then poured the remaining sauce over the enchiladas, making sure not to leave any naked tortilla. This was a lot easier!",

We made a few adjustments to the original recipe, like using canned red enchilada sauce vs. making our own and using flour tortillas vs. corn (personal preference).  It was wonderful!  The mushrooms, particularly, were delectable in this dish.  This recipe seems very easy to modify to your personal tastes (adding different vegetables and cheeses), and it's perfect for vegetarian Mexican fare.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I use canned enchilada sauce but thicken it by by stirring equal parts flour and butter (usually a Tablespoon each per can of sauce)over medium heat until flour is golden brown.. Add enchilada sauce and continue to stir over medium heat until thickened. My family prefers flour tortillas. This recipe freezes well and can be popped in the oven straight from the freezer. tTo cook frozen enchiladas over with foil and increase baking time to 45-60 minutes. Remove foil during last 10 minutes of baking.",
