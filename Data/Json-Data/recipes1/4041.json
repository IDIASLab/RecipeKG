I changed a few things because I didn't have everything listed. I upped the cinn. to 1 tsp. and omitted the cloves allspice walnuts and raisins. I also added 2 eggs instead of one and used cinn. applesause because that's all I had on hand. I added about 4 fresh cubed macintosh apples and I didn't have the ingredients for the frosting so I coated the top with confectionary sugar. It was a big hit!!! I am making another one today and I am planning on using the frosting this time. Thanks for the great recipe!!",

I did make some changes which are significant and in my opinion enhanced the flavor. I used two eggs substituted milk for water and butter for shortening. I also used a tsp of vanilla. I did add a tsp more of cinnamon and didn't have either cloves or allspice so I used 1 tsp of apple pie seasoning - delish! I also left out the raisins and nuts and substitued about 1.5 cups of finely diced Macintosh apples. I dusted the top with powdered sugar and it was just perfect - without frosting. Excellent basic cake recipe! Thanks so much for sharing - it was very close to the cake I had recently in Colonial Williamsburg Virginia.",
