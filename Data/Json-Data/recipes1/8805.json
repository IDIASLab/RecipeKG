I use 1 thing of cream cheese not 2 and I would also use instead the imitation crab meat as opposed to the meat in the can it is a better taste and texture and I use more like 10 oz of it. add in 2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning and 1 tsp of hot pepper sauce and some finely minced red pepper. Pipe it out using a baggy with a cut corner onto cucumber slices to counteract the spiciness and you will have a great appetizer.",

I have to agree with someone else who said there may be too much cream cheese though. The amount of mixture this recipe makes far-exceeds the amount I could ever stuff into 15 small phyllo cups. And the cream cheese was good but I think it stole some of the seafood flavor from it. I will use less cream cheese next time. Also I sprinkled Old Bay seasoning on top instead of cocktail sauce which was tasty. And I took someone else's advice and baked the cups for 3 - 4 minutes to take the chill off before serving. I will definitely make these again thanks Jill!!",
