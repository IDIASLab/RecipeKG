I think the trick is depending on what type of caramel you use. Kraft makes caramels that can be eaten as candy or used for baking. You can find them in the candy aisle inside Wal-mart. I mixed all the dry ingredients together first so that it blended evenly with the apples. It came out a little runny but I added a little more flour to thicken it up. My guess was the lemon juice thinned it out quiet a bit. Next time I am going to add the lemon juice to the apples let it soak for a few minutes drain half the excess and then incorporate the dry mixture. Another thing the recipe calls for 6cups of apples. I used Granny Smith and five (2.5 lbs) of them made approx 6cups.",

I served this to four other people and they LOVED it!! Word to the wise: Definitely stick with the caramel squares and if you can't find any wait until you do. I tried to substitute them with caramel sauce--the kind in the jar--and althought it still tasted delicious it was a HUGE mess to cook. I had to throw out a cookie sheet and clean out my oven (which was in awful need of a cleaning anyway I just needed that extra push to do it! lol) because the sauce basically turned to water and spilled out of the pie. I bought two frozen extra deep pie crusts. I took one and flattened it cut out long strips and criss-crossed them over the top. The pie looked GORGEOUS. It was like something out of a cookbook. People raved about how pretty it was almost as much as they raved about the taste. Excellent desert if you're looking to casually impress.",
