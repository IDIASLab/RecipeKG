I knew going in this was going to have too much rice so I prepared HALF the amount called for in advance in chicken broth and held it aside until I was ready to just add it to the soup at the end. I added mushrooms carrots and celery to the sausage to give this some color and substance and they were great contributions. I added the rice at the end then stirred in the cream and... I was still disappointed. It could have been creamier for one thing. And all those herbs just floated to the top and looked very unattractive; so unattractive that I skimmed most of it off and the soup was much improved particularly in its appearance. We both liked the final result but it traveled a long way in the process to get to that point.",
