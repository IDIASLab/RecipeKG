I think this one is even better the next day, moist and more lemony.  Next time, I will make it the day before serving. Good & easy!",

For those of you who thought the cake was a bit too sweet you may want to try using lemon flavored pudding mix instead of gelatin. I took a box of D.H. french vanilla cake mix and added four eggs 2/3 C oil 1 C buttermilk (no water) and instead of lemon extract and gelatin I used the rind of one lemon about four Tbsp. of fresh juice and about half a package of lemon-flavored pudding as well as two heaping scoops of sour cream. This 'softened' the lemon flavor and didn't taste too sweet. Lemon tends to amplify sugar in any recipe so I say to cut down on the tartness in the cake and just keep the glaze really sweet. This was basically a lemon-flavored pudding/pound cake that was sooo moist and very good with the simply lemon glaze on top.",

I would love to be able to make everything from scratch but then we would never eat around here! This cake is AWESOME!!! I always get a little worried when trying a new recipe in case it is all hype and doesn't deliver. This delivers. Don't know why anyone would rate it not good unless they did something wrong. Of course I made some slight changes. No extract - fresh lemon juice (4T). Used the DH Classic Yellow mix instant lemon pudding. I was a little worried it wouldn't be lemony enough when I tested the batter. Not to worry. Also for the icing used just the lemon juice and confec. sugar (mix well) and added lots of pulp and about 1-2t of zest. It is a runny icing so SLOWLY drizzle. Made it the night before as a bundt cake for an afternoon meeting the next day. SO MOIST. Very lemony. The icing seeped into the cake and amazing. It's all gone! I think that I would try it with lemon cake mix to see if that made it even better but not sure. It pretty well rocks! Did I say I liked the cake?? Don't know why the icing in the photo on the site is so white though. Mine didn't look that way. You should give this a try.",
