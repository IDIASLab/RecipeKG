I made without the corn because I didn't have any, but don't make any substitutions or leave out anything else, the flavors just blend to make a wonderful soup/stew. I also simmer my soup longer than the recipe calls for. Since the macaroni tends to get too mushy if you have lots of leftovers,or have to keep it simmering for awhile. I cook and drain the pasta and just add a little to each bowl as I serve it. Then refrigerate the leftover pasta and soup in seperate containers. This is so great and different from stew or chili. I made it when I had out of town guests flying in and wasn't sure when they would arrive. They got to our home and were so happy to be met with the delightful smell and be served this satisfying and hearty soup with french bread and a fresh fruit salad after a long and hungry flight!",

This soup was sooo good!\r\nMy family enjoyed it. A definite keeper! I did take the advice of previous postings and added 3 extra cups of water. Because of the extra water I decided to add more beef bouillon and increase the oregano and basil to a little over 1 tbsp. each. I used Italian Stewed tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes, 2 cups of frozen vegetables (corn, peas and green beans) instead of the can veggies, and I skipped the cabbage altogether. I also took the advice of cooking the macaroni separately and adding them to the bowl just before serving.  Very filling and oh so good :)\r\n",
