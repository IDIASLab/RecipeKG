I followed the recipe as written but I added a couple of handfuls of chocolate chips. Was looking for something to sandwich homemade ice cream in between. They worked great for that. They are a little dry on their own. You do need to flatten them because they do not flatten on their own.",

I am a true chocoholic and didn't really believe a chocolate cookie without chocolate chips could be so good but boy was I wrong! I used a small cookie scoop covered the cookie sheet with the cookie balls and then went back and lightly flattened each one with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar. I also took some of them to work and my coworkers thought they were awesome too! TRY THEM NOW!!!!!!! Thank you so much for this recipe!!",
