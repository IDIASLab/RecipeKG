I  add garlic, black pepper, (just a dash)   and a couple of tablespoons of Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce. AND a little more salt.  Use a heavy beer--no lite stuff--  It REALLY helps the flavor--gives it more depth.   After a couple of different cuts of beef, I've found a siroin tip roast to be the best.    Also if you let it cool a few minutes before slicing and add back to the juices for a while, it is much more flavorful.  I love the buttered rolls with the au jus---melt provolone cheese under the broiler--yum!",

It took me 5 minutes to throw everything into the cooker.  When I came home I sliced it up and put it back into the juice for another hour.  I buttered the rolls and added shredded mozzarella cheese and threw them under the broiler until the cheese melted.  This was a huge hit.  My family loved it.  Not at all dry.

Even though it may not slice well, I believe it has superior flavor and is really well suited to slow cooking. It shreds up nicely, and is easy to spoon onto rolls for sandwiches. I use Guiness Draught, tho' I'm sure most any beer would work well, and I also add a few shakes of garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce.",

When the meat was ready to be sliced I took it out and sliced it very thin and even shredded a few pieces, then put the meat back in the crockpot for 30 more minutes to soak into the juice.. I didnt put butter on our french bread, instead I toasted it with some shredded mozarella on it... The juice is so good and it smelled so good while it was cooking.. While I was slicing the meat my husband was eating it right out of the crockpot!!!...LOL..He has already requested it for next weekend when we have friends coming over..\r\n\r\nKiki (Brampton,On Canada)",

                "reviewBody": "FANTASTIC! MUCH better than any French dip recipe I've tried (including Giselle's French dips, another popular AR recipe). I waited quite a while to try this for 2 reasons. First, I had such a mediocre experience w/ Giselle's recipe, I wasn't in any hurry to make French dips again. Second, I thought these would be SUPER bland. Boy, was I wrong! :) Having said this, I did make a few minor changes. I rubbed my roast w/ .5 t ea. garlic / onion salt & pepper & added 1 T W sauce / .5 t of minced garlic to my crockpot. My beer of choice was 1554 (a dark ale made by New Belgium Brewing Co. - the same company that produces Fat Tire). I used plain 'ol beef broth, but next time I'm gonna use beef consomme (it's more concentrated / stronger). There are a couple of things to note: First & foremost, use a DARK beer. A stout or dark ale is perfect. Light beers will leave you w/ weak au jus. Next, a rump roast is also referred to as a bottom round roast. A chuck roast will also work, but will make your au jus greasy (it's a fatty cut of meat) & won't slice nicely (it's great for shredded dips). Finally, remove your meat, allow to rest for 10 min. & thinly slice / add back to the sc for ~ an hr. (to soak up the flavor of the au jus). Homemade onion rolls (claudygirl) toasted w/ garlic butter, piled w/ provolone / sauteed onions, spread w/ horsey sauce, broiled & served w/ au jus made for AWESOME samies. :-) I bet leftover au jus will be a GREAT base for French onion soup!
