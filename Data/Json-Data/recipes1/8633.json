If you are using this method give your potatoes and carrots more than 15 minutes as the soup is very thick and simmering doesn't cook the veggies enough in just 15 minutes. I subbed 1 t. tarragon for the chervil (I don't care for chervil.) It did require A LOT of thinning down. It was okay. Nobody objected to eating it. But the flavor wasn't anything special. I think I could tweak it to make it more to my taste but I didn't like it well enough to try. The potatoes and carrots do give it a nice substance though. If you are a fan of pea soup give it a try. (I can't imagine this being a kid's favorite though. My kids were not picky eaters but I'm sure they would not have cared much for this soup as children!)",
