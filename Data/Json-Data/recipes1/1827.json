I took the advice of some other reviewers regarding the mint filler and used about 2 tablespoons of milk a teaspoon of peppermint extract about 2 tablespoons of additional powdered sugar and some green food coloring instead of the creme de menthe. Turned out super. Also for the other folks who are in a hurry like I was my cake wasn't entirely cooled I only chilled the mint layer for about 15 minutes before adding the chocolate and chilling for only about another 1 1/2 hours. Turned out fabulous. Thank you!",

About the only difference is I use a few drops of peppermint extract in place of the creme d\u00e9 menthe. I also add a couple drops of either green or red food coloring. I don't let mine chill more than about 45 mins. or the top tends to crack easily when you are trying to cut it. Also I divide the pan into about 4 sections saving one to eat immediately and the other 3 are cut up and put on paper plates then in plastic freezer bags. They freeze nicely and thaw quickly when you are looking for a quick dessert or have someone drop in unexpectedly. I try to keep a couple plates in the freezer at all times.",

I made so many mistakes( over beating the butter till it seperated for both batter and icing) and I was amazed that the cake still turned out yummy! I used one teaspoon of mint extract and that worked great. TO salvage my cake I placed it in the freezer and it still tasted fudgey and moist! granted the cake layer isn't the most chocolatey the whole combination worked really well. It was like eating Andes Mint or After Eight mint cakes! A real keeper!",

The only thing I did differently is to drizzle the chocolate glaze very heavily over the top of the mint layer as opposed to spreading it. For my ladies luncheon I wanted more of the green to show because I thought it made a beautiful presentation. Spreading the glaze would have give it a chocolate cake look. BTW the chocolate glaze is more of a frosting that sets up hard and has a tendency to crack. For this reason too I think a heavy drizzle pattern would be better than spreading. Thanks Sally!",

It cut cleanly and neatly. Although this was very good (actually I had a hard time stopping eating it) I only gave it 4 stars because in the past I've made a similar recipe with a brownie base and I prefer that since it's more chocolatey than this cake.",
