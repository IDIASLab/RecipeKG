This pie was easy to make, I followed the recipe very closely, except I added a little bit of melted butter to the mixture and cooked each pie for about 55-60 mins each at 350. I also added a foil ring to the crust so it didn't get too brown. I highly recommend this recipe to other egg pie lovers, it's so very tasty and doesn't have that \"too much egg\" taste like others.",

I did not have one that was wider than 9\" so there were some issues in technicality with this recipe for me. Some water did seep into the pie pan trying to balance it in. And the lowest layer came out harder than the rest. However the top layer did taste fairly good. I would definitely have to go buy a new baking dish for the water bath to even begin to think about trying this again.",
