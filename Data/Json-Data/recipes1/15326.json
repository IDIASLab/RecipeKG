At high altitudes a double boiler is not necessary, just don't over cook it or it will harden/dry out faster, keep it covered until ready to use. Any flavoring can be used in place of vanilla, and juice can be used instead of the water for an orange or lemon frosting, using zest in place of the vanilla, also you can stored this frosting in the fridge for at least a week in an air tight container.
