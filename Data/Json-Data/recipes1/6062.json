I did run my cottage cheese through my tiny food processor before adding it to the mix only because I knew it wouldn't have made it past my husband if I hadn't. I made it a little more \"us\" with some garlic powder/onion powder/dried dill weed/fresh ground pepper and a dash or two of Frank's hot sauce as well as a couple of garlic dills that I chopped. Because I do not have celery salt on it's own I used Beau Monde seasoning. Very very good. We all thought this was just mighty tasty AND it was great for using up half of a container of cottage cheese. NOTE: I did use \"trim\" cottage cheese and reduced fat mayonnaise.",
