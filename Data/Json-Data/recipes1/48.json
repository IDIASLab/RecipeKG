Then I baked them on 375 degrees for 5-6 minutes. The toffee melts into the cookies better at a higher temperature and when you take them out they will look undercooked. Let them sit for 5 minutes then transfer to a cookie rack. They turn out so much more soft and gooey inside! Thanks for the great recipe.",

I needed these in a pinch and I knew that a mix would make them um sort of instant flavored. But in all fairness we are rating the \"taste\" of the cookie and they seemed salty and chem-flavored to me. I did appreciate the SPEED of this option. I wouldn't bake them for people I love.
