Some people had difficulty getting them out of the pan and my advice would be to use shortening (like crisco) to grease the pan and then dust well with flour. Make sure your eggs are room temperature when you start and not right out of the fridge our they will grow and froth up too much. Other hints... oh i tapped the pan on the counter instead of using a knife to loosten and they just fell right out. Good luck!",

I am not sure if that's why it turned out so bad but the madeleines were very airy impossible to get them out the pan. We had to eat them out of the pan spooning out anything we could get. It tasted ok that wasn't the problem....just the fact that it was impossible to get them out and not at all the texture of what madeleines should be. Maybe it is just impossible to make them using pastry flour so if you are someone like me who only use pastry flour (whole grain soft wheat flour high in fiber) do not try this recipe. Pastry flour always worked for my cakes and muffins even cookies but I guess not for madeleine. Stick to all purpose flour and as everyone else recommends make sure you really butter and flour the pan. I thought I had done a pretty good job but apparently not!",

I made them plain sifted some confectioners sugar over some and dipped the tips of others in a homemade maple frosting. YUM!",

I filled my pan a little bit more that 3/4 way full but they still came out the perfect size and shape. Also I would suggest not using a knife to take them out of the pan. If you grease and flour correctly once cooled they will fall right out if you just tap the edge. I also found that baking mine for 10 minutes made them too crunchy and brown on the outside and a bit too dry for my taste. For a spongier softer Madeleine reduce the baking time to eight minutes. They will still be brown around the edge but be light yellow in color on the top. I love this recipe! On my second batch right now!",
