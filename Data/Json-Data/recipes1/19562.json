I didnt have the fresh dill but used dried instead and a shake of terragon.  Turned out great with the  dried herbs.  So if you dont have the fresh dill dont pass this one over for that reason, just used the dried.  I did cut the dried back a bit.  Added a tiny bit of finely chopped green onion to the dressing for an extra kick of flavor.  Also used a combo of salad shrimo and immitation crab because that is what I had on hand.  This recipe lends itself to lots of variety.  Definitely a keeper!",
