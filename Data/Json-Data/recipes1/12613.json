I used a little extra lemon juice (close to 4 tablespoons) and thought the pie was the perfect balance of sweet and tart. I also used reduced fat cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk and the recipe turned out well. Note: I never make non-instant pudding and did not realize that it requires the addition of sugar and egg yolks (at least the brand I made did). I am so used to making instant pudding and just adding milk make sure to have any necessary pudding ingredients on hand. Also the recipe makes a lot of filling. My market offers larger graham crusts ten servings instead of the regular eight. I would get that next time.",

I got the 10-serving pie shell and (oops!) 2-pkgs of 2.9 oz pudding so I used 1-1/2 pkgs. Really important to cook the pudding until it is super thick and boiling. I used about 1 tsp of zest while stirring the pudding and 4-1/2 Tbsp of fresh lemon juice for the stir-in. Having the crm cheese at room temp was a great suggestion and I ended up using about 3/4 of the can of cond milk. Chilled overnight this pie set up really well. It was devoured in under 5 minutes--it took me longer to serve it than it took my family to eat it! Kids loved this too:-)Next time I will use reg whipping cream instead of cool whip as I never defrost that stuff the right way. The pie is actually superb without any topping at all. It was a great wrap up to our Memorial Day BBQ.",

The amount of tartness and lemon flavor is personal fortunately this recipe works if you add extra lemon juice. I loved the hints from a previous reviewers: Bring the pudding to a full boil cubing/softening the cream cheese and mixing in some of the thawed topping. The second time I made an altered recipe. I used two (2.9oz) packages instead of one large (4.3oz) package. While the pudding was thickened but still boiling hot I took it completely off the stove (instead of turning the heat to low) and add the softened and cubed cream cheese mixing it in with a hand mixer. I added an extra 4 ounces (making a total of 12oz) of cream cheese which made it so creamy delicious. I added more lemon juice for a total of 1 cup of lemon juice. After the condensed milk and lemon juice were mixed in I added one (8oz) container of completely thawed whipped topping. I used a hand mixer to get everything completely mixed together. After pouring the filling into the graham cracker pie crusts and refrigerating the pies were set in less than an hour. When ready to serve I topped with additional thawed whipped topping. The additional cream cheese lemon juice and whipped topping made enough filling for three purchased graham cracker crusts. Like the first pie made with the original directions these pies set up beautifully and have the perfect texture and lemony tartness I crave.",
