Put the chicken in a glass 13x9x2\" dish at 350 for 35 minutes.  Perfect!  I would omit the extra basting at the end - I think the marinade was a tad heavy on the salt (which was in the miso paste), so adding more at the end was a little bit much for my taste.  Will definitely make again though.  Thanks for the recipe!",

Overall the chicken was fine but after chilling for 11 hours in a sea of yummy marinade the flavor didn't quiet permiate well and the sugar burned during cooking.
