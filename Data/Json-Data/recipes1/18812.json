This was VERY rich and heavy with a nice smokey flavor from the cheese. I used tortellini in place of the ravioli. I served this as a side dish and it was a little too heavy for what I served it with. So it might be better as a main course. I do think I would like it a little better if it had some veggies or something else to tone down the richness a bit. Other than that it was good but I may have to change it up a little next time that I make it. Thanks for the recipe!",
