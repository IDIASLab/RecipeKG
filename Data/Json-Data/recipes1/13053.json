My family has requested these at every  baby and bridal shower until I have gotten sick of making them and even eating them. The only difference in the way I make them and this is that I cook them longer. They really need to cook for up to 25 minutes. Otherwise you end up with raw sausage in the middle. I have tried different brands of sausage and it makes a difference. Some are greasier than others and some are drier. And I have found that Aberdeen sausage (spelling?) (it may be Aberdeen Farms) works the best. You can find it at walmart and it usually is the cheapest. If the ones on the edge of your pan end up dry just put all the sausage balls in a covered container and let them sit covered until they cool. The steam will help the dry ones become moist. I always cover mine to cool to hold in the flavor even if they don't dry out because it seems to make them taste even better if the flavors mingle.",

However, I had to change the baking a bit.  The first batch I made came out SOO greasy (of course using uncooked sausage), even after laying them on a paper towel to drain and cool.  I took my cooling rack and placed it on a cookie sheet, then put the unbaked sausage balls on that.  When they cooked, the grease dripped down through the cooling rack into the pan below.  Because of the drippings, you will need to get a spatula to get them off the rack, but cooking them this way they have yet to burn!!  I cooked them for 25 minutes or so instead of 10 minutes like the recipe says.  After cooking them like this, my husband tasted them and said they were the best tasting sausage balls he had ever had.  My children ate them as fast as I was making them!!  I will be cooking them this way from now on.  We had these for Thanksgiving appetizers this morning!!  :)",

I left the sausage out for about 20 min. before starting the recipe and finely grated the cheddar cheese by hand... those were the two best ideas from the reviews. Then you really have to get in there with your hands (those disposable thin kitchen gloves work great for this part) and knead the dough. It was kind of fun actually :)  Also, as many reviewers have suggested, line your baking sheets with parchment. I had no sticking whatsoever. Finally, my own suggestion is to bake them longer than 10 min... I baked mine about 20 min., flipping them over after 10 min. This could partly be my oven's fault, but I'd say you'd at least want to bake for 15 min. There's nothing worse than an undercooked sausage ball... yuck! Anyway, the final results were very yummy and I've got a lot left over in the freezer ready and waiting for Superbowl Sunday!!!",

                "reviewBody": "This is the recipe I've used for 20+ years, adding another good handful more of cheddar. I can't believe some recommend to cook the sausage before mixing. No, you do NOT cook the sausage first! Your sausage balls will be dry and lacking the flavor the grease gives them during baking. Just toss them in a paper-towel lined bowl to absorb any excess grease afterward. If you use nice sausage (it really is worth a buck or two more), you won't have the super greasy problem to begin with. If you live in the southeast, look for Neese's Hot Sausage (the BEST!). Failing that, Jimmy Dean is fine (don't go lower in quality than that, tho). Set the ingredients out an hour ahead of time. You have to use some muscle to get it totally blended. You'll know it's ready when you can smoosh it into one big old smooth mass that isn't crumbly or dry.  DON'T add liquid if it seems dry - that isn't the problem! The warmth of your hands and the kneading will do the trick. Just keep at it; it'll end up just right. I make mine large-marble size (ends up walnut size after baking) and cook about 15 mins. This is THE recipe to try. Don't use tons of baking mix or add liquids like some recipes call for. Use parchment/silpat; the bottoms won't over-brown or stick. For heaven's sake - whatever you do - DO NOT precook the sausage! :)",
