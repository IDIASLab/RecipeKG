Regardless of using cooking spray on the pan...they were glued to the pan. I had to pry them off in chunks. I didn't end up w/ a single whole cookie. Threw them all in a bowl and just grab chunks here and there to eat. I dunno what's wrong w/ this recipe but it def didn't work!",

These cookies are the right mixture of crunchy and chewy at the same time. I love these as do my kids. I did however only have a cup of oats so added maybe an 1/8 to 1/4 cup more flour. I also used half a bag of butterscotch chips and half a bag of semi-sweet choc. chips instead. This recipe made a whole lot more than just 24 cookies. Even after me and my kids ate quite a bit of dough it made 60 cookies. I would recommend this recipe for sure! Will definitely make this for a family get together.",
