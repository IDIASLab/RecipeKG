I can tell you I never was a fan of potato salad until I started making my own and then it was over from there. It really does come down to personal preferances and it's really personal, really. Because we wanted a tamer onion flavor, I used green onion. I used dill pickles instead of sweet as we don't care for sweet pickles, and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. After mixing the potato salad ingredients, I found that mine needed more mayo. Not much, maybe a little under another quarter cup? I added chopped chives, onion powder and a couple good shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce to my potato salad as that's what I always add to all my potato salad--it's a family favorite. Nice basic potato salad that we all enjoyed.",
