I allow the chops to come to room temp, and lightly sift and pat in a coating of flour on them prior to frying, shaking off any excess. Follow the balance of instructions exactly.

A hint: when carmelizing your onions, let them sit in the pan and cook; don't be tempted to stir them up every minute as they won't carmelize well.  It takes a while to get the right color so be patient.  I let my onions go about 25 minutes to get the right color and consistency, only moving them around maybe once every four to five minutes.  Another excellent recipe; thanks very much Chef John.",

I used one large and one small onion (thinly sliced), 3 glove garlic, 1-1/3 c. broth, 3 tbsp. flour, 3 tbsp. buttermilk, and 3 tbsp. water. The consistency was perfect. I also added about 1 tsp. of thyme because I'd seen it mentioned in so many other recipes. It adds a nice touch but (honestly) the recipe is fine without it. For those who don't have buttermilk on hand, not to worry: neither did I. I poured 1/4 c. milk into my measuring cup, then added about a tbsp. of apple cider vinegar and let it sit. Even at that I had to toss some of it out, but it was worth the extra (albeit minimal) effort: it adds a nice tang to the gravy. Finally, I used a cast iron dutch oven to make this in because ... well, I'm gaga for cast iron. I think it adds to whatever you use it for. This is for sure a keeper. Thank you, John!",

Which is an important step for this sauce. It had lots of rich, full flavor. The only modification I made was for the poultry seasoning I used Adolph's Seasoned tenderizer since my family doesn't like regular poultry seasoning.  The spice set is perfect for this recipe.  It has garlic powder in it but I sprinkled a little more on the chops before searing them; no need to salt since Adolph's has salt in it or you could just use garlic powder, onion powder and salt instead.  If you plan on serving over rice, pasta or even potatoes, for that matter, you might want to consider increasing the sauce to 50% more since it didn't make quite as much as we wanted. The sauce is wonderful! I served over some ridged elbow pasta with fresh steamed green beans sauteed in a little olive oil, fresh minced garlic, kosher salt and freshly grated black pepper. The chops were gobbled up with a definite request for this one to be a regular in our house. It will replace my another smothered pork chop recipe I've been making for years.  Thanks Chef John for another fabulous recipe!!",
