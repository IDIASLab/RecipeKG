I didn't have any saltines so I used club crackers instead and it was wonderful, in fact, they probably made it more buttery and rich...delicious!  I recommend you leave the bones and skin in the salmon, they are very soft, and you will never know you are eating them.  You can easily \"smush\" them up, if you want, but they are so full of calcium and protien you really should leave them in.  Also, I added chopped onions and celery for a little zest! Give this recipe a try!!!",
