I used a 16-oz container of Egg Beaters instead of the eggs to save on fat and cholesterol. I just poured the egg substitute mixture into my new ceramic-lined skillet, popped it into the oven, and it cooked perfectly at 25 minutes.  After baking, it slid right on to a plate with no sticking whatsoever (and I saved one dirty dish).  Next time, this omelet will travel from Denver to Mexico because I plan to add some jalape\u00f1o and serve with salsa, sour cream, and some chopped cilantro.  Wouldn't hesitate to serve this to company for brunch (or lunch as I did today).*****UPDATE 3.1.17***** We never tire of this recipe, such a winner and so easy!  Did a little Mexican spin on it today by adding chopped cilantro and some red pepper flakes to the omelet itself and garnishing it with salsa, sour cream, shredded cheddar, and jalape\u00f1os.  Delicious, as always!",

I make it in a deep cast iron fry pan cooking shredded potatoes until nice and crisp, then adding eggs etc. and put in oven. After it sets, I top with more cheese, red & yellow thin sliced bell peppers and let finish. Oma used to call it a FARMERS BREAKFAST and so do I. Fresh spinach and other fresh veggies mixed into the mixture is fantastic, let your tastebuds guide you! Be aware though that mixture will at least double in size, so make sure you have a VERY DEEP fry pan or fry potatoes first, layer them on bottom of deep baking dish and add rest of stuff, works as well!",

I scaled this down to 1 serving (2 eggs) and I minced my pepper and onion very tiny before cooking so I wouldn't encounter large icky pieces of it while eating. I used smoked dinner ham and I do think using a good quality and flavor of ham makes a difference in this dish. I was really not expecting to like this but trying to expand my food boundaries, and hesitantly took a bite. Oh. My. Goodness. My mouth is in heaven. I devoured this whole thing and it was fabulous to the last bite. This turned out moist and not at all dry like I thought. I didn't have the proper size baking dish so I lined a pie plate with aluminum foil and bent it up to make a small foil \"boat\" in the size I needed. I still can't believe how delicious this dish was!!! Thanks for sharing and I am soo glad I tried this.",
