First I don't use a graham cracker crust instead I make my own flour pie crust. I also add a handful of chopped pecans to the cream cheese mixture along with 1 pkg dissolved unflavored gelatin (without the gelatin the pie does not set well and falls apart when serving). I pour the mixture into the baked and cooled crust and refrigerate it overnight. The next day I mix 1 lb. of strawberries with strawberry glaze and cover the entire pie with it. Right before serving I make fresh whipped cream by beating heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla and I pipe it on to the top of the entire pie. Finally I sprinkle it with a little toasted coconut and chopped pecans and... fabulous! This usually costs me about 7 to make (I only make it when I can get the ingredients on sale) & the restaurant pie we usually buy costs 14 and we can't brag that it's homemade!",

Based on some of the other reviews I made the following changes: used a 9\" cake pan (deeper) made my own graham crust used a six serving size pudding mix and the whole tub of cool whip; I also put this in the freezer for about three hours and then transferred it to the fridge for the remaining few hours before serving. This set up and served very well. I think next time though I will just put the coconut (untoasted maybe?) right into the pie mixture and use a little more pineapple. This pie was really easy to make and made for an excellent summer dessert.",
