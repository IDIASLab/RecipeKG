Cream shortening or butter with sugars until smooth and creamy. Then add eggs and mix well again, then other liquids and mix well. Mix all dry ingredients in a separate bowl and then add 1/3 or less at a time to the wet ingredients and that's how great cookies are made, as well as all muffins and quick breads too! The old cookbooks used to explain this, but, alas, that info isn't included anymore and new bakers don't have this info. My daughter just made this same mistake because the recipe she used didn't give step by step info like they used to! No matter what the recipe says, this is always (in my experience) the way to perfect baking! I hope this helps!! Great recipe otherwise!!!",

Not a fan of using that much shortening so I used 1 cup shortening 1 stick of butter and it turned out sooo good. Once the shortening/egg mixture cools it does get pretty stiff so using an electric mixer with a dough hook is ideal or else you'll get a nice work out. I chilled my dough for only 2 hours and it was plenty. This dough crinkles beautifully and this recipe makes a lot of cookies. I used walnut sized dough balls and yielded a little over 3 dozen. I tested my oven with a thermometer to check the temperature accuracy and it was. 375 degrees at exactly 9 minutes made soft chewy cookies. Will be my master recipe from now on. Rivals the bakery ones - and so easy to make.",
