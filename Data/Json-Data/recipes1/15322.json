I added 1/3 c. powdered sugar towards the end b/c I thought it tasted a bit too bitter. I also let the butter come to room temp. before creaming it in a separate bowl and then adding it to the frosting. I recommend frosting the cake while the frosting is at room temp. After I chilled the frosted cake the frosting was so stiff I don't know how I would've spread it. It also didn't make quite enough to spread between three layers and the top so next time I may just make it a double layer cake. Also goes great with pecans. This is the first time I've made a frosting that was mainly eggs instead of the powdered sugar moisture kind. Very delicious I will definitely make it again.",

You have to make sure that your eggs don't cook or else you'll have scrambled eggs in your frosting. I put mine through a strainer before adding to the chocolate. Put your eggs and chocolate in your mixing bowl at the same time. The butter needs to melt that too can cause lumps. Then you have to put it in the freezer and wait wait wait until it is the proper consistency. This was tasty but I'm not sure that it was worth the effort. It is very rich so don't put a lot on any cake.",
