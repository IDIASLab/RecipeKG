My house smelled like a beautiful flower after I made this cake. The texture was at once crumby and velvety-moist. I added a little bit of extra apricot brandy and I put the full teaspoon of the lemon and orange extracts even though I halved the recipe in all other respects. I can totally picture someone like Emily Post serving this cake at a 50's dinner party! I will definitely make it again!",
