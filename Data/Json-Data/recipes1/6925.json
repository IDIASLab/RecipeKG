One note though: If you like a full pie you may want to double (or 1 1/2 times) the recipie I find that the regular recipie is a little scant.",

Additionally please use an electric mixer on high to make the egg topping. It will take at least 8-10 min of beating. My client was thoroughly pleased. His pie was my second run-through.",
