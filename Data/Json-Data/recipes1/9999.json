I used an 8oz can of tomato sauce, worchester sauce and a packet of lipton onion soup mix instead of salt, pepper and flour mixture.  I also used a bag of frozen mixed veggies instead of canned green beans.  the meat didn't have as much sauce to it as I would have liked, so next time I will some water to make it a bit juicier.  Made the mashed potatoes with milk, sour cream and mustard.  Got rave reviews from my whole family... even my 18 month old!  will definitely make again!",

First instead of using two cans of greenbeans,I used one can of beans and one can of corn. As for the garlic, I chopped six cloves of garlic and added it to the ground beef just before it was completly browned.I also added some onion at the same time. I'll make this stuff time and time again. Wonderful.",

Made again with the following changes and got a WOW from my bf: diced 1med onion and sweat in 2 tblsp olive oil. cook until translucent & add 2 tbsp minced garlic. cook for 2-3 minutes. Add 2lbs ground beef sirloin, parsley, salt and pepper and brown, drain excess.  Add 15oz tomato sauce, 1 can peas, 1 can green beans, 1 can corn, mix together.  Add flour and water mixture (2.5tblsp flour/4tblsp water), mix well.  place into baking dish, top with colby jack or sharp cheddar cheese (I used about 1-2 cups) and then mashed taters (I did cheat and used boxed mashed potatoes that I doctored up with chives, garlic and onion powder) and cook for 20mins. take out and brush top with butter and milk and bake for 5 more minutes.  Not sure if this can still be called shepherd's pie after my alterations, but we love it.",
