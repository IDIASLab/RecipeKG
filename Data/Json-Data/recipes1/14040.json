Still can't taste the pineapple that much but they're nice and moist. Also since the pineapple is juicier than pumpkin I added 1/4 cup of flour. I used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 of white and since I don't like nuts in my cookies I just left 'em out! I would add a bit more spice to them too. Love 'em though and I will make them again! I love baking in the fall:)",
