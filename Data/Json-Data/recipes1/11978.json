But what I did do was put all the seasoning into the cream before I boiled the vinegar (which didn't boil) but got really hot. I thought I had messed it up because the eggs kind of cooked scrambled but I whisked in the cream real quick. It was so so good I hate hard boiled eggs - This was a great Potato Salad I'll be making this again",

The sauce is basically homemade mayonnaise which is delicious. I don't see how you could go wrong with a recipe that contains real cream it has to be rich and creamy. Only thing I would do is add some chopped hard boiled eggs I gotta have them in my potato salad. Also I will make this the day before so it's icy cold.",

This does not deserve bad reviews BUT you need to realize it is for the most part a recipe for homemade mayo and if you don't like the ingredients you won't like the end result. Personally I didn't change a thing but I am a fan of homemade mayo. The sugar suggestion is good if you like a milder flavor. Also no need to boil the vinegar since it only needs to be hot enough to cook the egg. And yes it will appear scrambled for a bit. I did continue to cook mine after adding cream etc. to get the consistency I wanted as well as blending the flavors a bit more.",
