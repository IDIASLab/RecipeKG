The cheesecake was undercooked even when I followed the exact directions, the sour cream topping did not \"set\" and the overall consistency was poor.

I let them cool on the rack in the pan and as soon as I was sure they were room temp I just had to try one. I immediately noticed how overwhelmingly eggy they were. Not wanting to give up on them so soon I refrigerated them overnight per peoples' suggestions in their reviews. They are better now for sure but not QUITE the dense cheesecake texture and taste I was hoping for. I swirled some melted chocolate in some of them which cuts the egg-like taste and texture some but it unfortunately also cuts the cheesecake flavor as well. I may try these again with less eggs but I won't try them again as is.",

I then spooned the cream cheese mixture on top of my crust.  I did not make the sour cream topping.  Instead I sprinkled chocolate chips on top of each cupcake.  I baked them for 25 mins and they came out perfect.  Everyone at work loved them!!",
