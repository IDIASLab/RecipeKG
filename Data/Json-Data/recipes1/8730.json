No need to seperate out ingredients just dump them all into one bowl and mix them up. 2. If you don't have a mini muffin pan line a large cake pan with mini cupcake liners close together. This doesn't work as well with the large cupcake liners but works well with the small ones. All in all a great recipe.",
