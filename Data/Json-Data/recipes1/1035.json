Before you do, however, I urge you to pay careful attention to not only the one or two star reviews, but also to any reviews that indicate they made changes, or who comment that there was too much shortening in the recipe. They are all right on! My experience was the same...too much fat makes a dough that is too greasy, fragile and difficult to work with. I can't even comment on how it baked as I didn't get that far. I was so disappointed in the dough itself that I just pitched it and made it again using my old recipe. I didn't trust the dough enough to gamble with what the finished product would  be. If you make the necessary changes to  make this pie crust work then you really aren't using this recipe anyway!",

I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening instead of all shortening and mixed them together and put it in the fridge. I also put my food processor bowl in the fridge.  After they were good and chilled, I put the flour in the food processor and added the shortening and pulsed it till it looked coarse and then I added ice cold water to it a little at a time as I pulsed it until it formed a ball.  It came out EXCELLENT in taste and texture! My hubby is a pastry chef and gave it thumbs up! Oh and I put a little less salt in it because my butter had salt.  If you use the unsalted butter put the full tsp of salt in it as the recipe indicates.",

It keeps the shortening from blending too much with the flour, leaving you with little pockets of shortening that result in extra flakes.",

It has worked out pretty good for me, but I always have to work in so much flour. Many of my friends have tried that recipe, and think it is ruined, and toss it. They are daunted by the gooey appearance of the dough. This recipe changes the ratio just a little bit, and the crust is perfect. I skip the chilling, I just let it rest on the counter for 30 min. before I use it. I never plan well enough in advance to put things in the fridge. I avoid recpes that tell me to do that, usually. It is now my favorite crust recipe. I am entering a pie in a contest next weekend, I think it will win. Thanks for the great crust recipe. (the pie did not win the contest, but the crust got rave reviews, and I was asked for it many times.)",

I was sceptical about this one, because it sounded wayyy too simple, and I had tried one that used the exact same ingredients before,but different ratios, and didn't turn out so good. So I thought, I'd try it and see if it would make a difference. And did it make a difference! I used unsalted butter instead of shortening. It came out so flaky and fluffy and delicious! Even my mom (who can be pretty critical sometimes), said that it was the perfect crust! I was shocked! It really is the best ever pie crust! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.",
