Several bakers from the club mentioned that blueberries and lemon are especially good together too. So next time I will replace the vanilla with lemon and give it go. This is a moist old fashiony cake. Well worth trying if you have any spare berries hanging around!",

It was very moist but was too wet in the center. I added more time than the recipe stated & it still was too dense. This recipe could benefit from some kind of light cream frosting or something served on the side. My husband would not try this. Once I told him there was a mashed potato in it he refused.",
