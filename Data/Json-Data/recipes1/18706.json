I'm used to having butter on the toast, then warm milk being poured over a piece of toast, and then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  I liked the vanilla in this version. The sugar could be cut back with it still being sweet enough. Try this recipe and let it stir up a memory in you or experience some old fashioned comfort if you've never tried it before. Thanks for posting this recipe.",
