Have always relied on this recipe as a crowd pleaser. \r\nFor a low-fat version that has just as much flavor, use fat free refried beans, reduced fat sour cream and reduced fat (or 2%) sharp cheddar cheese... don't much care for the flavor of the Mexican cheese blend... it might depend on the brand of cheese.\r\nHints for making guacamole:  Make sure avacados are dark green and slightly mushy.  Instead of peeling the avacados, it's easier to just cut them in half, pop out the pit, and scoop the flesh out with a spoon.  Go ahead and squeeze the juice of one whole lime onto the avacado... no need to measure it.  \r\nIn addition to adding taco seasoning to the sour cream, I also mix some with the refried beans.\r\nI prefer to spread the guacamole first, then the sour cream, since the guac is heavier.  \r\nLastly, throw on some jalapenos with the other toppings for an extra little kick.\r\n",
