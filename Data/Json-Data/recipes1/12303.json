Other reviews give this pie a low rating because its not sweet enough, but thats because the recipe ask for a SUGAR PUMPKIN. If you sue a regular pumpkin then you need to add a few cups of sugar to compensate.  Seems like people don't like to read things through and complain when the result is not what they wanted, even tho its their own fault.",

Thank goodness I read the reviews before I made the pie because call me dumb but I probably would have completely overlooked the lack of sugar. Along with this omission was the fact that no approximate measurement was given for the amount of pumpkin puree a \"medium\" sugar pumpkin would yield. It seemed to me that 3 cups of milk was waaaaay too much so I added 1 1/4 to what was about 1 1/2 cups of puree and this created a very soupy mixture. It's still in the oven as I write this but I'm sceptical as to its outcome. Luckily I have a can of pumpkin puree in the cupboard!",
