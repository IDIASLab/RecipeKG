However I followed it to a T as written and made 2 small 6 inch cakes and more then a dozen cupcakes. And here's what I can say about it. 1 if you can't have eggs. This would be an excellent alternative for that fact. However my cake did raise my cake was rich moist and dense but still slightly light. It did have a harder texture on the top of the cake because of the sugar. Not bad but it was there as well as a slight after taste. I could handle it it was due to the coffee. While my kids totally said it was awesome with the chocolate fudge frosting I used. And it quite complaimented the flavor of the cake. I didn't think the aftertaste of the cake was bad. Slightly off the norm but it was fine however depending on the flavor of the coffee you use will create that back taste so to speak. Either reduce the amount of the vanilla or the strength of the coffee. But I did like the cake over all. What I didn't like is that fact of when handling with your hands from pan to cake board the cake was very sticky to the touch especially on the bottom even though a tooth pick test showed the cake was done. I can and will make again. Please note sift your dry ingredients well & mix your wet ingredients thoroughly before mixing together but mix all together just until combined. That is the key. And moniter the baking time mine didn't take as long when baking in small pans or cupcakes.",
