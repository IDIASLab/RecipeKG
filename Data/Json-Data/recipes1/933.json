I mix the cherrie pie  filling and crushed pineapples together then dump the dry cake mix on top and make sure it's evenly spread, but, I don't mix it with the fruit on the bottom - I just leave it on top. Then, I cut a stick-and-a-half of butter into small pats and arrange on the top of the cake and stick in the oven. This is sooo delicious - I can't stop eating it! Be sure to use butter instead of margarine, too, because it gives it a certain taste!",

It is absolutely unbelievable!!! By far one of my favorite desserts now.  The only things I do different is use a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple (you really need that size, a 15 oz. would not spread over the 9x13 pan), lite cherry pie filling instead of regular (cuts down on the sugar a bit, but you won't even taste the difference), omit the nuts and use 3/4 (1 1/2 sticks) cup butter, sliced over the top.  Don't melt the butter in the microwave and pour over.....slice it in pats across the top of the cake mix and let the oven melt it. This allows for even browning.  I took this to a Christmas party last night and people were going back for seconds and thirds, and someone requested that I email the recipe first thing in the morning.  There you have it - cheap, easy, and delicious, what more do you need to try it?",
