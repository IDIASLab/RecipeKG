And this dish is definetly a low cost meal that delivers big results. Here are the changes I made - first I sauteed together chopped onions, celery & carrots - which is called a mirepoix. Then I added the flour and then milk with some chicken stock. To this I added additional seasoning - garlic powder, thyme, rosemary, and sage. Then I added canned vegetables and canned chicken. Of course fresh would be better - but I use what comes in the back door - so we get alot of canned items. The consistency is like thick gravy. Then I poured this mixture into my pans. I have a bakery mix that is much like Bisquick I used to make the biscuit mixture. In reading the other reviews I noticed that the same issue kept coming up - the biscuits were done on top but still gooey/runny on the bottom. So I made my biscuit mixture a little on the \"sloppy\" side - not runny like pancake batter - and not doughy like biscuit dough - but somewhere in the middle- \"gloppy\". Then I spooned the biscuit batter on top of the chicken mixture in spoonfuls that left about a inch space around the \"glop\" as the glop will rise and expand as it cooks. It is important to leave a little room around your glops as this allows the biscuits to cook through. I got sloppy with my glops on the last pan and put them too close together and they didn't cook all the way th",

For those folks who had problems with the biscuits not being cooked on the bottom: prepare the biscuit dough BEFORE you make the chicken mixture, and be sure to preheat the oven so it's ready as soon as the chicken mixture is poured into the casserole dish and the biscuit dough is QUICKLY spooned on top.  The point of putting the biscuit dough on the HOT chicken mixture is to start cooking the biscuits immediately, so they don't get soggy on the bottom. This is why dumplings go into HOT stew, and cobbler dough goes onto HOT cooked fruit. ",

I use frozen peas, but slice my own carrots and cook them for 5 min. first before adding them to the chicken mixture.  To cut down on preparation time, I used frozen biscuits.  I baked them on a separate pan at 375 degrees for only five minutes and then put them on the hot chicken mixture and baked at 425 degrees for 12 minutes.  Everything was perfect!  If you feel the biscuits are getting a little too brown, cover the dish with aluminum foil.  I served this with a mixed greens salad.  Fast, easy, and comforting with ingredients one generally has on hand.",

I used half butter instead of all butter, low-sodium chicken broth and half-n-half milk for the chicken mixture. I use frozen peas with pearl onions, added diced celery, 1 medium orange, yellow and purple sweet carrots diced. For seasoning I added 1tsp of poultry seasoning, 1 garlic clove, chopped, fresh rosemary, fresh ground black pepper and Hawaiian sea salt.  As soon as I made the biscuit dough I quickly spooned them on top the HOT chicken mixture to start cooking the biscuits immediately. This helps avoid any soggy biscuits on the bottom. I had 12 biscuits spaced about 1 inch apart. I used a 13x9 dish and covered the dish with aluminum foil. I baked the chicken at 375 degrees for 30 minutes, turned off the oven, uncover the foil from pan, brushed the tops of biscuits with melted butter for a golden crust and left the mixture for 10 minutes before removing. The gravy was thick, creamy and savory! The chicken was tender and vegetables cooked just right. The biscuits were not soggy but golden brown, flaky and delicious. They rose and expanded while baking up almost touching each other. I served this chicken biscuit pie over a small mound of, \u201cCreamy Smashed Potatoes,\u201d also from this website. This is a true comfort food-very hearty, tasty and fulfilling.",
