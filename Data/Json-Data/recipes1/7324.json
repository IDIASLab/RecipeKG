I kept it on 200 for 24 hours and believe me if you try it you won't regret it. The pot was finished within a few hours after it was turned off. After all of that tike I spent keeping it in the oven but it was worth it. It makes a very big difference. I didnt use onion soup mix because it contains monosodium glutamate instead some onion powder or garlic powder in addition to fresh crushed garlic works really well. Thank you very much for posting this recipe!!!",

Unfortunately the water didn't evaporate as I had thought it would (when I make vegetable soup in the crockpot the water always evaporates) so it turned out really soupy. I managed to salvage it by scooping out the thick parts at the bottom and siphoning off the liquid. It's probably a fine recipe when followed exactly but unfortunately we don't like to keep the oven on even at a low temperature over Shabbat. It just makes the house especially the kitchen really hot.",
