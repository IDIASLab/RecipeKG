Not to mention we ended up making a haunted gingerbread house out of your recipe! I don't like the thought of wasting lots of eggs and butter on something you're never going to eat so I used this recipe baked it for 15 minutes and left the pieces out overnight to dry out. It worked out beautifully. Thanks again!",

The frosting was a little strange to make but worked beautifully for piping onto the cookies. The cookies were so moist and tasty as long as they weren't overbaked. You must make sure that you bake them only as long as the recipe states; baking them to long will yield an inedibly hard cookie! Next time I will use some whole wheat flour to make the cookies even healthier!",

The texture of the cookie was like that of regular gingerbread cookies; firm but not tough. The frosting recipe that came with it is perfect. It's sweet and sticky enough at first to hold sprinkles well dries enough to make the cookies easy to store but doesn't become too hard. The problems I did have with the recipe was that I had to use twice as much liquid to get the dough to hold together and even had to spray it with water later then re-flour to roll it. If this affected the final product it didn't spoil it. I also used Post-um instead of coffee and found it was still good though next time I will add more ginger to compensate for loss of flavor. This may seem like a lot of work and tinkering with the recipe but it's well worth it to have a good fat-free gingerbread cookie.",

                "reviewBody": "The recipe's great but the instructions could be a little better. First of all my dough was very crumbly and difficult to stick together even after adding two teaspoons of water to it. Second it should be noted that the cookies expand significantly when baked so leave lots of room between each gingerbread-person on the tray. Finally for some reason I was never able to get the icing firm enough. It says to beat on high for 7 to 8 minutes: I beat on high for 20 minutes and it still didn't form stiff peaks. As a result the icing ran a little on the cookies making it very difficult to make faces buttons and the like. If you're short on time or simply want to avoid the mess It's probably a better idea to buy the icing. Otherwise the cookies are delicious and low in fat - definitely a keeper!",
