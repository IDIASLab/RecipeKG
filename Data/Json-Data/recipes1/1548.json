I didn't have natural peanut butter just used the 'fatty stuff.' I had no wheat germ so I used graham cracker crumbs. I also didn't have apple juice concentrate so I used apple sauce (a bit less than 1/4 c.). Then I added a few Tbsp. of honey. To chill I lined a paper plate with waxed paper placed the 'nuggets' on that then put the whole plate in a lare ziploc bag and froze. The only negative I have is that the recipe only made 11 'nuggets' would have to increase the ingredients next time. P.S. If you hadn't realized already i wasn't really going for sugar-free. (BTW: coconut has sugar in it)",
