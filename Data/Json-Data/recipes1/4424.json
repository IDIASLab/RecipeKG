Secondly, I only formed into one dough into a large cirlce rather then what was called for. I cut it into 8 pieces. Finally, I brushed the tops with the remaining bit of buttermilk that I had and put regualar granulated sugar on the top. When they were done I made a glaze from 1c. Powedered Sugar, 2T. Real Maple Syrup and A little vanilla and maple extracts. Drizzled this on the cooled scones and it was amazing. They tasted just like the ones that the restaurant I used to work at served. I really must say these are great. I had used another and this recipe I was very happy with. The whole family ate them up. Thank you very much for haring this recipe.",

My oven temperature is usually right on with recipes' baking temp. & time, so I was surprised that these were supposed to bake at 50 deg. higher than I baked them at, yet for the same time as I baked mine.  Next time, I'll decrease the baking time further (perhaps 12 or 13 minutes at 375). I used dried cranberries.  I was puzzled by the reference to \"dried pears\" in Step 4 of the recipe since they weren't mentioned as possible ingredients.",

They were crunchy on top because of the sugar(I used the unprocessed natural sugar so it was a lot more coarse giving it a very pretty look!). I replaced one cup of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour. My food processor never got the mixture to look coarse or grainy but more like very fine sand. I love the subtle maple flavor. The only thing I didn't love was the dried cherries...they tasted sort of like raisins after baking. I tasted them before I put them in the batter and they were good so I would probably leave them out next time.",
