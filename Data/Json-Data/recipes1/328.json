It seemed to need something more (butter water or maybe an egg) to keep the crumbly mixture together. When I put the indention in the cookie it really crumbled. So the second batch I added 1 tablespoon of water and 2 more tablespoons of butter. The mixture held together and rolled out better. This time I didn't put the indentation in immediately I let them cook for about 5 minutes then put made the little hole. This worked much better. I love the filling and the chocolate drizzle. Plan to use caramel drizzle next time. Very melt-n-your mouth cookie! YUMMY!",
