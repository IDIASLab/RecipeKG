I can't count how many times people have asked me for the recipe. They don't come out too pretty but they taste fantastic. I always use real butter ghirardelli white choc chips and the sweetened coconuts flakes (Baker's brand). About some of the complaints I've read--if your cookies are coming out too flat and runny looking it's because your butter melted too much (it's tempting to melt it in the microwave because there's so much). If you do let everything soften too much cool the dough for a bit before baking. I use a cookie scoop or tablespoon to measure these out. Also be generous with the space you give them on the sheet. They're...territorial.
