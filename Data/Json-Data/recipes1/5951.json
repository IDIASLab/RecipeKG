Serve over cooked white rice if desired. (Note: You can vary the amount of chicken to taste. The less you use, the stronger the flavor).",

I will begin by at cutting the garlic salt back by at least half.  Also, the ketchup flavor is too prominent; I will decrease the ketchup next time.  With these modifications, I suspect I would rate the recipe at least a four--maybe a five.  The flavor is decent and could be far better.",

Full portion of ketchup is probably too much but 1/2 is not enough (bottom line - to taste). I used boneless/skinless thighs - drained most of the fat/liquid off b4 adding the sauce. Also brushed both sides up front (double the vinegar/spice mix use low sodium soy - skip the garlic salt use powder or fresh).",

The only changes I made were: I only used three quarters cup of ketchup and because I found the sauce to be a little runny, I added 2 tbsp of cornstarch and water during the last 10 minutes of cooking, it thickened the sauce beautifully.

Also instead of basting the chicken with the soy sauce mixture - I mixed ALL the ingredients in one bowl and covered the chicken in it. Much easier!
