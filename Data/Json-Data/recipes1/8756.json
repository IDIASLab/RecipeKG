                "reviewBody": "Ganache recipes can vary greatly in chocolate to cream ratios - this version falls somewhere in the middle and is great! To simplify the process, I chop the chips in my food processor until they resemble fine crumbs. Then I heat the cream in a heavy bottomed saucepan until it just starts to bubble around the edges, pour the hot cream down the feed tube of the food processor, and give it a whirl... in seconds you have wonderful ganache. I should mention that chocolate chips contain stabilizers that allow the chips to keep their shape while warm, and those stabilizers don't melt down smoothly like chocolate does, so for a smoother finished product, I strain the warm ganache through a fine mesh strainer (this is not a necessary step, but will give more professional results). Use this ganache warm as a pourable glaze, let it cool to room temp (over night) and use like a standard frosting, or chill until firm and whip with a heavy stand mixer until it's lighter in color and spreadable. You can even use this ganache to make authentic chocolate truffles - just roll the chilled ganache (unwhipped) into balls and coat with cocoa powder, chopped nuts, or whatever. One more helpful hint: if you use this ganache to \"frost\" a cake, make sure the cake is brought to room temp before you try to cut it (using a hot knife). For added depth of flavor, try adding some liquor, vanilla, brewed coffee, or even coffee powder into the warm ganache mixture.",

I found the ratio of chocolate to cream to be a bit high for a cake filling, so I added extra cream to yield a creamier texture.  The result was a truffle-like filling.  Delish!  It's been said before, but do buy the best bittersweet chocolate you can.  I used standard bittersweet baking squares and found I had to add a few tablespoons of powdered sugar to cut down on the bitterness.   This basic recipe lends itself to personalization, whereby you could play with different flavored extracts to customize a flavor.  But it's great as is!",

I used semisweet instead of bittersweet chocolate simmered the (whipping) cream just a little longer (1 minute with only tiny bubbles staying around the edges and watched like a hawk) poured over the chocolate and let it sit about 5 minutes then slowly stirred until blended to avoid bubbles. This can take a while. It was pouring consistency after about 15 minutes and held its shape well over the Double Chocolate Brownie bundt cake from this site. Beautiful sheen tastes like hot fudge in fact we reheated the leftovers in a microwave (carefully) and poured some over vanilla ice cream. The recipe makes quite a bit I had at least 1-1/2 cups leftover. Solidified like fudge in the fridge. Will try it with white chocolate next time. Now in my recipe box!",
