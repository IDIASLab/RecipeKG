Try this recipe and you won't be dissapointed! -- Also this is wonderful toasted with some butter I bet it would make great crutons -- very flavorful especially the next day.",

I decreased the sugar to 1-1/2 Tbs. and the salt to 1 tsp. so that the flavors of the spices might come through. As I have learned from past experience it takes a LOT of spice to make a loaf of bread taste like one thinks it should. This bread is no exception. Next time I will only slightly increase the parsley nutmeg sage and celery seed since this bread has a good start on being flavorful. Really enjoyed this though!!!",

I love the taste of clery seed and it is very prominent in this bread--so make sure you like it if you try it! I used my bread machine to make the dough and I think it needed about 1/8 c more flour--bit it was raining here so that would do it. I baked in the oven at 375 for about 50-55 minutes. Turned out nice and golden brown yet still soft enough for sandwiches and flavorful toast. Thanks for the recipe!",
