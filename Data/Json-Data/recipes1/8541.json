However I couldn't cook the reciepe with cornstarch with the older family in Texas so I have to go back to the older way of doing it. My family is famous for their pineapple cream pie..but we make it with plain prebaked piecrust.. and we don't add eggs to first mixture... only AFTER the cream mixture thickens. We then remove from heat temper the lightly beatten eggs before adding. Once eggs mixed well...we add butter and vanilla or whatever flavoring you use and beat till shiny.. (My great grandma used flour instead of cornstarch and got a more old-time texture that holds up well if you want to refrig and then slighly warm. Also the flour type holds up better if left out under the table cloth of the holdiay table for the later supper. Since they were dirt farmers...corn-starch was not always available and flour made pies held up well to being able to set out in cupbords less weeping or watery separation if you use meringue instead of whipped cream. Anyone remember the way southern country folks tended to have their dining rooms unheated...then after sunday dinner after church...all left overs dishes and desserts are left on the table and covered with a clean bleached table cloth and left till supper?",

I made a few modifications: cut milk by 1/2 cup and added a 1/2 cup of pineapple juice cut 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and replaced with 1 teaspoon of pineapple extract. When made with these modifications this pie is perfect and probably would be even if you don't have pineapple extract. I also used the \"Basic Flaky Pie Crust\" recipe from this site which turns out flaky and perfect every time! You will end up with extra filling but I just put it in a dish and one of my kids enjoyed it as homemade pudding:)",
