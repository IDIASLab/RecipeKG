The only changes I made were that I used a 46 oz. bottle of V8, 2 cans of beef broth, 2 16 oz. bags of frozen veggies, a package of onion soup mix and instead of  the spices noted, I put a little oil in bottom of pot put the stew meat in the pot and sprinkled them with pot herb (a dried herb mixture found in spice stores and supermarkets made for soups and stews).  When the meat browned, I added all of the other ingredients and some basil and black pepper and simmered for several hours.  Served w/rye bread and butter for dipping.  DELICIOUS!  Will make again and again! Thanks for a great recipe.   ",
