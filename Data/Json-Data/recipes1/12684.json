With the exception of the salt I doubled the spices & increased the coconut a bit. Put it all in a 4 cup souffle & baked for 24 minutes. Hubby suggested that next time I bake it in individual dishes for a prettier presentation. I served it w/ baked pineapple slices w/ a brown sugar/butter glaze & a romaine salad w/ walnuts & raspberry vinaigrette. I had a bottle of sauvignon blanc open so that's what we had but because of the spiciness of the dish I think a gewurztraminer would make a better pairing. Thansk Claire...this was very good!",
