Replacing half the oil with unsweetened applesauce lightens things up a lot without compromising moistness. The addition of 1/2 tsp baking powder resulted in a higher lighter cake as well. This recipe is very pale in flavor. Spice cakes should have a definite robust taste redolent of the spices used. Results were helped tremendously by doubling the cinnamon and cloves adding ground nutmeg allspice ginger and mace (1/2 tsp of each.) As you can probably guess I feel there is potential with the given recipe but just too much need for adjustments to merit a higher score.",

When I pulled the cake out of the oven after the 45 minutes I did the toothpick test and it came out clean so I knew it was done cooking. I let it sit overnight so that the spices would mix well. When I pulled it out this morning to cut it apart and get it ready for our brunch the middle had fallen so that it was half the height of the rest! Add insult to injury - I cut it in half and in the center of the cake was uncooked cake. How it could have been uncooked after I tested it I don't know! But I had to throw out about half of the cake.

Great quick cake for tea especially if you've got no eggs in the house. Tip--the top gets crispy so when you check it with a toothpick be sure to break through the crispy top enough to see if the toothpick is truly coming out clean. If you just stick it straight in and pull it straight out the crispy top may wipe the toothpick clean as you pull it out--and you may think it is done when it may not be. Also the cake gets nice and brown and pulls away from the sides of the pan when it is done. When I told my kids to rate this from 1 to 5 stars one gave it an 8 and the other said 20!:) Oh and it is also good the next day.",
