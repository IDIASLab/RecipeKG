This is a good recipe for potlucks, etc., as it can be prepared ahead of time and refrigerated or frozen until ready to bake.",

I loved that dish and am glad to find it on here. I've noticed a couple of people remarking about the noodles not being crunchy if you mix them into the casserole, but really, they're not supposed to be crunchy because they're substituting for egg noodles. The noodles absorb the liquid and give the dish body. Delicious recipe; it really takes me back. Thanks for posting this, Pat!",
