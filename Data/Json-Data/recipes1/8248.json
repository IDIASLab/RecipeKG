It tastes simular to pumpkin pie and if you don't tell anyone they probably will think that it is pumpkin. However I personally liked it much better than pumpkin pie and it is prettier because the color is richer. My 7 year old granddaughter thought it was \"supper cool\" that it was made from carrots and the pecans from our own back yard. I liked it even better the next day when it was cold from the refrigerator. But that may have only been because I was so full from our Thanksgiving meal to enjoy it fully on the first day.",
