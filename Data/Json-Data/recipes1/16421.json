I took advice from several different reviews and here is my variation: Spray the baking dish with cooking spray substitute half the butter with EVOO increase the honey to 3 Tbsp add 1/2 tsp each of ginger and garlic powder to the other sauce ingredients. Bake as described my chicken pieces were large and took a full hour to cook. When the chicken is finished baking remove from baking dish put chicken aside to rest with a rubber scraper transfer the sauce and drippings into a sauce pan. Whisk 1 tsp of corn starch into 3 oz of cold white wine. Mix this into the sauce and drippings and heat until sauce thickens. Serve the thickened sauce over the chicken or as a dipping sauce. Mmmm mmmm mmmm! The side dishes served were buttered carrots and Jasmine white rice. Mmmm 3",

Update Making this for the 3rd or 4th time in a month. My son specifically asked for this meal. It's definitely a keeper!",

The broccoli soaked up the sauce & was good. I served it with rice. I topped it with some fresh cracked pepper some parsley & added some crushed peanuts. Turned a blah looking dish into a totally impressive one. My husband loved it. I may try one other reviewers stove top method next time.",

I only had thin cuts of chicken and I was afraid of them drying out in the oven. Also, this cuts down on the cooking time.  I put the chicken and in a covered frying pan and cooked on medium heat for about 10-15 min, flipping them every 5 or so minutes. I then lowered the heat and uncovered for 5 more minutes to allow the sauce to thicken.  \n\nThe sauce is the best part!  I made this with some rice-a-roni and everyone ended up pouring sauce on the rice.  It was the best rice-a-roni ever!  I also made it with creamed spinach.  We had no leftovers! \n\nThe spinach recipe I used was Emeril's creamed spinach from the food network.  It's an amazing creamed spinach recipe and the spices of the chicken and the nutmeg in the spinach work very well together.",
