I added 1 tsp cream of tarter as per other snickerdoodle recipes (therefore approximating adding baking powder) to give the cookies a nice rise before they fall into their familiar crackle-topped shape. They're warm and soft right out of the oven and become more crisp/crunchy after they cool down. Very good!",

I did make a few changes but they were very very slight and shouldn't have effected the turnout much at all. These were crumbly taste like flour even after adding a full teaspoon of vanilla and adding cinnamon right to the batter. They never flattened and you cannot even pick them up. I was going to take these to my grandmother's 90th birthday party but taking these would be an embarrassment. I'm not even going to bake up the rest of them. I am known in my family as a great cook and cookies are my specialty. I was interested in these because they don't use cream of tartar which I'm out of at the moment. I'm going to make my peanut butter oatmeal cookies instead. They are a trademark of mine and foolproof. Don't waste your time or your ingredients on this.",
