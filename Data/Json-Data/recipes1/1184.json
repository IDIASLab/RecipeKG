I followed the recipe exactly and it hardly had any minty flavor since most of it got cooked out while in the oven.  The chocolate coating never fully hardened so the cookies HAVE to be refridgerated at all times or else the coating gets soft at room temperature.  After my first batch I modified the chocolate by adding the additional two (1 ounce) chocolate squares from the box, a tablespoon of mint extract, and some additonal hershey dark chocolate mini's.  I think the problem was in the butter that was added... butter doesn't solidify well at room temp.  Maybe less butter next time... or perhaps substitute with a small amount of crisco?  After the modifications, the cookies tasted wonderful and adding mint to the chocolate makes a HUGE difference!",

I didn't refridgerate them for as long as the recipe says; just an hour and they were fine. I dipped the tops of the cookies in melted semi-sweet chocolate chips (about half the bag) and added about 1/3 tsp of mint extract to the melted chocolate which I think really helped with the minty taste of the cookies. Also did not add the butter to the melted chocolate...didn't think it was really necessary.",

Part way through I started to wonder if it was worth the money savings to make these at home versus coughing up the 3.50 a box and supporting the girl scouts. The cookie dough was about as easy to work with as partially dried out playdough. I ended up adding about 1/2 c. of water and they were still too dry. Then you chill them then you cut them then you smash them back together because they crumbled apart when you cut them. Then you bake them then you dip them in chocolate that refuses to re-solidify at room temp because of the butter mixed with the chocolate. The result was a very small batch of extremely labor-intensive cookies that were not nearly minty enough (the mint volatilizes during baking and you lose most of the flavor) and is messy to eat. I will give this another shot BUT: I will add 1/2 c to 3/4 c milk/water to the dough and double the mint extract. I will scoop out the dough with a teaspoon measure and flatten them with floured hands rather than going though all the chilling/cutting/time. I will also add 1 t. mint to the melting chocolate and not add any butter. If the chocolate you are using is firm at room temp then it will return to firm at room temp as long as you don't add too much to it. I don't think adding 1 t. of liquid mint will affect this. I will report back. If this doesn't work my money will continue to go to the girl scouts",
