I use it for ice cream topping and the flavor is very very good, much better than the last $10.00 jar of fancy hot fudge sauce I purchased. It tastes even better after it has had time to sit in the fridge. Texture is like very thick pudding, but easy to adjust with a little milk and heating. Chocoholics - the best way to appreciate it is straight out of the container.",

I also stirred it occasionally with a whisk until it was luke warm before I refrigerated it. It turned out perfect no skin on top not the consistency of jello just a great dipping sauce that I would imagine goes perefect on just about anything we used it for pecan pie drizzled on top and on a serve yourself fruit salad. This recipe is a real keeper and will never waste my money again on anything store bought. Thanks for sharing it.",
