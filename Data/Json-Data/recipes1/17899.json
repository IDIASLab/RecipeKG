One thing that I will do differently next time is to steam them in the microwave as I know exactly how long it takes to cook them the way we like them. I overcooked the beans a bit today but that's not the recipe's fault. I'd recommend that you use a good-quality olive oil as it's an important element of this recipe. I will not put the beans in a bag the next time as too much of the garlic-mint-oil mixture stuck to the side of the bag making it difficult to get out. Simple yet elegant presentation for a side dish/salad that can be made early in the day. Will be making this a lot definite keeper!",
