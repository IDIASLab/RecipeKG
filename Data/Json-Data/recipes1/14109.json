For a serving for four it calls for 1 cup of orange juice I cut this down to 3/4 cup and I held back 1/4 cup of the 3/4 cup of juice to be added later to which I added 1 1/2 Tbsp corn starch. Keeping the sauce at a medium boil for at least 5 mins before you start to cook the chicken and keeping it there until you flip the chicken then add the 1/4 cup of juice with the corn starch and boil another 5 mins. Then add to chicken. It thickens very nicely and is very good even my fussy 10 year old who hates everything liked it.",

                "reviewBody": "I made this SO MUCH faster & easier & it was SPECTACULAR. Instead of cooking whole chicken breasts (which take longer) I cut two large chicken breasts into bite sized pieces. I sprayed a saute pan with Pam & put the chicken in (completely omitted the butter and oil step -- you don't need it). I sprinkled the chicken w/ about 1 heaping tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary and only 1/4 tsp salt & pepper since I had only half the chicken. I sauteed the chicken for about 5 to 7 minutes. I mixed the full amount of sauce ingredients (1/2 cup maple syrup, 1/2 cup white wine, one cup OJ). I did bring the sauce to a boil only to immediately realized that step did NOTHING for the sauce and was a waste of time & unnecessarily dirtied another pan. So I stopped right away and just poured the uncooked sauce over the chicken. I quickly scraped/deglazed the bottom of the pan to get up all the bits of rosemary & chicken (where all the good flavor settles). I simmered it for about 7 minutes before adding a tablespoon of butter to give the sauce a silky quality. I also grated about a half teaspoon orange zest into the sauce. Finally, I used about 1/8 cup orange juice to 1/2 teaspoon corn starch to thicken the sauce. Simmered 1 more minute then served it over mashed potatoes. YUM. Could put over brown rice too. This is right up there with the best of the recipe inspirations I've gotten from this site over the years.",

I never use the rosemary since husband doesn't like it, but I do add lots of mrs. dash on each side while frying.  Cutting the chicken to 1/2\" thickness also makes this tastes better b/c it cooks faster w/o drying.  That way you don't have to worry about the sauce cooking in raw chicken.  I always add 1.5T of cornstarch (to part of the orange juice until it dissolves THEN add to saucepan) as soon as I add the syrup, and this thickened up REAL good.  It's perfect when you're not in the mood to cook, but want something that looks like you did a lot.  I've used all kinds of syrup, and it's all turned out fine!  ",
