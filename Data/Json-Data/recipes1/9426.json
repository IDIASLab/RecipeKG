I used a 12 oz. bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and melted them in a double-boiler.  2.  When the chocolate was almost melted, I added 3 Tbsp. of shortening and stirred until it was fully melted. (Doing this helps the chocolate set-up firm and dry, and you don't taste it a bit.  3.  I dropped the cookies into the melted chocolate mixture.  4.  I used a fork to roll them over gently.  5.  I slid a fork under the cookies to lift them out, tapping off excess chocolate gently into the pot of chocolate.  6.  Finally, I used a toothpick to slide the cookie off the fork onto a sheet of waxed paper.  It was really easy to do, and the cookies looked gorgeous and tasted great!  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion, and melted white chocolate chips, which I died orange with food coloring, and piped the colored cholate on to the top of the cookie.  It really did look like something you would buy at a candy store.",

                "reviewBody": "Ok, I just made these, and this is the suggestion I have to appease those cooks who say the mix is too sweet. It started out as my mess up, to which I added too much orange juice, as my can was a 12 oz. can, and it calls for a 6 oz. can. Instead of doubling the rest of the recipe, and more sugar, I added a box of precrushed graham cracker crumbs until my mixture dried out and was easier to handle. I also bought mini paper cups and before rolling out 3 dozen cookie balls that didn't fit the \"1/2\" ball, I measured against my paper cups, so they were just a little smaller than ping pong balls. Now, that adjusts the sweetness and size issue some folks had. As for the dipping just follow the other cooks and use a fork or a skewer to get them dipped and add a little shortening or oil to the chocolate. I adorned mine with little sprinkles I bought that were snowflakes. How cute they are. And the mix isn't too sweet at all, in fact it has inspired me to do more with canned orange juice! Thanks Vicki!!",

                "reviewBody": "WOW! These were so delicious. Unlike another reviewer, I thought the orange flavor was very subtle and not overpowering. Here are some things to consider for ensuring the least mess and the most efficient way to cover with chocolate: line a large jelly roll pan with parchment or waxed paper;transfer melted chocolate to a plate or shallow dish; push a 5in bamboo skewer (get them several to a pkg at the market) down thru the top of the ball;place a good size amount of melted chocolate on a rubber or metal spatula; use a combination of rolling and patting action to coate the ball;place coated ball onto prepared jelly roll pan to chill; If you're a perfectionist, you may want to dab the hole made by the skewer with a dab of chocolate. Next time I make these I will cut the sugar to 3/4lb and add about 1/2t salt to cut the sweetness a bit. I made the balls approx 1/2-3/4\" round rather than an inch for ease of handling and eating.Judging by the moistness, I will probably let them \"set up\" in a 175 degree oven for a half hour or so. Most people would probably find this recipe perfect as is, but I am striving to make a similar product that is less messy to eat, especially when serving them for the holidays or to guests.These are very rich and delicious so keep serving size in mind.Thanks Vicki.",
