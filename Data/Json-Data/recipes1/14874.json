I love any dish I can make ahead and just take out of the fridge to serve. I used uncooked but peeled deveined shrimp with tails on which made it even easier as I didn't have to peel the shrimp. I cut the salt in half and will probably use even less next time I make this. Also squeezed a bit of fresh lemon over the shrimp before serving. Thanks for this recipe - I'll definitely make it often!",

I used Key West Pink fresh frozen shrimp that I thawed and deveined prior to cooking but left the shells on to better retain the flavor. Cooled then shelled and added to the marinade to which I added more fresh dill than the recipe called for probably about 1/2 cup minced and no it wasn't too much. Very good will be doing this many more times!",
