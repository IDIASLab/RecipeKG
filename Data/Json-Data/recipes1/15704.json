I was looking for a high protein snack for after workouts when I didn't feel like making a smoothie or when I needed a sweet treat without the sugar and this is it.  I used organic crunchy peanut butter but I think this would be also great with smooth peanut butter.  I also think that you could use regular unsweetened cocoa powder if you don't want to use the protein powder or don't have it (a great alternative if you are making this for the kids).  Of course, that decreases the protein, but still provides a healthy snack.  The next time I make these, I will refrigerate the mixture first before I roll into balls because the mixture was very mushy and difficult to make into balls.  No problem, easily fixed, but mine didn't turn out as pretty as the recipe submitter.  They still taste great! Thank you for the recipe!",
