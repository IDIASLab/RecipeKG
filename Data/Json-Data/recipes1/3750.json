I also substitute applesauce for the butter in the dough and add lots of raisins and prepare the dough using a bread maker (use extra milk instead of the water and just throw the ingredients in the bread maker according to its directions - I do liquids, then dry ingredients, and yeast last).  For the filling I also use applesauce instead of butter but add a little at a time to get a nice pasty filling that I can spread.  Before I bake the bread, I add an egg white wash so that it comes out golden brown.  I can not believe how delicious this cake is without using any butter.  No one believes me that it isn't full of oil and butter.  My favorite recipe!!!",

                "reviewBody": "Better than bakeries! Living and eating in New Orleans for my entire life I was a bit skeptical if I could actually pull off a king cake.  I wanted to make mine a tad more traditional so I made the following modifications: 1. NO RAISINS in the filling- I have never (in my 20-something years of eating king cake) seen raisins in one.  I did make 1 and 1/2 times the filling too. 2. To first rise the dough I placed a mug of boiled water in the back of the microwave.  I then placed my covered bowl of dough in the Micro and shut the door for 2 hours.  The dough came out so fluffy.  I think this technique played a part in the pillowy softness and tender layers of the finished cake. 3. I opted for a elegant braided look.  Instead of just rolling the filling in a spiral I divided each rolled dough sheet into three sections.  I then scattered the filling on top and rolled those long pieces into mini-spirals.  I was then able to roll each segment out longer and finally braid the three sections together.  It looks so nice on a cross-section when sliced too! 4. I placed a ramekin in the center while the cake was rising the second time to prevent the middle of the cake from rising together- I wanted to keep the ring shape of it all. 5. Baked at 350 degrees for 27 minutes- worked perfect for my oven.  My general advice would be to bake until the top is evenly golden. 6. I ended up using the entire icing recipe on one of my cakes and I had to thin it with a bit more water than called for.",

For the filling I left out the raisins and for the frosting I used milk instead of water in the powdered sugar and just eyeballed it; it was more like 4-5 tbsp milk instead of 2 making the consistency easy to pour over the cake. I made my own purple sugar about 1/3 c sugar 3 drops red food coloring and 3 drops blue. If you do this I suggest mixing the food coloring together before adding it to the sugar and it takes quite a bit of stirring to break up the colored bits but it worked great.

It is the easiest recipe (as far as King Cakes go) and the most authentic I found.  I had people originally from New Orleans saying it tasted just like home!  I shaped mine into a circle without the cuts and slathered the icing and stripes of yellow, purple, and green sugar - I also sat my babies on the top so that there wasn't an accidental choking!",
