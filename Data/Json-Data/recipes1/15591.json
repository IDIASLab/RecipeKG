Our 3 girls (6 and under) call it 'Sister Slaw' and will it eat before the rest of the meal. Massage the salad with your hands, especially the kale, to get the dressing worked into the veggies. This is critical and helps soften everything and really is the most important part!",

I used all quantities and ingredients indicated and followed the recipe steps exactly except that I used equal amounts of oil and vinegar as other reviewers suggested. If I had not followed this suggestion the dish would have been overwhelmingly oily. After letting the slaw marinate I tasted it for salt and pepper (I had added the pinch of each as suggested in the recipe when I mixed it earlier). I found that I needed to add 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper to the slaw to make it edible; otherwise it would have been completely bland. With the modifications listed above this dish was the hit of my family's Christmas gathering. We ate it for two more days and it remained crunchy and delicious. It was the perfect dish to balance out the heavier foods of a Christmas dinner and I'll be making it again in the future.",
