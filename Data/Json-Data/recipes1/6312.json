I was very disappointed by the amount of doctoring I had to do to this recipe. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t nearly enough onions, instead of 2 onion I used about 4 cups, omitted the water and halved the butter.  I also added about 2 T. garlic (fresh, minced), 1/4c white wine, 2T worcestershire sauce, 1T fresh parsley, dash of salt and a healthy dose of fresh ground pepper and about 1/2t herbs de provence(yum!). \n\nThe result turned out very yummy but I felt like I had to rewrite the whole recipe.",

These are the changes i made:  Just like some of the below comments i used only 3T of butter (this was PLENTY!!!). I also sauteed the onions with 1 clove chopped garlic - then added 1/4 cup of white wine.  I also added about a cup more of beef stalk (would have done boullion if i had had it).  I also added 1 1/2 Tbl. of worchestier sauce, 1/2 tsp parsley, and 1/4 tsp ground thyme.  With these changes..mmm.. it turned out yummy!",

Right off the bad I followed the people who said to add more broth and less water and to use a boullion cube. My reaction to this can be described in three words: \"Holy gravy batman!\" Basically by using the three aforementioned suggestions I ended up making beef broth with a hint of onion. While people may like this I prefer the more oniony taste myself. Here's what I suggest. If you want your onion soup beefy go ahead and use the three cans broth. Otherwise leave it as is or (-and I would do this either way-) use another onion. Cut the onion in sixths or eights and then peel apart the layers for more stability and flavor - I found the rings too fragile and not worth the work. A dab of worcestershire sauce and a (VERY) small sprinkle of thyme are a nice addition. Finally go for a blend of gruyere and provolone. Excellent taste. Guten Appetit!",

I added about 5.5 cups of beef broth and simmered for half an hour with a bay leaf. I removed the bay leaf and spooned the soup over toasted thick slices of french bread. Topped with swiss and baked at 425 for 10 minutes. It was fantastic!! I will definitely be making this again.",
