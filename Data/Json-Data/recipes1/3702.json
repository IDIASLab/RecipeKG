I did not soak my bean, but put them in a pan with the chicken broth and brought it to a full, rolling boil and then transferred it to the slow cooker. The beans turned out tender and perfect. I also added 2 big sprigs of epazote, which is an herb traditionally cooked with black beans, as well as 2 bay leaves. Along with the other spices I tossed in 2 packets of Goya Sazon. The addition of a can of tomatoes w/green chiles as other suggested sounded like a good idea, so that went in too along with 2 boneless, thin-cut pork chops! I left it on med-high in the slow cooker overnight (about 15 hours total). I do not feel this soup was too thin. I only mashed some of the beans against the side of the kettle with the back of a spatula.I just had a big bowl with a dollop of crema....yum!",

If you are pressed for time just use the canned black beans, toss the rest of the stuff into a slow cooker, (I also added a can of diced tomatoes) and when you get home, dinner!  I just pureed  about 1/2 the soup for a more authentic look, and served it with chopped green onion, sour cream, cheddar cheese and homemade guacamole. Also, although I am not a huge fan of spice, I found this just right with the amount of cayenne recommended and two minced jalopenos.  They really mellow out in the soup and it won't be that spicy, just the right amount. YUM!",

I also added some chopped cilantro and a tbsp fresh lime juice. An hour before serving I put half of the soup in the blender and returned to crock pot. This made it thicker. I served with sour cream and shredded cheese on top. It was spicy....yummy and gone in a heartbeat! Will make it again.",
