Another reader suggested adding Nutmeg. In the suggested quantity I think that is overpowering. Traditionally, the spice used was Mace, which is a related milder spice, but it's more expensive than nutmeg. It will give the pastry a golden color and that mysterious \"what's that spice?\" quality.   For this recipe use about 2 tsp of Mace.",
