I made it for a B-B-Que we attended yesterday( doubled recipe) and used fresh green beans , tomatoes, and onions from my garden. People raved about this dish.  Even people who normally don't like green beans went back for seconds!! I was asked several times for recipe . This is such a keeper!! Would give it more stars if I could! By the way, chef John is probably my favorite contributor!  I love all his recipes, always right on for amount, taste, and quality.",
