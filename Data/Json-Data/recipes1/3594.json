I used 8 cups of chicken broth instead of the water and 1 pound of soaked beans.  I put that on the stove and brought them to a boil and then turned them down to a simmer.  About an hour later, I added my onions and ham...maybe about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of ham (what was left from easter after sandwiches).  Returned to a simmer until done...about another 1 1/2 hours.  I then added 2 cans of the soup and 8 ounces of Velveeta and about 1 1/2 cups more chicken broth for the soupiness we like.  It was amazing.  I am sure it would be good just as written...just thought I'd share what had my family saying \"OMG that was good\" all evening.",
