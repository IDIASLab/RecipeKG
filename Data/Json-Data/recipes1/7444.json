The lime and vinegar are definitely strong even for a lime and vinegar lover like myself. I ended up adding sugar at the end to even up the field a little but the consistency of the sauce was great as written (I was a little surprised at that - I thought there might be too much cornstarch). I like my veggies barely-done to crisp-tender so the 6-8 minutes on the carrots and peas would have killed this recipe for me. I also added mushrooms and zucchini. I cooked the pork first and set it aside then did the mushrooms added the carrots for a few minutes then the zucchini snap peas and pork in just to heat through (which got my zucchini and peas just the way I like them). I like the spice and the overall flavor but definitely had to play around with this to get it where I wanted it. Thanks!",

Turned out spicy enough for our tastes (I like a little bite but no burn) but the vinegar overwhelmed the rest of the flavors. The lemon juice may have also played into the overpowering tang this dish had. I'll use this recipe as a base in the future but do something a little less tangy for the sauce.",

I always try to substitute cooking spray for any olive oil and I must say it did not diminish any flavor in my book! This recipe was beautiful until I added the 1 Tbs soy sauce 2 Tbs rice vinegar 1 tsp cornstarch and 3 tsp dark sesame oil! My sugar snap peas just soaked up the vinegar taste and ruined the whole recipe! I added honey to try and tone down the vinegar flavor! After adding the honey the vinegar taste was toned down just a bit! I had to pick out all the sugar peas to make the recipe tolerable again! I beseech any other home-makers to not add the second bit of soy sauce rice vinegar cornstarch and sesame oil! Without that this recipe is FANTASTIC! An absolutely perfect bite! I will definately cook this again but leave out the aforementioned ingredients!",
