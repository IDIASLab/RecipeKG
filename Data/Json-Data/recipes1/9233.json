You are looking for a 'gel' instead. Make sure your mixer is on high when adding the 'gel' in. If you see the consistency get soupy that means your 'gel' was not thick enough. Apply your 'gel' liberally into your whipped egg whites to keep the airy peaks. Make sure also to whip your egg whites away from your oven and do not try to do a meringue in high humidity or foggy days unless you want soupy results.",

I've also heard that based on only those ingredients most of the time your meringue will fall flat. I was excited to find a recipe that had a thickening agent such as cornstarch but at the same time concerned there might be a starchy or pasty taste. The finished result was great; stood firm and very tasty. Twelve minutes at 450 seemed a little too long; mine was golden brown at 8 min. I think it's my oven though; I think it gets hotter than the digital read says it is. Overall I'm very impressed with the results of my first meringue; thank you.",
