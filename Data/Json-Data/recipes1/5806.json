I reduced the amt of melted butter poured over the lobster by half after reading other reviews. Even the gals that hate to cook took this recipe home with them.My group gave you 14 thumbs up Gina.

I topped the lobtser w/ chopped garlic (did give it a quick saute in EVOO) & Old Bay. I was out of bread crumbs so I whirled up stuffing mix in my food processor. Loved teh extra flavor the seasonings in it added! I strted off our Valentine's dinner w/ Chambord Spritzers Deep Fried Camembert w/ Raspberry sauce (from allrecipes) served w/ apple slices. Then for dinner we had Raspberry Cocktail Sauce w/ Chilled Shrimp (again from allrecipe) this excellent lobster dish & white wine steamed asparagus w/ Chocolate Cherry Heart Cakes for dessert. It was a fabulous dinner...very fitting for the holiday. Thansk for your contribution Gina Owens-Stanley!",

Butter amount could probably be reduced significantly without affecting the dish. Maybe it could be spooned onto portobella mushrooms for a fancy appetizer presentation?",

I swear my thighs turned into tree trunks just tasting the sampler. Dry meat floating in fat makes an unattractive dish that even a glutton couldn't stomach. Don't waste the lobster on this recipe.",
