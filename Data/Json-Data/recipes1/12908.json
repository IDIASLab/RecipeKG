It's still handwritten. I just joined and will be posting it. Thanks to Verla for having at least one version of it! I can now make it at home til I sneak the recipe from my mom! It is delicious but you really do need it to be made in the oven. A bread machine does not do this justice. Make sure to add walnuts to your mixture and use REAL butter. The milk should be at room temp as should your eggs. It will give the bread an amazing quality! I promise! From one Polish fam to others!",
