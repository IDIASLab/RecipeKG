I did two things differently: 1) I removed the skins from the tomatoes by plunging them into hot water and 2) I gently sauteed chopped onions with the oil before adding the chopped tomatoes. Next time I'll try this with sauteed tri-color bell pepper and kick it up a knotch by adding a few flakes of chili pepper. Adding fresh chopped up Italian herbs also adds great flavour. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing!",
