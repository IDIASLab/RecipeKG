The tip about shaping the dough into patties and baking in a cake pan was perfect. I brushed the top with a little butter and it came out golden and flavorful. I always use real butter when baking and I think it makes a big difference versus using margarine. Baked at 425 18-20 min. This yielded me 6 large biscuits. I've made the J.P. Big Daddy Biscuits twice and they came out hard dense flat - not good and definitely not fool proof. This recipe is FOOL PROOF. Just don't overmix or knead. I also always need about 1 cup buttermilk versus 2/3.",
