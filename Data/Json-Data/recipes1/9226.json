I approximated amounts and substituted ingredients based on what I had on hand. This recipe works GREAT for that! I used 1 large carrot 3 bunches of baby bok choy left out the green beans (didn't have any) and used 2 cloves of garlc and 1/4 onion in place of the shallots. I also used tamari instead of soy sauce. Otherwise followed the order of cooking and used times as a guideline. If you've ever stir fried before just follow your instincts. Had it over jasmine rice with chicken adobo (used a family recipe) and my fiance and I loved it! I will definitely use this recipe again! I think next time I might throw in a few other veggies peanuts and some tofu to make this a tasty vegetarian main dish. Great starting point!",

The carrots and green beans took a lot longer to soften than the recipe states, and there's no way that minced shallots should go in first. I also suggest using sesame oil instead of peanut oil for a bit more flavor. I served it with 'Chinese Roasted Chicken' from this site. Nice meal. Thanks.",

Oh and to add flavour i added 1 crushed garlic clove at the beginning of the recipe. I think if your eating this by itself as a stir fry it has too much liquid in it. But if you mix it with rice or noodles or something they soak up the liquid so it isnt much of an issue. I served mine with some cooked white rice. Thanks for sharing!",
