The lime jello gives just the right kick!  I was asked for the recipe several times!",

After considering other reviewers' comments, I elected to add a shot of Cointreau to the mixture (for additional moisture and more orange flavor).  I found them to be delicious and the smell was wonderful. I also found that the mixture was easier to work with when making the balls on the smallish side, and to dip my fingertips in water about every \u00bd dozen or so (the extra moisture helps when forming them!)  I'm bringing them to a Cinco de Mayo cocktail party tonight and will give a couple dozen of these as a hostess gift. Thanks for a unique and tasty treat.",

(the whole box- hey why not the more chocolate the better right I dipped them in colored decorators sugar (green pink & white) they were pretty & sparkley. Everyone loved them. I wraped them up in celophane and tied them w/ a pretty bow and put them in a fun martini glass (didnt ahve a margarita glass) and gave as gifts. they got rave reviews!!",
