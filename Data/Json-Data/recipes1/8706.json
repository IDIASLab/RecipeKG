I could never figure it out because I found those cookies to be dry flat and only vaguely cinnamon-y. I tried this recipe because my husband loves snickerdoodles and this was the first one that popped up on my search....And I need search no further. These cookies are fabulous. A slight crunch on the outside a light texture on the inside that literally melts in your mouth. I omitted the almond extract because I detest the flavor and I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour. I also recommend using Saigon cinnamon (I think Spice Island is the brand I use)if you really enjoy a powerful cinnamon flavor.",

My husband brought some to work and there were requests for more. By the way I didn't have any almond extract so I just made them with the vanilla extract. I'm looking forward to trying them with the addition of almond extract. Following up 6 years later to say I did make them with the almond extract the next time and the time after that and the time after that....This is my most highly requested cookie recipe. The real secret is to take them out when they look not quite done. They will cook as they sit outside the oven on the cookie sheet and will be crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.",
