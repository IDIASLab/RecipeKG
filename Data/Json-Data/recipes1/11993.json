I thought that just the cream cheese and lemon juice sounded a bit bland so I instead mixed together the cream cheese lemon juice worcestershire hot sauce and some cracked black pepper. Then instead of salad shrimp I used large shrimp cut into thirds. I then made the cocktail sauce as directed. We served with fritos scoops because it is a pretty thick dip and the crackers wanted to break.",
