I also let it sit for a while, for the favors to blend together and the dried spices to infuse the mixture.  But, overall, the easiest peanut sauce to make.

Hubby is not a fan of peanut butter so he kind of turned his nose up at this...and my son thinks it belongs on toast with jelly but was open enough to at least take a bite. I on the other hand thought it was pretty good but needed to be doctored a little. I'll take the advice of others and add some more spices to see if that helps. I served this hot over pasta noodles.

I took the advice of many others and added 1/2 tsp ground ginger root 1 crushed clove garlic and pinches of both garlic and onion powder and slightly less soy sauce (I ran out). I used crunchy peanut butter and my fiance says it's the BEST he's ever eaten (we live in the Netherlands and this \"satay sauce\" is eaten quite regularly so that's a big complement). I also tried adding less water (some reviews said it was 'like watery peanut butter' but I ended up adding the rest of the water because it was so thick! I think the amount in the recipe is perfect). My only other comment would be that the serving size is for 6 people but we ate it with stirfry veggies and we used the entire amount between the two of us. For more than 2 - 4 people I would definitely double this recipe! Delicious will make again and again!",
