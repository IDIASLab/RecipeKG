But no big deal. \nI had leftover rice so I used 2 cups and I also added tofu, a really good addition for some protein. I was surprised I didn't have any basil so that was left out. Curious to see how it will taste with it.\n Instead of 2 Tbls. of soy sauce I used about 4 Tbl. and 2 Tbl. of butter instead of 1. My vegetables were on the bigger side so I had to adjust the other seasonings to more then the recipe called for. I didn't use any chili pepper flakes and good thing because I think it was spicy enough with the jalapeno and black pepper.\nNext time I'm going to use brown rice and add some cauliflower and some shrimp.",
