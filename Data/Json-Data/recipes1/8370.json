These are tasty but very plain looking. After the first sheet full I sprinkled nutmeg over the tops - it really helps both the appearance and flavor. If you don't want to sprinkle more on top then double the amt of nutmeg to get that eggnog flavor. My son loves eggnog and he fell in love with these cookies! One note - my batter was really sticky even after being refrigerated for quite a long time. It was humid here though so it could have used some extra flour. I really liked them as well - of course I like eggnog but I also don't like super sweet cookies - these are more rich than sweet which is just fine with me! To bake them we used parchment paper over cookie sheets - I'd doubt these cookies will easily come off much of anything else! Just the nature of the cooky. They did just great with no problems on burning or sticking. Thanks for sharing a tasty recipe!",

I also drizzled white chocolate across the top to add a little pizzaz. This dough is very versitile since you can made the base without the nutmeg and then divide it into three bowls add nutmeg to one for eggnog cookies white chocolate chips to another and molasses and ginger/cinnamon to another and get three different kinds of cookies from one mixing of dough. If you beat the dough a long time the cookies turn out nice and chewey. If they are too flat for you just add a little more flour to the recipe. I always bake a test batch before I put the flour in the fridge for any reason. This is a great recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "I rarely add salt to dishes like this. So I just didn't add the salt. The butter has some in it after all. And it wasn't needed. They were still wonderful and tasty without the salt. I liked how soft and almost cake like the cookie can be. They plump up beautifully. It's definitly a keeper. I found however the cookie was too sweet! Some said rich but I found it was sweet. I'll be cutting the 2 cups of sugar to 1 1/2 cups next time and hope that's enough of a reduction. After reading the recipe was kind of bland in terms of seasonings I spiced it up adding 1 tsp Cinnamon 1/4 Allspice 1/4 tsp Ginger 1/2 tsp Cloves in addition to the 1/2 tsp Nutmeg since this is how I spice my eggnog drink. It seemed logical to me to season eggnog cookies the same way. The spicing was good and I will keep the measurements as is. Makes for a spicy cookie but not too spicy (at least not for me). I used rum extract in my frosting instead of vanilla. I really liked that addition. Though I haven't figured out exactly how much extract to use to make sure it's enough but not overpowering. I'm still playing with that. Perhaps when I figure out how much I like I'll update this message.:) Thanks for the recipe!",

Even with doubling the nutmeg as others did and adding 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a couple dashes of clove I found them kind of bland. Also they did not spread as much as I expected causing the midde to not be done when the edges were getting crisp. I gave this 4 stars because I added some pumpkin pie spice to the last couple dozen and some chopped pecans I had on hand and wanted to get rid of- then I smooshed them down a little so they would be flatter. After doing this they were absolutely delicious. Also yield I got was over 5 dozen...Recommended with adjustments.",
