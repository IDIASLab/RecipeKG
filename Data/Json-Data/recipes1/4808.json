First I rubbed each chicken breast with a tablesoon of dijon mustard. This gave it so much flavor. Then after 40 minutes of baking I poured a small can of chicken broth over the whole dish. Then finished off the baking. There was still crunchy stuffing but it made it less like croutons. It was so good. You really don't taste the cheese so next time I will either use more or just leave it out.",
