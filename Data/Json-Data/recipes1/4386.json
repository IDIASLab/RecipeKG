This recipe is so easy, and so amazingly flavorful, I highly doubt you'll bother ever making another recipe again. This recipe is very flexible. Here is how I make it, and the kind of variations it can handle. I will use regular flour, whole wheat flour, organic flours, etc. They all work great. The butter needs to be SOFTENED, not MELTED. keep this in mind, please! If you need to soften butter in a hurry, cut the cubes into 5 pats apiece. Arrange them in a ring on a dinner plate, (none in the middle!) and place them in the microwave. If you have power percentage control, put it on 10% and give it 30 seconds or so. Repeat, testing until it is perfect. Dont leave the microwave. Yes, it'll take a few minutes, but it's better than finding a time machine so you can leave the butter out to soften this morning. If you don't have percentage control, cook the pats on high power for 4 or 5 seconds at a time, waiting about 20 seconds inbetween heatings. This is very important, so you don't end up with melted butter. Cream with the brown sugar, then add the cups of flour (I just use 4, I find it makes the cookies nice and tender!) and mix well. I don't knead the dough, I don't roll it out. I grab golf-ball size balls, place them on the sheet, and put a thumb-print in the middle. that's it! Cook them for the suggested time, no more, and you'll have fantastic melt-in-your-mouth shortbrea",

Yes it was simple to make and the ingredients were all easily at hand-  but the result was a very bland biscuit.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the other reviews, I had thought that this recipe would yield a better result.  But this biscuit lacks both flavour and the texture of a true shortbread;  and it leaves a dry feeling in ones mouth after eating.\r\n\r\nI believe that it is misleading to name this biscuit a shortbread-  it definitely lacks the true characteristics of a melt in the mouth, buttery shortbread.  This is not a dreadful biscuit, but it is not tasty or exceptional.  Defintely not a treat you'd serve to guests.",

I then used my cookie scooper and placed the balls on a cookie sheet lined with Release. I then sprinkled the tops with granulated sugar and then pressed the bottom of a glass down on the cookies. These did not expand much at all so you can really load your cookie sheet up. These turned out delicious (and pretty)! Thanks for the post!",

I just finished making a batch of these and the only changes I made were to add a tablespoon of vanilla, a pinch of salt and used the dough hook on my stand mixture to \"knead\" the dough. I also used powdered sugar instead of flour to roll the dough out. I sprinkled the tops of the cookies with sparkling white sugar (press into the dough) & then pricked with a large salad fork.
