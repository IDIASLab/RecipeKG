So after marinating the fish for 4 hours, I put the fish in a glass dish, poured the marinade over and put it in a 400 degree convection oven for 20 minutes, GREAT.  Putting it in the oven with the marinade gives the fish a glaze.  Delicious!! Thanks",

I often make it with canola oil rather than peanut oil, and it's just as good IMO.  I make this for others and share the recipe often.\n\nProbably my favorite recipe from this site....seriously.",
