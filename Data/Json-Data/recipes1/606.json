I used maple syrup since I had no corn syrup, also I added about a quarter cup of milk and added a whole cup of flour instead of just 2/3 cup. I also added only 1/2 a cup of sugar instead and the cookies turned out to be the perfect sweetness. I will definitely bake this again.",

I finally came back to this recipe and tried it again this time following the recipe exactly but I had to add some vegetable oil because there wasn't enough moisture to incorporate the ingredients well. The cookies still turned out rather sticky but much better than the last time. You can taste the nice hint of chocolate but they still seem to be missing a little something that would improve the flavour and counter the sticky corn syrup. I don't think I'll really want to make them again.",
