I take the rest of the tortillas and cut them into thin strips and fry them in a little olive oil to make crispy strips to put in the soup for a bit of crunch....delicious!!!!!

I use a roasted chicken (shredded) one large can of green sauce (no red sauce) and a small can of green chilis (no jalapeno). Add more broth if it gets too thick. I use a stick blender and give it a few whirls in the pot to smooth out the soup. top with grated cheese sour cream avocado and tortilla strips. (My husband makes strips by cutting corn tortillas into 1/4\"x3\" pieces laying them on a paper towel in the microwave and cooking for less than a minute. Watch it well as it will burn quickly!!!)",

Granted it gave me more soup but it was also a bit bland since I didn't have more enchilada sauce to match the amount of broth. I used fat free half-and-half just to cut calories and obviously fat! Next time I'll do 4 or 5 tortillas and maybe a bit of cayenne...and I'll definitely make it again.",
