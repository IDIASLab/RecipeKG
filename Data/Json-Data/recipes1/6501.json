I give it a four only because the salsa was too watery and made the dish dry in spots and runny in others - I recommend leaving out half or all of the water and adding a tablespoon of oil for a thick chunkier salsa. I also recommend doubling the salsa or at least saving some back to top the dish after cooking with another dab of sour cream. It was so nice to prep this the night before to serve Daddy in bed on Father's Day... add refried beans fresh fruit maybe some bunuelos (Mexican fried donut-things) and a PINA COLADA!!",

I love salsa verde and have made many recipes using it before but this was one I did not particularly enjoy. I spent about 25 minutes chopping veggies and preparing this recipe. However the fnished taste was quite average. The salsa was too tart and I believe this is because the tomatillos are not boiled but chopped and simmered. THe resulting flavor was tart. My 4 year old did not like it and I spiced mine up with a store-bought guacamole sauce and sour cream. I won't be making this one again.",
