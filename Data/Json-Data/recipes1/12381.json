The second time I made it I used triple the amount of oysters (fresh) doubled the onion and celery and used 8 oz. of sliced baby bella mushrooms. Much improved!!! We like our soups to be a main dish and these additions brought it up to that level without adding a whole lot of calories. I might try adding a cup of cubed potato next time to give it even more body. The flavor was there with the basic recipe and as is would be a nice first course at a special dinner.",
