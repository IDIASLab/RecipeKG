The best way (in my opinion) to make this - use 1 lb hamburger (brown first) a can of diced tomatoes and about 1 Tbs of water. No peas No tomato soup No cans of water. Layer the same order as noted in the recipe although on top of my hamburger I add more potatoes and carrots then salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle the water in over the top of it all. It's not a blow-your-socks-off meal but it's easy it's hearty you probably have all the ingredients. Plus it hits the spot at the end of a cold winter day.",

I have used a varity of Veggies as my layers and usually it more then seven. I was a little unsure of the peas but it all works! I think the problems the other reviews were having are these....... They used hamburger and not pork sausage! And tomato sauce not Tomato Soup. Both of which can make a huge differance! I am making this again tonight and will be using hamburger because that is what I have. But I plan on adding some extra seasoning to make up for it. My kids love this! But they love Salad too! I guess my kids are just smart like that!",
