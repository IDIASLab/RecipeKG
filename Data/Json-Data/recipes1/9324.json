Really you cant go wrong with the wonderful blend of fresh fruits but here are a few of my suggestions to make it better. First per the advice of others I omitted the pretzels and I didnt miss them. Second the cream cheese sauce made this dish very soupy. Too soupy for my taste. Because of this I sliced a store-bought angel food cake and served the dish as a sauce to be poured over the cake. I also feel that mixing the sauce seperately and serving it over individual cakes with the fruit would create a great variation of strawberry shortcake. In short the ingredients were wonderful and tastey I just didnt like it served alone in a bowl.",
