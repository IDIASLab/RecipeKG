It was underestimated how the consistency of the whipped topping would change with times being stirred or out of refrigeration during serving and even simply as it set. It became a bit more slurry then I would have liked so I'd suggest using 2/3 of the container if not less. Also the Spanish peanuts have a bit of an overwhelming taste; using unsalted peanuts was a much better addition. Lastly rather using two apples of the same I used a red and yellow apple. They added a bit more to the taste pallet (and color;D). However me and my family really enjoyed this recipe. After first tasting this at my local grocery store I saught out to make it: this was nearly it and didn't last long at my house!;) Notes: Don't be timid about how long one should/can heat the vinegar sugar egg flour and pineapple juice mix ( yes wait for it to thicken on the stove but ) remember once chilled it thickens more. Cut the pineapple chuncks smaller; that way they spread out better for serving.",
