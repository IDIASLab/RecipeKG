Gave a pan to all of my family (7 siblings) for christmas with the pan. They love them I've been told they are addicting and have been made numerous times by some of my siblings. Shrug. They loved it the bars set up after being allowed to cool. I did not find the syrup to be an issue or the time it took to make it. Nothing stuck to the pan. I used non stick pans and sprayed liberally with PAM. Came out like the recipe states and looks like the photo shown. Thanks for sharing this recipe here!!!",
