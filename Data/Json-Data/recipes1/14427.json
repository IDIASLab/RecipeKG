I added an extra clove of garlic to try to compensate. I used olive oil instead of canola, and I skipped steaming them. My husband and I like our green beans on the crunchier side, so I just cooked them in the skillet with the oil and garlic, then when they were about done added the rest of the mixture. I cooked for maybe 2 minutes more and it was perfect!",

The chili sauce in this recipe is not the flavor of spiced-up ketchup or a bowl of chili. It's the ASIAN sauce in a jar: chili garlic sauce. I didn't have any, but it was still pretty good. Not spicy at all, but that's to be expected. I'll try this one again with all the ingredients. (WOW, I can add to this review weeks later! :D) Got the right ingredient - chili garlic sauce - & it is very good. This is one we'll use over & over. My three stars earlier is now four & a half. What the heck, I'll give it a five. This one's good.",

That was easily fixed with a tablespoon of sesame oil with the canola oil, which you can really replace with any oil, and a teaspoon of oyster sauce in the soy mixture.  Then this recipe was out of this world.  I had it with an asian marinated steak, which I love,and I liked this even better.  I was mopping up the leftover sauce with the steak to get the rest of the flavor.  I also added onions and red peppers.  I made the full recipe, was eating alone and there were no leftovers of the veggies but there was of the steak.  You can really do this with any veggies.  Next I plan to make an asian chicken scampi out of this.  I've never been a major veggie fan, always having been a meat eater.  This recipe has changed that.  I'll be trying this will all sorts of veggies, meats, chicken and pasta.  Try it out for yourself and you'll agree.  I had to add this.  I'm loving this sauce and using it so much I make it in larger batches, putting it in a jar and spooning it out as needed so I don't have to keep making all the time.  Tonight I sauted some onions and red peppers in it and had it on my turkey sandwich.  Absolutely amazing.",
