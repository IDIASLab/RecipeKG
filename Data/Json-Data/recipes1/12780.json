Recommendation for those who have used pork tenderloin, boneless pork chops, etc., - you're using an expensive cut of meat when the cheap cuts work as well.  Honestly, the pork will be very tender and the flavor rich.  It only takes a small amount of work to remove the bones & fat.  The meat itself remains reasonably lean.  You will save much money by trying the pork butt, pork roast, etc.",

Throw your pork in a slow cooker with no liquid (or maybe a little water if it's a really lean cut) and cook until it's done.  Then shred it and pour in a bottle of good vinegary barbeque sauce and most of a can of cola, and leave the top off the slow cooker (should still be at high) for about an hour to thicken the sauce.  This takes out the oven step, and the soda in it is surprisingly delicious.  Of course it smells so good I can hardly wait that last hour, so I sometimes speed things up in a big skillet.  Enjoy!",

I was very tempted, like others, to just throw the sauced meat back into the crock pot--I mean, why mess up another pan, right?  Well I think it made a big, positive difference to the final product.  The time in the oven kindof browns the tips and makes it seem more like meat done on the grill.  I'd never used Sweet Baby Ray's before and it was good with the pork.  It was a little sweet, obviously--I may use Bullseye next time for a more savory change of pace.  I will definately be making this again.",

I would suggest the beginning part (cook the pork in the broth for about 10 hours and then pull the pork/drain the broth) but then I would mix the BBQ sauce right in and just warm it up....then eat it.  By marinating it over night and reheating it the pork became mush and there was hardly any texture.  I am a big texture person, so it was hard to eat that way.  I would rather have bigger chunks of pork than mush.  Otherwise, this was amazing, especially with the original Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce.  I would highly suggest making this and we will be making it again!",

I was expecting more than the bbq sauce having to give it the flavor, and plus my husband was not even interested in taking a 2nd sandwich. the second time i made it i used a 3 lb boston butt (pork shoulder) and rubbed it with 1tsp of each- seasoning salt, ground black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and sage. By the way sage goes great with pork! Then i put it in the crock pot with only 1 cup water. Didnt use beef broth because of the extra salt, water works just as perfect. let it cook on low 6-8 hrs until its fall apart perfect with a touch of the fork. take it out and let it sit for 10 minutes and discard the cooking liquids. Shred it up with 2 forks or your fingers. put it back in the crock pot, coat it with BBQ sauce (sweet baby rays :-)) and let it sit for 1 more hr on low. My husband will now eat half the pot!",
