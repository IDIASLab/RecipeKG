The drink was still a little tart and the raspberry clumps together slightly giving it lots of pulp which is not my favorite. Maybe I'll try it with Sprite next time. Or maybe if it is cooked for a bit and a little sugar added that may break down the raspberries enough for a smoother more refreshing drink.",
