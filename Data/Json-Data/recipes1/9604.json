I substituted the peanut butter chips for coarsley chopped Andes Mints candies (I've been looking for an excuse to use them) and they were to die for! Followed the rest of the recipe just about exactly (other than cutting back on the sugar just slightly). I baked them for 9 minutes, then finished with my \"perfect cookie trick\" by removing them from the oven, then dropping the pan from about 8\" in the air onto the hard countertop (Seriously! Try this!), and letting them continue-cook on the hot cookie sheet for another 2 minutes before removing them to a wire rack to cool. They were crispy on the outside, moist, chewy and decadent on the inside and all-around cookie perfection! The best part of this cookie recipe is that all of the cookies turn out exactly the same size, shape and texture. These freeze beautifully in a ziplock bag to extend the \"life\" of that fresh-baked cookie taste, and my whole family just loved them. Just a note: Don't ruin this great cookie by using stick margarine in place of the butter (that stick margarine stuff is so hydrogenated, it's one molecule away from a plastic! lol) - much, much better with the real thing. Can't wait to try other \"chips\" with this recipe in the future. Thanks for the great find!",

Soft, chewy, crispy, will all depend on how flat and how big the cookie dough balls are going in.  I did the first batch straight from the scoop and they turned out thick and soft.  A lot of people prefer their cookies this way so I can't downgrade them for that.  The second batch I used the same amount of dough but flattened them slightly (as I always do and should have stuck with here too!) - a little chewier, not quite as thick, and much better, at least for my tastes.  Peanut butter and chocolate fans who love soft cookies will love this one.",

With this said, even though I was sketchy about how this recipe might turn out with the little mistakes that were made, this recipe turned out a very nice cookie. Soft and fluffy and very nicely chocolate-y. (The raw batter was in-sane......but don't tell my kids that. Ha.) The best part is they did NOT stick to the pan AND I didn't need to chill the dough, which for me were excellent parts of this recipe. Next time, I'd like to try this with half of the butter replaced with peanut butter. I bet that would be really good. GREAT rainy day recipe to make with my son and bond. We had a BLAST and he was so proud of himself. NOTE: 350 for just about ten minutes was just right for us.",

They do not spread much. You can feel both the flavors of the peanut and the chocolate. People all have different tastes, so I did not rate it according to whether everyone loved it or not, just rated according to whether it is a good cookie that comes out the way it says it will...and it does!
