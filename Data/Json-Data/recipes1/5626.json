(The body just passes out whole flax seed and you lose the nurtitional value unless you chop or grind it) I will try it with the sunflower seeds added in the future but was out of them at this time. I used butter rather than margarine and used all freshly ground Hard White Prarie Gold Wheat. I cracked the Prarie Gold for the cracked wheat. I was boiling potatoes to mash so I poured the water off of them for the hot water in the recipe. The bread turned out great. My entire family loved it. We even made sandwiches out of it. It was suprisingly light for a bread that had seeds in it. One daughter said it made great toast. My Husband is a very picky eater and requested I send some in his lunch today. This is a bread I will bake again and again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.",

My starter is a very sweet and liquidy one -- I find that it works best if I feed 2 cups of it with a cup of flour and let sit overnight, then proceed from there.  I also found that it needs a much longer rise time.  I don't know how you get sourdough bread without any additional yeast to rise this quickly.  I give the first rise overnight, the second rise does not need quite as long.",

I have made it twice and I must have had to potent of a starter because in the first rise after the hour and a half it had tripled.... same for the second rise. Then when I put it in the pans it hardly rose at all and the bit that it did rise it fell flat after putting th egg wash on and while baking. Today I made it again this time with a more aged starter. It rose about right for the first two rises and rose good for the pan rise (although it took two hours instead of the one called for) but again fell after I put the egg wash on (I was very gentle) and baking. It didn't fall as much this time though. The bread tastes too \"sour\" and doesn't have good \"bread\" texture. (I am sure that is from falling.) I might try making this again but with half the starter called for and then just let it rise once before putting it in the pans. I am afraid to waste my time again though. sigh (BTW: Last week I made a basic sourdough bread recipe with the same sourdoug starter and it worked out perfect so I don't think it is my starter.) The bread did rise (with no extra yeast) and so many other people like it that I give it four stars. Maybe I am doing something wrong and maybe other people like bread that \"sour\".",

It worked! - it just took time and patience.  I've been baking some sort of sourdough bread weekly since then.  I love a heavy bread that is full of whole grains and this is one of those.  At first I made the bread as written but have tried variations (added oatmeal, used only molasses vs. half honey etc.).  My sourdough works best when well fed - I usually keep it in the refrigerator during the week and take it our Thursday night or Friday morning for Saturday baking.  My base (the amount kept for later baking) is a small amount (1/4 cup or so) to allow for multiple feedings of flour and water just before baking spaced about 6 to 8 hours apart.  Well fed starter makes the difference for me as to whether my bread will rise without using commercial yeast.  Before putting back into the refrigerator I feed the small amount reserved from baking (1/4 cup) with an equal amount of flour and a very small amount of water to make a very thick batter - this helps the starter to keep in the cold until taken back out a day or so before baking.",
