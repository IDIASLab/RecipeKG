It's a meatless main dish so you can add tofu or cooked chicken or pork if you like or else you can serve it as a nice side dish. I particularly liked the way the onion carmelized in the oven!

The squash and the cream cheese made a good \"sauce\" after I roasted the squash and then heated it up all mushy with the cream cheese. I added a fried onion to that too and some garlic powder -- just a touch. When I rolled all of this sauce over the noodles I thought something else was needed so I added about 1/2 cup of jarred tomato sauce then sprinkled some cheese and some bread crumbs over the whole thing. It was a good meal. Got some veggies into my kids! I'll do something like this again and appreciate the starting place.",

Of course here in New Mexico we add green chili to everything so added 3/4 cup diced fresh roasted green chili mmmm mmmm. And changed the pasta to orichi since I didn t have rigatoni.
