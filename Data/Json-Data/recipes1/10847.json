I have never had any issues finding egg chunks, as another reviewer mentioned.  I find it helps to thoroughly whip the eggs first\nI am so glad I found this recipe, I was about to submit the one from my old cookbook.  It is definately the easiest egg nog out there, and I've never had any illness from consuming the raw eggs. Thanks for posting!",

I am afraid it may ruin the taste.  This is the first egg nog I have had that wasn't commercial, and the best!  I also used egg beaters and sucralose.  For those who want it thicker, I replaced about 1/2 cup of the low-fat milk with whipping cream.  I don't have a blender so I just put everything in a 20 oz. glass with a lid and shook it very hard.  I also added a couple of ice cubes to help thicken it more.  For those with the vanilla problem, it is probably imitation vanilla vs. real vanilla.  With the imitation you need to use more.  I used two teaspoons with just 20 ozs. and I still could hardly taste it.",

(I am 64) When I bought the kind in the carton I cut it with milk because I am so used to Mom's. I came on line to find just this recipe. I think this is how egg nog is supposed to taste, although I am sure Mom used whole milk back then brought from the milk man who came every other day to put bottles in the box on the front porch. They always added whiskey or brandy to it for themselfs with just a sip for us. Hope you like it, I am going to go make some right now and put a little brandy in it to drink while I cut out my cut out cookies from the recipe from my mother in law which are the best and I will post.",
