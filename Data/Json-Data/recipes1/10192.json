The last time I made them I ran out of sugar and only ended up using about 1/2 of what was called for - they still turned out great! New additions 7/12/05: I have made these cookies at least 20 times now - I ALWAYS get asked for the recipe. I have adapted the recipe to make it even healthier...I substitute applesauce for 1/2 cup butter (only use 1/4 c. butter) and for the butter I do use it's blue bonnet light - if you do this I suggest creaming the sugars with the butter and then adding the applesauce rather than trying to cream them all at once; I also forgot to put in all the eggs one time and they still turned out great so now I use just the two egg whites and omit the 1 egg. I have also tried this with egg substitute and it's great. I use between 1/2 and 2/3 the amount of sugar called for and it is still plenty sweet. I have also made these into ice cream sandwiches - freeze cookies for 15-20 minutes after cooked then put a scoop of ice cream between the bottoms of 2 cookies. Roll in peanut butter chips and chocolate chips wrap in saran wrap and refreeze - yum!",

Also there is no need for white sugar, might as well stick only to brown since it is much healthier. Also, with the sweetness of raisins there is really no need for so much sugar. So with a simple switch to raisins and a decrease of all that sugar down to just one cup of brown sugar, you still have (guaranteed delicious and still very sweet) cookies that you can snack on with relatively no guilt! If you really care about your health or really enjoy a frequent snack I would also change white flour to whole grain flour. Taste stays the same while guilt is relatively GONE!",

Also these cookies don't spread much so flatten them before putting them in the oven. I made mine small and ended up with about 4 dozen. The dough can become very sticky and unworkable so stick it into the fridge between batches. Some changes I made: I added in 1/2 tsp of cloves and cut down the white sugar to 1/4 cup. I also put in 1c raisins 3/4c walnuts and 1/2c pecans instead of the chips. Next time I think I'll add even more nuts.",

I took some other advice and replaced 1/2 cup of butter with 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and decided to omit the white sugar all together so only using the 1 cup of brown called for. I personally found these to be perfect this way and even healthier to boot. Love the texture of these a softer type cookie but nice and dense due to all the oats.
