The flavour was great although I did overestimate the strength of the Hoisin and only substituted 2T, next time I will increase to \u00bd C.

Just before serving I quickly saut\u00e9ed \u00bd a red pepper and \u00bd a white onion, both chopped into bite sized chunks, and added it to the pork. I will also add a teaspoon more of cornstarch next time as I felt the sauce was a little too thin for the \u00beC yield of reserved juice.

We followed others' advice and doubled the pineapple. Note that the pinapple absorbed a lot of pepper and tasted quite spicy (we liked it!).",
