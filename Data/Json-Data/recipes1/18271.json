I will definitely be making this on a regular basis. Next time around I will try a few changes: (1) I tasted the concoction all the way through cooking. The flavors were fabulous with each step and continued to build on each other. However at the end when I added the parmesan cheese it covered up some of the depth of the wine chicken broth and peppers. Next time I will add less cheese or try it with none at all. (2) I will not add salt while cooking the veggies. It's pretty salty as is. (3) I'm a person that loves the sharp bite of white wine. I would like to try adding another 1/4 cup of wine and reducing the chicken stock by 1/4 cup. These are just my ideas and I will mess around with it but even without these changes the recipe was amazing. On a side note I didn't have any portabellos so I used crimini instead. They worked perfectly.",
