As a comment in response to the review that said there was too much filler in these... this is not a recipe for classis jumbo lump Chesepeake-style crabcakes. You should only use as much bread as you need to hold this mix together. You CANNOT use a \"wonder\" style bread either. All that being said...Try these. They are wonderful!",
