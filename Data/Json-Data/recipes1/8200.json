Last week I made it according to the recipe as presented (using sliced Harvard beets which I halved and Miracle Whip as the \"creamy dressing\") and it was excellent. First review: I LOVE beets. So I made this (kind of) last night for lunch today. I say kind of because instead of fresh apples I used 4 heaping Tbsp. of unsweetened Applesauce to coat the beets (mine were sliced rather than diced) and instead of \"creamy salad dressing\" I used my own buttermilk/sour cream based dressing. I also included a handful of sliced yellow onion and a handful of sliced green grapes. To my mind the walnuts (I used pre-packaged chopped) \"made\" the dish. I think this is a REAL KEEPER -- especially if allowed to chill and \"meld\" for at least 4 hours.",
