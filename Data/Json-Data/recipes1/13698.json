If you want to know more on WHY YOU CAN'T HARDLY FIND BLACK SHOE LACE LICORICE READ BELOW: In regards to the Black Shoe Lace Licorice. I called over 20 stores in my area and visited serveral with no avail. I ended up Calling Kraft Hershey Farley Sanders etc. to find out what the deal was. They don't make it anymore and gave me a number in my state to check with smaller a candy Company. They inturn helped me find the product. GOOD LUCK! The customer service depts at the big candy makers said they would put in their 2 cents for selling it around Halloween/ fall because various RECEIPES and PROJECTS CALL FOR IT.",

Also I couldn't find black licorice ropes so I used red Twizzlers Pull and Peel. Next time I'll use decorators gel and add 2 dots for nostrils for the spiders nose. I couldn't find orange crystals so I just tinted the white frosting orange and it looked fine. Recommended for Halloween parties for sure!! I hope the kids enjoy these at my son's school party!!!

Saved so much trouble of trying to stick my messy hand that would occasionally touch icing into a bag of candy! I also used regular black licorice; HOWEVER they do NOT transfer easy if you're using one of those cupcake carriers to take them somewhere. The legs get in the way so you lose a lot of space & I cut the licorice super short!:) SO... I made half spider cupcakes & then half the bat cupcakes (from this site). That way there was only a spider cupcake every other space which made it easier to stick them in whatever pan you have. The skinny licorice stuck on the sides of the cupcakes instead of on top did help them stay on longer. Try the bat cupcakes b/c they're equally cute! I like the idea of just using black piping to create the full long leg look too. I mean...who likes to eat black licorice anyway? Oh wait my husband...but most people don't;) Have fun with these and use different colored icing or even try a cupcake recipe (on this site) that has something gooey in the middle like peanut butter. They can be guts of the spider",
