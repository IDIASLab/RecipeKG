I do not add the sugar & lemon juice (really not necessary) and cook the apples & candies in a large heavy skillet on top of the stove. Just cook until tender and mash them slightly - be sure and leave some chunks for texture. Had eaten something similar at one of my husband's class reunions and decided to try making it myself. Really dresses up a holiday plate! The spices in the candy are perfect for the apples. You can increase/decrease the color and spiciness by controlling the amount of candy you add. Do try and enjoy!

Served over some vanilla ice cream they were gone in a minute---no leftovers whatsoever. Very yummy and easy to make! thank you!",
