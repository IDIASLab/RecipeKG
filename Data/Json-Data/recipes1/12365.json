I did add more chili powder and less cumin.  I also left out the red bell pepper (didn't want it too sweet) and celery (didn't have).  TIP--those who found it too soupy can add in several scoops of spicy refried beans (vegetarian) to help thicken it up--heat it for about 5 minutes after you add it and just before serving it to gauge how much you want.  Also, you can deglaze the pan with a few ounces of beer, wine, veg. or chicken stock before adding the tomatoes, etc.  Great and flexible recipe--even for the cooking impaired.  Thanks!",

I took previous reviewers' suggestions and only put 1 tsp. of cumin, but doubled the amount of chili powder and it tasted perfect.  I sauted the onions, carrots and garlic first, then transfered everything to a slow cooker and cooked for about 7 hrs.  I used \"baby\" portabello mushrooms and lessened the amount of corn.  Use low-salt or no-salt ingredients where you can.  Thanks Tianne!",
