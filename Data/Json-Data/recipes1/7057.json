Like other cooks I added lots more of the mayo curry dressing -- about two cups mayo and four tablespoons curry and it was perfect for the amount of pasta I had. I also didn't have raisins so I used \"craisins\" or dried cranberries. Subbed out pine nuts for chopped toasted almonds. I left out the tofu. This would have tasted GREAT with diced ham. I'll definitely make this again. (Oh and I added the apples in lemon juice right before serving. This was a nice way to avoid the drying-out that other cooks have noticed.)",
