                "reviewBody": "This classic sauce of sauteed butter, parsley and lemon juice is fantastic.  Definitely saute the garlic or else it will taste too raw, even after it's baked.  I have used this sauce for almost all types of fish- true cod, halibut, basa, tilapia, sole, trout, and salmon.  All tasted superb.  ALWAYS increase the garlic.  For 4 filets, I use 3 large cloves, 3-4 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoon lemon juice. Just make sure you always have less lemon juice than butter or else it will taste too lemony -even when doubling/tripling it.  For a large filet of salmon, I triple the amount.  Lightly salt and pepper the fish for more flavor and I sometimes add 2-3 tablespoon of buttered bread crumbs or finely crushed (buttered) ritz crackers for an extra crunch.  And of course, fresh parsley is better than dried and  use real butter, never margarine.  3 stars for original recipe, 5 stars for slight alterations.  Simple and flavorful marinade that still lets the flavor of the fish shine through. TIP- do NOT bake for 30 min, especially tilapia, which is so thin.  High temperature, quick cooking time is a rule of thumb for all fish.  For this, I did 400 degrees, for 10-12 min (at most!).  If filets are super thin, try 8-10 min.",

I used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves (my husband is not a huge fan of garlic) and also added onion powder.  The fish was flaky and delicious and the juices from the foil packets were so tasty over the rice we had with the fish.  Green beans rounded out the meal.

It is better with fresh parsley also.  And, it is a bit bland without a bit of salt and pepper before covering with the sauteed garlic/butter/oil mixture.  I too put the lemon juice over the fish first for a short time.  Be careful not to let it marinate too long or the fish will begin to soften (i.e.cook) due to the acid of the juice and the time for cooking will need to be shortened.  I cooked it for about 10 min. at 400.  Great!!",

Big fish farms raise fish in huge tanks. They put Tilapia in the tanks to keep the tanks clean, Tilapia eat the feces from the primary fish. After the primary fish are removed the Tilapia are harvested. A recent additional BIG money maker for the fish farms. (I got no problem with making money) That's why you see Tilapia pushed so much. They are basically a freebie to raise (no feed costs!) and almost pure profit. And almost pure.............. \"You are what you eat\" I'm just sayin'.",
