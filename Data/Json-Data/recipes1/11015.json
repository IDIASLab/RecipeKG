I made for a crowd so I doubled the broccoli (two large banded bunches) but kept the other ingredients the same and it was great. I would definitely reduce the dressing if not making so much. Can't wait to make it again! UPDATE:  I make this all the time now and it's always a hit.  You have to cut the oil by half and then its perfect.  I now use chopped red onion and also add dried cranberrys!",

I did think it was kind of oily next time I will reduce the dressing ingredients in half and add more broccoli. The texture was great the broccoli had a nice crunch to it but was not as tough as regular raw broccoli. At first I just thought it was an ok salad but as the night progressed I had to keep going back to eat more and even today I keep going into the kitchen for a bite here and there. I would recommend this to others. Enjoy!",
