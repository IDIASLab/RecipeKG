First of all the chicken I used was a bit smaller than the recipe called for so I only used one lemon which I cut into quarters. I also put a small chunk of onion in the cavity as well. The other modification I made was that the only white wine I had in the house was a plum wine which was very sweet. However the chicken still came out wonderfully and didn't taste overly fruity or sweet. It was moist and didn't have an overpowering lemon or garlic or mustard flavor. In fact the skin didn't taste like mustard at all. This is good news for anyone (like our family) who isn't too keen on Dijon mustard flavor.",

Used CAST IRON skillet, uncovered, and I believe that's important to the recipe. Baked at 425 for 15 minutes, as stated, but only another 50 minutes at 350.   It's important to TAKE CHICKEN OUT OF FRIDGE & take the chill off the bird before you put it in the oven. It takes less time to cook. ****Update 4/5/12****Okay, after reading a question from a reviewer about wine in cast iron, I checked it out. Seems NOT good for the pan to use wine undiluted, because of acidity, so I will use 1/2 wine & half water or chicken broth tonight.",
