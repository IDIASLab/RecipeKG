The dough tasted too yeasty and though it smelled just like a yummy sticky bun it didn't have the same taste. It was too dry even though I put a little extra filling inside (little more butter). I think I may try this recipe again but with less yeast and more of the butter-sugar filling.",

These are like the sticky buns I buy for 2.75 each at a local bakery. I baked in a 9X13 at 375 degrees for exactly 23 minutes. PEERRFECT! How come so few reviews? PEOPLE! TRY THIS RECIPE! You won't be sorry. I used my bread machine... didn't even need to scale this down. I have a Zojirushi and I knew it made large loaves but I didn't think it would handle this much dough.....but it did....with flying colors. Thanks Stefanie.",
