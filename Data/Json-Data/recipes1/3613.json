One can Italian-style stewed tomatoes instead of tomato paste. I also added about 5-6 oz of frozen chopped spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) to the sauteed onions, garlic and celery. I think this added to the texture and heartiness of the soup. As far as seasonings so, I added about 3/4 tsp of salt and about 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper; also a dash of chipotle Tabasco. Kept the crushed red pepper as we like spicy food. Boiled pasta separately as per several reviewers' suggestions (thanks for that, by the way) and ladled soup over this in individual bowls. It really didn't even need cheese on top. Great flavor, low fat, wonderful way to eat some vegetables and get some fiber with the beans. Thanks for an easy soup recipe that I'll be happy to make several times this fall and winter.",
