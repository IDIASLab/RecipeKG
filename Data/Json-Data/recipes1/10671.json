I made the following alterations: I used 5 eggs in all, 1/3 c. heavy cream plus 1 c. 1% milk instead of 2 cups cream, I saute'd the onion and 1 clove garlic in the bacon grease, then pressed and blotted to drain grease in fine-mesh strainer. I mixed the onion/garlic with the bacon and, on top of that, layered 5 oz. frozen chopped spinach (which I nuked for 2.5 minutes, then pressed to drain the water). I topped that with the 1 c. Swiss and, finally, the egg mixture. Oh, and my store-bought crust fell out of the freezer and cracked on the floor, so I found a recipe online for a wheat crust. It turned out pretty and DELICIOUS... better than I'd hoped. Thanks for a GREAT recipe.",

I would suggest using only 1 cup cream, because after cooking for an extra 15 minutes it was still very softish.  I sauted my onions in my bacon grease, because they are better put in cooked than raw.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  Definately let it cool for 10 minutes or longer before cutting it.",

I sauted the onions in a little butter first.  I also reduced the amount of salt based on previous suggestions.  One of the guests at the brunch said she had been making Quiche Lorraine for over 20 years and she liked this quiche better than her own!  She asked for the recipe too.  I would definitely make again, but would like to experiment with the addition of vegetables.  Very yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!",
