Waited for the fruit/nut timer to go off. TV on loud. Missed timer. Resulting bread sweet and moist but chipless. #2...Put everything in the bread machine including chips. Chips melted. Had chocolate bread. Both Boyfriend and I didn't like it. #3...Put everything in bread machine except chips. Waited for timer. Added chips. Chips STILL MELTED. Was disgusted with self. Threw batter away. #4...Added all ingredients except chips to bread machine. Selected dough only. When dough was finished kneaded chips into dough (it was VERY STICKY) put it in a greased and floured 10\" bread pan let it rise a bit baked it at 350 for about a half hour. The resulting bread was moist and nicely speckled with gooey chocolate chips. WHEW!!!:) Next time I make it I will make the dough only knead in the chips and then select the bake only function to bake it in the bread machine. It cooks more evenly in the machine it seems. Learn from my mistakes: if in fact you want chocolate CHIp bread and not chocolate bread you'll need to knead. Best of luck and thanks Heather for your recipe. My boyfriend is happy!!!!",

The chocolate chips do melt during kneeding and since I wanted chips throughout the bread I added more during the second rise cycle. I think it would actually make a great cinnamon raison bread if I substitute raisins for chocolate chips. My bf's only complaint was that it was a little dry so I may experiment a little with the ingredients to get a moister bread.",

I let the bread machine do the kneading but took it out for the bake cycle and added some more chocolate chips. It just came out of the oven (32 minutes at 350) and we had melty double chocolatey bread - mmmmm!! I also used 2 tblsp. vegetable oil instead of the butter because I didn't have the butter. It does have a very subtle but definently there cinnamon flavor it almost should be called Cinammon Chocolate Chip Bread except that I'm not a big cinnamon fan and I love this bread so that name would probably have turned me off. Next time I would wait to put the chocolate chips in - the chocolate bread is good but I think I used close to 2 cups of chocolate chips too much to be anywhere near good for you. I would still bake it in the oven but I would let it cool in the pan instead of taking it out right away so that we would get chocolate chips instead of a chocolate ribbon. Definently will be making again when I'm craving something chocolatey and sweet and don't have the butter to make cookies:)! Thanks Heather!",
