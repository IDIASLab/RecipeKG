Definitely not as rich and creamy as the full-fat fudge but still a nice chocolatey treat for those watching their fat and calories (Even my boyfriend liked it and he frowns upon anything low-fat). Also I think the trick to not ending up with rock-hard fudge is to not leave it on the burner too long. Melt it until there are no lumps remaining then pour it into the pan. The best part of this recipe is how easy it is to make! It took a matter of minutes to prepare and only a couple of hours to set up completely. Give 'er a try!!",
