I always cut mine in the pan immediately after putting the melted chips on top; otherwise it is more difficult after it is set.  I hope you enjoy these as much as my family and I have!",

Now I use rice krispies.  I heat the syrup and sugar in a big tupperware bowl in the microwave for about 90 seconds, add the peanut butter, and stir in the krispies.  I use a much larger pan---12x17 sheet pan--as my daycare kids like them MUCH thinner--and they are easier to cut into 1x1 squares!  After frosting with the melted chips, I decorate each square w/ an M&M of the current season--red and green for X-mas, etc!  Always a hit...and so easy to have all the ingredients on hand for a quick & easy treat to mix up!",

Take it off the heat and add peanut butter and krispies.  I then layer with chocolate chips and throw under a hot broil for about 1 minute and spread the melted chips over top.  turned out perfect.",
