My students were eager to learn about American customs, holidays, food etc, but less interested in food because they were sure that McD's fully represented that genre.  So I wanted to introduce real Am food. But Chinese kitchens do not have ovens, so we had to buy a toaster oven.  They also only have tiny rolling pins to make Chinese dumplings - jiaozi.  So this recipe was my answer.  Well, six years later I have made several hundred apple, pumpkin, minced meat, turkey pot, chicken pot, chocolate, blueberry, peach and probably a few other kinds of pies using this recipe.  Top crusts are made by patting out onto a piece of plastic wrap on a plate.  I have only great things to say about the results!!!  Thanks for wonderful memories, great tastes and cross-cultural fun!",

A rolling pin does make it easier to get a consistant thickness in the crust (next time) but figured I'd give it a go. Had enough dough to also make a small tart so as an experiment I prebaked the tart shell for 10 minutes before pouring the sweet potato pie in it. Both pie crusts were very good especially since they are much healthier (used canola oil). The prebaked shell had a little more texture, both were crisp and had good color around the edge. Very good flavor (not oily in my opinion) but I used the \"Pecan Sweet Potato Pie\" recipe which is sooo good that the crust is secondary. I will definitely use this recipe from now on but will use a little less oil, 1 teaspoon sugar, and less water to start. Probably prebake the crust too but either way ... very easy and healthier ... won't be going back to butter or Crisco.",

I figure I would just make one myself only to find out that I did not have any shortening and all the stores are close for Christmas. I did a search for pie crust with no shortening and found this site. What a great relief!! This is the easiest pie crust ever!! I was a bit skeptical at first considering I was going to make a crumb apple pie and a pecan pie and one of the reviews mentioned it was quite salty while another review mentioned it is best for quiche but not as a dessert pie crust. I did not want to take a chance on it being to salty so I put less salt than it asked for. I was going to try to use smart balance instead of oil but did not want to be to aggressive so I used canola oil in lieue of peanut oil. I do intend to use whole wheat flour and splenda next time and I will post a review for it when I did. Overall both apple and pecan pies turned out better than if I would have used a store bought frozen pie shell/crust. This pie crust tasted so wonderfull and especially easy and mess free. I definitely will email this recipe to everyone I know.",

That worked very well. With my second pie, I actually put the dough ball in between two pieces of wax paper and rolled it out using the palm of my hand. (I discovered that it actually works just as good, if not better than using a rolling pin.) This is too worked very well. \r\n\r\nAs for the taste, great. The texture was wonderful. It was very flaky and hearty. Unlike other reviews, I did not find the crust dry, rather it complimented my pie filling well. \r\n\r\nI will never buy another storebrand pie crust or slave again to make homemade pie crust. \r\n\r\nThis recipe was fabulous!
