Once when I was short on time I cubed the pork chops browned them in skillet then added the rest of the ingredients and sauteed until the dried cranberries were tender and the sauce had thickened enough to coat the pork. Not quite as elegant but the meat stayed tender and every piece was covered with the delectable flavor of the sauce. I like to serve with wild rice pilaf and french style green beans.",

I used dried cranberries because I wanted a more intense flavor and it was such a nice comfort food meal; perfect for impressing company! Be aware though: the cloves in this recipe are quite prominent so if you don't like them or think you don't like them I'd cut it back to a bare pinch. I love cloves so I added an extra pinch and it was perfect for me. I served these chops with fresh steamed string beans cranberry-cornbread stuffing crescent rolls and pumpkin pie for dessert; a delicious autumn meal! I posted the photo that now appears with the recipe- looks tasty doesn't it?",

They did not dry out at all - they were very attractive and were a big hit. Definitely worth it to use good quality ingredients.",

I used thin pork chops so rather than stuffing them I just spread the cranberry mixture on top and cooked 15 minutes at 400 F. I also didn't have any orange marmalade so I used strawberry spreadable fruit. I think you just need something sweet to cut the tartness of the cranberries. I didn't have any fresh or frozen so I used dried. I also didn't have ground cloves but I did have whole ones that I ground in my mortar and pestle. I think it gave the recipe a stronger clove flavor so I'll cut back a little next time on the cloves. My husband liked the pork chops and so did I. He said he wouldn't want them every week but we could have them once in a while.",
