Ok so I did a couple of other things too. I added a little vanilla and only because I didn't have enough rasberry jam I divided up the pan with rasberry then apricot and finally a blueberry jam. The out come was 3 fantastic different cookies. Make sure to cut them small. They are incredibly rich.",

The few things that I did differently were to use a combo of raspberry preserves and boysenberry preserves and I also only used 2 cups of flour. I had a lot of the pastry mixture left over so next time I'm going to make the bars in at least a 9x9 pan or larger. I think that I will also grind the nuts up to a finer consistency, too, so that the bars aren't as crunchy. Can't wait to make these again!",
