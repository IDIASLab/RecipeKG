Originally I thought there might be too much alcohol but two versions one as per the instructions and one with much less alcohol verified that the more alchol as per the original resipe was perfect. Strawberries were not in season so I used fresh pinapple in the lowest layer fresh raspberries in the middle layer and on top decorated with mandarine oranges and sprinkled with grated chocolate. I also spread a thin coating of raspberry jam at each new layer.",

I used frozen strawberries and frozen raspberries and made a puree in the blender. I used one package of yellow pound cake in a normal cake pan. I layered in different orders. It was amazing!
