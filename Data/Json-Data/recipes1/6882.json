This was the first time I made it exact to recipe as recommended including pears and it was great both ways. I weighed the fruit and found that diced and added together with dried fruits it was a level 8 quarts so I just use an 8 quart bowl for measuring fruits. I usually get 6 quarts after cooking so I think the pints yield (12 cups) might be wrong. Northern spies worked the best the 20 ouncer apples I just used were not as dense and released a lot of air in the sealing/cooling stage after processing. Curious if others have the same higher yield.",
