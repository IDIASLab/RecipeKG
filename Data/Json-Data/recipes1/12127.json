I tasted it without it and it was kind of sour. I had an orange in the freezer and cut it up and used that. I replaced the lime with a lemon also. I needed a liquid to get the mixture to blend in the blender. I added 1/4 cup of orange juice. I was able to get it to blend but it was very taxing on my mixer to break up 12 ice cubes and it is a quality blender. It was tasty and reminded me of a drink version of an Italian ice but after about 30 minutes it melted down to a glass of sweet orange juice with icy bits.",
