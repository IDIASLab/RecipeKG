After cutting the dressing in half- which is sufficent- and changing the mayo to fat-free mayo and the sugar to splenda and 1 oz. of cheese- it changed the calorie intake to about 80 calories instead of 400+.  And it tastes just as good.  My 2 cents.  Thanks for this great recipe!",

Eyeballed the veggies (there was a lot!) but kept the dressing the same. It was plenty. I only got a taste of it but really really liked what I had. Plus it was a very pretty presentation in a glass salad dish. Kind of like a 7 Layer Salad. Oh and I also put the dressing on over the cheese then added the bacon and seeds afterwards to keep them crisper.",

I used a med to lg size cauliflower equal amount of broccoli used 15 eggs 2 c. of cheese 12 oz bacon 3/4 c. white sugar 3 T. white wine vinegar and almost 2 c. of mayo. Drizzling the dressing didn't work for me it just sat on the top therefore I stirred it all together. It fit perfectly into a 4.5 qt portable. Next time I will reserve some of the cheese and bacon to sprinkle on the top after the dressing has been stirred in. I can see this recipe becoming one of my families favorites.",
