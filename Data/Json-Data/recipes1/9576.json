I had suprise guests come over, and my buddy loves my cobb salad. I left my recipes at work, and needed to make a good blue cheese dressing. I looked up this recipe and then added a tsp. of worstechire sauce, and gorgonzola cheese to make the blue cheese dressing and it was great. I saved half of the original ranch dressiing and had it woth some buffalo wings, carrot, and celery the next night, and by then it had developed a fantastic flavor. GREAT RECIPE.\n\nChef Dave",

Based on earlier reviews, I use 1/2 cup each of mayo, sour cream, and buttermilk, but otherwise leave the recipe unchanged.  It is a thicker dressing (even with the buttermilk modification), perfect for dips, but also compliments salads nicely, sticking to the salad and not gathering uselessly in the bottom of the bowl.  As others have mentioned, the flavors blend together much better after a day or two.  Have I found my Ranch Nirvana?  Not yet, but this is as close as anything else I've tried!  Thanks, Dawnia!",
