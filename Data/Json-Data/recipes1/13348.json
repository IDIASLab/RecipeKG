If you cut the bacon in half it still tastes the same, and is not quite as bad for you!\n2. always drain the bacon grease before adding the onions, and always drain the sauce from the canned beans before adding them, or the recipe comes out too soupy.\n3. I think the mustard taste is a little strong, so I cut back on the mustard just a tad.\n\nI've made this recipe several times for about 20 people, and everyone loved it!\n",

Not only was it very tasty, but it's quick and easy to make, too.\nThis was probably the first time in my life I'd taken canned baked beans (I used Bush's \"Original\"), which I like by themselves, and fixed them up to make them even better.\nI'm not a big fan of mustard, but I had a jar of Hickory Farms Sweet-Hot Mustard which I wanted to use up. It was a 2.25 oz. jar by weight, and it was probably less than 1/4 cup, but more than 1/8, I think. And I couldn't find 15 oz. cans of beans, so I used 2 16 oz. cans.\nTherefore I made this with a little more baked beans, and a little less mustard, than the recipe called for.\nFor the onion, I used a large, sweet Vidalia. After I \"finely chopped\" it, I thought there might be too much onion in the recipe, but the end result was just right.\nI did drain the oil after cooking the bacon and onions, though.\nIn the end, this was a nice, thick, not too sweet, and only slightly mustardy dish. I loved having lots of bacon and onions in there too. Thanks for a great recipe!\n",

First, 2 28oz cans of Bush Homestyle beans will make a good amount for a crowd. For my family of 5, just one can will do. I do NOT DRAIN THE CANS!!!!! You will lose flavor! Take out that nasty piece of salt pork or whatever it is. Dump the beans in a crock pot. I don't bother sauteing the onion or cooking the bacon before hand. I just cut up my bacon (1/2 lb for the 2 large cans I mentioned) and onion and put it right in with the beans. I eyeball the ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar, but I know that my ratio is different. If I had to guess, I'd say I probably use about 3/4 cup ketchup for the 2 cans of beans I mentioned earlier, 1 (maybe 2) tablespoons of mustard, and 2 or 3 loose handfuls of brown sugar. Let it cook all day on low. About an hour or so before you want to serve it, give it a taste to see if it needs anything, and if seems soupy, just turn the crock pot up for that last hour. These are the only baked beans I will eat.",
