Also used Pam first in Bundt pan, then buttered it and dusted pan with cinnamon sugar.  Used Chardonnay from a box -- so not the best quality, but it was FABULOUS.  Will definitely make again!\n\nLater review: I've made this cake about a half dozen times since first trying it in late December.  I have come across with a wonderful change.  I had pecan chips (the really fine, almost powdered ones).  I mixed those with cinnamon sugar. Coated the inside of the Bundt pan with butter, then dusted the pan with the cinnamon sugar/pecan mix.  This gives the cake such a wonderful crunchy coating, with the divine moist cake inside.  Hey, definitely worth a 15 star rating, if possible!",

Ok let me start by saying I love to make my own cakes from scratch however...this bundt cake was fantastic with a little semi-homemade kick! The cake was so moist and flavorful! The only thing I changed with the recipe was to reduce the oil by 1/4 cup and replaced it with applesauce and I followed other reviewers advice and dusted my bundt pan with cinnamon/sugar. I also made a cream cheese and white chocolate drizzle to go over the top...the entire cake was gone before I knew it!",

He is the biggest critic when it comes to what I make and he actually had three slices of it at the party. We were disappointed when my mother-in-law didn't offer to take the leftover cake home which she usually does! I dusted the bundt cake with cinnamon and sugar and it worked out great. Letting the cake cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes allowed the cake to release itself from the pan with no breaks. I also dusted the cake with powdered sugar and made the cream cheese frosting that was suggested by another reviewer. The cream cheese frosting was used sparingly on top of the cake with a little coming down the sides. In the center of the bundt cake I placed a small cup with a little water and made a flower arrangement to dress up the cake a little more. This recipe is foolproof as long as you follow the directions. Thanks for sharing!",

I wanted to know how she made it but it was a family secret not to be shared. After 25 years and the invention of computers and the \"internet\" YAHOO i entered \"wine cake\" in the browser and low and behold here is a recipe thats near close to what she baked. I spoke with my sister-in-law the other night about the recipe she has offered to give it to me but it seems its the same as this one. One difference I doubled this batch and used one box white cake mix and one box yellow cake mix. I also used 3/4 applesauce and topped off with the veggie oil. I used chardonnay although any dry wine will do. Make sure you use INSTANT pudding. I think the vanilla pudding mix gives it that added moistness. I couldn't find the exact frosting she made so I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II and added 2 tsp white wine. After frosting the cake I sprinkled chopped walnuts for a great finish. The family loved it and requests are pouring in for Christmas. Thanks Again!!",
