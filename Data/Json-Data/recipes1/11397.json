I also opted for minced garlic from the jar vs. garlic powder.  I pounded the chicken down to tenderize and to thin them out a bit before marinating them all day.  They soaked up most of the marinade.  I think using honey actually made the green onions stick better and I had no trouble with anything burning on the grill.  If you like this marinade, you'll love Unbelievable Chicken from this site.  UPDATE: I marinated sirloin steak with this marinade for 6 hours with the same modifications and it came out great.  This does work on beef or chicken!",

I used about 8 tenders, and I had to adjust the recipe slightly.  I used cider vinegar instead of white, 1 1/2 tbs. of minced onion instead of green onion, 3 tbs. of brown sugar instead of the honey, and I didn't use the ginger.  Also, I only marinated for about 2 hrs.  Let me tell you....this was sooooo yummy!  I broiled in the oven and flipped them every few minutes at first, and then as they started to really caramelize I flipped every 1 1/2 minutes....about 9 minutes total.  Moist and flavorful!!!  Not at all salty...but, I suspect if you marinated for a long time...maybe that's when the soy would become overpowering. We can't say enough about this marinade....next is chicken legs!",

When I looked at the set of ingredients though I thought that it can still be improved. Instead of using vegetable oil I used olive oil because it has better aroma and it leaves a hint of flavor in ur dishes (rather than vegetable oil which can be bland for some people). Likewise I also increased the amount of honey in the recipe (or sugar). I also used regular onions instead of green onions because the flavor or the onion bulb is stronger. Feel free to add dried herbs and spices to taste. Squeeze in lemon juice. Marinade it for 3 days before grilling or broiling or baking.",
