Smoked haddock and smoked pollack are good substitutes for the smoked cod.  Use 1 1/2 pounds fresh cod alone if no lightly smoked fish is available.  Great on cool Autumn evenings!  Serve with hot, crusty bread and garnish with fresh chives.",

Then I added the fish and cream and simmered until the cream was hot and the fish was cooked. Definitley use the fresh chives if you have them available.",
