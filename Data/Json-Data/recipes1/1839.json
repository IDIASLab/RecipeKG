I've tried other biscuit recipes on this site claiming to taste as good as R.L. and this one is pretty close. One trick I used to make them taste more like the famous seafood restaurants is brushing them with a little seasoned garlic butter after they've come out of the oven. This gives them a little extra flavor and keeps the tops moist as well. Good recipe Chaney:)",

(As one of the other cooks suggested, you can use 2 cups flour, 1 TBSP baking powder, 1/2 TSP salt, and 1/3 C butter if you do not have biscuit mix in your pantry.) However I thought the cheddar flavor was muted and not as cheesy or pronounced as I would have liked. I also found the garlic salt to add a little bit too salty of a flavor. Next time I would definitely use sharp cheddar cheese, add extra cheese, and use less garlic salt OR use garlic powder on the top instead of garlic salt",
