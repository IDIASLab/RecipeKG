Instead of turning the heat to low after adding the sauce ingredients, I recommend turning the heat up a bit and cooking until the sauce reduces and carmelizes...just be sure to stir it frequently to keep it from burning.  This way all the good sauce stays on the carrots instead of in the pan.  I also added a pinch of crushed red pepper...I like a sweet/hot combination.  Really very good!",
