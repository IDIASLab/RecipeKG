I didn't love the orange in the recommended fruit filling so next time I try this recipe it will be with a different topping: either I will modify the fruit filling and use apples or maybe try a mocha or cream cheese frosting. A few things: it makes lots of batter - it almost overflowed in my 9\" pans. This is a massive hearty cake. Also make sure you really mix in the jam or else you will get holes in your cake from where there were chunks of jam that have melted.",
