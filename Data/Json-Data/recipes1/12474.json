Great for dieters who need something sweet without the calories and moms who want to keep the kids' sugar intake down. NOTE: You really do not need the extra sugar.",

That way I can have four different flavors at the same time, and have more ready to go for later.",

I can't wait to try it with lemon flavor gelatin and lemonade drink mix. I think next time I will freeze them in small cups so we can eat them with a spoon like italian ice.
