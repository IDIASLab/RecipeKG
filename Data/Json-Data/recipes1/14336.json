Don't be afraid to use the vinegar--as long as you're using Balsamic, it won't have a \"vinegary\" taste!! I added an extra clove of garlic (because we LOVE garlic) and didn't use feta since I didn't have any (just added extra mozzarella). Be sure to let the lasagna rest for at least 25 minutes when you take it out of the oven or else you'll end up with a watery mess. Letting it rest allows the cheese to firm up enough to hold the lasagna together, and allows the veggies and pasta to absorb the juices.",

I used about 2 cups of mozzarella cheese and 1 cup of feta.  I seeded the tomatoes before I put them in which might be why I didnt have lots of excess liquid.  Also, don't put the cheese on top of the lasagna right away, but wait until the last ten minutes.  I let it bake for 35 min then added the top cheese layer and left it for 10 more min.",

I ran out of tomatoes after the very first layer =( I noticed that everyone had the problem of the veggies releasing liquid in the oven so i precooked all the veggies except the spinach. I drizzles the tomatoes with olive oil, diced garlic cloves, salt + pepper and stuck them in the oven for 20 mins. The dish was filled with liquid when i took it out i just picked out the tomatoes with tongs. I fried the zucchini and red onion in some veggie oil for a few mins so they didnt release so much liquid while baking. I also added olives and a yellow pepper to the spinach mixture. Also since i ran out of tomatoes, i used spaghetti sauce for the other layers. It was really good. You can just use some spaghetti sauce and it works just as well as tomatoes. i really loved it. im going to make it again today and i just made this yesterday!!!",

I however did have pasta sauce- I used Classico's Tomato and Basil. I substituted this for the tomatoes and just made a thin coating of it on top of the noodles or whenever called for. Other things i changed just because it was what i had or needed to use up: Frozen spinach instead of fresh (about half a bag) yellow onion instead of red 1 whole cup (at least) mozzarella inside the dish itself and more for topping 1 whole cup feta dried basil and dried oregano spoonful of minced garlic a fat pinch of fresh thyme 2 shallots just one big glug of balsamic (im not a huge fan) and three glugs of olive oil. Also this fit in a 13x9 pan all the way up to the rim and i had to end up cooking mine probably for 50 minutes. The result is fresh zesty and generally attractive. I probably wont use the Thyme next time- thought it came out too overpowering and i might add more feta to it just because i love feta. A nice medely even with the sauce instead of tomatoes- I might try it sauce-less next time just to see how it turnes out. Good way to get your veggies in and use them up before they go bad. Absolutley excellent easy versitile healthy vegetarian main dish!",
