I made some changes: basil instead of oregano, black pepper instead of lemon pepper, an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, an extra large tomato, only half an onion, and some balsamic vinegar to taste.  Next time I make it I'll probably keep those changes except that I'll use even less onion and even more tomato.  I think this recipe would be great without changes, too.  It claims to make 6 servings, but those servings must be awfully big, because this makes a lot.  I think I'd call it 8-10 servings.",

As are many others, I am guilty to modifications based on what I have in the house, as well as taste preferences.  I am into easy prep and finding shortcuts, so I used an English cucumber and didn't remove the seeds, and the tomatos were those cute baby grape tomatoes, cut in half (used approx 20); no seed removal there also.  Thanks to the advice of other reviewers here, I purchased bottled Greek dressing, and tossed in 1/2 cup. On the first try I only used 1/4 red onion, but I will upgrade that next time to 1/2.  I would also double the lemon pepper, and add more salt (I use sea salt) and a liberal dose of freshly ground black pepper.  Definitely more lemon... I will juice a full lemon next time...lemon is a leading flavor in authentic Greek cuisine, and 1 T is WAY too short.  Also tossed in some sliced Greek pepperoncini (found in the condiment aisle near the olives), approx 1/4 cup.  This is FABULOUS, and gets even better overnight.  It is also very pretty and colorful when served in a glass bowl.  Again, a keeper. Husband, kids, and picky grandkids ALL loved it.  Thanks to the original submitter of this recipe.

Also instead of using the drained marinade I added some KRAFT Greek Vinaigrette Dressing that was in the fridge. This turned out really good! I wasn't sure if my son liked artichokes or not that's why I cut them up. My boyfriend and I love them so I couldn't omit them...the boy would have to suffer! Turns out everyone loved the salad...and the kid likes artichokes! My son's girlfriend was over the day after and had some and she loved it too. I also used gemelli pasta instead of the orzo...it was awesome!! Thanks! Erin",
