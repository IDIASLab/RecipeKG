Now I've got a lot going on this weekend so I was not giving this anywhere close to the attention I should have been and that's what caused the most trouble. I dropped the measuring spoon into the bowl of water sugar and yeast. If you've ever done the same you know that the yeast clumps to EVERYTHING fingers included. I think I was able to make up for what came out with my hand and the spoon but who really knows? Then I went to beat the egg whites and in a fit of laziness I didn't wash the beaters after mixing the yeast water with the first portion of flour. Big mistake as after 10 minutes on high they never even made soft peaks. I added them anyway for lack of eggs to replace them with. At which point I read the next step and oops. Bread flour? So I did a little research and learned that all purpose flour could be substitued but the end result wouldn't have the extra chewy goodness. Figuring everything else that I screwed up already I used what I had. But I didn't use anywhere near 7 cups. After about 5.5 it just wouldn't take anymore flour. I'm baking it anyway; its on its first rising now and I'm sure it will be edible. That said even screwed up it was a lot of work! I'd love to see the end results of the actual recipe but I just don't see myself putting in that kind of time and effort.",
