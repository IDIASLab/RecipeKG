Here are some changes I made based upon other reviews I read and my own taste. 1) Instead of boiling chicken, I bought an herb-roasted chicken from the grocery store. I saut\u00e9ed the onions and peppers alone and added about 2 tsp. of taco powder at the end.  After shredding the hot chicken, I added it to that pan. 2) I put some refried beans in each enchilada. 3) For a beautiful look, I sprinkled the top with sliced black olives. 4) I used about 2 cans of enchilada sauce. Very important! Spray the bottom of the pan and pour some sauce on it before adding the rolled enchiladas. 5) I used flour instead of corn tortillas.  I moistened each tortilla with the enchilada sauce before putting it together. (Pour some sauce in a deep bowl and wipe the tortilla on both sides.) This helped keep the enchilada moist and tasty. This is beautiful! Let stand about 5 minutes before serving.",

I had a few substitutions\r\ndue to time constraints: plain nonfat yogurt\r\nfor the sour cream, ground turkey for the\r\nskinless chicken, added my own Mexican seasonings\r\nsuch as oregano, chili powder, and cumin to cut down\r\non sodium. Cheddar cheese with some cotija cheese was added in with the cottage cheese mixture for enhanced flavor. Also, I thinly sliced some  black olives and green onions and added to the top of the enchiladas the last ten minutes of cooking. Served with beans and brown rice\r\nwith  fresh tomatillo salsa on the side. Thank you\r\nfor sharing this recipe. I will share it with my friends and \r\nhave fun playing with it.   ** Spread about 1/2 cup of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of the casserole dish before preparing the enchiladas. Helps keep them\r\nmoist while baking. The important thing to remember is\r\nto use a good amount of enchilada sauce to avoid the\r\nenchiladas from drying out. That took me a long time\r\nto figure out.   COOKGIRL\r\n",

The night before, I boiled chicken in low sodium chk broth, while cooking I chopped onions, garlic and jalapeno and saved all together in a plastic bag with the chicken. The next day I came home at lunch to assemble them. I heated olive oil in skillet while I shredded the chicken then put it in the skillet with chopped veggies and added chili powder, cumin, a couple dashes of cayenne pepper and a dash of seasoning salt. I used fat free cottage cheese and light sour cream. I heated 6 flour tortillas in microwave, then assembled and topped with green enchilada sauce a bit of shredded cheese and black olive slices. Put them in the fridge and the boyfriend popped them in the oven for 30 minutes when he got home. When I got home from an evening meeting, I had a wonderful hot meal. These were to die for! So gooey but less fat. I will make these again for sure! Will use more jalapeno next time and omit the shredded cheese on top as it wasn't necessary. ",

I could have used 2 cans of enchilada sauce. Even with the ricotta substituted for the cottage cheese, this was just alright.  The enchiladas were very soggy, so maybe it would have been better had I let the enchiladas bake 10-15 min before adding the sauce.",
