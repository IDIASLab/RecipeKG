I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp omitted the nuts used 1 cup semi-sweet chips omitting the vanilla chips. I think the oil could be reduced some as the mixture was very oily and when they were cut the bottom had beads of oil. I baked for 35 minutes in a 7x11 pan. I would use this recipe again! The mix in the jar fit perfectly in a wide mouth quart jar as the instructions suggest. After sitting for 3 days in the jar my brown sugar did clump but it was still soft enough to mash with my fingers. It's a cute and delicious gift that you can throw together very quickly and your recipient will be grateful!",
