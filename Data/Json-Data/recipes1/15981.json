I added my own little twist, sauteed a couple of chopped cloves of garlic in the oil and took them out to brown the meat, added them back in with the broth and onions.  I also, \"kicked it up a notch\", by rubbing kosher salt, ground Indian Malabar peppercorns and some Emeril's Essence onto the meat before browning. Threw in some chopped celery with the veggies and it was Yummy!!\nHad that good, spicy but not SPICY, taste along with the traditional flavors, really Good!!\nWill be using this recipe again and again!  FYI; even though she doesn't specify in step 3, I used low pressure for the last 15 minutes, the veggies came out perfect!",

I made a four pound roast in an electric pressure cooker for 40 minutes on high pressure with a quick release, then threw the potatoes and carrots in for another 8 minutes on high pressure and a natural release. It was extremely tender but I had to add about a tbsp of steak seasoning, a tsp of garlic salt and finished it off with 2 tbsps of flour to the \"juice\" to make a gravy.  The next time I make it, I'd probably throw in two or three stalks of celery, some mushrooms, about four cloves of garlic, a tsp of dried basil, 1/2 tsp of thyme and maybe two bay leaves (in addition to the steak seasoning, garlic salt and flour to finish it off).",

I added a small can of V8 juice to the broth and added two stalks of celery with the onion. I added garlic powder rather than onion powder (I was out of fresh garlic) I like my vegetables a little firmer so I cooked the roast for 45 minutes, then added the vegetables and cooked for another 5-10 minutes.  I transferred everything to a serving dish, whisked 2T flour into the broth and brought it to a boil, then simmered for 10 minutes to thicken the gravy. This gave just enough time for the meat to rest before I sliced it. No leftovers!",

I put about 5 rinsed golden potatoes (whole) on top of the roast.  In a seperate bowl i mixed together 1 can beef consomme, 1 package brown mushroom gravy mix and about 2 large tbsp tomato paste, 1/4 cup water. Then i poured all of that into the cooker. I cooked it for 42 minutes and it was incredible. the potatoes were perfect! the meat fell apart. i kept the leftover meat and shredded it with whatever was left of the veggies and the last potato. the next night i simmered all of the left overs in the broth as i had a good amount. I added in cooked egg noodles and we had soup for dinner. it was amazing. this will get made very often!",
