I love the idea of blending the soup to make it creamier, because I don't have a food processor.  My friend said this soup tasted very British.  My boyfriend was unsure of the leek/mustard comb, but when he tasted it he was only too happy to finish the pot.  It was FANTASTIC scooped up with toasted french bread.",

Toward the end of simmering I still thought it tasted 'not quite there' - so I added perhaps 2-3 TBSP of apple cider vinegar. Sounds odd - but it gave it just the right tang and added a bit more depth. I recommend!",

First I cut up some Bacon (about 12 strips) fried it in the soup pot first... removed the crumbles after they were crisp and then used the bacon fat to fry up the veggies. I added some veggies from my garden... Bell Peppers Onions Leeks... after they were cooked tender I added corn starch and made a rue with the bacon fat... added water and milk and instead of using mustard powder I squeezed in some dijon mustard. Then added the carrots and potatoes. After it was all cooked through I used the immersion mixer and blended all the veggies. I used a shredded 3 cheese blend that I already hand in the fridge also added some additional spices for a little extra flavor. Cayenne paprika Cumin a little nutmeg and some basil... At the end I added the bacon crumbles back into the mix... YUMMY!!!",
