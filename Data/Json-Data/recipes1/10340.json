Make sure you grease and flour the bundt pan. I also usualy bake at 300. For frosting use another package of the pistachio pudding and a pint of heavy wipping cream, whip this into a frosting and you are good to go. You can change up and add other ingredients as you wish such as chocolate chips and cherries. Ive also changed the cake and puddng mixes to make other flavors. I also reccomend making double the frosting because it is that good. ",

I have made it a few times now and it has really grown on me...I use this combo in other flavored cakes as well.\n\nThe flavor the 1st time wasn't quite strong enough. I made a pistachio pudding icing as some of the others mentioned (turned out well) and left out the food color as it was a nice light green. I also served it with Ben and Jerry Pistachio Ice Cream, that has a real flavor kick. I like the concept and color here but it needed a little more Oomph. Garnished with Kiwi slices, looked cute.\n",
