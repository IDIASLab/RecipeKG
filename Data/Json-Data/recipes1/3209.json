Here's what I know: if you use oil/marg/butter you'll not even notice the difference so just use your preference. Usually I use 1/2 WW flour which turns out well. Per other reviews I plan to add flaxseed other seeds and raisins with cinnamon in future attempts. Until the last loaf I have been baking it in my bread machine but this time I baked it in the oven and liked the result much better (i.e. no hole in the middle of the loaf). I baked it at 325 for about 35 minutes and it turned out nicely. On the yeast issue I haven't experienced a problem of too much yeast but I use bread machine yeast (2t) which requires less than active dry yeast.",
