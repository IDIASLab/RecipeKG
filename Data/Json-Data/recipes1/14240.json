Add the remaining cream and sugar as called for. I don't have a f.p. and when I tried it the first time in my blender the berries kept getting stuck and the cream froze onto the berries.

We LOVE ice cream in this house and this is better than anything I've bought in the last ten years. Really creamy and rich tasting. I've made strawberry this time, but I plan on experimenting with fresh nectarines and peaches next. \n\nEDITED 06/12/08: I've made this with mandarin oranges AND bananas. Not quite as good as the strawberry. The mandarin oranges were drained really well, but still made this ice cream more \"ice-crystal-ly.\" The banana was a more subtle flavor, and you really didn't need a whole lot of sugar with the bananas. I think I might try fresh nectarines next, then move back to berries. The whole family is still raving about the strawberry. \n\nEDITED 06/21/08: I made a triple batch of this today with blackberry, blueberry and strawberry. Delicious! \n\nEDITED YET AGAIN: I have now made this with FF half-n-half and half the amount of sweetener only using Splenda and still have it come out great. Good dessert for someone who is either diabetic and has to watch their sugars OR someone who's trying to lose weight but still have something sweet every once and a while.",

It really only takes 5 MINUTES to make this! I made two different flavors...strawberry and peach. I have a mini 3 cup kitchen aid food processor and was concerned it might not work but it did! I had recently froze large fresh picked strawberries in the last 2 weeks. My machine did chop the fruit fairly well...and the taste was soooo goood! Some of my fruit was a bit icy. You may want to blend longer if you want a smoother fruit texture. It has a very cold thick pudding-like consistency once blended.. After reading some other reviewers suggestions I also froze for 30 minutes and even liked the texture of the ice cream more than after first blended. NEXT time I will cut back on the sugar when I use really sweet strawberries. My kids were fighting over the last bites!!",
