It's easy accurate and I can't wait to try it again using different cheeses! my subs - I cut the recipe in half used ginger snaps for graham crackers 1 T Lemon peel and 1/4 t ground ginger instead of vanilla and almond Montamore ( semi-hard with a sweet parm flavor) instead of swiss. I used 1 c custard cups topped with sliced pears a twist of fresh ground black pepper and a few chopped walnuts before baking. 325 for 30 min. No additional toppings after. Y. U. M.!!!!!! The texture and different cheese flavor is exciting! Next I'm going to see how well they freeze... Thanks for a great recipe that I'll be \"playing with\" for a long time!:)",
