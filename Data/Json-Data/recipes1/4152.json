I then followed the original directions, but I found the soup surprisingly bland and tasteless. I then added a sprinkle of celery seed (although I think adding some minced celery to the onion would be better - upon realizing that the soup was bland, I read other peanut soup recipes that used celery, so I used what I had on hand). I also added a dash of nutmeg. I garnished with chopped cilantro and chopped peanuts which looked and tasted great. I served this to an eclectic group of people (some whom I thought wouldn't be adventurous enough for peanut soup and one person who had, coincidentally, made this exact recipe herself and hadn't liked it because it was too bland, but liked mine with the additions). Everyone raved about it and most went back for seconds. ",

It's a no-brainer to fix in terms of time and ingredients. but get a good brand of peanut butter since it's such a critical ingredient. I used the Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter (chunky) other reviewers recommended. The consistency and flavor of this recipe truly will please those with discriminating taste buds.",

After we married we made it frequently until the recipe became stained torn and eventually lost. We were delighted to find it again here and made it again. It was delicious as always. We suggest substituting olive oil for margarine half and half for whipping cream. Also if you use crunchy peanut butter you have peanuts throughout the soup and needn't put any on the top as garnish; smooth peanut butter gives a more velvety texture.",
