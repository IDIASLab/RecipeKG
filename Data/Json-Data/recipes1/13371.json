I was worried it was going to be too sweet but went ahead and added all the sugar anyway.  It was perfect!  I wanted to have all the food prep work done hours before the party so to keep the sliced apples from browning I put them in a bowl of about 4 cups of water and 1/4 cup lemon juice and kept them in the fridge.  Right before I was ready to serve them I drained them and served them on a large platter with the dip in the middle.  The last apple was as white as when I first served it.",

SOLUTION: the flavor of this recipe is very close to caramel apples but it is easy to make and easy to serve to a group. Suggestions: 1. add extra caramels for added caramel flavor. 2. be sure to melt the caramels completely to avoid clumps. 3. submerge apple slices in orange or lemon juice to prevent browning. 4. I prefer to use tart apples like Granny Smith to balance out the sweetness and enhance the caramel flavor. 5. The dip refrigerates well. Enjoy! A perfect Autumn treat.",

My dip is now barely spreadable.:( When I scoop it I end up with globs that barely coat my apple slices. I also found the caramel flavor to be nonexistent. As is this dip has a STRONG cream cheese taste with just a slight hint of caramel flavor (more like an afterthought IMHO). I DEFINITELY suggest adding MORE caramel candies than called for.
