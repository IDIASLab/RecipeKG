You might try replacing one of the eggs and some of the sugar with some applesauce for a moister more flavorfully sweet bar. But overall this recipe is definitely a keeper!",

I agree they are a bit dry but what I liked even less is the \"eggy\" flavor and the texture. If I were to make this again I definitely would cut back on the eggs my gut was telling me that 4 was too many and I should have followed my instinct. Also I didn't want to add additional calories or fat to the bars but I think a glaze would help presentation. The bars will be eaten but overall this just didn't work too well for our tastes and I doubt I'll make again.",
