I don't care for \"prepared frosting\" so I improvised a little for the topping.  While the brownies were still warm, I sprinkled them with toasted chopped pecans and poured enough carmamel sauce over to cover.  I stuck the pan in the fridge and when the caramel had set I drizzled the whole thing with a type of ganache - one cup of milk chocolate chips, about a tablespoon of butter, and a good splash of half and half (would have used heavy cream but I didn't have any).  When cutting these, run your knife under hot water and dry before each cut for the neatest, \"clean cut\" brownies. Pretty to look at and even better to eat!",

                "reviewBody": "Wow - this might be the best brownie recipe I have ever tried; served at a party and everyone ate them right up including an otherwise vegan so that was really telling:) A few notes: 1) Other reviewers who suggested lining the pan with greased foil had a great tip: when it comes time to cut the brownies it is so easy with nothing broken or stuck in the pan. 2) Substitutions/changes: a) Used a dark chocolate brownie mix and added 1/2 Tbsp Grand Marnier (orange liqueur) to batter; echoed in the cream cheese layer by adding 1 tsp there; b) Doubled the cheesecake layer - in a 9x13 pan this allows the brownie and cheesecake layers to be about equal; c) for cheescake used light neufchatel cheese and fat-free sweetended condensed milk - believe me the end product is still rich and tasty you won't notice that it's lighter; d) skipped the frosting; these are so tasty and satisfying that it didn't seem necessary. 3)In my oven 45 minutes would have been too long - baked for 37 until lightly golden and look for center of cheesecake to still be slightly jiggly; after cooling allow to get cold in fridge before cutting - makes it so much easier with no mess. Thanks for a great recipe!",

Not only was the choc. not overwelming but since you have to store these in the frig if you reheat one you don't have to worry about the icing melting all over the place. Also I did nnot have a problem with the layers seperating I used pilsbury fudge brownie mix and fat free(yes!)cream cheese. Not only are these tasty but they look very nice and professional. My VERY picky 4 yr old ate 2 of these. I am very impressed with this recipe and I will make these brownies many many more time. Thank you Nancy!",

After reading about problems cutting squares I lined my pan with foil and sprayed it with oil. After it baked and cooled I lifted out the brownies and iced them.

I used a Fudge brownie mix from Duncan Hines followed the cheesecake recipe exactly except added 1 tsp lemon juice for some tang (oh yes and low fat cr. cheese) and made my own fudge frosting with 2/3 C unsweetened cocoa pwdr 3 C pwdr sugar 1 tsp vanilla and enough milk (anout 1/3 C) to make it easy to spread. Got ABSOLUTE rave reviews. I would not double the cheesecake it is roughly the same amt as the brownie. Oh yes and I would recommend less cooking time mine only took about 30 minutes.

Also I agree that using the dark and fudgy brownie mix keeps it together better and tastes better. Ms. Gervasi if you made up this recipe all by yourself you're one smart cookie.

I did read some reviews but should have read a few more of the one who stated to cook brownies first then add topping. I will attempt again as the sides and a few others were cooked and actually tasted good. I even cooked them longer then the 45min because I was worried they wouldn't be cooked through by the time i took them out the cheesecake was brown.",
