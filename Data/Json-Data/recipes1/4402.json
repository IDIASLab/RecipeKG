Since we are growing fresh cauliflower in our garden, my husband suggested I try to make some.  Not only was it simple, but out of this world.  Should you happen to get ahold of some home grown cauliflower, that is definitely the way to go.  Our neighbors said they've never had anything like it and bragged for hours.  I don't cook with unsalted butter, so, I used salted which didn't seem to hurt it.  I, too, used extra cauliflower and I did not use the cheese...didn't need it.  :)",

I made the following adjustments: 2 leeks and no onion; used half-and-half instead of cream/ did not steam the cauliflower and just added it raw to cook in the broth; served with chedder cheese as a garnish. I loved it! The result was a rich yummy and unexpected cream soup. Next time I think I'll keep the leeks cut back on the milk make sure my wine is really dry use swiss cheese and garnish with hot pepper for those that want more flavor.

I think next time I will use salted butter, add some garlic and crushed red pepper with the onions.  I will also caramelize the onions for added depth.  I'm not sure how this will mix with the thyme and tarragon but it seems to be lacking a bolder flavor.  If these modifications don't work I will try some fresh basil.  And definitely puree all of the soup, otherwise the whole vegetables are left lacking for flavor.  This is a great start to a potentially superb soup.  Oh, and definitely cut down on the liquid.  I cut the broth down to 4 cups and didn't steam the cauliflower ahead of time but let it soften in the broth to keep the flavor in the soup base and not left in a steamer.  I also used all cream hoping this would bolden the flavor.",
