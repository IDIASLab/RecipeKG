VARIATIONS: Pillsbury Moist Supreme Strawberry cake mix plus a tablespoon of berry jam. -SO TASTY!!! I made them for a party and they were loved by all (a younger favorite). Betty Crocker's Carrot Cake mix plus one cup of rolled oats... EVEN BETTER!!! It makes a ginger cookie look-alike that has a lovely spice taste and is very very good (an older favorite). Next time I will also add raisins for a sweet touch. I baked the cookies 12-14 minutes and made 44 medium perfectly round cookies (for BOTH variations)",

I split the dough added nuts to half and sprinkled those with nuts with powdered sugar after baking so people could tell the difference. All were yummy.

It's also fun to try different combinations. We liked spice cake mix and raisins the best...they taste like the best oatmeal-raisin cookies you've ever had minus the grittiness of the oatmeal. We also like golden cake mix with cinnamon chips. Chocolate cake mix with coconut wasn't that great - it would probably be better if the coconut was sprinkled on top (we mixed it in). For the kids I've used vanilla mix with m&ms and they loved it! You really don't need too much of the mix-ins...if you put in too much the dough breaks apart a little. Try these...you'll love them!",

I can't wait to try them with peanut butter chips. As far as the ingredients go I feel they are perfectly accurate. Especially if you use duncan hines brand. I do not know how the yellow cake mix will turn out but I'm not worried. Although these cookies are a close second to my favorite choc. peanut butter cup cookies on this site I will probably make these more because they're faster easier and just as good.

I'ave also made Cranberry White Chocolate Oatmeal cookies using this as the base. (1 cup each of cranberry white chocolate and 2/3 cups rolled oats)But for choclate chip cookies I always add 1 cup chopped walnuts for more flavor/texture and always get great reviews no matter what combo I use. Great to make with kids since there's not too many ingredients. Also try Devil's Food cake mix & walnuts- it's sublime. Definitely an 8 MINUTE cookie if you want it moist & chewy. It will look a little underdone coming out but will set wonderfully. Awesome quick cookie and if you don't tell people can't tell it's not from scratch.
