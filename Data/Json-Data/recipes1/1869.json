I made this in my bread machine but failed to look at the amounts prior to starting, so I ended up with a rather sticky dough since I couldn't fit the last cup of whole wheat flour in the bread machine.  My fault, certainly; there is no reason I couldn't have halved it, which is really what I should have done.  But, oh, well, no harm done, and I ended up with a somewhat hearty but not too hearty loaf (hubs didn't complain, always a huge plus) that worked well for sandwiches and toast equally.  Thanks for the recipe!",
