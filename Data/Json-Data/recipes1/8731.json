The topping on this recipe is nothing but sugar and sinks into the cupcakes and hardens.",

I've also tried them with semi-sweet and white chips. The semi-sweet melt fast so the cupcakes have a gooey center (yum!). With the white chips, you end up biting into them and I don't like that. I also add a little vanilla extract to the cake mix so it doesn't taste so much like boxed cake. I think next time I'll make the cake from scratch. These would be great with red velvet cake, too.",
