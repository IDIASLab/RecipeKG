You can substitute pretty much any flavor for the chocolate chips (peanut butter, mint, all milk chocolate or all dark) to make great fudge variations.  You can also make double-layered fudge very easily.  For example, I put 12 oz peanut butter chips and half the marshmallow in one bowl and 12 oz milk chocolate chips and half the marshmallow in another.  Then after boiling the sugar mixture, I poured half into each bowl.  I spread the milk chocolate mixture on the bottom of the pan and the peanut butter on top and ran a knife through to swirl it (I omitted the nuts).  Delicious!",

It was a little too rich in fact for my taste but it gets 5 stars from me because it's really really easy (no candy thermometer required) takes about 10 minutes from start to finish and most of the people who tried it said it was drop-dead delicious. So I suggest you give it a try and see if it's for you. You might just think it's the best fudge you've ever tasted.",

This is the first quick recipe that tastes right and it is the German chocolate that is the secret. This recipe saves so much trouble and my shoulders. I have two tips. #1; if your fudge is sugary next time add a tablespoon of light (clear) corn syrup when you begin to cook it. # 2; Don t make fudge on a rainy day. Humidity is a huge factor in fudge and fudge will need longer cooking with high humidity 5-6 minutes with low. I used one bag of milk chocolate chips one semi-sweet and the German chocolate and it tastes like my old recipe. Thank you for sharing it!",
