Add 1 cup of black olives to meat mixture and put cheddar cheese into the meat mixture. Let meat simmer for 15 minutes before putting it into pan. (I also add a bit more tomato sauce because of the simmer time) We also like it spicier so I increase the chili pepper to taste. Also add 2 tsp sugar or splenda. Put meat mixture into empty pan and top with the corn meal mixture. Bake as directed.",

Then I added one can of rinsed black beans about 2/3 cup of frozen corn kernels and instead of the tomatoes and chili seasonings I substituted one small (15 oz) can of mild enchilada sauce. I also added a small can of sliced black olives. The enchilada sauce gives this dish a lot more flavor!",

I sauteed my onion and garlic and then added my groud sirlion with 1 packet of taco seasoning. I drained 2 cans of rotel and put it in my food processor until it was smooth. I added this to my beef mixture. After this simmered for awhile I added 1 can of kidney beans with jalapenos and 1 can of mexi-corn we like spice! So I added 2 chipotle peppers that were in adobo sauce. I previously made bean and cheese \"tamales\" using Sandra Lee's recipe from Food Network. So I used her corn meal recipe: 2 cups yellow corn meal 1/2 stick butter softened 1 chicken stock 1tsp baking powder. Mash up the butter in the corn meal add stock and BP. I added salt pepper and chili powder as well. This was the perfect amount to spread over the beef/bean/corn mixture. Spread it evenly so it creates a perfectly thin layer. I spread the corn meal mixture over and baked 350 for 20 minutes and then sprinkled cheese on top and let bake 10 more minutes. This was so good. I must add that I did add a few sprinkles of corn meal to my filling because it was a little too mushy & watery. So if you have that problem just add corn meal or flour.",

I noticed some people made comments about the amount of water. I'm assuming that must be the problem. After 35 minutes of baking as instructions said, I ended up with beef filling inside a bunch of cornmeal mush. I was only able to salvage this by baking my own cornbread, removing as much filling as possible, and serving that over the cornbread as a crust. I would not suggest trying this unless someone can properly correct the proportions.",
