I added a couple of cloves of garlic, 2 stalks of finely diced celery, and 1/2 of a small onion, also finely diced. I also added about 1/2 tsp. of thyme, and about 1/2 bag of frozen mixed vegetables. I increased the cooking time to about 45-50 minutes, so that the added vegetables would get cooked. The last thing I changed was I added about 3/4 can of milk to the soup mixture to give it a little moisture so it wouldn't dry out. Am giving it 5 stars based on these adjustments. Tasted great and will make many more times.",

I sprinkled the chicken w/ kosher salt & fresh grnd pepper and spinach & herb seasoning that I get from Tastefully Simple...but you could use any herbs you like. Then I browned it over fairly high heat in butter and olive oil, removed the chicken and set aside. Added about 1/2 cup chicken broth to the pan and scraped up all those yummy bits, then added the chicken back to the pan and covered & cooked till done. Remove chicken and reduce broth by half (1/4 cup). I cooked the noodles in water and the remaining chicken broth from the can, drained & added the cut chicken to the noodles. Mixed cr. of chicken w/ herbs soup & mush soup w/ sour cream & added the reduction. Mixed that w/ a little more herb seasoning. Added chicken & noodles & combined well. Topped w/ shredded chedder and cracker crumb mixture. WOW! My husband ate 3/4 of the casserole and my children LOVED it! A definate add to the rotation! Thanks!",

A few alterations I made:  I addded 1/2 pkg Mixed Veggie (frozen) and 1/2 bag frozen broccoli and 1/2 bag of frozen Onions & Bell Peppers (seasoned Blend) that I cooked along with the pasta.  btw-I also put minced dry garlic, Italian Seanings,and Garlic-Salt-Pepper in the water when I boiled the chicken and then used that same water to cook the veggies and pasta.  I didn't measure it, just dumped some in the water to taste. It worked out very well!  BUT THE BEST ITEM--I had no ritz crackers, but I did have one package of the Parmesan Crusted Shake N Bake and a little over one cup of plain breadcrumbs that I mixed together and used instead of the crackers and butter.  It was incredible!!!  That Shake and Bake/Bread Crumb mixture gave it a little extra oomph...",
