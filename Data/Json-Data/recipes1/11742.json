Some tips or alterations I made: I added more olive oil than the recipe called for (it helps flavor the pasta) and more olives. I personally don't like raw onion so I used onion powder (liberally) instead. I was very generous with the salt (kosher) and pepper and added garlic powder as well. I can see how this might be bland if you aren't very liberal with the spices and I think even if I had used onion I'd still add the onion powder. The whole thing was VERY flavorful and had a nice blend of flavors and textures. I'd definitely make this again and add it to my \"staple summer foods.\" One thing I would warn against is eating this left over. I guess the salt sweated the water out of the cucumber and leftover this was so watery and bland it was almost inedible. Definitely eat this right after making it.",
