I also like to fill the middle. You just separate the recipe. Press half into a lightly greased 8x8 pan then spread with whatever filling you prefer. You can do peanut butter chocolate chips jam frosting whatever sounds good. Then press the second half over carefully. This is a really fun recipe to play with so get creative. Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar add sprinkles or your favorite candy or use cookie cutters and make shapes. I really like the sushi idea. Very cute! Today I made them with a variety of cereal I had on hand. I did two cups of each Rice Krispies Cheerios and Kix. My kids love them and when I make them with whole grain cereals it turns out to be a very healthy treat! Tips for the stickiness: Lightly spray your spatula knife cookie cutters and hands with a butter cooking spray. This will make it much easier to spread cut and handle the treats! Thanks for the basic recipe!",
