Contrary to the few reviews below which didn't like it I think if you put in the 1 teaspoon of the salt and baking soda there won't be a problem... It turned out quite nice on the first time. We put in 4 cups of rhubarb (as ours has done plants amazingly well this year) and then bumped everything up a little. I would probably up the amount of oats as one other person suggested to make it a little thicker. This was a great recipe that I will definitely make again.",

For the topping I increased the flour to 1 cup and decreased the salt to 1/4 tsp.  Also a little secret, I let the rhubarb soak in the sugar mixture for 15 minutes, very yummy!",
