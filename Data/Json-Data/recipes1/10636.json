My five year old helped me do this and we were STILL successful. Cutting the cheese takes like 5 minutes dipping in egg and cracker crumbs takes.. what.. 3 minutes? Putting the nice little squares in the freezer for 10 minutes.. then frying about 8 minutes on each side. WOW! That was hard? The clean up... you dump the cracker crumbs.. put the eggs down the sink - then dispose the grease. It made a mess? Obviously these people are NOT cut out for cooking. Ya think?? Try these! They are irresistible! FAST and EASY. My two year old and five year old loved them. Y-u-m-m-y!",
