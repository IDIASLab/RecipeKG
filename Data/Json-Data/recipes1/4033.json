First of all I don't have aspartame (nor would I use it if I did) so I used 4 packets of Truvia instead. I didn't refrigerate overnight (because the batter was so good I wanted to try them already!) so since the batter was still a bit runny I baked them in muffin tins instead of in cookie-form. THANKS for a great healthy recipe!",
