                "reviewBody": "I\u2019ve made cream cheese frosting countless times and have never had any issues doing so \u2013 until the last time I made cream cheese frosting.  It was considerably gloppier than I wanted it, and this was a big concern because rather than spreading it onto a sheet cake I wanted to pipe it onto cupcakes.  I had to do a LOT of doctoring to get it to an acceptable thickness and it wasn\u2019t \u201ca piece of cake\u201d (ha!)  to get it there.  I\u2019ve been spooked ever since.  Today was the day to give it another shot and I was determined not to have a repeat of this.  I did some snooping around online and came up with a couple of tricks I was eager to try.  I chose to use them on this recipe for its lesser amount of powdered sugar than most.  So\u2026tips I tried were to mix the butter and powdered sugar together first, just till the mixture is smooth. Then add the COLD cream cheese, which of course is still malleable, piece by piece, being careful only to mix just till smooth and not overbeating.  One last thing I did, just for good measure, was to limit the vanilla to just one teaspoon, as I didn\u2019t want to add any more liquid than necessary.  It all worked!  The frosting was thick, luscious and perfect for piping \u2013 it really held its shape.  I love this frosting flavor-wise too - not too sweet, yet not too tangy, but still a good, pleasantly sweet cream cheese flavor.  Since I used this to frost lime cupcakes, I infused it with a tablespoon of grated lime zest.  This stuff is goooood.",

I did follow the suggestions made by naples34102 and doubled the recipe to ensure a good amount for my two layer red and green velvet cake. The frosting came out really good. My husband approved and he is not a frosting kind of guy. It was a thick creamy result. I also added the pinch of salt to the mixture while the butter and sugar were creaming. Excellent recipe I will make this again when I make my black magic cake.",
