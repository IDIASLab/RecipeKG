We always do a chocolate cake but I'm excited to try a white cake (especially for my grandma who can no longer eat chocolate) this year. Our traditional way of decorating includes white frosting with coconut for fleece and sit the lamb in a bed of bright spring green-tinted coconut grass surrounded by jelly beans and chocolate foiled eggs. It looks so adorable! We also use jelly beans for the eyes and nose. Tradition: half of a black jellybean for each eye and half of a pink jellybean for the nose. Black works fine for the nose too. When I was little my mom would also add a flower made of icing or hardened sugar with or without a slim pretty ribbon around the little lamb's neck.",

It is perfect for that mold which is 7 3/4\" by 11 1/2\" by Nordic Ware. I highly recommend the 7 minute frosting for this cake as its brittle sugary sweetness is the perfect complement. Put coconut on the frosted cake and color some green to go around the base as grass. Don't forget the jelly bean nose and eyes (use just a 1/2 jelly bean for each eye). To make it look more like a lamb and less like a dog you can put a ribbon or some flowers around the neck. Also keep the coconut off the head so it stays more delicate looking.",

We don't like coconut so I made an almond buttercream and decorated the cake with a star tip a jellybean cut in half for the eyes and pink icing for the ears nose and mouth that I used a writing tip for.

I was too nervous we wouldn't like the cake part and wanted to try it for the first time with just us and the kids. I'm glad I did. I followed the recipe exactly I even bought the cake flour just to use for this cake. My family of four all agreed this was just a very dry flavorless cake. My 5-year old actually gave it one star:( I know the cake needs to be able to hold up so it can stand and be frosted but we just did not care for this. No one finished their slice. It did hold up nicely to being frosted and it's looks got big grins from my kids. We just didn't care for the taste.",
