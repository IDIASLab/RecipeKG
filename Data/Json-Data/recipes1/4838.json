I used bone-in chicken breasts so I had to cook the chicken a little longer. Also I cut down the oil to 1 tablespoon to reduce the fat. Wasn't even missed! The second time I used boneless chicken breasts (big time saver) and olive oil instead of vegetable oil - noticeable difference in the flavor!! Will do that again. Thanks for the recipe!",

I marinated my chicken for a few hours(any liquid works-buttermilk italian dressing etc..) then browned chicken on both sides in oil then added peppers(used red) onion garlic and did the rest as listed but never removed the chicken from the pan-I let it finish cooking in all the liquids with the rice(rice is put in uncooked not cooked) and it was super moist. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of stewed and I didn't have saffron so I used Abodo and extra Hungarian paprika(probably a little too much-it was spicy!) and I skipped the parsley. Very good dish with great flavor. Will make again and I look forward to the left-over tomorrow!",

As a chef I have to tell all of you that substituted tumeric for saffron and then complained of lack of flavor that this is the problem!! Saffron and Turmeric are NOT interchangeable. Turmeric will give you the yellow color but almost no flavor. Saffron imparts a very unique flavor to food that cannot be duplicated!! To get even more flavor out of it warm the chicken broth and steep the saffron threads in it for a few minutes before adding it to the other ingredients. This will result in more flavor as well as a more even brighter yellow color. The only thing that I would add to this recipe is some coarsely chopped green olives. Chicken thighs could also be substituted for the breasts for a moister less expensive chicken option. Remember this is Spanish style arroz con pollo and if you are looking for this to taste like something from a mexican restaurant this may not be what you are looking for. This did taste similar to paella and arroz con pollo that we had in Mallorca Spain!!",
