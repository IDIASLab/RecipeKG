Its names holds true- it tastes very much like the soup you can get in a restaurant (even better than some restaurants if you ask me.)  It was very thick, rich, and delicious!  I changed the recipe a bit and was able to cut the fat SIGNIFICANTLY.  I used 2 cans no-fat, low sodium chicken broth, skim milk instead of half and half, 1/3 cup store-bought bacon bits (added at the same time as the potato flakes so they're not crunchy), and 1 package (1 cup) 4-cheese instant mashed potato flakes.  By using cheese mashed potato flakes you don't need to use the cheddar cheese.  It still tastes very cheesey (in fact, I would not use more than one cup of the flakes) and you don't add any fat.  I estimated that by making these alterations you cut the total fat by at least 70 grams.  Even with the alterations, it was fantastic.  For those of you with cornstarch issues, I found that it was easier to chill the water and mix the cornstarch in the water before adding both.  No lumps, no pasty-ness!",

I also topped it with sharp cheddar. You will definitely want to use one whole onion finely minced. It is killer to try to chop an onion and then saute it in butter until it is soft. I am not a big onion fan.. but the soup gets a terrific flavor from the onion. I used about half of the corn starch.. I didn't want a really thick soup and it turn out great. YUM!",
