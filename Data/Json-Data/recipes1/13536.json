Thank you. They are to be tightly sealed and eaten days later for best flavour and chewy factor. My hungarian boyfriend's dad ate a plate of them in one sitting -- they are very edible. My boyfriend really likes 'em too as well as friends wanting new ways to use poppy seeds. Thanks again. Will remake many-a-times. P.S. Most important note: they're best eaten at room temperature.",

First of all the recipe says to combine cream and poppy seeds but do not boil...well it couldn't have boiled anyways because once I added all those poppy seeds there wasn't anymore cream left. I had to make sure that the poppy seeds didn't stick to the bottom of the pan and burn. After I baked my first batch I couldn't even get them off the pan they were hard as a rock. So the next bacth I tried for only 8 minutes like normal cookies but then they didn't cook. So then I tried for 15 minutes but they still turned out hard as a rock. I followed the recipe to a \"T\"",
