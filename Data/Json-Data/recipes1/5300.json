I used two cans of soup (mushroom and celery) added a lot more seasonings and because I had leftover chicken marsala from our party I used that with some of the sauce. That alone added a ton of flavor. Used a garlic cheddar leftover chips and leftover fried onions for the top. I don't even like rice yet I and my family really loved this. Daughter Ashley's boyfriend went back three times to pile up his plate. Again Paula this was great but it I felt it did need a little extra umph. Thanks!",
