My instructions were to combine all dry ingredients, make a well in the center, add all the wet ingredients, then mix.  Also, the instructions were clear about cooling, wrapping in plastic and refrigerating the loaves overnight for optimum moistness.  I have also tinkered with this endlessly to make it more Weight Watchers friendly (low fat, high fiber).  For the low fat version, change the 3.5 c flour to 2 c white, 1.5 c whole wheat flour.  Reduce sugar to 2 cups.  Reduce oil to 1/4 cup.  Add 3/4 c unsweetened applesauce.  Increase water to 3/4 cup.  No nuts or raisins.  works every time.  Makes a zillion muffins at 2 points each.  Or bread, makes 2, 9x5 loaves.  But who can eat just ONE slice?!",

This recipe is very moist, flavorful and comes out every single time.  I would suggest the following minor alterations - increase water to 1 C and decrease oil to 2/3 C.  Pour the 1 C of (boiling) water over the raisins to plump them up, then use the raisin water for more flavor.   I have been making it this way for 8 years and everybody loves it!",

Instead of plain water I used a stewed/cooled cup of unsweetened honey vanilla chai for a little more flavor. I made no other changes. I made muffins out of this recipe--I got twelve muffins that were a little on the small side. These turned out okay but for us they weren't really pumpkin-y plus they turned out a little dry. I think had I not added the chai they wouldn't have had much flavor either. This was a decent recipe but next time I'll make something with more spices and more pumpkin. Maybe it was cutting the recipe back? I really don't know and I don't have the extra ingredients to re-try this recipe.",
