I was so excited to find a recipe for these wonderful little gems.  I only put about 1/2 cup of pecans in mine and I like them pretty gooey so I bake them at 325 degrees for about 12 minutes.  They do tend to stick.  I use a nonstick mini muffin pan and spray it very well.  Baker's joy works better than anything else.  I wouldn't recommend using the paper muffin liners.  The muffins stick to them like glue.",

But most people, despite negative comments, said that they TASTED wonderful, so I decided to be brave..... Well, these are the most adorable little things to look at and to enjoy!  Worried, from comments, that I would practically have to use pliers to get them out of the pan, I sprayed with Pam AND I buttered and sugared each little cup lightly.  Since I was using a dark pan, I baked at 325.  I tied myself to the kitchen chair so that I could keep an eye on the little guys and so that nothing could go wrong!  The changes I made were due to suggestions:  I added a bit of vanilla and I used only 1/2 cup of butter which I melted (I usually melt any butter called for in a muffin recipe since it seems to yield a more tender muffin). I set the timer for 15 minutes.  Ding!  What came out of the oven were 12 perfect little muffins that were a cinch to remove from the pan!  I had enough batter for another dozen and this time I used liners (Pam-sprayed lightly).  Another pan of perfection.  Although they look prettier in liners, there was a teensy sticking problem here and there, but not enough to ruin the muffins.   Probably a bit more Pam would help.    Please, folks, try making these again if they did not work out the first time.  They are  perfect for a little tea party! So glad I accepted the challenge!",
