I was worried in particular about the amount of flour/oats in relation to the amount of liquids. I omitted the oats all together and only used one cup of flour. I didn't want them to be overkill sweet either so I cut both the white and brown sugars back to 1/4 cup. I made no other changes. Even cutting back the flour and omitting the oats the batter was quite thick. I got eight muffins from one recipe and they were really small. They baked up okay but were on the dry side. I guess I'm 0/2 at this point. Darn it. I really wanted this one to work out. Guess I should have read the reviews before making this one.",

There are many things that I think need adjusting here. First of all, the amount of leavening ie. baking soda or powder is woefully inadequate. This resulted in a small and slightly hard textured \"muffin\". I should have been clued into the fact that the muffin batter was the texture of a cookie dough. Too dry. Flavor was decent, but the texture needs some work.",
