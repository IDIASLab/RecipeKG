Every time I make this for dinner guests they rave about it. This dish is wonderful in that is tastes fancy, but it really isn't...it's very cheap and easy to make. Only thing I changed was I used shallots rather than onion because I think shallots add a richness that is just perfect for soups. I like that this recipe does not call for you to puree the soup. I like my cream of mushroom soup with big chunks of mushrooms.",

I had to add corn starch after the flour addition, as it was a little runny.  I also had a 1/2 of a lemon in the fridge, and gave the soup a few good squirts after adding the 1/2 & 1/2.  It was really good...especially with garlic toast!",
