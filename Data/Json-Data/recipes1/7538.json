But I wanted to experiment with adding baking soda so I chose Rocky's Miracle Pie Crust recipe. Premixing the flour mixture with the icewater flew in the face of everything I'd ever been taught.  Plus I figured the sugar would accelerate the browning too much.  But I took a leap of faith and tried it in a peach pie, and  WOW!  This crust far surpasses any crust I've ever made for texture and taste. And the dough was so much easier to handle that I couldn't believe it. The only change I made was to limit the salt to 1 tsp for the sake of my hypertense dad, and I thought the taste was plenty salty at that.  Also, I baked my peach pie at 400 degrees and the crust turned out a gorgeous golden color.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Rocky!  I'll never go back to Betty Crocker again!",

I also had a favorite, tried-and-true pie crust recipe.  The thought of making a slurry (??!!) from some of the flour and the water made no sense at all to me, but I just had to try and see what the other reviewers were talking about.  I followed the recipe, but instead of using shortening, I used 4 ounces of unsalted butter (one stick)and 4 ounces of lard. Butter adds a rich and wonderful flavor to pie crust, and lard produces a great flaky texture.  Well, I was blown away.  The dough is wonderful to work with, and the finished crust is drop-dead delicious and flaky.  I have NEVER made a better pie crust.  This is my new favorite.  Thanks, Rocky, you taught this old dog a new trick.",
