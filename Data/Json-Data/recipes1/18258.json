I didn\u2019t include any heat which is probably what it needs.  Maybe whisking some olive oil, the herbs with heat, then mixing would get some more flavor throughout.  When I made it I split a dozen or so cherry tomatoes and added them, which added something.  Also, toasted walnuts wouldnt be bad for some crunch.  Maybe sweet and hot walnuts?  Anyhow, really appreciate the recipe!  It was good!",
