If you are afraid of frying in butter, try spraying all over the meat with butter flavored Pam, dusting it with coating, spraying again, dusting again, and then one last spray before putting it into a hot oven on a foil lined pan. \r\n\r\nIf you are afraid of the spicy heat (or have picky kids), start off with only 1/4 teaspoon of the cayenne and add a little more to taste each time.  I like to add a pinch of crushed thyme and dried onion to the mix. \r\n\r\nThank you Kristi. You made my Ash Wednesday supper a hit.",

Thought we'd try a new way of fixing it and found this recipe. The problem with this 'breading' is that you cannot taste any fish at all.  It's sooo crunchy and it soaks up soooo much shortening that it was just blah, greasy and crunchy.  Not at all what we were looking for.  It began to get very dark on the outside, but after almost triple the recommended cooking time, the fish was still not flaky and cooked through.  Tried a second batch....exact same problem.  Definately won't be using this again.",

I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I just left it out and honestly I think it probably would've been better with it in. I thought it lacked enough flavor but my husband who is a very picky eater really loved this recipe! He said he'd like it once a week (which is a HUGE compliment for him!). I cut the fillets into strips to make \"fish sticks\" covered each strip in potato/flour mix dipped in beaten egg and then back in the potato/flour mix. I wanted a thicker crust and it worked really well. Thanks for sharing this is a good recipe!",
