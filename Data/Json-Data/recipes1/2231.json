                "reviewBody": "This was really good!  I thought it was a great idea to use rolled oats instead of pecans because pecans are so expensive.  The top tasted a lot like granola.  I thought the middle part did taste just like pecan pie and the oats on top are really good.  Only change I made was I used light corn syrup like other reviewers suggested and I used half granulated sugar and half brown sugar (which I always do for my pecan pie).  I made it in a smaller pie pan (so I halved everything) and I cooked it 40 minutes and it was done.  I think if you made the recipe in a full pie pan it definitely would need more time than that since it would be thicker, and you'd have more filling.  I found that if when you are baking it and the filling moves a whole lot because it is very liquidy in the middle, then it is not done.  It usually is done when it moves just a little when you shake it (like jello).  I did not think that this should have received a lower rating because someone cooked it incorrectly.  All ovens cook differently, so you have to figure out on your own when it looks done.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I will make it again! (I was testing it out for a fall festival and am going to make another one in a couple days.)  ",

I'm currently trying to rescue the ingredients by destroying the pie and cooking it in a jelly roll pan. We'll see how that goes. Also the portions that did cook tasted nothing like pecan pie. It tasted good but it wouldn't fool anybody not even a poor man.
