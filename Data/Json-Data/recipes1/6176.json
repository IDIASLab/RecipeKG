My only rival is my sister-in-law in Upstate New York who gave me this recipe.  My husband's family revels in their history of fine pastry and the ultimate compliment was when he told me my pie was as good as his Grandmother's had been!!!  This recipe has a lot to do with my success.  I often use white shortening for savory pies and less sweet dessert pies.  I've been known to replace a cup of white with whole wheat flour in the recipe for savory or more earthy dessert pies.  Reduce sugar for savory crust and add for very sweet crust...  I always roll it out after refrigerating.  For Thanksgiving and Christmas I usually make 1 to 3 batches at a time and freeze in individual single crust size discs (waxed paper then inserted in individual plastic bags) to use as needed.  4 to 12 pies at Thanksgiving and 4 to 6 at Christmas time!!!  Don't know how we could make it through the holidays without this one!",

My only substitutions were using rice wine vinegar but you couldn't taste it at all and I used 1/3 shortening 1/3 butter and 1/3 lard. I used this crust with the Peach-A-Berry pie filling recipe from this site. It turned out to be an amazing pie crust. It browns beautifully but not too much (I place on rack in lower 1/3 oven for this). My guests have raved about how flaky and light the crust is. One important note: I only use @ 1/4 cup of water sometimes a little more sometimes a little less... (I add a little at a time to get just the right pie crust dough consistency where it holds together when squeezed). This makes it very easy to work with. I've tried it with the recommended amount of water and with less and it just seems a lot easier to work with when using less. I use just a light dusting of flour when rolling the dough out and find that it doesn't stick at all.",
