Instead of 2 red peppers, I used 1 green and 1 red bell pepper and added approx. 2oz of chopped Pancetta for more of an Italian flare.  I love GARLIC!!  We used 4 garlic cloves.  Instead of cooking wine, I substitued 1 cup of Pinot Grigio wine. Lastly, I used approx. 1/2 cup freshley shredded Parmesan and topped with fresh basil and additional parmesan cheese.  I will definitely be making this again...SOON!!",
