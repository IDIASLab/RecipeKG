I used Bab's (below) additions and substituted a Tangerine flavored balsamic vinegar for the rice one and  1 oz. of jar jalapenos drained, to save time on a fresh one. I served the seared fresh scallops with chilled sliced avocado wedges and orange sections with the dressing drizzled over generously. On the side , baked asagio cheese asparagus and tomatoes, with soft warm garlic bread to soak up the remaining vinaigrette! Hubby gave me a 5 STAR rating! It was well worth the high cost for fresh dry scallops!",

Season right before the scallops hit the hot pan. I did strain the vinaigrette. Excellent! Thank You Chef John",

The vinaigrette was nice and light and allowed the flavor of the sea scallops to shine (even my grocery store frozen dry sea scallops...all that was available in landlocked-middleofnowhere-PA).  The only change I made was to sub yellow mustard for dijon per personal preference.  Mr. LTH is a bit of sissypants when it comes to heat, so I was concerned w/the jalap vinaigrette and cayenne, but neither really added any significant heat (in fact, next time, I think I'll keep a bit of the membrane and/or seeds from the jalaps for a bit more heat).  I'd never pan seared scallops before and, per usual, Chef John's directions were succinct and spot on.  THANK YOU for an awesome recipe, Chef John!",
