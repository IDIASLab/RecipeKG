I assembled them with the red cran/rasberry layer going into my round jello mold first followed by the lighter eggnog layer chilled it overnight. To serve I inverted it onto a serving plate lined with iceberg lettuce leaves. Overall this tastes great but does not keep its form well. It colapsed into a heap after a short while (the red layer slid off of the white layer!) Next time for Thanksgiving I will prepare this into individual size parfait type serving dishes to avoid presentation mishaps. Delicious! (Sweet enough for dessert!)",

                "reviewBody": "Yummy but allow LOTS of prep-time for this one! I had little time - started it about 7pm... then had to rush the setting process. Because my cranberry mix was jelling much faster than the eggnog mix I put it on the bottom; then the eggnog mix suddenly started jelling and I had to quickly add it to the glass bowl I used before it set. The cranberry layer would've set much better on top - as it was the eggnog mix settled into it and the cran mix never set properly. The taste was enjoyed by all but scored low in presentation due to the soupy cran layer. Will definitely make this again next year but start about 6-8 hours earlier in the day!!",
