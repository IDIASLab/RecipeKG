Put a plate over it and leave it there for 30 minutes. Then rinse the eggplant off. The salt soaks up the water somehow, yet the water rinse doesn't get through! We make a lot of baked eggplant in my house, and I always have a disaster if I skip this step to save time. (It's fine though if you're just breading and frying it).",

Then baked it longer than called for, when I stirred it I determined when it was baked enough.  As soon as it came out of the oven it was too soupy, but I let it set and the consistency was perfect.  My Italian born sister-in-law makes eggplant parmesan and the taste of this was almost the same, without so much fat.  I will use it often.",

When that failed I got creative...I added a quarter of a cup of freshly chopped herbs: rosemary thyme and basil; and 12 coursely chopped sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil with a tablespoon of their oil. I spread this new mixture across the bottom of a large lasagna pan and roasted under the broiler for 10 minutes stirring a couple of times. Now it is robust not runny. Works well with feta cheese and is an excellent compliment to the other garden vegetable filling my basket just now.",

First, I opted for an oven top saute rather than a baked dish and served it with pasta- this was perfect.  I used olive oil to bring the onion and garlic to a golden color.  I added vegetarian italian sausage (regular sausage for meat eaters would work), and instead of basil used thyme. Additionally, I added a splash of red wine (whatever you have open, I used Shiraz) and instead of the tomato paste and water, I used about a cup of store bought sauce to bring out the acidity. Though I did not try it, I agree that red pepper flakes could be a nice addition too.  I would make this again.",
