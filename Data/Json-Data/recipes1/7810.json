I agree with a previous reviewer that it would probably be too salty for us so I replaced garlic salt with garlic powder and replaced season salt with Mrs.Dash Table blend. If one is worried about the oil I'm sure it would turn out perfectly with Enova oil also. I replaced the pretzel nuggets with goldfish and kept the slim pretzels called for in the recipe then omitted the pound of mixed nuts and just stuck with peanuts. I put the dry stuff in a clean paper bag closed the top and shook it to mix them up before putting it in the cooking dishes. Then when it was done cooking I returned it to the bag and shook it again to even out the flavors of the two pans.",
