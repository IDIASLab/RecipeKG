One trick to try for those who like crispier chicken wings is to let the wings sit in the flour (in the refrigerator, or course) for at least 30 minutes, longer if you have the time. It helps the flour to stick and makes the wings crispier. This is the secret to making them just like restaurant wings!",

Although I did bake instead of fry them they still came out really crispy. I seasoned my flour and chicken w/ garlic/onion, powder salt/pepper, sprayed my foil-lined pan and wings w/ a little butter spray, and made 1.5 times the sauce. I also added the sauce in the last 15min of baking. Total bake time was 48min at 400 degrees. Slightly sweet w/ a kick of lime. Served w/ Shrimp Fried Rice II.",

With high expectations from the positive reviews and the fact we enjoy lime flavoring (Chipotle chips and salsa - yum!) we were a little disappointed... but thankfully we had regular hot wings and crab wings prepared as well. The wings actually lacked in flavoring. The lime was very strong for sure and the honey sweetness was present but it just was kind of \"there\"... no zip or wow factor. We first thought perhaps cutting back on the zest a bit would help on a second try but we all were just too not impressed to bother again. The dish was prepared as given except we allowed the flour coated wing to rest in the refrigerator about an hour in order to get the most crunch. If you are expecting a sticky glaze this is not that kind of coating. Thanks for the chance to try a new wing just can't recommend.:o)",
