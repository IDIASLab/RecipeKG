It goes well with pretzels buttery crackers pita chips or you can top thin slices of french bread with it and throw on a slice of cucumber!:) Make sure you use a saucy salsa that you love. We use a chunky hot salsa w/ plenty of tomato sauciness to it. This is one of my go-to quick snack recipes since we always have the ingredients on hand. Sometimes I'll toss in minced onion or parsley flakes or fresh minced red onion to change it up. Thanks for this delightful dip!:)",
