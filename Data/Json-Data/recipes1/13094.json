Just make sure your hot chocolate is hot enough to melt the PB so you don't end up with peanut butter chunks on the bottom of your mug. The first time I made this I didn't make the milk hot enough and the second time I just melted the PB in the microwave and it mixed in better. It's a nice tasty drink for a cold day:)",

We put warm milk crunchy peanut butter and hot chocolate mix and then mixed it in a blender. After we put marshmellows and served it. It was WONDERFUL!!!! But other then that GREAT recipe and very good idea. It tasted Butter Fingers.",
