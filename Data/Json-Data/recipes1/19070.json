If you loved the taste of Kraft&reg; pineapple cheese spread on a Ritz&reg; cracker this will really bring back comfort food memories. Makes a great potluck dish for parties. This is a big favorite at the holidays. I like to serve this with Chicken in a Biscuit&reg; type of cracker, but your favorite crackers will do very nicely.",

I love how simple this cheese ball was but I suspected it wouldn't taste like much more than cream cheese with little chunks of pineapple in it. Unfortunately, I was right. While making it, I considered adding in some of the pineapple juice for more flavor but figured it would make the mixture too loose. I also thought about toasting some coconut and mixing it in, but didn't. I wish I had; it may have jazzed it up a bit. Otherwise, it was a bit too bland to make again.",
