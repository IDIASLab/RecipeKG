I served the calamari with the \"Best Marinara Sauce Yet\" recipe and homemade tartar sauce.  A green salad completed this dinner.  This recipe is another reason why I choose Allrecipe.com's 5* recipes - just delicious!",

I had no idea how to cook with calamari but I found this recipe and made this for her for her 95th birthday.  I believe it was one of her favorite things she had eaten in recent years.  The only change I made, upon recommendation from my fish monger, was to soak the calamari in milk for 15 minutes after cutting it up but prior to dredging it in flour.  The calamari came out perfect.  I applaud this recipe for being so simple and delicious, and for allowing me to memorialize my Nana on her birthday.  Thank you!",
