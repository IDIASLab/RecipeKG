The only changes I made to the recipe were:  I used 2 cups of evaporated milk instead of regular, added salt & pepper as I was mixing the macaroni and mixture together. I spooned half of the macaroni into the casserole dish and then added a layer of shredded cheese before adding the rest of the macaroni. I topped it off with  the layer of cheese as the recipe calls for, but also sprinkled some parmasean cheese and fine bread crumbs.  I would NOT skip the bacon - it just took the dish to the next level (I even added extra!)  Will make this again real soon!",

Saut\u00e9ed them with a touch of butter and added it into the cheese sauce. 2) used light cream instead of milk. It makes the sauce thicker so i didnt need the flour. 3) I added a tablespoon of the bacon droppings to the cheese sause for a little extra flavor.  Heavenly!!",
