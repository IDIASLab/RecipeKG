Vodka won't add any taste or you could add pear liquor or a complementary flavor of some other kind. Most all of my ice cream recipes have a little alcohol in them (since I rarely use enough fat or sugar to keep the creaminess level high) in the form of rum or vodka. It works wonders.",

I froze these in dixie cups and when it was firm I stuck popsicle sticks into them. The kids and I loved these and even my popsicle snob husband liked them.

Even with those substitutions I lowered the sugar to 1/4 cup. It was still very sweet. We don't have an ice cream maker so we made the frozen yogurt in a bag. I filled a plastic gallon bag half full of ice and added 1/2 cup rock salt. I divided the yogurt mixture into three quart bags (I sometimes double bag to guard against leaks) and added them to the gallon bag. Then the kids and I wrapped the bag up in a towel and tossed it around for about ten minutes. It was a fun activity for family night!",
