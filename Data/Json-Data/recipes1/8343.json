Best investment is a good candy thermometer.  An accurate fast reading one.  Important not to stir when boiling.  I as many other people didnt, didnt dust with powdered sugar.  It would be nice to roll in fine sugar or even coarse sugar instead.  If you buy your oil at a craft store as i did, you get 2 small bottles and they are each ONE DRAM.  If you half this recipe, you should use a whole dram for a great flavor.  Your entire house will smell of cinnamon for a while...but its great.  MUST USE OIL, and not extract.  Oil is concentrated and tastes better.  Cant wait to try other flavors.  I have peppermint and want to try strawberry.  Give this one a try, you'll love it!!!  Also, use parchment paper, SOOOO MUCH easier than foil!!!!!!",

I used extracts you buy at the store and made a batch of banana, peppermint, orange, strawberry, vanilla nut, raspberry and butter rum.\nI don't have a candy thermometer so if you boil on medium heat until you can take a small spoon of the mixture and drop it into a bowl of cold water and it instantly hardens - that's a good temperature. Make sure you use a lot of powdered sugar on the foil so it doesn't stick. It takes about an hour or 2 to harden all the way, but you know you did it right if you can touch it and it's hard after a half hour or so. I made half recipes instead of what is above in case one of them didn't turn out, plus it made a lot.",
