I added an half can of tomato soup that was in my refrigerator and a can of beef consomme when it needed additional liquid. I used \"famous taco seasoning mix\" found here and a half tsp of cocoa powder and a pinch of oregano. You definitely want to add the sour cream and the cheese as it mellows the heat and finishes the dish. Sliced avocado would have been all I needed to make it better. I topped this with some crispy tortilla chips YUM!.Thanks I will be making this again and again!",
