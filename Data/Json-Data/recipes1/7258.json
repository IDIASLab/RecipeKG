I use half cinnamon and half pumpkin pie spice for the spices. I like to double the raisins. I also zest the lemons and oranges before peeling instead of using the candied citron. A food processor makes fast work of this recipe. I have also added spiced rum in the last 15 minutes of cooking which adds a nice depth to the flavour. Great way to use up green tomatoes! FYI I use metric measurements and a digital scale since the submitter uses weight and volume measurements it is easier. I weigh my green tomatoes first and then adjustment servings from that weight. There are 1000 grams in a kg so it is easy to figure out.",

I love mincemeat pie and will love giving jars of mincemeat for Christmas. I scaled it back to 40 servings and used all of the ingredients called for. I sampled it before I canned and am anxious to make a pie come Thanksgiving or Christmas. It may need a little thickening before putting in a pie as filling.",

It is great as a pie filling but we like it as a pancake waffle or ice cream topping too. You don't HAVE to add the suet to this recipe and it is still great.

I have a meat grinder and put everything through the meat chopper using a 3/8\" blade. It was perfect. I boiled it the 3 hrs. and then processed in a boiling water bath. Don't be afraid to try it!",

                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe today. I have not put it into any baked goods yet but when I do I think I will be inclined to mix it with store-bought mincemeat. The smell is lovely but it did not cook up like I expected. The texture is more like \"real\" mincemeat which is how my family refers to mincemeat with meat in it. I found the recipe difficult to figure out as per my earlier posting. Weight for the tomatoes and apples would have been much more helpful. I had no idea how many to use. In the end I went with what my soup pot could hold. I used 3 kilos of tomatoes and 3 kilos of apples. I cut everything else in half except the raisins. I used all the raisins. When I saw how full it was at that point I cannot imagine what size pot one would need for twice as many apples and tomatoes. I also added about 1/2 lb currants and 1 lb each of red cherries and green cherries. We'll see how it bakes up in tarts or muffins. If I have any further tips after I do that I will post again.",
