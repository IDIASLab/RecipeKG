After seeing the reviews on the vinegar based sauce I decided to omit it altogether and punch up the flavor of the marinade to compensate. I used Greek yogurt, smoked paprika, fresh lemon juice, Sriracha (2 tablespoons), salt, fresh ground pepper, plus the garlic, olive oil, and cayenne.  Be sure to spray your grill with non-stick cooking spray before turning it on or it will stick like crazy. Nice color, super tender, and delicious!",

I marked this down a star because the 'glaze' has a lot more Olive Oil than it really needs and makes far too much for the chicken.

I added two good pinches of Salt to the marinade per other reviews. My Sister had brought me a large bag of Paprika from her trip to Hungary. I can't read the label....so we didn't know that it was HOT Paprika. I did not make the glaze - it didn't need it. I didn't do such a great job at wiping off the marinade either. Just threw the chicken on the hot grill. I kept moving the Chicken around the grill so it didn't blacken. I used boneless skinless breasts and thighs. Something different to do with Chicken! YEA!
