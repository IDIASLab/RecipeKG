Works like a charm, and you can remove it when you slice everyone their piece.  BUT I also take it out at the 1hr mark and drain the excess liquid.  I double the sauce, but only to drizzle on top of everyone's slice since my kids&husband like to slather their meatloaf w/ketchup.  When I do double the topping, I add 1T lemon juice OR 1T balsamic vinegar for yummiest topping! Substitute bread for 3/4C oats & use green onions instead of onions if you've got picky eaters.  Sometimes I dice green peppers too for more flavor.  If you haven't tried \"Honey Roasted Red Potatoes\" I'd recommend trying them along side, and you're sure to be everyone's best friend. All my picky eaters tell me I'm the greatest cook ever due to everyone's great reviews!  This meatloaf was liked by everyone over the two other top rated ones on this site! I also make them in muffin cups and just baked at 375 for 30 min.",

After tasting this for dinner last night, they both said don't try any more, this one is the best! As for substitutions, I added 3/4 c. of oats in place of the bread, and used balsamic vinegar in place of the lemon juice. Next time I will try the lemon juice, but the vinegar worked fine and I happened to be out of lemons. Oh, one great tip that I got from another reviewer is to line the bottom of your 9x5 pan with bread slices when making a meatloaf. The bread soaks up all the fat and then you just throw the bread away. Works great!",

I also didnt have bread so I substituted that for a cup of oats. Dry mustard was traded in for yellow mustard. I've hated meatloaf for as long as I can remember but what I made last night was excellent. The glaze made all the difference, it was amazing. After reading the reviews I made a double batch of glaze and it covered the loaf beautifully. Definatly a keeper!",

What I do is preheat the oven to 325 and put the meatloaf in w/o the glaze for 10 minutes, then i glaze it and insert a oven safe thermometer and cook the meatloaf to 155. Comes out perfect everytime. I also use just plain unseasoned breadcrumbs instead of whole slices of bread shredded. \n\nAlso I forgot to add that I do not cook it in a loaf pan. I form the loaf in the pan then take it out and put it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Keeps the meatloaf from collecting all the fat runoff.",

The lemon added a wonderful touch without being overpowering at all. I love the topping, and have made other glazes like it, but never thought to add lemon juice. My husband normally will grin and bear meatloaf night. Not this time. He loved it so much that there aren't any leftovers for a meatloaf sandwich in my lunch tomorrow! I highly recommend this great recipe!!! The only thing I did differently is add 1/4 cup French's Fried Onions crumbled up into it because I don't like chopping onions.",

I think what happened is that I increased the sauce per everyone's suggestion, and then still included 1/3 of it in with the meat.  In retrospect, I probably should have not put that much of the sauce in with meat.  Still, this was very very good and smelled wonderfully.  My kids loved as well.
