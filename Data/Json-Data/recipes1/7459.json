I used about ten medium Cortland apples, which are kind of tart, I added a tsp of vanilla, and I made one and half times the amounts for the crisp part.  It totally filled a Pampered Chef 9x13 stoneware dish.  This recipe was just wonderful.  I served it to company who couldn't get enough, I shared with neighbors who raved, and my family ate it for dessert a couple of nights in a row.  Just lucious!!  Try this one - you won't be sorry!",

                "reviewBody": "Bingo! This recipe works. OK, it\u2019s roughhewn enough for we guys to take a hack at it, here are some guy tricks to cover a variety of Macho Mistakes. You forgot to set out the butter for 10 minutes so it can soften? Recovery: Place the BIG mixing bowl on the stove over the oven that\u2019s heating. That will soften the butter as you mix. Get the BIGGIST whisk you have and use it to knock the chunks of butter down to pea sized bits. Stop mixing at this point. DO NOT pre-melt the butter. DO NOT whisk the butter until you have a smooth mixture. This stops the crisp and makes dough. Recovery: If you do the dough thing, serve with bigger glasses of milk OR use more cream on the dish. HINT: If you serve the dish warm, then put the cream you\u2019re going to pour on it in the microwave on 40% power for 1 minute to knock off the chill. DO NOT boil the cream. More HINTS: (1) Cut slices no finer than about 1/4\u201d thick; it helps them to retain \u201capple-ness\u201d. (2) After you put the bottom layer of crisp in the baking dish and pour in the apples, PRESS the apples down into the crisp and then press the top layer of crisp dough down into the apples as well. DO NOT crush the apples. The apples will flavor the dough a bit, and there\u2019ll be a better crisp to apple slice ratio as well. (3) DO hold about a \u00bc cup of the sugar to pour directly on the apple slices in a bowl and then mix well. (4) DO NOT bake till crust is brown. STOP when apples are tender. Manly Kitchen Mess Rating: No better than 2 out of 10.",
