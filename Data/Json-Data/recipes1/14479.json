Both times, I baked the squash first, just putting the whole thing in the oven at 375 for about an hour.  The skin just peels itself off!  Very easy.  I also left out the celery both times.\n\nThe first time, I replaced the potatoes with sweet potatoes and added some garlic and a pinch of curry powder.  It was absolutely delicious and very hearty served with a big dollop of sour cream (the sour cream is a MUST).\n\nThe second time, I made it just with butternut squash (no carrots, no potatoes) and it was even better.  I added some cayenne powder for heat and a little nutmeg.  I mixed the sour cream  right into the soup this time - I'll definitely make this again.",

The celery adds wonderful flavor; I wouldn't omit that as others suggest. I use a hand blender (the kind that looks like a wand) to blend it right in the pot so there's no messy transfer or blender to clean. If you pur\u00e9e soups often the hand blender is very useful.",

I always end up finding some very useful tips that perfect the outcome of a recipe. The following advice from other reviews were very helpful:\n1. Use 1 potato, omit the potato all together, or add sweet potato instead.\n2. For easy dicing, roast the butternut squash in a 400 degree oven for one hour, turning it every 15 minutes.\n2. For a more flavorful soup, Add 1-2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, a 1/2 tsp of curry, a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.\n3. Add another 1/2 cup of broth for a thinner consistency after you puree it (but, you be the judge of that).\n4.  Pureeing it gives it a texture similar to baby food, so you may want to leave some chunks in the soup. \nLastly, If you love squash, you HAVE to try this soup.  My husband was looking for the leftovers the next day and called me a \"dirty dog\" for sending them home with my son.  I regret doing that as well!",

So I added spices red pepper flakes and some steamed broccoli......Still found it lacking. Then I added some sour cream. OMG, that was the secret. Really good. So I gave it 4 stars because it was, after all, a very good base. I plan to freeze some and see how that does. (7/18/07) After freezing this soup I decided that, although it was better fresh, it was still one of the recipes I will add to my list of foods I can freeze.(10/04/07) Don't bother to bake the squash. Cut it in half, remove seeds and pulp, place it in a dish, cut side down, with 1/2 inch of water and microwave for 12 to 15 minutes. Works very well!",
