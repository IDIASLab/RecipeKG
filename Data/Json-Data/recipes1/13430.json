You need fleshy meaty tomatoes- not the ones filled with seed pockets and juice. Don't expect supermarket tomatoes to fry well. They've probably been frozen and will be mealy. Get your green toms from your garden or a farmer and view the cut open flesh.\"Big Boy\" and \"Beefsteak\" are two types that fry well when green. I salt the slices to drain off some of the moisture and bitterness before I bread or batter them. Some folks like the acidity and use buttermilk to increase it. Fried green toms are considered a southern \"curiosity\" but it's really just a variation on the centuries old fried eggplant and tastes almost identical (Try a few sprinkles of basil oregano and Parmesean cheese on the toms!). I fry my green toms in olive oil (not EVOO) and/or other oil blends depending on the flavor I want. Traditionally in the south bacon grease or lard would've been used to fry 'em in and I sometimes go with tradition. I find Olive oil garlic and Toms are \"naturals\" together. Buy when the price is low and freeze them. They can be preped breaded and frozen on sheet pans or waxed paper then bagged and fried from the freezer just like eggplant or Okra...try green tomato \"chips\" from your dehydrator!",
