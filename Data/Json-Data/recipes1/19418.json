Thankfully the veggies add quite a bit of flavor to the dish because the chicken is bland bland bland. I even added two crushed gloves of garlic to the mix. To get more flavor it'd be beneficial to marinate the chicken in the oil and vinegar mix for a few hours but I guess that defeats the purpose of a quick last minute meal. I cooked everything for 12 minutes. The recipe ready veggies are very handy however I miss the crunch of fresh veggies.",

I read a few reviews before I broiled it and figured I should take heed to what was mentioned most. Most reviewers stated the chicken needed more seasoning. I lightly used creole seasoning on both sides of my boneless chicken. I followed the ingredients as it was called but I poured more balsamic vinegar on the chicken and the veggies. This dish was all about flavor considering it is a broiled dish. I noticed my chicken was cooking too fast. Therefore I broiled it on Low. The high setting was burning the outside and the inside was pink. My chicken was frozen. Once it thawed in the oven I applied the creole seasoning to ensure it wouldn't be bland. I think it cooked broiled for 20 minutes. Guys my husband thought it was good! It's a winner in my house. I don't think I would change anything I did.",
