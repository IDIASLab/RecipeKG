I served this with baked potatoes and putting the balsamic mixture/onions/mushrooms/ was the best part. I'm not ready to give up on this recipe but it needs some tinkering.",

I think the \"too vinegary\" reviews may have been caused by not allowing the balsamic to reduce enough, because it was very sweet tasting if allowed to reduce about as much as the recipe says (by 1/2).  I used 3/4C of balsamic like other reviewers, so perhaps that was it.  Anyway, very easy and good weeknight dinner with sweet potatoes and corn!",

The balsamic vinegar sure smelled potent during and directly after cooking but it tasted just fine on the steak. Thanks",
