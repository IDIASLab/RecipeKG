I added freash zucchini yellow squash cherry tomatoes and 1 red pepper yellow pepper and orange pepper and mushrooms in place of the frozen vegetables. I grilled the vegetables in a wok rack on our outside grill with Italian dressing. I marinated the vegetables in the frig. first for about 30 min. And the vegetables are better the next day for leftovers ----if-- there's anything left over.Thanks so much for the recipe. It's a keeper.",
