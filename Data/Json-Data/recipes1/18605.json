To the mix, I also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. I mixed all the wet ingredients in a bowl, then added the bread cubes to coat in the egg mixture, before putting it into my cooker. I may have left it on a bit longer than called for and then just put it on warm until I was ready to serve it. Very moist, and great flavor I think I would maybe add a bit more sugar if using plain bread, but since the Irish soad bread was already sweetened, it was fine...I can't believe this dessert came out of a crockpot, lol. This is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I used 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of the white sugar, I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg, and I upped the vanilla extract to 1 teaspoon. So, so good!!! I did use the raisins (a must for me in bread pudding!), but because this was going to be a dessert for us, I soaked the raisins in rum for about 1/2 hour before adding to the crock pot (SO good!). But next time I might also throw in some chopped apples just for variety. Anyway, this is a great recipe (that I tweaked to my personal preference, but I bet it is also great as written). Oh, and I also sprayed my crock pot with butter flavored non-stick spray prior to adding ingredients and cleanup was a breeze!",

I added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 2 Tbsp. of real maple syrup.  I also switched the nutmeg to cinnamon, just because of personal preferance.   I also served additional maple syrup on the side.  I didn't need it as I felt is was sweet enough, but others added a bit.  I can't wait to make this again, and again, and again!!!  Next time I will spray the sides of the crockpot with cooking spray, especially if I plan to keep it on warm for any period of time.  Thanks for this awesome, and super easy recipe!!!",
