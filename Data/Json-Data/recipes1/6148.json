Don't just trash it - try it again - Experiment with the ingredients to find the right flavor for your tastebuds. You might just find a winner recipe melting in your mouth. Happy Cooking !!!!! ~MA~",

I suspect that those who did not like the flavor might have used imitation extracts instead of pure extracts. The difference between the two is exponential. I don't allow imitation anything in my house. Had I made the icing with imitation extract I would have spit it out myself.\n\nI feel it is unnecessary to melt the butter, just get it to room temp first before adding to the cream cheese.\n\nIf you like cream cheese icing, there's nothing not to like with this recipe. I did not increase the amounts of anything in this recipe and found it a nice side complement to the Martha Stewart Spicy Pumpkin Bundt Cake Recipe which is excellent. Also followed that recipe exactly.\n\nThere is not much volume because this has less butter and sugar than normal cream cheese icing so if you need a lot, double the recipe or consider adding more brown sugar and butter. It was not grainy at all. The since all the ingredients are room temp, the sugar dissolves and blends in just fine.\n\nI used honey that was created locally, not commercial mass marketed honey.\n\nI don't think this recipe needs more sugar. The point is to eat it with the cake in your mouth which has sugar in it already. You'll find the flavors meld well. But if you eat it alone, don't expect it to taste like high fructose processed icing from a container. It tastes like cream ",

I made it with the full amount of almond extract and it is good but you have to like almond extract. You could easily do with out it. There is enough flavor there with the vanilla ceam cheese and honey. I put this frosting on the onebowl chocolate cake III on this site (made cupcakes with hot coffee substituted for the boiling water) It made an intense dark chocolate flavor and so I needed a not so sweet but flavorful frosting.

I read the reviews and noted that some people said there wasn't enough to frost a whole cake and as I was frosting a two-layer 9-inch round cake I added half of another package of cream cheese just in case (and adjusted other ingredients accordingly). It's a good thing I did - I would have had to REALLY stretch if I had made it as written and I don't load my cakes with frosting either. Also I didn't have almond extract but I think it would have been divine if I had. If you're looking for a super-sweet sugary frosting this isn't it.
