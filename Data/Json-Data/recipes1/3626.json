                "reviewBody": "I remembered (too late) the reason that tomatoes should be added at the END of the cooking: dried beans don't get soft if acid (vinegar tomatoes etc.) are added before the beans are soft. I thought it was odd but followed the recipe almost exactly (no ham was wasted at least) because of all the good reviews. When I re-read the reviews I noticed a lot of the reviewers mentioned using canned beans and maybe others used them also. So important tips: Canned Beans - Use less water (go by looks you can add more later if you need it) and a lot less salt. No need to cook 2 hours. Carrots - I followed the recipe and I thought the grated carrots looked very unappetizing in the cooked soup. Chopped work much better. Dried beans - Either soak the beans overnight or quick soak (boil 10 minutes then let sit covered for and hour). DO NOT ADD TOMATOES until the beans are soft. TOO LATE? If you've already been cooking the recipe as written for 2 to 3 hours when you read this and still can't stomach the firm beans you can put the beans in a blender if you didn't add the ham. I used some of the blended beans to make the Black Bean Vegetable Soup from the site. If I hadn't had those additional ingredients I would have had to order pizza.",

I followed some of the other reviewers recommendation of adding a neckbone or ham hock to the soup and cutting back on the salt content. I omitted the salt and increased the celery salt from 1 teaspoon to 2 teaspoon. I also added more cayenne pepper to add some spice. I must say all of the ingredients for this soup was easy to find and I had the majority of it on hand. I will definitely make this soup again. The flavor is GREAT and so easy to fix! Thanks!",

My mistake there was that I should have use 8 cups of water/broth instead of 10. And instead of diced tomatoes I used about 2 cups of salsa which I didn't add until about 2.5 hours later when the beans were cooked through (since the acid in tomatoes doesn't let beans cook through). Then I blended a little bit of the soup with an immersion blender just to make it a little smoother. Can't wait to have it for lunch today!",

I typically blend 1/2 of my soup(s) w/ an infusion blender to thicken but I would NOT recommend that w/ this recipe b/c you'll get a grainy texture (I tried it). Also I might suggest one remember that black beans are firm & need alot of soak/simmer time. I soaked mine overnight & also simmered for several hours b/c I like them on softer side. THANX Angchick.
