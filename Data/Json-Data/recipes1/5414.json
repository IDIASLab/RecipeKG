I agree that the recipe is a little hard to follow, so here are a few things that might help: I got two cups of egg whites from 15 medium-to-large eggs; I added the vanilla with the salt and cream of tartar instead of at the end to avoid having to overstir the batter; and I used an ungreased tube pan that I inverted on a glass bottle once it came out of the oven -- let it cool completely and then run a knife around the edges to remove from the pan. Also, I didn't have cake flour, so I substituted by mixing 2 tablespoons of corn starch with enough all-purpose flour to make 1 cup total (1-1/2 teaspoon CS per quarter cup APF) -- the easiest way to do this is to put the corn starch in the bottom of the measuring cup and then to fill with AP flour. This substitution worked great. ",

The eggs whipped up so high they nearly spilled over my kitchen aid mixer bowl but the texture of the cake was light and soft without being chewy--just the way an angel food cake should be. Oh and I mixed in about 6 oz. of mini chocolate chips. Once cooled I drizzled a chocolate ganache from this site over the top and sides. Some shaved chocolate swirls completed a lovely and (mostly) healthy birthday cake for my mom that every body loved.",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent cake. Only thing I did different was I added the vanilla after I beat in the white sugar. I folded it in with a spatula. ALthough some complained it is best when a recipe asks for egg whites in cups rather than in number of egg whites. That can vary too much because of the size of the egg. In general you will get 2 cups of whites out of anywhere from 14-16 large eggs. For those not sure what the mixture is supposed to look like at the various stages you need to check a cookbook or look for photos online. It is hard to describe. That is not the fault of the author. I have served this cake plain with ice cream and with whipped cream and raspberry sauce. It is loved all ways!!! Enjoy this great recipe!!!! Suggestion: After whipping up the egg whites transfer to a very large bowl before you add the flour. Otherwise it will be very difficult to do. This recipe makes a large volume of egg whites.",

But I did make a couple of changes: I cut down the powdered sugar to 3/4 cup and substituted Ghiradelli sweetened cocoa powder 2 TB dark cocoa. Also reduced vanilla to 1 tsp and added a tsp of Kahlua adding them before the flour. Mixing speed is important. Instead of using high speed to beat the egg whites start on low speed until the whites are broken down and frothy; add salt and cream of tartar and beat at medium speed until the egg whites form billowy mounds. Add sugar 2 TB at a time keeping speed set to medium until all sugar is incorporated and soft peaks form. DO NOT beat until egg whites are stiff; that makes it hard to fold the flour in without deflating the mixture.",
