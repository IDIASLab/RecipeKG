They may not be gourmet or exotic but their so easy you're more likely to make them and be more loved by your friends! In my case I don't have time Sunday morning for a complicated recipe so this one is best. A couple of times I used chocolate cake mix for \"chocolate chocolate cookies\" and these were the most popular with my family. I've make them with a big spoon when I didn't have access to a electric mixer and they were just fine. I think they turn out better if you keep the dough chilled. I think they're better if they're slightly under-baked so they stay soft.",
