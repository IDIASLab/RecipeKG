                "reviewBody": "Very yummy recipe!  It's a keeper.  Prepare the pudding mix according to package directions though before folding in the whip topping and sour cream.  The recipe didn't state that. I soaked my bananas in the pineapple juice, but didn't use the crushed pineapple in the trifle.  Instead, I just used fresh strawberries, fresh raspberries and blueberries, and the pineapple-soaked bananas.  Use whatever fruit is in season. Peaches would be great with this too. I garnished with the reserved berries and a light dusting of cocoa powder.  I used just one 9\" angel food cake, but I suggest using 2 angel food cakes for more heartiness.  Also don't bother slicing the angel food cakes into layers. Just cut into cubes, or break off pieces of angel food cake, and layer it that way.  This dessert was fabulous! No leftovers.  The creamed filling/topping is simply delicious.  I suggest assembling and keeping the trifle in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or more to let the flavors develop before serving.  The filling will seep into the layers of the fruits and meld with everything.  My husband showed off my creation to our guests, as I had served it in a trifle pedestal bowl.  It not only looked gorgeous, but it tasted just as awesome! P.S. You might end up with extra angel food cake (if you use 2 cakes to layer with), and unused filling. I highly suggest you make your own little trifle on the side w/the extras, to keep for yourself because your guests will eat up the main one :)",

I highly recommend this as an alternative to plain angel food. 2) As recommended by other reviewers I soaked my banana slices in pineappIe juice and prepared cheesecake pudding (excellent with the choco cake) before mixing it with the whipped cream (I basically just moistened it with heavy whipping cream and almond breeze milk b/c it's all that I had on hand.) 3.) I cubed the cake instead of slicing. This made layering a little bit easier for me. It was enormously well-received and furthermore is a great base for experimentation.",

I mixed the (vanilla) pudding with 1 cup of milk before blending with sour cream and whipped topping. The texture was very creamy but not runny -- perfect. I also soaked the bananas in the pineapple juice as recommended and squirted a little lemon juice into the juice for extra protection against browning. Used \"store-bought\" angel cake.

However there is one caveat; be careful when you fold the pudding and sour cream into the whipped topping. Do not mix it excessively because it will get too liquidy and will drip on the sides. This happened to me the first time I made it and it ruined the beautifully layered look. So I immediately ran back to the store and made it again. I put the whipped topping/pudding mix into the frfeezer to chill for a few minutes so it wouldn' drip this time. It was well worth it though. For those of you who made it for a party: how did you manage for the whipped topping to not melt in the sides?",

The pudding mixture was very dry and difficult to spread over the cake pieces. Next time I will definitely do one of two things. 1.)I may prepare the pudding according to package directions before combing it with the cool whip and sour cream. Or 2.) I may drain the pineapple juice in with the dry pudding cool whip and sour cream. Another thing I would try is slicing your strawberried up beforehand then sprinkle with sugar or Splenda and allow them to juice up. The layers didn't meld together and was quite disappointing. This recipe has a great base....just needs to be tweeked a bit.",
