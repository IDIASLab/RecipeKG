In the summer we do a lot a \"cold noodle salad\" dishes - too warm to eat anything otherwise and when I stumbled upon this recipe I couldn't wait to try it! A twist between a noodle salad and a lettuce salad! You can use a variety of \"seasoning\" for the chicken (lemon pepper old bay etc..) and still be amazing. In addition to the cheese I shredded some carrots diced some celery and sprinkled parmesan overall. Also nice is that each individual can choose their dressing: French Ranch Cesar Raspberry Vingerette etc... To top it off is that is light but filling meal - perfect for summer evenings! Thanks for the keeper!",

I pan fried the chicken with steak seasoning instead of grilling added cubed cheddar and pepper jack cheeses instead of mozzarella. I also added 1/3 cup light mayo mixed with 1/3 cup Italian dressing and poured over all. It makes plenty for leftovers (only two of us) and I add the shredded lettuce right before serving so the leftover lettuce doesn't get soggy. Thanks for the great tip of adding steak seasoning on chicken! Will make this again and again!",
