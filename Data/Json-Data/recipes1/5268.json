                "reviewBody": "I was excited to find a Bourbon Chicken recipe with simple ingredients, as well as good reviews overall. On my second trial of this dish, I did, however, make some changes I believe for the better. \nFirst, used boneless skinless thighs (a bag of frozen chicken thighs, like Tyson). I doubled the marinade with the mesurements as writen, but then added about 3 tablespoons of oil (peanut), and topped off the brown sugar to 1 1/2 cup total. I also threw a few dashes of crushed red pepper, just for some contrast.\nAlot of reviewers said that the liquor taste was very strong, well I have a tip to try next time; you can subsitute Vanilla Extract(the cheap kind works best) for the bourbon. I personaly don't care for he taste of liquor, also this is what they use in the Mall. Tenderize and marinade in the fridge overnight in a gallon ziplock bag.\nAs far as the cooking, I used the same time & temp, but covered the pan with foil until the last 15 or 20 minutes. This gave the chicken a great color and taste. The oil also helped with the browning. Serve the remaining sauce from the bottom of the pan with the chicken over rice or mashed potatoes. \nI hope these tips will inspire you to make this dish your own too.",

I read a lot of the reviews before I made it and decided on several changes.  \r\nI chunked the chicken before placing in the marinade.  I also marinaded for about six hours rather than overnight.  \r\nBecause I wasn't sure how it would turn out I only bought an airplane size bottle of bourbon.  Turns out that is about a 1/4 cup.  I didn't think the alcohol taste was too strong.  I also added an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I didn't have dried onion or garlic powder on hand so I used fresh grated onion and a clove of chopped garlic.  \r\nI decided to stir-fry the meat and it worked out wonderfully, however be careful not to over cook the chicken.  I also boiled the sauce to reduce it.  I let it cook for about 15 minutes at a hard boil and I still thought it was too runny.  Next time I won't cook down all the sauce, it made a lot.\r\nI served the chicken with white rice and steamed veggies.  It turned out sweet and had a taste similar to Hawaiian style Teryaki.  Since I have never had Bourbon Chicken from the mall I can't really compair.  My husband who isn't a fan of Asian food and my one year old daughter both really liked the chicken.  I will make this again.",

I cut into thin strips and used fresh grated ginger, and 2 cloves crushed garlic.  Omitted the powders.  sauteed a large onion and added the meat and marinade.  Thickened with a little cornstarch. Served over basmati rice seasoned with saffron and peas.  This has a wonderful flavor.  I was leary of the amt. of brown sugar but although it is sweeter, it is not sickening.  This tastes sort of like General Tsao's but just has a unique flavor all its own due to the bourbon.  Now I know what to do with the big bottle of bourbon I bought by mistake.  Thanks for this super easy recipe packed with flavor.",
