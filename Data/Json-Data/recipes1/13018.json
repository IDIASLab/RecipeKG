I used walnuts instead of pecans.  I didn't use the blender for the eggs, just a whisk.  I almost didn't make the caramel sauce to spoon over it, but I'm glad I did.  I spooned the leftover sauce onto the leftover french toast before putting it in the fridge.  I love baked french toast dishes, and I will make this one again!",

The amts required tasted off to me esspecially with the combination of the caramel...and cinnamon is typically a favorite spice! I took other reviewer's advice by using only 1 layer of caramel (the bottom layer)b/c when you serve you can flip it over so that the caramel is on top. Also I only used 1 layer of bread which was thick-cut french bread slices. Finally I only used 3/4 of the egg/milk/spices mixture...as I poured overall I suddenly had an image of a previous baked french toast failure (from this site) which resulted in way too soggy bread. Glad I did (but sorry to waste the remaining 1/4-1/3 amt of mix)b/c the toast turned out very good. Only a few spots were a little mushy but overall most had cooked to the proper texture. Served with sausage and hashbrowns...what a meal! I would make this again reducing the egg/milk a little (so not to waste) and the spices to 1/2 tsp. Thanks Stefanie!",

It is an easy low mess way to feed a group.\nI will share all my modifications with you....\nI have made it in the morning without the overnight sit and baked it right away both ways turned out fine. I tear the bread into bits and have used all kinds of bread, from white to wheat to cinnamon and even hamburger buns when I was low on bread.\nI combine the carmel sauce and pour it all on the bottom for lots of goey sauce when dishing.  I also reduce the milk to 1cup and use 8 eggs to prevent it from being soggy. I don't put in the nutmeg and choose to sprinkle the cinnamon directly onto of the bread.  It has been perfect every time!!",
