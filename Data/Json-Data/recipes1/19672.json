Other than not being familiar with grated tomatoes, which I found described on the internet, the recipe was easy to follow.  I used crushed tomatoes anyway and strained them.  Seemed to work fine.  Great flavor, dramatic presentation.  I will use this one again.  Thanks",

I made it on Christmas Eve so I added a grilled lobster prawns and blue crabs but I wouldn't do that unless it's a special occasion. There was a definite learning curve to making this dish. Mine took more chicken stock than the recipe called for I'm not sure how much more because I just kept adding it until my rice was the right texture. Also I started this dish on one stove burner but quickly noticed I needed to use two of them. I also had to keep rotating the pan to ensure the pot was cooking evenly. We have a small wood fire in our backyard and I think I would like to try cooking this over that next time. The best part of this dish is the rice! The rice has a gorgeous brown crust that forms and it is flavored beautifully with the onions garlic and chorizo. I am really looking forward to making this again! Thanks Maria for a great recipe!",
