I wanted the tiramisu to be edible for all my dinner guests, including a pregnant woman. I cut the angel food cake into strips to mock ladyfingers, then beat the cream, marscapone, vanilla and sugar until fluffy. I added a fourth cup of strongly brewed decaf coffee to the marscapone mixture, and whipped it again. I then alternated layers of angelfood fingers, the marscapone mixture, and cinnamon sprinklings, topping it off with the last of the marscapone mix and cinnamon. I chilled for about an hour. This was a huge hit and I will definitely make it again!",
