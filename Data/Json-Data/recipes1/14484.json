The only thing I changed was to par boil the potatoes before hand (after reading other reviews that the potatoes were not cooked completely thru). Ended up marinating for about 18 hours as we had a grandbaby born the day in which these were intended.  I Think because they were partially cooked before marinated helped to ensure they soaked up the flavor.  Super Yummy!!!  Took some to the hospital for my daughter and she really liked!!  By the way, beautiful baby boy!!!!",

Followed the spices exactly but did not have time to marinate just covered with foil and baked 1-1/4 hours covered and another 15 minutes uncovered, turned out great and they were even tastier as left overs.

The trick to making these is to cook them long and slow (especially if you don't have time to marinate). Otherwise yes they don't have enough time to absorb the flavours. I suggest 2 hours on 350 and then turn down to 300 (or even lower depending on your oven) for another half hour taking the lid off for the last 30 minutes. They come out browned and full of flavour! (Greek potatoes are intended to be a little mushy).",
