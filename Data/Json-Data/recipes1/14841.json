These are the changes I made: 1) Cut down serving size for 2 for fish/veggies & serving for 4 for the spices (as another rater did) 2) used dry parsley since I didn't have fresh ones on hand 3) used 1 cup mixed black & green olives sliced 4) added 1 sliced serrano pepper to add more spice (we love spicy) 5) added 1/2 cup raisins to the dish. I also cooked the fish for 40 mins as the recipe said, but I think it would have been done in 30 mins (it started to break apart at 40 mins). \nI served the fish with the easy curry coucous (recipe found on this site) without the raisins in that recipe...the dishes combined was a GREAT hit!
