Since I was doing this without a bread machine I started with water, sugar, and yeast until it got foamy.  Then I added warm milk, butter, and the flour.  I stuck mostly to the recipe with a few modifications since I didn't have all of the ingredients.  I used 1/2 cup warm water and 1/2 cup warm milk.  And instead of using dried onion and garlic I sauteed fresh onion and 1 large clove of garlic.  (It came out to be 1/4 cup of cooked onions.)  I added the cooked onions and garlic along with the cheese after the first rise (which took about 45 minutes).  After punching it down I let it rise until it had doubled (about an hour) then I put it in the oven at 350 for around 25 minutes until the top was golden brown.  It came out delicious, the onions didn't make the bread watery and they weren't crunchy like other reviewers commented.  I think sauteeing them fixes this problem.  I made the loaf into a giant sandwich which we ate on our roadtrip.  Everyone couldn't get enough of it.",
