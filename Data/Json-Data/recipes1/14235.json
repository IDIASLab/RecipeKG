I put at least a cup of sunflower seeds (toasted it makes a big difference) and sometimes other nuts. I've played around with the oil-applesauce ratio and honestly never notice much of a distance I also add about 1/2 c of peanut butter. I never put more then 1/2 c brown sugar. And add cinnamon because cinnamon is always good.",
