It's a ground beef casserole that combines egg noodles, some sherry, and cheese in a tomato sauce base. To reduce the fat content, you may use reduced fat cheese, cut green beans, and 93% lean meat. Also, you may adjust the amount of sherry to taste.",

The sherry gives it a very rich flavor and the soup makes it luscious and creamy. My husband thinks it tastes like lasagna. Some reviewers have mentioned that baking is unneccesary, I dissagree. The baking melds the flavors together and give the noodles a lovely soft texture,(be sure to cook al dente to start). It is all so worth the effort!",

After reading the reviews, I only used 1/8 cup sherry and baked it for 15 minutes, just to let the Parmesan cheese melt on top.  I used shredded parmesan instead of grated.  The sherry definitely gave it a unique flavor that I enjoyed, but don't think I would have wanted more in the sauce.  I also used a mexican blend cheese because I didn't have the cheddar cheese. Next time I might try using at least 1 can of tomato sauce to replace one of the cans of soup.",
