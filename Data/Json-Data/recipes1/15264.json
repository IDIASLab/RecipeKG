I would cut the butter in half and add more cream cheese. I believe the filling would benefit from lemon flavoring and grated lemon peel. I did have to use twice the amount of cornstarch...luckily I followed my hunches as the filling would have been too runny otherwise. The cake itself was exceptional...I only made two layers instead of three and they were ready in exactly 20 minutes. Overall I would reduce the amount of sugar all around as it seemed far too sweet for my taste. Grating the coconut by hand was a chore....but oh so worth it! This cake looked beautiful when it was presented and people were literally gushing....A true \"suzy homemaker moment\"!",

I would strongly suggest however that you minimize the amount of butter for the filling. All of the butter gave the filling a strong taste of just that; BUTTER and it overpowered the taste of coconut. Instead use a tablespoon of butter to give the filling a stronger taste of coconut. I ended up making it twice and I want to save everyone else from wasting products. Other than that I made this cake dished it out to the neighborhood and received rave reviews. I will be making a lot more of this cake as I am a huge coconut fan.",
