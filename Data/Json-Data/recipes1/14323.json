I used red yellow and orange bell peppers sliced red onion for color and NO tomato didn t have it but wouldn t have used it anyway. I was fairly satisfied with the look of the salad but thought it needed some punch. A handful of ripe black olives took care of that. As for the dressing I merely shook on some salt pepper oregano and basil (didn t have marjoram and never have). I skipped the sugar - I don t care for it in my salad dressings. I drizzled on the vinegar (always vinegar first) and then the olive oil to my liking. (My preference is a ratio of 3:1 of olive oil to vinegar) This salad satisfied both my goals of cleaning up the odds and ends in my vegetable crisper lickety-split as well as being a nutritious fresh and colorful addition to our dinner tonight. I particularly like the simple herb vinaigrette and the submitter s directions to THINLY SLICE the vegetables (as opposed to chopping them all up as others have done) it gave the salad a beautiful appearance with each ingredient seeming to take center stage. I can t think of too many entrees that this salad wouldn t complement nicely.",

This was perfect with chianti and Artichoke and Spinach Lasagna, also from this site.",
