It wasn't hot at all but did have a nice flavor. I was thinking that if I made it again I'd add a little less sugar and have it on hot dogs. I would also probably pulse it in a food processor to cut it a little finer than I did. This made a little over a pint for me. I used four Roma tomatoes that I seeded. It doesn't say to do that in the recipe but I just figured you should.",
