There is no way one fourth cup of flour will thicken 6 cups of liquid. The normal proportion is 2 Tablespoons flour, or 1 Tablespoon cornstarch, per cup of liquid. So, I used 6 tablespoons of cornstarch and I was pleased with the result. Instead of putting the cornstarch in the one cup of water, I used one cup of cold broth. I did not want to water down the flavor of the gravy. I was very happy to have a tasty gravy with no fat. You may also want to adjust the salt. If you are using bouillon, or canned broth, you probably do not need to add any salt. I would recommend making this without salt and adding later if you need it. ",

The only change I made was that I always use the water that I've boiled the potatoes in, instead of regular old tap water.  I think it just gives the gravy a better taste plus with the potatoes having been in the water, it might even help with the thickening.  Whether or not, this is a keeper.  \n\nThanks for sharing!",

You can put the turkey drippings in the fridge over night and scrape of the top fat in the morning or drop some ice cubes in the drippings and it will bring the fat to the top. I didn t have a full 6 cups worth so I used turkey drippings and canned chicken broth. I also added 2 cups of egg noodles a couple diced boiled eggs and a can of cream of chicken. This really makes the gravy something special! Don t worry if you don t have the poultry or celery seasoning just season to your taste. This is a TERRIFIC base recipe that can be adapted many ways!",
