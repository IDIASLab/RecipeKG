Finally I had to thicken up my milk more with roux (mixture of melted butter and flour) before I added it to the tomatoes but my tomatoes were very watery.

I like my tomato soup thick and a little chunky so I used 4 cans of diced and peeled tomatoes. When heating them I added a Tbsp butter lots of salt/pepper and tsp sugar. Once it was hot and lost most of its liquid I blended half the tomatoes and added a small can of tomato paste when that was smooth I barely blended the rest of the tomatoes in. I did not have marjoram and could not find the basil in my spice drawer so I used an Italian mix that had the three spices a long with garlic... It was discusting! Since then I dont add the spices and it is great. Thanks for this EASY recipe that is flexible to meet anyone's taste!!!",

I used 1% milk FRESH HERBS (SOOOO TASTY!!!!) and added one can of tomato paste. It came out amazing! The kids even loved it! They put fishy crackers in theirs and us adults had it with Feta cheese (per another reviewer) and it was sooooo good. I recommend using fresh herbs and letting it simmer for a while. It smells amazing. I made mine the night before and then heated it back up on the stove - even BETTER!",
