Since I enjoy the simple freshness of grilled scallops or even scallops sauted in garlic and butter I found the various flavors unsatisfying. In fact my husband also did not like the tastes and we ended up throwing out the appetizer. This is unfortunate since it is easy to make and would be a beautiful appetizer.",
