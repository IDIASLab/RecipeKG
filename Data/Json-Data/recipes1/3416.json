I only drained about half the water from the veggies- just depends on how you like the consistency of your soup. I also added diced chicken which I browned with lots of minced garlic prior to adding. Due to my added ingredients I added an additional cup of milk and a cup of half and half. We are big cheese lovers so I used a whole brick of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I seasoned the soup with pepper garlic salt and bay leaf. It was absolutely delicious! One of our new family favorites.",

However I stuck to recipe (worried it was going to be bland and tasteless) and I'm so glad I did. This is REALLY good AND really quick to throw together (my school's on a two hour delay this morning so I made it as our French toast cooked...it's that easy). I also like that it uses staple ingredients (if I add canned creamed corn to the grocery list) so it can be a great lastminutedidntplandinnernowwhatdoimake meal. It's not the healthiest soup in the world but at least we're getting some veggies. THANKS for a new soup recipe that will get used again at the LTH house! Random notes: I left out the celery (because it's gross) and used a red onion because it's the only onion I had and the recipe didn't specify type (I'll use yellow in the future though the red added nice color). I also added some extra leftover frozen corn because my mixed veggie bag was 12 oz. There are no cook temps listed so I went w/medium high for the roux.",
