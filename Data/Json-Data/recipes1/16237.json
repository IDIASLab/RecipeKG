Even our 2.5 year old enjoyed the chicken. We will be making this again.",

I was hesitant because I don't usually like fennel but followed the recipe exactly and am glad I did. I suggest making more almond/orange zest coating - I ran out after the third breast (although in fairness they were thick breasts). My almond coating burned to the pan so next time I'll try another reviewer's suggestion and use parchment paper. I'm not sure if it made a difference but I marinated the chicken in OJ while I prepared the coating.",
