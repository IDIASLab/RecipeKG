Instead of walnuts I used Skor toffee bits and added a simple glaze to the top when still warm. We couldn't keep our hands off of them. Whoever made these before and said they were a globby mess probably didn't bake them long enough or they prefer the hard rolls. These are definitely the gooiest! Wonderful!!",
