It only needs to be baked about an hour if you use a typical dark ring pan. Perfect for serving for dessert or teatime...just delicious.

Since the summer of '05 I have made this recipe many times with wolderful results.  Never changing the cake ingredients, I've used various cake pans and made cupcakes too.  Like so many others using a tube pan, I found my cakes are done before the 80 minutes so keep an eye on yours.  I have used Geri's glaze, cream cheese icing suggested by others and left it plain. No matter how I have served it family and friends have loved it.  I have learned to take a copy of the recipe when I take this cake to gatherings.  The pineapple is a terrific addition Geri. Uniced cupcakes/muffins served with Sunday brunch are my personal favorite. The muffins freeze well too.",

I also used the remaining pineapple juice from the can with some confectioner's sugar and drizzled it over the warm cake. Will definately make again but will coat the walnuts in flour as mine all sunk to the bottom and peel the zucchini as the green flecks are a bit off putting. Thank you!",

Baked it in a 10\" Bundt pan for 60 minutes...let it stand in the pan for 10 minutes before turning it out...popped out perfectly!  (That part always makes me nervous.)  Glazed it with a fairly thick glaze consisting of 2 tablespoons cream cheese, 3/4 cup powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon pineapple juice, and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  It was so pretty I submitted a picture, which is now under review, so we'll see if it ever shows up.  :)  Thanks for a delicious way to use zucchini!",

That said I've made this cake twice and while the flavor is delicious they both deflated in the oven stuck to the pan and fell completely apart by the time I got them out. I believe the pineapple even drained and patted dry is releasing too much liquid and sugar during baking and it's acting like a sticky adhesive. Some more treatment needs to be done to the pineapple or you need to leave it out. Again great flavor but I don't want to be using a spoon to scoop out the other half of the cake from the pan.",
