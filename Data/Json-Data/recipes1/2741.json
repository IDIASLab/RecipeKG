The little guys puffed up nicely and looked fabulous but the taste was definitely lacking spice -- 7 cups of flour plus only 4 teaspoons of spice just wasn't enough. Next time I'll use 2 teaspoons each of cloves cinnamon and allspice 3 teaspoons of ginger and I'll add about a teaspoon of nutmeg. I also found the dough extremely difficult to work with chilled or not. It did become slightly easier to work with once I added a teaspoon or two of water and kneaded the dough for a while. I may leave out some of the flour to make it easier to work with next time instead of adding extra water. Definitely not my favourite tasting cookie but beautiful for hanging on the tree.",
