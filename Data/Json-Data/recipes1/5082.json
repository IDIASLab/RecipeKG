I prepare the bread by putting all ingredients in the breadmaker and set it to manual. When finished let it rise for an hour then put in a loaf pan and bake at 350 for 35 mins. This makes a nice loaf without it looking like it came out of a breadmaker. I also found out the hard way that you can buy flaxseed oil at Wal-Mart for alot cheaper than in a helthfood store.",

I didn't have flaxseed oil or liquid lecithin so I substituted safflower oil and granulated lecithin. Besides flaxseed oil and liquid lecithin are a bit on the pricy side. I also experimented with agave nectar in place of the honey. It worked well. Whey powder is not very expensive and can be purchased in bulk from most health food stores including Whole Foods/Wild Oats and the Vitamin Cottage. Milled flaxseed is available in the health food sections of most supermarkets nowadays. My breadmaker calls for the water temperature to be 85 degrees F. Finally table salt works just as well as sea salt plus it's readily available in iodized form which is a good way to get this valuable micronutrient. This one's a keeper! Thanks!",
