I was skeptical about mixing milk directly with vinegar in the dressing because I thought the milk would curdle so I combined all the dressing ingredients except the milk stirred it well then added the milk. The dressing tasted just like what I've had at good Thai restaurants!!! I made one addition to the noodle mixture: fresh cilantro. The results were so fresh and yummy! I'm glad the recipe made a lot of noodle salad because I'm looking forward to having it for lunch tomorrow.",
