I should mention that I turned oven oven before I started and by the time I had these whipped up and two cookie sheets prepared, my oven was just finishing the preheating...now that is quick.  Ease of prep and ingredients, as well as versatility make this a great recipe for busy moms....children could make these.  I didn't add the extra water..used a 'golden butter recipe' mix, added butterscotch and white choc. morsels.  The first batch just came out and it is a wonderful tasting combo.  Good to read reviews to find out they dry out quickly...the old slice of bread always does the trick.  Lightly sprayed cookie sheets and would recommend not letting these sit too long before removal or they would stick.",

I added an extra egg since it seemed dry and I've read that that'd be good to add an egg for fluff and/or chewieness, and I used 1 1/3 cups white chocolate chips and 1/4 cup chopped amlonds.  Awesome!  I did not make the mistake of overbaking as I usually do, and removed at exactly 10 minutes.  I will sooooooooooooooooo make these again!  Thanks!!",

If making the tsp. size cookie there would be only 1 cranberry in each not a bad idea for presentation. Excellent recipe easy to adapt to anything!",
