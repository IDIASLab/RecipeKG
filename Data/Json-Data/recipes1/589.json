THESE ARE FABULOUS and can be made as-is, with the exception of doubling the frosting recipe (we like ours with a lot of frosting!)\n\nMy great grandmother was the Orange Cookie Queen and used to guard her recipe like a government secret... no one else's cookies ever turned out like Great's! Great passed away at the age of 97 in 1992 and never fully revealed her recipe to any of us. I tried this recipe a few years ago and OMG, I thought they were Great's cookies reincarnated... only MUCH easier to make because the recipe has been updated with modern conveniences like sour cream (instead of souring your own) and frozen orange juice concentrate (instead of squeezing your own and working like mad to balance the liquid-dry ingredient ratio.) Beth, my family LOVES this recipe and whenever I make these cookies, the \"remember when\" stories start flying. Thank you for such a delicious, easy-to-make recipe that brings a warm, nostalgic feeling to my heart... and a yummy satisfaction to my tummy!",
