This gave it a flavor absolutely identical to Cracker Jacks (I also used Spanish peanuts rather than dry roasted).  I used a large roasting pan and a jelly roll pan, placing the jelly roll pan on the bottom rack in the oven and the roasting pan on the rack just above it.  When you first pour the caramel over your corn, you'll think you'll never get it mixed up well....BUT...after the first 15 mins in the oven, it becomes thinner so that you can easily stir to combine.  After that, it progressively gets thicker and totally adheres to the popcorn.  Believe it or not, clean-up was a snap (I was pleasantly surprised!).  Just butter your pan very well and then rinse with hot water as soon as you finish.  I would definitely suggest using a good quality popcorn (rather than the cheaper type) so that you get nice fluffy, puffy pieces.  I used Orville's microwave butter popcorn, and it took about 2-1/2 bags to make 7 qts.  Thank you again...my entire family loves this recipe! :)",

Baked at 200 for 40-45 minutes stirring every 10-15 min.\n2. Used butter instead of margarine.\n3. Used a large roasting pan. Much easier for stirring.\n4. I used a whisk for stirring but when adding the baking soda, I switched to a large spatula. That way you are able to get all the caramel out of the pan.\n5. I made the caramel first then popped the popcorn. When the popcorn is hot it's easier to stir the caramel mixture into it. Be sure to remove any unpopped kernels.\n6. Before you add the caramel sauce, drop 1 tbsp. of it on wax paper. Wait for it to cool down and you have a piece of homemade caramel just as a treat for you! Cuz you're worth it!\nPros: Best I've ever tried\nCons: Should have made two batches. One for me and one for the rest of the family.\nAnother con was waiting for it to cool down. I just couldn't stop picking at it.\nQuality control is important you know.\nThis will be a new gift at Christmas time. And it's cheaper than buying it.\nThank you so much for sharing.",

I lined one of the pans with foil, but ran out when I went to line the other pan.  On the unlined pan, the carmel drippings came off and mixed very well with the popcorn while I stirred it and also when I removed it from the pan.

                "reviewBody": "I feel so badly reviewing this recipe with 3 stars!  Mine tasted kind of burnt.  I will definately try it again and cut down the cooking significantly.  My oven only goes down to 300 so I cut down the cooking time to only 25 minutes and stirred it often...still tasted burned.  I would NOT use margarine either...ICK!  I will for sure try it again though.  Thanks!\n\nUpdate-I made this again with perfection.  I'll share my tips to perfect caramel corn!  It is a 10-star with my changes.  Maybe the first recipe was fine, but it just didn't work for me.  I used 2 bags of microwave popcorn (it was buttered) and picked out the popped corn.  I made the caramel exactly like the recipe except using real butter.  I greased two large baking sheets and set those aside.  I used a large paper grocery bag, sprayed the inside with Pam and dumped the popcorn in.  Then when the caramel was done i poured it into the bag, stirred and then shook the bag.  I dumped the coated corn out onto the prepared sheets.  The corn was totally covered!  I cooked it at 300 for about 19 minutes stirring every 5 minutes.  I used a large spatual to stir the corn as to get all the caramel off the bottom of the pan.  I think followed the directions for cooling the corn.  Perfection!!!!  I hope my tips help.",
