I didn't top it off with tortillas, only the cheese, and didn't realize it was supposed to be covered.  So, I baked it, uncovered, for 40 minutes and let it sit for 5 minutes, and I think it turned out pretty good! I think the fact that it turned out good and not soupy like others have mentioned, is because I didn't cover it in the first place! LOL.  I like the addition of the cream of chicken soup/sour cream base.  I also sauteed fresh chicken strips with a little olive oil, cumin, and chili powder since the recipe doesn't exactly say what to do with the chicken. I think I'll be making this again.",

This was a great \"comfort\" food recipe!",

I have also made it by putting a portion of the diced chicken/sour cream/green onioins/soup green chilies/cheese mixture into the center of 8-10 flour tortillas rolling them up and placing them in a Pam-sprayed blong pyrex casserole dish. I put the remaing mixture over the top and cover it all with more cheese. Bake as directed (uncovered) and serve with the salsa as your garnish. This way each person knows where the servings are divided and has his/her own enchilada. My family loves these! We also serve them with homemade guacamole. (2-3 fresh ripe avacados mashed; 1-2 T. lemon juice; 1 small chopped onion; 1 t. salt and 1 dollop sour cream. Mix until smooth and serve with tortilla chips.) YUMMY!",
