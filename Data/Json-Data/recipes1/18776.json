Because others commented that it was too soft or runny, I did use two pkgs unflavored gelatin in 2/3 cup water, brought to a boil in the microwave and then slowly added to the cream cheese and sugar mixture with the electric mixer running. It turned out great and was a big hit for our family gathering. I definitely recommend and will be making this flavor or another version again.",
