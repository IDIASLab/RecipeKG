I've found that in most recipes, you can decrease the sugar by 1/3 (i.e., 3 tablespoons would now be 2 tablespoons), the salt by 2/3 (1 tablespoon would be 1 teaspoon), and replace the shortening with vegetable oil. Each rising time will be 10-15 minutes shorter.",

I use the dough hook to do the kneading. It took about 7 minutes until it \"felt right.\" Let the machine do the work! Ann",

I used the active dry yeast but I activated it first. I mixed one serving of yeast (1 packet or 2.25 tsp) with 1/4 C. of warm water. Then added one tsp. sugar and waited about 5 minutes or until it foamed. Then I mixed it with the other dry ingredients. Finally I added the water. I used my kitchenaid mixer to do the kneading - about 7-9 minutes. Works great. I like the bread and was happy to find a low sodium recipe that tastes great.",
