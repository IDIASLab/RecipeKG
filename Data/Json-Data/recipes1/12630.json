Also added some fresh chopped parsley and 1 more clove of garlic, as I love garlic flavor.  This had a nice fresh taste.  The only thing I would do differently next time would be to use much less EVOO..maybe 1 tbsp. is all that is needed.  I found the extra was just floating around on top but it didn't taste 'greasy' though.  I would also double the recipe.  After I let it cook down to the consistency that I like (on the thicker side) it was enough for 3 people which was fine.  Very nice.  thanks for the quick and easy recipe.  It is amazing how flavorful this was with such few ingredients.  I used a sangria(was all I had) and the extra sweetness I think helped so it was not tart at all.",

Nevertheless, the flavor enhancement of the white wine was spectacular, just enough zing to change this from everyday marinara sauce to something special. We really enjoyed it. I only used two tablespoons of olive oil, to reduce the fat a bit and also added a small can of tomato paste (to thicken the sauce) and a pound of ground turkey. My wife and son both thought it was excellent and I will definitely repeat this one over and over again.",
