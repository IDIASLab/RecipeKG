I realize it a little difficult to work with but so worth it.  What I do is to cut the wheel into quarters and the just pinch small pieces of cheese with your fingers and drop it onto the salad.  That way your not getting any of the rind, which can be tough or bitter, and you are not trying to battle with a knife & soft cheese.  Whew, I feel better now.  This is definitely a five star.  I used Sesame Ginger dressing (newmans) and it paired great with the ingredients.  Thanks for the post!",

I'm not sure I like the gooey-ness of the Brie on the salad. The rest of the salad was a sure hit with the family. It was light not over powering and just very enjoyable. I used Blasamic Vinegrette Spritzer dressing. I made the salad a second time later in the week and with the few changes I made it goes to the head of my recipe bos. I used fresh Mozzarella cheese slices and toasted pecans and macadamian nuts. I especially like the lightness of the dressing. This will show up at our table often and I would have no problem at all serving it to guests. I highly recommend this salad.",

Next time I will probably use a little less vinegar since my greens were sort of swimming in it. While toasting the walnuts I added a few tsps of sugar and really enjoyed the sweet taste with the tang of the vinegar and tartness of the apples. Also added a few more walnuts than the recipe called for and didn't use all of the apples but that is just personal taste. For sure a salad that I would serve to guests.",

I chose the All Recipes' sweet & tangy Honey Balsamic Vinaigrette (adding only 4 extra tsp. of oil to that). Because the dressing asked for was double the needed quantity I can only give this salad 3 stars as written; a small puddle of dressing remained even after halving it. I sliced thinly only 1 Gala apple cutting the slices in thirds for ease of eating; proportionately that was enough for the 5 c. baby lettuces used. The quantities of Brie (1/2 c.) & toasted walnuts (1/3 c.) remained the same as recipe called for; these provided a nice taste & texture contrast in the salad.",
