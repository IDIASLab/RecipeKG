                "reviewBody": "8.21.20  I followed this recipe to the letter, and was very disappointed with how it turned out.  So many things I would question WHY.  Why do you need both all purpose and self-rising flour, rather than just all purpose and some baking powder?  I\u2019m not a really experienced baker, so just asking because I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019ve made a lot of different muffin recipes, and this is the first time I\u2019ve ever baked at 400\u00baF.  At 9 minutes, I headed back to the kitchen because something smelled like it was burning. Sure enough, it was the mini muffins, and if they\u2019d been in the oven even for one additional minute, they would have gone into the trash.  Why 400\u00baF?  They probably should have come out at 6-7 minutes, most of them are burned on the outside.  Most importantly, these muffins had very little flavor.  I could not taste even a hint of banana.  They were dry and tough, most likely from cooking too long at such a high temp.  A second banana certainly would have helped with the lack of moisture.  When I put the muffin tin into the oven, I looked around, and I had bowls everywhere.  Honestly, this recipe has 19 ingredients, and too many steps.  IMO muffins should be easy to make, and there are plenty on this site that are.  I know I\u2019m the first reviewer, and I don\u2019t want to discourage others from trying this recipe, but this is one that I won\u2019t be making again.  T*Lee, sorry for the bad review, but reviews should be honest.",
