I love that you don't peel the peaches, it made it much easier to prepare and the skins added a lovely rosy color to the preserves.  Also, since they are diced instead of sliced, they seem to hold their shape a little better and not all float to the top of the jar. I read that in preserves, the liquid should be about the thickness of honey, and that is how it turned out for me, not too liquid at all, but also not too sticky to spread. We have given jars of these preserves as gifts and gotten rave reviews.",

I loved that there is no peeling, no lemon squeezing, and no skimming to do.  I think the secret to success is to be sure to bring the fruit and sugar mixture to a gentle boil that continues even when stirred, before adding the pectin.  If you add the pectin too soon, your preserves may end up runny.  Also, remember that this is a preserve recipe.  Preserves don't set up like jelly.  They should be about the consistency of honey.  That's exactly what I got, and the flavor is wonderful!  Definitely a keeper!",
