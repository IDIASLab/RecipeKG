So I put the shrimp shells in the chicken stock and added one more cup of chicken stock and one cup of white wine then reduced it back down to the amount called-for in the recipe (then removed the shells of course!) I also cooked the roux to a golden brown before proceeding with the rest of the recipe. The recipe does not call for \"trinity\" (onions celery and green pepper) and no cajun seasoning - which I found interesting. So I served this recipe with a bottle of papaya hot sauce for people to pass around.",
