I cut the parsley in half used 3/4 cup of mayo instead of a full cup (and used a low-fat version) and added 1/3 cup shredded swiss cheese to the mixture. It's not that I felt there would be too much mayo -- it's just that I wanted to add the swiss and knowing it would melt I had to cut back on something to reduce the grease and not overpowering the seafood completely. Thank you for an inspiring idea!",

I used canned crab Geisha brand and I did reduce the mayo to 3/4 cup and used a light mayo. I also only used one stalk of celery since I don't normally like it cooked but it did keep its crispness so I was happy. I think next time I will try adding some cheese on top instead of the bread crumbs. One other thing I did was I used homemade Garlic croutons and ground them up to make bread crumbs. I will be making this again for sure.",
