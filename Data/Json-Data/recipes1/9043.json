Something definitely missing to make the pudding creamy and not separate. 2 1/2 c of milk is what I'd use for 1 1/2 c cooked rice on the stovetop. Since this was only 1c cooked rice the milk ratio is probably too high. I also wondered about the bake temp of 400 seems quite high (vs. 375 or even 350).
