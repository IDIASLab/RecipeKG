The caramel went to a hard crack stage before ever turning golden (I think this would be solved by 'browning' the sugar before adding the water). The only one who liked the sticky sweet flavor was my 2 yr old. I tried this recipe because I had a bunch of yolks left over after making an angel food cake. Next time I'll just make a lot of pudding. Thanks for the tip about using a dish towel in a water bath though.",

So I tried this recipe I only had brown sugar on hand which is white sugar and molasses anyway. I also had to double the recipe; my daughter could not wait to eat it so I did not get to invert it or let it cool long. I just took the ice-cream scoop and put it in a bowl for her and scoop out some of the caramel syrup onto the top. She loved it. I tasted it and could not believe that I've  just done that with egg yolks. It was firm and smooth at the same time. Whipped topping would also be a nice touch. It was not too sweet either ;~)",
