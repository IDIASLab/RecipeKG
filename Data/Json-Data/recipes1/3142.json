The flavors melded perfectly, with nothing overpowering anything else.  Next time I make it I might add a bit more poblano, or use something hotter like serrano or jalapeno.  I don't think that many people here in NM would think this tastes like the southwest since it is quite mild.  It would be a great dish for a dinner party, or even a brunch.  One could make the mixture, refrigerate it and bake it later in the day.  Thanks Christine for a wonderful elegant dish!",
