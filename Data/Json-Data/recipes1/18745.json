I also spray the tacos with a little oil and bake them on a cooking sheet- causing them to turn out crispy and slightly brown.  I love the resulting crunch and that they can be eaten by hand once they've cooled a little.  I am single and find it really convenient to make the mixture and bake one taco at a time during the week.",
