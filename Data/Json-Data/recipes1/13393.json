I was needing something lower in carbs and with my swaps it came in nice and low. Once the chocolate was melted I added the cream and had a very hard time incorporating the chocolate into it. Once the cream was hot I put it in a bowl and used a hand blender for a few seconds at a time until the chocolate and cream were thoroughly mixed. I'm not sure if heating the cream first and then adding the chocolate to it would help but my improvisation worked. I used two 10 oz ramekins and it was so rich that next time I'll do smaller portions. Plus there was so much extra meringue I piled it into another 10 oz ramekin and baked it along with the puddings. I did bake my meringue-topped puddings for at least another 10 minutes and it may have been a bit longer. Overall this was a great treat and I will make it again.",

So when making your pudding use 3 egg yolks and when doing the meringue use the 3 egg whites. I'm not sure if I'm the only one with the whole egg thing... But I was confused at first. But this recipe looks delicious! I cant wait to try it!:)Thank you for putting this recipe on this website!:)",
