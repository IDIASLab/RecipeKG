My wife and I both love Asian food and we love burgers, so one day I got inspired to whip up this recipe. They turned out amazing the first time; you just have to try these. They are so flavorful you can eat them without a bun. I would recommend putting some extra teriyaki sauce on them.",

This is special & would be a treat. My husband asked if there was liquid smoke in it nope. He couldn't believe either how much it tasted like good ribs. I didn't have apple cider so didn't use anything in its place just left out. I really don't see what it could've added because they were very moist & you have to put in the freezer for the 30 min to keep them firm. We didn't know if you'd use ketchup on these or what. I'd recommend just butter the bun & crisp them up. We did try a little BBQ sauce on a bite or two & it still tasted like a good rib with BBQ sauce then. I'm still having a hard time getting my head around how teriyaki sauce apple red pepper ginger & soy sauce onion & bread crumbs come out like they did for the flavor. Sorry can't say enough so good & juicy with lots of flavor.",

Added 1 TBSP minced garlic and teaspoon of all spice. I also substituted an apple chipotle sauce for the teriyaki as I was anxious to try the chipotle sauce. Just the aroma was tantalizing! I look forward to grilling these burgers this summer but this time they baked for 20-25 minutes on a broiler pan in a 400 degree oven turned at 15 minutes and broiled on high for an additional 2 mins on each side to brown the burgers slightly. Topped with slices of apple additional chipotle sauce and mozzarella for the last 2 minutes of broiling - though I would've preferred a sharp white cheddar in place of the mozzarella (but we had none on hand). I'm confident these would've been exceptional exactly as the recipe is written but they were also easy to adapt to what was on hand and DELICIOUS and so moist! (Served with side of chipotle sweet potato fries.) Thanks Norm for the great recipe!",

I used 1 pound of ground pork half a small Granny Smith apple and 1/4 of a green bell pepper. We like onion so I used 1/2 a small red onion. Some of the other reviewers mentioned that it was hard to make the mixture stick together so I used more bread crumbs and all the liquid the recipe called for. It still wouldn't stick together. I added more bread crumbs but I still couldn't form the mixture into patties. The only other thing I could think of was to add an egg. I did that and still couldn't make patties. So I put the mixture in a loaf pan and made a meatloaf out of it! I baked it at 350\u00ba for 45 minutes. It was just OK. It won't take the place of my usual meatloaf and I won't even try to make burgers from this recipe. It didn't have much flavor but part of the reason for that is that the recipe doesn't call for adding any salt.Even I thought it desperately needed salt and I don't usually add salt to anything.",
