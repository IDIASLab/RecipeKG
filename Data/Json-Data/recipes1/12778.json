I used raspberries in place of strawberries because I was lucky enough to happen upon them. Two college athletes and the rest of the group agreed it was excellent. One tip which was taught to me by my aunt many years ago when cooking vanilla pudding or custard as a filling: Cook it with a piece of lemon rind/zest. It offers a subtle dimension to the filling that is delightful and was effective here. Also I was low on sherry and substituted with Amaretto. No complaints!",

Next time I'll probably use a clear vanilla flavoring rather than vanilla extract.",
