I also ran my oats through the mini food processor for a finer consistancy. Baked at 350 my cookies were done at just about 9 minutes. I let them cool on the baking sheet for a minute or so to let them firm up before I pulled them off of the baking sheet just so that they wouldn't break apart. These look wonderful and taste even better. I loved that I didn't have to chill the dough it was ready to go right out of the mixer. Great little cookie recipe!",

They are delicious - the different textures create a pleasant tasting experience - they are chewy sweet crunchy crispy nutty and bake up to a beautiful golden color. I used a small cookie scoop and scooped the dough onto parchment lined baking pans. I baked for 10 minutes at 350 degrees allowed them to cool and then lifted them right off the paper. This is a keeper and next time I make them I may add a few dried cherries or cranberries and chocolate chips. This recipe has unlimited possibilities and I'm glad I found it.

Also I didn't have parchment paper but I wish I did because they are very hard to remove. I tried grease and aluminum foil but they both worked only so-so. I also omitted the nuts for my husband's sake and they were yummy. May try adding raisins next time. Very sweet flat chewy cookie. Enjoy!",

I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out with the shortening instead of butter but it works. The shortening and sugar do not really \"cream\" together. They blend into a grainy mixture. I mixed the rest of the ingredients with ease. These cookies came out of the 350 oven soft as described in the recipe. I left them on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes before moving to a cooling rack. Make sure to let them rest for a little because they will fall apart otherwise. Wow! These cookies are so chewy and have so many textures. A few people thought that they had toffee in them. They loved the name too! My boyfriend is a big Chocolate Chip fan but found these to be delicious. My co-workers enjoyed these immensely. A few people sought me out for more! I will make these again!",
