I had complete success using caned pumpkin instead of the cream of pumpkin soup (subbed it evenly). I also made a quick spaghetti sauce out of some tomato sauce and a few seasonings with help of this website. I only had a mixed cheese blend on hand and it worked wonderfully. I left it covered for the first 30 min then uncovered and let brown for the last 5. This is a great way to sneak in some veggies on your kids. It's not overly pumpkin-y just enough to know that it's there. My toddler ate this up so it'll be on hand for future use!",

Honestly I really can only see kids enjoying this \"lasagna\" because it is so bland in taste. 1 can of pumpkin and 1 jar of sauce is not enough; came out very dry. If your going to attempt this dish I'd reccomend you only put a little cheese on top and sprinkle the rest throughout because otherwise you end up with a layer of badly burnt cheese on top. I cooked mine for 25 minutes and the top layer was so burnt it couldn't be eaten. I added a LOT of spices to the chicken and sauce but it still turned out very bland. Perhaps trading in the speghetti sauce for alfredo adding some veggies throwing in some ricotta chesse and re-distributing the mozzarella cheese would make this recipie taste better but after all those changes it's really not the same recipie anymore! I did end up eating this because I was starving by the time it was done..",
