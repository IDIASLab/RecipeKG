One tablespoon for even 3 pieces of chicken was way too much for my taste and I love pepper. Also I cooked cooked the chicken according to directions (5-7 min.) and ended up with black chicken on the outside and raw chicken on the center. I had to cut chicken breasts in half and turn down the heat (so as not to burn even further) and cooked about 10 minutes longer in order to be done. Would definitely recommend pounding chicken very thin.",
