The problem is the cheese: you can't get past the Velveeta taste even when you cut the amount in half. No amount of sour cream can disguise that decidedly fake cheese taste. Additionally it's pretty gross when if you have leftover cheese sauce it has congealed into a solid block of goo in the pan. I think the answer might lie in combining sour cream with the spices (and adding chile powder) and mixing in some shredded cheese and then just warm it to serving temperature. The cheese won't be melted but I think it'd have a more natural flavor.",
