Rotini pasta for ease of eating and I think it 'catches' the sauce better. I also chopped up the chicken and the peppers for our kids. Used olive oil not butter. Very pretty when finished with the red and green peppers. Next time I will make a little roue after sauteing to help the sauce thicken. I used quite a bit more seasoning. In the end it was delicious.",

To cut the fat I didn't use the oil, and I used fat-free sour cream (only because I am lactose intolerant and can't handle cream) I can handle sour cream though and I used just less than a cup. It came out like a dream. I used Zatarain's creole spice and I went a little over board. My husband likes it spicy (I don't) but I kept eating anyways, because it tasted so good. Had no lemon pepper so used real lemon juice and then added cut up tomato and diced onion, and used minced garlic instead of powder. Also, cut the chicken into bite size pieces. I will definitely make this again! With just a little less spice. \r\nThanks for a great recipe!!! Anna",

This time I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream and thickened it w/ a little cornstarch. Worked great.I also used just green peppers, the others are so expensive! If I was going to make it for company, I would buy the red and yellow but for the family green is fine. I dont think the flavor suffers, and the kids push half of them to the side of their plates anyway! WE LOVE THIS, YUMMMMM",

I had three chicken breasts so sauteed in 3T butter (& used 1 1/2T cajun seasoning), which may be part of the reason the sauce was so thin.  It didn't need that extra butter.  Probably one, or one & a half tablespoons would be fine for two.  I went for half & half instead of heavy whipping cream (the other recipe with the EXACT SAME NAME - how confusing is THAT?!? -uses half & half).  That's another reason the sauce was so thin.  Although, other reviews (that used heavy whipping cream - & all the butter ... Hmmmm ...  :D) still needed to thicken.  I'll try cooking the chicken; then vegs; then removing & adding flour; then the cream or half & half.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but thin.  'Wasn't spicy enough for me.  It was \"mild\" on the scale of \"mild, medium, hot, extra hot\".  Something to remember, if you have leftovers, the sauce spices up overnight.  Still thin :), but spiced up.  :D  Fresh parmesan cheese is a must for great presentation.  That \"powdered\" stuff doesn't compare.",
