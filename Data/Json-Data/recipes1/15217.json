Three stars, average and kind of boring, the way I had to make it - and four stars had it been prepared the way the submitter intended with the gorgonzola. ",

Exactly as written makes for a lovely vegetarian meal. I have been wanting to make this for a while but Trader Joes has been out of Orzo and I kept forgetting to look for it at the regular market. Ok back to the recipe. I didn't have any veggie broth but I had chicken so I used that. It doesn't matter what liquid you use and the possibilities would be endless. The only other deviation was I didn't have Gorgonzola. I thought I did- we LOVE it but I only had Feta. So in went the Feta. All else I kept the same except I used tomatoes out of my garden chopped and not cherry but a tomato is a tomato right? It was delish with the Feta and I could see adding in Kalamata olives to it for more of a Mediterranean flavor. I think you could also use mozzarella cheese for more of an Italian vibe. I will be making this again with the gorgonzola for sure plus playing around with some additional flavors. Thanks for sharing.",

I found that I like Gorgonzola cheese but it was too over-whelming in this dish. 1/3 of that amount would have been plenty. I didn't appreciate the flavor of th orzo as much once it was browned. It did brown very quickly too so be careful. I used 1 average sized red onion and felt like I could have either chopped it smaller or used less of it. I wish the author specified what size or a quantity of this ingredient to use. Because the flavor of the cheese was so overpowering I added some leftover chicken breast. This didn't help much. The next time I make this I will reduce the amount of cheese by 2/3's and possibly the onion as well. I will also not brown the orzo.",
