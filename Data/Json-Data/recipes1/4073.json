I also added 3 chicken breasts cut into small pieces so my version was more like a REALLY tasty chicken soup. I used ground cardamom and curry spices instead of the actual fresh leaves and pods and tamarind paste instead of extract because of the rarity of the ingredients. Despite the simplifications/substitutions this soup was INCREDIBLE. This is one of the best recipes on the whole site...",

You can substitute a Bay leaf instead as recommended by my Indian friend. It isn't anything like the curry powder which is a combination of the spices used in this recipe (tumeric ginger corriander cumin...etc) This soup was excellent but very spicy. I can usually handle my heat...but this was quite hot! The recipe calls for 2 green chiles chopped up but it doesn't say whether to include the seeds or not. So I included the seeds for one and not the other and I think that made it extremely HOT. We had to eat it with bread...but it's still very yummy. I'll make it again with just one chile next time.",

                "reviewBody": "This is an excellent recipe. I wanted more of a curry and rice intead of soup so I tweaked this in ways that don't really matter so I won't bother to list them here. The recipe on its own is a great one. My observations: 1) it NEEDS salt about 2 teaspoons; 2) if you don't want a spicy soup be sure to clean all of the ribs and seeds out of your chilies before mincing them; 3) if you don't cook the spices in the beginning of the recipe as directed the flavor will be good but will be different than if you'd cooked them; 4) The flavor of cardamom pods differs from that of ground cardamom and the pods are easier to find than the curry leaves so do hunt them down if you can - I bought a jar of cardamom pods at Cost Plus World Market for 3. FYI Indian grocery store items are a GREAT deal as their items tend to be very inexpensive which helps when you're taking on a recipe full of strange ingredients you don't normally have on hand. I went to an Indian grocery store in our area and asked about fresh curry leaves. The store didn't sell them but the proprietor gave me a handful for free (they have a small homemade frozen food section and had the leaves on hand). So if you can't find the leaves it's worth it to ask around even at Indian/Asian restaurants. If you ask where they get the curry leaves they might slip you some just to be nice (and garner your future business).:)",

Immediately after adding the tamarind concentrate I regretted it. The concentrate masked the rich and deep flavors of the soup.
