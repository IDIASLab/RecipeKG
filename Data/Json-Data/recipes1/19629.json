It looked like too much butter after melting, but it did all bake in and the result was crunchy and not as greasy as I feared. Cooking directions worked spot on. I think that Crispix cereal is a tad too sweet for my tastes, but I still liked the end result quite a bit. Following the recipe for cayenne and hot sauce makes quite for almost no heat. If you like a spicy kick I suggest adding more, but the other flavors are quite bold as advertised!",
