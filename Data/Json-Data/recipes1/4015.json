I didn't have green onion on hand, so I used yellow onion, and light beer so it wouldn't overwhelm the soup. I salted and peppered the veggies while they sauteed and I forgot to steam the cauliflower separately, but it cooked perfectly during the 20 minute simmer. I didn't want to use 3/4 cup butter, so I used a few tbsps olive oil, and a couple tbsp light butter. I can't believe how good this soup is - the best soup I've had!

While I loved the chunkiness of the vegetables, the broth itself was watery rather than creamy and even had flecks or grains of cheese in it - not pretty.  I took a guess on what would correct this and added a good chunk of Velveeta, noted for it's smoothness and melting quality.  I can't tell you what an incredible difference this made! The soup was totally transformed and became creamy, rich and smooth! I was so pleased! Even though to start I really wanted to rate this as three stars, the soup ended up being so darn good I didn't want to take the risk of turning anyone off to it. With just this small change of adding Velveeta, this became a five star soup! ",
