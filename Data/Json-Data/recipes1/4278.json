I did\r\nadd a small can of pineapple to the Cool Whip, along with a couple of drops of yellow food coloring, just for a little added touch.  Thanks so\r\nmuch for posting this recipe.\r\n",

I recently had a failure with this type which happened to be a store brand.  Previous times I've used a name brand that only had 1 bag in the box that didn't require beating the eggwhites separately in the box directions.  I also make it in the 9x13 pan ungreased and use a spatula to mix it right in the pan. It does seem to be a little sticky to get out but you can't beat the convenience of throwing three things in a bag to \"Take & Bake\" at another location.",

I iced the cake with a canned cream cheese frosting mixed with more shredded coconut, a few drops of yellow food coloring and a teaspoon or so of coconut extract.  I sprinkled a cup or so of chopped and toasted peacans.  Yum!  I'm sure that my diet is in shambles, but it is worth it!  Hello cake, good bye waistline!",

This batter more than doubles when you're mixing it.  Also, DO NOT UNDERBAKE!  The top needs to be dry & well browned. It will fall in the middle if underbaked.  I usually make this in a 9x13\" pan & depending on the pan, my baking time greatly varies.  The last time I made this, I also inverted the 9x13\" pan on two pieces of wood resting on the pan's handles just as you would a regular angel food cake.  The results were perfect!  **You can also substitute a 20 oz. package of sliced, frozen strawberries (thawed & with the juice) for the pineapple. ",
