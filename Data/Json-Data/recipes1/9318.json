I got home from school and it took me probably 15 minutes to mix the batter up!  It was so quick and easy!  I didn't have the peanut butter cups candy, but I did have the resces chips (mini peanut butter cups that you would use as chocolate chips) so I used those instead.  I had to use less salt because I only had salted butter, and even though the recipe says it makes 12, I got about 30 cookies.  I probably would have gotten more if I hadn't eaten the dough!  Also, use less chocolate chips, the cookies won't be as sweet and overpowering.  I used a natural peanut butter (Skippy no stir natural) and had no problems with consistancy.  Definately a winner!",

I did make a few changes to cut the sweetness - used only 1 cup of sugar increased the peanut butter to 3/4 cup and used natural peanut butter. I also reduced the chocolate chips to 1.5 cups and omitted the peanut butter cups. The dough was a little dry due to the whole wheat flour so I added 3 tbls of milk and baked the cookies for 13mins. Let them sit on the cookie sheet for a good 10mins prior to moving them so they crisp up. They're awesome!!!",
