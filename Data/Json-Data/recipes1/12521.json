I substituted 4 squares unsweetened chocolate, melted with the margarine, for the cocoa, and cut the flour down to 1 1/2 cups.  I added the 1 cup chocolate chips and to produce a more fudgy product, I also cut the baking powder down to 1 tsp.  The result is amazing and hard to believe that they are egg free.  I have tried for years to develop a suitable brownie recipe for my son who is allergic to eggs.  This recipe, with the changes I suggest, is far superior to any I have tried previously.  They definitely pass the brownie test!",

It's definitely more crumbly-cakey than chewy and fudgy. It has an acidic aftertaste as well, and it requires several steps--Not worth it! Perhaps some serious tweaking would fix some of the issues, but as it stands, it's a waste of flour and sugar. We did really enjoy Vegan Brownies by SandyWifey31S. Try that instead.",

I have tried many times to make a brownie using different egg replacers and have never suceeded. Usually it ends up a googey mess or just like a cake. This is great. I made 2 batches the first exactly to recipe - came out a little cakey but great taste. The second lot I followed other reviewers suggestions and add enough milk to be able to \"pour\" the batter into the pan and also added about 1/2 cup of choc chips. This was fantastic!!!! (Not exactly like brownie made with eggs but very very close). Thank you for this recipe.",

I searched ALL OVER the brownie recipes till I found this one because I wanted to make brownies but I had NO EGGS!!! And I can't drive and I couldn't walk to the store at 11:30pm so I was stuck with no eggs. Luckily this recipe came to my rescue!!!hehe It wasn't that hard to make it just took a little while because you have to cook a couple things on the stove before mixing all the ingredients together. I also added extra cocoa and a little milk but if you're vegan and you need it thinned out a little you could always use soy milk I'm sure it'd work just as well. Anyways they were DELCIIOUS!!! They tasted like REALLY GOOD BOXED BROWNIES!!! I always make boxed brownies but I might just make these from now on!!! My brothers sure loved them they've been gobbling them up like hungry monsters!!!hehehehe:P Well MAKE SURE to follow the directions and enjoy!!! God Bless Amy",

While experimenting I made a brownie mix with egg-replacer. They were awful. I made the vegan brownies in allrecipies. They tasted great but were too crumbly for her to take to school. I then made this recipe as written. Compared to the vegan brownies they were rather tasteless but they had a good texture. So i decided to try again but partially follow the advice of another reviewer. I replaced the cocoa powder with 4 squares of unsweetened chocolate and sprinkled in a few mini semi-sweet chocoate chips. I also sprinkled a few of the mini semi-sweet chocolate chips on top before baking. They turned out wonderful and you would never know they don't contain eggs. My daughter's classmates loved them and so did my family. Now I can make brownies that the whole family can eat. (I don't put nuts in because both of my children have nut allergies as well.)",
