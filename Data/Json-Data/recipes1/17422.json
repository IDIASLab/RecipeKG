I used buttermilk (use or lose kind of situation--I tried buttermilk in another smoothie recipe and we really liked it--you should try it, too!) and chunked frozen bananas instead of ice cubes instead of ice for added thickness and fruit. I doubled this for my boys and I and it was just enough for all of us. Very tasty!",

What I liked best about this recipe is that it called for less yogurt than most - enough to give it some thickness and creaminess without giving it that noticeable sour tang. While I did have fresh mango on hand I decided to use frozen and I'm glad I did - I do notice that using frozen fruit does make a difference in making this super cold and refreshing. While I liked the addition of the vanilla I'll either reduce the amount next time or omit it altogether - there was enough in the vanilla yogurt and I think it may have detracted a bit from the full mango flavor. Also since I used frozen mango I think I'll omit the ice cubes next time too - Hubs and I both like our smoothies thick. The slight changes I'd make to this recipe in no way is a criticism of the recipe but only a matter of personal preference. I loved this nice change from the typical berry smoothie!",

I ended up adding a bunch (about 1/3 to 1/2 cup!) of orange-mango-peach juice concentrate to give it some flavor. I don't know if it's too much milk or what. I do see the review of someone saying to refrigerate overnight to bring out the flavor - but if I want a smoothie I'm generally wanting it now - not the kind of thing I'm waiting overnight for.
