In fact my husband asked me to increase the bourbon just slightly so that there is just the hint of bourbon taste. I am thinking I will add another tsp and just keep tinkering to get this to our liking (not that it isn't good as is - thus the 5 stars!). Using different liquors would provide almost endless possibilities. Thanks -",
