The aroma from the crockpot drew that parents and their children to the drink. The taste was lighter that a typical spiced cider (actually much better). The cost of the apple juice for our large group was much more affordable than a cider based drink would have been. We loved it and will use it again!",

Not as 'heavy' as a traditional mulled cider which was nice. I didn't do the orange/whole cloves thingy but it didn't make the beverage lack for anything. We used a nice glass pitcher and had the two cinnamon sticks in it which made the drink look very festive. I should've doubled the recipe and when I make this for Thanksgiving I'll do that and put it in a coffee carafe you know the kind you pump to get the coffee out? or maybe a crock pot turned on low. What a wonderfull smell that would be in the house!!! THis recipe is easy and pretty inexpensive which is SO nice--thanks for a good one!",
