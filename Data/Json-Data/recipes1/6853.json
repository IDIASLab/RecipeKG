If you leave the pie in the fridge it keeps the consistency of the cool whip - not condusive to slicing. If you slice it straight out of the freezer the consistency is much better but you have all these frozen strawberry chunks - not condusive to chewing. I will make this pie again because it is really tasty but I will either puree the berries or leave them out all together. The mixer (I used bacardi) has such great flavor that the pie doesn't really need the berries sad to say.",

Since I don't like desserts that are too sweet and since several reveiwers thought it was I decided to substitute the whipped topping for real whipped cream (unsweetened and stabilized with gelatin). The Bacardi mixer I used and the condensed milk provided plenty of sugar! My mom likes her desserts pretty sweet and she even thought it was great this way. I sliced fresh strawberries thinly and used more than the recipe said. I took it to an event and everyone was CRAZY about it! Very refreshing and cool for the summer!",
