I added chicken bouillon instead of soup and used cream of mushroom soup. I also added more garlic and used red pepper flakes and a little cinnamon. My grandma liked it this way and she hates all seasonings except butter and salt but my husband and I think it needs more tweeking. I will make again because I really think this is a good base recipe. The toasted almonds add a flavor to chicken that we all agreed is very nice. Good recipe just needs more umph.",
