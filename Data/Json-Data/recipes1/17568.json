Consistency was perfect; however, I must agree with other reviewers who commented that it was lacking in flavor.  No salt or pepper in the ingredient list?  I found that odd, especially considering that low-sodium broth is recommended (I used regular) and ketchup is quite sweet.  I tasted the ground meat after it was cooked (I used lean ground pork), and I added both salt and pepper, as well as some Worcestershire, but the dish still ended up quite plain.  \n\nI will make this again, as I am a huge fan of this \"comfort food,\" but I will definitely add onions and garlic when cooking the ground meat, substitute tomato paste for the ketchup and add salt and pepper to taste.",
