I didn't have steak sauce so I just added some salt to taste and I added Grey Poupon mustard instead of mustard seed. I followed other reviewer's suggestions to at least do a full teaspoon of the lemon oil and vinegar. I did 1 1/2 cups of sour cream and 1/2 buttermilk to start for more flavor. And I subbed a clove of fresh crushed garlic for the garlic powder. And it was still totally bland for my tastes. Only after some more doctoring did I arrive at something yummy. I added more buttermilk another clove of fresh crushed garlic and several tablespoons of fresh chopped herbs from my garden (oregano parsley thyme and basil). I also added some dried onion flakes. After all that the dressing turned out really good. My 2-year old son enjoyed dipping steamed green beans into it. The recipe as it is written I'd say is a decent dip or salad dressing base but I don't think it has nearly enough flavor to stand on its own as a dressing. Because I had to doctor it up (beyond the recipe) to make it really good I'm only giving it two stars.",
