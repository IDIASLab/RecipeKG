The grill marks lent for a nice presentation and it was so flavorful. I mistakenly purchased a top sirloin instead of flank steak and was pleasantly surprised when sliced very thin I actually prefer it's slight chewiness (the price was right too!). I mixed up a 1/2 cup lite sour cream a teaspoonful or so of both Dijon & horseradish a bit of honey and spooned a ribbon down the center of the sliced meat on each plate. Thanks Chef John this is a keeper and I am anxious to grill the other steak I have in the freezer already in the marinade.",
