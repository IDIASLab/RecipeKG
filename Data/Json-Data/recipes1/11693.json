I served it with sides of buttered pasta and Italian-style vegetables and we licked the platter clean. As a matter of personal preference I used more garlic and added one chopped bell pepper to the onion and mushroom mix and it came out very well. I also did not have any tomato sauce so I used a partially drained 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes and this worked fine too. For anyone who does not wish to cook with wine I substituted beef broth for the wine and it was still quite flavorful. This is an A recipe! Thanks for sharing it Allana!",

(I needed sauce for the pasta) and finally... 3) saved some clean-up by using an oven-proof pan to brown saute and bake all in the same pan (captured all the great pan juices that way as well).

I used a Pinot Noir wine. I cooked for 1 hour and 15 mintues at 350 degrees they were fork tender! Other reviewers had said theirs were tough so I would cook them as I have described #1 recipe ever! To think I only made these because I had 2 leftover mild Italian sausage links I didn't know what to do with! Served with white minute rice.",

I was in a real cooking mood and I made it with two other recipes off this site that I had never tried and I give them both 5 stars too. What a meal. I made it with Cajun Style Baked Sweet Potao and Awesome and Easy Creamy Corn Casserole. They all cooked at the same oven temperature and they were all done in the same amount of time (45 min.) Prep time for all three dishes was very quick (probably 40 mins. tops). Both the sweet potatoes and pork chops can be prepared earlier in the day. Just pop eveything in the oven at once.",
