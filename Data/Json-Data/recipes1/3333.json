No fresh tomatoes so I used a can of petite diced...added 10 ozs of mixed vegetables (I was a little confused by the directions...said to add green beans, maybe that's what the person who submitted used instead of mixed). Also, I probably used 4 cups of diced sweet potatoes. I also added about 1/4 t. of cayanne pepper to add some kick. Think I'll add a little more next time. My boyfriend and I LOVED this soup, in fact, I'm having it for lunch now as I type this review. Really, really good!!! Will make again.",
