Mixed two egg yolks with the 14ounce can of Eagle sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 cup of lemon juice from freshly sqeezed lemons.  I recommend tasting the mixture so it doesn't become too tart.  Pour in a deep dish 9\" graham cracker crust.  Mix the two egg whites with 1/4 cup of sugar until they are fluffy.  And smooth on the top of the mixture.  Bake until the egg whites slightly brown.  Place in the refrigerator overnight to give the filling time to set.  Enjoy!",

I don't know if that was why the mixture didn't thicken in the double boiler after about 20 hot minutes (It is August!) so I added about two tbls. of corn starch mixed with a little water to make it smooth added it to the double boiler mix and Voila! Nicely thickened. Poured it hot into the baked but lightly baked pie shell topped with meringue made from the eggs plus a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/3 cup sugar added slowly while whipping the egg whites. Baked 15 minutes at 375. Looks great. Tastes great. Oh yes I added the zest from my squeezed lemons cause I like that extra zing.",
