I did make a couple of minor changes: I used ginger snaps for the crust added 1 TB pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and ginger and used fat free evaporated milk. It was awesome! It was so good we ate it up in 3 days (just the 2 of us) and he begged me to make another one. It was so simple to make I didn't mind and for the second batch I substituded 1/2 of the sugar for no-calorie sugar (like splenda for baking) and didn't notice any difference! This will be my go-to pumpkin pie for sure!",

The only thing I add was about 1/2 tsp. ground clove because I like it but I'm certain it would be great without it too. The molasses was the big difference. It's hard to imagine that amount would make that much difference to the taste but it added a wonderful rich flavor that enhanced the pumpkin flavor so well.

After sitting on the counter a bit and then being transferred to the fridge to cool and finish setting it thickened to satisfaction. I haven't tried it yet (waiting for a potluck tomorrow morning) but judging from everyone else' reactions this should be good. Just a note though I've been using the puree from my halloween pumpkins (un-carved they just chilled outside) and the 15 ounce can of premade can be substituted for slightly less than 2 cups of homemade puree. This will just about top out a 9\" deep dish pie plate.",
