I only let mine rise for 3 hours as it was almost doubled from the heat in the garage. Other than outside with the dog I wasn't sure where to get a constant 85-90* temp. So from now on this will be known as the \"garage pizza\" at our house. I didn't have any trouble with the flour/water ratios like it seems others had. I didn't have whole wheat flour. I did use double the yeast because I forgot to scale that down with the rest. I can't possibly imagine this taking 18 hours to prepare. We wanted it today so I had to just make it do. The flavor was like a yeast roll and very good tasted like white bread only not sweet. I'll fix this again as it was perfect for our pizza on the grill experiment. This is the first time we actually got one to turn out and I think the dough is a factor in that. Thanks Chef John even if I did modify it a little.",

I'm not a pro at the pizza dough or anything, but it was way sticky for me to even handle with only 3 cups regular flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat.  After managing the sticky factor everything else went pretty well.  Next time I anticipate a faster process since I will add just a bit more flour to the recipe in the beginning.  My husband and the kids really enjoyed it, although I did burn the cheese on the first one- according to my daughter-since I didn't check it soon enough.",
