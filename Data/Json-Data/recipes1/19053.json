We've affectionately dubbed it \"Pink Stuff\" and use strawberry gelatin. One comment was it was \"gritty\". Do NOT prepare gelatin with water as a remedy. Use DRY gelatin (powder). It probably turned out gritty because it wasn't refrigerated long enough...allow 1-2 hours for the gelatin to dissolve and for the salad to firm up without grit. (I wonder if it's possible that using a \"past its date\" gelatin or a non-Jello brand may cause grittiness? We always use Jello brand and have NEVER had a problem with \"grit.\") Add fresh sliced strawberries and blueberries to the recipe for a REAL yummy treat. Note: I have tried this with \"you-whip-it\" type toppings--both liquid and dry--and they wouldn't set up. We too have had people say they don't like cottage cheese but like this salad. It is debatable whether its a salad or a refreshing light dessert--more like an ambrosia. We have served it both ways.:-) Enjoy!",
