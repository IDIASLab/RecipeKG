However these are only moist enough if you use \"ground turkey\" rather than \"ground turkey breast.\" But then they are definitely not \"low fat\" coming in at almost 50% calories from fat. Will try again adding some conditioning such as egg whites (or egg substitute) and ground oats or whole wheat bread crumbs. Thanks for the idea about the beef boullion.",
