I'm serious, and I know what I am talking about,too...I have this quest for the best ever drop sugar cookie recipe-like Pillsbury, or Betty Crocker, or the already made kind you can buy in just about any grocery store, or Subway cookie-and this may just be the winner! These are awesomeI made these cookies yesterday and they turned out beautifully! And today they are still soft and moist and just as yummy as yesterday! It's not the cakey soft cookie, it's a tasty, chewy, soft, kinda thick sugar cookie (and they look pretty, with a cracked top appearance)! And in my book, thats about as good as you can get! I think that these would work well frosting, too, as long as the frosting is not too sweet, because the cookie is already pretty sweet. No one will believe that you made these yourself! Oh, and don't flatten them before you bake them, just listen to the recipe and they will flatten by themselves, if you don't bake them too long, and if you let them sit for a little bit on the cookie pan. I have no idea why these are not rated at 5 stars right now; I give them ********** ten stars! I encourage any one looking for a scrumptious sugar cookie to definetly try this recipe! I have tried a lot of sugar cookie recipes, and none compare to this one, they all get hard after cooling down, but these stay soft and moist. These are magnificent cookies, exactly what I was looking for!!!!! Thank you so much, Pam!",

(I didn't have any cream of tartar, so I substituted 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 3/4 teaspoons of baking soda for the cream of tarter and baking soda called for in the recipe.) I also rolled some of them in sugar before baking. I liked it both ways. I will probably try rolling some of them in cinnamon and sugar next time. Also, I may try adding some lemon zest sometime, too. It's such a great recipe to either leave alone, or to work your own variations with. 5 STARS!",

These are buttery, light and tender with the characteristic crispiness cream of tartar provides.  I loved 'em.  It's a beautiful and easy dough to work with and does exactly what the recipe says it will.  Delicious just as is, but for Christmas I dipped one half in chocolate ganache and then decorated them with Christmas sprinkles.",

                "reviewBody": "These sugar cookies are awesome! The dough is stiff at first, but this recipe is much easier to make with a heavy duty stand mixer. I sifted all the dry ingredients together before adding to the butter/sugar/egg yolk/vanilla mixture. I added the dry ingredients slowly and let the mixer run for quite a while, scraping down the sides of the bowl. I got a nice firm but pliable dough that was easily rolled into little balls. With the cream of tartar, these remind me of my favorite snickerdoodle recipe. The result out of the oven were uniform, beautiful round cookies that were just slighly golden underneath. When they cooled, the edges were delicately crispy and the centers were soft and chewy. I think in order to get these results, it's a good idea to measure the flour by spooning it into the measuring cup and leveling off with the flat back of a knife. Digging the measuring cup into the bag of flour can compact it too densely resulting in a dry dough that is hard to work with.  These cookies looked gorgeous out of the oven and tasted fantastic!",

So I used a vanilla bean instead. Of course it gives the cookies the little black flecks, but the taste is so much better. I also have never seen cream of tartar here. I know you can use lemon juice or vinegar as a substitute, but I didn't either. I did, however, have a lime in the fridge. I feel like lemons are slightly more acidic, so I used 2 teaspoons of lime juice in place of the cream of tartar. I don't have any kind of electric mixer. So I made these entirely by hand. And when I say hand, I mean hand! The dough is kind of hard to work with using just a spoon. So I literally went hands-in to mix it, as if it was bread dough. But like I said, they turned out great. They were very easy to form into balls for baking.",
