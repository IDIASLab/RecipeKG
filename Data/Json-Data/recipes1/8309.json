Naruto is a fish \"cake\" formed  as a log either in a plastic warp as a round tube shape or on a wooden stick but not as a \"paste\".\nThank you for your share I finally got it right! I didn't realize sake was used, and that makes the flavor so much better. My mom isn't around to make this any more, but now I finally can make it at home for myself. Now I never have to miss this soup ever again.",
