I reduced the soy sauce to 1 TB and increased the garlic and ginger (1 small bulb or about a dozen cloves and 1/4 minced fresh ginger). I think that the cooking time directed may be too long. My quinoa seemed done about 10 minutes sooner than described in the recipe. Over cooking quinoa ruins the texture. It becomes mushy and loses the mild crunchiness it has when cooked until the spirals start showing on the kernels.",
