This recipe is the one I kept coming back to...BUT here's how I ended up making Chicken Spaghetti:\nBoil 2 split breasts with water, carrots, onions, celery, garlic, bay leaf, salt & pepper. Remove the breasts, strain & de-fat the broth. Ladle about a cup of broth into a bowl; set aside. Pour the rest of the broth back into pot & set aside.  Skin and debone the breasts when they're cool enough to handle. Chop the meat into bite size pieces; set aside. Bring the broth (and more water if needed) to a boil & cook the pasta per pkg. directions. Return drained, rinsed pasta to pot; set aside. Saute 1 c. each chopped onions and bell peppers in 1 - 2 T. butter till soft. Add 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can mild Rotel tomatoes, 2 c. shredded Cheddar & Monterey Jack cheese, season to taste with garlic powder, salt, & pepper. If consistancy is too thick add some of the reserved broth. Stir in the chopped chicken. Pour mixture over pasta and stir till well blended. Transfer all to a casserole dish, bake in preheated 350 degree oven 10 to 15 minutes, sprinkle with shredded cheese, and continue baking 15 more minutes or till bubbly.\nNote: 1 spilt breast yields about 1-1/2 c. of chopped meat.

I have to tell you.... it was a disappointment. If you haven't tried whiskey is this dish... you are missing an extra star! It is FABULOUS!! Be brave! Give it a try!!!\n\nI had to make adjustments based on what I had in the kitchen. Only used green peppers, substituted onion flakes and used whiskey instead of white wine (as suggested by another reviewer). Plus I did add the garlic powder to spice it up...... garlic in everything I say!! All in all, my husband and I had never had spaghetti and chicken before, but LOVED IT and have found a new way to enjoy spaghetti!!",

Archer Farms (Target) Roasted Garlic and Herb EVOO just for extra flavor for a few minutes while the spaghetti noodles were cooking. I omited the onion since hubby doesn't like onion and used two cans of cream of mushroom soup from the other reviewers. I'm glad I used two cans because other wise I think it would have been too dry. Instead of the 1/4 c white wine I used 1/2 c chicken broth just to have a little more liquid. I also boiled the chicken breasts for 30 minutes took them out and added the spaghetti to the \"chicken water\" so it would give it more flavor too. I baked it covered for the first amount of time and uncovered once I put the cheese on top. I will defiantely make this again! Thank you for the recipe and the other reviewers suggestions.",
