I brushed the pastry sheets with butter and then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  After they came out of the oven, I brushed them with a 1-1 mix of butter and honey.  I was making them for our church coffee hour when my husband snagged one and then proceeded to sneak more!  Then my 9-year-old son got into the act and I ended up running back to the store for more pastry puff sheets!!!!!  A real keeper.  Thanks!!",
