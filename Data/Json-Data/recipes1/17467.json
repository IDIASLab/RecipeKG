Tip:  When forming the sausage into patties - use a bit of flour on your hands, it keeps the sausage from sticking to your hands and makes forming the sausage around the egg easier.",

                "reviewBody": "What a wonderful discovery. I have had Scotch eggs in pubs but the idea of frying these in oil left me hesitant to make these as a rgular treat at home. This recipe is terrific and I have made it three times in the last couple of weeks. Here are a few tips.....make sure your hard boiled eggs are cold and dry before you try to wrap them in sausage. Wet your hands to keep the sausage from sticking to your hands. I put about 1/4 lb of sausage in my damp palm and make a little nest to put my egg in and then form the sausage around the rest of the egg. I think 1 lb. of sausage is just right for 4 large eggs as Baking Nana mentioned in her review....so 2 lbs sausage for 8 eggs. The last time I made these I forgot to dip the sausage wrapped eggs in milk before crumbs and we could not tell the difference without the milk step. In the future I will skip that step entirely. I used chicken breakfast sausage to cut the fat too. I do not buy shake and bake but I used this recipe and reduced to 1/4 of the amount to make my own shake & bake with AR's recipe: Homemade Shake and Bake Mixture. (I used 1/2 cup Panko & 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs in my shake and bake for a crispier crust) Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!",

By accident I had the ingredients on had this morning for a hearty Saturday morning brunch...or so I thought. I had purchased Jimmy Dean hot pork sausage to make sausage balls next weekend for an adult Halloween party but at a gathering last night I overheard the hostess saying she was making meatballs so \"Scotch Eggs\" was a good use of pork sausage that I rarely buy. I don't typically buy Shake and Bake either but had seen a recipe here for homemade then discovered I had no breadcrumbs or celery salt and nearly no Panko. I toasted some sliced sourdough bread combined it with the little bit of Panko crumbs I had seasoned it following the Shake and Bake recipe and added some ground red pepper ground coriander poultry seasoning and extra garlic powder for more flavor. I used 4 left-over extra large hard-boiled eggs I had cooked earlier in the week for deviled eggs and the whole pound of sausage. I had no problems molding the sausage to the eggs but I did make sure the eggs were dry as another reviewer suggested and I used an egg to dip into instead of milk. The baking time was perfect and my husband must have said how much he loved these six times during the meal and again while doing dishes. I over-did the red pepper for my taste but he loves spicy-hot food so he said not to change a thing and to make them again.",
