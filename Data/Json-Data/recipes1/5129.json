I cannot imagine cooking this the way it is BUT I will say that it is a very good base recipe to \"create your own\" casserole. To cut back on time I took some chicken that was already cooked and cooked it in butter with some chopped garlic, onion, pimentos (would have used red bell pepper but did not have it) and mushrooms. I set that aside and mixed 2 cans of cream of chicken with 1 cup of sour cream and about half a cup of milk to thin it up some. I mixed a ton of seasonings in this (garlic salt, onion powder, Ms. Dash, thyme, pepper). I then mixed a large can of mixed vegetables, a can of peas, a can of green beans, and a can of corn into the chicken mixture. Then I combined the soup mixture into the vegetable mixture and added some sharp cheddar cheese. I did as others suggested and mixed melted butter into the crackers before spreading them on top.With all of the additions this is a lot like a quick chicken pot pie without the crust. Fun to jazz up and a good way to get the kids to eat veggies.",
