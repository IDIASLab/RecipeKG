I'll admit I skimped on ingredients- I didn't use pure maple syrup just what I had in the pantry. I also didn't have fresh sage so I used dried. I kept the flavors the same but I made the sauce differently than called for in the recipe. I used fresh cranberries and cooked them in the cranberry juice with 1/2 C of OJ brown sugar and a little cinnamon. Brought to a boil and cooked the cranberries down. I simmered until the turkey was done then added the drippings to the cranberry mixture before adding in corn starch slurry. Raves all around people topped EVERYTHING on their plates with it and kept asking for the recipe.",

I bought a 9 lb. turkey - just a small one to feed my family of 4 and a friend that is visiting us from NJ. I was all set to make the gravy - had all of the ingredients ready but when I took the turkey out of the wrap - BONUS - Butterball know includes a concentrated turkey gravy in the cavity of their turkeys! Change of plans - as I wasn't sure how my family would have liked the cranberry pan gravy anyway - so I went with the included gravy packet and prepared it as directed on the packet. It was delicious gravy by the way. I did add a bit of olive oil to the lemon juice (because I wanted the skin to crisp up nicely) and also gave it a sprinkle of salt and pepper before placing in the oven. As for the maple syrup I read other reviewers comments that the drippings were too sweet so I just basted the turkey twice maybe using 1/8 of a cup of syrup just enough to coat the bird but not so much that it was dripping down. It added just the right amount of sweetness for us. Yum!",

The maple gave the turkey just the right about of sweetness (not overpowering) and the cranberry gravy was off the chain. Served with a side (I chose carrots) you have the perfect meal. We ate EVERY BIT of this turkey in about two days (even using the bones for a soup and a stock). Outstanding.",
