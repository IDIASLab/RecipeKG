I was a bit leary of too much wine vinegar and how that would taste so I only used 1/2 cup of that less brown sugar (also around 1/2) and whole cloves instead of ground. Even though these changes I still think it deserves a high rating and we very much enjoyed this meal. Thanks for a great post ProfPam!",

I used a large oven-proof frypan with a tight fitting lid went right from stove to oven. The recipe says \"wine vinegar\" - I assumed this was red wine vinegar and it came out fine. Also the recipe calls for 1/4 tsp ground cloves but the instructions refer to \"whole cloves\" only. I scattered 6 whole cloves over the mix just before putting it in the oven. We ate it straight like a stew but it would be super over pasta or if you are really hungry mashed potatoes! Great reheated the next day.",
