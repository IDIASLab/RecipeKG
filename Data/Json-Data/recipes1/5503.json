I cut the butter in half (1/2 cup), tripled the garlic, cut the broth in half, kept the wine, lemon, and everything else the same. Corn starch thickened it up nicely and lots of capers made this dish wonderful. Thanks.",

I did not bread the sole before frying it because I thought the addition of the sauce would make it soggy. The sauce itself is good, but I took others' suggestions and halved the butter (I actually quartered it, using 1/4 cup butter and then used 1/4 olive oil), and used 1/2 cup white wine as well. I also doubled the amount of lemon, added a 1/4 cup of parsley, then added some drained capers before thickening the sauce with some cornstarch. After all the modifications, the result was VERY yummy (and I'll make it again), but since so many modifications were needed, I'm only giving it 3 stars. I agree with other reviewers that after modifications, it would be really good on other fish and seafood (I'm thinking shrimp).",

I would reccomend tho cut the entire sauce recipe in half - its way too much for 4 fillets of fish. But again super super yummy recipe - thanks!",
