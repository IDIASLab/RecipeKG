This is a good option for someone who prefers chocolate over raisins (because after all raisins are just wanna-be chocolate chips) or someone who likes a hearty not too sweet cookie. I used olive oil almonds and regular oatmeal. Stirring the dough took a little elbow grease -- at the end I had more success with a wooden spoon than the electronic beaters. I did end up adding a splash of milk to make it easier to work with. This dough does NOT keep well so bake right away. The cookies do not spread out very much so you can load the pan pretty closely.",

Thanks for a great recipe. Additional Note! I made these again a couple of weeks later and (still) didn't have any chocolate chips and put in a heaping 1/2 cup of toffee chips. Wonderful.....",

Basically you can use whatever you have in your pantry and I bet these cookies will still rock. The batter is a bit dry (I squished the balls real good) and my cookies DID spread (some turned into cookie bars- still Mmm) and in 10 minutes some of them did burn on the bottom so make sure you keep a close watch over them. btw GRAPE NUTS RULE!!:D",
