I do not have a juicer, so I ran this through my food processor to get it pretty fine, and then through my blender on the \"liquify\" setting to turn it into juice.  I assume a juicer is much more effective at making juice, as I found I had to add some liquid to this in order to get it to the desired consistency.  I have some fresh apple cider from going apple picking recently, so I added a little of that to get this nice and liquidy.  I realize that added some sugar, which is probably not the goal of a recipe like this, but it wasn't much, and it made it just sweet enough that my daughter actually likes it quite a bit.  What a yummy and great way to get some extra fruits and veggies in our diets- fresh and healthy :)  Thanks for sharing the recipe Raina!",
