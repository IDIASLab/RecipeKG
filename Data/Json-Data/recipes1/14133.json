I made with 4.5 -5 and they were still tender and light. Tasted great but could go for more apple flavor... as well as more cinnamon and nutmeg. I think next time I'll try replacing half the buttermilk with applesauce instead... or maybe a little apple juice concentrate instead of some of the sugar.",
