Next time I will add sugar to the base - I loved the flavour of the nuts but it was just butter and flour - bland. I normally reduce the amount of sugar in recipes but for this one definately add sugar. I will try maybe 1/3 cup of sugar(powdered?). Or you could use a cheesecake base for this recipe (graham cracker crumbs and butter). I also didn't have chocolate syrup so used melted dark chocolate instead which tasted really good. Thanks for the recipe its a keeper!",

I also added about 1 tsp of cinnamon to the filling cause that's how I like my latte! I did dissolve the coffee in about 2 Tbs of coffee liquor. I like my coffee! I made mine in a springform pan and it made serving extra simple. Also made a beautiful presentation with a little drizzle of chocolate syrup on the plate and a dollop of whipped cream on top. Everyone was impressed with the looks and even more impressed with the taste.",

This should make it easier on my arteries & have a lighter latte flavor. A good starter for those of us who like to experiment.",
