My daughter who absolutely HATES nuts, and my son who isn't especially fond of coconut, couldn't stay away from these.  Nobody could!  These easy things were the holiday favorites at the parties I took them to, and it made me wish I hadn't wasted my time on all the other difficult desserts I also brought (and ended up bringing back home).\n\nI *would not* line the pan with foil--I believe it would tear when cutting and get stuck in the cookie bars.  Eeww.  I used a glass dish *without* greasing it first, and it wasn't a bad clean-up at all.  Do chill the bars before cutting, and cut the bars into SMALL servings, as a little goes a long way with this super-rich recipe.\n\nI definitely would mix the graham crackers and melted butter next time, pressing them firmly into the pan, and then greasing the dish might be a good idea.  I might also try semi-sweet chocolate chips, as this recipe is ultra-sweet.",

When I left the States in 1974 and settled in Australia my biggest problem was that I couldn't get graham crackers so I substituted a \"Coffee\" biscuit. This worked fine. The only other change I make is to pour the condensed milk over all the layers just before I put it in the oven. This seems to bind everything together and the top then turns a lovely golden brown when cooked. This is always a hit at any gathering.",
