I tried an 8x8 glass pan and failed 3 times, they were either burned or not cooked in the center.  Finally i turned to a 8x8 nonstick and voilla.  Perfection.  Make sure to greease and flour the pan.  I added a bit more cream cheese (about half of a 250 g package).  Bake at 350 for 37 minutes and then turn off the oven and leave them in for 10 or 15 more minutes.  This insures they are cooked through while making sure the sides don't burn. Fantastic, thanks a bunch for sharing.",

I only had 2 ounces of chocolate so I had to substitute the other 2 ounces with 6 tablespoons of baking cocoa powder and 3 tablespoons of oil I also baked it for 5 min. less than the required time. But besides those minor changes I followed the directions exactly and they came out great! I encourage anyone who reads this to go ahead and make it for yourself. If you love brownies and cheesecake you got to try this one! Thanks for the recipe",

                "reviewBody": "These brownies were not very good. I like the idea of the cream cheese topping. But I didn't care for the brownie base. The batter was very liquidy and then real fudgy after baking. I used 2/3 cup chocolate chips (4oz)to replace the baking chocolate which is basically the same. But I like a more cake like homemade brownie. Possibly using cocoa and oil like another reviewer it may have gotten more cake like. I had to take them out of the oven before the cheesecake topping got to browned. But the brownie part seemed undercooked unless that was supposed to be the texture? Only about 3 brownies got eaten from the pan which is not normal in my home. I am going to stick to the Mmmm Mmmm Brownies I found on this site. I can always modify them.",
