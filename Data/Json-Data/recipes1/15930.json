I used Reese's pieces, Reese's peanut butter cups, Almond Joys, KitKats, and Hershey bars so there was quite a variety of chocolate and crunch.  I still have mega-amounts of candy left so I'm planning to make another pan (or two) and just put in the freezer for unexpected company.  Thanks for the great idea!",

The recipe was easy to follow, and my children (ages 5 & 2) were able to participate in every step.  They especially enjoyed picking out the candies.  Instead of mixing in the candies, we placed them on top of the batter before baking.  Super yummy!",
