Anytime a recipe calls for shrimp, I cook the shrimp in boiling water for 3 minutes, then rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. At the last minute, I add the shrimp to the sauce and heat just long enough to warm the shrimp. In my opinion, slow cooked shrimp turns out \"spongy\" and \"mushy\". Some reviewers said this recipe was a little bland, so I added 4-5 tablespoons of cayenne pepper to the boiling water before cooking the shrimp. YUM! Thanks, will definitely make this again.",

The fresh herbs really add great taste, and mincing the garlic instead of using a press gave the dish a definite garlic zing without being too strong. I'll be making this many more times!",

Now let me tell you it was yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmy. I did make some changes. I did not have 12 tablespoons (I was doubling) of butter on hand, so I used 6 tablespoons butter and 6 tablespoons of margarine, I also added about 1/2-1 teaspoon crushed red pepper, and about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of salt (did not measure these just poured into hand LOL), and then the last change I did was I did not add the sauce to the pasta I let everyone put their own sauce on, so what I did with the cheese I put oh about 3/4 cup of cheese (did not double) to the sauce (to thicken the sauce) when I added the crab then I put the cheese on the table so people could add more if they wanted it, and everyone said that the amount of cheese was just right. Will make this again and again, next time I think I will try it with a mix of crab and shrimp, and some green onions.  Thanks for posting this yummy recipe.",

I substituted 1 c. 1% milk for the heavy whipping cream (and thickened the sauce with a couple tbs of flour), 2 tbs dried basil instead of 3 tbs fresh, and left out the parsley.  I also added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to give it a kick, although I wish I had either used a little less of that or just omitted the black pepper instead, as it was a tad spicy.  The sauce turned out super creamy and delicious, not too thick but not too thin.  We poured it over whole wheat thin spaghetti and steamed broccoli florets.  My fiance and I both loved it and can't wait to make it again!",

Instead of garlic cloves, I used garlic powder & onions. I also added some chopped bell pepper. Instead of 6 tablespoons of butter, I used 1/4c of butter & 2 T of vegetable oil. (would have preferred olive oil -but was out.) Instead of heavy cream, I followed two suggestions & used 1c of 2% milk with 2t of corn starch & some sour cream for flavor. I will definitely make this again. I'm going to try it with chicken tenderloins & mushrooms. Thanks so much for the restaurant quality dish. With a tossed salad & garlic bread this is a great dish to serve guests.",
