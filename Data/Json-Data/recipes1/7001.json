First I always double this recipe. I also don't use the cheese. Instead I add one of the cans of clams with it's juice so it's not to dry. Next I add 3 - 6 slices of raw bacon cut very small (it's best to do this when the bacon's frozen) which cooks completely during the alloted time. I also use a small jar of pimentos minced for color. Hope you enjoy.",

This reminded me very much of Clams Casino or stuffed clams minus the clam shell. It also looked exactly like turkey stuffing! The only thing I plan to change is to reduce the butter...it was swimming in it. The butter made it moist but a little clam juice in place of the butter may work. It took me a lot longer than 5 minutes to prep...(I can't even make scrambled eggs that fast!)...I hand minced my veggies it took me about 25 minutes. Overall very good and I will be making this appetizer again!",
