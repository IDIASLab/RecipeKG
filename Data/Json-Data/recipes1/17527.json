Though this is possible to do in a pinch, the baklava really does need the full 8 hours to soak up the syrup in order to have the optimal moist texture. I have tried it both ways, and the traditional 8 hours is much preferable to people I serve this to.  Enjoy!",

I did make a couple of tweak, as I grew up with baklava (am half Greek) and had some Nana memories to work from. I added honey to the syrup. Can't really say how much, as I was making a double batch, and doing things to taste. Also, I didn't add cloves to the syrup (didn't have any whole) so instead added ground cloves and a tablespoon of allspice to the walnuts, decreasing the cinnamon and omitting the nutmeg (the later wasn't a flavor I remembered in Nana's delicious baklava). those were my only changes, I  followed the ratios of phyllo to walnuts mixture religiously, and let the syrup soak in for about 12 hours ( in the fridge). The results were moist, syrup soaked pastries that were still crisp and fabulous. As I said, rave reviews!! People went out of their way to tell me how perfect they were. :)",

After brushing butter on each piece of phyllo and putting together the pan of baklava there was still about a cup of butter left. Since I have made baklava before with a Turkish girlfriend I remembered that she just poured about a cup of melted butter over her layers of nuts and dough so that's what I did with the rest and it turned out great. Next time I make this I'll use a lot less cinnamon--it's just not a taste I associate with baklava although it wasn't bad. I'll definitely use this recipe again but with a few tweaks. I also used the suggestions in the All Recipes magazine of cutting down the syrup to 1 1/4 cups water and 1 1/2 cups of sugar with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and only let the syrup soak in for 2 hours before eating.",

I don't know what to do since this is my first time I'm not sure how thick its suppose to be or if I should go ahead and pour it on still or start over with the syrup///anybody there to help? Maybe I should add honey to it to firm it up some. I've read other reviews that say \"The syrup should be hot when poured over the cooled pastry. There s one rule for adding sugar syrup to baklava: The temperature of the pastry must be opposite that of the syrup. I had always been advised to pour cold syrup over hot-from-the-oven pastry. But the baklava was never quite as crisp as I wanted; the hot pastry absorbed the syrup readily and softened quickly. So I decided to try pouring hot syrup over cooled pastry which worked beautifully. Letting the pastry cool and settle kept the layers separate and crisp even after adding the syrup.\" It has a very distinct cinnamon flavor but that's ok with me.",
