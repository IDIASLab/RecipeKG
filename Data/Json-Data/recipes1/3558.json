Wonderful flavor...a very hearty meal when combined with Parmesan Herb bread from this site!",

I made some adjustments that my family absolutely loved - even my very fussy 3 yr old. I omitted the ketchup and basil, as I'm not really fond of basil combined with beef. I instead added a dash of worchestershire sauce, 1 bay leaf, 1 tbsp dried oregano, plus some about 2 tbsps chopped fresh parsely. Additionally, for flavor, I included 2 finely diced garlic cloves and a 1/2 cup of barley. I think the barley really makes this soup really hearty and tasty, not to mention nutritious! You just add the barley in at the beginning with all the other ingredients and you're ready for a great, cozy winter meal! ",

I use cubed potato, and add the liquid from the canned veggies, use low-salt beef broth, make a bouquet garnii with bay leaf, oregano, rosemary, dill weed(use in place of salt), and whatever else you desire. Add heat, or not, and it still will come out delicious and satisfying.  Make the soup your own.",

Hubby brought home tomato sauce and diced tomatoes that were seasoned with garlic, oregano and basil. And was worried that I'd over power it with the added dried basil in the recipe, but as a result...it didn't. Hubby said it was by far the best batch of Hamburger Soup yet. So I'm shining my apple on my shoulder so to speak and going to keep doing it with the seasoned tomatoes and sauce....yumm-O. Thanks very much!",
