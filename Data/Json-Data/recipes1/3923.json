Make sure you have enough sauce and it will cook itself.  I make the same thing in a crockpot, but use rigitoni and cook it on low for at least 4 hours depending on how soft you like your macaroni.  Stir the crockpot after two hours to make sure that all the pasta is covered. You can add cooked ground beef or loose sausage to your sauce for more flavor and skip the nutmeg.  Make enough extra sauce to add when served if you want more.",

I used bow ties instead of ziti because that's what we had in the pantry but almost any kind of small pasta should work. To spice up the sauce add 1/2 teaspoon ground marjoram 1/2 teaspoon ground thyme 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 bay leaf 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (or more to taste). I used 1 teaspoon salt instead of 1/2 teaspoon. Alternatively you can add about 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning instead of the basil marjoram thyme and oregano (more or less to taste). Add 1 small can mushrooms to the sauce. Remove the bay leaf before assembling. Top the entire dish with a sprinkle of grated mozzarella cheese about ten minutes before it's ready. Add grated parmesan cheese on top after plated. Serve with caesar salad and garlic bread.",
