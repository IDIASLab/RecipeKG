                "reviewBody": "Very easy to make and fun to eat! I plan on making these again but with some variations: almond extract instead of peppermint or mini chocolate chips mixed with the meringue (or sprinkled mini chips on top of the unbaked cookie). Another possible variation: a well-drained maraschino cherry (without stem) in the center instead of the chocolate kiss and omitting the peppermint extract. While my young daughter likes to eat these cookies I still plan on making them by myself (raw egg whites). I didn't give this recipe 5 Overall stars because it seems to need something mainly presentation-wise. I think some finely shaved chocolate or jimmies sprinkled on the unbaked meringue would \"dress up\" the cookie a bit. Tips on making the cookie: avoid air-pockets between the meringue and the kiss and use two baking sheets -- you can fit the whole recipe on both sheets and get the whole batch in the oven at one time.",

I remember buying meringue nest in different colours at easter time for 5 or 10 cents. I wanted my children to have the same experience as me to remember. This recipe worked great. Didn't bother with any flouring just a little food colouring. Then piped birds nest on the cookie sheet and baked as directed. We finished them off by putting some tiny easter eggs in them.. so easy and so good... thanks",
