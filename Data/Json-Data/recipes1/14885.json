Changes: I cut the sugar down by 1/4 cup (I generally do this in recipes); used Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips instead of chopping 8 oz; and melted the chocolate in the microwave for 1 min stirred then 20 seconds more in the mic instead of the double boiler. Other than those changes I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will mix the semisweet chocolate chips in so that there can be gooey chocolate bits throughout.",

For the powdered sugar I put about 1/4 cup in a strainer then tapped the strainer over the brownies to make a nice topping. Due to allergies I left out the nuts. They weren't gooey at all and they're more of a cake-like texture. The kids want me to make them again tomorrow!",

They were very thick and took longer to cook but were delicious. I also butter my pans and use white sugar to dusk instead of flour. It gives a sweeter crunchier more pleasing result than the taste of flour. They were more of a cake than a fudgier brownie but he loved them and they were for him. They are very rich with the additional chocolate chips on top. Again I would do them without it but \"he\" prefers them this way.
