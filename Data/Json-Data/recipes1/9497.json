The tortillas got soggy and although it smelled good it tasted so mushy that it was hard to enjoy (and I baked it for 65 minutes). I would highly recommend to those who try this to please add the crumbled sausage. As for me I MIGHT try this again WITH the meat and try it with flour tortillas. Otherwise would not recommend.",

When I was done browning I added a packet of taco seasoning and it brought the recipe together. I also added jalpeno's as well. Made fresh guac. and sour cream and salsa afterwards. Super easy to make and virtually impossible to mess up. Next time I'll add more ingredients. This is a great starter recipe to build upon.",

We have between 40-50 people every year and they always ask, \"Did you make the mexican one?\"- as they call it.  I have developed only 4 staple casseroles worthy of a Christmas brunch, while trying about 3 new ones a year.(That's about 30 casseroles that didn't make the cut).  This is definately one that will never leave my menu. My husband gets mad if there are no leftovers, so this year I may even double it!  Thanks Raquel!",
