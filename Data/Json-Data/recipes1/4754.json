What I do to add extra flavor is I melt the butter and also fry a clove or two of minced garlic in it and then once the butter is melted it sits for twenty minutes to meld the garlic flavor into the butter. I then dip the chicken in the garlic butter and then into the breadcrumb/cheese mixture. Add a little more cheddar on top toward the end of baking. This is some of the moistest chicken I've had.",

Used shredded colby/jack mix instead - and when the coating really wouldn't stick to the chicken at all - I lost faith and only used 2 whole chicken breasts vs the 8 halves the recipe called for - and broiled the rest *plain* to use as backup if this turned out inedible.  In my disgust, I threw the rest of the butter and cornflake/cheese mix on top of the two breasts and put it in the oven - and WOW was I sorry I didn't use more chicken!!  We LOVED the recipe - and wolfed down the pitiful two breasts I made and were both sorry I ever doubted all the reviews.  VERY tasty - though it didn't seem like it would work out well at first - this one will definitely be made again (and the colby/jack cheese turned out great - almost hesitant to use cheddar next time - since why mess with perfection?)\r\n\r\nThanks so much for a fantastic easy and tasty recipe!",

I followed all recipe instructions except I added a pinch of garlic powder and used less butter (perhaps I shouldn't have cut down on the butter?). Also I used freshly shredded parmesan which probably did not mix as well as the grated kind. But the upshot is: it tasted like someone had prepared their morning cornflakes on top of my chicken.
