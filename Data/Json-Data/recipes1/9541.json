I also added a small amount of corn, but next time will double it (I suggest about 1 cup). I also added lots more enchilada sauce--actually the whole jar! My husband's comment was, \"You can definitely make this one again!\" My daughter's comment was \"Just a little too spicy\"...but then again, she did eat it right up! :)  To go with this recipe, I made the 'Salad de Colores' found on this website--and the two go marvelously together!",

It was all really good, but it makes a LOT of food! I took the extra leftovers to work the next day, and people were asking for the recipe! I think it would be especially good to use with leftover mashed potatoes, otherwise it is a little bit time consuming.",
