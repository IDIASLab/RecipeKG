I was going for a lower fat healthier recipe and subbed neufchatel cheese (low fat cream cheese) and splenda. The result was awful. Also used low fat sour cream in the topping with splenda and that turned out ok. I used \"Barefoot Contessa's\" lemon curd and it was just awful. I will never purchase that brand again. Anyways...all I'm saying is that this is just one of those recipes that does not adapt well to low fat ingredients. A lot of pricey ingredients to waste on this experiment - just trying to save others from the same results.",

The texture is not creamy but thick and eggy, almost grainy. The flavor is a very unpleasant fake lemon from the lemon extract.  This could have benefited with just the vanilla extract alone (or even vanilla and real, fresh lemon juice) and two less eggs - one egg per package of cream cheese is always a good rule of thumb.  Moreover, there was too much of the sour cream topping for the amount of filling.   Very disappointing, since I had covered it with a homemade Meyer lemon curd which had really turned out beautifully.",
