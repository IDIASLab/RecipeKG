This recipe sounded like the one I buy so I gave it a shot. I waited until the deluxe mix nuts in the 17.5 oz. can was on sale at CVS and saved about 5.00. And I bought milk chocolate M'M's Because my husband likes them best. Easy and quick to mix and saves me a lot of money in the long run! Also you can alter the amounts a tad to your likeing.Thank-you so much FBGirl1.",
