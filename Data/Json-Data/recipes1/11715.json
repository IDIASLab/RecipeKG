Also when you bring them to a boil lower the heat and partially cover the pot. A mexican olla traditionally used to cook beans has holes in the cover to let steam escape.They should be cooked at a simmer not a full boil. If you need to add water add hot water from a kettle or tea kettle on the stove top. Never add cold water..it lowers the temp too much! Finally when you cook the onions add the garllic only after the onion has turned translucent... browning the garlic will make it bitter! This is a great dish for all of us bean lovers. I've made it as directed and also have added cooked and crumbled chorizo... great both ways! Thanks!",

It's hard to believe how good it is for you. I must admit I am on a salt free diet so I used a salt free seasoning I found at Costco. For convenience I just threw in canned beans for all three types. Because it sounded like there should be some liquid after boiling the beans though not specifically stated I drained them into a measuring cup and 'replaced' the 1 1/2 cups of juice with a salt-free chicken broth. Everyone at work loved it with our BBQ over the usual beans that appear.",

PERFECT amount of heat! I also threw in some yellow bell pepper that I had to use up.  For those that are indecisive on the cinnamon - OMG! you HAVE to make sure you add it in! This IMO makes this dish amazing! As another reviewer stated, it brings a whole other dimension of flavour! So....what are you waiting for? Get out the stock pot and make a batch TODAY! ;)",
