They puffed up quite a bit during baking, so I was worried about how I was going to get the cherry pie filling to stay on the top, but as they cooled they shrunk back down quite a bit, leaving a nice little well in the center for the pie filling. I made these for a Christmas party and everyone seemed to enjoy them. The only thing I'd do different next time is leave out the nutmeg. It really overpowered the \"cheesecake taste\" of these goodies, almost giving them an eggnog or custard-like taste, so I really think they would be alot better without the nutmeg. Overall a great recipe though -- Thanks! :)",

I was looking for something quick and easy and bite-sized for dessert and I remembered these, hoping I'd find the recipe here and voila!  I left out the nutmeg and added a little bit of lemon zest in its place.  I also find these \"fit\" best when you put the cookie in bump-side-down.  Don't worry if they don't go all the way to the bottom of your muffin tin--the wafer will soften during baking and it will sink.  (If you use Reynold's foil mini muffin liners, they're a little too big for mini muffin tins anyway and they actually work perfectly for this recipe.  Again, no worries that they don't hit the bottom of each muffin cup.  It's okay!)  This recipe makes at least 44 (not 24, the way the recipe states) and I always fill the cup with filling.  It collapses after baking.  Thanks for this oldie but goodie!  Nice to have these back in my recipe box.  :)",
