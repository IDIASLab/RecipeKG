My husband's favorite dessert is peanut butter pie and he was practically licking his plate. And I don't feel so bad making this for him because it was half the calories of another version I made. This is definitely a keeper. Note: reduced fat pb often has added sugar and hydrogenated oils which makes have the SAME number of calories as regular pb. For healthier reduced fat pb I get the all natural kind with no salt or sugar added and skim off 5 tbsp oil off the top before stirring. Store at room temperature. This only saves you 1g fat per serving of pb (2 tbsp) but saves 38 calories per serving and you'll also be cutting out artery clogging transfat.",

I also used a chocolate crust and sprinkled choc chips and pb chips on top. I melted a handful of choc chips with a splash of milk and drizzled this over everything. This was so good! I think I might try adding a little cream cheese next time. A hint: microwave a frozen slice on power 2 for 10 seconds and it turns out perfectly defrausted. Thanks for the excellent recipe I will definately make this again!",
