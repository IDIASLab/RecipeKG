Note that my version is NOT SWEET AT ALL Also I used my oven since I do not own a bread machine... I used 250g flour 1 egg 1tsp baking powder 1/2tsp baking soda 3tbl sugar 1 tbl oil 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 200g applesauce. The trick to not making it dense is to not over mix the dough. So first combine all the dry ingredients except the sugar. Then combine all the wet ingredients plus the sugar (separately from the dry). Then sift the dry ingredients into the wet and FOLD in with a silicone spatula. Do NOT beat the mixture. Just mix so that the batter is still lumpy but all the flour looks incorporated. Then bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes and check with a tooth pick. If you follow these tips you will have a light not dense bread to enjoy!:)",
