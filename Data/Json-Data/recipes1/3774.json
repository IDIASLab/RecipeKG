I also just use one of those individual servings of applesauce, since that's all we ever have around.  Although I wouldn't call this my favorite muffin recipe, the muffins keep well, travel well, freeze & reheat well, plus they are a snap to make.  Finally, I haven't met a kid yet who doesn't like them, including my picky middle child who has a penchant for those huge \"name-brand\" grocery store muffins.  Although they don't taste very much alike, he finds these to be an acceptable substitute.",
