LOL  I think 1/2 cup of one or a little less than 1/2C of each is perfect!!  If you do chocolate chips only, try using a mixture of semi-sweet and milk chocolate.  It's an amazing blend that I always get comments on!!!  Second, mine turns out perfect using just a 14oz (1 cup) can of fat-free sweetened condensed milk.  Thought that may help someone when trying to decide what can to buy w/o pre-measuring.  I just drizzled all over, and it covered it perfectly!  Lastly, when I don't have a box of graham cracker crumbs, I just use quick oats, and it still turns out good!  I like to individually wrap these in plastic wrap so the kids can just grab and go.  I'd say \"grab and share\" but they'd prefer eating the whole thing themselves!",
