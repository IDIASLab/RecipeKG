Then after it was all done and mixed up together I added a small can of evaporated milk. The combination of the cloves and pepper was delicious. This was fast (I put the lentils carrots and onion all together at once then cooked the potatoes separately) and easy and already look forward to the leftovers.",

I also didn't have real potatoes so I ended up adding some potato flakes to thicken up the soup a bit. At the end I added a splash of balsamic vinegar. I would reccomend some parmesan cheese and maybe some spinach added to this but overall it was good. My husband and my 3 year old also liked it.",

I was out of onions but wanted to use the bag of lentils I had. (I couldn't imagine a good lentil soup recipe without onions!) As it turns out my husband had to go to the hardware store while I was cooking so he was nice enough to pick up some onions which were a wonderful addition. (I had planned on using onion powder for flavoring.) I will definately agree with the other reviews...it needed a lot more water. Just keep you eye on it and add as needed. I also added a bay leaf for seasoning and a shake of garam masala. I was a bit wary of adding mashed potatoes...but I used about 4 small red ones. It was great! I will definately make this again and again. YUM!",

The second time I did a better job of monitoring the progress and added water at times. It still turned out very thick (which was okay with us). I also omitted the celery and I think I may omit the carrot next time too. The taste of the soup when done (and not burned) was great!",
