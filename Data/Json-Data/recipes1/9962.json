In addition, to keep the rice grains separate like restaurant rice, add about 1 tsp. or so of oil to the rice and mix thoroughly with your hands.  Follow these two suggestions and there will be no clumpy rice.  I used brown rice cooked in chicken broth, which was so good I could have eaten just that alone.  Brown rice takes longer to cook than white rice, but is so much healthier (all the natural nutrition is removed when it is made white), and it tastes so much better.  This is a great basic recipe with lots of helpful tips from other reviewers.  Thanks for the recipe and the reviewer\u2019s contributions.",
