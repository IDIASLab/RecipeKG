According to experts on fine Maine cookery, the important steps to success in creating the perfect lobster stew are, first, this partial cooling before ever so gently adding the milk - a mere trickle at a time. The constant stirring until the stew blossoms a rich salmon color under your spoon and, finally, the aging, since every passing hour improves ins flavor. Some 'experts' even say two days. Overnight is good and 5 to 6 hours improves its flavor considerably. Be sure to reheat slowly.",
