He was skeptical when he saw me tossing in bottled green salsa and cornmeal but when he tasted it he couldn't believe it! I used low-sodium beef broth. For veggies I added in 1 cup each of diced celery and carrots. I also added some cilantro and made it slightly spicy with a medium-hot green salsa. I cooked it for only 40 minutes after adding in the meatballs. Any longer would have made the vegetables and rice too mushy. It heats up well the next day too. YUM!!!",

(Cabbage and cilantro should be added in last after the meatballs). I'm diabetic so I usually omit breadcrumbs rice and milk with no problems too. By the way...
