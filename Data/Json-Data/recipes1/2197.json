I made the recipe as it was written, using my Kitchenaid stand mixer.  The dry ingredients went in the mixing bowl and I stirred the wet ingredients in by hand.  After that I used the dough hook on \"2\" and the pouring shield to add the remaining flour until the dough no was a solid ball and did not stick to the sides or bottom.  I ended up using nearly all 4 1/2 cups of flour.   After baking and brushing with butter as directed I sprinkled with crushed sea salt - yum! It was a beautiful bread and was fairly easy to make.  I'll definitely make it again!",
