But my family loves it so I tried this recipe.\n\nIt is out of this world.  I used sage flavored sausage and dried thyme...also added a pinch of dried ginger as was suggested.  I did cut the onion and pepper down significantly...i used 1/4 c red banana pepper and 1/2 c finely chopped onion...don't skip the parsley at the end...it is a nice touch.\n\nI like the heat of the cayenne, but that is up to you.  I also substituted an envelope of McCormick Sausage Gravy mix for the flour.  Be prepared to add some extra milk.\n\nI served with homemade granola, fresh fruit and yogurt (made me feel better about serving the heart attack biscuits).  This is now in my brunch repertiore!",
