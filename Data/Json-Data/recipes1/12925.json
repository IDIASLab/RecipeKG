If your grocery store/sam's club/costco sells them, I would only use Campari tomatoes and they carry these all year long so you can enjoy this amazing \"summer-like\" dish even in January as I did!  I used 16 oz of spaghetti, 2.5 cups diced fresh tomatoes, 1/8 cup of olive oil, 5 small shallot (instead of onions) and 8 cloves of garlic.  I also increased the balsamic vinegar to 3 T (because we LOVE it!) and used a 1/2 cup of dry white wine in place of the chicken broth.  I added a pound of shrimp (which I cooked in this sauce as it simmered) because my husband doesn't feel pasta without some form of meat and seafood is truly a meal.  I think it would be just as good without the shrimp but the shrimp didn't detract from it at all.    Fresh Parmesan is a must for this recipe.  My 3.5 year old and my 21 month old DEVOURED this recipe!  4 thumbs up from us!!  DELISH!",

With the changes I made it came out more the way I like it.  I used 1/3 cup olive oil, 1/2 onion, 8 coves garlic, 5 cups chopped fresh roma tomatoes, 3 T balsamic vinegar, 4 cups broth, 2 T fresh basil, and added 1/2 cup cabernet sauvignon and some sea salt.  I think it could've used a little more wine and maybe a touch more sea salt.  The balsamic vinegar gives it a really good flavor.  It's a very light, fresh-tasing dish.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I followed the recipe, but I also took into consideration the other reviews.  As stated, the original recipe requires way too much pasta.  I completely omitted the chicken broth due to concerns of too much liquid.  Instead I used a bouillon cube and it easily dissolved in the juice released by the tomatoes.  I also added shrimp as suggested by the submitter of this recipe.  I don't think I needed the cheese really because this flavor really stands out on its own.",

The only change I made was that instead of using canned chicken broth I made my own using Better than Boullion. I made as a side dish for dinner but am looking forward to serving it with grilled shrimp or chicken soon for a main course. I will definitely make this recipe again and again!! I also found that this recipe is delicous served cold especially after allowing the flavors to \"marry\" overnight. I almost prefer it cold now as to serving it warm especially during warm summer evenings!",

This will def become a staple at our house.  I followed the recipe pretty much, except I didn't measure the onion (1/2 of a container of pre-diced), used a little more bottled minced garlic than called for, and used 2 cans of diced tomatoes (liquid drained).  Next time I will probably use a little less than a full can of chicken broth and  slightly less vinegar.  I might try adding some spinach for some extra nutrients.  Thanks!\nUPDATE:  I made using baby spinach leaves (let them wilt in simmering mixture towards the end of simmer time) and it was a great way to make the dish a little more nutrient-dense.  Thanks, again, for a great weeknight meal in under 10 minutes!",
