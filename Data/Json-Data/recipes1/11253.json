But the combination of porcini mushrooms (I used the dried mushrooms which I rehydrated) and fontina cheese is wonderful. I have made this 3 times already - added chopped freshly steamed asparagus the last two times. Fresh herbs like tarragon and thyme are also delicious on this pizza. Thanks for the great pizza idea!!!",

I will try the dough as instructed and see if I get better results. The toppings were good just the right amount of nutty cheese flavor and savory mushroom. We couldn't buy porcini and used another dried mushroom but felt the flavor was only slightly compromised with this selection. Because of the enormous amount of dough the one cup of cheese and small amount of ingredients left the pizza scantily covered. I will certainly be either reducing the dough in half or doubling my toppings next time.",
