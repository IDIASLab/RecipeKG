I made one change I could have sworn that I had fresh ginger in the fridge but I didn't. I used a teaspoon of ground ginger instead. Thanks for submitting this recipe it's delicious!",

I made 2 slight changes I used jarred chopped ginger and to use it up one fresh tomato. My husband did say the lime juice was a little strong for him although noone else agreed with him. I might reduce it to just 1t next time and omit the zest. Thanks for the recipe.",

I used cucumber and plain yoghurt as garnish; it worked very well. Basmati rice and pita (no naan in my very small town grocery) rounded it out. Family likes it; I'm allowed to put it on the rotating menu.:-) Forgot the lime still enjoyed it. One small quibble the recipe as written says nothing about the stewed tomatoes. I added them with the ketchup etc. and as far as I could tell it was fine. I may adjust it in the future for heat but solid as is.",
