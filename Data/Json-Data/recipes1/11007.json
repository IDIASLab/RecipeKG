Only cook pasta 1/2 the recommended cooking time on package.  It will not be done yet, but will finish softening up in crock pot.  Totally omitted butter.  Added 2 cans of chicken broth and 1 can of cream of chicken soup to crock pot along with other ingredients.  Cooked on low for 6 hours....DELICIOUS.  I also used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store unstead of boiling one.  Thanks for sharing this one...not your normal chicken spaghetti...has a great spicy kick and very colorful for a pot luck dinner.",

I also used grated cheese instead of cubed processed cheese.  With these changes everyone had thirds, and if I can get ALL my boys to agree on something you know it is a winner!!",

I used fresh mushroom and added red pepper flakes when I was sauteeing the vegtables for a little extra kick. I also subsituted mozzarella cheese for the processed cheese and the result was less creamy than I think it was intended to be. If you decide to do this, I would reduce the amount of pasta by 1/3. This was a great recipe that we will definately make again!",

This was a really good recipe...here are my slight changes (cheats):  Used a rotisserie chicken.  Used canned broth.  I followed others' suggestions and was sure to use ONLY 12 oz pasta, which was just right (whole box of 16oz would have been too much).  I also added additional chicken broth which kept this dish oh-so-gooey and moist.   How much extra chicken broth?  Just enough to make the mixture the consistency of pancake batter.   Oh and we like spicy, so I used the MEXICAN velveeta instead of the regular.  Delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe Stephanie!",

I ate 2 plates and I've only had 2 plates in one sitting one other time in the past 6 months of new recipes. The only thing I changed was I boiled 2 bone-in chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken (it was on sale so it was the cheapest way to go). 2 things, next time I'm inviting ppl over b/c it makes a ton! Also, if you have small children you may want to use regular diced tomatoes instead of Rotel. My b/f and I love hot stuff so we enjoyed it, but little kids may find it a little too hot. Thanks for the awesome recipe :)",

I also added more garlic onion Chili powder and salt & Pepper. But I'm sure this recipe stands just fine on its own. I did find the nacho cheese soup a great addition to this so I would highly recommend adding it again even if using the right tomatoes.",
