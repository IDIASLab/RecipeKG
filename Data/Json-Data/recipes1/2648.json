                "reviewBody": "I read all reviews before I decided to make this. It was simple, quick (you just stick everything in a blender), and really good. I added 14 oz. of coconut as that's what my frozen bag was and I read how people were adding more and figured why not, and 3 jumbo eggs. I baked it an hour. My husband liked it warm and it's good warm/cold, but if you want the firmer texture you need to leave it in the fridge. The only reason I can think of for any negative review of this recipe is people making the wrong recipe. If you want to invest a mere several minutes prep time, you should make this - it's excellent for what it is! - but if you want minimal work yet are expecting the outcome of a gourmet coconut pie you'd find in a restaurant.. it's common sense. I noticed one reviewer said it \"doesn't make its own crust.\" Again - if you are expecting to open the oven door and suddenly see a dough crust magically formed around the pie, you shouldn't be making this recipe. But if you're cool with a \"crust\" (a.k.a. firm, golden texture all around the pie that makes it totally non-stick and easy to lift out - I used a clear glass pie dish so I could see what the outside was doing, and when I ate it the edges were chewy) then this recipe is for you. The only thing I would add next time is a little salt, I think it will accent the flavor. Hope this is helpful to someone. :)\r\n",
