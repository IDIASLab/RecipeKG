I bake for 30-40 minutes though.  when knife inserted comes out clean.  Thanks Nancy",

The only change I make is to soak my raisins in boiling water for 10 mins or so so that they plump up and give all of their flavor in the dish. I also don't use nutmeg, because I don't like it. This is so quick and easy, it's perfect for unexpected guests! I usually serve it by itself, but sometimes I make a hard sauce to go with it.",
