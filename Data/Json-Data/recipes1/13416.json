I used a can of diced tomatoes (minus some of the juice)instead of just tomato juice and put the green pepper into the pasta instead of just on top and used a 4 cheese mix I had on hand instead of the mozzarella. Overall it was good but i think next time I'll used a little less pasta try it with mozzarella use less onion (and i love onion) and add mushrooms into the mix as well.",
