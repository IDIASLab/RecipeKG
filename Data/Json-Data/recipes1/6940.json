I add a tablespoon of minced garlic one juliened red bell pepper two hungarian peppers two jalepeno peppers and layer everything. They are so tasty to eat with the eggs and there is a mild or hot pepper piece in the jar depending on the persons taste. I also leave the pickle spice free as it has a nice look in the bottle with the minced garlic. I use a bulk sized valasic pickle jar like you can buy from walmart(got to eat the pickles first of course) and keep all of the quantities the same as the recipe calls for except I find that I can fit 18 eggs in the jar. You may need a tad bit more liquid but with the added ingrediants it shouldn't be to much.",
