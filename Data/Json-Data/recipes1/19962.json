I used light cream cheese light mayo reduced fat sour cream and light Cheddar cheese along with green onions smoked bacon and a handful of cherry tomatoes that I diced up. I let this set overnight to let the flavors blend together and served it topped with additional cheddar cheese and green onion on top! It went great with a variety of triscuit crackers cut up celery carrot sticks and chips! It was gone in no time at all.......",

I have to say that I ate enough of this great stuff too-- with Ruffles potato chips! As others did I also used green onion as it provided color as well as a little milder flavor than chopped regular onion would. I did cut back just a bit on the amount of onion called for as I knew that as it stood the flavor would become more intense. I know this will become a new favorite!",
