I made half with Panko and half with Italian breadcrumbs. There was no substantial difference between the two. It is a little challenging to turn them on the grill without knocking off the breading. if I have some advice here, it would be to get the grill plenty hot. I was cooking the steaks on the lower grill and most of the scallops on the upper grill. They looked soggy. The scallops all ended up on the bottom grill to get the breading browned nicely. As suggested before, pat the scallops dry between the water and the olive oil steps.",
