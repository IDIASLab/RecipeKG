A little garlic adds an interesting dimension. I use a whole bag of dried split peas (not pre-soaked), and after they are cooked and beginning to fall apart, I add another half bag. By the end of the slow cooking time (at least 2 hours; longer is better), the first batch of peas has disintegrated, and the second is soft, cooked, but retains their shape.\n\nTake it easy with the salt because the ham is usually very salty. UPDATE 2/6/20: HBH has discovered that there's quite a market for their hambones. So, they're now $10-15--about the price of a butt or shank ham in the grocery store. Oh well.",

Then removed the bone and any fat from the ham hock, added another 15 oz. can of chicken broth because it was too thick and some more pepper (didn't use any salt because the ham or ham hock has enough) and served with hot rolls!

                "reviewBody": "Split pea soup is a staple in our home (at least once in any 2 week cycle, especially during the winter) and this is a good \"core\" recipe for it. I generally use dried beans (usually 1 lb.), chicken bullion cubes (6-8) and just about any kind of pork, bacon, sausage or frankfurter (which I sautee in butter and with onions first) I have on hand. I usually cook the soup in my crock pot -- to which I add either (fresh or dried) parsley, oregano, basil, coriander; you know, whatever I like/whatever I feel like -- on \"low\", so that it REALLY slow cooks, adding carrots during the last hour (when I raise the temperature to \"high\"). I rarely include potatoes, but if/when I do, they are \"pre-cooked\" and added along with the carrots. Prior to serving, I emulsify at least PART of my \"batch\" (perhaps 1/3rd) in my blender and return it to \"the pot\". I serve it with a \"side salad and either a loaf of \"really heavy\" and \"crusted\" bread (an Italian loaf or a French \"bagette\" is good, but my family favors either Sour Dough or Pumpernickel) on the side, or refrigerated biscuits or homemade dumplings \"on top\". Cheese helps as a \"garnish\" here. While my personal preference is Parmesan, some of my family members prefer American while others prefer Swiss. I also put out a container of Sour Cream for anyone (such as myself) who wants to \"dollop\" it. A meal onto itself! And HEALTHY! \n\nNOTE to \"newbies\" (or to others who have never experienced the WONDER of Split Pea Soup): it is THICK. Especially \"t",

I also just pre-soak the peas and rinse them several times. I also use diced up ham chunks in the pre-packages and use a little chicken base to flavor just a little more... After I soak the peas I just throw them in the pot with all the ingredients and cool until it thickens.",
