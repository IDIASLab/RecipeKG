I did substitute beef broth for the water / bouillon and I left out the chilies otherwise I stayed true to the recipe. The Ro-Tel tomatoes brought the perfect amount of heat for us. This soup is very meaty and the black-eyed peas play a supporting role bringing a pleasant complexity to the flavor. If you really like them I think that you could easily add another can without overwhelming the soup. I made Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread to go with it. Tomorrow's leftovers will be with rice. I can hardly wait.",

Since it wasn't seasoned as sausage I added about 1/2 teaspoon sage and extra garlic salt. That's the only change I made and this stuff is wonderful! I'm serving with cornbread and can't wait until time to eat! Try this it is excellent!!! edited...Dinner is over and we enjoyed every bite! I'm almost afraid to try it with the sausage since the ground pork was so good! I will however try the sausage next time and report back.:)",

Daughter #1 who HATES and despises black eyed peas came in from work and ate two yes two bowls and pronounced it delicious. I did have about a cup more peas than the recipe calls for but hey it's soup right? Absolutely not too many. Wouldn't have a problem w/ more. In my opinion it needed much more time on the stove. 45 minutes is not enough time to mingle and marry the flavors. After tasting I felt it needed more kick. Now please understand that I do not like things too hot just spicy. I added extra salt and pepper and a gracious plenty (as Mama always said) of Frank's Original hot sauce. Practically perfect in every way. When I added a 14.5 oz can of tomatoes and chilies abovementioned daughter and I were practically dancing w/ joy. Now that I've reviewed original recipe I'm probably going back to the kitchen to add a few cans of other beans not and I repeat NOT because the soup needs it...just cuz I'm trying to add more vegs to my diet. I make lots of soups and freeze them in one serving bags to take to work for lunch. Very delicious healthy and frugal. I'm looking forward to having this one. Cornbread essential.",

Black-eyed peas are beans anyway so I can't imagine the taste would be that much different if I had used the black-eyed peas. This recipe is absolutely worth making.
