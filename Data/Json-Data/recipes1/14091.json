There wasn't a lot of flavor though and next time I think I will add some additional spice to give it a little more kick. Also some of my rice on the edges got crunchy. This may be because I didn't bake it in a loaf pan. If I do make again I will try a loaf pan to see if it helps. My husband and 14 month old both seemed to like it a lot and neither noticed the crunch rice.",
