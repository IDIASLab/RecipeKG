A couple of tips we have learned over the years: make sure to refrigerate the dough for an hour or two - this will make them easier to roll into balls. Using a little butter on your hands makes less of a mess as well. Be careful not to roll them too big because they will become very large after dipping and thus are just too sweet. Also after rolling freeze the balls overnight and dip them in the chocolate the next day taking a little at a time out of the freezer. We never store the finished bon bons in the refrigerator because they tend to \"sweat\" after you remove them. Delicious and addicting! If you follow these tips I promise that you will be hooked and make them year after year for the holidays!",

However I had to add extra powdered sugar and an awful lot of extra coconut (a little more than half of another 14 oz. bag) to get close to having a doughy enough consistency to form balls. The first batch still spread so much that I just refrigerated the whole mix and formed the balls AFTER the dough had been chilled for two hours. Also this makes a HUGE batch.",

Also a 1 inch ball is really big and I can see why some thought them too sweet or rich. Mine are a fraction smaller. Once rolled to desired size FREEZE the balls for dipping. Makes the process much easier. You don't want the chocolate too warm as it will coat the coconut balls thinly. A thicker coating is better tasting. Also these freeze wonderfully! They are delightful right from the freezer too! And yes the batch is quite large...perfect for sharing!",
