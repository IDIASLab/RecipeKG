I made a red batch (fruit punch flavor) and a green batch (can't remember the flavor) poured half of each into pans and swirled them together to create a marbled effect. Very easy and it tastes great. If you use Koolaid for your color and flavor use two packets; I made the first batch with one packet and the flavor wasn't strong enough. Edit to add: If you're having difficulties with the candy (ie. won't set up turned brown became bitter): these are temperature issues not recipe issues. Test your candy thermometer by filling a glass with crushed ice then filling with water then inserting your thermometer; it should read 32 degrees. If it doesn't make a note of the difference and use that to calculate how long to cook your candy.",

I make it every Christmas and sometimes at other holidays or for parties - keep your eye out for new extract flavors as I have yet to find one that's not good in this. Also try scoring the still warm candy (let it set up a few minutes so it's soft but not liquid) with a sharp pizza cutter (I use a kitchenaid one that has a really heavy blade). Scoring it first makes it easy to break into 'sticks' later - much easier to eat and safer for smaller folks to handle -- I make the sticks about 1/2 inch wide and 4-5\" long.",

I followed some of the advice here by omitting the coloring/flavoring and added instead 2 packs of unsweetened cherry Koolaid. Wow! The color is very bright with lots of flavor and turned out perfect! I didnt' have any trouble getting it out- I used a well-sprayed jelly roll pan and it broke into pieces easily. I wonder if those who had trouble did not get it to 310 degrees first... I know that took a long time but I'm sure that if it's not hot enough it becomes sticky and gooey and then will not break.",
