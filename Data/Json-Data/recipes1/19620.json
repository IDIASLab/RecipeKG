I used kosher salt and freshly ground pepper and subbed the tomato for chipotle bread & butter pickle since it's what I had on hand. I have been making burgers for years with these same ingredients but there is something special in here that makes these great. I made a comment while eating how good these were and my husband said, \"I was just going to say that\". The 3 minute time was was too rare for me but my husband liked them. I cooked mine a little longer. Maybe it was the special sauce, maybe it was the hotter pan than I usually use, but do try this. Thanks Chef John! These were fantastic.",
