I added whipped cream cheese to the blue cheese crumbles to make a creamy spreadable mixture. I'm not crazy about raw onions so I diced a large red onion and sauteed with diced bacon until the bacon was crisp then added balsamic vinegar and cooked down until reduced. That went on top of the toasted baguettes slices with spread. I topped with a slice of pear and chopped fresh thyme. These were so pretty and tasty. Definitely a do-over for sure. Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!",
