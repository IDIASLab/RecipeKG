I salted and peppered the chicken breasts, then spread them with mayonnaise to which I added fresh minced garlic.   I mixed panko bread crumbs and the grated Parmesan in a ratio of 2:1, and added fresh oregano, parsley and rosemary, topping each of the chicken breasts as the recipe directs.  I gave them a drizzle of  olive oil before popping them in the oven.  I much preferred that method and those fresh ingredients rather than mixing the cheese in with the mayonnaise and using Italian seasoned bread crumbs which I don\u2019t think I would have cared for.  I sliced the chicken and served it over \u201cSpinach Ranch Salad,\u201d also from this site, and \u201cBroccoli Cheese Soup V.\u201d",

I usually go an egg wash, but I thought I'd give the mayo a try just for old times sake and to see what my husband thought. I used more bread crumbs and added more seasoning to to them (parsley, oregano, basil, rosemary). I also opted to use Hellman's light mayo and light Parmesan cheese. I sprayed the bottom of the baking dish with Pam so nothing would stick and these came out moist and delicious - perfect with a side of twice baked potates and a salad.",
