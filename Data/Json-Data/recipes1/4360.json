The directions didn't specify whether the beating should be done by mixer or hand so I beat by hand which probably accounted for the homey coarse texture (which I prefer). I think this cake could be improved by a combination of spices as an earlier reviewer had suggested and I did cook it an additional 10 minutes - it looked a little jiggley although the knife came out clean. I had half a block of leftover cream cheese in the fridge so I beat that with the pineapple juice and then added the 10X sugar. I spooned that over the cake and topped with additional walnuts. I took the cake to work for a bake sale and had several comments on the beautiful appearance of the cake and 2 requests for the recipe. I will definitely make this again as I love Bundt cakes for their ease of frosting.",
