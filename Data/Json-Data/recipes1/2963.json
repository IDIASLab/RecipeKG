Everyone was asking what I did differently why was theirs all mushy and mine PERFECT! I was asked to make them for Christmas. This is the perfect and quick way to make Sweet Potato Casserole. I made this on Thanksgiving day before going to the party it is that quick!",

I chose it specifically because the potatoes were canned and there were no nuts (day care). I DID drain the potatoes and I think it's absolutely necessary since you add orange juice. The texture was pleasing (not all whipped up and soufle-like) and the kids AND adults enjoyed it. Very sweet (they ARE sweet potatoes) and I think I might decrease the marshmallows next time. Really really worked out well.",
