The basic ingredients of this recipe are fine but as the other reviewer noted this recipe needs the liquid to make it creamy. After following the recipe as written it didn't take too long to figure out I was in trouble. So I added about 2 cups of half&half mixed with about a 1/4C of cooking sherry and 2T of grated parmesan. It helped and we ate it anyway but the damage was already done. Try another recipe to make creamy chicken tetrazzini!",

I used a can of mushrooms instead of fresh. Two other problems with this recipe is the serving size no way does it feed ten three or four adults at most. The cook time was way off as well mine only needed to cook about 15 mins. uncovered. Despite all of that I loved this recipe! Maybe I should rate it low because of all the mistakes in the recipe but then no one will try it! If you follow my instructions it tastes great!",

I really liked how this turned out with a few changes. First like all the reviews have said it needs liquid. I went ahead and added a can of chicken broth to the pan. To make it a bit creamier I also added about 3/4 cup of sour cream and 1/4 cup 1/2 and 1/2. I feel like this made a pretty significant difference (along with ALOT more cheese). Also I was lazy and didn't want to saute the onion so I used dried onions and just added them...I'm sure it would have been better to follow the recipe in this regard but if you're in a rush it works. Next time I think I'll add a bit more flour b/c the sauce was a bit runny but I will def make this again.",
