                "reviewBody": "What an awesome recipe! This was the first key lime pie I've ever made, and it turned out fantastic! The second time I made it, I used fat-free sweetened condensed milk - big mistake - it was 'pasty.'  I also reduced the amount of lime juice to make the pie a little firmer, and wished I hadn't - it didn't have enough lime flavor.  The third time I made this, I reduced the butter by 1 Tbl., and used only 1/4 cup.  I liked that much better.  Don't be afraid to bake it the entire time, as that's what makes the filling firm and not runny. Note that this pie tastes much better the next day.  Also, I liked increasing the crust ingredients per Ina Garten's recipe on FoodNetwork to 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, and 6 Tbl. butter - makes a larger crust that is easier to work with, before and after baking.  Note that you will need approximately 15 key limes + 1 regular lime OR 8-10 regular limes for the required amount of juice.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!",

I didnt bother letting it cool in the freezer as long as the recipe suggested. I pulled the finished pie out of the oven let it cool for about 30min popped it in the freezer for 1hr then I topped it w/cool whip and placed it in the fridge and the texture/temp was just right!
