I prepared this recipe for dinner tonight and it was a hit just as written and prepared. I enjoyed the fact that the ingredients required were things that are pretty much staple in the kitchen nothing fancy expensive or hard to find. The ease of preparation and cooking were a family friendly combination that made this even more appealing. The ingredients combine to create an extremely tender juicy meatball with wonderful flavor that is accentuated by the sauce. I loved how the worcestshire sauce zested up the tomatoe soup it made a wonderful sauce. The rice was perfectly done inside the meatballs. As the contributor suggested I served with hot rice. It was a family pleasing hit. My picky 18 month old loved the meatballs which was something..she doesn't care for beef very much. However she loved these meatballs. My equally picky husband isn't much for anything different and even he loved these. I would strongly suggest that anyone try this. And of course because everyone has individual tastes and preferences you may want to may some adjustments but please give it a try just as it is first. Thanks Michelle for such a wonderful recipe. This will be a keeper for our family!",

The only difference, I think is that Mama used tomato sauce as opposed to the tomato soup called for in this recipe.  It really does make a big and better difference.  I'd also encourage you to make extra sauce in which to cook the meatballs. You can NEVER have enough sauce !",

Half had issues with the meatballs falling apart half didn't. I couldn't make up my mind to use the skillet or the oven so I decided to do what I usually do with my meatballs...the crockpot!:) Here's what I did\" The only change I made to the ingredients was I added and extra 1/4 cup of instant rice to make 1/2 cup (glad I did!). Everything else I kept the same. I first browned the meatballs in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes just like I do with my other recipe. Mine were pretty greasy so I was glad I did this otherwise the sauce would have ended up greasy too. While the meatballs were in the oven I poured the soups and Wor. sauce in the crockpot and mixed. I took the browned meatballs from the oven and gently placed them in the crockpot. I added just a couple of splashed of water to the sauce to make just a tad more to cover the meatballs. I cooked on low for 4 1/2 hours. Not a single one fell apart and they were deliciously moist and tender! I loved the sauce very tangy. My husband said it reminded him of a BBQ-type sauce. My 6-year old devoured his!! I served with mashed potatoes on the side. A definite keeper thanks for posting!",
