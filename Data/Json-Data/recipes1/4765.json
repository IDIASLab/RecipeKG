I thought two were plenty and I cooked them before adding it to the mix. I also wanted it to have more rice so it would be more filling. I added 1 cup of cooked brown rice and glad I did. I didn't use the salsa because I didn't have any and the Rotel is pretty much the same thing anyways. I ended up adding about a teaspoon of cumin and half teaspoon of cajun seasoning. The kids said it was a little spicy but they went back for seconds so it must not have been that spicy to them. I thought it was great! We have a family of four and this fed us all with a little bit left over. I couldn't think of what else to make with it for a side dish so just ate it alone.",
