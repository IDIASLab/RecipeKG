I quadrupled the recipe for a large office lunch, with a few cups left over to stash in the freezer.  I paired this with the World's Fastest Meatballs (also by Chef John), to make meatball subs. I also used this sauce with stuffed mushrooms and it was heaven.  I could drink this sauce!",

To 5 lbs of fresh roma tomatoes from our garden I added 2 large onions 2 large green peppers lots of fresh oregno and a small pile of garlic (along with generous olive oil of course)! Baked for 1hr 10 min then left it in the oven til all the heat was dissipated. I ended up with a delicious concentrated slurry to serve as a base for our marinara. I added 2 cans of tomato sauce and simmered. We added sweet Italian sausage cut in bite-size chunks (pre-fried) plus a lb or so of pre-fried ground beef (plenty of pepper a bit of salt). The idea of carmelizing these ingredients is genius!",
