In fact, when you buy the italian dressing packet, go for the zesty one.  As recommended, I lightly brushed olive oil on a hard roll and sprinkled with garlic powder before toasting (425 for 8 minutes).  Throw some creamy horseradish on the bun, chop up those pepperochini and toss them on the meat and top with provolone, and you've got a winner!",

However, this dish is one big WOW FACTOR! I kept taking fork fulls all night! I decided to use pork tenderloin with this and it was amazing. It literally melted in your mouth. I like a lot of liquid, so I used the juice from the peppers and used three cans of low sodium beef broth and only a half a packet of the seasoning. (didn't want it to be too salty) Also threw in a sliced onion plus my own seasonings. This is a winner Casey and I thank you for submitting it, but I'm begging you to give it a try with the pork.

Will definitely make it again but will use low sodium beef broth and much less salad dressing mix.  I'm assuming the salt content of the salad dressing mix and/or the olives in the pepperoncini might be the culprit.  Will check labels before I make again though.",
