Another bonus is that it is easy to make, and is yet another recipe for your slow cooker.",

Oven cooking gives it more of a \"candied\" apperarance, whereas the crock-pot version is more watery.  If you want to try it the oven way, just well-grease a 13 X 9 dish and bake at 350 for 90 minutes, stirring after every 30 minutes (or until it's as done as your family likes it. My husband prefers it a little dark.)  Don't be afraid to try this recipe; it's really easy and nearly everyone who tastes it, just loves it!   Good Luck!",

When I made it again last night, I cut the brown sugar down by at least half, increased the horseradish by 75% or so, and added Dijon mustard, barbecue sauce, Worchestire sauce, and a taste of tabasco sauce.  Mmmmmm, yummy!  It's delicious!  My coworkers all want the recipe.  I think another key is to make sure your kielbasa slices are nice and thin.  I didn't enjoy it as much the first time I made it when I sliced the sausage too thickly.",

Being a Polish girl, I never had kielbasa this way! lol  I read the reviews and grilled my kielbasa lightly on the BBQ so that fat would not drip into the crockpot.  (I love my kielbasa BBQ'd).  Then to my dismay, I discovered that my husband used the last of our horseradish!  I didn't want to substitute but I had to use horshradish sauce. Luckily, some other reviewers had done the same and said it turned out great.  Well, I have to agree.  The sauce was NOT liquidly or runny from too much fat...the horseradish sauce still gave it a nice zing without too much heat (even my six year old son loved it).  Just a delicious way to prepare kielbasa.  We always grill kielbasa for appetitizers at parties and I was thinking of even making the sauce and serving it on the side for dipping.  The combination of the smoked, garlicky kielbasa and the sweet/tangy sauce is sooooooooooooo good!  Thanks for a great recipe.",

I read all the previous reviews and decided to make the following adjustments - used only 2/3 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce sprinkle of dried mustard a few shakes of Worchestershire sauce and as directed 1/4 cup of horseradish. Yes you must slice the sausage very thin for the best results. I cooked on low for about 2 1/2 hours and it was wonderful. If I took this recipe to a pitch-in I would at least double it and probably triple it.",
