Not that the recipe title is necessarily inaccurate; long ago divinity was commonly called \"divinity fudge.\" The amount of water sounds waaay too little (I would guess an amount closer to 1 1/2 cups) and the instructions certainly neglect to mention that the syrup is added to egg whites that have been BEATEN to STIFF PEAKS (as in any recipe for divinity). So if you would like to achieve something like this recipe's intended result--theoretically at least--a nougaty white concoction studded with pecans (yum)--I would suggest searching for a twice cooked or no fail divinity recipe.",
