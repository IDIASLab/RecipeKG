Anyway I made this baked corn recipe along with a meat loaf (also a recipe from this site). The baked corn tasted great but I did make a change. After adding the two cups of corn I only had a little bit of corn left in the frozen bag so I dumped the rest of it in to eliminate any left over corn. I should have added more flour and milk but it still came out great. I finished the left overs the next day and it as just as good warmed up!",
