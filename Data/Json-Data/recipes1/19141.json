I preferred it without the Butterfingers frankly, as it was a little sweet, but Hubs said without them this is just plain chocolate cake. (What's wrong with THAT?) A homemade frosting in my view,Creamy Chocolate Frosting, also from this site, made all the difference in the world.  To have used the canned frosting directed in the recipe would have been a real deal breaker.",

First I applied a layer of milk and powdered sugar frosting to seal the cake and let that harden for a little while before frosting with the buttercream.
