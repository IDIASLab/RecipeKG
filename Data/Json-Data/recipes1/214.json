Tips: I make the cookie dough and place it onto waxed paper make into a log and put it in the fridge for one hour... then I roll it into tsp size balls by hand (do not flatten) place on a parchment lined cookie sheet and then chill again for a bit. Then I bake for about 15 minutes... until golden. I let them cool a little while on the cookie sheet then I transfer them to a rack to cool. The frosting is EVERYTHING on this cookie! Pipe the frosting on with a piping bag and a large tip. I also use 2 TBS. of butter in mine. Sprinkles are nice too! Make sure to let the cookies sit overnight after frosted to let them cool... the frosting hardens a bit and helps hold this very fragile cookie together. EGG NOG VERSION: add 1/4 tsp. fresh grated nutmeg to the dough and 1/4 tsp if rum flavoring and another 1/4 tsp. of fresh nutmeg to the icing. YUMS!",

While the taste was good the cookies fell apart easily. By the time I was done transferring the cookies to the cookie sheet most of them either broke apart or fell on the ground. Because of that issue alone I was unable to put the butter cream on the cookies so we sprinkled powder sugar on top instead. Otherwise they won't taste sweet at all. While I was not totally disappointed at the taste I don't think I will be making it again. I like my old one that has fewer ingredients and simpler steps.",

Add one teaspoon of corn syrup and I am told that will fix the problem. Cookies are not nearly as good without the icing but they do taste a like pecan sandies. I tried the cream cheese in the icing and that does add a nice flavor... UPDATE I made these cookies again last night and thought that I would roll the dough with flour on my hands and make them look nicer... what I got was a perfectly round cookie with a big dot of icing in the middle... The icing did harden but I left the cream cheese out and like it better with the extra flavor. The cookies tasted to floury also last night... They are definitely better if you go by the recipe and don't roll them into balls (I put a dent in the middle to hold the icing nice and neat but it works better if you just let them take their own shape!) I would suggest going by the original recipe (or adding pecans which makes them even more wonderful) and letting them cool before you put the icing on and don't make the icing to thin... I also made mine really dark green for Christmas but they look better a little more pastel colored...",
