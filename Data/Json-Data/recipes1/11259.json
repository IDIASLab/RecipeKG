It came out beautifully! :) Also gets 5 stars because I replaced with all whole-wheat flour and it still turned out great (few recipes do that as well as this one did!)   So, here's what I did: Used whole wheat flour instead of white flour. Doubled the peanut butter to 2/3 cup. And about halved the brown sugar (1/2 cup or less) plus 1/4 cup honey. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used regular milk.   Even with all those subs, it turned out AMAZING. I know some people don't like ratings with substitutions, but I love them because it helps me alter recipes to fit my whole-wheat-only diet. :-) I found other reviewer's information very helpful and am so excited about this recipe!!! Thank you for posting it here!!! It came out moist & delicious! :-)",
