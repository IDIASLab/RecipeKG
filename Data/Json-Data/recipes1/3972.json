I used two cans Italian style, diced and peeled tomatoes (undrained) in place of the Romas, and two jars of artichoke hearts because we love them.  I also added the liquid from both jars, but next time I will drain the second jar into the sink -- the sauce was just a little too \"marinade-y\".  I used slightly more garlic than called for, but other than that exactly as written.  Served over fresh cheese ravioli with sourdough bread on the side --- WONDERFUL!!!  And oh so simple!!",

I know that a bunch of other reviewers said that something was missing... try the fresh basil! And if you are using parmesan cheese from a can dump it out. There is no replacement for fresh parmesan (I spend the extra money for Reggiano Parmesan... it's the BEST and makes such a difference in recipes). Also the recipe calls for FRESH tomatoes. There is a time and place for canned tomatoes and this recipe is not the time nor the place. Quality ingredients are needed to make this dish. Took me a half an hour from start to finish.
