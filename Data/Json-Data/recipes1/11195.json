My friend puts her favorite cheese of the day on top last 5 min.  It melts down into potatoes and gives them a kick for cheese lovers.  I like cheese, but I love butter and potatoes all alone much more.  bon appetit, ciao for now!",

Honestly though, I didn't find they were all that different from similar recipes that used olive oil that I know have to be a whole lot less fattening.  I won't make them again for that reason alone.  I baked mine in the oven and added some Key West spice blend.

If we have real onion I will use that instead of the powder. We cover with foil and place on our grill. We bring a small propane grill when we camp. We cook for about 30-45 minutes. They are always a big hit.",

Toss the cubed potatoes (I leave the skins)in a light coating of corn starch to improve crisping add just enough olive oil to keep potatoes from sticking to your pan and season with paprika pepper and salt or garlic salt. Turn potatoes about every 8-10 minutes during 20-25 minutes in the oven.",
