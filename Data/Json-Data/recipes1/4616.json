(WW flour 1/4 c. applesauce to 1/4 margarine 1/3 c. brown sugar 1/2 c. Splenda 1/4 c. wheat germ and chopped walnuts.) Definitely not the most attractive cookie-cookie but oh so good out of the oven and difficult to spot that it's a better-for-you version. Husband came home snatched one up then another then another til I squawked \"hey dude it's almost dinnertime!\" to which our toddler remarked \"save cookie for me daaaaaddddy!\"",
