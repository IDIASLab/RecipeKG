We like a more hearty soup so we upped the ground beef to a pound and added a can of whole kernel corn. Also added an entire packet of mild taco seasoning. We'd definitely make this one again. It's great with crushed tortilla chips and melted Monterrey/Cheddar on top. A great recipe that you can customize to your own taste. We added some fresh cilantro as another review recommended - definitely will do that again.",

I used 93/7 ground turkey by Honeysuckle White 1lb half an onion about 1/2c a can of diced tomatoes can of pinto beans Taco Seasoning I (recipe from this site) instead of the package seasoning a 4oz. can of chopped green chilies 1c water and not the 1 1/2c that was suggested and Taco Flavored shredded cheese. I didn't use any avocado only because I didn't have any on hand. I bet that would have made it even better and I am not sure that is even possible. Thank You Darla for this great recipe. It will surely be put into rotation as one of our regular meals. oops almost forgot that also added a can of drained corn.",

I used ground turkey two medium yellow onions organic canned tomatoes organic canned kidney beans and organic tomato sauce. I made my own taco seasoning mix. To make this more filling and to add a little more flavor I did add in one can Mexi-corn rinsed and drained an additional can of organic black beans also rinsed and drained and a couple cloves of minced garlic. After tasting it I did add in more taco seasoning. This was okay--good enough for what I needed. I think it would have been better with broth instead of water but I was in a hurry.

I add about 3/4 cup of frozen corn too. I think the tortilla chips & sour cream really make the dish and the avocado really pulls it together! I sprinkle chopped green onions on top as well.",
