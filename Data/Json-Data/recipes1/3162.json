Cook the sugar mixture briskly, unstirred and undisturbed, for 10-15 minutes, until the temperature reached 255 degrees on a candy thermometer, or a drop of the mixture in cold water forms a firm almost brittle ball.  I found the 10-15 minutes, was just as important as the temperature.  Next, beat the second mixture for another 10 minutes or so (very important time), loses its gloss and is firm enough to hold its shape in a spoon. Stir in the nuts at once.  Great taste and texture.  Hope this helps.\r\n",

I don't know how anyone makes divinity by stopping the cooking at the \"mostly prescribed temperatures\" of 235, 250, 255, 260 & so forth.  If you've never been able to make divinity, join the club but try one more time & cook the sucker to 300 degrees.  I think you'll be happy.",

If you don't accept that fact...make something else. You have to be a good sport when attempting a divinity recipe! That being said... I love this recipe!!!!

                "reviewBody": "The first review, by TXLadyBug, was spot on. I followed the recipe as given by Kimberly, but I removed the syrup from the heat  at 255 to prevent it from overheating. I used an old trick from my coffee-slinging days to make sure the syrup poured in a slow, thin stream. Hold a tablespoon, concave side facing the eggwhites at about  a 45 degree angle, and pour the syrup over the back. This helps regulate the flow and makes it much  easier to keep the syrup from accidentally pouring on the mixer.  It is really important to pour the syrup in as thin a stream as possible to achieve a smooth, fluffy texture. I also recommend stopping after about 8 minutes of mixing to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. My heavy-duty mixer does not incorporate these areas well and after scraping them, I needed to mix for about 8 more minutes.  I would also like to note the humidity at the time, which was 20%.    I have watched my grandmother make divinity every Christmas since I was a toddler, and helped her to make it when I was older,  but had never made it myself. Sadly, this year will be my last Christmas with my grammy and she was sad that she is too ill to make the divinity, so I made it for her. She pronounced it exquisite and accused me of stealing her recipe :-)  Thank you for posting this recipe!",

I used one cup of pecans and one T less water b/c it is always humid where I live. I didn't have a candy thermometer so I used the cold water/soft ball test. When I dropped it in the water it formed a rope on the bottom of the glass that I was able to form into a squeezable ball. The syrup was also about to turn color.

Also I don't use a candy thermometer just test a bit of the syrup in ice water; if you can gather it up and it forms a hard ball that you can \"hear\" when you drop it on the counter it's ready.",

I couldn't call it really easy because it does require close attention to the directions. If you beat it too long after adding all the hot syrup and the vanilla it may become a very sticky gooey mess (as noted in reviews of other Divinity recipes here). I got mine into the pan in time but what remained in the bowl couldn't be budged without hot water. I'm just guessing that if I had beat it much longer and it had cooled any more it would have been very difficult to get into a pan.",
