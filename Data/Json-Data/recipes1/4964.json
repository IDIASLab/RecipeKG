Preperation takes about 20 mins but after that it is easy enough and tastes great! Thanks for the recipe Lois!",

I always double the sauce no matter what I'm cooking but I used Golden Mushroom and roasted garlic soups omitted the salt (soup has enough) added garlic and onion powders and used more curry then called for. I double breaded the chicken and placed them in the fridge for about thirty minutes so the crumbs would adhere better while frying. I also used my Fry Daddy to save on time. I too sauteed my mushrooms and then placed them on top of the casserole. Thanks so much Lois; I only wish there were leftovers!",

After 15 yrs. of marriage & countless chicken recipes my husband just declared this the \"best thing checken he's ever had.\" Here's what I did: DOUBLE the sauce. Beforehand saute fresh chopped mushrooms & onions in butter. Add this and extra garlic salt curry and white pepper to taste. After rolling & frying the chicken in the cheese & proscuittio place it over cooked angel hair in a 9x13 then cover with sauce. Cook at 300 for 45 minutes. Perfection!!! Trust me!!!!",

Used Italian style bread crumbs roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup & milk instead of wine. I let the chicken sit for about 1 hours after breading made for much easier time browning. I added enough sauce to the bottom of the pan to cover then baked for 1 hour (chicken was on the larger side). Last 5 mins uncovered and added 1 slice of cheese to each chicken. I tossed egg noodles with remaining sauced and then topped with the chicken. Will make again everyone enjoyed!",
