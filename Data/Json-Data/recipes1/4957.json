I only used 1 cup of rice because that's all I had but I added 1 cup of broccoli, some onion powder, garlic salt, and pepper and it turned out great.  Like other reviewers mentioned, this is a simple, semi-healthy meal that takes about 10 min to make and you can customize it to your tastes. A good recipe to keep on hand for nights when you just want to throw a few things in a pot.",

I had mushrooms languishing in the fridge that I needed to use up so I sauteed them with an onion in butter added water and cooked the rice in the same pan. Then I added the cream of chicken and canned chicken. I had a quarter of a bag of shredded cheese and my husband doesn't like things too creamy so I popped the mixture into a casserole dish topped it with a little cheese and baked it at 375 for about 20 minutes to crisp up the top. It received rave reviews at our table. I do think next time I will use cream of mushroom or maybe a mixture of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom.",

I saute' two boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I have cubed in a little olive oil, seasoned with garlic & onion powder and black pepper (no salt, there's plenty of that in the soup and stock). Instead of water to make the rice, I use Swanson's Chicken Stock (or broth) and I add a 4 0z can of chopped porta bella mushrooms. Still pretty easy, but adds a little more flavor and isn't as bland this way.",
