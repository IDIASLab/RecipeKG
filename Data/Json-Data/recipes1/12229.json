I mixed mine in the stand mixer and it comes into a ball just fine. You will need to chill it as directed or it is a little sticky to deal with. I made individual tarts because there were only 2 of us. I used Smuckers Seedless Red Raspberry Jam and it set up beautifully. This dessert is not overly sweet (yes!), so it was a perfect platform for a little chopped white chocolate (dark chocolate would also be great), but it is delicious as-is. I think this  is a great recipe for any fresh berry or fruit. Thanks!!",

(e.g. egg, vinegar, milk, water, etc.) I tried pressing the butter/flour/sugar into my tart pan, but it turned into a powdery mess. I added a few Tbsp.s of water, which helped a bit, but I still found the filling to be too tart for my family's tastes. Probably won't try this recipe again.",

After it was baked and cooled, I lined it with 4 oz. of cream cheese that had been mixed with powdered sugar and a little vanilla.
