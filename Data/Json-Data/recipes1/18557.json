I followed the recipe with the exception of not using marshmallow creme. I seem to always have marshmallows kicking around that need to be used up, so rather than buy a jar of creme, I used 12 large marshmallows. You can use mini mallows as well; 1.5 cups of mini's equal a 7 oz jar of creme. Curiously, my result was not bright white, even before mixing in the cookies - it was vanilla colored, maybe because of the marshmallows. Thanks for sharing the recipe, Lightedway! I foresee repeat requests for this next season :-)",

IT IS FUDGE. :) I reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 cups, and used a healthy 1 cup crushed chocolate cream Oreos IN it and probably 3/4 cup chocolate cream Oreos on top. I find the perfect fudge temperature is 238 degrees F (it boiled about 4 minutes for me). If you don't have a thermometer, it is so worth it. I used to deal with the \"soft ball\" stage thing, now I just stir and stir until it hits 238 and voila! This is my new favorite fudge!",

To me with just the 1/2 cup chopped in the mixture it doesnt seem like enough to me. or maybe I can just add more chooped and less topping. Either way it is all in how you like it.

Thankfully I cut back by 1/2 cup per a previous review but next time I will cut it back by a full cup of sugar (maybe more if it still makes a fudge). The Oreo amounts in my opinion are backwards too. I put the whole cup in to the fudge instead of on top and I think I would add more to suit my own tastes.
