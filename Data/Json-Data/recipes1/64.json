But the taste is pretty good and unlike some others I didn't have any consistency issues. My batch came out slightly sticky and held up great. I just double the recipe and weighed out 1 ounce pieces then made them into little \"snakes \" brought one end around and gave it 2 quick twists to hold it together. It may be difficult at first but just keep trying. It's a pretty forgiving dough. If your's came out dry try cutting back a 1/4 c on the flour or add 1-2 tbsp additional cream (I used whole milk with no problems).",
