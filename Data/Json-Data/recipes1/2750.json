There are a few things I would like to add to the directions: Melt the chocolate (at 50% power in the microwave) and add 1 1/2 Tbl. butter in pieces stirring to blend. Pour the chocolate into the bottom of a 9\" DEEP DISH pie crust and refrigerate. (If you want a more subtle chocolate taste I suggest cutting it to 1 cup choc 1T butter for a thin layer in the pie - I'll do this next time). Then in a bowl beat the sugar and butter first then add the other things pouring the corn syrup while you are mixing. Bake in a hot oven on a cookie sheet. I preferred having a soft layering of chocolate under the pecan layer which would be easy to slice hot or cool. Baking: after 50 minutes the crust was very brown but the center was not set so I had to cover it with foil. Then it cooked quickly. As far as taste: it was very rich very sweet and very good with vanilla ice cream! I can't complain about the richness or sweetness because what pecan pie isn't? It got the taste test award after Thanksgiving dinner! Artistic score: 5 stars So overall? 4 stars but now that I know what to do this will become a traditional pie for holidays worth 5 stars.",

A tad too sweet for my taste (I still enjoyed it) and my husband went nuts over it. He kept picking at it until I finally put it away! Next time I may cut back on the chocolate chips and add a little unsweetened cocoa powder. Between the sugar and corn syrup it's sweet enough. And my advice to anyone trying this for the first time...make your own crust! I used a store-bought refigerated pastry crust and was very disappointed. It was hard and dry. This pie needs a nice delicate flaky crust. But overall it was still very good and I will make it again...with a home-made crust!",

We ate it semi-warm and it was ok. The next day after the pie has chilled in the fridge all night it was delicious! Definitely make this a day ahead and chill it overnight before serving. The chocolate chips stay whole and do not melt but since it's a crunchy pecan pie you don't seem to notice. I also used 1 1/2 cups pecans... yum!",
