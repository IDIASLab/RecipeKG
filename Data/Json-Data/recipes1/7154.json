I used 4 garlic cloves instead of one, and I used diced tomatoes with green chiles. I only needed an hour and a half for the meat to become so tender that I almost didn't even need to shred it with forks. I served this on corn tortillas with all of the taco fixings. I love that this recipe only used a pound of meat, rather than the 3 or 4 pound roasts others use (with only two people eating, it makes it hard to finish what one of those recipes yields). This is so much better than ground beef!",
