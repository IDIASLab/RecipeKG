A slightly easier recipe (without buttermilk) for this would be to use a box of white or yellow cake mix, 2 eggs, and 1/2 cup of oil and add a couple  tsp. of root beer extract and use powdered sugar, milk, and extract for glaze with vanilla optional.

                "reviewBody": "Just ok - the flavor was good definitely identifiable as root beer and the fact this is a butter based cookie is noticeable as well. Other than that however I can't rave about these. The batter doesn't need the buttermilk at all so I left it out. I chilled the dough for well over an hour yet the cookies flattened more than I would have liked. The amount of \"glaze\" seemed like a lot and also seemed as though it would be too heavy too much like a frosting for this soft flat cookie. So I just mixed up a glaze with the ingredients without measuring until I came up with something of drizzling consistency. I'm glad I thought ahead and bought some candy root beer barrels which I crushed and sprinkled over the glazed cookies. These definitely needed the \"prettying up.\" This was a uniquely flavored cookie but I didn't care for the texture. My thinking is that there is too much butter.",

Somehow they reminded me of a gingersnap, but without the \"snap\" - I think it's the texture, which was fairly dense, and all of the brown sugar.  Definitely root-beer-y and a lot of fun.  The one quibble I have was with the \"glaze.\"  It tasted fine, but there's no way that anything with that much butter in it is going to act like a \"glaze.\"  Basically, it's root-beer-flavored powdered-sugar icing, and it acts like it.  It doesn't soak into the cookies; it just sits on top.  Tasty, but not quite what I was expecting.",

(and soften the butter by the way) save yourself from the extra work of beatig out root beer glumps. i also waited to add the frosting to the cookies until they'd cooled that way the frosting didn't melt off the cookie. overall they had a nice taste but they were a little too hard to handle.",

I also used Zatarain's root beer concentrate (usually used to make home made root beer soda) for the flavoring. The Zatarain's will give you a little more color in the cookie and glaze. (In fact the photo used here is way off the glaze should be a light tan at its darkest.) Have since used both the concentrate and regular root beer extract and I can say honestly that both of them work fine. My cookies were not flat at all they came out with a nice puff to them. The frosting is delicious and it is definitely a frosting not a glaze. Also wait until the cookies have cooled a bit BEFORE you frost them....they should be warm to the touch NOT hot out of the oven. Let them cool at least 5 minutes on a cooling rack. They should be the temperature that you would want to eat a cookie \"warm from the oven\". My daughter took a bunch of them to school and the kids loved them. Tasty and different cookie--will be making many more times. Watkins makes root beer extract as does McCormick.
