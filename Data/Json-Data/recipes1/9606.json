Then I mixed some feta cheese in with the peppers and stuffed the chicken. I added a little salt & pepper to the bread crumbs. Definately use olive oil instead of veg. oil and with the chicken thinned out you only need to cook it about 7 min. on each side. As for the sauce I added a little salt & pepper a dash of garlic powder and parmesan chs and simmered it for a couple of minutes and it was much better.",

I did not dare \"shake\" in breadcrumbs (would of fell apart) I just carefully \"rolled\" the chicken in them. I only used half of the crumbs called for. I had to use two toothpicks for each breast and then after browning they stayed together nicely. I choose to bake after browning(I poured sauce over all covered and baked for about 20 minutes) I did add some feta crumbles fresh minced garlic and a couple fresh spinach leaves to the chicken \"pocket\" along with the roasted peppers. Due to reviews I also added ground cayenne pepper and chili powder to the sour cream mixture. Loved the flavors of the roasted red pepper the sour cream sauce with the Feta (more than the chicken!) I will make this one again!",

I used partially thawed chicken breasts - this was much easier to handle and to slice. I sliced lengthwise and placed a small amount of the feta cheese inside then red peppers. I then placed in the fridge for 1/2 hour to defrost entirely. 2. I used buttermilk to coat the chicken (while held together with toothpicks). 3. I used panko bread crumbs seasoned with dried parsley oregano and garlic powder. 4. I browned slightly in pan in olive oil. Removed toothpicks. 5. I felt I had to bake in the oven because the chicken pieces were quite large. 350 degrees for 30 - 40 mins. Unfortunately I didn't have any roasted red peppers left to make the sauce. I used 1/8 cup of mild salsa with the sour cream. This was very good! I will definately serve this to visiting guests for dinner.",

Perhaps adding something to both the filling and the bread crumb coating would help (Maybe even the sauce?). Cooking it in vegetable oil on the stove isn't a great idea (I used olive oil). The coating got too brown- I suggest baking it in the oven. Also the cooking times given were too long. If I had cooked the chicken for 5 min then 10 min then another 5 on med-high heat it would have been severely overdone.",

When I made the sauce I used reduced fat Feta and reduced fat Sour cream. I added a little garlic powder and a dash of cayenne pepper to it too so that jazzed it up a bit. Then I baked it in the oven for 20 minutes or so at 350 with the sauce on it.
