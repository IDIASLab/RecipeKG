I used honey and apple juice as well. I multiplied this recipe x8 and it called for 3 cups of sugar or sugar substitute. With a regular jam recipe it calls for 7 or 8 cups of sugar. So not sure if I could call this recipe low sugar but at least you can use honey instead of granulated sugar so it's still so much better. Will make this again!",

The level of sweetness was just right, and since low-sugar pectin is used the huge amount of sugar one normally uses in making jam isn't needed for preservation.  (I used water instead of fruit juice and the 1/2 cup sugar).  \n\nAs one other reviewer mentioned, the consistency inside the processed jars seemed to be more like thin syrup at first, but about three to four hours after pulling them out of the water bath they had thickened up to a perfect consistency.  I highly recommend this recipe!",

I boiled the recipe for 10 minutes, and I skimmed off all the foam after removing from stove, otherwise the fruit will fall to the bottom.  And last , I returned the full jars with lids back into a bath of water, covering the jars for 10 minutes.  This will seal the jam and you will hear the lids pop as they concave.  Otherwise you will need to use paraffin wax.  This way your jam stores for a year without spoiling.  I hope this helps some of you, because I have made many mistakes in the past, like having to recook the jam, the fruit falling to the bottom of the jar and so, it's with tips like this you will save extra work .  Once I had had some friends try it, I will let you know how they liked it.  Oh and I used Cranberry  concentrate for the liquid.",
