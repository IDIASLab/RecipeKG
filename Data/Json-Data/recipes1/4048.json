I had to do some research on what Hard Dry Cider and I found out is something like an apple wine, the \"Hard\" is a way of saying that it is an alcoholic drink so since I did not have any of that I used a dry white wine and did not change the amount.  This is what I will do different next time...use a different wine and cut down the amount, cook the pasta only 7 minutes and then add the shrimp and let it cook.  Reason why is because the pasta was over cooked at 15 minutes and the extra cooking time for the shrimp just added to the over cooking.  My husband like it so I will fix it again with these changes.\n\nThanks",
