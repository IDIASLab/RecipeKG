Salt regulates yeast activity and strengthens dough structure.  Too little salt can cause the dough to rise rapidly and then fall. I've seen that for 2 1/4 tsp (.25 oz) of bread machine yeast, the general salt amount is 1.5 tsp. I made this recipe with the extra salt and it turned out really well.  It is the best loaf of white bread I've gotten from my machine so far -- and it rose really high (it had me slightly concerned it might over rise).  But it was a beautiful loaf in the end.",

On my 2nd loaf, however, I made a few changes:  I used 3 Tablespoons sugar and reduced the yeast to 2 teaspoons instead of the 2 1/4 teaspoon measurement that is in the 1 packet that it calls for.  This reduced the rising just enough so that the slices near the top of the loaf weren't as \"airy\" thus, held up better during slicing.  Also, instead of using 3 cups of white flour, I substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and  2 1/2 cups of white, and the result was a lovely, soft, very light white/wheat bread with a flaky crust, perfect for sandwiches!

                "reviewBody": "The basic recipe is good but has some issues:\r\n\r\n1) \"Bread Machine Yeast\" is just another name (purely for marketing) for \"Instant Dry Yeast\" (IDY) which is INSTANT and therefore does not require pre-proofing in water. Simply add it to your dry ingredients and continue without the \"dissolve and foam\" step noted. There, you've save 10 minutes!\r\n\r\n2) Active Dry Yeast is not Bread Machine/Instant Dry Yeast and it *does* like to be pre proofed as noted in the original recipe. \r\n\r\nActive Dry yeast is in little round beads about the size of a pin head. Instant yeast is very small and more like little threads of yeast, much smaller than Active. You would need about 25% more Active yeast than Instant. \r\n\r\n3) Salt:\r\n\r\nSalt is normally 2% of a recipe's flour amount. Here we have 410g of flour (check the metric version) so we want 8 grams of salt, or about 1 1/2 teaspoon. The recipe as given is therefore missing 33% of the required salt which is more than just a \"taste\" problem.\r\n\r\nSalt will not only improve the taste of your bread (this or any other) but is needed to help the gluten's strength by tightening the gluten strands a little. Bread with too little salt will not only taste bland, it will also be too soft. \r\n\r\nTry this experiment: \r\n\r\nMake this recipe with the correct 1-1/2 tsp (8 grams) of salt then again without salt and compare the two for taste and structure. You can use the saltless loaf for breadcrumbs or feed the birds afterwards.",

                "reviewBody": "This is an excellent starter recipe.  I make a few alterations though, as my family likes whole wheat...  Here's my exact recipe.  This makes a 2-lb loaf.\n\n1-1/3 cups warm water (about 115\u00b0)\n3.5 tsp bread machine yeast\n1/4 cup sugar\n1/3 cup oil\n2 cups bread flour (essential to be bread flour!)\n2 cups whole wheat flour\n2 tbls gluten (or 1 tbls per cup of ww flour)\n2 tsp salt\n1/4 cup dry milk powder (makes the crust flaky)\n\nFollow the directions in the original recipe. I like to bake mine inthe oven however.  I find that the dough cycle is actually too long on my machine if you use bread machine yeast (1.5 hours), because the end of it is a rise cycle, which I want done in my bread pan.  The reason for this is that bread machine yeast actually cuts out the need for a second rise.  So, after the final pulse cycle (you'll have to pay attention to your machine to see when this is -- mine is at 50 minutes into the dough cycle), take it out, shape it into your loaf and place it your pan to rise for 30 minutes.  Then, bake it at 350\u00b0 for about 25 minutes.  Bread should be brown on top, not just golden.\n\nLet the loaf cool completely before cutting!  I also like to smear the crust with butter to keep it soft, but if you like really crusty crust, then don't do that.\n\nI've tried many recipes, and this is by far the best basic bread recipe I've found. It's perfect for sandwiches, french toast, or anything else you'd use store-bought bread for.",
