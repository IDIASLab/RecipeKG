I ended up keeping them in the crock pot on low for 8 hours because I didn't read ahead and planned on making it while I was at work. There was the perfect blend of sweet from the brown sugar and sour from the vinegar. I was a bit worried about the lima beans but they ended up turning out as a creamy delicious bean. I paired it with coleslaw and hot dogs and the guys loved it. These will definitely be made again in our house! Thanks for sharing!",
