Everyone declared it a hit, and hubby said it was the star of the meal. Made this exactly per the video instructions, and will do it again next year. I assembled it the day before, brought it up to room temp. while the turkey baked, then added the topping and popped it into the oven while the bird was resting. Gluten free Panko crumbs worked perfectly. Do use good quality Parmigiana-Reggiano cheese, it matters in this recipe.  Kudos to Chef John for updating a very tired classic. Thank you!",

                "reviewBody": "Made this for Thanksgiving.  Loved Chef John's video tutorial.  \"2 Large yellow onions\" was hard to judge for me.  Here in TX we grow 'em BIG.  I ended up using 2 pans to caramelize the plethora of onions.  Still, I used them all in the dish, when one of those biggies would have sufficed.  I used 1% milk and slightly less flour (my hand guesstimate was off).  It didn't thicken quite as much as I thought it would.  This could be due to my flour mismanagement or the 1% milk.  It worked fine in the dish, it just didn't give that soupy-creamy texture that is found when making the recipe using soup from a can.  Also, didn't have sherry vinegar so just used sherry on the onions.  Mmmm.  The Panko and Parm-Reggi was delightfully tasty.  The Gruyere added a nice bite and depth.  However, that cheese is really pricey.  I may make it with a less expensive brand next time.  The flavor of this dish was as wonderful as I thought it would be.  What with all the chopping of my BIG onions and the green beans, the caramelizing and sauce cooking, and cheese shredding, this recipe is a bit time consuming and labor intensive.  But the end result is elegant, tasty and gave me pride that I didn't do the soup version of this classic casserole.  Thanks Chef John!",

                "reviewBody": "If you are wanting a more decadent green bean casserole other than the regular boring soup kind, this is it!  This is one of my favorites now!  I pretty much went exactly by the recipe except I flavored the white sauce with a little onion and garlic powders and used canned green beans instead of fresh.  I was making a big turkey dinner with this, so I prepared it all the day before.  I assembled it all together except the topping and refrigerated it.  Once I was ready to cook I pulled it out of the refrigerator and topped it with the topping and put in the oven.  It was great!  It turned out nice and creamy and full of flavor!  With the caramelized onions in this, you won't miss those crunchy ones that are normally on top.  But Im sure you could still add those and it would give it another depth of flavor if you love them like I do.  The gruyere cheese is expensive and honestly if you go with a cheaper swiss or even a gouda cheese, it would taste just as good.  So don't get scared away with an expensive cheese because it will still be great with something cheaper!  Thanks Chef John for this delicious casserole!  I will be definitely making again!",

This version is way better and my taste buds were pleased! Yes--the cheese is pricey (I paid $4.99 for 4 oz) but it marries all the ingredients together perfectly -- savory and sweet. I didn't have access to fresh green beans and used 2 lbs of frozen -- I cooked them 2 minutes less than the package specified to avoid them getting mushy. I also don't keep milk in the house and substituted half-half. Of course, more calories and fat but the sauce was rich and creamy; I used rice flour to make the roux -- 4 tbsp. For the top, I used Kinnikinnick gluten free panko bread crumbs. This recipe is definitely a keeper in my household!",

My whole family loved it, even the people who don't normally like green beans. I used cheddar cheese instead of Gruyere cheese because that is what we had on hand. I also didn't add any cayenne pepper or thyme(because we didn't have any on hand). The video really helped me to know how long to cook the onions, since I've never done it before.\nOverall I love it.",
