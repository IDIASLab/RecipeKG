Followed the recipe to the letter - even using shredded cheddar cheese ~ which is something I don't use too often in soups b/c it tends to give soups a gritty texture instead of a creamy texture.  Next time, I think I'll ditch the cheddar and use some velveeta instead but it was still very good and this recipe proves that soups containing only veggies are still very tasty!! Thanks Jackie!!",

I also added galic to the soup instead of the bread crumbs. I substituded milk instead of half and half. I'm not sure, but I think half and half would have made it REALLY thick.

We also used a cup of shredded cheddar and a 1/2 block of velvetta since the other readers suggested it.  My husband said that this is the best soup that he ever ate.  Restaurant quality!  We'll definitely make it again.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.",
