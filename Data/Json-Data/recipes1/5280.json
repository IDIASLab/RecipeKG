I marinated the chicken for 4 hours. Then I baked it in a 425 oven for 45 minutes in the marinade (per another reviewer)...I didn't bother to baste it...it turns a beautiful golden brown. I removed the ginger before baking. Also, instead of crushing the garlic, I diced it up really small...yum! One thing I will do next time is put foil in the pan that I'm baking in...makes cleanup much easier. This is very moist and tender.",

                "reviewBody": "This had a subtle nicely balanced flavor but only after I fiddled with the marinade a bit. First I used about half the amount of soy sauce called for. I know how it can permeate delicately flavored chicken and it could potentially have made it too salty as well. Half the amount was the right amount. Second the type of sesame oil was not specified and it should be. Does the submitter intend the light cold-pressed sesame oil used for salads and for frying? Or did she intend the boldly flavored toasted\" sesame oil used for flavor usually not more than a dribble in ANY dish? I just used my own judgment using the light sesame oil for the most part and just a little of the rich brown toasted sesame oil for its wonderful flavor. Ginger root is not something I use often so I rarely buy it (and I'm not terribly fond of it anyway). A light pinch of ground ginger sufficed. The honey was a nice addition giving the chicken a beautiful glazed appearance once it came off the grill. The chicken was tender and moist but I credit Hubs' expertise with grilling for that! Served with Classic Fried Rice and Easy Bok Choy this was a delicious darned near memorable meal and beautiful in its presentation. (Note: I didn't see heating the marinade ingredients as necessary so I didn't bother with that step. I just used the easier more common method of just dumping everything into a Ziploc bag. I marinated the chicken as the submitter recommended about 15 minutes)",
