                "reviewBody": "I don't want to be rude, but if this recipe turns out as anything other than a perfect basic chocolate pudding, it is entirely your fault. If you have egg bits: you put the egg in too much at a time and the temperature difference between the eggs and mixture was too high. Temper the eggs first or they will cook instantly when you put them in. Corn starch bits: you added the corn starch too late and the mixture was too hot. Mix the corn starch in thoroughly with the first cup of milk until it's dissolved. Liquid consistency after chilling: you didn't stir it enough while it was cooking. Stir it more until it becomes thick in the pan. Chocolate didn't melt: you cooked it too hot and the chocolate was too thick. Break it into smaller pieces, shave it, or cook the pudding on a lower heat for a longer period of time. Gritty or otherwise imperfect texture: you didn't use a whisk. Use a whisk. Remember that the pudding is only as good as the ingredients you put in it, so if you want it to turn out awesomely, splurge a bit and get some GOOD chocolate. Furthermore, it's a recipe that will take some tweaking before you get it exactly to your tastes. Don't make it once, trash it, and blame it on the recipe; make it twice, three, four times and change it each time until you get it. This is a pudding worth mastering.",

I would add a few steps to the instructions.  1)Destroy every lump in the powder mix or risk lumpy pudding. 2)Grate the chocolate.  It melted at the same moment the mixture boiled. 3) Stir a few spoonfuls of heated cream/chocolate mixture into the egg yolks to warm them up BEFORE putting the egg yolks into the pot.",

As an aside, for those having trouble adding in the egg: beat the yolks in a bowl and add a tiny bit of the hot pudding in, mix it up and add a little more. Then you can add the yolks into the pudding and they won't 'scramble'. Seperate the yolks carefully as well or you'll get bits of cooked egg white in your pudding. Overall a good, old-fashioned pudding recipe with wonderful texture and flavour.",

However, the cooking method here is asking for trouble - like cooked bits of eggs to be specific!  (If that happens you might still be able to salvage it by sieving it) Do NOT stir the egg yolks into the hot mixture!   Rather,  stir about a half cup of the hot mixture into the yolks to temper them, then return the egg mixture to the saucepan to finish cooking.  Finally, whether you leave this in one serving bowl or pour into individual serving dishes, cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming.  Note: For a vanilla variation eliminate the chocolate and reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup.",

I thought it was a bit too sweet and the sweetness overpowered the more complex deep chocolate flavor that I was really hoping for. Next time I will use 3/4 cup sugar. Also I used Ghiradelli unsweetened chocolate and I found that I was left with little dark flecks of chocolate throughout the pudding that hadn't melted completely despite the fact that I cooked at a lower heat for a longer period of time to try to avoid this. I don't think this had any impact on the flavor because the pieces were so tiny but next time I will melt the chocolate before adding it in. The little chocolatey spots definitely show that the pudding is homemade though so if they don't bother you just follow the recipe as is and go for it! Although the recipe doesn't mention it make sure you temper your egg yolks before adding them in. (Add a little of the chocolate mixture to the yolks first and whisk to bring up the temperature then pour in to the main mixture and whisk.) Failing to do this will leave you with little chocolatey scrambled eggs! Also I would suggest using a whisk for the entire cooking process to ensure a lump-free pudding. All in all very tasty!",
