I'd also recommend adding the almond extract to the yolks before the nuts go in just easier to mix in. Be sure to serve with some whipped cream & save a few ground almonds to sprinkle on top!",

It's not a recipe that would be high on my list but that might be because of some changes I made. I used only 1.5 cups of finely crushed PECANS and used VANILLA flavoring. The big difference came I think from the size pan used. I used a 9x13 which resulted in a thinner bar that required less time to bake (only 35-40 min). Mine didn't look anything like the picture but it was okay. The topping was like of a lacy crunchy texture while the inside of the bar reminded me of pecan pie. I liked the fact that it wasn't overly sweet. Also if you're counting Weight Watcher points I figured out that if you cut the recipe into 12 servings it's 5 points per serving. Again it's an okay recipe but it may be quite a while before I make it again.",

The bars came out chewy and delicious. My only criticism is that despite the recipe only having 4 ingredients it takes a long time to prepare and cook.
