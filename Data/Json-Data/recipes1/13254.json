I doubled the crab for a meatier dip and added several tablesppons of Old Bay (I love that stuff!) to the mix. I also added a few tablespoons of lemon juice and a little extra cocktail sauce. I used a prepared creamy horseradish spead as that's what I had on hand and it worked very nicely. Instead of almonds (store was OUT?) I sprinkled Old Bay on top. I baked for about 50 minutes since my dip came out of the fridge and I doubled the recipe. Very nice this will be a great go-to for football season and the holidays. Sincere thanks for sharing!",
