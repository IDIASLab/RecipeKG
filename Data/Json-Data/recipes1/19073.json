        "description": "I was frantically searching for a non-coconut recipe for Irish Potatoes for St. Patrick's day. I recently became allergic to coconut, so I made this recipe up after not being able to find an alternative online or in any cookbooks I have at home. I think the almonds are a nice twist and help maintain the consistency of the ball instead of just omitting coconut from other recipes I've seen. This is a good no-bake recipe. It is simple to make and easy to eat.",
