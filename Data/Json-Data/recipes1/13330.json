I would suggest using the white cream bread that is really square if you can find it at asian markets. It is a little more dense than regular white bread. Also I fried them upside down so the shrimp would cook. I had no problem of the paste coming off.. My friend's kids devoured them! I wouldn't suggest having the kids make them though because of frying the oil but they will love them. Adding this to the review... use soy sauce/Chinese-Colman's mustard mixture for dipping sauce or chili sauce/soy sauce mixture for dipping. Delicious!",
