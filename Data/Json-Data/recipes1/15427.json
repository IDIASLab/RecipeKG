Each time I have used Texas Toast as I could not source the Mexican Bolillio Rolls. I find that if you don\u2019t over saturate your bread in batter (to a point of sogginess) and that if your skillet or griddle is hot enough, the mascarpone filling should not melt as it takes the toast less than a minute (about 45 seconds)  to brown on each side. This is a recipe that one should definitely try more than once--making adjustments according to one\u2019s taste; i.e. with different fruit, etc. Also to those who cannot locate Mascarpone cheese or the cheese is too expensive etc., I have found an awesome substitute for Mascarpone cheese that is as good as, if not better, than the real thing.  Enjoy!  Mascarpone Cheese Substitute: 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese  1/4 cup heavy whipping cream  2 1/2 tablespoons sour cream  Combine well. Do not substitute low fat cream cheese or sour cream.",

The only changes I made were: I used french bread instead of bollio and I added regular sugar to the mascarpone in addition to the powdered because I didn't think the confectioners cut it. Also since it wasn't peach season U used frozen peaches and it still came out really well. I'd recommend this recipe to anyone! UPDATE: I just wanted to share a much easier way of making this. Forget the loaf and cutting and stuffing! Just buy a presliced loaf of french sandwich bread and spread the filling between two slices and make as normal. So much easier and I say even better!",

My husband stated that he much preferred this breakfast to anything else we've had before because it's not overtly syrupy sweet like so many other french toast/pancake recipes. The only changes I made was using canned peaches as this was a last minute recipe and I didn't have fresh. Since the canned peaches were already sweeter than fresh I did not add the granulated sugar but just left in a little bit of the light syrup it came in and then seasoned according to the recipe. I also used plain bread slices as I've never even seen Mexican Bolillo Rolls in my small northern town. I will definitely be using this recipe again in the future. Thanks so much!",

                "reviewBody": "My favorite allrecipes.com recipe! Absolutely fantastic. I've made this several times and with different breads. Of French bolillo rolls blue berry crepes and sub rolls the bolillo rolls were the easiest to work with and the fluffiest. I found them in the bakery bread section of the grocery store near the buns and dinner rolls. The texture of the French bread made it difficult to stuff without tearing. The fresh lemon zest makes this dish. The peaches were excellent and I've also modified it with fresh blue berries and fresh black berries. Easy to make & decadent this is our 'go to' recipe for special occasions and company. Highly recommend. Revised 01/01/16 - Here's what I've learned.... Wheat Bolillo rolls work great with a mixed berry compote in lieu of peaches if desired. The slight bitterness of the bread is offset by the sweetness of the berries. The recipe as presented will easily make (6) rolls which will easily feed 6-8 people especially when served along side sausage (highly recommend). I've found if you cut the pointed ends off first then alternate slice cuts as follows it's an easy dish to make: Main slice through half way slice main slice through. Much less work than making slits for pockets. Each individual serving piece then ends up about 1 inch wide. The cheese mixture can then be spread by knife onto the roll in between the two sides (instead of piped) dipped by hand into the egg wash and placed on griddle. The half way cut keeps the",

While they all said they enjoyed it and that it was good... I was a little less impressed. Used the bread suggested and I don't know just seemed to much bread to filling ratio. I will make again but making a few changes. Probably will try Texas toast and making a sandwich version before frying in a pan. Peach topping was very good and could see other toppings being just as good.",
