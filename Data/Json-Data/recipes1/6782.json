My cookie sheets don't have a non-stick coating, so I used parchment paper which worked well.  Smaller pieces were dried after 4 hours and larger pieces were done by 7.5 hours.  Be sure to check on these every 30-45 min. towards the end and remove them when they are still leather-like and pliable.  If they lose their deep red color and get crispy, they have dried too long.  I plan to freeze the extras: some just as they are and others in a plastic zip bag with a small amount of olive oil to use later.  Be sure to use only good tomatoes...I tried drying some that were past their prime (a little mushy inside) and they were not worth keeping.",

Sprinkle 3/4 cup of these on and maybe some grated Parmesan, and roll up, jellyroll style. Cut with dental floss. Place in a baking pan, sprinkle with Parmesan, and cook at 350 for 20 minutes.",

I had them in the oven about 6 hours and they seemed way to dry! Most were as \"crisp as chips.\" I found out that a smaller tomato is not best for this and that romas were a drier tomato. Use a good plump tomato and this recipe should work good. Don't assume it will take all day! Check them after 4 hours or so and about every hour. I am currently rehydrating them in some boiling water to see which ones are salvageable. The recipe does not say how to store them, if in the fridge than how? Do I put them in a bag or in a jar with olive oil with or without seasonings. It also does not suggest on how to rehydrate them for future recipes or if that is even neccessary. I also wish I knew what to look for so that they didn't get so hard and dry, which is the most important thing. The directions just said this could take all day so I didn't bother them. I will probably store them in olive oil in the fridge now that I am in the process of having to rehydrate. I may try them again with a more plump tomato, check on them to make sure the center stays softer, and then store in the freezer as suggested by others. I really wished this would have worked perfectly. Maybe, I just needed more detailed instructions my first time. It would have helped.",
