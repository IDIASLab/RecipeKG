                "reviewBody": "Superb texture and flavor! The tang imparted by the\r\nyogurt is the perfect foil for the spices. I've made\r\nthis twice now. As written, it needed a bit of\r\ntweaking. So this time, which was far more successful\r\nthan when I followed the recipe verbatim, I added 1/2\r\ntsp baking powder to lighten it, 1-1/2 tsp cinnamon,\r\n1/2 tsp freshly ground nutmeg, 1 tsp allspice, 3/4 tsp\r\nground cloves, 1/4 tsp mace, as flavor was a bit pale\r\nthe first time. Baked it in a greased and floured\r\nbundt pan for one hour at 350. Also, I\r\nagree with previous poster not to \"beat for 2 minutes\"\r\nafter adding the flour. This will encourage excessive\r\ngluten development, which will result in a tough\r\nproduct. All the beating should be in the creaming\r\nprocess, with the sugar/butter/egg mixture. After\r\nthat, once dry ingredients have been added, only a\r\nminimum of gentle mixing (on the lowest speed) is\r\nnecessary, only to incorporate the dry ingredients\r\nfully. If you follow these steps, your pound cake will\r\nbe dense yet tender, with a crumb that's moist yet\r\nfully baked. The aroma as it bakes is delightful, and\r\nthe cake is irresistible. Finished with a glaze made\r\nfrom 1Tb soft butter, 1-1/2 cup powdered sugar, and 1\r\nTb milk drizzled on the warm cake. No trouble removing\r\nfrom the generously greased and floured pan, when done\r\n15 minutes after removal from the oven. A recipe to be\r\nhanded down to following generations in your family -\r\nit's that good!",

I bumped up the leavening to 1 tsp each of baking powder and backing soda.  I also increased the level of spices.  \nTo add a fruity fall flavor, I sliced 5 small tart apples and mixed them with a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and brown sugar.  I heavily lined the bottom of two loaf pans with the apples and poured the batter on top.  This turned out amazing!!!!!!!  Bake for 45-50 min and then let sit in the oven while it cools to prevent the cake from falling.\nThis tastes great alone, or served warm with whipped cream or light vanilla ice cream, what a great low fat treat!",

My advice: DON'T try it in a bundt pan as it ends up \"falling\" after it comes out of the oven giving it poor presentation value! Follow the recipe and use a 9x13. Finally if you want to avoid producing too much gluten in the flour (a tough/chewy end product) beat the sugar/eggs/butter on high for 3-5 minutes then add the remaining ingredients and mix only until blended.",

At first I didn't want to tamper with this recipe since it was getting such good reviews but my phobia won over and I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I did what another member suggested and did not beat in the dry ingredients. This may have resulted in the lightness and fluffiness of my cake. I baked it for about 35 minutes and ate almost 1/4 of it right after I took it out of the oven. It was absolutely delicious! Moist and not to sweet. Maybe next time I'll try adding more sugar and more spices (only because I'm a spice person the recipe is indeed very good as is). I'm waiting for it to cool right now and I'm going to have some friends taste it this evening. Hopefully they would like it as much as I liked it. Thank you Georgie for such a great recipe!",
