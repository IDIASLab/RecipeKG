I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and tomatoe paste for the sauce.  I also had to add aaaaaalot of seasoning to the sauce to give it some flavor. I added paprika, extra worsteshire, red pepper flakes, seasoning salt and a healthy amount of old bay.  I added these ingredients a little at a time unti the creole was very flavorful and spicy.  Also, after peeling the shrimp I added a little salt and pepper and let them marinate in the fridge with hot sauce for about 20 minutes.  Overall, this recipe was great, however if you like your food flavorful you'll need to add a lot of seasonings.",
