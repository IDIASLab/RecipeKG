I used home made beef stock for the base instead of water stewed tomatoes for the diced barley for the rice black beans with the garbanzo. I chose to use frozen veggies because of their flavor and added limas string beans garlic shredded cabbage and some fresh asperagus. Today when I re-heated it I added a can of beef broth to make it thinner. This is the best veggie soup I've had in years - Thank you Colleen! Now I'm off to freeze some and send some over to my grandkids.",

I used beef stock instead of water and I didn't have leeks or peas; also I didn't have garbanzo beans so I used a can of butter beans and a can of kidney beans and it was wonderful. Instead of white rice I used pearl barley. I don't think you'll be disappointed by this soup--you can pretty much add whatever vegetable you have on hand.
