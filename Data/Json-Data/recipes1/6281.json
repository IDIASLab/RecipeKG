I found this recipe to be something totally different. I know they'll just love it. I never serve anything new until I've tried it first. I have to say that this is wonderful! I increased the amount of dressing as others suggested; and anyone who knows me knows I just have to add a cup of celery. I also left out the cheese and increased the grapes adding red as well as green. Oh my how wonderful! I'm excited to have found a recipe that none of my friends have yet! Thanks Allison!PS I used seashell pasta. The shape seems to hold onto the dressing better than other shapes.",

I would highly recommend trying them because they add a nice sweetness to the mix and really set this salad apart from others. The pasta shape I used is called Cellentani (I had never noticed it before. It's hollow like elbow macaroni but has a long spiral shape to it). The one thing I didn't like was the diced cheese - I thought the pieces were too big. Next time I'll try using shredded or grated cheese. Thanks Allison!",

I used deli sliced ham that I cut into small bites and I diced the cheddar very small. I also added carrots and cucumbers for some extra veggies.

I was not too sure of the combination of this salad but I was very very surprised that it turned out much better than I had hoped!!!!! I was looking for something to use up some grapes. I never seem to eat grapes after the first time and they always to to waste. So I tried this recipes and I will definately make again. I made it almost as written. My only changes were white vinegar because I didn't have cidar and med. cheddar...because of preference. I really think the sauce is what makes it great but also really love the great combination of ingrediance!!! YUM",
