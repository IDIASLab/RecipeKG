I seasoned my chicken quite well and I used chicken broth I'd made myself from Roast Sticky Chicken from this site--so those ingredients contained a lot of flavor. I had to use capellini rather than noodles since that is the only pasta my husband will really eat and I did use a heavy dose of butter with that. The Parmesan cheese adds a little more flavor and salt. It still cried out heavily for more flavor so I added a few leftover caramelized onions from my fridge. In the end I had to add some more of my favorite condiments. I recommend starting out with this recipe but having in mind and handy all the flavorings that you know you love with the ingredients.",

I am guessing because it is meant to be base and they are assuming that you will add in what you like to suit your own tastes. I started out by seasoning my chicken breasts with salt black pepper thyme rosemary and minced garlic. I also cooked the noodles in chicken broth for added flavor and added salt & pepper when I tossed them with the butter and parm. I then followed the recipe as written. The carrots took 8 minutes not 5 to heat and cook through. The noodles and carrots were very good - however I don't care for pan cooking chicken breasts this way. They always seem to come out dry. I suggest pounding your chicken flat before cooking it. But if I make this again I will cook my chicken & carrots with the broth in a slow cooker on low for 6 hours and then place on top of the noodles.",
