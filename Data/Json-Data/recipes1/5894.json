When you thaw the container, the basil won't turn color.  Use the best Extra Virgin Olive Oil you can afford! Thanks for the great recipe!",

Both have very strong flavors of their own, and too much of either will detract from the intensity of flavor you want from the basil.  I toasted the pine nuts in a skillet over medium heat for 5 or 6 minutes, added a pinch of sea salt and freshly ground pepper and did not use the optional parsley--it is neither traditional nor necessary.  The only reason to add this would be to help the pesto retain it's bright green color, since fresh basil has a curious tendency, unlike other herbs, to turn brown when cut. ",
