I read several ratings first and agree with several of the suggestions: Using less water is a MUST. 3/4 Cup is plenty. If you LOVE wings you need to use more hot sauce otherwise it doesn't taste like buffalo wings. I used 6 Tbs and next time I'll use even more. I used \"Frank's Red Hot\" and since it's a vinegar based hot sauce there's no need to use any cider vinegar. I also used 1 1/2 lbs of chicken and my husband feels that it still could use more so next time I'll try 2 lbs. Other changes were minor: no peppers or mushrooms whole wheat noodles and gorgonzola instead of bleu cheese. Other ratings suggested using celery (a wing staple) and jalapenos - I'll definitely give both of these a try. I'm looking forward to trying this one again.",

I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and added fresh parsley in the ricotta mixture. Instead of four cups of spaghetti sauce I used 2 cups mixed with 2 cups of alfredo sauce. I used 1/4 hot sauce to give it way more of that buffalo wing taste. I also sprinkled the blue cheese on top of all the ricotta layers as well as the top.",

The only problem was the onion was too crunchy...so we picked them out as we ate. Next time I'll either not use an onion or I'll cook the onion beforehand to get it tender. Other than that...it was AWESOME. Great creative recipe. I love lasagna...and I REALLY love Chicken wings...so this was perfect for me. Oh and I added a LOT more Hot sauce than recommended...but that's just me. I'm a hot sauce addict. I use \"Frank's Red Hot\" It's Hot...but not overpwhelming and lethal. It doesn't overpower the food. 2 tablespoons definetely wasn't enough. So if you like Hot sauce in general...I suggest adding more to this recipe. If not then just stick to the original formula.",

To prevent the onion and celery from being crunchy I sauteed them together in a bit of olive oil. I omitted the blue cheese due to personal preference. Instead of 12 lasagne noodles I needed 15 (5 per layer) to fully cover the pan (4 lengthwise 1 crosswise for full coverage). I found that I could use 2 cups of sauce in between layers rather than the 1 1/2 cups as stated. With 4 T. of hot sauce it had a bit of tangy-ness to it but was not overly intense. Both my hubby and I enjoyed this with these modifications. A nice change from standard lasagne.",
