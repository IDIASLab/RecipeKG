Mix differently: First cream butter and sugar together. Beat in eggs one at a time, add vanilla. Then add the premixed dry ingredients SIFTED to the batter alternating with the milk (1/3 flour mixture - 1/3 milk ending with milk) When you put in the cocoa to the 2 1/2 cups of batter SIFT THE COCOA\nI used salted butter and omitted the extra salt. Also, I used the whisk advise to creat a marbled effect. I put 3/4 of the chocolate batter, then all the white batter and then spooned in the rest of the chocolate batter and spreaded with a knife, then stuck in the whisk all around the cake. Perfect!\nGlazed with easy chocolate bundt cake glaze from this site\nNOTE: this is a dense but moist cake making these adjustments. You WILL need a glass of milk!\nI am giving this 5 stars ONLY BECAUSE I THINK THAT WITH THESE CHANGES ITS WORTH A TRY, AND TO ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO TRY IT! if I were to rate this recipe as is i wouldnt be able to because I didnt follow directions because in my book ingredients arent mixed that way and im not going to risk my ingredients\nUpdate: ok, so a day has past and this cake is definetly a 5. it is still moist. its covered only with plastic wrap. forgot to say i glazed this with a glaze found on this site: 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, 1 (14 ounce) sweetened condensed milk. heat on medium heat stirring constantly until chocolate ",

I was glad to have the tips ahead of time because they seemed to be just the ticket to a moist cake. My only complaints are that I have quite a sweet tooth and I would have liked the cake to be just a little more sugary. (I was looking to recreate something akin to Starbucks' marble loaf.) The other thing was the order of the ingredients being added was a little odd to me. The flour was the third ingredient and it made the batter like a thick cookie dough until I got the milk added. I may change the order in which I add them the next time I make it. Overall it was good and I'll try it again someday.",

We sliced it and had it with strawberries chocolate sauce and whipped cream it was lovely. The kids delared this \"version\" of strawberry shortcake THE BOMB. It was a great mix of not too chocolately or sweet but satified all those together. Mmmmm Thank you for this great recipe I will make it often!",

I tried it a second time following the many excellent suggestions to reduce flour change sequence of preparation etc. The result was dense and MOIST and quite tasty. Here's what I changed: Flour reduced to 3cups. Baking powder increased to 2tsp. Doubled the vanilla increased cocoa powder to 1/3 cup of more. also used brown sugar instead of white cause that's what I had. Whipped butter then sugar for a long while. Added eggs one at a time beating til smooth each time. Added flour-mix and milk in alternating thirds mixing just enough to blend. I checked for doneness long before the stated time and removed as needed.",
