Because of the bacon and cheese, this casserole was perfect as a meal; just served with a side salad.  I absolutely recommend this dish!",

IMHO I use the full amount of cottage cheese 2 ounces of ff cream cheese and 1/4 c of ff Greek yogurt in lieu of the sour cream. I was going to add the cheddar cheese to the dish but it really didn't need it... so I topped the dish with a little cheddar. only 1/4 cup. I think with all the other stuff added this might have been over doing it....so if you make this start with less of the add ins... you may not need or want them all.",
