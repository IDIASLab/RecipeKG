I have no idea why anyone would choose to mix it in the pan, though, unless it's just for the novelty of the idea, and to avoid dirtying a bowl.   Next time I make it (and I will make it again) I'm going to just mix it in a bowl and pour it in the pan.  I followed the directions this time, but stirring the mixture in a pan that's been greased and floured results in the cake sticking to the pan in places.  Not a huge problem, but it would be easier to serve if it came out cleanly from the pan.  Plus, the ingredients would be much easier to mix thoroughly in a bowl.  It's fun to call it a crazy mixed-up cake and give funny directions for making it, but it's not practical to stir it in the pan.  But it is a delicious cake, so thanks for the recipe, Peachey!",

I didn't want to run the risk of making a mess mixing it in the pan so I added everything but the chocolate chips to a bowl and mixed thoroughly. Then I dumped it in the pan and sprinkled the chocolate chips on top. It cooked for 35 minutes in a stoneware pan and came out with the perfect consistency and tasted fantastic. I made it for a scrapbooking crop and it was a HUGE hit. You can't get any easier than this and get this kind of flavor. Try it!",
