                "reviewBody": "Excellent recipe!!! I think the type of apple you use will determine how much sugar you need. I doubled the apples and per the recommendation of the local produce manager, I used 3 empire and 5 macintosh. Since these are naturally sweeter than pie apples, I cut the sugar in half, using 1/4 cup for the doubled recipe. I also cut the cinnamon, since I only like a hint of it. Since a few reviewers talked about it being watery, I let it simmer for about 45 minutes. Once it seemed thick enough for my liking, I used the potato masher to make it smooth. Very easy and tasty recipe. You will have to adjust the sugar according to the apples and your personal preference. With the apples I used and cutting the sugar, we took a vote. Two thought the sweetness was just right and three thought it was a little sweet. However, everyone enjoyed it.",

So I chose this recipe, but only as a reference.  Because it was for an infant not quite six months old I knew I would add no sugar or cinnamon.  But I'll tell you, even if I wanted to, there'd be no way I'd add this much sugar (a tablespoon per apple?) no matter what size the apples were. Also, knowing apples give off a lot of liquid, 3/4 cup of water seemed a lot.  I cut that back to 1/2 cup, and could have used even less - I think 1/4 cup would have been fine.   But that's 2/3 less than the recipe calls for!  I chunked rather than chopped the apples, so I could do a good fork test on a chunk of apple to make sure it was cooked until tender. Again, because this was intended for a baby, I ran it through the food processor (blender would have worked fine too) rather than mashing it. So two stars as written because of the overload of both sugar and water, even tho' it ended up pure and delicious.  I can't wait to see how little Andrew likes it!",

I used 4 small gala apples and 1 medium granny smith, added a little bit more water, and kept the peels on for added nutritional benefit. Next time I will peel them and chop up the peels into much smaller bits and add 'em in...I'll also probably cook it a few minutes longer, I think I probably let it sit on the stove for about 21-22 minutes, stirring occasionally but a few more minutes would of probably been better. I also didn't use an exact measurement on the 1/2 t of cinn. (Just kinda eye-balled it with a 1 t) and it was the perfect amount. I will probably use a tad less sugar too. \r\nAnyway... all my non-skills at cooking aside, this tastes SOOOOO good!!!! Thanks phatcat for making one of my first cooking experiences a positive one!",
