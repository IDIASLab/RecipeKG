I made mine too big, so by the time they cooked on top, the bottoms were pretty well done.  Just follow the recipe and make \"little balls\" and you'll be  good to go!\nUPDATE:  I made these the next night  with lemon cake mix.  I scooped a bit up with a teaspoon, rolled it in a ball, dipped it in sugar and baked.  They were super delicious.  Another Update:  We made these with dark chocolate cake mix and 1/2 bag of chocolate chips.  The best yet!  Perfection.",

I've tried several variations so far...yellow cake mix, with a chocolate drizzle...this were ok.  Then I tried chocolate cookies, rolling some of the balls in powdered sugar, and some in cocoa powder.  The cocoa powder disappeared, both in flavor and appearance.  But the powdered sugar comes out really nicely and tastes great.  However, my favorite variation so far was the one I just tried.  I followed the recipe exactly...choosing a BC Butter Pecan Cake mix.  Then I rolled the balls in a mixture of powdered sugar and cinnamon.  When I put them on the cookie sheet, I flattened them into little patties with my fingertips.  I let them bake just until they had risen a little.  I pulled them out before they had a chance to brown really (the cinnamon gives that appearance) and they were still very chewy in the middle when they were all cool.  I think it was about 7-8 minutes.  They were DIVINE!  I think they're my favorite cookie of all time, even better than chocolate chip cookies.  So try this variation, I think you'll like it.",

I read all of the reviews on the cookies with cake mixes and this is what I came up with.  I used 2 eggs, a yellow cake mix with pudding, 1/2 cup of oil, 2 teaspoons vanilla, and 1 1/3 cups quick cooking oatmeal.  I used a cookie scoop, patted the cookies flat and dipped them in a mix of cinnamon and sugar.  I baked them on a stone for about 10 minutes.  I removed them when they were still pretty gooey in the middle.  I let them sit on the cookie sheet for at least 2 minutes before removing them to cool on foil.  The next day, they are still crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.  They turned out like \"snickerdoodles\" which is one of my families favorites.  My kids loved these, they were so easy to make, and I enjoyed one with a cup of coffee this morning.  Thanks for the recipe!",

For those having trouble - too oily, too gooey, etc., it could be because you used the 15.25 ounce (Betty Crocker) cake mix rather than the 18.25 ounce size (Duncan Hines or Pillsbury).  Betty Crocker pulled that little stunt a while back.  And then they price the mix at $1.00 on sale, making you think you're getting one heck of a deal.  Believe me, you're not!  The loss of 3 ounces is significant in many recipes and shame on this company for trying to dupe us!  Try this recipe with Duncan Hines.... it's terrific!",

I added 10 oz can drained crushed pineapple (squeezing out through 2 coffee filters works better than a collander) and 1/3 cup shredded coconut.  Had half a tangerine and grated the zest of it also.  These made a wonderfully fluffy soft cake-like cookie.  Some of the coconut toasted which gave it a really nice flavor.  These were a wonderful combination with the pineapple mix, crushed pineapple, and coconut.  The batter was a softer batter I think because of the crushed pineapple, and although they did spread a bit, they weren't flat, but rose nicely and very soft.  Very nice recipe.",

I am going to try other combos like, Fun Chip Cake Mix with White Chocolate Chips or Chocolate Cake Mix with White Chocolate Chips and Macadamia Nuts or Banana Cake with Butterscotch Chips or White Cake Mix with Buttercream Frosting.
