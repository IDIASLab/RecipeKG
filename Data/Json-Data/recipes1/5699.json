I doubled the pasta and garlic (8 oz. pasta is not enough for all the tomatoes called for, and the dish needed more flavor), and found that this dish really needed more shrimp (will use 2 lbs. next time).  I didn't add oil to the pasta while boiling (simply not necessary), and I used only 1/8 cup oil in the sauce to cut down on the fat.  Using fresh herbs is key!  If you add the shrimp in Step 2 as written, they will be extremely overcooked.  Add them to the finished sauce that is still simmering (along with 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp. pepper), and they will cook in 2-3 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I used lemon basil and parsley that I grew myself, and added around 1/4 cup of heavy cream and about 2 Tbsp. tomato paste to make a more creamy sauce.  I only used one 28 oz. can of tomatoes, and I think next time I'll use three 14 oz. cans.  I think I forgot to drain the tomatoes, so it took a bit longer to cook down, but the flavor was incredible.  This is an excellent dish for company, and it was just as good reheated the next day.  This recipe rocks, Pat!  Thanks for sharing.  :)",

                "reviewBody": "Pretty good but I have a question - I used 3(15oz)cans of Italian diced tomatoes. The instructions say that they s/b \"drained\" - but then when it comes time to add the white wine it says to simmer until liquid is reduced by half. What liquid? When drained and mixed together w/ the wine there's barely any liquid to begin with. Yes the tomatoes naturally release a little liquid but when they're drained its not much. In fact I added half a can of tomato sauce just so the mix would cover the noodles properly. I understand that maybe this isn't supposed to be a \"saucy\" recipe but w/out some it would be really dry. Next time I'll try it but not drain all the tomatoes. It was still very tasty which is why I feel the dish is justified to try again. Also when sauting the garlic I added a couple TBLS of minced onion and put parmesan over each serving.",

My 3 stars is based on personal cooking knowledge of how this recipe and ingredients would have turned out had I followed directions. Hope my review is helpful for others because this recipe is not hopeless. 1: One can of tomatoes is more than enough. 2: For those who want more 'flavor' try using Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes instead of Italian. 3: Saute the garlic (I doubled) in the  olive oil then add the tomatoes, white wine, parsley and use appropriate amount of dried basil instead of fresh 'or' add the fresh basil just before serving (fresh basil does not hold it's flavor during the cooking process). 4: Use cooked frozen and thawed shrimp (I used cocktail shrimp because that's what I had on hand) but, no matter what size cooked and frozen, do not add to the sauce to heat it until after the sauce has boiled down and just beofre adding the cooked, drained pasta. 5: Cook the pasta while the sauce is cooking down 6: Do not use the oil in the water and do not drain the pasta because the oil keeps the sauce from sticking to the pasta and the starch from not draining helps the sauce to stick to the pasta better.",

I began by saut\u00e9ing the garlic in the oil (using only 1 T. of oil). Then added the tomatoes wine and parsley and reduced it by about half. I reserved the liquid from the can of tomatoes mixed it with a little cornstarch and used it to thicken the sauce. Then I added the raw shrimp and cooked them right in the sauce. I think this is much easier than fishing the shrimp out once cooked and then adding them back to reheat. And since the flavor of basil diminishes as it s cooked I always add it at the very end. I think next time I will add 1 T. of butter to the sauce to give it that wonderful silky smoothness. I served this over bow tie pasta but almost any pasta would work well.",
