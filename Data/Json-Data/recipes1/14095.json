The taste is GREAT!  \nThe first time the caramel came out too soft, so I put it back in the pot and reboiled.  It came out fine.  (I never could get it to ball and flatten like the directions say.)  Tip: use a bigger pot than you think!  It expands and bubbles quite a bit, and if it overflows on the oven it's a real pain to get off.  Also, be sure to butter the wax paper very well, or it will stick.  Next time I'll spoon the mixture onto little pieces of wax paper before it cools.  (Maybe buttered waxed paper in mini muffin tins would work?)  This way you don't have the pain of cutting it and getting that waxed paper off before wrapping the individual pieces.",
