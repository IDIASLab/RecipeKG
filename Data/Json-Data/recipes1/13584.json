Love the chocolate/orange combination.\r\nIf you line the pan with enough parchment paper to cover the sides and bottom with a little extra to fold over the pan's edges, you can easily lift the fudge out of the pan when you're ready to cut it into squares.  I cut it with a pizza cutter which made it very easy, and the pan didn't need to be washed!!",
