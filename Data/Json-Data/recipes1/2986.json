I followed other tips like beating the egg yolks a good 5 minutes, greasing the parchment paper very well and I put quite a bit of powdered sugar on the dish towel before rolling.  I had enough of the mousse left over to decorate.  Here's what I did and it was beautiful (will post a photo later).  I cut one end of the log (about 4\") at an angle.  Frost the sides, top and bottom and use some mousse to \"glue\" on the stump (piece cut off earlier) then frost the stump as well except for the top. Next run fork tines across the log and upward on the stump so you have ridges like a log. Then dust with powdered sugar and decorate with holly or mistletoe or pine sprigs.  I also made mushrooms from chocate truffles stuck onto a piece of broken candy cane rubbed with chocolate, and dipped in powdered sugar.",

You MUST BEAT the egg yolks and sugar until they are very pale.  For all of you Texas Aggies out there, BTHO the egg yolks.  Let the electric mixer run at the highest speed for at least 5 minutes.  Because this cake contains no rising agents like baking powder or yeast, its \"fluffy-ness\" depends upon the amount of air that you \"BEAT\" into it - hence the stiff egg whites and the pulverized egg yolks. \r\n\r\nWe decorated the cake with whipping cream and homemade mushrooms (hershey kisses and small marshmallows on toothpicks - with red gel polka dots).",

For anyone who has had trouble, make sure to follow all of the instructions AND the hints on the allrecipes page for this recipe. Remember, baking is a SCIENCE. There is NO FLOUR in this recipe! If you aren't getting the desired outcome, you are probably not beating the egg yolks/whites long enough. If there is no flour in something you are going to need to whip more air into the eggs to make the cake fluffy in the oven. Also make sure to let it cool a little bit before you try to roll it. The cake needs to set/solidify. Make sure to grease your pan, and make sure to use parchment paper and a towel coated in powdered sugar! Just basic hints, here, folks. If you care to see how mine turned out, click on the \"Photos\" and check for katelovesbaking's photo, its toward the end. :) For the mushrooms, I googled for a meringue mushroom recipe. It's very easy. I used a ziplock bag to pipe my meringue. For the green and red holly leaves/berries, my mum took gum drops and rolled them flat, and then used a knife to cut out the shapes! Good luck and have fun baking! :)",

The cake was nice and moist and my French students loved it! Here is what you need to know: 1. Grease the pan and the paper. 2. Beat the egg yolks until they are very very pale. The egg whites should be stiff enough to stand on the spatula. 3. Make sure the cake springs in the middle not just the edges. 4. Dust with lots of powdered sugar. 5. When you roll with the towel, roll the towel inside of the cake.  If you use the towel to roll the cake onto itself, it will stick and you might have issues. 6. Prepare this a day ahead. It is so much better the next day!  Thank you for the recipe. It is a keeper!",
