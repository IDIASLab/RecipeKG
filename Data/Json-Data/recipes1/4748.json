A lot of people mentioned that the dish was too spicy and suggested reducing the amount of jalapeno pepper by 1/4 cup. I halved the recipe and used 1/4 cup of jalapeno pepper and it turned out just fine (very mild). If you remove the membrane from the pepper you also remove some of the heat (the spiciness is contained in the membranes and seeds) so maybe other reviewers who complained about the heat didn't do that (?). I added some chopped (peeled) Granny Smith apple to the dish (it needed a sweet boost) but golden raisins would have worked just as well. I also used a yellow onion in lieu of the green onion called for (much cheaper and a more common ingredient in the dishes that I routinely prepare). Last I added cinnamon to the skillet (when adding the ginger). Just eyeball it (black pepper too). Used ground ginger (about 1/2 teaspoon in place of fresh ginger) with great results. This dish goes well with warm pita bread spread with hummus. Thanks for sharing!",

Not one complaint not even from my daughter who doesn't like spicy food. There is so much flavor that the first thing you notice about this si not the heat. I will make a gain and again for sure.

I laboriously picked out as many little slices of jalapeno as I could. After that it was very good...I added mushrooms as well. My mother positively commented on the hint of spice to the dish and I said I added a \"pinch\" of jalapenos. It was also her first time trying couscous--I used Near East's Sun Dried Tomato--it went very well. Also I've stopped using cornstarch or flour as thickener in meat or soup recipies--instant mashed potatoes work great; no one needs to know.",

I was worried for a bit about it being a bit too spicy because of other reviews but it turned out to be fairly mild in heat (I like hot food). A quick note: I recommend increasing serving size if you are actually serving four. I used 6 breasts and increased the other ingredients accordingly to feed three of my friends and myself (mind you all male grad students). Also a pinch of salt helped the flavor pop. Great dish I'm glad I tried it.",

On the hope the dish is this flavor throughout when using fewer jalapenos I'm giving the recipe four stars. (It'd be three otherwise.)",
