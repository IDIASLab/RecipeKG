It seems lighter than ours in a good way--thanks for sharing! We always add golden raisins and almonds in the batter--maybe 1/4 c each per loaf to your taste. And we sprinkle almonds on the top. This is SO GOOD warm or toasted. Thank you! (Check out our family's Kolacki recipe--Czech cookies.)",

There are discrepancies between the ingredients list and the instructions (salt and the amount of flour). The dough proportions were much bigger than a grapefruit orange and tangerine and there was no mention of how big around the dough ropes were supposed to be (mine were about an inch to an inch and a half around which seemed too big). Then the shaping of the dough pyramid was very odd. I baked it on a baking stone. The finished product was a rather tasty slighty sweet breakfast type of bread that reminds me of the Italian pan d'oro eaten at Christmas. I had to cover the bread with foil about 20 minutes in to the baking time because it browned rather quickly. I also had to bake it for about 45-50 minutes to fully cook the middle. Not bad overall but needs more specific intructions regarding working with the dough and please fix the discrepancies regarding the flour and salt!",
