I used wheat bread because that is what we had. It tastes like toast on top of hot chicken salad. I'll make it again.",

I've used any precooked chicken skin removed and de-boned as needed. I use brown rice cooked with chicken broth. I toast the almonds. A smaller jar of mushrooms is okay. I also add frozen peas or other froz veges to the mix. Important. DO NOT SUBSTITUTE the MAYO! The consistency is perfect due to mayo instead of milk. I find the measurements do not matter as much. I've used more rice less chicken and it was just as good. My man looks forward to this and to the leftovers. He usually hates leftovers.",
