The only thing that I did differently was put in about half of the potato slices, then a little dollop of the cheese sauce and then add the rest of the potatoes and top with the sauce.  The sauce is very thick, and I was concerned that the sauce wouldn't drizzle down through all of the potatoes.  GnarlyCow, thanks for a tasty and portable potato recipe.",

I covered them for 30 minutes then baked uncovered for 15 more. Turned the broiler on at the end to get them nice and brown. I'm not sure I needed to cover them but I was afraid they wouldn't be cooked all the way and I knew it couldn't hurt them. This simple cheese sauce made the best potato gratin I've ever had. I did use real parmesano reggiano cheese. Perfect pairing for any protein. Can't wait to make them again!",

I doubled the recipe and made 24, but I tripled the white sauce and used 1 cup milk per each 2 T. of butter and flour.  That is the standard I use when making any kind of sauce.  I used cheddar cheese, layered sauce in between, and topped with a bit more cheddar and chopped bacon.  I also added some onion powder to the sauce and seasoned each layer with salt & pepper.  Baked around 30 minutes uncovered.  Everyone loved them!",

I used mandolin to slice potatoes 1/8\" thick, then layered half into jumbo sized muffin tins (spreading 1/2 of sauce in middle as others suggested).  Because I had increased the size of the tins, I decided to go ahead and bake covered for 20\", then uncovered for adt'l 20 minutes.  My potatoes came out more steamed and ween't crunchy on the edges at all ... so I wouldn't suggest covering them next time.  We both agreed there wasn't enough sauce to suit our tastes - again, probably because I had increased size of tins.  I think next time I'll try dividing into 3 ramikins with more sauce *or* (now here's a brilliant idea) make 6 regular size cupcake tins with the same amount of sauce.  I didn't find any lack of flavor whatsoever and was quite pleased with the taste ... just need to work on the consistency part.  Thanks so much for recipe!",
