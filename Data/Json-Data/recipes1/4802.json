I also use more chicken, only 1/2 cup shredded cheddar which is cooked with the rest of the sauce ingredients until cheese is melted, then poured over cooked chicken, and steamed broccoli (make sure to pat with paper towels), and sprinkled with a bread crumb mixture of 2 tbsp. melted butter and 1/2 c. bread crumbs.  WONDERFUL!  This is excellent with Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice mix - originaly recipe, served on the side.",

I know that Chicken Divan does not have rice in it, but the rice would add a nice nutty texture and flavor, while absorbing some of the excess salt. Thanks Shannon.",
