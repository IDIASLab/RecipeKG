                "reviewBody": "This is the BEST bruschetta recipe I've ever tried, and I've tried a bunch of them! Here are a few tips from someone who has made this recipe at least a dozen times: 1) Once, I couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil and used the dry kind. Perhaps it was my imagination, but I think I lost some of that distinctive sun-dried tomato flavor. 2) The recipe suggests that you could use dried basil if you're in a pinch. That's true, but use it ONLY if you're in pinch! Fresh basil (I chiffonade mine) is part of what makes this recipe so absolutely delicious. 3) The recipe calls for shredded cheese, but I like to buy bulk mozzarella and slice it into pieces that are about 1/8\" thick, and that are sized to fit onto the bruschetta. That keeps your cheese from falling off the sides, and it creates a nice \"blanketing\" effect over your tomato mixture that keeps it from falling off when you're eating it. Enjoy!",

I also plan on cutting the amount of olive oil used in half to only 1/8 cup. From the suggestions of previous reviewers I decided to brush olive oil onto the bread, broil it for a couple minutes, then add the topping. The cutting of the tomatoes did take a bit of time and I think substituting a couple cans of diced tomatoes would be fine. Just be sure to use FRESH herbs! I will be adding this receipe to my regular rotation.",

I would definitely suggest letting it marinate over night - the longer the better.  I also took someone's suggestion to put the cheese on the bread and bake it first - then everyone can put on their own amount of bruschetta.  Everyone agreed that was the better way to go.  This really is easy to make - I also definitely suggest using fresh basil and buying the bread the day you are serving it as well.",

                "reviewBody": "Love this recipe.  Have made it many times since finding it online...  There is a reason this recipe lists roma/ plum tomatoes as the tomato of choice.  They are meatier than a beefsteak, early girl, or some of the other varietals available.  Using romas will eliminate some of the wateriness that other reviewers have mentioned.  If you have the opportunity to make this a day ahead, it gives the flavors a chance to marry and allows the garlic to mellow somewhat ~ so MUCH better!  Absolutely great as it is, but decided to try adding a smidgen of anchovy paste to it on the third time.  It sent it over the edge from outstanding to sublime!!!   Thanks so MUCH for this recipe!!!",

Tried them out on family this weekend before I take it to a party next week.  Got rave reviews!  These are the things I changed: 1) Used 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes rather than cutting up tomatoes.  (Tasted great and much easier!) 2) Our grocery store didn't have sun-dried tomatoes so I used sun-dried tomato spread...worked great!  3)Definitely brush the bread slices w/olive oil first and throw in oven for 5 min at 400 degrees. Bread was not at all soggy, yet not too hard either 4) Use both parmesan (fresh) and mozzarella on top.  5) put back in 400 degree oven for @5 min till cheese melts.  Very good stuff!!",
