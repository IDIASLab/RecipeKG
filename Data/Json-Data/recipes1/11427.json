He first soaked the pheasant in Kosher salt for 24 hours and then cut all meat (thighs legs and breasts) into bite-size pieces. When frying he used an electric frying pan and added enough oil (about 1 inch) to almost cover the nuggets. Frying time was about 6-8 minutes. Next time I am going to serve these with a honey mustard dip and ranch/spicy ranch dip. They were definitely a hit with our family!",
