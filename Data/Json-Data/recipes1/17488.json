All of the flavors go together so well and it is a very easy recipe that was fast to throw together with great results.  After reading the reviews, I made a couple of small changes. I pre-baked the crust for 10 min at 350 and allowed it to cool for a few min.\r\nFor the mustard, I used a couple of TBS of Grey Poupon and then mixed in a couple of tsp of stone ground mustard and spread approx 3/4 of that mixture on the crust.  I sliced the tomatoes and then placed them all on paper towels for approx \r\n30 min to drain and then proceeded with the recipe.  All of these small changes worked\r\nout very well in preventing a soggy crust and watery filling.  We will definitely make this again very soon. Thanks for sharing!!",

Both delicious but gruyere would be even better. Drained tomatoes on paper towels and made a couple layers of tomatoes and cheeses the second time with fresh garden herbs (basil rosemary chives and thyme) throughout with a few sprinkled on top. Would like to try this recipe with brie. It made a beautiful presentation and was well-liked by all. The first piece comes out messy but following slices come out surprisingly neatly and it's not too liquid-y.",

I didn't have nor have I heard of herbes de Provence but when I looked it up it consisted of: savory fennel basil thyme lavender and rosemary. I used fresh - thyme basil chives & rosemary chopped fine. When I put in one layer of tomatoes too much crust was left so I made with 2 layers of cheese and 2 layers of tomatoes and 2 layers of fresh herbs. The taste was wonderful but the tomatoes made it a little watery. After dishing out the first piece I drained off the extra juice and it was fine. The slices served up nicely and I will be making again since I have oodles and oodles of tomatoes. Thanks Snackybits for sharing your recipe.",

Mustard overpowered this and the crust is completely wet from the oils in the mustard and the cheese, and water in the tomatoes. I did deseed and drain the tomatoes a bit first and it still was soggy. Despite the mustard pow, the taste combinations work well together and if you could cut that back, or maybe add a little sugar,  and get the crust to stay dry, this would be a winner.
