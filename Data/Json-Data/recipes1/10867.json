One reviewer said these aren't really Australian, but I don't think they're intended to be, oddly enough, so hold the Vegemite.  Oroweat used to make a product like this called Australian Toaster Biscuits - who knows why the name.  But this recipe, I think, is meant to duplicate that.  Oroweat's product was discontinued years ago, but I still miss it.  The taste and texture are similar to what I remember, and I will make these again.",

So one cannot consider this a negative nor even a neutral review because I changed it from the beginning. On the other hand what I wound up with wasn't half bad and I'll probably make it again.:) I was hoping for something that resembled the \"Australian Toaster Biscuits\" that Thomas' used to sell. Based on other reviews I reduced the salt to 1.5 tsp and added 1/4 c milk. The salt reduction wasn't enough. I added about 3 tbsps of sugar which overcame the salt problem. Made the first two and still didn't like them very much. I'm not really a fan of sweets but I decided I might as well just make them honest-goodness \"sweet biscuits\" and added an additional 1/4 c of sugar. They came out tasting pretty darned good. Next time however I will reduce the salt to 1 tsp and up the milk by an additional ounce or two.",
