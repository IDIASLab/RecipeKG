I added 1/2 of a small banana to the pudding mixture for flavor (not the whole banana, because you don't want to \"over-kill\" the flavor). It was perfect!  I used the small 1 ounce boxes of pudding and it was a perfect amount for one pie. I think because I used the marie calendar pie pans and they are smaller than 9 inches. I noticed that a some people had extra pudding and I think it's because it depends on the size of the pie pan used. Ok for member SENORITA132, you said the pie was too watery... the recipe says to \"whisk\" the pudding, but I would suggest using a mixer and beat it until it's nice and thick. It worked for me this way rather than using a whisk. Also, thank you to BAVERDUCE for your suggestion about dipping the bananas in lemon juice so that they don't brown. It really works!",

I sprinkled some graham crumbs on the top of the whipped cream (of which I used only about 1 cup).",
