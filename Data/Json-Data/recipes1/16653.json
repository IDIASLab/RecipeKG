First, didnt want to make a big one so only used one can of crescent roll dough, then did the ham layer, a couple scrambled eggs (with cheese mixed in) layer and a layer of thawed frozen spinach. Sprinkled some blue cheese along the top and closed it up as directed. Brushed with butter and baked. Wow! What a great breakfast treat, Hubby and I ate all but two slices. I am thinking of several options for the filling that I will try (diced tomatos, olives, mushrooms)-the possibilities are endless. I also am thinking maybe some cream cheese filling with blueberries mixed in to make it into a type of danish. Thanks for posting this great recipe.",

In spite of halving this recipe since making for two used about 1/3 cup of peppers (blend of red bell sweet and jalapeno peppers). Very versatile dish where other popular breakfast meats can be subbed for the ham (we sometimes use a spicy sausage) and other veggies can be added. The reason for cutting the dough into strips is to eliminate overlapping dough since any underlying layer(s) will have a more doughy texture than the golden brown top layer. Knowing that you can fold or cut the dough in any number of ways and still get excellent results. We serve this with a homemade finishing sauce. Served alongside some fruit this makes for an elegant brunch. We would give this more than 5 if possible. Thank you tiberlady for sharing this fantastic recipe.",

The interior ingredients were perfectly cooked texturally.   The bottom line is ... the taste of the Cresent dough (at least the Pilsbury brand) is far too sweet to complement this savory dish in a pleasingly balanced way.  The recipe is worth developing as a sweet dish or suggesting a different crust type (maybe pie dough).  Also... a word to the wise...DO NOT prepare this on a 9x13 baking sheet.  Two crescent sheets won't fit.  Keep the dough fairly chilled, work on parchment paper and transfer to baking sheet on parchment paper for baking.",

You can do an uneven number of slices so they don't match and it will still come out gorgeous. Since I've made very similar recipes before I didn't worry too much about adjusting the ingredients because I didn't have everything called for. I brushed pesto on the bread first then used a Laughing Cow cheese (2 wedges) as the cream cheese layer used vegetarian sausage and scrambled three eggs put on top then closed the loaf and baked. Tasted good looked pretty and was mostly eaten at a work breakfast. Thanks for the recipe!",
