This cured the craving and I know hubby will LOVE it!\n\nI didn't have many fresh veggies since returning, but I had onions. And, I used 1 can of crushed tomatoes and 1 can of seasoned tomatoes with onion and celery. Because of the heat level in India I had to add more hot sauce though. \n\nI'll make this again!\n\n----- October 23, 2008 ----\n\nHe loved it, and it is a classic staple in our kitchen.

Even our teen that doesn't like tomato soup had 3 bowls (I had adjusted the recipe for 10 servings).  I did tweak this recipe a bit.  My basil plant is looking sad, so I added about 2 TBS fresh pesto.  Instead of simmering on the stove top, I put everything into the crock pot on high for about an hour and added fat free 1/2 and 1/2 at the end.  I left out the Worcestershire because we didn't have any vegetarian and no hot pepper sauce as my hubby doesn't do spicy.  I added veggie broth to the veggies after sauteing and simmered them a bit and ran that mixture through the blender.  I put the tomatoes in the blender too, but left some chunks.  I boiled up some fun shapped pasta for the kids to add in if they wanted.  There is not a drop of this soup left.",
