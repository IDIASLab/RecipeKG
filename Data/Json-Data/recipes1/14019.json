Then, I might add about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg and/or a dash of ginger or clove powder. Thirdly, I think it might be interesting brushing salted butter between phyllo sheets. Finally, I think it would be a good idea to give the strudel an egg or egg yolk wash before baking. That way, I think it would be close to perfection. Yet, this is a good basic recipe.",

I used half the butter than called for, spraying some of the phyllo sheets with a bit of cooking spray instead to keep the sheets from drying out, and preventing greasiness. Most of the butter I used went on the outer layer after rolling up the strudel, which gave it a lovely golden color after baking. I used Gala apples, for a sweet-tart taste, and one half-teaspoon of a blend of cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, ginger, and a touch of cloves. I didn't have golden raisins or currants, so I used half a cup of regular raisins, and it turned out fine. The family really enjoyed it, and have asked for it again.",

I was really surprised that the end result looked unfinished and seems to need some kind of glaze to look pretty enough to serve or give to someone. I also expected more punch to the flavor with all the apple raisins currants and spices but the flavor was very mild. The phyllo was so flaky it was hard to contain and my family got phyllo pieces everywhere. The flavor grew on me though and it was delightful with an espresso. I think I'll make up some kind of cinnamon glaze and see if that finishes it off.",
