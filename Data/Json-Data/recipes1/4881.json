The term can now apply to any superior cook (yes, men too), and also to this dish (chicken, ham and Swiss cheese slices, breaded and sauteed). This yummy version adds paprika and a creamy white wine sauce worthy of its own blue ribbon. Two blue ribbon tastes in wedded bliss -- Chicken Cordon Bleu II!",

First, pound the breasts to half-inch thickness at least (this will let you reduce the 30 min cook time to about 15, max).  Then, reduce fat a little by using half butter and half olive oil when you brown (3 tbsp. of each).  Oil will keep the butter from burning, too.  Third, if you want to eliminate wine, just use 1/2 cup chicken broth (from a can, if needed) -- or just use salted water.  No big deal.  Last, when I blend the cream at the last stage, I like to add about 1/4 cup fresh chopped basil to the mix -- serve with chopped fresh basil on top, too - or substitute whatever herb you like (fresh is best, but only add it last).",

Second, I fried the chicken in butter for about 10 minutes until it was nicely browned, then I put it in the oven at 350 for another 20 minutes. Instead of simmering the chicken in the sauce, I whisked the cream,wine, bouillon and cornstarch in a bowl, then simmered it for about 10 min. alone, and spooned it over the chicken.\r\nIt turned out fantastic. My fiancee` said this was the best dish I ever made, and he's more of a beef man. Thank you!",

All ages LOVED this meal served with rice pilaf and roasted asparagus and quartered bella mushroomsi. I recommend an oven roasted, no water added ham, and a good quality wine.  After making this again recently, I learned that even a small chicken breast, after pounded and filled, is too large a portion.  My 6 adult guests could only eat half of theirs.  Going forward, I will slice this into 1 inch rounds (much prettier, too) as pictured in photo number 26.  Thanks, Behr.",

Serving it over rice and asparagus makes for a deliciously unified and well-rounded meal. I just tripled the wine and boullion after i took the chicken out and let it cook off a little, then added triple the whipping cream and triple the cornstarch, plus a little paprika for color. Some people point out that the swiss melts out of the chicken, which can be solved by wrapping the swiss in a few thinnly-sliced pieces of ham. This is one of my favorite meals, and it's amazingly easy!",
