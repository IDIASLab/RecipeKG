After all it's still just doctored up canned soup. I used fresh carrots rather than canned added mushrooms cooked crumbled bacon fresh minced garlic and a glug of white wine. This was way too thick for my liking but was easily remedied by throwing in some chicken stock. The soaking step for the rice simply isn't necessary---just cook it beforehand as the package directs and add it at the end. The final result was very good but it was a lot of tinkering around for what was still canned soup. I would have been better off and with the same amount of work just making the darned soup from scratch.",

The first time I cooked it the wild rice was still a little bit stiff even after soaking for nearly 7 hours so the second time I cooked it I put the whole works in the crockpot for a few hours after it was all mixed together and it was DELICIOUS! My husband even liked it and he is not a big fan of wild rice/chicken dishes. My Dad and his girlfriend loved it too as did my Mom. I will definitely make this again and again. It freezed beautifully so I pull out one serving at a time for my lunch and microwave and stir until it's warm enough to eat. Yum!",
