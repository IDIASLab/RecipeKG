I used cous cous instead of rice added about a clove more of garlic and seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt and pepper. Followed the cooking directions to a T and it turned out amazing! I also used a blend of parmesan and asiago and sprinkled some more on top when serving. Will be making this again!",
