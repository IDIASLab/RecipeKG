For those who complained that their pork chops were dry, take the time to brine them first...you will never have dry tasteless pork chops again. (Brine...1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup Kosher salt dissolved in 3 cups water + add 2 cups ice. Soak in brine for up to 2hrs. NB. If you use ordinary salt instead of Kosher you MUST cut down on the amount or it will be way too salty). I used 1 inch thick bone-in chops and brined them for about 90 min before drying them and stuffing them with the apple/gorganzola filling. Then I seasoned them with pepper, dredged them in flour and pan fried them just to give a golden brown colour before finishing them in the oven for 20 minutes. Then left them about 10 minutes to rest under foil while I prepared the sauce. Yum! Perfect \"gourmet\" comfort food for a chilly night.",

Just long enough to golden-brown the outside of the chops. they stayed perfectly moist inside, and got a little more of the crispy, carmelized flavor you expect from grilled pork.\nPerfect.",

But they thought it was fantastic and there wasn't a scrap left. The combination of the cheese and apples is wonderful and not overpowering in the least. I was confused about \"reincorporating\" the cheese but took it to mean that the cheese needed to be completely blended. Take time with the sauce. It does take a while to turn a darker brown but that really does contribute to the flavor. Thank you for this fantastic recipe!",

The gorgonzola is not overpowering in the stuffing or the sauce. Pork chops baked with apples are an old stand-by but here their use is delectable. The final result with sherry sauce and all is delicious and sophisticated. I followed the author's suggestion serving spiced potatoes with onions (try Lipton's soup mix for a short-cut) and added dilled pea pods and baby carrots. The combination was great.",
