As for the sauce, no one in my family cared for it and I had to rinse it all off.  I must say I will continue to cook pork tenderloin this way, and leave out the mustard, horseradish, and cayenne.  Instead I will saut\u00e9 some mushrooms and onions in the pan, add the broth and cream, and go with that.  IMO, browned pork has a wonderful flavor and aroma all its own, and hiding that with horseradish is a mistake.",

Another stellar recipe! It's perfect! No changes needed at all. I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did. We couldn't stop eating it! Because it's summer, I try to grill everything, but I stopped myself and decided to stick with the recipe and make it as stated. What a great cooking method. Very easy, and the meat comes out perfectly cooked. The 2 tenderloins I was roasting were different sizes. The smaller one was perfectly done at 20 mins, and the bigger one was done at 25. While I was making the sauce, I transfered the pork to a large sheet of foil and wrapped it to keep warm. The meat was so tender and juicy. This one is company worthy and is sure to impress everyone (or at least those with good taste!).",
