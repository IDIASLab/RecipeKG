Some recommendations: use italian sausage, a mix of red and yukon gold potatoes (they're what I had on hand and turned out great!), add a couple splashes of Tobasco, and use red onion =). I also added some spices based on personal preference. This is AWESOME and easy to tweak to perfection. (Note: I let this simmer for about an hour and the consistency was perfect!)",

That being said I was in a chowder mood. I tweaked the recipe a little bit I added half a pound of breakfast sausage and a package of bacon ends which I fried together and added to the chowder. In the bacon/sausage grease I fried the onions until they were just beginning to become translucent so they still had a crunch. Fabulous recipe my last corn chowder sucked this one completely redeemed the meal. Thanks!!",
