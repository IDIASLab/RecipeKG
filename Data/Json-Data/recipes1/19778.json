For some reason, I always thought Braciole was a challenging, time-consuming dish to make but this is so easy and so incredibly delicious! (I love recipes that taste and look complex, but really aren't! This one fits the bill perfectly!!) I rarely tweak a Chef John recipe, but I did substitute basil for the oregano (simply personal preference, but I did add a dash of oregano as well) and I admit, I was tempted to leave out that pinch of red pepper flakes. I am so glad I didn't! It was just a tiny hint of \"heat\" that complemented this dish perfectly! Thanks for another fabulous recipe that my family has asked be put into the \"regular rotation\"! :-) And be sure to watch the accompanying video. Chef John gives some great hints and tips and talks about using other cuts of beef and how to cook them a bit differently for tenderness.",

This recipe came out very similar to hers! \n\nI would highly recommend this recipe, aside from my grandmother making it, I also worked in a very high end authentic Italian restaurant for 10 years that had excellent braciole. This recipe gave both a run for their money! I was surprised at how delicious it was, not only tender but rich and layered with spices that blended amazingly while still being able to identify the different flavors. \n\nI have since made other recipes from Chef John and he is an amazing chef! I, and the rest of the allrecipes community, are very lucky to have this gentleman contribute! Thank you for all of your fantastic recipes!",
