If you are used to Pennsylvania Dutch food though - it will be perfect as written! I can eat it as a meal by itself with some crusty bread slathered in butter.",

(NOTE: Oikos is the creamiest Greek yogurt I've tried so far -- Cabot is pasty) My typical choice for \"sour cream\" has been Greek yogurt for years and I change between the three fat contents at will choosing whichever I think will be good in the recipe. I'm convinced that this recipe would be good with any of them. I cut back on the sugar (to taste) to be sure it keeps its sour tang and used 1 Tbsp more flour. My father-in-law grew up in Southwestern New York State and loved a recipe his mother made. No one has ever been able duplicate her recipe successfully -- it always curdles. Dad's mother gave the recipe to his new bride and when she made it for him as a newlywed humiliation was the result. She never tried it again so Dad hasn't had it in over 60 years. This year his Thanksgiving table will have this sour and creamy cabbage on it and made by yours truly. My wonderful mother-in-law has been gone for several years now but at least her sweetie will have the opportunity to reminisce on his childhood while he feasts.",
