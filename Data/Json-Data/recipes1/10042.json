Extra spices - I used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice. 2. An extra banana. 3. Nuts (I used walnuts) and raisins. Those are probably the 3 most important changes I made, but I also used 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour and used 50% lighter butter instead of shortening. Oh, and added a capful of vanilla extract. These are absolutely to die for!!! Also used only 3/4 c. sugar, 1/4 c. of which was actually Splenda...still found them very sweet and didn't notice the splenda.",

I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and instead of shortening I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup of Smart Start butter spread. I thought the batter was rather dry so I added a second banana and then 2/3 of a cup of dried cranberry's. I calculated the total calories which came out to 3 330 for the entire batch and 121.75g fat. I yielded 50 cookies so that came to 67 cal's per cookie and 2.4g fat! Thanks for a great cookie:o)",

I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp added a splash of vanilla and added 1/4 tsp pumpkin spice but it's not necessary -- just preference. The trick is to spread out your spoonful of dough with the spoon after dropping onto the cookie sheet b/c it won't flatten out much by itself while baking. That way you get a finished result that looks like a cookie instead of a glob of baked dough. Thank you for the recipe! Will definitely make again!",
