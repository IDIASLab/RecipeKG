Anyway, my trick for perfect mashed potatoes I learned from a chance viewing of a few minutes of Cooking with Emeril (or whatever it was called...) several years ago. He instructed to return the drained potatoes to the pot for a few minutes before adding the ingredients and mashing them. The heat removes the excess moisture. I didn't watch to see how he recommended mashing them but I have always used an electric mixer (now a stand mixer) and ever since I began following his method I have not had that gummy, gluey, watery, whatever-you-wanna-call-it it's yucky consistency.

Add my butter and the heavy cream to the potatoes in the same pan and let it bubble just a bit. Off of the burner and mash the old fashioned way. Aaaaah, these can not be beat by any chef!!!!!
