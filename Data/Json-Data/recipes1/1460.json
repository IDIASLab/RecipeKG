My husband and son are devouring them as I type this, and I will DEFINITELY make these again (and again and again). If your blueberries all fall to the bottom, try rinsing them BEFORE coating them with flour next time. If your batter isn't rising - perhaps your baking powder is stale. Keep it in the fridge, and buy fresh every four months or so. It goes stale fairly quickly, so buy small containers unless you do a LOT of baking.\r\n\r\nThese muffins are fantastic with chopped apricots, and with chopped apples and dates :)",

I halved the recipe and only made 12, the only thing I did differently was I only used 1/2 of the Baking Powder that the recipe called for, but they turned out wonderfully!!  To keep the blueberry's from sinking, I rinsed them and then immediately floured them.  Then right before I added them to the batter, I floured them a little bit more.  They didn't sink at all!  What a great recipe! ~Amy",

Plus they didn't really have that nice puffy muffin shape I'm used to even after baking these in a Texas sized muffin tin. What a waste of ingredients! I definitely won't be making these again....",
