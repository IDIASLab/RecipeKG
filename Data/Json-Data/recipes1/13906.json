I like it a little better with less coco (I like milk choc more than dark choc), but either way everyone that tries it says it tastes just like the kind you have to stand and stir over the stove! \r\n\r\nI've put pecans in some batches and love it. The trick to getting it to set right is to make sure the milk and butter get HOT. Also, it helps if you sift your sugar together with the coco so it is already mixed for the most part (I have even heated the milk and butter in the microwave, then mixed in with the sugar and coco - then added the vanilla last). Make sure you stir REALLY fast and pour before it gets cool... that way it leaves a nice shiny top - if you stir after it cools it looks a little lumpy on top.\r\n\r\nI also line my pan with foil so it is easy to lift out and cut into squares.",

It is also tough to get out of the pan... so if you line the pan with tin foil you can take the whole thing out onto a cutting board and just peel the tin foil off then cut it into squares.  I also recomend storing what's left in the fridge.  It's also fun to mix in baking candies. This is the only fudge recipe I'll ever be making! :-)",

I cut the stick of butter or stick margarine at the 6 Tablespoon mark and I add 2 Tablespoons of cocoa to the 1/2 half cup. So a little more powder and a little less butter and I use a buttered loaf pan instead of the 8 x 8 pan so get thick pieces of fudge. I get all ingredients ready and put the milk and butter in the microwave 2 minutes, then quickly add the 4 cups of powdered sugar (which is the same as a one 1 lb box), the cocoa and vanilla. Stir well. Once it has all been stirred well, I sometimes add 1/2 cup of chopped nuts or swirl a few heaping tablespoons of peanut butter in (don't mix the peanut butter into the fudge, just swirl a bit so it is evenly distributed). Refrigerate until firm enough to cut. I use a thick knife to deeply cut down into the fudge & cut longways in half, then half again, then across into squares. Dig one corner out first, etc.",
