Used a dehydrator and did one layer to be sure, and added sea salt, as others suggested using salt.  Very good.  Will definitely load up the dehydrator on all 5 levels next time.  Froze them in a freezer bag.  Tried one after frozen and tastes great.  It was hot and humid here, and some of my golden cherry tomatoes were very large, and it took nearly the 12 hours.  The smaller regular sized sweet 100's were done a little quicker, but not by much, so I left most of them and they were all fine.",

After I freeze them I take out what I think I can use within 2 or 3 weeks put them in a jar and cover them with avocado or olive oil. I really live the buttery flavor of avocado oil the best though. This is an easy recipe and SO rewarding during the long dreary winters when all you can think of is fresh tomatoes from the garden again.",
