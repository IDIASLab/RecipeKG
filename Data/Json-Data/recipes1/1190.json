This dough was so easy to work with.  I'm so impressed with myself...the dough was delightfully flaky.  I've always stayed away from making pie crust...but no more!!  Peach season is just starting here and i can't wait to try my hand at a pie with this dough!  Thank you Stephanie!!  UPDATE:  Since writing my review six months ago, I've gained a reputation for my flaky pie crust. I've been asked numerous times to make pies for gatherings. For people who have problems with this recipe, here are a few suggestions:  Add an extra tbsp of water to the mixture, roll the dough between 2 pieces of waxed paper to prevent sticking and for easy transfer,  and even though the recipe says to chill the dough, you don't have to.  I've been working with this dough without chilling it, and I find it turns out even flakier, and is so easy to work with. Hope this helps!",

OMG this was the best pie crust ever! \r\n\r\n***For anyone looking to double the recipe use 2 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 teas salt, 1 cup chilled shortening and 1/4 cup AND 2 tbs ice water. My sister doubled it wrong and although it was harder to work w/ it still tasted great! \r\n\r\nFrom reading all the reviews and will next time use the wax paper under and over the dough to help me roll it out and place it in the pie pan. But really this was so easy to make and was easy to work with, for the most part. Next time I'm going to try it w/ butter just to see the taste difference. My MIL couldn't stop talking about the crust. This is definatly a keeper! THANKS!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***UPDATE*** I now make this crust all the time and I now use sticks of butter right out of the fridge instead of chilled Crisco and I like the taste much better. I've used this for all kinds of pies, even chicken pot pie and it goes great w/ anything you want to use it for. Also for a tip.. spread milk over the top of the crust and sprinkle w/ sugar before baking for a sweeter crust. Ummmm... Gotta go make some pies for Thanksgiving!",

On the surface you plan to roll out your pie dough, take a clean wet cloth, wipe the surface and IMMEDIATELY BEFORE IT DRIES, sprinkle flour over and rub it around. You will be able to roll out your dough without any trouble. Trust me I know. I experimented for a long time before I learned this trick. Just add more flour to the surface for more pie crusts.Good luck. Sandy",

Turned out really great. (though there wasn't enough for one quiche)\r\nTo roll out the dough:\r\nTake a piece of clingfilm. On top of it you put the dough. Cover it with another piece of clingfilm. Then roll out the dough. Remove the upper layer of plastic. Put it up side down in your pie pan and pull the plastic off.\r\nSo easy, I assure you won't have any problems! (And you don't need extra flour this way)\r\nI froze the crust, then prebaked it for 15 minutes. Brushed the crust with some eggwhite and put it back in the oven for 30 seconds (so it becomes 'waterproof') then put the filling in it.\r\nTry this recipe!\r\n\r\nCaroline",

However, it's an excellent single crust for custard and cream pies and my favorite for pumpkin pie. It will come out flaky and soft and dry on the bottom for a great tasting pie and it holds up well for presentation and serving. It's best not to overwork the dough and if it's too sticky or dry, you can adjust the flour and water some and still come  out with a great crust.   I prefer to cut the dough not like course crumbs but like pea or hazelnut sized pieces and then blend the water.  This makes the dough stick together better when kneaded and folded.  I also keep the edges of the pie covered for the duration of the cooking time.  The crust is baked through and tastes  good so you won't be scraping pie crust edges of of company's plates.",
