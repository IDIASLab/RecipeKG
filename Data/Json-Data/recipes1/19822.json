This recipe was great last night. The only change I made was to add some black olives to the toppings. I got the casserole assembled before leaving to get my daughter from practice and had the oven preheat while I was gone. It was all ready for me to just pop in the oven after we got back and baked while she got some math homework done. This recipe is simple enough that my 13 year old novice chef was able to easily help. The only suggestion I have is that the cooking time is not long enough and as 8 oz containers of pizza sauce are difficult to come by there is some unnecessary waste involved. Next time I will be sure to double the recipe to make two of these and bake them for 30 minutes.",

I topped it with ingredients we normally have on our pizza such as extra pepperoni sausage medallions peppers red onion and mushrooms. When I tossed the sauce and cheese with the biscuits I also added some salt pepper garlic and Italian seasoning. After baking 20 mins it still seemed doughy so I put it on broil for 5 minutes which also allowed the cheese to get nice and brown. With these modifications the recipe was so delicious and even my extremely picky husband loved it. I was skeptical about making a pizza with biscuits but they made such a phenomenal base. Next time I will cook even longer because it was still a bit doughy but definitely still edible.",

My peanut gallery consists of 4 kids with me always being the 5th. the vote was 3 who didn't care for it and 2 who liked it (with a thinner crust).",
