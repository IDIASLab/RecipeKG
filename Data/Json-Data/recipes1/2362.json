They instead recommend a 5 ingredient recipe (they don't give one) which this is. The two ingredients for the shell and the three for the filling.  The recipe does need to be followed and the ingredients need to be fresh - no bottled or frozen juice.  Any lime other than Key lime will give it a different flavor and not congeal the eggs and milk properly.  Also, it does need to be kept refrigerated in order to keep it reasonable solid.  Real key lime pie will not be solid if left at room temperature for more than an hour.   And yes, the eggs are cooked by the citric acid.  ",

This is like substituting maraschino cherries for whole tart cherries. You might get lucky and save the dessert but you're not making the dessert you picked. This recipe is a standard real (yes it's not fake just because the ingredients are few) key lime pie recipe which makes one standard real key lime cake. Tips for people who are worried about their cake surface being lumpy/get lumps in their surfaces: hold the pan in both hands after pouring in the filling and gently shake horizontally to flatten it. Also overbeating this will give you little bubble craters in the surface. Good luck!",

I made a key lime pie about 3-4 weeks ago with the recipe from Nellie & Joe's Famous Key West Lime Juice and we liked it better. It is very similar except it uses 3 egg yolks 1/2 c key lime juice and is baked. I'm inclined to agree it was better than this one although this one is perfectly nice as well. Worries about whether or not lime juice cooks raw eggs aside (and I do believe those who say it does) you can use pasteurized egg substitute and not worry about it either way which is what I did. I didn't have any problem with this setting. It is a bit runny still but I think any key lime pie without gelatin is going to do that. I used the Mock Graham Cracker Crust from here and it worked well with the key lime filling. Thanks for the recipe!",
