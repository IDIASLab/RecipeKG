I also have a kidlet here who loathes all raisins on earth, so I used dried cranberries instead, which IMO works great with lemon, so I think it was a safe substitution.   I also mixed in 2 tsp of dissolved cornstarch, just my preference, because I like my rice puddings very thick.  It came out perfectly.  Lightly sweet, bright flavors, and so healthy for such a great treat!  There is no way this recipe was bland.  Also,the cinnamon and almonds sprinkled on top were perfect.  I've made rice pudding the 'old way' a hundred times... it was never this good.  Thanks for a great recipe!",
