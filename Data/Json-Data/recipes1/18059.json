Not right. I used 1 c. plus 1/2c. shredded Italian cheese blend. #2. Recipe calls for 1/2c of sauce yet in directions you are to use 1/3c. x 4 chicken breasts...? You need to 'eye this up' and put enough sauce on each piece. #3 - You cannot use 1 c. of olive oil! Did you all do this? And you had a good result? The chicken would be swimming in oil! I used a little olive oil (maybe 2 TBS?) along with a TBS of butter. #4 - Flour is not needed. #5 - Mozz cheese should be shredded, not 'fresh' for best melting result. #6- Don't put fresh basil on so early. It will burn - leave it for the last 5 min or use dried. Now, with these changes, the dish was delicious - but I guess it is now my own version of chicken parmesan.",

The WHOLE famiily loved this, and every recipe gets easier each time its' made, right?\nI only used 1/2 the Panko. I didn't use the crumbs sparingly either. I only put 2 c in, and had the other 2 c in a bowl in case they were needed. I cut the chicken breasts in half before using the meat mallet. The fillet seemed too big without doing this, and it was easier for someone to have a second helping. I used Barilla Roasted Garlic sauce. I Loved the sifter for the flour; that worked great!\nGiven that I had twice as many fillets, next time, I would probably use half the oil, so I could have clean oil and maybe do the chicken in 2 batches. (I also used paper towels for excell oil.)\nAs much as I loved this recipe, given the calories/fat, I would not make it as often as I'd like.\n10/2012- Just made this again for Sunday dinner, the family LOVES this recipe! I skipped/forgot the provolone this time around and used shredded mozzerella. Even though it's not as crispy, I made sure to have enough for leftovers. Also- use paper towels to collect extra oil after frying. TIP- If you buy chicken in bulk, then cut, trim, and pound with mallet before freezing for later use, this saves lots of time during actual recipe.",

Then transfer breasts to breadcrumb/Parmesan cheese mixture as made in step 4, pressing the crumbs into both sides.\n\nI now use this method for virtually all recipes which call for breading, including fish, pork, veal, etc.  It is easier and less messy than using flour, eggs and milk to bind the breading to the meat and I have found that it works equally well.",

My goal in writing this review is to let Members know that just because a recipe has a thousand hits/reviews, does not always mean its the best. I followed this recipe for the most part, however, made a few changes. I substituted regular bread crumbs and a jar of Classico traditional sweet basil. This turned out amazing! I used the entire jar of sauce because I served it over penne pasta. I put a thin spread of sauce on the bottom of the pan prior to placing the chicken inside. This recipe will definitely be a keeper and I won't hesitate to forward this recipe on to others. What a treat!",

I'm writing this review and giving my rating provided that I followed the directions of the recipe exactly as stated. I don't like reviews where people make a bunch of changes then rate \"their\" version. No thanks. This recipe is absolutely fantastic. There is not much more I can say. I have four kids ages 2-8 and they all loved it. I would stress the importance of pounding the chicken between the two plastic bags. It sounded strange to me but it makes a difference. Give yourself lots of time to make this meal. Its time consuming but worth it. I served it over angel hair, with sides of steamed broccoli and garlic bread. Yum!",
