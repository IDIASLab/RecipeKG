First - add the lime juice carefully and taste. You'll need more or less depending on how sweet your pineapple is. My pineapple was pretty tart and the addition of lime juice (in that quantity) made the salsa a little too sour. Also a little seasoning is in order. Salt and pepper the filets before pressing in the seeds. Otherwise it's a solid recipe and very light.",
