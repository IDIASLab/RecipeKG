I decreased the milk by 1 cup and added a can of cream of celery soup instead, along with 1/2 cup of evaporated milk.  This turned out fantastic and got rave reviews at my weekly gal's poker game.",

Instead of the ham I substituted prosciutto which added a richer flavor to the dish. I used a can of cream of celery soup and condensed milk in place of the milk as suggested above. I felt these changes made this a more appropriate dish for supper. I'll try it with the ham and leave out the asparagus another time for a brunch.",
