I let the butter soften, but I found it did not mix in at all with the milk mixture, no matter how long I beat it with my mixer. Next time, I will melt the butter. Also, it didn't cook in the alloted time--I think this is because I'm at a high altitude (5000-plus feet). I went to the Bisquick Web site and they had the same recipe with slightly different/smaller measurements to fit in a 9-in. pie pan. (I used a deep square dish for this recipe, which worked fine and didn't overflow.) The site also said for high altitudes, adjust the heat to 375 degrees. Next time, I will probably just use the recipe on the Bisquick Web site. Just a note for high-altitude bakers--the Bisquick Web site actually connects to the Betty Crocker Web site, and it appears that all their recipes have high-altitude adjustment suggestions.",

I found the 'crust' batter to be very thin but proceeded, as I remember another reviewer commenting the same thing.  After about 5 min. in the oven it started to ooze over the side of the 10 inch pie dish.  To save my oven I just put a cookie sheet underneath to catch the drips.  It took about an hour to bake at 325.  The crumb topping is wonderful.  I added 1.5 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  The spices were perfect, the apples were done perfectly, and the taste is very nice.  I am whipping up some cream for the top to serve to co workers.  I just had to try a small sliver to make sure it was presentable.  Very easy and quick recipe, also nice because it uses ingredients one has on hand.  *I also melted the butter for the 'crust' batter, but kept the butter in small cubes for the crumb topping.  thanks for this nice recipe.  It's different, not your average pie, cobbler, or crisp.",

Note that in the recipe there are 2 separate entries for Bisquick--the \"crust\" uses the 1/2 cup...the crumbly topping uses 1 cup of Bisquick. The recipe when printed up combines the recipe for the \"crust\" and the \"crumbly topping\". Be careful. I used an 8x8 square pyrex dish which I filled with about 3/4 with the apple chunks.
