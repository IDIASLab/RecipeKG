HOWEVER, I must add a small remark: this recipe is NOT KOSHER.\r\nI don't keep kosher, but I should explain why: any mix of dairy with meat is forbidden for all religious Jews. since the matzo balls in this recipe are made with butter, they are dairy. if you want this recipe to be kosher, substitute the butter with butter-flavored shortening, just make sure it's kosher, and non-dairy. enjoy.",

I made my own chicken broth (used only chicken necks celery carrots onion and water) on Saturday strained the broth refridgerated it for 2 days so it could mellow out and then followed the recipe for the matzo balls. They are awesome! I used the Manishevitz Egg and Onion Matzo crackers. Maybe that was the clincher. Im feeling like im catching a cold today so this was the perfect dinner to have. Plus I have leftovers for a couple lunches! My 3 kids and husband also really liked it. THANKS OMA!!",

Considerations: I used olive oil instead of butter 5 finely processed matzo instead of purchased matzo meal and my boxes were larger 16 oz boxes so I used 20 matzo out of 28 available in 2 boxes. I would add a third large can of chicken broth because as it was my matzo balls only had room to pile up. I would also try using a scoop with a release like an 1/4 or 1/2 cup ice cream scoop. I boiled them for a half hour and they were perfect. All hail Oma.",
