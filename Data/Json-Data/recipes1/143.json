But here are a few tips from my experiences...I do not use margarine, I use only real butter--the flavor is much better.  And they must be baked until they are a deep golden brown in order to not be sticky and to have that nice crunch--I've found that's about 20 minutes for my oven.  10 minutes has never been long enough for mine.  The topping needs to be poured as evenly as possible across the crackers (I usually pour thin streams back and forth in all directions)...it will then settle nicely into an even layer when it bakes.  They are delicious, and they are always a hit when I make them.  I have used only graham crackers for mine, so I can't rate the club crackers.   ",
