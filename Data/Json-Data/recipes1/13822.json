Instead of the microwave I used the oven: 350 for 45 minutes (don't put them too close together or the sides won't cook). I toasted some rice bread (wheat allergy) and put it in the cuisinart to make crumbs - they were the best part! Kind of a chunky coarse crumb topping instead of super fine crumbs (had about 1 cup total). Poured all the left over crumb mixture over chicken before cooking. They held a lot of the butter (used about 1/4 cup vs 1T) and got crunchy-toasty in the oven! SUPER RECIPE! Amazing flavor! Smelled fantastic while cooking! Presentation is company-worthy or nice for an everyday meal! Don't leave out any of the spices - the combination of them all is what makes it! Thank you for a new favorite! We'll be talking about this one for a long time!",
