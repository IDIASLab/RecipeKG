Thanks for a wonderful recipe. 12/23/2000...I made these in jars for Christmas gifts except I did not include the nuts in the jar. I noted the nuts in the card for the recipent to add when mixing. All recipents that have baked them have enjoyed them. Thanks again..",

If you bake this recipe at 350 for 30-35 minutes in a cake pan it come out gooey on the inside and has the texture of a pecan pie. If I had made it before giving it as a gift I would have changed the cooking temp and time on the directions. This recipe tastes so good warm or refrigerated. I changed the recipe a little by using 3/4 cup butterscotch chips and 1/2 cup nuts. I recommend this recipe to anyone.",
