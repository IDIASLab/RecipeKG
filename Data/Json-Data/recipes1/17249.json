I didn't need the entire chicken - I had about 2 cups left over. This ages well and we thought it tasted even better the next day. We also thought it was missing something crunchy maybe a little celery or some water chestnuts would give what we're looking for and a little bit of salt would also add a nice balance to the sweetness of the chutney. The second day we sprinkled some toasted almond slices on top and that really added a nice crunch and a nice extra flavor. Thanks for this recipe. I never would have come up with this on my own. Yummy!",
