                "reviewBody": "A couple of pointers if you're considering trying this recipe for the first time. ICING-1.) Make the icing FIRST.  You're essentially making candy (creamy caramel) with this icing, which means it will be very hot when done.  It takes a LONG time to cool to spreading consistency.  If you make it first and then put it to the side, once your cake layers have cooled, it will be ready to spread.  2.) For a nice texture, cut the chopped pecans in a food chopper to small pieces.  3.) Is my icing thick enough?  Don't follow the 12 minutes exactly. Instead, stir constantly and remember, think candy.  Once the sauce has thickened and begins to come to a soft-rolling boil, it's ready.  It should have a creamy caramel look and coat the spoon completely when you dip it and take it out.  4.)  Use room temperature egg yolks and mix them well.  Cold egg yolks may curdle and cook.  You'll see them, they'll be the yellow pieces of rubber swimming around in the sugar mixture.  CAKE-5.) Use cake flour and sift the dry ingredients together (take pride in your cake!).  6.) The same ingredients will make and frost a 3-layer 9-inch round cake.  7.) This is a light & moist cake, so remember that the layers will crack easily.  Don't worry, just use the icing to \"spackle\" it back together.  Your guests will be too busy licking the cake off ",

The sponge is light and moist. The frosting is yummy and I had to be careful not to eat it all before it went on the cake. Just a word of warning make sure you seperate the egg yolks really well for the frosting. I got a little white in the mix and ended up with boiled egg type lumps in the frosting. Fortunately they were big enough to pick out and didn't spoil the frosting. The recipe is a little fiddly compared to a standard sponge and take a little while but the texture makes it worth the time investment. I would recommend making this recipe.",

I bake mine in 3 9-inch round pans for approximate 30 minutes. I do make one tweak to the icing though. I always wondered why my mother-in law's cake turned so much better than mine since we used the same recipe. She finally told me her' secret'. Add 2 oz. of the Sweet German Chocolate squares to the frosting. It makes a world of difference. One more thing since there's just 2 of us we can't eat the whole cake so I cut it into individual slices freeze them on a cookie sheet then vacuum seal the slices. Works really well and we can have a slice of cake when we want it.",

                "reviewBody": "I made two of these for a large birthday party. I incorporated some changes with each in order to experiment and have some words of advice as a result. I compared the two cakes with the changes and here are my best recommendations: 1. I made my frosting first in order to give it time to cool to spreading consistency. 2. I also added 2 oz of melted chocolate to the frosting for a deeper flavor-this made an amazing difference. 3. I toasted my pecans and coconut at 350 for 15 min 4. I increased the amount of chocolate in the cake to 6 oz 5. It is extremely important not to over-mix the batter from the point of adding the flour mixture. I did this with only one of my cakes and it was dry and crumbly-the other one was moist and delicious. 6. I do not think the chocolate on the top was necessary and did not add to the the overall taste of the cake. I also came across an interesting fact while researching: German Chocolate Cake has nothing to do with Germany. It is an American creation. Sam German was a 19th century chocolate maker. In 1952 General Foods the makers of Baker's chocolate used his name when creating the recipe which was originally called German's Chocolate Cake. Overall this recipe is delicious and with the changes that I incorporated it was incredible.",
