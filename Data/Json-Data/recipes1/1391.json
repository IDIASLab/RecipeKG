It also lacked any depth and texture. \nAfter making a small batch, I remade the recipe.  In place of water I substituted a 50% mixture of skim milk and fat free 1/2&1/2.  I also reduce the almond by 1/2 and substituted vanilla for the other 1/2. This made for a thick and rich finished product that was much better than the original recipe(as several people can attest).  The only other change I will make in the future is to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup, and reduce the cornstarch to 1-1&1/2 Tablespoons because with the new recipe it came out more like pudding.",

It was an easy fix--I just mixed a small amount (1/2 tbsp) of cornstarch with some milk added it to the custard and continued to cook it. The second time I was more careful with my measurements and the custard thickened beautifully. I'm so glad it's full-proof! It's a delicious custard that I used to fill a white almond cake found on this website. If you love almond-flavored foods you'll die when you have this.",
