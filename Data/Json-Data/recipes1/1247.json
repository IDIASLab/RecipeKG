I alternate this recipe with another wheat dinner roll recipe (that needs to be kneaded:) and this one is perfect for those days that you want fresh yeast rolls but don't have time to let them rise before baking. When you let them rise in the fridge overnight just use a lint free dampened towel that will prevent air from coming in. These turn out perfectly browned when you watch the oven closely. They get brown fast so around 8 minutes be watching for the perfect shade of golden-brown. Thanks for a great recipe and a staple at our house!!",

I follwed the recipe to the T even using a brand new container of Fleishmans yeast and it came out a tad on the dry side and didn't rise all that well but it did have a pretty good taste. I think that rising on the countertop is the only real way to make bread by hand without worry that it is going to dry out which is what happened to me. I think I will give this recipe 1 more shot and keep the dough outta the fridge.",
