Some have to bake for more than an hour and others are less than 45 minutes. In my oven these were done on top in about 35-40 minutes but were not done in the middle in just one or two very small areas. Next time I will turn my oven down just a tad and keep a close eye on them. For those of you who need to bake more than an hour personally I think these are worth the wait. Me and my husband fell in love with these. The mix of choc chip cookie and cheesecake is PERFECT. Although not kind to the waistline these will definately fix any sweet tooth cravings. These should be called \"Death by Chocolate and Cheesecake\"!!",
