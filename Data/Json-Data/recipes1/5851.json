I also added a little more carrots and added a green bell pepper (chopped). ALSO I grilled some chicken seasoned with cajun seasonings cubed it and added that too! VERY GOOD! Not too spicy but a nice \"warm.\" Instead of salsa I sprinkled some sharp cheddar cheese overall. Would make again! Thanks Corwynn for another great recipe!",
