I'm used to English tea biscuits that are sweeter or more like scones so here's my modifications: I used 1/2 c. of butter instead of shortening, added 1/2 c. of sugar, 1/2 c. of raisns, and 1/4 tsp. of active dry yeast. I didn't knead the dough or cut it. I just dropped it onto the cookie sheet by tablespoons.  They baked up nice and brown.  If you add the raisins just butter them, if not just add butter and jelly and serve with tea!  ",

We ate these with soft butter and strawberries preserves but I think that honey would be devine! They were a bit flaky on the outside and very tender on the inside. A bit bland alone but a very good base for something sweet on top. I also bet they'd be good with sausage gravy.",
