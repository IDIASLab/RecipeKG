If you use a food processor for the crust, its a snap.  My only recommendation is that you multiply the custard ingredients by 1 1/2 (ie. use 3 egg yolks, 3 cups milk, etc.) since the filling did not really fill my pice crust, which was 9\" not 8\".",

I can;t stand the reviews who say, I added this omitted that, and it was terrible. How you know?, you didn't make the recipe. That said, make sure you follow the advice of making the filling X 1.5. Unless of course you want to add a topping like Meringue (which my wife's grandma does) Don't worry about the consistency, it firms in the fridge. Overall a very good recipe.",
