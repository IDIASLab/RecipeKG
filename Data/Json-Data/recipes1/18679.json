I bought mild pepper jelly and when I make these again I'll have to add some chili paste to it to make it hotter. I was thinking that if the hot jelly is red that it would make a really nice appy for Christmas by using both kinds. I did use my food processor and the mixture came together well and handled well. I got 16 thumbprints using my small cookie scoop. The directions were right on except I did let them bake for two minutes longer after putting in the jelly. Talk about an easy appetizer! Thanks so much for the recipe because I'll be sure to make these again!",

I took the advice of those who added some additional spices (garlic powder salt and paprika). This is a quick recipe and the final product looks very attractive. I also had to bake them for about 2-3 mins longer. The only pepper jelly that I found at the grocery store was an amber color. When I first opened the jar I was a bit nervous that it wouldn't look appetizing but since the cracker is golden the amber colored jelly looked \"sparkly\". I would absolutely recommend this appetizer and have shared the recipe with several friends. Next time I may try the suggestion of the brown spicy mustard and hot sauce. Yes there will definitely be a next time!",
