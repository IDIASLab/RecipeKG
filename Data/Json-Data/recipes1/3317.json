I think the recipe should say 'roll to 1/8th of an inch in thickness' as opposed to 1/2 (which would give you really thick cookies). Sometimes the dough is too dry to roll easily- feel free to add as much cream as necessary to get a dough of good rolling consistency- otherwise the cookies will have a tough texture. Also MAKE SURE to prick the cookies! One time I didn't and they blew up like balloons.",
