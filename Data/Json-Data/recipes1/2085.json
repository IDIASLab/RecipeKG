There were only 2 differences. One, this recipe is half the recipe we made. The second is that all the ingredients were cut in half except the flour. The class recipe called for 3 cups of flour. Here it calls for 2 cups instead of 1 1/2 cups. That is probably the reason people are saying it's dry--too much flour.",

I don't think you should rate a recipe 5 stars if you had to make changes to get it there. That's just saying the original recipe wasn't worth 5 stars in the first place, and all those reviews about changing this or changing that were completely confusing. I think I would rather find a blueberry muffin or cake recipe that is worth 5 stars on its own.",

I followed previous suggestions: increased milk to 3/4 cup, used a 9\" springform pan, and put half of the topping on top of the fruit layer. Instead of fresh berries, I used a 15 oz. can of Oregon blueberries (drained) which works really well.  Alternately, a can of drained peaches tossed with 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and some sugar also tastes great.  I find that the cake tastes best when warm, so zapping it in the microwave the next day for a few seconds does the trick :-)",

Firstly I screwed up b/c I baked it in a 9 by 13 pan and misjudged the measurements - I thought 1.5 times the recipe woudl be sufficient but it wasn't - next time i'll try double the recipe. Also I used canned peaches sliced thinnly instead of blueberries:) I did put half the streudel in the middle - so then there wasn't enough on top - so the top layer came out swirled with the cake batter. My friend had some and said it is his FAVORITE out of everything I have ever baked including cheesecakes cookies cakes pies!!!!!!! (I bake a lot - have made maybe 50 different things from this website:) But keep in mind that's b/c he doesn't like overly sweet desserts chocolate and adores cinnamon and peaches:) Also I made it low fat and low cholestrol by using \"I can't believe it's not butter in place of butter fat free milk and eggbeaters:) (b/c all my friends are complaining i'm making them fat with all my baking) and it turned out so well...i think it just gives it a lighter cake - not as dense and rich:) A definitely must try if you love fruit desserts!:)",
