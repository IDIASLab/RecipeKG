                "reviewBody": "11.4.18 Caramelized the onions for an extra 10 minutes and they were beautifully golden and sweet. Had my doubts about the addition of the apple cider and doubtful that I ll add it again. Guess we re just too traditional but we didn t care for the sweetness that the cider added to the overall flavor of the soup. The caramelized onions added enough sweetness for us but that could be personal taste so I wouldn t want to discourage anybody from trying the recipe exactly as written. Using the food processor to slice the onions made this an extremely easy recipe to make and with its few ingredients and relatively short cooking time compared to many other onion soups this is really good. No wine in the soup? Nope I didn t miss it and I m a wine lover. This is a solid recipe and I ll making it again using all stock probably try beef broth next time. Thanks for sharing your recipe we enjoyed it I ll add a photo the next time I make it. UPDATE 11.9.18 Made this again today using beef stock instead of chicken and apple juice (1/2 cup adding just a little sweetness) instead of cider. My husband liked the beef stock better but I thought the chicken worked equally well. That s a win-win because either will work. Also instead of just parmesan today I topped it with a traditional crostini with mozzarella more like the traditional french onion soup and then under the broiler.",
