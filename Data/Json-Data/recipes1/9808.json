I agree with one of the other reviewers that this recipe should not have made it to the \"All Recipes Tried & True Favorites. I've learned the hard way that one should check the reviews. But I thought that since this recipe was in All Recipes \"top 300 recipes\" that I was safe and didn't need to check the reviews...boy was I wrong. I knew there was a problem when the recipe said the topping was supposed to \"spread evenly over the apples\" because what I had was a congealed ball of dough that I had to rip into little bits and drop on the apples. And when it baked they turned into little rocks. My Husband being the sweet man he is didn't complain but he had to drown it in milk to make it edible. I now know to always and I mean always check the reviews before trying a recipe!",

I did not notice any of the previous complaints; I cooked it for the 30minutes and although the crust was \"golden brown\" it was a light brown and I could see the apples bubbling so I considered it done. The crust was soft not hard like others complained maybe they cooked it a little too long? If you eat the crust by itself I guess I can see why it was called \"bland\" but if you eat it like your supposed to with an apple it is delishous! I still like the traditional oat apple crisp better but this one is a very tasty desert. It is a little sweet but apple crisp is supposed to be! Plus I used Gala apples.",

The crumb topping was the best I ever had - I was a bit leary on the egg use in the topping but it turned out wonderful. I scaled the recipe for 12 servings and probably added more apples as I did not measure the apples. Enjoyed by all at my dinner party and even though everyone was stuffed from supper they could not resist cleaning their plates of this apple crisp with icecream on top! Definitely will make over and over.",
