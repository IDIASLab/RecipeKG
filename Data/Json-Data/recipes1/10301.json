I substituted the butter for 1/4c unsweetened applesauce, only used 1 egg, halved the sugar to 1/4c, increased the wheat bran to 1c and used 1/2c each of wheat flour and all purpose flour.  The sweetness was just perfect for me (the banana gives a lot of sweet flavor) and so moist!  Each muffin turns out to be about 100 calories, so we're free to munch on them guiltless!  The first batch I made used only 2 bananas and 1/2c applesauce, this was a little dryer than using 3 bananas and 1/4c applesauce, but still good!",

(I know it's not wheat bran but with us being on such a tight budget I have to use what I got.) Thanks for the ingredient search I was able to use a small amount in this recipe. I cut the butter back by half and added in a quarter cup of homemade organic applesauce. I used buttermilk whole wheat white flour and omitted the nuts only because we didn't have any. I did add in a heaping half cup of organic raisins to bump the fiber and fruit. I got a little more than 12 servings--12 regular sized muffins and 12 mini-muffins. These turned out moist flavorful and just all around good! I might be able to cut back the sugar next time too. My bananas were really ripe so my muffins turned out a little too sweet. This will make a nice snack/treat for the next day or two. They're quite good so I can't imagine they'd last long.",
