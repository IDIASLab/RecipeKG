Having said that, they're good, with a nice peanut butter flavor--but with so many other recipes out there, I wouldn't call this a \"must make again, to die for recipe.\" I frosted them with Chocolate Frosting I, which made them twice as good as they would have been otherwise.",

I made the recipe as is, but made a peanut butter icing in order to make it extra special! I used 2 cups of confectioners sugar, 2 tablespoons of milk, 2 teaspoons of corn syrup and 2 full tablespoons of peanut butter. It made the brownies sweeter (the way I like them) and added even more peanut butter flavor! I'll definitely be making these again soon!!!\n",

I cut out a big square in the middle so just 2\" all around the edges is covered w/foil, so the edges are AS chewy as the middle.  I double this recipe and it takes about 35-45 min to bake.  I just wait for it to spring back as indicated and be a nice golden color (check the very center b/c that's where it will be gooey if not done).  I add eyeball amount of chocolate chips on top before baking which I think is goodness. Or you can melt a chocolate glaze/frosting on top after it's done which also tastes delicious.  I freeze the leftovers but definitely make double the amount using the suggestion of doubling all ingred. but adding 1/3C MORE pb, 2T LESS butter, and 1/3C LESS flour (so 1C + 2/3C).  Excellent each time!",
