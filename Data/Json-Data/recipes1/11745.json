I then introduce the mushrooms, let them cook down and add the marsala wine.  Once the wine comes to a boil, I put the chicken/veal back in the pan, spoon the mushrooms and wine over the meat, cover and simmer so that everything combines.",

Add 1/2 of the butter, a couple of minced garlic cloves and fresh groud pepper along with the mushrooms to the pan and brown it all. Then add the wine and remaining butter, reduce it and put the cutlets back in to simmer until tender. I also substitute thin sliced pork cutlets to keep the cost down.",

Veal is a lean and tender meat that requires a very brief cooking time even if you use veal chops as I did. Marsala a fortified wine comes in two forms sweet and dry. While either is acceptable in this dish I prefer the dry as I don t care for the added sweetness especially as the wine cooks down. (Whichever you choose just be sure to use real Marsala not the cooking variety found in the grocery aisle.) Additional spices herbs or garlic are not necessary in this dish and would only distract from its pure and simple flavors. Seasoning the meat with salt and pepper and cooking just until done is key and requires careful attention. Because this was just for the two of us I didn t care to make a special trip to the store for the small amount of mushrooms I needed (leaving town AGAIN this time to Minneapolis for Thanksgiving dinner our son is preparing!) so I rehydrated some dried porcini mushrooms. I used some of the soaking liquid in the sauce which along with the addition of the optional heavy cream resulted in a rich luxurious and highly flavored sauce without overshadowing the delicate flavor of the veal. (Note: unfortunately veal is very expensive both pork and chicken however are fine and more affordably priced substitutes)",

I used canned mushrooms since that was all I had. I seasoned the flour with adobe seasoning and then floured the veal. Cooked the veal in the butter and oil for about 2 minutes each side - removed veal. Quickly heated up the mushroom in remaining oil and butter then added lots of marsala. Added the veal back into pan and cooked for 5 minutes more covered. Removed veal (kept warm) and took another submitters advice and added some heavy cream to the sauce and heated until thickened. My gosh that is good stuff. I served it with Parmasean Pasta (right from the box!) and spooning that sauce over the already rich Pasta and the veal was sinful. Thanks submitter.",

Then I took them out put the mushrooms in the pan first then laid the scallopinis on top while putting the heat on low. I simmered the mushrooms for about 7 minutes then about 4 additional minutes after the marsala was added. Thanks for a terrific keeper recipe!",
