Taste was pretty good but I think this would greatly benefit from the addition of some snow peas or some thinly-sliced red bell pepper anything to give it a pop of color. Followed the recipe except for using fresh ginger root (just because I had it on hand) instead of ginger powder. I used small bay scallops instead of large sea scallops and served over basmati rice. Certainly was super easy to make and I m going to give it one more try adding some additional vibrant/colorful veggies.",
