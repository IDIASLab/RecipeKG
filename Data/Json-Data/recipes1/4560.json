READ the recipe: the \"crust' is cream cheese, flour and butter...  no sugar (made me doubtful...and I was right).  The crust is tasteless.  Its not flaky, its crumby and crumbling.  This might be better with a traditional pie crust.   The filling is caramel and evaporated milk - cant argue there, its good.   But the worst part... is the frosting.  I have NO problem with fatty or shortening buttercream and what not.  But I did not care for this icing.   Again, look at the recipe - its only half a cup of sugar with a cup of shortening.  A traditional buttercream would  have a shortening to sugar ratio of 1 to 4  ... not 2 to1.   The icing is tasteless and greasy.  I dumped an extra cup of sugar in it,  and it still just tasted like shortening with a gross oily mouth feel.  I'm an experienced baker - I did not care for this recipe.  Sorry Tania.",

Cut both with a Pizza Cutter Roller or although maybe you can use the Athens shells which may result in a slightly bigger cookie if so just bake accordingly and enjoy! The ICING or any icing made with granulated sugar with a liquid & Crisco. The sugar should be added to warmed milk (liquid) so it dissolves & then left to cool before adding the other ingredients or visa verse this prevents the icing from becoming \"GRITTY\"! If you don't like this ICING you could USE YOUR FAVORITE but any ICING should really be piped on with a pastry bag or corner of a baggy making for a prettier cookie! You can make these Even More Festive & Delicious by Sprinkling with your choice of finely chopped or ground nuts colored sugar candy decorator sprinkles or a little grated chocolate. I worked with a guy whose Wife made these put them on his cookie tray to bring to work it was the first time I ever had them and I was wowed! I wasn't the only one they were the first to go & she had quite a variety of Christmas Cookies & lots of them on his tray! They have been on my tray ever since! A little Bit of Work (a lot less using Athens Phyllo Fillo or the PepperRidge Farm's Puff Pastry - rolled thin or your cup will close but well worth your EFFORT! Happy Holidays to All and to All Happy Holiday Baking!",
