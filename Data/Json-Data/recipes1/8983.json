The last two times my pie has marbled and I think that letting the cream cheese chill in the pie crust until very set is a GREAT idea. Also pouring the top layer on extra careful would definately help. I just wanted to see if anyone else had this problem. OKAY...as far as everything else goes I LOVE this pie. I double the streusal layer and today I added about 2 tablespoons of flour to pumpkin mixture to help it set a little better. This seems to do the trick as I am usually baking this pie WAY longer than recipe says. I would just plan on leaving the foil on at least an extra 15 minutes so your crust doesn't burn if you need to contine baking pie.",
