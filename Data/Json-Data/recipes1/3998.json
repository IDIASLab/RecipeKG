This recipie is very authentic. I too have reduced the amount of W'sauce as the first batch was a little \"fishy\". Wife loved it kids liked it as well. I have found a new \"Soup and Sandwich Lunch\" staple at the Hawke house. Just a note: they originally used Coors beer (in the 70's anyway) not dark beer. I made it with both and the results while completely different are both delicious! Thanks for bringing back wonderful childhood memories!!!",

My grocery store doesn't carry Cheese-Whiz so I used a 16 oz bar of Velveeta instead. Coors was my beer of choice. The soup was easy and fast to put together and absolutely delicious. Two friends have already asked for the recipe. Will definitely make again.",
