This wasn't quite as good as another potato soup recipe I tried from this website but was still excellent. I used this recipe to inaugurate my new food processor which works great. If you still don't have one consider buying one! It sure beats chopping all those vegetables when you are in a hurry! I picked this recipe because I had all of the ingredients without a trip to the store. Without any added spice to speak of I expected a soup that was a little bland. Surprisingly it was very tasty.
