I double everything and bake it in a 9X13 glass baking dish, and instead of using the buttermilk biscuits, I use 2 cans of cresent rolls/ 1 can unrolled will fit the bottom perfectly, and the other for the top crust.  Before filling with the meat mixture, I bake the bottom crust about 5 minutes first.  I also added some cumin and ceyenne pepper just to jazz it up some, and often use a variety of cheese, whatever I have on hand at the time.",

I will make one change though, I will defninitely pre-cook the biscuits until they are ALMOST done, then I make the recipe.  2nd time I made this, the top layer of biscuits weren't quite done underneath (the middle ones), and I don't think I'll leave it to chance.  This is a very versatile recipe.  I added a layer of cottage cheese mixed with shredded cheddar and it was delicious!!! I highly recommend this recipe!!!!\r\nI also recommend making them with the \"grands\" rolls as they are so good and flaky!!! leftovers?? what leftovers???",

The chili pepper and sour cream were wonderful.  Instead of can biscuits, I made my own, split the dough in half, rolled out the first half pressed, it into the bottom of an 8 1/2x11\" glass pan, then added the meat mixture, more moz. cheese over the meat, then rolled out the second half of dough, pressed it over, added the chedd. and moz mixture over the top, then drizzled the remaining of the second can of tomato sauce over the top.  Baked for 25 min, and when it came out it looked like a magazine cover.  It was awesome!  The crust, top and bottom turned out perfect. The husband said it was so so good and is a keeper for sure!",

I didnt have any sour cream so that was simply omitted. Even though I added tomatoes I also added the tomato sauce. I used Mexican cheese but only on the top. I forgot to put some in the beef mixture. (oops)And when I cooked the ground beef I added minced garlic instead of garlic salt. This was a good dinner that my husband liked more than I did. Next time I will try Grands biscuits since the ones I used were too small and just didn't give enough crust. I will make this again and probably do it the same way as I did tonight.",
