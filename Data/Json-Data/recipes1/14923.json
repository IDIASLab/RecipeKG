I tossed the broccoli with garlic olive oil, plenty of garlic (we love garlic so I doubled the amount), kosher salt, pepper and a few shakes of crushed red pepper. I covered w/ foil for the 1st 10 min then removed the foil and let cook another 20 min or so tossing the broccoli occasionally. I finished it off with the squeeze of fresh lemon (we used extra). My husband and i loved this so much we made it 3 nights in a row. Make extra!!!\nEDIT: In the years since finding this recipe I've made this probably 100 times,we love it that much. I've made it with the broccoli the recipe calls for but we've also made it with asparagus, zucchini and fresh green beans. I've made it in the oven but we also found these veggies turn out fantastic on the grill (we have a grill basket which prevents little pieces from falling thru the grates), the green beans do turn out best on the grill. Its a great way to use up summer veggies and also nice to be abe to do the whole diunner on the grill in the summer and not have to turn on the oven when its hot outside.",
