                "reviewBody": "I just made the cheese filling and added it to a pre-made gluten-free crust in a 9 inch pie pan. It made more than I needed so I poured the leftover filling into 4 holes in a muffin tin, filled the other holes 1/3 full with water and baked it. I left it cooling in the oven for hours and hours. It still felt a bit warm after a very long time so I let it finish cooling to room temp on the counter and then put it in the fridge to chill for many more hours. There was only the tiniest little crack near one edge. It is delicious! Instead of putting some leftover graham cracker mix sprinkled on top I just grated a bit more lemon zest over it before I put it in the oven. I am going to serve it with whipped cream that has a little lemon juice and lemon zest added. Someone commented that it wasn't lemony enough...slathering lemon curd over top would help that. Yes it isn't super lemony but I like it. Berries and whipped cream would be perfect.\nFYI: I had the cheese filling that baked in the tins in the oven just as long as the cheesecake. These fell once they cooled but were still tasty and could be removed from the muffin tin without much loss of filling sticking to the edges of the pan. Its possible the water in the 8 muffin tin holes helped created steam to prevent the cheesecake from cracking. I have read that helps.",
