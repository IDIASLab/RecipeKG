I sliced up 4 apples (3 honeycrisp and 1 gala) into a pan with 1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 cup sugar, 2.5 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. cloves.  After sauteing for about 15 minutes on medium heat, I poured over the crust mixture in the recipe.  I took this to my sister's for Thanksgiving and it was a great hit.   Other than boiling over in my oven, I was really happy with it.  The original recipe did not specify size of pan so I used a 9\" pyrex pie pan and it did not accomodate the apple/crust mixture.  I'll use a bigger pan next time because I thought the amount of apples was appropriate.  Overall, I thought this is a creative way to make an applie pie without having to make a standard pastry crust.",
