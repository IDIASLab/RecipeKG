Salad lovers should enjoy this recipe even if they don't love broccoli. I like that it can be easily modified using a variety of dried salad dressing mixes--and that you can make dry mixes to suit your own tastes. I think will be trying a ranch vinaigrette version made with homemade ranch mix next.",
