When i was a child we would use \"Cranberry Almond Crunch\" cereal in place of some of the oatmeal, and it turned out EXCELLENT.  And we under cook them a little so they are still soft and chewy - yum!  This was an excellent recipe though, but I adapted it and added cranberries instead of the raisins, and it reminded me of younger years!  Everyone loved them!",
