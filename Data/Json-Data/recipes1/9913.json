My whole family loved it! Most of my kids wouldn't eat Manwich anymore so I was really hoping that they would like this. For 2 1/3 lbs. ground beef, I used 6-7 Tbsp ketchup, 3 Tbsp mustard, 1 1/2 Tbsp worcestershire, 2 Tbsp vinegar, 3 Tbsp honey, 3 Tbsp brown sugar, 1/2 cp finely chopped onion, 1/2 cp finely chopped green pepper. Seasoned with approx. 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and black pepper to taste. In skillet, brown hamburger and drain. In seperate bowl, mix all wet ingredients & brown sugar until blended. Put onion and gr. pepper in skillet, add mixture and drained hamburger and mix well. Heat on med-hi until hot (about 5 min) then turn down and simmer for about 20 min. Stir occasionally.",
