Used 1/2 tsp additional cinnamon, a little vanilla, about a spoon full of vanilla yogurt (I thought it looked a little dry), and left out the chocolate chips, nuts, and raisins. A keeper recipe.\n*edit* Just made these with a small chopped up apple (about a cup).. it is a wonderful replacement if you don't use raisins. I also added a dash or two of cloves.. these are still one of my favorites to bake :)",

I made them as written it doesn't say how big of a spoonful to drop them on the sheet. I made them rather large like I always make oatmeal cookies but they spread out a lot! I wound up with 6 pancake size cookies that fell apart! I added another 1/4 to a 1/2 cup more oats to the remaining dough I just eyeballed it made smaller cookies but they still spread out quite a bit. I put the remaining dough in the fridge for an hour or so added 2 minutes cooking to compensate for chilling the dough. They were perfect! Only other subs I did was use pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg still used the 1 TSP cinnamon and I only used raisins. I also drizzled them with a maple glaze. Powdered sugar milk and some pancake syrup didn't measure those ingredients but it's good on just about anything! Thanks for the recipe!",
