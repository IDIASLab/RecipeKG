More or less beer depending on pan size, # of brats and thurst of the cook!  Put brats in beer sauce and let simmer. Brats will stay juicy and flavorful for 2-3 hours.  great for picnics, ball games, camping, etc...",

I may take it up a notch when I serve it to my guests who happen to like spicy food.  Just an f.y.i. though... without the sauce it isn't very hot for those who may not like heat.  Thank you Zach! ",

I pricked the brats all over with a fork to allow the beer to get in there. Some of it could be the beer... all I had was Beck's which is pretty light. Great idea though I will keep tweaking to get more beer flavor. I used a couple cloves of fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.",
