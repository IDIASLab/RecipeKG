The amount of vegetables you put in depends on how thick you want your soup. We like lots of veggies. This soup can be pureed and served with croutons on top. Great for a cold night supper. You can really let your imagination get carried away with this soup. I don't make it the same every time. It depends on what is in my fridge that is left over. Meat or chicken can be added.  Enjoy",

Finally I make bisquick dumplings and cook them on top. It is an all evening affair - good for winter nights and a nice movie. you will have leftovers for a week.",

Rather than dumping everything together I started the pot with a little bit of broth added the onions and let that cook while I was chopping up other veggies. I went from fresh raw veggies to soft canned ones adding to the pot as I chopped and increasing the amount of broth (just enough to cover everything and kept it boiling). So by the time I had added everything to the pot the soup was practically done. I let it all cook for 10 mins to let the flavors combine. Wonderful.",

I will cook the potatoes first then when they are half done I will add the rest of the veggies for 10mins so they don't go too mushy. I would leave out the wax beans use red bell pepper instead of green and add more chickpeas and cauliflower. This is a delicious healthy soup and will join my rotation:)",
