I accidentally only used 1 (8 oz.) tub of cool whip and I'm very glad I did since the recipe calls for 2.... it would have made for way too much cool whip which was already overpowering the dish. In the future I'd also add a little more coconut since 1/2 of a 3.5 oz package is very little.... in fact I couldn't even find a 3.5 oz package.... the extra coconut might help to sweeten it up more which will allow for less sugar to be added. After making the changes the recipe was delicious and everyone gobbled it up!",
