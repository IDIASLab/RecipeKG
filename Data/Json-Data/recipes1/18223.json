We use rabbits that were hunted in the great Southwest desert during rabbit season. However, a lot of local stores sell rabbit as well. The 'wild hares' here are smaller and leaner than their supermarket counterparts, so I use two smaller rabbits and adjust the cook time during rabbit season or one large rabbit in the off time.",
