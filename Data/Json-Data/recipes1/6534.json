I added sliced fresh mushrooms and a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic because of other reviews that said the sauce needed to be more tomato-ey.

I would suggest simmering for longer than \"until heated\" - about 20-30 minutes - to avoid any crunchiness from the dry onions.",

It only takes an additional 5-7 minutes of prep time, but it makes all the difference in the world.  Another secret of mine is to use Worcestershire Sauce while browning the ground beef and I sweat the onions and bell peppers in 2 tablespoons of Olive Oil before adding the meat to brown.  This makes the meat so much more flavorful.  Oh, and I would omit the water and add a teaspoon of sugar to cut the acidity.",
