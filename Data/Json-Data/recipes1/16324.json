I also finely minced the ginger and added that to the dressing instead of to the cabbage.  To be honest I didn't really measure the peanut butter - just a big scoop, the dressing is nice and thick and clings to the vegetables well.   Thanks for a great recipe!",

Then I let it sit for an hour as the recipe called for and ended up with asian slaw soup. It was a sloppy, soggy mess that was not very appetizing. If I make this again and I probably will I will serve it right after I combine everything. UPDATE: I made this again last night and realized what probably went wrong for me. Last time I made this I julienned all the vegies and probably dressed the salad too much. This time I coarsley chopped everything and watched the amount of dressing I used and no more soupy slaw! I even let it sit for about 30 minutes and it was perfect. Tasty recipe!",

This salad \"grew\" on me. It starts out OK but then I found myself going back and going back. I think next time I will leave out the salt in the dressing. I think this will make the dressing taste a tad sweeter and allow the ginger to come out more. Salt can always be added in later if desired. Thanks for the idea!",
