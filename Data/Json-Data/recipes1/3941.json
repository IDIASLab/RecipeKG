The apricot flavor of the pie was very intense - unfortunately - the sulfur taste had intensified also. I love apricot pie so I put the pie down the disposal and tried again using unsulfured apricots. I had to adjust the amount of water and simmering time because unsulfured apricots are hard and dry as well as being dark. The filling was charcoal grey which I could have lived with but it was also bitterly intense. I wish I could have made it work but I won't try this recipe again unless another reviewer has a suggestion which might help.",

Apricots were also a bit dry from me leaving the lid off too long when stirring so I added the juice of one small Meyer lemon. Apricots I used were home-dried Blenheims and thus a bit sweeter and drier than most store-bought would be so the added lemon was a good idea. Flavor is excellent but a bit intense for a whole pie. Would recommend this as a perfect filling for small individual tarts.",
