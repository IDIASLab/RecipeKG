I reduced the unsalted butter to 1/3 cup, added 2.5 cans of clam juice (out of the 4 cans of clams) instead of the requested 2 cans of juice, used marsala wine instead of the requested dry white wine, put in about 1/2 tsp each of salt and pepper, put in a little extra garlic (I was using \"ready to use\" minced garlic)and used small shell pasta (all we had left) instead if linguine.  I simmered the sauce on medium electric heat until the sauce was about 1/3-1/4 left, making it a nice consistency (about 20 minutes).  I also served the dinner tossed in decorative bowls instead of plates to allow the sauce to soak into the shell pasta while eating.  This dinner will be repeated in the near future! Hope these suggestions help!",

I used whole baby clams which I added in for the last 4 minutes of cooking they will be extremely tough after id you cook them the whole 20 minutes. I did drain half the juice as directed & ended up grabbing a bottle of clam juice & using half of it next time I simply will reserve all the liquid. I didnt have white wine so I used cooking sherry. Red wine vinegar will also work just as well for an emergency white wine substitution. Finally I used thin linguine & topped with asiago (which is a much better choice than parmesan for a dish like this). This was outstanding a new family favorite!",
