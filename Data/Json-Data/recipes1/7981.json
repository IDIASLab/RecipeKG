The marinade was tangy and I loved the texture of the salsa topping. The ingredients are a little expensive but once you buy the two bottles of liquor you may use them again and again for this recipe or cocktails hehe. For the reviewer that stated that the fish was dry you shouldn't marinate it for longer than the recipe states (and then give a bad review). Fruit juices and/or liquor are known to \"cook up\" fish such as ceviche.",

Adding variety to the standard fried-meat-and-potatoes local fare can be challenging. This recipe fits the bill. You'll never see a grouper in any of our local grocerey stores but we do occasionally get talapia (sp) and that works well. We also also use it on bonless chicken breasts and its wonderful! Its a great meal on a hot day because its light and the chilled salsa sets it off.",
