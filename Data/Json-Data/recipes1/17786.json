After I finished the step of caramelizing the onions and adding the peppers I poured that into the bottom of the crockpot placed the browned chicken thighs on that and then added the stock artichoke olives and sausage stuffed peppers. Took about 2 and a half hours on high; would probably take at least 5 on low. Thanks again Chef John!",
