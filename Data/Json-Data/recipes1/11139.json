Thank you A SIDE NOTE: I have made this recipe quite a few times since my review. Two points to add, one is that another famous BBQ restaurant in NC is Gardners.  This recipe is fairly close, but perhaps more vinegar and hot than Gardners version. The second point is now I use this recipe as a way to use up my left over pork roast. I chop the meat into cubes and simmer on the stove top until meat begins to break down and vinegar is just about gone.  LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!",
