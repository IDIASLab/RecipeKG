Something that might help with the \"runny\" issue that some have commented on is making sure that your squash is well drained. I cut my squash in half lengthwise, scoop out the seeds and then slice into chunks. Those pieces are then cooked according to the directions and drained in a colander with a plate or bowl on top to press out excess moisture. The core of the squash tends to hold a lot of water and, in my opinion, the seeds have a bitter taste. Also, adding a beaten egg to the sour cream/soup mixture helps the whole dish to set up. Instead of putting melted butter into the dish, I save it for drizzling over the Italian dressing seasoning (that I mix with about a half cup of Italian breadcrumbs). This combo makes a nicely browned, crusty topping that is a nice contrast to the creaminess of the rest of the dish. I've also been known to use sauteed bell peppers (any color) if I'm out of pimentoes.",

Even when I fix squash, I put it and chopped onions in a little butter that I've melted in the skillet, put a lid on it and let it steam until almost done, I then remove the lid and let it cook until the water evaporates. You never should add water to squash, because as it steams, it makes it's own water.Also to add water, makes it mushy and takes away from the flavor. Vegetarians can add cr of mushroom, celery, or a cream soup of their choice. I also try to avoid packaged mixes with MSG, or preservatives and add my own spices. Hope this helps.          Paula P.",

I usually substitute low fat sour cream Health Request cream of chicken low fat butter and half fat cheddar cheese (I use Cabot brand from Sam's Club). Great taste without the coronary! I also buy matchstick carrots to save some time and often throw in other veggies or ingredients on hand. In the past I've added mushrooms red bell pepper (instead of pimento) fresh basil and even blue cheese (leaving out some of the cheddar). As for the problems people mention with it being too runny I've never had that problem. I always cook it about 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe states (I live at 4500 ft.) so maybe that's why it sets up better. Otherwise I suggest adding a bit more sour cream or cheese. I suppose you could also add more cream of chicken but I don't love condensed soup mixes. Enjoy!",
