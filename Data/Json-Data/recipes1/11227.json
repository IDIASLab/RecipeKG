I used flavored bread crumbs instead of plain.  I cooked them on one side for 20 minutes and then turned them over and drizzled honey on them and cooked for another 20 minutes.  They turned out juicy and delicious!  Very similar to the lamb I had at a beloved Morroccan restaurant in San Francisco.  Will definetly do again!",

As other users suggested, I used half soy and half worcestershire sauce and marinated the chops in the egg mixture for about 1/2 hour before cooking.  I also used seasoned bread crumbs and added garlic powder and a bit of fresh-grated parmesan to the coating.  I baked for a total of about 35 minutes and the chops came out wonderfully tender and flavorful - really delicious!  I will definitely make again and may try this same mix on pork chops as well. Just to update this review - I used this recipe with pork chops this week and it was great! The first time my baked pork chops have come out tender and juicy!",
