Per other reviewers, I did the following:  replaced the shortening with butter/margarine, used 1/2 tsp baking soda + 1/2 tsp baking powder, used skim milk in place of half-and-half  for the glaze, and I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the glaze.  I spooned the glaze into a ziplock bag and chilled it in the fridge for 15min while I let the cookies cool.  After the cookies were completely cool, I cut a corner snip off the ziplock bag containing the glaze and squeezed it to pipe lovely designs onto the cookies.",

I used margarine rather than shortening as margarine tends to help keep cookies from spreading out too thin. I also grated my apple (used 1 large Granny Smith), and squeezed most of the juice out. Lastly, to keep the cookies from spreading out due to the extra moisture in apples, I added about a half cup of rolled oats. The glaze is perfect with milk and a hint of cinnamon, and these cookies are to die for! I cooked them on 375 for 10-11 minutes. Oh, a secret to a good cookie is to use parchment paper rather than greasing your cookie sheets. This will be a new fall staple in our household! Thanks for the great recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great tasting soft cookie, cakelike rather than crispy.  They remained soft even after leaving them out awhile to let the cookies cool before glazing.  The cookies also stayed out on the racks to let the glaze harden so I could pack them safely in a container to give to friends (I kept a few for myself, just for scientific purposes), and the cookies still remained soft.  I always enjoy reading member feedback, and went with the following suggestions:\nused equal parts shortening and butter, coursely grated one Granny Smith apple, and reduced oven temp to 350 adding a couple of extra minutes for baking.  I don't eat much salt, so I went with a scant 1/2 tsp, used pecans I had on hand instead of walnuts, and used golden raisins instead of regular raisins.  I liked the idea of a decorative glaze, but really the cookies are sweet enough without it.  I made a thick glaze, put it in a small ziploc bag, and snipped off a tiny corner at the bottom of the bag. Starting at the center of each cookie, I squeezed out a spiral design.  The cookies look nice and it minimizes the amount of glaze so it doesn't overpower the cookie.  I made the amount of glaze per the original recipe, and only used about half of the glaze.  Thanks for sharing a very good cookie recipe that stands out in the crowd.  It's nice to find a recipe that uses fresh apples!",

I didn't increase any spices as I normally would. I baked at the time/temp specified and it worked well! Bake just until they lose their sheen...they will look like they are darkening but it's the spices trust me. I also normally use a cookie scooper for a perfectly round cookie but liked the rustic look of the chopped nuts and apples. I orginally wasn't going to frost them because they are SUPER tasty without it... but decided to do it just to follow the recipe... WOWZA! A very light layer of frosting/glaze knocks them out of the park! 5 stars for a GREAT recipe!",
