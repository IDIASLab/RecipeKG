Remember that you can always add more of one ingredient, but \"removing\" means adding more of every other ingredient.\r\nMy thoughts:\r\n1. notice the recipe starts with 2 cups of beans, not 2 cans (garbanzo beans are also called: chick peas or ceci beans\r\n2. drain and retain all the bean juice as you will want to add it later to get the texture to your liking (water will also work)\r\n3. tahini can vary in intensity, I recommend starting with about 3 TBSP and working up or down from there (Tahini can be identified by its bitter taste)\r\n4. start with 1 OZ of lemon juice and work up if you like your hummus more sour\r\n5. it\u2019s always best to add salt towards the end because some beans have salt in the juice\r\n6. garlic- what can I say about garlic- some people will say 1 clove, some people will say 12 cloves (I use 3-4 depending on size)\r\n7. olive oil is traditionally served on top, I blend 1TBSP in and pour more on top- olive oil is a \"good oil\" so don't worry about adding it\r\n8. paprika is traditional on top but won't add much heat, if you want some kick, blend in cayenne, jalape\u00f1os, or crushed red pepper (I use 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes)\r\n9. I consider cumin a necessity (start with 1/4 tsp and work up from there, I like 1 tsp)\r\n10. have fun- try adding roasted garlic, chives, scallions, roasted red peppers, olives, sun-dried tomatoes, or feta cheese",

However, we needed to make a couple of minor changes to get to this point. We used 2- 15 1/2 oz cans of garbanzo beans. We thought it was a bit too much tahini so we used slighty under 1/3 cup. We added an extra clove of garlic (at least).  We also added red pepper which is a staple ingredient in hummus so I was surprised it was ommited (not a lot- maybe a teaspoon or so).  We also agreed with other reviewers that you need some of the chick pea juice to thin it out just a bit.  We used 3/4 of a can of juice from one can of the chick peas.  My mother in law tells me that if you peel the chick peas (which is supposed to be fast and easy) it will come out better too- I don't think I will do this though because it tasted great just like this.  We also used a little more lemon than the recipe called for - it just depends on your taste.",

Cumin, tobasco or red pepper adds flavor. Roasting the garlic mellows it. Some add more cloves. Make it the night before serving so all the flavors meld. Indian or pita bread brushed w/olive oil, topped w/parmesan cheese, toasted in the oven and cut in wedges works well for dipping as does bagel and other chips, or crackers. Tahini can be hard to find - some grocers carry it on the peanut butter aisle. I go to a fun health food store called Manna Mills that carries it. Hummus is heart healthy and earth friendly. I disliked chickpeas as a child & recently learned to enjoy them (read the classic 'The Yearling').",

I've made gallons of this one, and lived next door to a Lebanese family in Georgia recently, the Dad a restaurant owner, who live on Hummus... and mine (this one) kicked butt!  Add 1/4 to 1/2 C roasted red peppers to the mix for color and flavor to die for.  Forget the blender.  If a blender works, it's too thin.  A big, heavy duty Quisinart will save hours!\r\nAnother tip:  Fill muffin tins, then freeze them, then put the Hummus portions in a bag in the freezer.  One cake, thawed, warmed a little, with 2 T Premium olive oil, sprinkled with sesame seeds, served with warmed pita bread is the way to go.  SOOooooo good for you!!",

Maybe I just had an especially sour lemon because that's all I tasted. Also a little too much tahini for my taste. I started with the original recipe and then kept adding things until it was edible. Added 1/4 tsp cumin another clove garlic and some roasted red peppers. Next time I'll try the Spiced Sweet Roasted Red Pepper Hummus on here.",
