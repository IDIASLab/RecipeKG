These Oatmeal muffins are more like what muffins started out to be. Simple (albeit somewhat bland) additions to a meal. I find that they are perfect in their simplicity, a wonderful base to a dollup of jam. The original recipe I had called for 1/4 to 1/2 cup of honey or molasses instead of sugar and was a nice 'non-jolting' way to begin the day. They are a good base to add fruit or nuts. I like banana with pecans; chopped apple and cinnamon; dates with extra molasses. Tailor them to your tastebuds, but don't mistake them for a cake-like muffin. These are much more substantial, and you won't be hungry in an hour.",

I use soy milk instead of regular milk (I use chocolate or vanilla flavoured, then I leave out the sugar in the recipe).  I use applesauce instead of vegetable oil.  Whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. And if I use plain soy milk, I use honey instead of the white sugar.  Basically this adds soy protein and fiber, while cutting down on calories and fat.  A delicious alternative to a store bought granola bar.",

The first time I followed the recipe exactly and had very nice muffins but I agree with some other reviewers that it was a little bland. The second time I altered the recipe beyond recognition still with good results. I wanted a morning glory style muffin using what I had on hand so here is what I did. For the oats and flour I used 1/2 c corn meal 1/2 c wheat flour 1/2 c wheat germ and 1/2 c all purpose flour. Instead of just milk I used 1/2 c pumpkin 1/2 c milk and finally instead of sugar I used pure honey. The result was a golden yummy healthy muffin not too sweet but full of flavor. This recipe is wonderful as a starting point.",

If you do this, you may want to spray your muffin cups with a little cooking spray so the papers don't stick to the muffins. I also added some cinnamon and raisins. I also decreased the baking time by 5 minutes, as recommended by another user. The texture and taste are great!\r\nThanks for offering this recipe:)",
