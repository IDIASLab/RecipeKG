Use 1 cup of water along with the vinegar for a milder flavor. The longer the pickled pumpkin is stored before serving, the better it tastes. Rescue all those poor Halloween pumpkins by doubling or tripling the recipe for pickled pumpkin throughout the holidays.",

Use pie or sugar pumpkins - they are smaller and in my area were labeled \"pie\" pumpkins. Carving pumpkins and pie pumpkins are NOT the same. Right after Thanksgiving the priced dropped by half. 2. I followed the reciped exactly. You might be tempted to cook longer than five minutes because the pumpkin will not be completely translucent. DON'T do it! 5 minutes at a rolling boil is just right. They will continue to get translucent after removing from heat. This recipe yields a sweet/sour flavorful crisp pickle. 3. 5 pie pumpkins = 7 lbs. of uncooked pumpkin and 8 qts. pickled.",
