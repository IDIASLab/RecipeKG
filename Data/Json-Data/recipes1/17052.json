It's nice and soft so after the sandwich is made you can press it down and dip it in hot sauce. YUM.",

Put it on Italian bread (I cut mine in slices to be more authentic) pile on some fries (not thin fries but not as thick as steak fries - homemade are best) then a vinegar-based cole slaw (not mayo-based). I used the Amish Slaw recipe from this site and it works great! Best sandwich ever!!!",

After a move to the Kansas City area a few years ago I started missing my Pittsburgh foods and have been making my own Primanti's sandwiches at home which is what this recipe is based on. If you have the time & equipment I'd recommend making your own fries -- better tasting IMHO. Secondly use a vinegar-based slaw/dressing if you're really going for authenticity. Lastly you can use any type of meat in this sandwich -- cappicola is one of my favorites as is steak with a fried egg. Now if I could only replicate Kennywood cheese fries at home.... =)",
