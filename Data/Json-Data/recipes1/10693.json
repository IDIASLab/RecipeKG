                "reviewBody": "I stuck closely to the ingredients list, only omitting the green pepper as it didn\u2019t appeal to me in fried rice. But I did change the cooking method quite a bit to produce a better result. For example, to add the carrots to the pan and cook them until crisp-tender when you\u2019ve already got the cooked shrimp in the pan, you\u2019d end up with some rubbery, overcooked shrimp! Also, fried rice should be started with cold, cooked rice.  So...I cooked the rice first, then spread it out on a cookie sheet and stuck in the fridge while I prepared the rest of the ingredients. I quickly stir fried the cold rice in the sesame oil, then the celery and onion, and finally the garlic (so it wouldn\u2019t burn). To that I added the peas and the diced carrots, which I cooked ahead of time in the microwave.  As for the egg, I cooked it like a crepe in a small saut\u00e9 pan, then rolled it up like a cigar and sliced it, chiffonade-style, very thinly, producing beautiful yellow ribbons of egg.  I tossed the egg in with the shrimp (I used frozen, pre-cooked salad shrimp), the chicken (already had some chopped rotisserie chicken in the freezer) and the ham (a pre-cut ham slice from the market came in real handy for this). Finally, I stirred in the soy sauce and a drizzle of toasted sesame oil. To die for.  The recipe suffers, however, from an instructed cooking method that does not bring out the best this recipe has to offer \u2013 therefore, four stars rather than the five it potentially deserves with a few changes.",

                "reviewBody": "First I never used recently cooked rice, i always use day old rice, which saves time. I also used SPAM, whenever I have it or cubed turkey bacon. I find that the flavors are much better for my taste. Also whenever I make fried rice, I always tend to layer my flavors with the ingredients.  So I start by cooking the eggs and then setting them a side. I then add a little oil to cook the spam or meat. I brown the meat slightly first, before removing it. Then i add onion and garlic, and slowly cook them, before adding the rice. I then cook the rice and the onion and garlic, so that the rice can absorb some flavor. I then add the veggies, and cook them slightly. At this point I add some taste, i use a little bit of soy and oyster sauce. I mix these a little bit more so that the flavors mix nicely. I then return the egg and spam to the pan. And then i mix them nicely together. After letting the flavors mix together, i end by adding a little bit of sesame oil. Only little bit though, you never want it to be stronger that anything else. I then finish by topping it with fresh green onions. And then it's done....\n\nI've grown up to eat my fried rice this way, my dad always made if on the weekends for breakfast, it was always a treat. He would also make some eggs and spam and we'd have a full on breakfast. Even though it may have had a high cholestoral count. But this is super good....:-D",

So... to get the rice right... you do have to cook the rice first (preferably a day ahead) rinse it and chill it. The rice should not be overcooked and needs to be chilled when making fried rice. Also the sesame oil is very powerful. I use only a teaspoon or two along with regular oil. In keeping the spirit of getting rid of leftovers add leftover bits of veggies or meats from the week. I always add beansprouts. Fresh is best but I keep a can on hand just in case I can't get to the market.",

So this is the order that Chinese chefs use - I looked at them cooking numerous times:  cook rice to half done, let it cool.  In the wok heat oil with garlic, add carrots and celery. If the oil evaporates during frying, add a bit of water for veggies not to dry or burn.  When veggies are almost crisp done, add shrimp and chopped scallions, soy sauce and a bit of hot sauce.  After shrimp is turned pink, stir in rice.  When rice is hot, stir in egg (uncooked!  not cooked like someone here mentioned yack!).  Oh, and it only takes 20-25 minutes to make for me, including chopping veggies.  Enjoy.",

I thought that would help for an authentic Asian flavor. Also, I like the flexibility factor of the ingredients. As recipe suggests, you can freely substitute for what you have on hand. I added scallions and garlic. And I used cut up beef hot dogs as the meat since it's all I had and I can't afford to use shrimp!! I omitted the celery since I don't often have it in my frig. I also made the rice a day ahead as I've heard is the best thing to do for fried rice. It came out very pretty to look at, and was very moist. My boyfriend says he would it eat \"again & again\" so I guess it's a keeper! The only thing I will do differently next time is possibly cut back on the soy sauce a little. Oh, one more thing...my boyfriend said it was better than his Mom's,  so I pretty much know that I've done something right! Thanks for the recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "There are several issues I had with this recipe.  Yes, technically, this is fried rice.  But, as has been stated in numerous other reviews, you should try to use rice that's left over, day old or longer.  It dries it out a little.  In a pinch, I have made rice, then spread it out onto a sheet pan and placed it uncovered in the refrigerator to dry for at least a few hours.  Certainly make sure you don't overcook the rice to begin with.  Another thing is that the shrimp gets very overcooked.  Cook it separately, remove it, add it back at the very end.  Sesame oil is not a cooking oil.  It's a seasoning oil. When subjected to high heat, it will burn easily.  And you should only use toasted sesame oil.  I add it with the soy sauce.  Fry with peanut, canola, or vegetable oil of some sort. Finally, there is no place in most average kitchens for medium-high or medium heat when stir frying.  Unless you have a very high output stove, (Almost nobody does at home) keep that burner on HIGH.  This is all supposed to be cooked as quickly as possible, searing and not steaming the food.  Don't overlook the recipe's suggestion to adjust the seasonings to taste.  Soy sauces vary in strength and salt content.  If the rice is too bland, add a splash of soy until it tastes right.  No salt is necessary because there's plenty in the soy sauce.  Black pepper is a must though.  Don't overcook the veggies and add some chopped green onions at the very end when you add the shrimp back to the rice.",
