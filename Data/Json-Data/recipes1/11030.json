I put the dough hook on warm the milk and honey, proof the yeast for 10 min., add the eggs and butter, measure all dry ingredients in a bowl and whisk to make sure distributed, slowly add flour mix in 3 batches.Then I knead with the standmixer 7-10min.To make sure gluten is developed take a golf ball sized piece of dough and stretch in opposite directions using your thumb and forefinger of both hand. If it stretches thin enough to see light through without it tearing right away it is ready.)Then I just followed directions for the rolls or I made loaves. Thank you again. Know my kids only want mom's bread and not store bought bread. We all had fun making it.",

If you are not using a bread machine, proof the yeast in the warm mil for about 10 minutes and then add the butter, egg and honey. Mix the wet ingredients then add the dry ingredients. I kneaded the dough with my stand mixer for about 5-7 minutes. I use my oven as a proof box by preheating it to 200 with a pan of water on the bottom rack and then turning it off and placing the dough in a greased, glass bowl, turn the dough over so the top is greased, cover with a clean, smooth fabric kitchen towel and let proof for about an hour. punch the dough down and shape into either loafs or rolls and place back in the oven to proof for another hour before baking. Hope this helps!",
