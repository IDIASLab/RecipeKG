Then I top it off with extra cheddar and some hot giardiniera. I find this to be a much more satisfying meal. I usually make enough to be frozen and reheated at a later date. P.S. ALL my friends RAVE about this!   I guess what I really transformed this into is a glorified chili but it's AWESOME.... ENJOY!!!!",

Because my DH isn't a huge fan of meatless, I added an extra can of chili beans to give the dish extra substance.  Not exactly sure about the beans, I bought a can of Bush's\u00ae Chili Magic (15.5oz) and Brooks\u00ae Chili Beans (15.5 oz)and used the listed amounts of all the other ingredients.  Because our 2-yr. old niece was eating with us, I had to use mild beans, otherwise I would have bought hot beans.  I didn't mix the cooked pasta in the dish as I knew there would be leftovers.  So instead, I served the beans mixture over mini penne pasta.  This is how I would do so, again.  I pulled a small portion out for our niece and then added cayenne pepper to ours.  I thought the non-cayenne pepper was good but we really enjoyed the spiced up version.  Cottage Cheese, fresh strawberries and French bread were served with the dish.  We have plenty of leftovers for lunch today.",
