I prepared it this Christmas along with gravy made from the pan juices and Spaetzle.  My quest for the perfect Christmas Pork Roast from my past has now been ended. The only change I made to the original recipe was the addition of garlic powder in the rub.  It was a huge hit with my family and I thank you so much for helping perfect my Christmas dinner.  I will use this recipe for the rest of my life and hopefully pass it on to my children.  ",
