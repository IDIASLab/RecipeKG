I made it once as written and then again by cooking the lentils only with the bay leaf and keeping the rest of the ingredients raw. I liked it much better with the fresh raw ingredients. I use about half the onion and garlic called for though. Love the fresh lemon juice and olive oil dressing and have at times sub'd out the lemon juice for red wine vinegar! Seasoning/spice can be altered to taste and additional fresh raw veggies can be added as well. I enjoy this salad and make it often. The plus is it is healthy and good for you!",
