Then add seltzer to fill the glass 1/3 of the way.  Stir the milk and seltzer.  Then add more seltzer until it reaches the very top of the glass.  Then pour 2 oz. of chocolate syrup down the side of the glass.  Only stir the bottom of the glass where the chocolate is sitting.  Stir until a foamy head appears and the drink has turned brown.  And it tastes nothing like a fizzy chocolate milk.  I hate chocolate milk but love egg creams.",
