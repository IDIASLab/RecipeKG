They ate every morsel and asked if I would make it the next time we have another dinner. I used a ready-made, frozen Mrs. Smith deep-dish shortbread crust. The only change I made was using Splenda rather than regular sugar. I don't belive it altered the flavor or texture in any way. This recipe makes enough for 2 pies however there really isn't enough filling for 2 deep-dish pies. Next time I make this I will make the filling as the recipe directs however I will make an additional half recipe to fill the pie shells. I also served it with Cool Whip. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful pie recipe. It's a new \"forever favorite.\"",

The second time I made this pie I pushed a dozen cherries down into the filling before adding the cheese topping.This gave it some extra colour and a little twist to the flavor.Delicious!",
