Sometimes I'll add a little maple syrup drizzle over the egg (minus the green onion) and it's almost like having a particular fast food's all-in-one breakfast sandwich. NOTE: If you have a cookie cutter or even a biscuit cutter you can cook your egg inside it while it's cooking in the hot skillet. Almost like having an egg form so that way it's a little more controlled and will fit a little easier. Just make sure to spritz your \"form\" with a little non stick spray.",

I pan fried the ham to pull all the water out of it. I baked the egg portion in my greased muffin top pan and it worked perfectly. I baked at 350 for 10 minutes. I toasted the English muffins first and let them completely cool before assembling. I think the key is letting all ingredients cool before putting the sandwich together. I wrapped individually in parchment paper and stacked them in the English muffin plastic bag to freeze. DH & DS microwave on high for 30 seconds flip and microwave for another 30 seconds. This is for using from frozen state. I'm making them again this weekend and going to try them with sausage. My family loves this for a quick breakfast sandwich.",

I used a slice of swiss cheese instead of the shredded cheddar which my husband and I really liked. I followed the directions for shaping the eggs into an omelette and then cutting it into pieces. I found it made the sandwiches bulky and uneven. Next time I might try using something that will shape the eggs into six even rounds.
