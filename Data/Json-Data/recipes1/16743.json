For the shortcakes, I froze the butter and grated it which is much easier. After dropping these onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and did an egg wash (one egg well beaten with 1 Tbsp. of water) and then topped it off with the turbinado sugar which provided a nice little crunch. These baked up beautifully and tasted wonderful. I served them with \"Easy Whipped Cream\" from this site. This recipe is a definite keeper!",

While the recipe does not require whipped cream, I did add it on the side. Going in my favorite recipe file.  Thanks Emmie4life for sharing your recipe here on Allrecipes.",

Tender, moist shortcakes with a pleasant crunch from the sanding sugar (did not have turbinado sugar). I will watch the baking time a little closer next time. Delicious at 15 minutes but I will pull them at 13 - 14 min when we have these again. I would also suggest making these close to serving time. The leftovers were not nearly as tender the next day. I am always looking for super fast, easy recipes that taste and present like you have spent more time preparing and this is a great example. Looking forward to trying all types of fresh fruit this spring and summer with this recipe. Thanks for sharing!",

I will not have enough strawberries for the number of biscuits (my own fault) so I added some homemade applesauce to the strawberries to stretch them out a little. No need for extra sugar this way and it is very tasty. I used a large ice cream scoop to scoop these into a mega muffin tin, the butter melted down the sides, collecting in the bottom, causing the whole outside to have a crunchy texture. Very good. I made a second batch subbing 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 plain yogurt for the buttermilk and added some sharp cheese. New Fav biscuit recipe.",
