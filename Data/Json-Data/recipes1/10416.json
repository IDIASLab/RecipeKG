                "reviewBody": "REVISED REVIEW:  Growing up Italian, I've eaten these kind of cookies for decades.  The cookie part is good but the frosting has too much butter.  Usually, there's either no butter or very little.  Without all of that butter, it's easier to frost and looks nicer.  I'm going back to using no butter but the cookie part is still tasty. Also, when it's warm, the butter in this frosting softens up (especially when you try to store them in a container) and they become a sloppy mess.  Typically, the recipe calls for just confectioners sugar, a tiny bit of milk, some extract and the food coloring. For those people who say the cookie is bland, it's not meant to be super sweet because it's meant to be frosted with the icing that is sweet.  If the cookie was too sweet, you'd be complaining that the frosted cookie was way too sweet.  It's a nice balance.  You can really use any extract you want to but usually it's anise, vanilla or lemon.  You can see my pic attached.  It was voted one of the top photos today!",

The frosting is wonderful too; I had run out of almond extract so I used all vanilla. I also put a couple drops of lemon extract in a portion of the frosting to change the flavor of some of them. They tasted so good. Definitely a keeper. I started making these all year long. They are great with the pure almond extract too. The perfect cookie for any occasion.",
