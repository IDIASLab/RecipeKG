I'm REALLY glad I did! The cake is great with the amount called for, but after trying more to see the difference, I definitely think 1 cup is the magic amount. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. I used the \"Buttercream Icing\" recipe (pictured) from Sharon on this website. Incredible together!",

I used a can of dunkin hines vanilla frosting and with this the cake was good.  However, after mellowing in the fridge for a day or two this cake was insanely good!  As good as any store bought or boxed mix.  Bottom line:  Make the cake a day in advance and let it mellow in the fridge overnight.  I see no need to buy another boxed mix again.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Oh, and yes, after the water step it will be very soupy but it will turn out perfect :D",

Vanilla/ \n3 C Powdered Sugar/ \n1/3 C Milk - \nMelt butter, stir in cocoa. Alternately add sugar and milk, beating to spreading consistency. If necessary, thin with additional milk.

Everything about it was nice, I did add a teaspoon of instant coffee to the boiling water and the batter was thin. Baked up perfect - I did line the tin and use oil spray. Tastes better than some expensive box mixes. Wasn't overly moist either, just not dry at all. Thanks.\nUPDATE: Up the amount of cocoa to 1 cup and make sure it's the best quality. I use a European brand. You can use melted butter if you run out of oil. You can use whipped cream, cocoa powder and icing sugar for a great icing.",

Been cooking cakes for over ten years this recipe is easy, moist,texture and elasticity is perfect for chocolate cake. The type of cocoa is crucial. I've cooked it twice, first time used a dark cocoa it was good but the dark chocolate enhanced the salt so it tasted a tad salty. So next time if using a dark cocoa will omit the salt.  Second time, used good quality standard cocoa and came out great. Also used a diluted espresso instead of plain water. Also glad the writer noted the runniness of the mix abit worrying at first. Excellent recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "This is not a good cake to make a layer cake with.  It is delicious, but it is more of a pudding cake, or a spoon type cake.  It would NOT come out of the pans, even though the pans were well greased before hand.  This cake came out in chunks...the kids had a great time eating the scraps, but we had to start over for my daughter's birthday cake.",
