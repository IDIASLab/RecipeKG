I looked in some old cookbooks and salmon cans used to be 16 ounces then, 15 something, and now they're 14 something.  (Trivia!)\r\n\r\nI loved the reviews, and joined this web site to do this one!  This is my first review, woo hoo! I implemented the sour cream and garlic salt suggestion.  I also added a little lemon pepper. I ended up adding another egg and some more bread crumbs to make them stick together better.  My bread crumbs were the \"Italian Style\" seasoned kind \"Vigo\" is the brand name with Romano cheese!  Mmmmm I buy the honking huge container from Sams club. \r\n\r\nMy batch made six hamburger size patties and I first tried frying them with a few squirts of Pam.  They got too brown before they got done all the way through = no good.  The next batch I fried in about a quarter inch of corn oil and they turned out great!  Well of course, because they were more fattening!  I drained them on paper towels and served them with cocktail sauce.  My husband said that his mother used to make them smaller and thinner (Hint hint!).  She was the best cook ever and as a wedding present she taught me how to make real biscuits and gravy.  (May she rest in peace.)  Anyway, next time I'll make 12 smaller thinner patties with the same recipe.\r\n",

If you're not a fish person (I'm definitely not), I'd suggest you buy the salmon that comes in a tuna-sized 3 oz. can.  I bought \"traditional\" salmon in a big can and was grossed out by it.  It literally looked like a salmon had been cut down to size and stuffed in a can, skin, bones and all.  I threw it away and couldn't bring myself to eat it. The little cans are boneless/skinless and look like the tuna I'm used to seeing.",

She then diced one or two hard boiled eggs and stirred them into the sauce.  I'm so used to having this sauce that I won't make the patties now if I don't have cream of mushroom soup in the house!",

Use Canola oil heated slowly and fry at medium heat.  Also, shred yellow squash & zuchini to the mixture.  Red pepper chopped adds color.  I served with wasabi mayo.  Wasabi is traditionally hot but added to mayo keeps it tame.  Some Asian markets sell there own version.  I prefer to make into rounded balls I think because it cooks so evenly and quicker than a patty.",
