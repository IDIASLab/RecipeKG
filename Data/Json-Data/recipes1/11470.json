I floured and fried up the chops before putting them in the sauce to thicken the sauce it also reduced the cooking time to about 40 minutes. I also used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 barbecue sauce. I added onions and 2 cloves of garlic minced up. This was great my husband and kid's loved it! I will definitely be making this soon:) Thanks for such a great recipe!",

I used 3 tablespoons of brown sugar and equal amounts of the Coke and ketchup (a little more than a cup)and added a few slices of onion on top of the chops. I took the chops out at the end and thickened the sauce with some cornstarch and water. It was not too ketchupy for us and tasted great over rice. This was so quick to throw together and then fix the side dishes while it cooked. How simple! Thanks for sharing this recipe - I will definitely make it again...and again..",

I served it up with roasted potatoes (put in the oven at the same time and ready at the same time) and peas and corn. I'll definately make this again.
