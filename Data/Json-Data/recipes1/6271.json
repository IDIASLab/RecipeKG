I didn't add the peppers because of the kids but I think they would add a lot of flavor as they are a tad bland without. That's ok though they were meant as an accompaniment and were perfect for that. I used butter instead of shortening (personal preference). They were fast tasty easy and very much enjoyed! I will definitely keep this recipe-it's a great recipe as is but I can imagine adding herbs or different cheeses etc. Thanks so much!
