The differences I made were \n(1) I didn't have c. of shrimp and couln't find @ store, so I added 1/2 cup heavy cream and 3/4 minced shrimp & crawfish (leftover from the crawfish boil the night before.) \n(2) I added about a cup of shredded parmesan.  \n(3) I added paprika and cayenne \n(4) I only added 8 oz. sour cream (got that hint from the previous reviews.)\n(5) I added about 3-4 tbsp of lea & perrins.  \nOkay so I made several changes, but it turned out fabulous.  I baked in oven after heating to give slight crusty top at 375 for 15 mins.  It was bubby, shrimp, cheesy goodness!  Went EXTRA well with fresh crusty french bread!  Great recipe!",
