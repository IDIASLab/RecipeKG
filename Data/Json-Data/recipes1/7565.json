There is a big problem with the cooking instructions -- it says to add the dairy to the soup directly but if you do so it will immediately curdle and clump. That can be avoided by simply taking a bit of the hot soup liquid and mixing it with the dairy in a small bowl and then adding it back to the soup.",

Using a hand blender or food processor blends the bacon and onion as well, which really helps with the flavour, especially getting that right amount of salt. I usually remove several cups of the potatoes once cooked, blend, and return to the pot. That way there are still some chunks of potatoes left. Also, avoid rinsing your potatoes after cubing them, as the starch will help the soup to thicken as well.  Great recipe!",
