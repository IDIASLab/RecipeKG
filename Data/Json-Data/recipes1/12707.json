We ended up with an amazing thick-but-smooth perfectly spiced red sauce! Just spicy enough to be interesting but not too hot to eat. I used this with a copycat recipe for Taco Bell enchiladas and the results were 100 times better than any fast food place or restaurant! The sauce really made the meal and a half recipe made enough for 5 large enchiladas (and we used a lot of sauce). Truly this is a must have for any Mexican or Tex-Mex meals we make in the future!",

I have started to do a couple things different to make it healthier. I use fresh tomatoes instead of canned. For step 1 I toss all the same stuff into a blender. I do saute the onion and bell pepper. After I combine them all I don't cook them on the stove. I put the cold mixture onto the enchiladas and just heat it long enough to make it warm enough to eat It is quicker and easy. It also uses less heat so it doesn't kill as many nutrients.",
