Perfect go-along for soups and as another reviewer suggested... good also for dipping in marinara sauce. If you want to get a bit more fancy you can use pizza dough and prepare a paste of fresh garlic and olive oil mixed with the rosemary and a bit of parsley. Brush it on after baking... the flavor is exquisite. Thank you Sandy B.",
