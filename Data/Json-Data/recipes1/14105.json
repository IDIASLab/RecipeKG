If anything make it as a dip not in rollup form. Sorry to be so negative.",

I also couldn't find the Fiesta Style Ranch dressing pckg so used regular. Used lite cream cheese and lite sour cream (NOT fat free!) Since some other reviewer's mentioned the filling was runny after slicing I let my salsa drain in a colander for a few minutes before adding to the filling( I used the fresh refrig. salsa)and that eliminated the problem of too much liquid in the filling. Also used Joseph's Lavosh; the rectangular shape worked well for spreading and rolling. Refrigerated the rolls in plastic wrap for 3 hours then sliced about 1/2 inch thick. They turned out very attractive and tasty. I'll make these again maybe adding some other veggies!",
