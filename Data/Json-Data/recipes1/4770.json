Also added 2-3 garlic cloves to the sauce.  I would stick with fresh basil for best  flavor - it really does make a difference.  Scrumptious!",

I used a whole 14oz can of chicken broth, 1 cup of Parmesan, 1/2 cup fresh basil, and I kept the cream the same at 1 cup.  When I made this, I let the sauce boil for 5 minute or so, constantly stirring it so that it wouldn't burn, to thicken it up a bit.  This made the perfect amount for an entire box of penne pasta without being too thick or too runny.  It was incredibly tasty, and I'll definitely be making this again!",

I served this over egg noodles.  I didn't have chicken on hand and used pork cutlets and it was just as delicious.  I also added garlic and scallions to the pan while cooking the pork (chicken) and also added a clove of crushed garlic to the cream sauce.  (I substituted light heavy cream instead of regular heavy cream which didn't seem to make any difference in taste at all).  EXCELLENT !!!!!!!!!  (it made me look like a chef in the making)    :)",

I modified it a tad, starting with using the standard breading method of flour, egg and (seasoned) bread crumbs.  I browned the chicken in a mixture of butter and olive oil to reduce the burning point temperature.  Once I browned it thoroughly I cut into it and noticed it was still a little pink on the inside \u2013 no problem, I just threw it in a 325 degree oven while I prepared the sauce and cooked some pasta.  While I only made two chicken breasts, I hated to waste the better portion of an 8 oz. carton of chicken broth and half a carton of cream, so I thought what the heck, I\u2019ll use it all!  I added the chicken broth to the pan first, reduced it drastically, then added the entire carton of cream and let it go until the sauce had reduced to a thick and velvety smoothness.  I added the Parmesan and pimiento just before serving and topped the chicken with a basil chiffonade rather than stirring it into the sauce.  The chicken was tender and moist, the coating dry, golden and crispy (rather than mushy and soggy), complemented by the luxurious, rich sauce.  The pimiento was a nice touch, subtly enhancing the sauce.  I\u2019m glad I had the extra sauce - it was perfect for some nice pasta!  Since this is a dinner a little on the rich side, I chose to serve it with just a few pattypan squash, lightly seasoned with butter, salt and pepper.  At the risk of sounding corny, this was a GLORIOUS dinner.",
