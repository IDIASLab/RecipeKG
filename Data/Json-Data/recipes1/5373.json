I mixed all of the spices, olive oil and lemmon juice and rubbed it under the skin of the chicken and then over the top of the skin and poured the remainder in the cavity. I put about 3/4 cup water in the bottom of the pan and baked the chicken upsidedown with the breasts in the juices. I covered the whole thing in foil and in 2 hours the flavorful meat was falling off the bones. My company raved and everyone ate way too much. Served with baked apples, green beans and fresh bread.

I just mixed all of the seasonings with the oil (doubled for a 5 lb. chicken) and brushed over the chicken. Stuffed the cavity with the spent lemons, a quartered onion and a few cloves of garlic. In the end, I added a few Tbsp. Wondra flour to the drippings to come up with a delicious lemon-herb gravy. This recipe is a true find... thanks so much, Barbara!",

                "reviewBody": "With my few changes, 5 stars! I used a 6 lb. roasting chicken which took 2.5 hours at 325 in a high-sided large aluminum pan. I doubled and mixed all the seasonings together using my own herbs for the Italian seasoning. I added 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice and no olive oil. Instead, I mixed it all up in a 1/4 cup of melted butter and refrigerated until the butter was fairly solid. I lifted the skin of the chicken and applied the chilled and seasoned butterbits directly to the meat, saving some for the skin. After rubbing the rest of the butter into the skin, I also sprinkled on more garlic powder, salt and pepper. The only thing I used inside the chicken was half of an onion, 4 chopped garlic cloves and the lemon skins. Baked breast side down and tented with foil in 1/2 cup of broth for an hour at 325; the second hour I turned the chicken over and placed baby red potatoes around the chicken with no foil tent. I did not need more broth, but you should add some to keep the taters moist if needed. Check often, don't let it dry out! The last half hour I poured off most of the broth, turned the oven up to 400 so the skin of chicken and potatoes would crisp a little. Very Very good! You know it is done when you can practically tear off the legs and the juices are clear. If you are starved, the wings get done early, rip em off and have a taste-test! Thanks Barbzal!",

I used 1/2cup lemon juice for the juice of 2 lemons & coarse ground black pepper. I also let the remaining (after rubbing some inside) dried spices sit in the lemon juice to rehydrate then whisked in the oil & used a pastry brush to apply it. It smelled great & tasted good.
