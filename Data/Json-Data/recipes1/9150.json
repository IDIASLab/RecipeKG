This reciepe has been in my family for years too, only we crumble cornfalkes really small and put them on top, then melt about a half stick of butter and pour it over the whole thing. It never turns out soupy, maybe those who said it did, added milk to the soup? It does need a short setting time of about 10 minutes, but it should turn out perfect! Try O'brien potatoes for some extra zest!!",

I make it with just the potatoes, sour cream, and cream of chicken soup, along with black pepper and garlic powder and serve it all the time as a side with beef, chicken, or pork.  I also make the original recipe with cream of potato soup (instead of chicken) and add chunked ham.  It's awesome!!  Thanks Adel.  (I always leave off the butter.  It's just not needed).",
