The only reason I didn't go with 5 starts was because I did add salt and pepper to the potato flakes (my only alteration) and without that, it would have been bland. Next time I may add a bit more seasonings too. This chicken comes out nice and crispy. I had the family pack of legs so I put 14 legs on one cookie sheet (and yes, there was enough butter and potato flakes to cover 14 legs with some to spare) and they were too crowded and didn't brown on the sides as much as I would have liked. My fault. Be sure to leave enough space between each leg so they can brown nicely. OH, AND BE SURE TO LINE YOUR COOKIE SHEET WITH FOIL FOR EASY CLEAN UP. That wasn't fun to was even though I used PAM. Thank, I will make again!!!  ",
