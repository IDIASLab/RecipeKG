I did make some modifications by cutting the potatoes in half removed the filling and mixed it with sour cream gorgonzola as well as some cooked bits of chourico and couple tbsp of garlic cream cheese. I stuffed the potatoes with the filling and baked them. Afterwards I topped it with caramelized onions and they were absolutely amazing. Thanks for a great base recipe!:)",
