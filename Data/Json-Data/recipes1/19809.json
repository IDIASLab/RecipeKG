Go easy on the salt, there is enough in the beef stock.  Served it just like in the picture!",

Next time I make this, however, I will be sure to serve over potatoes or Colcannon as this only made enough for one meal for my 4 person family.  Also, my 7-year-old turned her little nose up at it because of the intensity of flavor - which I think could have been dodged had I served it over mashed potatoes.  We enjoyed it (except the 7 year old) but afterward decided that since it's such a very flavorful stew, almost like a gravy, some sort of mashed potato accompaniment really is a must.\n\nAnother thought: I did use beef stock instead of chicken (beef is what I had on hand) and I wonder if using the chicken stock could have dialed down the strength of the stew.  Going to go that way next time.",

I made it the next day for my family, again using this overcooked, smoked brisket and it turned out just as great! THIS is DEFINITELY a keeper!! (I didn't use any sugar.

I doubled the recipe just so we can have left overs and followed it to a 'T' except I didn't measure out the s&p, just generously seasoned the meat with both prior to browning. I also added diced mushrooms and thickened it up a little with flour whisked with water.  Served over garlicky red mashed potatoes (see pic) and with the Irish Brown Bread from this site.  Even my daughters raved about it!  Personally I thought it needed a little more salt so next time may try it with beef stock instead.  Love Chef John's recipes!!!  :o]",

Paired with a nice Cabernet sav , some irish soda bread, some champs (mashed potatoe w butter and scallions) and followed with Eton Mess and a Warm Hug hot chocolate w irish liquor ) some irish music in background, we could've been there.  Cooked for 10, and 8 of us left, not a spoonful left as everyone had heaping seconds.",
