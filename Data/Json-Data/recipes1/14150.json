I was worried that there was not going to be any sauce but the eggplant and tomatos disolved and I only added 1/2 can of coconut milk at the very end along with some spinach. Very good but not quite mind-blowing. Oh- I also peeled the eggplant and soaked it with salt for 1/2 hour first then rinsed it and used it as it came from my boyfriend's mothers' garden and I was worried it was a little bitter. Yum- we will probably try this again.",

I didn't have eggplant so added 1/2 a head of cabbage and 3 small zucchini. The combination of spices really works and I added about a teaspoon of garam masala. I will definitely make this again you can throw just about anything in it- cauliflower potatoes chickpeas and green peas sounds like a good combination for next time.",
