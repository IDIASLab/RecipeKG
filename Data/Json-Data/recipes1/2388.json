I didn't use the butter nuts and almond extract as a filling instead I spread Solo brand almond filling on each rectangle and then rolled them up. Also I sliced each rectangle into 6 rolls. (for a total of 24 rolls made) I would think slicing them into only 3 per roll would make them too big for me. I prefer a smaller roll since they are quite rich. Watch the baking time. By making them smaller they took less time to bake. Make sure to turn the pans over RIGHT AWAY when taking them out of the oven. The brown sugar mixture hardens quickly if you don't and it will be difficult to get out them out of the pan. After they were baked I sprinkled the sliced toasted almond on top of the glaze. They looked really pretty and were so tasty! You will love them.",

Instead of placing the butter/brown sugar mixture into the muffin pan I spread over the crescent rectangles and rolled up as directed. I realized my mistake at that point but had to keep going so cooked them that way. They did not cook over and were really tasty. I mixed the powdered sugar/butter mix and brushed over the cooked tops. Would have thought I'd done it right they were so good. I used vanilla extract instead of almond added cinnamon to the brown sugar mix and did not put nuts in as the kids won't eat cooked nuts.
