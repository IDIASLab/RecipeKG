I added cranberries and rasins one time, and also loved that.  I did replace the white sugar with the brown, and sprinkled extra brown sugar on top before baking.  Thank you for the recipe.",

I, after having noticed that my applesauce was 'expired', used 1 c. of ripe, mashed banana instead.  Wow, what a great texture.  I don't think I'll ever use the applesauce!  I used 2/3 c. turbinado sugar in place of the white sugar.  I lowered the amount of water to about 1/3 c., thinking the bananas were a little more runny than applesauce would be.  I did use all whole wheat flour and it worked wonderfully.  I chose Healthy Heart Blend cereal from Fiber One and it was great!  I also used fresh blueberries since I had just gone picking!  An absolutely wonderful muffin recipe I will use and share over and over again.  Thanks so much!!!!",

I have altered the recipe: I use 1 cup all purpose flour 1/4 cup wheat flour and 3 Tablespoons ground flax seed and 1 Tablespoon wheat germ. The museli I use has nuts and dried fruit in it but I still add more dried cherries or blueberries. The boys know they're healthy for them and still they consume mass quantities.

First of all instead of the 1/3 cup of oil I added an additional 1/3 cup of applesauce and I didn't use the 1/2 cup of water because it would have made the batter to liquid. I used 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg because I didn't have any allspice at the moment. For the muesli I used my own homemade granola. My family loved them!

For the muesli I used Sunbelt Cinnamon Raisen granola because it wasn't very good and wasn't going to get eaten as cereal. I baked this in 2 loaf pans for about 30 minutes and sprinkled a bit of granola on top of the loaves. They came out very moist and had tons of flavor to them. It is a bit crumbly because of the granola but it's really really good.",
