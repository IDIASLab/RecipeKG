I melted margarine in pan, 2 cans of peaches- but only 1 can of juice-I sprinkled about 1 tsp each of cinamon and pumpkin pie spice on the peaches. Poured peaches over margarine and sprinkled 1/4 cup light brown sugar. I used flour and 1 tsp baking powder,sugar+ milk,2tsp vanilla and a pinch of salt.Wisked together and poured over the peaches and around the sides. Placed a baking sheet under dish, for drips. Baked @ 350* for 30min and then 400* on the top shelf for 20 minutes. Take out and let sit for at Least 10minutes-it sets better and won't burn your mouth! I served it warm with ice cream and and a little whipped topping! Perfect!! The only change I would make next time is to spray the pan 1st. It wasn't greasy or mushy. The person who said it didnt rise probably didnt use self rising flour or didnt add baking powder? Thanks too all, I've been on this site for 1 yr now - Love it!! :)",
