Considering I find this \"review\" section as a most helpful and valuible tool to \"tweak\" the recipes I find on this site I hate to be repetitive.  But, I also chose to use to \"ready made\" store bought phyllo cups.  Saves much time and $$ if you do not already have tartlet pans.  I have found this recipe is best served hot but is also quite good served at room temp.  Have not yet found any reason to variate from the original recipe as well as if you choose to use the store bought phyllo cups, once prepared, the individual plastic moldings they come in make for perfect transporation to serve an elegant app that appears time consumming.",

I used real crab meat out of the shell, not even the canned stuff, and that was a dumb mistake. You don't even need to use canned crab - use imitation crab and chop it up small. You cannot taste the crab over the cream cheese and cheddar cheese, so it's mainly there for texture. I could have saved myself some dollars if I had used imitation, and you wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. I will definitely be making these again (they were a hit at the party) but with cheaper ingrediants!",

I'm glad I tested this out first before bringing it to the party I was going to. After the first small batch I added spices, lemon juice, and fresh minced garlic to the filling but it still wasn't anything spectacular. I even ran out and bought more crab. After doubling the crab and green onions and adding cajun seasoning, fresh ground pepper, lemon juice, and garlic the filling was alright but still nothing great. The refrigerated biscuit dough was too doughy so I tried using phyllo cups which were definitely better but still nothing really good. Even hubby thought it was edible but didn't really want to eat it and he loves crab. I was supposed to bring an appy to a party and planned on bringing this but ended up scrapping it altogether and made something else.",
