I used low-sodium bacon, however, I think any bacon would work well. Served with a side salad of mixed greens and fresh berries, this makes a great brunch or light supper sandwich.",

I used feta cheese and mozzarella cheese instead of the blue cheese. I then broiled them for just a minute or two. Then and drizzled more poppy seed dressing on top. I made this for a party and could not keep enough of them going. Every one loved them. It took a while for people to figure out the flavors. The pears are very subtle.

I cooked my bacon and sliced my pear as it cooked. I removed the bacon and sauteed the pear slices in the drippings. I assembled my sandwiches on homemade French Bread but it seemed as if it might need more moisture so I spread each toasted slice with about a tsp of bleu cheese dressing then added the pear slices then the bacon and finally the crumbled bleu cheese. The only complaint brought to my attention was I should have made twice as much. Thanks Harleaghsgirl this is a keeped!",
