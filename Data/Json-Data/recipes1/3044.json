By the way....this is a great recipe for when you start out making a pecan pie, and discover (in the middle of mixing ingredients) that you do not have any pecans.  This is such an easy pie...if you've never tried to bake a pie....try this one!",

I ate the pie first it looked just like pecan pie and I love pecan pie. My husband loved it too and asked me to get the recipe. I was shocked to learn it was an oatmeal pie. It's heavenly. I made it for an early Thanksgiving family feast and it was gone even before the pumpkin pies were! Thanks for sharing!!!",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent pie very similar to Pecan Pie but with a slightly different taste and texture. Good in its own right. However a few comments: 1. I agree that the timing in the original recipe is off. Like that of another poster my oven is accurately calibrated (checked it today with an infrared thermometer). I found that after 45 minutes at 325 degrees the pie was not nearly done as the center was almost liquid. It was much better after 60 minutes although still a bit soft. I suggest you cook the pie for 60 minutes AR 325 or perhaps 45 minutes at 350 (which is what most pecan pie recipes specify). 2. Regular rolled oats work fine; no need to use quick-cooking oats. 3. A teaspoon of vanilla might be a good addition.",

This way your eggs won't come into direct contact with the melted butter. I added 1/4 t salt, used a hand mixer just because, and covered the crust with a pie shield after 30-35 minutes. This is easy to transport, too. Thanks for posting!",
