I don't care for celery and my boyfriend doesn't like onions so I just saut\u00e9 green and red peppers and chopped up jalape\u00f1o peppers (for a little kick) in the ketchup sauce. I also use the whole sauce to mix in with the meat rather than just half of it along with meat loaf seasoning. All this makes for a very flavorful and moist loaf that you don't really need to put anything on it. Another trick of mine is to use the royal Hawaiian sweet rolls for the bread crumbs. The sweetness of the rolls really compliments the spicy and saltiness. Also tried this recipe with ground turkey tastes awesome.",

(Dang it was good!) I loved that half the vegetable/sauce mixture went in the meatloaf the other half reserved to serve with the meatloaf. The fact that the recipe included all three vegetables I believe are a must in meatloaf appealed to me however after noticing there was no seasoning in the recipe I felt compelled to add one of my favorite seasoning blends. I scaled this down to two servings for a meal for the two of us with no leftovers. Using just 1/2 pound of ground beef made it impractical to prepare this as a meatloaf so I made little muffin meatloaves with it which made five. If you add some seasoning this is a darned fine meatloaf.",
