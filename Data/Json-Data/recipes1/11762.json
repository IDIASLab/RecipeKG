The crust stayed really crisp. I also added one finely chopped peeled granny smith apple and a cup of sliced strawberries to it and one tablespoon of flour to thicken the filling. I put about 2/3rds of the crumb mix on the top and over the edges of the cooked ready made crust so the edges wouldn't burn. I cooked it for about an hour until the filling bubbled over. It is definitly a keeper as my husband is very fussy about pies and he loved it.",
