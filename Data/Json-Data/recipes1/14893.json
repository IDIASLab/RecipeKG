I used mango and pineapple instead of papaya had cashews instead of peanuts and didn't have fish sauce so I upped the soy sauce slightly. With the changes still a winner. I served over Jasmine rice-yum! My husband is always skeptical when I make these healthy unique ethnic dishes and offers some constructive criticism. But this one left him speechless--he LOVED it. I will be making this again soon. Thanks for sharing!!",
