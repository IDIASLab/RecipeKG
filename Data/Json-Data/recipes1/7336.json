Here's the options:  fresh tomatoes rather than stewed, they stew fine during the two hour+ cooking time.  This last time, I used three large juicy red tomatoes, chopped (for those of you gardener-cooks, you will be pleased to note that yellow pear, sweet grape, and heirloom orange all work wonderfully; tomato paste 3-6 TBLS, 1-2 tsp. italian seasoning, + S&P work well instead of a spaghetti packet; 1/4 cup dried minced onion, and add 1/2 cup water or cola instead of fresh onions if there are none available in your pantry.  However if you use fresh onion, chop them nice and small so they cook thoroughly...it's not very nice to chomp into rubbery onion; and I have found it best to use a non-stick dutch oven with a very low simmer(careful those of you with propane),unless you like a black-eyed pot roast! Your other option is of course the crock pot! 8-9 hours on low, 5-6 hours on high, no blackening required. For my LOW CARB cook mates: Count your spaghetti packet as carbs, or use the above tomato paste option; exchange the one cup regular cola with a splenda sweetened cola like Diet Rite, which keep the cola and sweet taste during the simmering.  Neither Aspartame, nutrasweet,or equal will simmer. Enjoy",

I blended it up with some hot sauce and it was delicious. I poured the sauce on the bottom of a baking dish and then rolled the meat mixture into tortillas covering it with the sauce and some extra cheese. I baked it for about 30 minutes at 350. Yum!",

This was so moist and had a great flavor.  It does make a lot of gravy, so I'm thinking you could even use a 4 or 5 lb roast with this.

Most of the people I served it to including the kids liked the roast because it was not too spicy and the flavor of the meat was not overpowered by any one ingredient.",
