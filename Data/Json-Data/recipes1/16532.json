I found whisking rather than stirring worked better, and it appeared to have arrived at the consistency I wanted at 40 minutes.  It did firm up substantially when cooled, however, I wanted to use it as a drizzle on some brownies, so allow for that in your timing.  It does taste awesome, but the texture of it is not what I\u2019m used to with dulce de leche, and maybe this  shouldn\u2019t be.  Just not as creamy and a bit on the grainy side.  Honestly, I think I\u2019ll just stick with canned dulce de leche, but thanks for sharing your recipe.",

The biggest difference is I used no sugar, only Truvia Sweet Complete. I'm thrilled to know I was able to get the same results with a sugar-free alternative. Love it in my morning coffee and on the apple of the day! Finally I can feed my caramel craving guilt-free!",
