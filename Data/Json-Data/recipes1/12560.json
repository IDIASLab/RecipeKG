Added a little cinnamon decoration no problems yet. About eight minutes later after I had done some flipping and rearranging they began to burn. My stove has \"lo 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 hi\" settings and I had it on 7. By the time I had made the last piece I had switched it down to 3. Watch these do not leave them alone they get very messed up! It probably depends on the stove but we needed low medium heat. These were funny- not sure I'll make them again. Big French toast fan-but not really of these.",
