                "reviewBody": "I'll echo what others have said in saying that this cake is amazing. And despite being pretty easy to make it looks like it was prepared at a bakery. Just a few tips: 1. I definitely think the cake needs longer to cook than the 15 minutes they suggest. I would say closer to 30. Use the toothpick test and wait until it's a light golden brown on the outside. 2. The part that's easiest to mess up is the filling. Make sure the whipped cream is as \"firm\" as possible before adding it to the pudding mixture. (It's best to keep the beaters and bowl in the freezer until ready to use). And make sure that the cake is totally cooled before you add the filling or you'll probably be dealing with a mess. 3. I'd go with more chocolate than the 1.5 oz bar they suggest. It wasn't nearly enough to drizzle over the cake. 4. It may feel like a lot of amaretto when you're making it but the taste is definitely not overpowering when it's done. I'd recommend using the full amount. Enjoy - it's fabulous!",

                "reviewBody": "I kind of freaked out at first because at 15 minutes at 325 degrees the layers were all still very liquidy and a clean toothpick inserted into the center was not coming out clean. However I continued baking and checking them at 5 minute intervals they looked much better after an additional 15 minutes and everything else went smoothly. So i just reccomend upping the baking time to 30 minutes. Also I beleive that you are supposed to use the liquid creamer thats what I used because an entire cup of powdered creamer just seemed like too much to me. Maybe I'm wrong but it all worked out in the end!:-) Happy Baking!",

Cooked according to directions. Could not get them out of the pans because they were so moist. Made it again in a 9 X 13 pan and used shortening and flour. Turned out great but it still stuck to the pan a little. Next time I make it I'll put wax paper in the bottom of the pans and see if that helps. The cake is absolutely \"divine\" and I will be making this a lot. Co-workers loved it and it has now become my husbands favorite cake!",

I took it to work for a coworker of mine and it was gone before the end of the day. Everyone that tasted it raved about how good it was and I handed the recipe out to at least two people. One thing though about the recipe: when you mix the pudding mix with the creamer and amaretto it doesn't thicken as pudding would with milk but that's okay(at first I thought I goofed). Also if you're not good at whipping cream ( and I'm not) Cool Whip works just as well but I'd try the extra creamy versions. All in all this cake recipe ROCKS!",

When I went to make the filling I realized I had no vanilla pudding so I used chocolate. As the birthday \"girl\" and her husband do not drink I did not use Amaretto in the filling. I also am not a big fan of heavy cream so i substituted fat free Cool Whip. The modifications were awesome! I used the filling solely as filling between the layers. I then frosted the cake w/Duncan Hines vanilla frosting (no choc drizzle). Awesome cake w/minimal effort above and beyond baking a plain box cake. Thanks! Ooops forgot I baked at least 30 minutes (toothpick test). UPDATE: VERY important to line pans w/parchment if you'd like them to come out in tact.....if you forget (as I did on my second try) this will create a wonderful tasting trifle!",
