I put about 1/2 c chocolate chips into a sandwich baggie and melted in a bowl over the warm oven (though I'm sure it would have been just as easy in the microwave). Then I cut the corner of the baggie in order to make it simple to drizzle the chocolate over the bars. PERFECT!! These are tasty warm -- but EXCELLENT the next day when they've cooled completely (we made them at night and the next morning they were perfect!)",

My modifications - I increased the graham crackers to 2 cups and the butter to 3/4 cup to make a thicker crust and decreased the chocolate chips to 1 cup (I think it'd be way too sweet with 2 cups of chips). I also used chocolate graham crackers instead of the regular kind. Since the crust was thicker I ended up cooking about 30-35 minutes. It turned out pretty well and it was an interesting variation on the traditional Magic Layer bars. Very sweet and chewy!",

I used pecan (personal preference) and 1 cup chocolate chips with 1 cup peanut butter chips. For the topping I melted the chocolate in the microwave 45 seconds on high then stirred well then in 30 second intervals with stirring in between until just melted. It is easy to scorch chocolate in the microwave so it needs to be stirred often. Then I used a teaspoon to splatter it on the top. It was a little to thick to drizzle. I will definitely make this one again. Oh yeah be forewarned it is very sweet!!",
