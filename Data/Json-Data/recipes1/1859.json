I used it for 2 9 inch layers and had quite a lot of frosting left over but what I did was 2 cups of milk 2 envelopes of whipped topping mix 1 package of instant vanilla pudding mix 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 cup of confectioner's sugar (maybe more like 1/2-3/4 cup.. I just kept dumping more and more in until I was satisfied). Even with this plus whipping with a electric hand mixer for a long time it was very pudding like. I was still able to use it to frost the cake but not pipe it or make any shapes out of the frosting. I suggest cutting the milk in half or at least making it 1.5 cups vs. 2 cups and lessening the amount of pudding mix put in so you wouldn't need as much sugar to thicken. Leftover frosting isn't bad though once I finished my brother came and looked and immediately took a strawberry I hadn't used and dipped it in the extra frosting and ate it.. and then did it again. So it tastes great as dip for strawberries! Mine came out a tad sweet for the cake as I did do the gelatin thing as well.",
