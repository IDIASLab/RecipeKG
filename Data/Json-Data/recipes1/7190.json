Plus it's just as the submitter describes - good simple and inexpensive which is just what a pot roast should be as it's classic comfort food. I chose to cook mine in a slow cooker vs. the oven. And I also subbed a can of beef broth for the water as it brings out more of the beef flavor plus it makes for some really good gravy. I left out the potatoes celery and carrots and instead put the roast on a bed of portabella mushrooms. I cooked it low and slow for 8 hours and it was falling apart and above all delicious - perfect with mashed potatoes!",

I always made my roasts in a crock pot and they cooked so long that the meat was dry and had a weird texture. This is a new favorite! Thanks.",

Instead of water I subsistuted beef broth threw in one whole yello onion cut up and then seasoned the top of the roast with some ground garlic pepper. I also put about five pieces of bay leaves for some extra aroma. As for time I lowered the temperature and cooked it in a regular pan for almost three hours as well. All in all it came out pretty good for the little work put into such a large meal.",
