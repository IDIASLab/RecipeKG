The butter adds flavor while the crisco adds flakiness.  Also, a couple of hints: After you have molded the pie crust to the pan, rest it in the refrigerator for 40 minutes.  This relaxes the gluten and reduces shrinkage.  After 40 minutes, put it directly into the freezer for 20 minutes (this step increase flakiness).  Add the filling quickly and bake immediately.  Of course,this added step is if you're truly in pursuit of perfection, but isn't essential.  Lastly, I am not very talented at rolling out the dough and peeling it off the counter.  Plus, adding flour to the counter alters the recipe.  I discovered that if I roll it out between 2 pieces of large saran wrap, I can unpeel one piece, flip it onto the pie plate and then unpeel the second piece of saran wrap without ever even having to touch it with my hands.  This was a great discovery!  Thanks for this truly exceptional recipe.  Try this crust with the Apple Crumble Pie recipe on this site!",

I followed the recipe exactly using cake flour which I have to admit I've never used in pie crust before - I doubled the recipe for a deep dish pie \"Vermont Apple Pie\" from this site to be exact. I used butter flavored shortening and found that I only need 8 Tbsp. of the egg yolk, water/vinegar mixture. I chilled the dough in the freezer for a bit and then I rolled the dough out onto wax paper that was lightly floured and it was a breeze to put into a deep dish pie plate. It baked up beautifully! I'm so glad I found this recipe!!!",

The key is to keep things cold and to handle the crust as little as possible so the gluten doesn't break down (which makes it tough and not flaky). I always just used a fork instead of a food processor and regular AP flour and it turns out wonderful. I've also used frozen butter cut with a cheese grater (easier then a fork) and it worked out great.",

Although I am a pretty good baker, I don't consider pies one of my specialties.  The other problem was I had to work through Wednesday and didn't know how I would have time to make 6 pies Wednesday night after working all day!  I made six crusts with this recipe the weekend before Thanksgiving and froze them.  Wednesday night I pulled them out and added the various fillings and baked.  They came out perfectly!!! Also -- I followed Mindy W's advice about rolling the crust out between saran wrap.  WOW!! EASY AND NO MESS!!! Thank-you!",

Although this recipe requires a few additional steps I think it is well worth the extra effort. As Carole recommends the key is to sprinkle the liquid mixture a little at a time. (I used about 4 Tbsp.) At first mine felt a little too moist but I sprinkled a little flour on the dough prior to rolling it out and it came out just right. I recommend rolling it out between wax paper so that once the crust has been placed in the pan you can peel off the wax paper without tearing the dough. The only additional step I took was to refrigerate the crust for about 15-20 minutes after I placed it in the pan. I've been told you need to let the gluten relax after you've rolled it out to avoid too much shrinkage when pre-baking the crust. All I can say is my pie crust came out pretty close to perfect. My husband gave the crust a thumbs up. Thanks Carole!",

I found I needed only about 1/4 c. of the ice water which I mixed with the egg yolk and vinegar without the extra water and ice cubes. I chilled the dough only slightly then rolled it out between two sheets of waxed paper to keep it from sticking.",

I don't know if it was operator error but my dough was very moist (apparently I am still not sure if that was the problem) and when I tried to roll it stuck to everything and by the time I got it on top of my potpie it was in several pieces (appearance was gross). I had to cook it 10 extra minutes on my pie and it still tasted undercooked although it was brown. It was very tender.. too tender... it turned into complete mush! Yuck. I almost couldn't eat... almost.",
