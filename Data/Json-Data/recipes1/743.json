Mix up the first 4 ingredients, then dissolve the coffee in 1 tsp of water, and add it in as a paste - mix it in well.  Add a few drops more water if necessary. Then chill, roll out & cut, chill again, then bake at 325F. For me, no extra sugar is necessary as I like the coffee flavour to come through and I dont' like very sweet cookies!  I've also made the same recipe using lemon zest and lemon juice instead of the coffee, or orange zest/juice with a tsp of cinamon.",

I melted the butter before adding it and since the dough was a little greasy I added about 1/4 cup extra almond meal. Next time I might cut back on the butter (1/2 cup would probably be plenty). I could hardly stop myself from eating all the dough raw! I thought it was plenty sweet as it was so I didn't sprinkle on any extra sugar at the end. I skipped the part about chilling the dough and rolling it out; instead I just formed it into cookie-sized balls flattened them a little and placed them directly on a baking tray. The finished cookies were delicious too but nothing could quite compare with that dough! Update: I made it a second time and did everything the same except decreasing the butter to 1/2 cup. Well that ended up not being enough and at the last minute I added some coconut oil to make the dough less dry and crumbly. That worked well too (and tasted great!) but I'll probably just stick with the amount of butter the recipe calls for from now on. Anyway I brought the cookies to a brunch today and they were a big hit!",
