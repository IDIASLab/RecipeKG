When marinading the chicken I used lots more of all the spices and used garlic puree instead of powder to form a brush-on paste. To add flavour to the potatoes onions and carrots I sprinkled thyme and black pepper on them. I also found that after an hour in the oven the chicken was still pink in the middle and all the vegetables looked really dried up so I poured a can of chopped tomatoes and a dash of white wine over it and cooked it for another half an hour. After that it tasted really good and my family were really impressed with it.",

I cooked at 400 for an hour and most of the veggies were done. A few of the carrots were not so unless you cut them really thinly I would suggest cooking them a bit first. Last thing.. if I had used the amount of veggie listed in the recipe they wouldn't have all fit in the pan... as it was with one sweet potato one white potato one onion and a few more carrots.. it was very full.",
