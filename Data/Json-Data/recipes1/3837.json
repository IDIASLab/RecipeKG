I have been making it a bit differently now too.\nI usually use bow tie or whole wheat penne pasta.  I boil it, and when it's about half/1/4 done I add the broccoli.  In a seperate sauce pan (while the water and pasta boil) I sautee about 1-2 tsp jarred garlic in butter until it starts to smell sweet.  I then add mushrooms(about 8 oz)and sautee them with a about 1 TBS of white wine.  I then add the cream (lately though I've been using fat free half and half and if needed thicken it with a bit of corn starch) and some basil.  I then add the tomato sauce (one small can) and freshly ground pepper and salt.  I let the sauce simmer covered until the pasta and broccoli are done, then add the sauce to the drained pasta and broccoli.  It is a bit more work, but I like having the sautee'd mushrooms and letting the flavors meld together in the sauce.  I serve it topped with parm cheese.",

I used more tomato sauce and more parmesan to thicken the sauce like the chef did.  (Add parmesan gradually to prevent clumping).  He also used tubular pasta.  I would like to find a way to make this lower in fat.\n\nUpdate:\nAfter making this several times, here are the changes I recommend:\n1) double the recipe\n2) add an entire small can of tomato sauce\n3) add sliced red peppers - gives it a \"restaurant style\" appearance.\n4) use penne pasta (tubes)\n5) to make lower in fat, use half-and-half w/ a little cornstarch.",

Before adding the garlic and mushrooms to the sauce I sauteed them in butter. I know this adds calories but it also adds flavor. Don't forget to add the salt pepper and parmesian. It makes a BIG difference in the flavor. My only complaint is that the sauce was too thin. I mixed 1 TBSP. water 1 TBSP cornstarch and added it to the sauce. This made a good consistency.",

Saute garlic and a pound of sliced baby bellas in the butter and add to steamed veggies. Mix in 17 ounces italian sauce (I use Trader Joes Italian Starter and it is awesome!) 1 cup heavy cream and 3-6 ounces of tomato paste with the veggies. Dice and brown 3 -4 pieces of bacon set aside. Once the pasta is done (always reserve a teaspoon or so of the water and add to your sauces as a thickener)put it back into the pot that you cooked it in and add the veggies/tomato sauce mixture. Cover and allow to simmer for 5 - 10 minutes until the veggies are soft (not mushy) and the pasta is done. Top with shredded mozzarella (a cup or so) and bacon. Cover and remove from heat just so cheese melts. Serve immediately. You can add shrimp diced chicken turkey sausage spinach whatever to this and it is very good. Sausage and peas would be a really good substitute for the broccoli and mushrooms!",
