It's rather dense and tends to go well with coffee or tea. The cinnamon and chocolate did actually come together well in the end. The recipe is however flawed as there is no indication of where the flour mixture is to be added (I added it along with the cold water/vanilla). Of course no cake is complete without icing-- so I used a maple-syrup-meringue one for sandwiching and covering. Very good indeed.",
