Check your baking soda and Cream of Tartar to make sure they're fresh.  Baking soda goes flat pretty soon after opening the box.  I start a new box almost every month.  To test it, just put a tiny bit of the soda in some water.  If it doesn't start fizzing immediately, it's not any good.  Also, if your eggs are too big the dough will spread too much.  Most recipes call for large eggs, not extra large.  When I make this recipe, I usually pour off just a tiny bit of the egg white, because I like my cookies puffy.  Hope this helps, because I've tried a lot of snickerdoodle recipes, and this is by far the best.",

Either way, the critics (my family & friends) RAVED about these yummies, and I've never left w/o someone asking for the recipe!  1st: Use butter AND eggs that are room temp. I've used all butter w/excellent results. 2nd: Mix dry & wet separately. 3rd: Hand mix or you'll get a different result.  Do not overmix.  I never have cream of tartar, so I use 2 tsp. of white vinegar OR lemon juice.  Lastly, I used a medium scoop. For the topping, I used 3T. sugar & 3.5 tsp. of cinnamon dumped in ziplock bag.  Do not be afraid to over coat.  It will NOT turn out too sweet (and I'm not a fan of sweets)!!!! Coat well. :) If your cookie turns out flat, I'd check to see if your baking soda has expired.  To test, it should fizzle the second you place it in water.  I've never had issues w/these turning out flat OR dough being sticky (which was really confusing to me to hear from others); just keeping them in our lock n lock container long enough before husband comes home.  They store great, & I didn't have any of the problems many others did!  I never need to put these in the refrigerator first either!",

I also take the cookies off the baking sheet asap so they don't have time to heat up and lose their puffiness. Just the way I like them--big, chewy and puffy!",

I've made it at least a dozen times, and I've learned a few things along the way:  1) For cookies that are crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, bake for only 8 mins. and remove from sheet immmediately to cool on wire rack. You may even want to lower oven temp. slightly. 2) I agree with a previous reviewer that cinnamon/sugar mixture should be increased to 3T white sugar, and 3tsp. cinnamon. 3) For a REALLY quick and mess-free method of rolling balls of dough in cinnamon/sugar mixture, place mixture in a sandwich baggie and drop one ball in at a time to coat. (Thoroughly-coated makes for a tastier snix). Enjoy! And thank you, Beth, for another wonderful recipe! ...Got any ideas for a good sugar/cut-out cookie? ;-)",

Made a double batch last night in my Bosch, and saved some dough in the fridge to make some more over the next few days.  I forgot to buy cream of tartar after I made them last time, so got to that step & was trying to figure out what to do...when allrecipes.com came to the rescue: I went to allrecipes.com/advice/ref/subs/ and found out that you can substitute 1 t. of cream of tartar with 2 t. of lemon juice or vinegar.  I opted for the lemon juice, and WOW, you'd never know the difference between the recipe with the cream of tartar and the one with the lemon juice!  Just a hint for anyone else in the same predicament :)  Thanks for this awesome recipe, it will be a favorite forever.  Also, to keep your cookies soft, you can add the heal of a loaf of bread to your container of cookies/cookie jar.  Or else lightly spray with water the tops & microwave for 10 secs. or so (time depends on your microwave) to give it that fresh-from-the-oven taste.  Just a tip :)",

I used a small ice cream type scoop (size 100, the size is on the scrapper bar inside the well of the scoop) and got about 68 cookies.  I baked them at 375 for 8 minutes.  Use parchment paper on your cookie sheets and just slide the parchemnt and all off the sheets to the cooling rack.\r\n\r\nAnother hint is to scoop out all the balls first then roll them in the sugar/cinnamon.  One way to keep them from making a mess of your hands is to wet your hande first.  The dough will not stick to your palms as you roll them.  \r\n\r\nThese do flatten out but are definately a great cookie.",
