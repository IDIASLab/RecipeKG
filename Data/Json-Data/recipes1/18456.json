No maple syrup in house so I used wildflower honey with a very aromatic scent and flavour.  It mixed very well with the thyme.  UPDATE:  Finally got to try this exactly as written.  Just delicious.  The maple syrup in this comes out with almost a smokey flavour.  The fresh thyme also adds a herbal flavour that mixes well with the maple syrup and the sweetness of the sweet potatoes.  Thanks a million.  Don.",

I peeled my sweet potato but just scrubbed the carrots and parsnips (used two small of each so about equal to the sweet potato).
