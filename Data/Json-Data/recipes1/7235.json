I prepared the chicken to marinade over night. Then using precooked bacon and sausage threw all the ingredients except the rice chicken and shrimp in the slowcooker on low for about 10 hours. When I got home from work I added the shrimp and turned the heat up to high for about 45 minutes. While that was finishing I cooked the rice on the stovetop and added for the last half hour and baked the chicken in the oven and tossed with the finished product. My whole family loved it even my picky 3 year old ate some.",

I skipped adding the flour and just added the seasonings tomatoes chicken stock chicken chunks and kielbasa. I also added seasoning salt to taste. I let it cook for 1.5 hours then added 3 cups of rice(I like my jambalaya on the wet side. After 30 minutes I cut the heat and added a pound of shrimp. When they turned pink it was ready.

I used only 3 meats: bacon hot bulk pork sausage and the chicken with marinade. I used both white & brown rice (because when sized for 5 the recipe doesn't call for as much rice as I like). I left pretty much everything else the same except I had to add about twice as much chicken broth to it as it said to but I suspect that's because of resizing the recipe from 50 servings down to 5. All in all really good really tender veggies but really time consuming even with only 3 meats to prepare. Served it with buttered French bread Cherry Limeade I from this site and Bananas Foster II from this site for dessert:-)",
