I always mix a jar of caramel ice cream topping to the sweetened condensed milk and warm it in the microwave so it's easier to pour into and over all those holes.  This cake is even better the next day (if it lasts that long).  Since we're such big fans of Heath Bars, I use no less than 6 on this cake.  This is one of my all time favorite recipes.  It's easy and delicious!",

Also instead of pouring on the condensed milk & caramel sauce separately I heated them up in a sauce pan over low heat & poured it over the cake so it ran into the slits. Sprinkled the Skor (Heath) chunks over the cake & then topped with low fat Cool Whip. I will definitely make this one again!",
