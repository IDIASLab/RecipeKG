A couple of things to note that did not work for me. Everything was coming along just fine until the roasted veggies and parm went in. The zucchini got overcooked and the parm clumped like no other. When I make this again I will skip the step of reheating and will also save the parm for the top of the dish. Flavor wise, this is one of the best zucchini dishes I've had.",
