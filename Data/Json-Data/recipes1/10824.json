I did sub the onions out for Scallions for a nice spring color. They tasted great. Next time I plan to add some water chestnuts diced up to give it a little bit of crunch- every liked them and thought they were a nice addition to the Easter table where there was already deviled eggs.",

They were GONE. The overall texture was good nice crunch from the onion and bread crumbs I used Panko seasoned bread crumbs...we didn't feel that they needed anything more. But our favorite way was with the cream cheese with the chives!!! Man it was good I could not keep my fingers out of the mix!! TY a keeper!",
