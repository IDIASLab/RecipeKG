When we have it with a meat dish I leave out the sugar and top it with gravy from whatever type of meat I made. When we have it for breakfast since it has two eggs in it I make two of them and we both have one along with 4 sausage links or 4 strips of crisp cooked thick sliced bacon from the butcher counter. I'll top it with maple syrup hot cherry pie filling or our favorite hot apple pie filling. It's a very filling and comforting breakfast that we usually have on a weekend morning so we can enjoy that wonderful satiated feeling and just lounge around for a couple of hours. As stated it looks fancy but super easy to make.",

I have tried many different types of pans, but the best, by far, has always been the ol' trusty 9 in cast iron. My mother used this for dual purpose growing up. 1: We all enjoyed the  out of it. 2: she said we had to be quiet or the pancake would fall. However, if I may give you 1 tip, beat the eggs lightly in a seperate bowl, then mix in with the rest of the batter. It will keep you from over beating the eggs. If you do over beat them the pancake loses a lot of \"fluff\" and doesn't rise very well.",
