Yes, you may add more things, like wine, or aromatics, but the more additions, the more complications and subbing, and then the tweaking begins!  I chose not to view the video beforehand, just to check out the instructions and the cooking times.  I went on the low side of the recommended times, and the chicken came out perfectly, with rich, delicious mushrooms.  We really enjoyed our Sunday chicken today!",

I\u2019m a seasoned cook and I always want to add something like wine or whatever to pan jus. I watched Chef John\u2019s video of this recipe and I think that I saw him sneak in some cayenne pepper in the video. Chef John always has cayenne pepper in his recipes and I\u2019d bet that he adds it to his oatmeal in the morning. :) I served this with Sarah\u2019s Rice Pilaf recipe that is posted on this site and with green beans as the 2nd side dish.
