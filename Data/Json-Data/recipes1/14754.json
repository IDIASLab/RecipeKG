My in-laws were so impressed they wanted to have a plank to take home!  Costco has them for $8 for a package of 6.  The package on the plank states that if it's not too charred you can use is again after cleaning with warm water and letting it air dry.  Also, to save time, planks can be presoaked and frozen.  I can't encourage you enough to try this incredible recipe!\nThank you for the post.",

Wow. First, I started with the Wal-Mart frozen salmon my husband buys (which I usually dislike, but this recipe made it taste awesome!) Second, my 4 yr old son and my 13 yr old daughter usually won't touch fish -- but they both gobbled this up! For that reason alone, this gets 5 stars. But it was so smoky and layered with different flavors, thanks to the marinade. I have 6 kids and all but one raved (the other one, at 17, only eats pasta and butter so she doesn't count.) My husband loved it, too. I'm from Michigan but live in Louisiana, yet when I was done cooking this, I felt like I was in a ski lodge up north somewhere, that's how it smelled! Wonderful, thanks for the recipe!",
