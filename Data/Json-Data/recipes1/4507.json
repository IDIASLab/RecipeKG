Also I find if you bring to a boil and boil a full 3 minutes; the brown sugar butter mixture will set up perfectly. These are just as great as the soda cracker cookies in this sight. It's hard to tell the difference. But if you compare taste; the saltines bring out the toffee flavors a bit more because of the salt. I made these at Christmas time. I also made these with milk chocolate chips instead of nuts and used 1 cup of toffee bits sold along with chocolate chip section of the baking aisle. My grandson isn't a nut lover and thought these were great this way. My coffee group thought these were a great Valentine Day treat.",

I always line my pan with foil spray it and let the butter/sugar simmer for a couple minutes so it thickens. I spread the chocolate chips with a spatula and stick them in the frig for a little while to speed up the cooling process. They always come out perfect. I don't even try to break them into nice/neat squares. I treat them like \"toffee\" and just break them into pieces with jagged ends/corners.
