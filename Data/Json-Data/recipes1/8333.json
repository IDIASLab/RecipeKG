Ok so I sampled the dough and thought \"this is pretty good stuff\". then I tried one fresh out of the oven it was warm and gooey and I thought \"yum this is a really tasty cookie.\" Well now they've cooled a bit and the chocolate chips have set and wow the texture has improved what was already a tasty cookie. Silky firm rich chocolate chewy tart cranberries dough crispy on the outside soft inside. The oatmeal and whole grain flour make me feel better about all the butter and sugar. And they are hearty but they're not hockey pucks either they're still light. I am glad that took heed of the review that said these cookies don't spread and flattened them before baking. Thy this its a good one.",
