I used this recipe as a base and since i didn't have maple sugar on hand I added a few other ingredients based on my friends suggestions. I peeled the skin of the potatoes, then I cut the fries in 1/2\" thick french fry slices. I seasoned the fries in a dry rub of cayenne pepper, salt, paprika, cinnamon, brown sugar, and olive oil. I baked them on a lighly oiled baking sheet and sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on them during the last 5 minutes. These were very tasty and good. I will definitely be making them again. I can only imagine how the maple syrup would have tasted. I'm sure it would have really added a nice nutty caramel flavor to these wondrous treats.  ",

Instead of brushing the mixture on the chips, I shook the chips, oil & seasonings in a large baggie.  For those who complained the chips were soggy or burned:  First issue is that you have to slice these ridiculously thin - I used a chef's knife to do it.  You have to watch them like a hawk to avoid burning.  You have to turn them in the middle of cooking.  You need to remove the ones that are thinner & cooking faster as they get crisp/brown, and you need to run the final ones that aren't yet crips under the broiler.  I will make these again.  Oh - I would cook at least double to get enough chips to make it worth your while.",
