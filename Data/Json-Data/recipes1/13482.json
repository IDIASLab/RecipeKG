I also added 1 cup of walnuts. The first time I made the cake I cut back on the apples because it seemed like so much but didn't take into account that the apples would cook down so the second time I actually added more. Also the second time around I added another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. Although it was great the first time I thought it lacked the spice you get with apple pie. Came out great both ways but I will stick to how I made it the second time.",

Left the skins on for added color and fiber.  Only additions were 1/2 tsp. black walnut extract and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. clove.  I agree with other reviewers as to the ease of not sticking.  This was the easiest cake I ever got out of a bundt pan!  I only tasted the  remaining moist coating left inside the pan but it tasted wonderful.",

I gave it 4 stars because I made quite a few modifications. With my changes it is 5 star. I started out with adding one extra teaspoon of cinnamon a few dashes of nutmeg and a few dashes of cloves. I like a nice flavorful cake. The recipe calls for 2 tsp of vanilla and I used one tablespoon. I cut the sugar in half and it was still very sweet. If I had used the full amount it would have been inedible. As far as the apples go I waited until the batter was completely mixed before preparing the apples. Otherwise they get brown. I diced 4 and shredded three. The shredded apples just disappear into the cake and I wanted some texture so the diced bits worked out well. It also avoided that issue of the cake being too soggy. If you choose to shred all of them drain some but not all of the juice out. Some juice is needed to moisten the batter. The smell when baking filled the house with wonderful autumn like aromas. The cake came out wonderful. I dusted it with a little confectioner's sugar and served it with vanilla ice cream on the side. In my opinion it didn't need any icing or frosting. This cake would also be great with some walnuts and raisins added to the batter if you like them. Will definitely make it again with my modifications.",
