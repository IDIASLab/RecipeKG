You don't really cook anything, so it is good for kids to make, but it is better if it can chill for about three and a half hours so the marmalade and syrup can seep into the tortilla so you get a sweeter and gooier product.  This simple recipe is tantalizingly gooey and sweet, so it can be used as a snack, part of a meal, or a dessert!",
