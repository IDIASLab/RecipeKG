I used \"tomato basil and garlic\" pasta sauce instead of tomatoe sauce and Italian style tomatoe paste instead of plain. I don't normally like wine in dishes but it turned out very well (we used a sweet red table wine). My roommate and I were the ones who made this and since there were just two of us there was WAY WAY too much sauce with the meat... I'd reccommend cutting the all the tomatoe ingredients in half and you should still have enough for leftovers. Also we didn't cut the meat into 6 specific cuts we just cut the meat into as many oblong pieces as we could cut their thickness in half and then rolled them(you want to be sure they are not too thick!) Also I am notorious for using garlic in everything I cook... but I felt that it just really didn't blend well with the meat very much. I think garlic salt would have a much better effect. We served it with linguine noodles and it turned out great:) I will try this again with my suggestions sometime...",
