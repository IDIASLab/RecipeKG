Provided butter for those who wished to add a pat to their bowl. Used a can of chicken broth with enough water to cover potatoes and cooked them until they were tender (red potatoes in small cubes with peels still on). Did not measure milk but added until it looked right to me. Used talapia instead of cod. Sprinkled some Old Bay seasoning and a little cayenne into the pot and my secret ingredient for this type of dish which is a dash of cinnamon which brings out the sweetness of the corn and the milk (I don't measure but maybe 1/4 tsp). Lip smacking good!",

I separated out 1 cup of milk and mixed that with 1/4 cup of flour which I used to both slow the soup and thicken the broth right before serving. I also used 2 tsp. Old Bay Seasoning along with one packet of vegetable Bovril. Additionally Cod isn t necessary. I used a pound of Pollock and enough Halibut Shrimp and Scallops to make up another pound. Finally do not under any circumstances allow your fish to stew for 15 minutes. By all means stew the rest of it until it s reached a slow boil but once you add that fish no more than 5 minutes to finish it. Any more and you ll ruin that delicate meat. It was delicious and consumed with zeal.",
