We're out of green onions and my daughter isn't keen on biting into onion bits.:) Oh I also added a couple shakes of salt and pepper. A very good dip right away it will be excellent in a couple hours. Thanks for sharing Sara!",

I served a little extra on the side as well and it was great and there was a lot leftover which came in handy for dipping baby carrots while waiting for the salmon to cook:)",
