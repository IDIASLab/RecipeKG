Here's how: Make batter as recipe directs but divide it between two 9-inch round pans. Bake 30-35 minutes. It will make two layers each about 3/4-inch thick (doesn't rise much). Layer them with a quick lime icing- 1/2 stick butter the juice of one lime a dash of vanilla and enough confectioners sugar to make a nice thick icing. The cake is moist and mellow in flavor and the icing is sweet and tart- a perfect combo. My friends loved it and took slices home with them- and I'm a total novice at cakes!",

I will make the recipes again but I will increase the Flour 1 1/4 and the other ingredients as well cut the milk by 1/4 cup and add lemon zest instead of vanilla to bring up the mango more. Also I will add a mango glaze confection sugar butter and mango. I hope this review help new users of this recipe.",
