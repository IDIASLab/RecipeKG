The idea to take the chicken out after an hour and then continue simmering just the bones and skin is brilliant, yet so simple.  I can't believe I didn't think of it.  The chicken is so tender cooked this way!\r\nAnd the stock?  Well, I can tell you that I'm done searching for recipes.  This is THE one!

(and i'm cheap.) also, i recommend using a large yellow onion, and placing the peel in the stock while it's simmering. this give a rich yellow color. really tasty recipe! ",
