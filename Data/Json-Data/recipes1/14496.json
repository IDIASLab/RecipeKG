I left the skins on mine for the nutrients and set in a wooden spoon to cut (it took me a few cuts to get the hang of it).  I skipped the butter and just drizzled w/a little EVOO.  For the second part, I topped w/a mixture of bread crumbs (panko would be even better!), parm, garlic salt, crushed red pepper, and chives).  I'm not a huge potato fan (unless they are deep fried, of course), but I really like these.  These will be a potato staple at the LTH house!  TY!",

I find you don't have to do anything difficult to them to have them come out great - I just scrub the potatoes, cut the slices with two wooden spoon handles guarding the bottom of the potato and stick them in the oven when I've added the flavorings that go with my main dish. They are really amazing with a small basil leaf between each slice, or a sliver of garlic, or both. They brown very nicely without breadcrumbs or cheese, but they are also good with cheeses of all kinds, depending on what your guests or family prefer.  The original ones in the Swedish pub were completely plain, I believe, except for the butter and salt that made them brown so nicely - and nobody has ever complained about plain Hasselbacks that I've ever heard of.  It was brilliant of Pompier850 to post them in this accessible spot - helps make the world a better place.  By the way, our family also calls them armadillos, proving that great minds think alike. . .",
