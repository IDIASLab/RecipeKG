I actually made the meat balls (added parmesan, basil and garlic powder, less breadcrumb) a couple of days ago and froze them.  This morning I just mixed the spagetti sauce and a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes with juice (skipped the puree and added basil, oregano, and a couple of tablespoons of sugar to cut the acidity) and added the frozen meatballs.  Cooked for about 10 hours on low.  Tender, flavorful, and delicious.  Plenty of delicious sauce.  Thanks previous reviewers, and thanks for this great recipe submission!",

The meatball recipe I use is one pound of meatloaf mix (pork/veal/beef ground and packaged in the same package), 1/4 cups Italian  seasoned bread crumbs, 1/4 Parmesan cheese, season with garlic and onion powder (since my husband has textural issues with some foods!), pepper and salt.  Mix this with one egg as the recipe suggests.  I do, however, like the twist of cooking them in the crockpot and NOT precooking them!  Awesome!  The sauce was greasier than I typically like (understandably, since you don't drain the meat...) but they were a huge hit at the party I took them to.  They would be FIVE stars if the ratio wasn't so off for bread crumbs to meat...",

This helped them retain there shape and to allow the grease to drip off.  I added two additional garlic cloves but it was still bland.  I would recommend finding a speghetti sauce recipe from here instead of using a store bought jar of sauce.  I used Prego traditional sauce, maybe a more flavourful jarred sauce exists?  Good luck! I will probably look elsewhere for an more tasty recipe.",

I used 1 cup bread crumbs (Italian). 1 1/2 T. dried parsley & sauteed the onion before adding. I also used 3/4 c. egg beaters because the crumb mixture looked too dry. 26oz sauce 14oz crushed & 37oz puree! ( it was the only size the store had I was using that extra meat!) I added a little Italian seasoning because of that & a little sugar. Next time I might add a little red wine too! I cooked on high for the first hour then stirred. Finished with 4 more hours on low. They turned out great. I also used Laura's ground round as always. Not greasy AT ALL!!! We used these for meatball sub sandwiches- YUM! I'll use the leftovers with spaghetti. I love slow cooker recipes! THANKS.",

I used a jar of my favorite Classico sauce and added a little minced garlic and fresh basil along with a few splashes of red wine along with the rest of the ingredients. I cooked it for 6 hours on low and it smelled wonderful. When it was done I served it on toasted crusty Italian rolls with some mozzarella and topped with shredded Parmesan and Romano cheeses - YUM!",
