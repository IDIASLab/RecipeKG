My husband stood up in the middle of the party and appologized to the guests for the cake that was ordered because as he said \" my wife makes it way better\" but in spanish.\n\nAnd as for the feedback that if you don't have or us a stand mixer you aren't a real baker BS. I have baked for years and this cake has been don 3 times a year for about two years now and alway turned out great with a hand mixer. This will be the first year i use my stand mixer. Remember not everyone can afford a $400 piece of equipment. That does not make them any less of a baker. Just s less fortunate one.",

                "reviewBody": "For all the bad ratings out there on this recipe I wonder if the people were cooking instead of baking. There is a difference and those that know it know what I'm talking about. When the recipe calls for the butter to be at room temperature that's what it needs to be at or otherwise bad things can happen. Creaming the butter and sugar is an important step one that can't be done by a half minute of the hand beater rather it should be done in a stand mixer until it is light and fluffy like the recipe calls for. The only substitution I made was to use cake flour instead of all purpose due to the fact that cake flour has less protein and gluten making it able to be lighter and fluffier than all-purpose which is better for crusty breads and other yeast risen baked goods. That being said this was an incredible cake that had all my guests raving. Follow the recipe exactly as it says use the proper baking utensils (If you do a lot of baking you already have a Kitchen Aid stand mixer. If you don't you don't bake much.) and enjoy!",

You might as well put a store bought yellow cake mix in a bowl of milk.  In addition, the timings are not even close to being correct. The cake won't even have set by the time it gets to 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nOn the good site, this recipe is what finally got me to register for this site. I really wish I had read some of these reviews before wasted my money on this. \r\n\r\nNOTE: If you have tried this recipe, you STILL don't know whether you like Tres Leches because you still have never TRIED Tres Leches.
