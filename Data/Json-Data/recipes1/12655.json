I'm glad I did!  \n\nHere was my version since I had nothing fresh on hand.  Since I was feeding 6 people I used 3 cups frozen lima beans, 2 cans diced tomatos (with juice), 2 cups of frozen sweet corn, 1 stick of butter, seasoning salt, pepper and a touch of onion powder to taste.  I simmered the limas first with the stick of butter until tender (15-20 min), added tomatos, corn, 2 packs of Splenda and seasonings.  Simmered on low for another 15 minutes and Voila!  Every last bite was thoroughly enjoyed by all ... thanks!",

I do have a suggestion however... Make it when fresh corn and tomatoes are in season. I used fresh corn and tomatoes but had to buy frozen lima beans. I doubled the recipe and with the vegies being out of season spent about 20.00 just to make it. That's ok this one time - it's a special occasion and everyone is going to love it! I had to find out how to skin the tomatoes because I didn't know. You wash them and remove the stem. Boil a pot of water deep enough to cover the largest tomatoe. Have a container with ice water with ice floating it it ready - also enough to be able to submerse all of the tomatoes you plan to do. Cut a small shallow x on the bottom of each tomatoe. Put them in the boiling water doing 1 at a time for 30 seconds (really just 30 seconds) and them put them in the ice water for 5 minutes. They came out beautiful! Thanks for a great recipe!",

However though I used the same ingredients I scaled down the recipe by half and then only used half of the amount of butter than was called for. I started one cup frozen lima beans in 1/4 cup (half a stick)of butter in a skillet over medium-low heat for about 10 min then I added two peeled and chopped tomatoes the sugar and one cup frozen corn and simmered it in the same pan for about another 20 minutes. I fail to understand why two pans are needed to prepare this dish. Still the flavor was sooooo good and the vegies retained their texture (except for the tomatoes).",
