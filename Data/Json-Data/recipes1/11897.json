First, the recipe calls for way too much Worcestershire in my view, so I reduced it to 1 T. I substituted fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder, and for a boost of flavor used a full envelope of packaged, dry Italian salad dressing mix rather than the bottled, adding some olive oil to compensate. I didn't bother with the honey marinade as it wasn't necessary, and just brushed some melted butter on the shrimp before serving. This had a mellow but perfectly adequate flavor, that did not overpower the shrimp.  I served this on a bed of Rice with Summmer Squash, also from this site.",

The only change I made to the recipe was to reduce the amount of worcestershire sauce in the marinade. I also cut the amount of basting sauce in half (using 2 tbs of butter, 2 tbs of honey, and 1 tbs of worcestershire sauce) and it was plenty. This came out so beautifully...the presentation was lovely, and the taste was out of this world! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...I'll definitely be making this again!!!!",
