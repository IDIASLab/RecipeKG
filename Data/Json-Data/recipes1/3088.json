Overdo it and the flavor is unpleasant and overbearing. I wanted this frosing to pipe onto cupcakes so I nearly doubled the powdered sugar called for and addded half and half until I got the thicker consistency I wanted.",

I used a stick of butter and a stick of criso butter flavored shortening.You would wanna beat the butter and shortening for at least 20 min. seems long but it's totally worth it. You won't taste that butter after taste! That's the main key. I used 8 cups of powdered sugar to make it thick but added more almond extract and a tsp. of vanilla extract so it wont be to sweet and lose itself in the sugar and focus on the main purpose of ALMOND BUTTER ICING!!!!! (Remember Beat the butter and shortening for 20 mins. it will taste way better! and if it's to thick for your taste and milk!)",

I didn't add as much extract to it almond extract tends to overpower things really easily so I just added to taste about 3/4 tsp. I have a new go-to cake frosting.
