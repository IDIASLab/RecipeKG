I had my Italian uncle and aunt over and they loved it served on toasted bagette bread for crostini appetizers.",

Cooking with your general curly-leafed parsley used for garnish in many Western nations will give you little flavour. Italian parsley however is much closer to cilantro and Chinese parsley is EXACTLY the same thing as cilantro. In regions where the latter are used commonly for cooking some people simply call it 'parsley'. Different places different names ('cilantro' by the way is also called 'coriander' in an many Asian nations). This is meant to be a simple pasta and with the right type of parsley it is just that.",

Use fresh tomatoes (and if from your garden- at no cost!) and dice the herbs and spices are already on most pantry shelves - no special trip to the store! Best of all - it tastes GREAT. My DH hates peppers and I can't tell you how many times I've got to skip over salsa because it has them - he cant even stand the smell of 'em. so for us this is THE recipe. I do add diced onion red or sweet or both! and I do add a bit of hot sauce sometimes for zip but this is the rock upon which I build my salsa! thanks Lila!",
