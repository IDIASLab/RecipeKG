I only had to bake it for five minutes longer and they came out so fluffy and light. Instead of just a cup of pumpking I added at least another fourth for more flavoe and a half cup of oats. Though I think next time I'll add a full cup.\nDefinitly making this again- we loved it so much my boyfriend is taking a bunch to work for everyone to try :)",

The only things I did different is first I used pumpkin pie spice and then I heated up a can of cream cheese frosting for like 30 seconds and drizzled it over the cookies. Then I put a whole pecan on top. They were pretty and delicious. I made them the first time this last weekend and now my hubby wants me to make them for his shop for their Thanksgiving lunch. I am off to make them again now!",
