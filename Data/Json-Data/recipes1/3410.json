First of all, I used 2 squashes..cleaned and cut into 8 pieces..roasted them with olive oil, salt,and pepper and smashed garlic cloves for an hour in the oven..350. I then removed them from their skins..sauteed the onion and added 1 c. apple cider in addition to the chicken broth...and one peeled, chopped granny smith apple...and nutmeg, salt and pepper. I also have to say that I didnt use any of the cream cheese...the puree was perfect without..but I think I will add a small amount of 1/2 and 1/2 for a little richness. Excellent soup...thick, creamy and rewarding even if you dont use the cream cheese...way to calorie concious. Puree' in small batches in the food processor...be careful if its too hot!",

I roasted the sqaush on a sheet in the oven (cut in half and roast cut side down) for about 45 minutes at 375 because roasting brings out the flavor better. (Plus it is a lot easier than cutting an uncooked squash).  I used butter because I never use margarine, and I added slightly more cayenne than called for.  Everyone wanted the recipe.

I made this the first time, with home made chicken stock (no salt, better flavour) and only one pkg cream cheese, 3x the amount of cayenne (we like a little spice).  It was to DIE for.  Used a hand blender to puree, turned out perfect, can't understand how anybody could have grainy soup, unless squash is 'old', which can happen this time of year...we found 1 pkg cream cheese was plenty with the proportion of stock listed.   The next day, was even BETTER, mellowed out, but seemed thicker-so we used (skim) milk to thin own a tad.  Next time I  made it, I doubled the stock, and added 2 pkg cream cheese.  Still outstanding!!  For me, a nice bowl of this and fresh sourdough bread is a comforting meal.  Used light cream cheese, worked out just fine.  Not to mentiuon this was SOOOOOOOOO easy!!!!! We will make this again...and again...and again....",

I left out the cream cheese ( greatly reduces fat content),  added in one pear ( or an apple can be used), and one potato ( a weight watchers trick,  gives soup the illusion of being more creamy).  I also broke up some spagettini into one inch bits and added this during the last 8 minutes of cooking.  Gives a different texture,  really great soup!!!!!",
