Because the recipe calls for 3 cups of vegetables to begin with and most people said that it's not enough I usually use 5-6 cups of vegetables. I use everything from broccoli to mixed veggies to corn basically whatever I've got in my freezer at the time. Also I cook the biscuits while making the stove top portion then when the stove top portion is done I dump that into a serving platter/baking tray and put the cooked biscuits right on top. Now it's ready to serve without needing to be baked in the oven.",
