This recipe is too moist not like the famed- whichever you take that to be. This cake tasted somewhat like a box mix- the flavors were not as deep to me probably a result of the quality of chocolate in the States versus Wien. If you use the whipped cream as is tradition do not sweeten it it overpowers the chocolate. The cake is not meant to taste like a Hershey bar as many Americans like. The difference is desserts are on a completely different level in Austria. Pastry and sweets are time-honored proud traditions- usually unchanged for centuries. On the up side i imagine this would be a nice deviation from a simple cake possibly for a birthday. I suppose i will simply have my Omi ship them to me in the States.",

I had a hard time cutting the cake in half but that might be my technique - someone told me that a thread works best to cut it in half but that did not work for me. The cake cooked in 30 minutes for me but my oven is weird (even with an oven thermometer) so I won't blame the recipe. It also shrank from the sides of the pan and I was worried that it might be too dry - it wasn't. I used saskatoon/raspberry jam instead of apricot because I didn't think I would like apricot.",

Don't freak out at the crackled crust on top when you pull it out of oven... icing covers it.",

It's the filling and the frosting that \"make\" this cake. It's to die for. My family calls it \"THE\" cake and make requests for it. I've made it for many a family and social gathering...it's always a hit. Sorry I cheat but time is short and this tastes like or better than a completey homemade cake...much easier and it NEVER fails! Very moist and absolutely to die for!!
