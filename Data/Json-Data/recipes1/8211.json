I brush the bottom of the crust with egg white before adding the filling. I also used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. To finish the pie for a picture perfect look brush the top with the remaining egg white and sprinkle with white sugar. Never a pasty dull looking crust will you ever have again. I always get \"oohs and ahhhs\". If you're creative you can cut shapes into the top crust before putting on the top like hearts. Save the cut out hearts to lay decoratively around the pie securing in place with egg white as \"glue\" and brushing the top of them with the egg white as well. If the crust starts to brown too quick lay a piece of aluminum foil over the top for the remainder of baking. Don't seal it on just lay over the top of the pie.",
