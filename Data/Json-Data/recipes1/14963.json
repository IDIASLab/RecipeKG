                "reviewBody": "This is a great beginner recipe, BUT...\nInstead of using GARLIC SALT, use fresh garlic. There is enough salt in the shrimp itself. If you need more salt, then add a few twists of the sea salt grinder -to taste (TT).  Also, add a hand full of fresh chopped cilantro and skip the cumin (cumin is over used in a lot of mexican dishes). Cilantro will give a great flavor to the dish and merries well with the lime and tequila. As far as adding more heat...GO FOR IT!!!\nI would use fresh serreno or habanera peppers for the connoisseur of hot, but if you like mild heat use the old standards -jalape\u00f1o or cayenne (fresh). If using that powdered cayenne- sprinkle on after grilling as a garnish. Remember, a recipe is only a guide. You can add and subtract from it as much as you want, BUT the intended flavors will change so ...remember to TASTE IT before marinating! Always remember...FRESH is the key ingredient to any marinade!\nOne last tid bit... yes it is true that the acid will cook meat and fish if left for a period of time (especially fish), but shellfish can stand a little longer. At the most, 1 hour will suffice for this recipe. Any longer, the shrimp will start to take on an unpleasant bitter taste - dont forget to remove any seeds from the lime as this will hasten the bitterness.\n\nHey 99burners... You over cooked the shrimp! That is why they came out rubbery!  3-4 minutes per side!",

I did add shallots and fresh garlic and marinated for 4 hours prior to putting on the grill and brushed with the left over marninade. Be careful when doing this as the olive oil and tequila will cause flare ups on the grill. \nI made enough for 50 people (12 lbs) and served on a cold plate sitting over ice. I never got to have any, they were a hit at the party. You know something is good when there is none left. We will definately be making again only next time just for us!! I'll post pictures soon.",
