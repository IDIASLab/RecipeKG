Also, instead of cottage cheese, I did 1 cup low fat cottage cheese & 1 cup ricotta.  Made sure to drain and dry out spinach and shells because I saw others experienced watery consistancy.  Turned out perfect!!!  Big hit with family and did freeze extras as recommended. Yummie...this is a keeper!!!",

I reduced the parmesan cheese to about 3/4 cup and added italian seasoning per other reviewers. I love tomatoes so I drained a can of diced tomatoes to add to the filling. Hubby and I both agreed it was the perfect addition!! Then I baked it for 30 min covered without the cheese and then added the cheese and baked for another 10 min uncovered. Delicious!",

There's only two in my household, so I just put enough shells to fill an 8-inch baking dish and covered them with a small jar of spaghetti sauce.  I took the suggestion of freezing the extra stuffed shells on a cookie sheet, then I put them all into a ziploc bag.  Now I can have stuffed shells ready whenever I want!
