                "reviewBody": "This tasted GREAT!  However, I'm rating only 4 stars because the recipe requires unnecessary ingredients, namely baking soda and cream of tartar.  I thought I would see if there was a noticeable difference in flavor and/or outcome with the combination of baking soda/cream of tartar as opposed to just baking powder.  \nThe cream of tartar (acid) is used to activate the baking soda (which requires an acid in order to activate).  Baking powder would be easier/quicker to use and just as effective (so long as it's not expired) with equal if not better results(in my opinion).  I added a splash of vanilla and a tiny drop of almond emulsion (flavor) to the batter for some extra flavor.  Sifted powdered sugar on the entire funnel cake and served with cut strawberries and whipped cream.  My family LOVES this quick, easy, yet tasty dessert.  I made this for a diabetic friend once too - who loved it because it is made with very little sugar!  \n\nTIPS:  I find that sifting the flour. sugar, salt, and baking powder (or soda/tartar) together - and adding the milk/egg to the flour is best.  The batter is very smooth.  Also - I recommend using a cast iron skillet to fry as the iron maintains the heat/temp better than other pans when the cold batter is added to the hot oil.  ",

However I did add a splash of vanilla extract to the batter and it did take a little more milk than 1 cup in order to get it thin enough to pour into the classic funnel cake shape. This is good with the powdered sugar or sprinkled with a cinnamon/sugar mixture. This recipe says that it serves ten but it actually makes about 4 large funnel cakes which in my house serves about 7 or 8 people. Just something to keep in mind when you are figuring how much to make:) All in all a good recipe!",
