This recipe really requires a good thermometer -- either a $10 instant-read type or, even better, the type that pierces the meat and stays in place while connected to an outside-the-oven monitor. If you can swing that, then try your favorite marinade or rub on this recipe. Use your imagination on the rubs and marinades, but ensure you bring your roast directly from the fridge to the roasting pan -- Dad's recipe works best that way.",

(ALWAYS start with a really clean oven, which I did.)  I ignored my inner warning bells and pressed on.   After 15 minutes at 475, I had SMOKE, the kind of smoke that fills the entire house.  I had to abandon ship! The internal temp of the roast was only at 45 degrees.  I turned the oven OFF and did not open the door.  The meat sat in the off oven for another 15 minutes while I aired out the house, opened every window and the doors too.  (Thank goodness the neighbors didn't call the fire dept.)   At this point the internal temp was 76 degrees.  I removed the roast from the oven, turned the oven back on to 325 and allowed the pork to rest for 30 minutes as directed.  Placed the roast back in the oven and roasted to 140 (which seemed like it took forever)   I removed the roast at 140 and allowed it to rest and come to 145.  Was it moist?  Yes, but that is because it was not over cooked.  Would I recommend this method?  Never!   It is so easy to sear a roast and cook it low and slow, using the suggested probe thermometer.",

We make this all the time. We are a family of seven and raise pigs for 4H so lots of pork roasts! Turns out great every time. If you have any problems try checking your oven temp for accuracy and make sure you have a good meat thermometer. Thanks for sharing.",
