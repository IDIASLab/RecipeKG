Next time I make this I will do what I thought about doing and should have done in the first place which is to make a kind of roux with all of the wet ingredients then add the cheese in gradually until melted adding the broccoli last. That's the way I've always made broccoli Cheddar soup in the past and it has never turned out so disastrously as the method in thes recipe! It makes for a much smoother texture all around.",

I ended up adding some cornstarch to thicken it up. But overall it was incredibly easy and tasted great. I didn't have (nor have I ever seen) cauliflower soup mix so I used two chicken bullion cubes. Also don't throw away your broccoli stalks for this recipe. They're very healthy and you won't even notice them when cooked all the way through.",
