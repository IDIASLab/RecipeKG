I made one addition to the marinade--1/4 cup brown sugar--because I like a sweet-salty balance in my jerky. Followed the recipe to a T otherwise, and it's fantastic. I can't stay out of it! I did use a Sam Adams in place of the Bud because it's what I had on hand. I will absolutely make this jerky again! Thank you for the recipe!",
