I made exactly as the recipe stated with the addition of adding some sauteed white onion to the filling. I did have more than 1/2 cup of the sauce leftover so I just poured all of it on top of the enchiladas. My family was not a huge fan of these enchiladas and probably would not make again but I do think it would be an easy recipe for a starter cook.",
