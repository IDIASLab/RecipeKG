As to the baking time as with ALL cookies baking time will be effected by the size of your cookies what kind of cookie sheet you use and how accurate your oven is so don't really think that should be how you rate a recipe. I used a 1 tablespoon scoop as opposed to a spoon and got 60 cookies. I baked some on a dark non-stick sheet and those only took 10 minutes. I made some on a shiny \"air\" cookie sheet and those took 14 minutes to get brown but with either the taste was GREAT!! I used orange essense cranberries and natural applesause and couldn't be more pleased with the taste and texture. These don't spread much either so kind of \"patted\" the scoop down a bit to get a flatter cookie. Definitely a good recipe for someone watching their fat and fiber!!",

I suggest that if they seem a little uncooked in the middle that you put them back in the oven for another minute or 2. So in my oven they are having to be cooked for a full 10 minutes. Also I put twice the amount of chocolate chips. I and my kids still love them as much as the first time and I am taking them to a GRITS meeting tonight (Gals Raised In The South) so then I'll find out the true reviews.",

I don't know how you would make them chewy- they do have applesauce in them which to me means cakey! Besides that they are very tasty just not texture-wise what I was looking for. At least they're healthier than regular cookies. 1/2 cup butter for 35 cookies is great IMO. I'm thinking quick cook oats would have been better in these as well. Didn't change a thing except to add a little cinnamon and had to cook them longer.",
