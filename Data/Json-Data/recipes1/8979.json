Because I was testing this and had no idea of what they looked like yet I whipped up the batch as quickly as possible and then only cut the dough into strips and didn't make bowties. I also tried some cookie cutter ones they came out ok but I liked the strips better bc they puffed a bit when frying. It tasted similar to a funnel cake without the doughy part.....more like a crispy funnel cake. Since we don't usually have alcohol in the house I used Rum Extract in place of the rum or brandy...I believe you could sub ANY extract in place of that rum/brandy according to your tastes. I bet it would be great with almond extract or ginger extract...I can't wait to try it. This took me less than an hour to make. I still have a bunch of dough to finish up but for two plates it took less than an hour.",
