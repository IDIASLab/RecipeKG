I apologise if this offends but I played around with this recipe quite a bit. I bake a lot of cookies so I set out to fix the crumbling issue the other posters commented on and the turned out fantastic. Got my toddlers seal of approval. Here's what I did.  1/2 cup butter slightly cooler than room temp so still firm but able to be cut easily 1 cup brown sugar 3/4 cup peanut butter 2 eggs no milk 1 3/4 cups blended whole wheat flour 1/4 tsp salt 1 tsp baking powder 1 3/4 1 generous cup of grated carrots  bake @ 375 until golden around the edges and they look dry on top. My oven (gas) took around 15 mins. Cheers! 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips",

The first time I made these cookies I did it without the chips and they okay. The second time I made them with semi-sweet chips and some dried cranberries and WOW did the chips make a difference. These are really yummy don't be scared by how many different ingredients are in it! I will be making these again for sure.",
