I scaled this down to 1 1/2 servings, and it made enough for me and my hubby to share, since it's quite rich. You want to make sure to use a chocolate that you really really enjoy, as that effects the entire outcome of the hot chocolate. I used a 72% dark chocolate and loved how this turned out--rich, chocolaty, and not-too-sweet. One minor thing is that this will form a skin on top as it cools, so make sure to enjoy it immediately. Great recipe! Thank you so much!",
