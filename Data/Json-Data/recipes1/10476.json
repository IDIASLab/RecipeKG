I subbed in rotini and frozen peas since it's easier to eat than fettuccini and canned peas gross me out. I drained the pasta overtop the peas so that they'd defrost but not really cook and added it to the sauce. Also threw in a handful of chopped bell pepper and onion I've been trying to get rid of and it added a little color. I'm not sure where the time of 35 minutes came from...it took me about 5 to chop the extra veggies while waiting for the water to boil 10 to cook the noodles and another 5 to heat up the sauce and throw everything together. I will definitely make this again.",

While the pasta boiled I heated the Alfredo peas tuna and dried herbs in a separate saucepan. I combined that with the drained pasta and topped each serving with a little shredded Parmesan cheese.
