You use double the Oreos but both sides adhere to the PB cup without having to melt it and the symmetry is more pleasing to the eye. That may be just me though...:P Regardless I use two cream sides of Double Stuf Oreos one PB cup then dip it in the chocolate and sprinkle a little something pretty on top. You'll be on a sugar high for hours. I imagine using white chocolate might be pretty spectacular as well.",
