The fresh beans were a bit pricey at 7 for about a cup and a half of shelled beans but we didn't mind the when we tasted them. Will definitely try this recipe with dry beans and see if it's as good as from fresh. We used dried rustico Italian seasoning and added fresh basil and we loved the lemon zest and juice but didn't over-do on it. Also used lots of bacon. This will be a new staple for our meals.",
