The recipe also doesn't say when to add the pasta to the cheese/veggie mixture--it just says to 'plate' it. I think the pasta really needs to be added to the veggie mixture once its done sauteing, and then add the ricotta mixture to fully coat the noodles. I also think this would be even better placed into a casserole dish, topped with the mozzarella and Parmesan, and baked until the cheese is browned on top. I would consider making this again, but I would tweak it for my tastes. Thanks for the recipe!",

At first I thought the ricotta mixture was not going to be enough to coat all of the pasta and veggies but it was perfect. I made it just as the recipe said, except I mixed the pasta in with the veggies and the ricotta mixture. I also baked some as another reviewer had suggested.. I feel that baking dried it out a little and muted some of the lemon taste. I love this recipe and will definitely be making it again. Next time I might add some chicken sausage for a little extra flavor.",
