I had defrosted a flank steak and was going to cook plain on the grill and then looked for a recipe containing flank steak.  I already marinated it with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and steak seasoning for a few hours so wasnt sure how it would incorporate into this recipe but it did.  Also instead of brown gravy I used a can of campbells brown gravy w/onions (i also didnt have wine but the seasoning from my marinade was enough) which gave it a fabulous taste.  I pounded down the meat as much as I could beforehand and also did additional seasoning of salt throughout to make sure it had flavor which it definitely did.  I had to do a bit of a butterfly cut on both sides of the meat to ensure that I had enough room to roll it with all of the stuffing.  I tied it with string and put toothpicks at the ends to be sure everything stayed in.  I also put a bit of mozzarella.  I cooked an hour and it came out perfectly and pretty tender, even my two young kids liked this recipe which is surprising as not alot of children like steak.  My family liked this recipe and I was pretty impressed with the results.  Dont hesitate to make this.  I now have something else to cook other than the normal boring things.",

As I only had a.95 of a pound of flank steak I had to recalculate for the 2 servings measurements. I used one cup of a stove top chicken stuffing mix. To this I added one stalk of chopped celery and half of a regular yellow onion which I sautee'ed both for a few minutes before adding it to the bread crumbs. Instead of water I just happened to have some College Inn Beef Broth opened so in it went! Pounded meat then seasoned both sides with some Mc Cormicks Steakhouse Grinder Seasoning and Fresh Cracked Pepper. Did'nt add any additional salt as the butter is salted and so is the broth. To a jar of Heinz Savory Brown Gravy went in the wine parmesan cheese and garlic. Top back on I gave it a good shaking notice how you dont have to use a separate dish for this step;-) Served over egg free noodles with some french style green beans drool This truly is Ambrosia at its finest and I highly recommend eveyone try this recipe! P.S. please please please make sure to let the steak rest for awhile before slicing it helps keep the stuffing intact!:-)",
