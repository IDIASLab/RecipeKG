Let proof for 10 minutes then add the salt, oil, zucchini, seeds and seasoning.  I added 1 1/2 tsp of dried basil and a tsp of rosemary like someone else suggested, then your flour.  Let rise for 1 hour, punch down and divide into 2 loaves and let rise again in bread pans for 45 minutes.  Bake at 350 for 35 minutes.  Brush tops with olive oil after it comes out of the oven and EAT!!!  2nd batch: Doubled it again and used only 1 tsp of salt, 2 tsp of italian seasoning and 2 tbsp of sesame seeds (as well as 2 cups of grated zucchini).  It rose much higher this time.",

The PERFECT toast bread if you don't like a sweet breakfast! You can't tell that there is zucchini in it at all! (My husband didn't believe me until he watched me make the second loaf.) I used a full cup of zucchini (EDIT: I don't even measure the zucchini anymore, I just grate one medium 'zuke and put it in the pan first.) I added a little oregano and minced garlic along with the basil to give it more of an Italian taste (definitely use fresh basil if you can). I have given away 6 loaves of this recipe and keep getting requests for it.",

I felt it could do with much more fresh basil for flavour. Otherwise a reasonable bread crumbly but thick. Best for toasting. I made another loaf just with basic white bread recipe but replaced just over 1/2cup water with a medium zucchini grated. It was delicious and rose well.",
