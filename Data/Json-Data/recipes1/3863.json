I use the filling (always a double batch) with any kind of cake and layer it with fruit usually strawberries or raspberries. To prevent the cake from absorbing the juice and color from the berries I spread a thin layer of the frosting on the bottom of the cake layer before I put it on top of the fruit which already sits on a thick layer of frosting. The raves I get from this are unbelievable. My nephew who doesn't eat desserts asked for a second helping. My boss--who is stingy with compliments--took a bite stopped forgot himself and raved about it. And EVERYBODY asks for the recipe. When I offered the recipe for the filling only they didn't understand. Use the filling with ANY cake ANY fruit or use your imagination with chocolate nuts or other flavors. Once the finished cake is refrigerated the filling sets to a wonderful texture lighter than your average frosting but firmer. If you want to impress somebody use this filling.",

Like others I would just make a few minor modifications: (1) If you have the time I recommend making the chocolate cake from scratch using the \"Dark Chocolate Cake I\" recipe from \"Carol.\" You will either need to customize that recipe to make enough for two 9-inch round pans instead of the three called for OR you can use the extra batter to make cupcakes! (2) As others have noted you should absolutely double the other ingredients for the frosting. Otherwise there will not be enough to properly cover the top layer and sides. (3) I feel that one 1-ounce square of chocolate is not enough to make the shavings. I'd use two! Also I've found that it helps to microwave (or otherwise warm) the chocolate before shaving as this helps achieve the curls you want rather than just messy specks.",

I made it the day before and chilled it in the fridge so it would be firm. For the cake mix I used strong coffee instead of water to bring out the chocolate flavor and added chocolate chips. The cake was so fudgy and moist and the filling complimented it beautifully. I also layered in sliced strawberries. Cutting the two cakes in half was not the most fun lol. But the cake turned out gorgeous! Everyone raved about how it looked and tasted. My brother said it was the best bday cake he'd ever had:)",
