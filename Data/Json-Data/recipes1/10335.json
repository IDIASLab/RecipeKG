First I cut the recipe in half and only used 1/2 of the sugar called for and onion salt instead of an onion. I put everything in my food processor and added the canola oil a little at a time. When it was completed I decided to add about twelve large basil leaves from our garden which had first been slivered. OUT STANDTING TASTE and I loved the light green color. I found my creamy basil recipe... so glad I found the original recipe.",
