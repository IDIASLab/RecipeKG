Opened up my Kumamoto oysters on the grill (about 5-7 min as my grill was on 400 degrees). During that time melted Smart Balance and Herbs de Provence (sp?) as I had no fennel seed. Used about 1/2 cup Smart Balance following a different review the Kumamoto's are smaller oysters. Then cracked open and added the oysters to the butter in the saucepan. They were so good I ate them right from the pan!!! My hubbie doesn't eat oysters so they were just for me anyway! I would omit the salt next time oysters are salty enough the way they are! Overall great idea!",
