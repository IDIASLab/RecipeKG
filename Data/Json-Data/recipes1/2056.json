                "reviewBody": "My family is Czech, so I make these often. I use softened butter instead of shortening. Using bread flour instead of AP makes for a lighter, flakier kolache. After you put the yeast in with the milk you need to let it sit atleast 10 minutes until it starts to foam. Also the milk temp should be close to 110 degrees (2 min in the micro is what it takes for me). Too hot and you kill the yeast, not hot enough it will not activate. Add about 3 cups of flour, form a ball, then take it out of the bowl and work the rest of the flour in on the counter. Add additional flour if necessary, but it should still be a little sticky. The reviewer that said this is a batter did something terribly wrong. This is a bread dough type of consistency. Don't \"flatten the balls\". Instead take your thumb and index fingers on both hands and push the dough out from the center. This will create a deep well with tall sides so that the filling doesn't ooze out. Then I brush mine with melted butter and fill with about a tablespoon or 2 of cherry pie filling (or whatever you like). I am impatient on the 2nd rise, so I place the kolaches in the oven with it on low (170 degrees) for 20 minutes. That will make the second rise go much faster. Then preheat the oven to 375 and bake for about 15 minutes. Should be light golden.  I get the best results with an airbake cookie sheet. Dark colored ones will burn the bottoms of the Kolache. This recipe makes about 40 kolaches, not 72. I get 12 per cookie sheet.",
