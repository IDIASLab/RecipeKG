I used the white frosting II/wedding cake icing recipes from this site to put a thin layer of icing on first. Used a paper pattern to cut out the hexagon and pentagon shape. Traced onto the cake with a toothpick. Used a regular tip to draw the outline on the ball blue (colored small amount of icing). Used a star tip to fill in all the white parts of the cake with the remaining icing. Lastly I placed coconut in a ziploc bag and put in some green food coloring to coat. (the grass around the ball). My 15 year old son who LOVES soccer LOVED this cake for his birthday",

I totally overlooked the toothpick trick and used clear gel and the template to put my markings on the cake. I'm sure the toothpicks would've worked better. I only decorated half the cake because the icing was warming up and I was getting worn out! Please ignore the \"grass\" as I'm missing the correct tip. I've just purchased fondant that I'm going to try out. I think the pattern will turn out better that way.",
