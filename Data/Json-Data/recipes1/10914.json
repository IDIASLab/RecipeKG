It should be called \"molasses pie,\" but it's whimsically named shoofly because its \"open\" structure lures flies that must be shooed away. Shoofly Pie is thought to be a Pennsylvania Dutch creation, and may be a direct descendant of \"Centennial Cake\" introduced at the first World's Fair -- the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition.",

Then keep alternating crumbs and liquid saving a handful of crumbs for the top.  Bake at 350 degrees for about an hour.",
