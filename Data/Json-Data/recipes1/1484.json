I added the sugar to the mixture 1/2C at a time and I ended stopping at 3 1/2C of conf. sugar. It was plenty sweet for me. The consistency was a tad watery with less sugar at room temperature so I chilled it in the fridge before spreading on my cake. Worked like a charm. Give this a try on the Lite Carrot cake on this site. A winning combination that's sure to please.",
