I read a lot of the reviews and made the following modifications: I used 1/2 a box of lasagna noodles. I reduced the mushrooms from 1 pound to 8 oz,in addition to the green bell pepper I added 1 large carrot shredded, and 1 medium sized zucchini chopped. I sauteed all of this & added 1.5 jars of spaghetti sauce (which I doctored up w/ season salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, sugar & fresh basil etc to taste.) I layered like this: sauce in the bottom of pan, noodles, ricotta cheese mixture -- which I added dry parseley to (approximately 1/2 tablespoon) and then I did a light layer of fresh chopped spinach and then the suace mixture and I repeated that. I topped mine w/ mozzarella instead of parmesan. It was really good. My changes SEEM like a lot but they are really small nuances that I added so my family would love.  They didnt even realize the amount of veggies they were eating. Everyone loved it. I made meatballs on the side for an extra but didnt even need them.",

I also felt 2 jars of pasta sauce would have totally drowned this lasagna, and I am a huge sauce fan and tend to use more than others. 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 was more like it. It also lacked spice, and I added several spices to the veggies while cooking them (garlic salt, onion powder, onion salt, garlic salt, parsley). I also used different veggies since I hate mushrooms: 1 red pepper, 1 onion, 1 zucchini and 1 package of microwaved frozen chopped spinach. I'm always trying to lighten things up a bit so I used reduced fat (not fat free) cheeses and only used 1 egg and it was really good.",

The veggies had a nice crisp still to them and not too mushy that way but it was enough to remove the moisture that can make your lasagna soupy, then I just layered the sauce, veggies without mixing them together.
