I used real minced garlic vs. garlic powder and subbed seasoned rice wine vinegar for the cooking wine.  I opted out of the cilantro and instead added thin sliced green onion.  I cut the chicken into chunks for kabobs and pierced it lightly with a fork to let the marinade soak through.  I put everything into a ziplock bag and let it marinate overnight.  I skewered the chicken along with fresh pinapple and grilled it.  The smell was heavenly and the result oh so delicious!",

I marinated a pork tenderloin and then made a fresh batch of the recipe and cooked it on top of the stove for a glaze to pour over the top of the pork.  All I can say is \"OH MY GOODNESS\"!!! I felt like a gourmet cook!  This recipe is a nice touch. I did do a couple of things different.  I used crushed pinapple which went nice with the chunks from the orange marmalade.  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I marinated it with fresh ginger slices and used ground ginger when I cooked it on top of the stove.  I even added a sprinkle of chinese 5 spice powder.  I didn't have the chili paste so I used a sprinkle of hot pepper flakes and the other thing I changed was instead of chinese cooking wine (which I could not find) I used white wine.  I just think the crushed pineapple added a nice texture to the glaze.  GREAT RECIPE!!!! 5+ stars!",

                "reviewBody": "Finally a marinade for teriyaki chicken that has a KICK and actually really tastes like something from a restaurant. I used fresh garlic and fresh ginger and used no-sugar added marmalade. I also cut down a bit on the brown sugar. I'll admit that I didn't use quite the full amount of garlic-chili paste but I was close! I doubled the recipe before I even started based on several reviews. I knew I'd want some to cook down as a glaze after I cooked the chicken. I let three chicken breasts and several pieces of tofu marinate for about 3 hours and then grilled it all. The chicken was tender and delicious and I can't wait to eat leftovers with more of the glaze. We served this with baked crab rangoon and asparagus roasted with lemon/orange pepper. My family ate brown rice with theirs. Everything was wonderful and we'll definitely have this again and again. Thank you for a wonderful recipe...one of my favorites of all I've ever tried on All Recipes!",

My husband loves spicy foods and this is now one of his favorites! I couldn't find chili paste with garlic so I just added a little extra garlic powder. Also couldn't find chinese cooking wine or any cooking wine for that matter (living in England!) so ended up using white wine vinegar and it was just fine. Also used crushed pineapple as some other reviews suggested. Used half of the recipe as a marinade for chicken and heated the other half for a glaze. To make it less hot cut the chili paste in half or to cool it off a bit reserve some crushed pineapple to top your dish with before serving!",

Served with this site's \"Fried rice with cilantro\" (the rice is amazing!). The glaze was pretty good The flavors were pretty muddled together nothing really popped out I don't think I'll make it again for pork maybe chicken.",
