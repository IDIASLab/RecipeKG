The only thing I do differently is instead of refried beans, I add 1/2 to 1 lb of hot sausage with the ground beef to add some more heat and flavor, and makes it a little meatier.  He always loved it with the refried beans but raves about it now with the sausage! Thanks Amber for the great recipe!--also wanted to add that I use part sour cream and part cream cheese to make that middle layer a little creamier!",

I used a mix of  shredded \"taco cheese\" (a blend of cheddar, Monterey Jack, Colby cheeses and spices) and shredded cheddar cheese. I used about 2 cups of cheese before baking and then added the rest about 5 minutes before removing the dish from the oven. This dish took me about an hour to prepare the first time and about 10 minutes to cool, so I would budget time accordingly. Thanks so much for thus great recipe! ",
