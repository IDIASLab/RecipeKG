If you leave the sheets UNGREASED they will turn a nice medium brown on the bottom instead. Next I added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla for a little more flavor. Finally I made a second batch leaving out the raisins and nuts which we liked even better and made them more toddler friendly. Over all a good soft not too sweet cookie.",
