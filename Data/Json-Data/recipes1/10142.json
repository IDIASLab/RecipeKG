I switched the regular corn to Mexi corn (has red and green bell peppers in it).  I used the hot green chili peppers instead of the mild.  I added a teaspoon of cumin to the ranch salad dressing.  We all liked it even better the second time (with the extra spice).  \r\nNext time I make it I'm going to use pico de gallo (chunky salsa) instead of just straight tomatoes.",

I used 1 package Ranch dressing, 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream. Also added a bit of cumin,oregano and chili powder. Try different cheeses...Monteray Jack and mild cheddar are nice.  I prefer making this the day before as all the flavors blend. You'll get raves from this easy, colorful and scrumptious\r\nsalad.  A big winner in my book!!!!!",

I added teh chiles TO the corn bread mix along w/ a little taco seasoning to make a mexican corn bread.  I also used 1 can black beans instead of pinto, layered w/ romaine lettuce, real bacon instead of the bits and use Montery Jack cheese instead of plain cheddar.\r\n\r\nOverall this is a great salad that you can adjust to your own liking!  It does make a huge bowl, so make sure you've got plenty to eat it!!!",

This salad is FANTASTIC and I have made it over 6 times for different occasions. I HIGHLY reccommend that you try this and have some fun with it. Some substitutions I have made are using differnet Ranch dressings (a spicy Texas ranch was a HUGE hit) plus I've changed the beans from pinto to black beans I've changed the cheese. It's very flexible so have fun! Really though...it's FABULOUS! make it make it make it!!! Oh yeah also I make/serve it on a really big colorful platter and garnish it with a red or green jalapeno pepper.ENJOY!!!",
