Cover pie with foil only if it's getting too brown.  Everything else is the same.  The crust is out of this world.  It's tender and flakey and is perfect for those who hate to roll out pie dough.  I use it for all my baked custard pies, like pumpkin and pecan, because it doesn't get soggy.  Excellent recipe. Updated since 2011:   I have started using a streusel topping on this pie..Use your favorite streusel, brown or white sugar.  I use white sugar and crush some sliced almonds into it. Makes it look so pretty and adds a little crunch to the top.",

But the center seemed runny so I baked another 15 minutes but the same thing? I figured the egg/cream mixture had to be cooked so I removed it! Thankfully I did! I let it cool to room temp. and then let it set up in the fridge. It was so Delicious!!! Very creamy! I think my peaches were very ripe which is why there seemed to be more liquid on top but it did not affect the final outcome this will be a favorite around here for sure!",

The pie crust is flakey and buttery and the pie is the perfect balance of tart and sweetness. Although the recipe is simple and easy to make, you can tell after the first bite that every ingredient\u2019s main purpose is to highlight the natural flavors of the peaches. They key here is to use fresh, ripe peaches! Don't use canned or frozen and don't use skim sour cream... there's a reason for each ingredient. If you absolutely must add your own flare, I suggest spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, etc... but I insist you try it at least once as is, you won't be disappointed!",

I fully intended to give half of it away, but my husband wouldn't let me. I can't believe we ate the whole thing! I'm making it again this weekend for 4th of July, and I'm certain it will become a Thanksgiving staple.
