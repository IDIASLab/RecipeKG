Posole may be served as a main dish with tortillas or crackers. Posole can be found in the meat section if it is available in your area. If not available, hominy can be substituted in the same quantities but no rinsing or pre-cooking is needed. Add red chili sauce and leave the seeds in the peppers for a hotter/spicier taste. You can also add one can of tomatoes to enhance the flavor of the stew.",

My mother prepared posole every year for New Year's Day, and her posole was very similar to this recipe.  The pork rinds and feet make it authentic, but you can omit these ingredients for ease of preparation.  If you have trouble finding red chili, try www.buenofoods.com - a popular New Mexico Chili retailer.  My mother made a huge batch of milder posole, but served extra red chili sauce on the side so people could adjust the spicyiness to their taste. You can also slow-cook posole in a large crockpot for 6-8 hours until the porkloin falls apart.  Posole is sooo good on a cold winter's day.  If you love spicy food, chili or the unique flavor of red chili, you should try this dish.",

This reminded most of hers although I did change several things using indredents I remember her using. First was the meat. She puts this pork called espinaso which you can find in you hispanic market @the the meat counter. And we also add a few skinlesschicken thighs and I put just a small abount of pork sholder (about half a small roast &a I freeze the other half for next time) I do this because I am not a fan of meat w/everyweek bones and fat and all that ( I call it creepy meat lol) I use either dried California chilies or New Mexico Chilies she says they're basically the same but the New Mexico are sort of a better quality although I believe they're the same price. I serve it with thinly sliced radish rounds chopped cilantro & white onion shredded cabbage lime wedges and we eat it with sliced birrote (the mexican bread you use to make tortas)",
