It's like a thicker, stiffer whpped cream.  Not as pudding tasting as bavarian cream but not as thin as a whipped cream icing.  Perfect for a strawberry shortcake.  I used it on the Coconut Cream Cake I from this website and the taste was to die for.  My husband brought that cake with this frosting into work and every co-worker asked for the recipe.  And the fact that it takes about 2 minutes to make makes it a 10 star recipe in my book. Another reviewer commented that this is \"artificial tasting.\"  Let's be honest, if you like cool whip you will LOVE this recipe.  If you are expected this to taste like real heavy whipped cream, you are being unrealistic.  I love cool whip; it's light, it's not as fattening and this frosting really holds it's shape well. Not runny at all.",

Just substituting 8 oz. of fresh, whipped cream for the Cool Whip would be a vast improvement. There are few instances where there are any acceptable substitutes for fresh ingredients.",

No one in my family likes the store bought icings which are way too sweet, and I never had any luck with just using whipped cream as it melts away way too fast.  This recipe was just right in between.  Not too sweet and held up well on the cake even icing it the day before and leaving it in the fridge over night.  I used it for a home made birthday cake for my son's 7th birthday party and all the kids loved it. It tasted delicious.  I will definitely use this for all cakes in the future.  Thanks!!",

The first batch I made was way too runny for piping so I decided to make the second batch with only 1/2 cup milk.  This was too thick for my liking.  So I combined the two batches together and it was perfect. I found out very quickly that I could not frost the two cakes I panned on making.  I made a two layer cake and also used the frosting for the filling.  I had to go very thin on my cake so I had enough to pipe with.  This worked for this cake because I used crumbled cookies for the sides and cherry pie filling for the top.  So other than desired consistancy and the amount wanted, this frosting tasted fantastic.  When I read other reviews I had to laugh.  If you dont want your frosting to tastes like cool whip or pudding, then do not pick a recipe that only has cool whip and pudding as its ingredients.  Just a suggestion :)",

The only reason I rated this a 4 instead of a 5 is because I made it with real whipped cream instead of nasty store-bought cool whip.  I added red food coloring and refrigerated before frosting my strawberry cake.  It was soooo smooth and easy to handel.  Made a beautiful icing with the perfect whipped consistency.  My guests who ate the cake could not get over this frosting and said it was the quality of a fine bakery.  Thank you so much for this recipe, I will be using this from now on and am looking forward to playing with different puddings and flavors!",
