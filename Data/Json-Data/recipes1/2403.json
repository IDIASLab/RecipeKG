I omitted the almond center and added chocolate chips. I will add that my oven broke down before cooking these so I had to dust off my muffin maker and use it. Maybe this is the reason they didnt come out as good as I hoped as I have never been happy with how the muffin maker cooks them.",

Cooked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees a they were great! I would recommend trying this and I will be using this recipe again. Maybe for the office christmas pot lunch party!",

I made the coconut filling and chilled it then made little balls and chilled those before I put them in each batter cup. The problem I had with these was a lack of flavor in both the muffin and the coconut filling. I think I should have used some sweetened condesed milk instead of water and powdered milk with the coconut and maybe more chocolate to the muffin batter too. Thanks so much for sharing.",
