We don't love ranch dressing so I added some Franks Hot Sauce pepper and celery salt to the dressing and that tasted great.

I used red onions (they're a lot stronger so I used far less than the recipe called for) because Vidalia Onions aren't in season.

I also broiled the chicken rather than grilling it (b/c of the snow) which worked just fine.",
