Using an 8 inch dish you have to cook 35 - 40 to get it done all the way through, then the edges and bottom are - while still edible - burnt.  I liked the sweet flavor, but the texture was just not really a cornbread texture.  I liked this well enough because I poured chilli over it, but when I tried it bare, it was too much like eating cake.  This is, indeed, the cornbread for people who DON'T like cornbread.  As many have pointed out, it is similar to Marie Calendars in flavor, but I usually use Marie Calendars mix for cornbread, and the texture is COMPLETELY different.\r\n\r\nNote: Made it the second time with 1/2 cup less flour and 1/2 cup more cornmeal and the texture was MUCH better",

I did cook for add'l three minutes. we made this sunday with the chili recipe on this site..it's listed just as chili...but if you type in a few ingredients in your search, it's made with dark beer and coffe amongst other amazing ingredients...takes minutes to prepare, 2 1/2 hours to cook and we've been making it nonstop since last fall...a winner for sure teamed with this cornbread! thanks!!!",
