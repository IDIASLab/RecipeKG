Water an 8oz bottle of clam juice 1 quart of Heavy Cream 1 Cup of Butter and 1 Cup of Flour and all the other ingredients listed in the recipe.

I was definitely worried about my family of five eating it all before it went bad...until I took the first bite. Oh my! Soooo good! Thank you for adding this to allrecipes!! LOVE IT! I can my potatoes so didn't add those until everything else was added because they are already soft. Only variation I made.:)",
