I have been looking for a chocolate pinwheel cookie recipe that calls for cocoa instead of chocolate chips or baking chocolate both of which are expensive and difficult to find where I live. Since I couldn't find one I adapted this recipe and it turned out great! I mixed the wet ingredients and then divided the mixture in half and added half the dry ingredients less two tablespoons of flour along with 2 tablespoons cocoa to one half of the wet ingredients and the rest of the dry ingredients to the other half of the wet ingredients. I will definately make these again.",

I used powdered unsweetened chocolate approx 4-5 tablespoons and 4-5 teaspoons of white sugar instead of squares. I took a members advice and rolled the dough out between 2 pieces of parchment paper. No need for a floured work table and floor getting dusted. To prevent slippage I held the ends of the paper down with one palm and rolled a wooden rolling pin down the length of the paper. After a few attempts the dough softened and I got the knack of it. I kept the paper on the bottom to transfer it and flip it onto the other rolled dough. Easy neat and hygienic. Rolling was sushi-style. I used the cutaway edges to briefly mix the 2 doughs together into a ball then partially flatten. This made a marblized design. I will be making these again for Easter using pastel colors and different flavors.",
