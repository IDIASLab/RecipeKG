I then added about 2oz of cheddar cheese and  2oz mozzarella.  \r\nStuffed the raw \"boats\", sprinkled with parm. cheese, put in a baking pan with a little water on the bottom and baked in a hot oven.  They held their shape nicely, but were tender.\r\nI omitted the onion, salt, eggs, and butter. \r\nMy three childred loved them, and were actually fighting over the last one!  \r\nMaybe I should just submit this as a new recipe.

We followed the recipe, adding a bit here and there to account for the size of the veggie. It was easy to alter for amount, we didnt even really measure...other than to be sure we used at least what was in the recipe and roughly double for the size. We did add sausage for my hubby and everyone was pleased. We also sprinkled cheddar and bread crumbs on the top to give it a yummy crunchy coating, but the recipe was great as it stood! Thanks!",

Then I scooped out the pulp and chopped it up, leaving a semi-thin shell.  I sauted the pulp in olive oil with garlic and onion.  Next, I added some fresh basil, fresh parsley and dried oregano.  For color, I tossed in diced fresh tomato.  Next, I added about 1 tbsp. butter, bread crumbs, shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheeses.  Stuff the zucchini halves.  Then I put them in a baking dish with some water in the bottom and baked them at 350 for 30 min. I thik next time I'll use fewer bread crumbs and try adding in more tomato and maybe even some fresh spinach.",
