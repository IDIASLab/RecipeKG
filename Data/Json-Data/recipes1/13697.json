The pecans were so hard I could barely chew them and the raisins did not blend with the other flavors. I checked my usual pecan pie recipe and the recommended baking time is only 50 minutes. I can't imagine how awful this pie would have come out if it were to be baked for 90 minutes. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because my husband said that it was \"all right\". But then he doesn't mind burnt stuff. Will definately never make this again.",
