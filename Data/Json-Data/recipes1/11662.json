Although I'm a fish lover, I have to admit, the fillet smelled a bit fishy to me, so I soaked it in lemon juice as Charlie posted in 'Grilled Kingfish.' Please forgive me 1023, I usually don't alter recipes & then rate. Anyway, these enchiladas are fabulous & easy. I absolutely will make them again!
