We never use peeled potatos, just cook whole potatos, peel them pretty hot, cut and mix them with the sauce. Then they soak it up well when still hot. This is also too less sauce, we make a mix of hot broth and put in the vinegar/oil/salt/pepper/onion and pour it over the potatos. Broth as much as you need to make it moist and lightly creamy, depends on the potatos.. between half up to one cup and season it well so the salad doesnt get bland. And no.. not so much sugar. Max. 1 tablespoon. We dont like sweet salat. Add bacon at the end.. or whatever you like. We often put thinly sliced cucumber in it, maybe give it a try. Greets from Bavaria.. :-)",

I also used white vinegar as called for and not cider vinegar as some other recipes used. It was so good that I will probably never make traditional potato salad again. This is a lot easier too!

I am German/Irish and I decided to cook something German rather than Irish.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a go.  The only thing I added was a little celery seed.  There was a contest for the best dish brought to this luncheon.  Everyone there, about 40/50 people, placed their vote.  I was hearing everyone around me talking about how good the german potatoe salad was and to my surprise, I won first place and a $50 gift certificate.  So, this recipe is wonderful!  I'm making it again tomorrow for another luncheon, but there won't be any prizes this time.  Pretty good for someone who never made German potatoe salad before.",

                "reviewBody": "I lived in Basel, Switzerland, for 16 years and spent a lot of time right over the border in Germany. They have great salads, meats, dairy's (oh dear!) and breads! My ex German mother in law made a great potato salad, but I have to say that for my own taste buds, this blew hers right out of the water.  Be sure to curb the sugar to taste, however.  Go slow as you go, tasting it.  \n\nOne major potato rule, especially for those who found it too dry, is that baking potatoes are starchy.  Use Yukon, Charlotte, or New Red potatoes, as they are waxy...meaning they don't fall apart or lose their texture, but they also allow the dressing to rest on top rather than being absorbed and disappearing, causing the potatoes to get dry.\n\nToo bland? Peel and slice the potatoes to quarter inch thickness and boil them in broth: they'll absorb the flavor very well :) \n\nFor those reviewers who found it without texture, try adding yellow mustard seed...just a pinch, and thinly sliced celery over a mandolin or celery tops, finely chopped and freshly sliced green onions :)  That's my rant! I loved this, but do curb the sugar! And, yes, you can whisk in an egg into the dressing, giving it a creaminess as long as you let it set in the pan a minute or two to cook. There are so many ways to make German potato salad, so please appreciate the variations and have fun with them! If you can't say anything nice, why say anything at all? Cooking is fun! And thank you for the recipe!",
