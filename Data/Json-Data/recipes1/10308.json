One change  I make is using thinly sliced apples instead of the onions. I also RINSE my sauerkraut lightly in strainer. Other variations we also love is using kielbasa or beef smoked sausage.  I cut pieces into 1/2\", layer a small amount of sauerkraut on bottom of crockpot, then some sliced sausage, then thinly sliced apples, then small amount of brown sugar.  I repeat this until everything is inside.  I always end with sauerkraut on top so the sausage doesn't become hard and overcooked. Before eating salt and pepper to taste.  It's even better the NEXT day!",

My complaint was that I did add a few (3 small) diced potatoes to this (as someone suggested) and after 3 hours on high they weren't finished cooking so it went another hour or two on low and by then the potatoes and kraut were done but the sausages were WAY overcooked. I think next time I'd add the sausages in the last 2 hours of cooking and then everything would be done at the right time.",
