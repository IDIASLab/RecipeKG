The only thing that the frying does is make the shells crispy and add a whole lot of fat (1 cup oil is too much fat).  You can get the same crunchiness by scooping out the potato shells and baking them in the oven for 45 minutes at 400 degrees.  Then add the bacon and cheese and broil another 5 minutes (watch so the cheese doesn't burn).  Trust me, why add the fat?",

This is a great recipe as written, but I played with it just a little and was CRAZY happy with the result. I baked the potatoes in the oven early in the day (425 degrees for an hour) and left them on a rack to cool completely. About an hour before frying, I scooped out the flesh and sealed the shells in a zip-lock so they wouldn't dry out. I deep-fried them, seasoned with salt and cracked pepper, filled with sharp cheddar, and baked as instructed for 7 minutes. After removing from the oven, I sprinkled with lots of finely chopped green onion and more cracked pepper. I arranged the skins on a platter with a bowl of sour cream, and drizzled with a tiny bit of white truffle oil. Oh, MY. This isn't something I'll make often, but when you're in the mood for wicked, cheesy, over-the-top indulgence, this is the way to go. Misty, thank you for your wonderful recipe. You made us very happy!",

I brushed the inside with a bit of olive oil and baked for about 10 minutes at 425.  I then had added the cheese & bacon into the scooped out portion of potatoes and mixed well, filled the skins with the mixture and then topped with just a bit more shredded sharp cheddar.  After baking for about 10 minutes I turned the oven to broil and broiled just until the cheese was perfect.   Served with fat-free sour cream and diced green onions.  Needed a bit of salt and pepper and they were FANTASTIC!!!",

They were super crunchy and when tossed in a salt blend (I tossed then in 1 teaspoon of chicken salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of regular salt) and didn't bother with the bacon or cheese they practically flew out of the serving dish!!!
