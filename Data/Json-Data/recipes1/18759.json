The recipe worked exactly as written but I can't say the spicing was sufficient to give it any taste.  When I put so much prep time into it, this was really disappointing.  Perhaps adding a little real onion and garlic would make it better, as well as other spices you prefer.  I also think adding a tiny amount of \"heat\" via hot sauce or cayenne pepper would make this excellent.  Putting mashed potatoes in the bottom was a good idea, but I did have to take the biscuits off to the side because nobody wanted to combine potatoes and biscuits in their mouths!  This does have promise but I would not make it as written again.",
