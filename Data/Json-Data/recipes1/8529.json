I used freshly-chopped strawberries instead of frozen, and I\u2019m wondering if the frozen berries may have contributed to the firming-up problem??  I made adjustments based on reviewers\u2019 comments, and the following made a perfect filling:  chopped strawberries (not frozen), 12-oz. of strawberry non-fat yogurt, 1 sm. pkg (.30 oz) sugar-free strawberry Jell-O\u00ae, .25 oz pkg unflavored gelatin, and 8-oz tub of lite frozen whipped topping.  This took no time at all to make, set up well and  was fruity, creamy, light, and tasty.  Definitely would make again with the modifications above.",
