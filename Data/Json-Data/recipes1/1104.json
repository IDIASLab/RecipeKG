I make mine just a little differently, although the basic idea is the same.  I use 2 c. of the mini marshmallows and 1/4 c. butter to the 4 c. of chow mein noodles.  Not saying the way I do it is better than this recipe as is, it's just what has worked well for me.  I form the nests by filling sprayed muffin cups, then hollowing out the center while building up the sides with my buttered fingers.  Rather than jelly beans, I use Jordan almonds in a beautiful robin's egg blue.",
