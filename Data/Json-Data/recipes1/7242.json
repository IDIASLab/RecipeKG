I found that I had to increase/decrease some ingredients: I cut the sugar by 1/2C, increased the Poppyseeds to a 1/4C and I used 1/2C of real lemon Juice instead of the extracts as it has more flavour. I also put the rind of a lemon into the batter.(I also always mix my ingredients by wet then mix dry into it) I baked mine in a bundt pan for 1 hour & 10 min. It baked beautifully and turned a nice golden colour! Instead of the glaze I sifted Icing sugar on top.  It was very pretty and tasted nice too.",

I use a full 1/2 cup of lemon juice (the bottled juice is perfect for this), 3 teaspoons of poppy seed and buttermilk instead of regular milk.  The buttermilk improves the texture of the bread, creating a lighter, fluffier version.  If you like your bread a little denser, than stick with regular milk.  I baked mine in 2 loaf pans instead of three.  For the Glaze: 1/4 cup orange juice, 4-5 tablepsoons powdered sugar.  Don't use original recipe for the glaze, it's way too sweet.  Always use powdered sugar when making a glaze for ANYTHING. (3 star for original recipe, 5 stars for alterations.  Great base recipe though)",

                "reviewBody": "My whole neighborhood raves about this one!  Personally, I like bigger loaves so I use this recipe and pour it into 2 standard bread loaf pans (I personally really like the silicone ones for this recipe too) and I just have to keep checking with a toothpick in the center to make sure they're done after about 1 hour 10 minutes.  Also, it helps to microwave the OJ cocktail at the end before applying to the hot loaf right as it comes out of the oven....otherwise you'll never get the sugar to dissolve in 1/4C of OJ!!  \n\nAdded 8/11/07 - OK I have made this recipe about 30 times by this point and I can say each time I tried cutting back the oil, it came out dry and excessively dark on the sides.  Now I actually increase the oil slightly and the milk as well by maybe 1/4C each, and I have dropped the temp to 325.  For Jumbo sized Muffins this recipe will make exactly one dozen and you MUST increase the oil to 1 1/2C and the Milk to 1 3/4C and bake for 50 min at 325.  For bread, I don't do the 3 loaves, I pour it all into 2 pans and just bake it a little longer, checking with a toothpick.  Oh - I also increase the vanilla and lemon extract to 2 tsp each.  with the glaze hot and completely melted after heating in the microwave, I use a pastry brush and paint it on top, not once, but twice!

I divided the glaze into two parts. The first I used the 1/4 cup orange juice the juice of one lemon and 1/3 cup sugar. I poked holes in the top of the bread and poured the glaze on top. Once the bread was cool I made a simple powdered sugar glaze of about 1-1/4 cup powdered sugar 1-1/2 Tbsp. water and 1/2 tsp lemon extract. I was attempting to make the bread like what I always get at Caribou Coffee. It came out soooo good. Very lemony and moist and the frosting on top is a nice treat! I found that this recipe only made two loaves of bread and I baked them for 55 minutes.",

This gave the cake a delicate lemon flavor just right for my family's taste. If strong lemon taste is desired use 2 lemons. I've also tried making an all-orange version using the rind of the orange in the cake and the juice for the glaze. Still good but the lemon-inside orange-outside contrast was more interesting. Lastly make this cake in a 12-cup bundt pan. The cake comes out large and if baked to golden perfection it turns out so pretty! Lastly because other people said they had problems with the cake sticking to the bottom of the pan I use a brush to put on the glaze.",

This cake had an off taste to it. I think it had way too much oil. I used real lemon juice instead of extract. The cake had a play dough like taste to it. The consistency was dense. No one in the house liked it. I made it because I had no lemons or butter defrosted and I believed the reviews. But it was awful. I went to Martha stewart on line and got a different recipe with real lemon juice and butter which was a winner. Have used many recipes off here and this one was the worst so far.",
