I was hesitant to spray it for fear the meringue would break down, or not spread, but the absence of PAM makes it impossible to get out of the pan.  Will make again tomorrow and use PAM - it will surely turn out better than without it.  GREAT crust though.",

We are a gluten free household, so this is such a delight to have a crust and be able to use the fruits of season for deserts.  The toughest testers - 3 pre-teen boys... all said they liked the crust.  I put peaches on it that I had made with a gelatin while the crust was baking and setting.  Drizzled creamy sour cream over it and dusted with cinamon!  A total keeper.",

Place a large dollop of the prepared egg white meringue onto a cookie sheet lined with a flattened out sheet of a large brown paper bag like the kind from the grocery store. Using the bottom of a soup spoon to form a cavity in the center of the dollop, you can then bake as prescribed.  My mom used to call these \"Meringue Shells\" and filled them just before being served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with semi sweetened fresh raspberries. The shells will release fairly easy from the brown paper after cooking and drying out.",

I filled with an almond/cherry custard 1 hour before serving and the meringue was already getting soft and sticky. By the time 2 hours had passed all the tarts had to be eaten with a spoon. Awesome recipe but I will fill the shell(s) just before serving next time. Spray a generous amount of cooking spray. With just a split second spray some of the meringue still wanted to stick to the tart shells. Luckily I thought to pop the meringue out of the shells before serving (then reinsert) so guests wouldn't have to battle with the tarts. Several people went home with the recipe.
