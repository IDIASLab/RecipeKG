You don't have to change a thing although I did a little. i just cut back on the white sugar a little 1/4cup less and used sugar free vanilla pudding. I also used white whole wheat flour this made the batter a little dry so I added just a bit of milk for extra moisture. Delicious and alot easier than other chocolate chip cookie recipes. I like that they are crispy. Thank you you deserved your blue ribbons.",
