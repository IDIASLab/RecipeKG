For those who have commented on the sogginess - zucchini can vary greatly as to its moisture content; therefore you have to adjust your baking time accordingly. It is best if it is let to set at least 15 minutes before serving.  It is also very good cold or reheated in the microwave.  The garlic can very easily be adjusted more or less as to your taste.  I love it just the way it is written.  Thanks for the great recipe.",

As suggested by several other reviewers, I used a bit less garlic than the original recipe calls for (3 cloves instead of 4), and I used 2 full cups of Bisquik as opposed to 1 3/4. I might even used 2 1/2 next time, as it was definitely still more quiche-y than biscuit-y, as others have mentioned. Other slight variations I made were: I cooked at 425 for about 40 minutes, adding some sprinkled cheese to the top for the last 5 minutes of cooking, used dried chives in place of the parsley (I didn't have any on hand and thought the chives would spice it up a bit), used 3 eggs instead of 4, and I also added 2 tsps of paprika. It browned up spectacularly, smelled amazing, and disappeared completely once it was cut. I used my food processor to chop all the onion and zucchini which made this dish even easier to prep. :) Thanks, I'll definitely make this one again.",

I cooked it for a little over 30 minutes and thought it was still underdone when I cut into it but you need to let it cool considerably to set up. Once it had cooled more it was fine and ended up very moist. Might try adding more cheese to the top a few minutes before it's finished cooking since the husband and I love cheese so much but other than that it was great as-is!",
