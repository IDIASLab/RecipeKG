I did not broil just baked it at 350 for about 8-10 min. while my pasta cooked......and it was perfect.",

It does broil fast...so make sure you keep a close eye on it! It melts in your mouth and my family loves it!! I have also added thinly sliced tomatoes on top of the butter/mayo layer for a little variety and it was yummy! Thanks for a great and easy recipe! My family adores this...and so do I!!",

It was wonderful especially with the garlic. I used an artisan loaf of multi-grain sourdough. We had this with Wild Rice Chowder.",
