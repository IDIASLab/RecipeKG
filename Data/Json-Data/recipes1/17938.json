I have been searing as the last step until now.\n\nIn any event my finding is that I can buy less expensive cuts and get very tender meats with my sous vide oven.\n\nPerfect steaks -- every time!",

Needless to say, I know a little about steaks. I tend to shy away from NY Strips because they tend to be a little tough, I prefer Rib Eye.  I followed this recipe exactly using my crockpot and these were the best NY Strips I have ever had.  The only thing I did different was for the final sear, I used my charcoal grill.  About a min, minute and a half per side, make sure you season them before the final sear.  I've never had those kind of Mushrooms (Wegmans carries them) but can't imagine having a steak in the future without them.  Overall, well worth the effort.  Once you put the steaks in the water, they don't need much tending.  To make it easy, experiment a few days in advance with your crockpot to maintain 131-135 degrees.  I put mine on warm and tilted the lid a bit....maintained 132ish.....thermometer is very important.  Don't get wound up over the time....it's not critical.....if it goes three hours, won't change anything.",

I used 1 inch thick new-york strip loins, and maintained a constant temperature of 130 - 131 in my dutch oven.\n\nI first seared the salt and pepper seasoned steaks in a pan with olive oil, then transferred them into a zip lock bag and immersed them for 2 hours and 15 minutes. I proceeded to sear and crust the steaks after the immersion time. \n\nWhile the steaks were a perfect medium rare, I felt they lacked the depth of flavour I was expecting. \n\nWhen it comes to steak, I could have pan fried these strip loins and let them rest for 10 minutes and achieved as good or better results than the 2.5 hours using this method. \n\nIt was an interesting exercise, but not worth the time or effort in my opinion.",

I had two 1\u201d steaks, weighing ~1.5lbs total, and cooked them for 2 hours @ 130F in a sous vide appliance. The cook ended up being medium, which was too done for our tastes. However, they were still delicious, so I\u2019ll definitely be doing this method again; will just lessen the cook time. The mushroom sauce should not be dismissed! Yum!",
