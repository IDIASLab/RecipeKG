I added a lot more cheese than it asks for and I put in a variety of cheeses. I accidentally put the cream in at the beginning however I just kept the heat below a boil and there was never a problem. Also one change I did was that I used a jar of artichoke hearts. It cut down on prep time by a lot. The jar had some special flavoring so I didn't use any salt or pepper. Delicious recipe! _ I will make it for the second time right after I finish this review!",
