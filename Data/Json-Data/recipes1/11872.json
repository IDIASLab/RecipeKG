It adds so much flavor and it's not even salt/sodium laced. I did not have time to marinate (found this recipe while at work and cooked it that night) so I took the advice of others who were short on time - to bake in the oven covered with foil with all the marinade. I made sure to pound the chicken breasts thin for more even cooking - and because I prefer the thinner texture. I used a lot less white wine than called for (just enough to make sure the chicken pieces were sitting in it but not fully immersed by it) and I baked for 15 minutes at 350F and then increased to 400 for the remaining 10 minutes. Perfect juicy succulent chicken! I plated them and then spooned some of the liquids over each piece for extra moisture (not that it even needed it).:) The lemon pepper seasoning I have is McCormick's \"California Style\" which includes onion and garlic powders.. but it quite heavy on the peppery spice. I enjoyed it but it can be a bit much for those who prefer a more mild dish. Served with steamed asparagus a cucumber salad and half of a boiled sweet potato. Healthy tasty and a chicken recipe that will be in my binder forever. Thank you for sharing with us. Oh one last thing: Beautiful presentation.:)",
