I also used a whole stick of butter cut up on top.  When I checked it after it had baked 40 minutes, I noticed that some of the cake mix was still dry and crumbly.  I just put some pats of butter on those spots and baked it about 5 more minutes.  I will definitely be making this wonderful dessert again!!",

I went to two stores neither of which had mint chocolate chips so I used what I had on hand semi-sweet chocolate chips. Another reviewer mentioned that some of the dry cake mix was still visible on top so I sliced my butter into 12 slices hoping to get better coverage but that didn't work either. Not wanting to add more butter (this dessert is decadent enough) I drizzled a little FF half-and-half (was in the fridge) over those spots put back in the oven for five minutes and that helped. The devils food cake was OK with us and this cake is very easy to make but we thought it was W-A-A-A-Y too sweet. Doubtful I'll make it again.",

I did not use the mint chocolate chips either thank goodness (used regular semi-chocolate chips instead). I can't imagine the combination of those flavors. When I was eating this I felt like I was eating cake batter that's how rich it was and it dissolved in my mouth. I had to cook this for another 10 minutes and I think it could have cooked a bit longer but it was boiling over so I took it out. Afterwards I googled and found this is actually a variation of a dump cake which typically cooks for an hour. I like rich desserts but this was just too much. I won't be making this again. My son wouldn't even touch the cake and he usually eats anything. I ended up throwing over half of it away.",
