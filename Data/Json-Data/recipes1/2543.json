I took the advice of others and added 1 tsp of sugar and 1 tsp of salt to the flour and also mixed the oil and water until creamy before adding it to the flour. I found that following the recipe as is makes enough for one pie crust with a bit left over, so I make 1.5 of the recipe for 2 pie crusts. I have used this many many times and will continue to keep making it! Thanks!",

I did add a couple more teaspoons of flour as I rolled it out so that it wouldn't tear as I transferred it to the pie plate. But the end result is WOW. It's delicious! I used it to make an apple pie and sprinkled the top crust with a little sugar before baking. What a great recipe! Light, flakey, perfect. Even the bottom crust, which I was afraid would be soft, is firm yet delicate. I can't WAIT to make another pie with this recipe. It's a little intimidating as you're preparing it, but stick with it. The texture and flavor are among the best I've ever tasted.\n**just had to come back and add that my pies have now become famous in the neighborhood because of this recipe. Our friend has been heckling me all week from across the street to bake him a pie. \nThank you thank you thank you for this recipe. I will never use another one as long as I live!",

I mix it up quickly and shape it into an eight inch disk and place it in the fridge.(In plastic wrap) I roll it out quickly between two pieces of plastic wrap (I don't roll it with extra flour) The trick to this recipe is not to handle the crust too much and to keep it chilled.

I also added 1tsp each of salt and sugar to the flour as many others suggested. When you wisk the oil and ice water together it will turn white then add it slowly to the flour. If you have a dough hook attachment on your mixer this dough comes together in a few minutes. Very easy! I was surprised at how good it baked. I used the crust for the Luscious Chicken Pot Pie recipe on this site and it was excellent! The crust browned evenly on top and bottom no soggy crust here. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks Linda for a wonderful recipe!",

I was drawn to this recipe for its simplicity but I found out the hard way that trying to cut corners ended up costing me more time in the end. The crust was extremely susceptible to tearing and rather than turning out flaky it was crispy and overly oily. It was a mess to roll out even with the plastic wrap and it tore numerous of times. By the time I finally transferred the crust into the pan I was so fed up that I just gave up and slapped the strips of my lattice top on the pie haphazardly. I really did want this recipe to work out as I had wanted something without butter and it looked so easy but unfortunately this is not the recipe to use.",
