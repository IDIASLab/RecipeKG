I do a few things differently-I saut\u00e9 the onion in olive oil in a saucepan along with 1-2 cloves of chopped or pressed garlic. Then I add the other sauce ingredients to the pot. I also add some basil-maybe a teaspoon. I think the next time I might also use a little more macaroni maybe cook 9 oz instead of 8 oz. I also wonder if maybe ricotta cheese would be better than cottage cheese. Anyway it's a really good recipe.",
