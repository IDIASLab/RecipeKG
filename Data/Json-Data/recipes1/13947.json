                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe several times and had trouble with it from the beginning, but I made a few changes which helped.  1.)Two cups of flour left the dough too sticky for me, so I add about another 1/2 cup through kneading.  2.)I used olive oil to grease my pan and then sprinkled some cornmeal on top of that, then the dough for baking.  3.)This for me was the critical problem for this recipe... Many reviewers recommended partially baking the crust before applying the sauce and other toppings so it doesn't get soggy in the middle. I tried this and it simply didn't work for me. I ended up baking the crust initially for 8 minutes w/o toppings and then with the toppings for an additional 20 and the crust still wasn't done.  Now instead I bake it at 400 degrees without bothering to prebake and I don't have a problem with sogginess in the center. 4.) Also add 1/4 tsp each of garlic powder and basil to the dough, but that is a personal preference and doesn't add or take away from the original recipe as it is good without it.  I also like to pair this with the \"Best Marinara Sauce Yet\" from this site, which is very, very good.  Will make again, but with my changes.  ",

My husband and I loved this pizza last night. I read some but not all of the reviews before making this. Next time I will  try to make it in the morning and giv it more time to rise.  However out of options at dinner time, I did the 30 min rising and although it didn't rise much, I divided it and added flour, well floured the surface and rolled it out.  Luckily we like thin and crispy  and so it turned out great for us.  I also used a pizza pan with holes in the bottom which made it crisp up REALLY nice.  Dough was very tasty.  On the edges it was crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  Something I learned from my pizza waitressing days is, even if you like a lot of sauce hold back a bit more than you think. Sauce goes a long way and that may be why some of the reviews are stating that their pizza came out too soggy. I used the Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site and we loved it!   Thank you for the recipe!",

I used regular flour.  It came out great!  I added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp thyme and 2 tsps of italian seasoning.  I'm looking fwd to making again.  Next time I'll do as others suggested and use a pizza stone (need to buy 1) and use corn meal at the bottom of pan.  I'll also let it rise a bit longer and use 3/4 c of water for yeast mixture.  I am so glad that although I didn't do some of these things IT was a HIT!!!  Thank you!",
