So far I haven't used the whole bottle of dressing just in case it get's to be too soupy. It would be very good with any oil/vinegar based dressing and easy to use fat free to save calories...if one feels they must. I will like to eat this for several meals in the warm weather. I think I'll also make it for the next pot-luck. I think cubed jarlsberg cheese would be really tasty in this salad if you wanted to add a little protein.",
