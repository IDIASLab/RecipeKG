I recommend that you drain the chickpeas and lentils for awhile in a colander in the sink -- this prevented my salad from getting soggy.",

I made a couple changes because I forgot to buy some ingredients or they were not available. I substituted some sweet onion for the green onion- a red one would have been fine too. Also it's January so there are no real tomatoes on the east coast right now so I used canned tomatoes with jalapeno peppers (well drained) in place of the tomatoes and hot peppers- gave it the perfect amount of heat. This is a definite do again! Thanks for a terrific recipe!",

The peppers would be more colorful in the dish if chopped larger but that would add to the time. And it still presented nicely! I added extra cilantro and lime which was great and I used very mild peppers. My four year old liked to eat the lentils but nothing else. My husband and I love it!",
