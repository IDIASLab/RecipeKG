The chocolate took a long time to melt over low heat (about 18 minutes) but it also did not melt the marshmallows as I was afraid it would. I don't have a double boiler I just used the lowest heat setting and stirred it often. I left out the nuts due to possible allergies as these were for gift trays. I rolled the logs up in waxed paper and froze them overnight. They sliced easily the following morning straight from the freezer. Thanks for the great recipe. This was the first time I've ever made these and they were so easy!",

The recommendation from a previous rating to put them into wax-paper lined empty foil boxes (or cling wrap boxes etc) worked great. Also I used semi-sweet chips and they were fine.

And same for the marshmallows they have always been 10 oz bags. 2) this recipe leaves a lot unexplained for the process of rolling the log. I also agree with another reviewer that margarine works much better than butter for this particular recipe even though I am a huge advocate of using real butter otherwise. If you go with the 12 oz bag of chips 10 of marshmallow and use margarine this recipe will come out perfect. Just make sure you heat the chocolate and butter on a low setting so it doesn't burn then it will harden and not mix well with the marshmallows.",
