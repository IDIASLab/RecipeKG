Chop up some onions, and saute them in olive oil for a couple of minutes on high heat, throw in minced garlic for another minute. Add some fresh basil for one more minute, and top with shredded or julienned carrot. Stir in your saute with the sauce before adding to the pan of pasta; you'll add more volume, more flavor, and the dish will look even nicer. Plain \"spaghetti sauce\" reminds me of a cafeteria, and should be avoided! (Bonus: throw on a very small portion of grated asiago on the dish in the last ten minutes, and finish off uncovered. The cheese will brown slightly.)",

The sour cream really helps make the cheese mixture creamy instead of grainy like ricotta can be sometimes. I didn't have any Monterey Jack so I just used an Italian cheese blend. I also added garlic per some other suggestions and just snipped a corner off a plastic bag to stuff the shells. Thanks for a great recipe! It will go into the \"rotation.\"",

I used a five cheese italian blend to mix in with the ricotta. I also added in some frozen spinach that I had thawed and drained well into the cheese mixture. Also added in some chopped fresh basil garlic and Tony Chachere's seasoning to the cheese mixture. I omitted the bread crumbs because I didn't see the point in putting them in. I browned a pound of ground beef and added that in to the spaghetti sauce which had been doctored up with extra garlic fresh basil and some italian herbs. I boiled my pasta only 5 minutes as others suggested and then used kitchen shears to cut the manicotti open. It made the filling process so much easier and you couldn't tell after the manicotti was baked! I baked the manicotti about 40 minutes and then sprinkled the top with more of the five-cheese Italian blend. Baked about 10 minutes more to melt the cheese. This came out tasting wonderfully cheesy and delicious!",
