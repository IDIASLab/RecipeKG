If it's half as good firm as it is straight out of the bowl it's sure to be a hit. My husband who hates chicken salad is licking the bowl as I type! I followed the recipe with a couple changes: I used low fat cream cheese and 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup. I also used pickle relish instead of chopped sweet pickle.",

His wife took a copy of the recipe and plans to try it with cream of celery instead of the cream of mushroom soup.) For the record I used leftover chicken we had cooked in our backyard smoker. People commented that the smoky flavor made it extra appealing. I used a tub of whipped cream cheese (easier to stir in than the block type) and also added some fresh oyster mushrooms that I saut\u00e9d in butter. I used sweet relish instead of chopped pickles to save time. Next time I will try using just one packet of gelatin or maybe omit it altogether to make it easier to dip with crackers. I would have chosen a different name for this recipe perhaps \"Creamy Roasted Chicken & Mushroom Dip\" -- I'm glad I tried it despite the original name! Thanks for the great recipe:-)",

That means alot when you're making food for 60-70 people! This will become a staple!!",
