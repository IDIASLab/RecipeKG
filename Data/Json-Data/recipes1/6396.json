I only added half of the bell pepper (my husband has an aversion to \"crunchy\" things:-)) and also added the marinade from the artichokes which kept it from getting too sticky. My only problem is that some of the leaves and hearts are too hard making them inedible. I tried picking them out while chopping but it is hard to tell which ones are OK and which ones aren't. Does anyone have any suggestions to keep this from happening?",
