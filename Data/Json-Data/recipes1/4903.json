Used two cans of condensed cream of chicken WITH HERBS mixed with milk (not wine) for more flavor and one whole box of Stove Top (6 ounce) chicken flavor stuffing.  Had sauteed mushrooms and shallots in the fridge from a previous meal and threw those in as well.  Absolutely wonderful!  Thanks Carolyn for a GREAT recipe.  Definitely a keeper in my rotation!!!",
