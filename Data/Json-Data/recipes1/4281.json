This recipe called for 1 egg along with the almond extract but if you prepare the cake mix by the directions on the box it calls for 3 eggs so I went by the box directions and it turned out really good.  Everyone was amazed that the Baked Alaska didn't melt and was very tasty.  We used orange/pineapple ice cream which was very yummy!  Thanks",

You can also line your bowl with saran wrap. Once the brownie has cooled completely and the ice cream is hard, I put the ice cream on top of the brownie and spread the meringue over the top of the ice cream and to the bottom of the brownie.  Make sure that you have a fairly thick layer of meringue completley covering everything or your ice cream will melt.  I bake this at 375 until lightly brown.  Freeze left overs.  Once frozen it is hard to cut.  ",

I used vanilla bean ice cream, haagen daz chocolate ice cream, and HD rasberry sorbet softened, spreading one layer at a time in a medium tupperware bowl, freezing between layers. I baked 1/2 of Hersheys best choc cake recipe in a round layer cake pan that was the same size across as the tupperware bowl. I spread abt 1/4 c melted raspberry jam on the cooled cake and then put the cake, jam side down, on top of the frozen ice cream layers,smashing it in place with plastic wrap, and put it back in the freezer overnight. I made the meringue as the recipe reads, only I used 10 egg whites, unmolded my ice cream cake into a baking sheet covered with parchment( I covered the bowl for a few minutes with a warm damp towel to loosen) I covered the whole thing with the meringue, then back to the freezer for several hours. Right before serving, I put about 1/2 c of grand marnier in a metal gravy boat, ignited it with my kitchen torch, and poured it , flaming, over the alaska.It was a show stopper! I let it burn until all the alcohol was burned off, and finishd browning the meringue with my torch.. It took 3 days to make, but it was for my husbands birthday, so definitely worth the wait..",

I wanted to make an ice cream pie topped with meringue so I crushed a bunch of Oreos and patted them down into a glass pie plate with some butter and a little sugar. After baking that for a bit I placed it in the freezer to cool and then spooned in some yummy coffee ice cream. That went in the freezer again. Once it was nearly rock solid I whipped up 3 room-temperature egg whites with a handheld mixer on low in a large ceramic (never use plastic) bowl. I added 1/8 tsp cream of tartar and 1/2 cup sugar slowly as it mixed and increased the speed in increments. I grabbed the pie out of the freezer and spread the meringue on top making sure to meet all the edges. The peaks weren't extremely stiff but they held up when I swirled them around. I baked my concoction for about 6 minutes in the oven but unfortunately the ice cream melted quite a bit. Perhaps the cake serves as a buffer. Anyway I froze it all over again and it turned out lovely without weeping at all.",
