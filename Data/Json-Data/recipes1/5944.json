I think adding sliced black olives with cheddar and broiling it to melt over the olives gets a lot more of the Schlotskys bread flavor since that's what they do.  It was very good though and satisfied my craving since we don't have one near us anymore.  Anyway great recipe!",

The first night we had Schlotzsky original sandwiches by melting cheddar cheese on one half and mozzarella and parmesan cheese on the other side under the broiler. Then added chopped kalamata olives warmed ham genoa salami and turkey with a garlic dressing and a little mayo and shredded lettuce. I didn t have any tomatoes or onions but that would have made it perfect. Two days later we built mini pizzas out of the bread halves. Very yummy I will make this bread often.

I prefer ciabatta bread by Marina from this site for a similar bread (I don't use a bread machine and don't mist for a soft crust). Eons ago I worked at Schlotzsky's and had first shift cutting the buns meat veggies. Horizontal is correct. As just previously suggested individual springform pans make great molds for (large) single serving. A cake pan is the correct form for a large. (several of these make an impressive presentation for a party/gathering) Cut to serve as you would a pie small or large slices. To make a GREAT sammy try this...Slice bread horizontally and give it a healthy drizzle with infused olive oil then add a good healthy sprinkle of grated sharp provolone (BelGioioso is good). This is like a romano or parm cz. Broil (or toast in toaster oven)then add thinly sliced smoked turkey shredded lettuce and thinly sliced tomatoes and red onion. Yum.",
