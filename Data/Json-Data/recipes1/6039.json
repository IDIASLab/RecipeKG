I think next time I will try the horseradish just to see if I like the flavor in the salad because I love horseradish. End result was basic but still very good can't wait for lunch today because it has been chilling all night. I always believe salads like this are better the next day as the flavors have a chance to come together and the pasta has had a chance to chill. OH!!!

First, I doubled the recipe, and used small shells instead of the elbows. Used dried onion flakes instead of the fresh. Left out the green pepper because my husband doesn't care for it. Used dill pickle juice instead of the vinegar.  Used dried parsley instead of the fresh, and substituted Old Bay for the chili powder as others have suggested.  Used canned medium deveined shrimp (2 four ounce cans because the recipe was doubled).  Even with all those changes, it still had amazing flavor.  The sauce was very liquid when first made, but it all absorbed after the 3 hours in the fridge, and was the perfect consistency.  Day #2 it's even better, and doesn't need more mayo.  I can see where this would be terrific using chicken or ham instead of the shrimp.  This is one of my favorite recipes on Allrecipes. Thanks again!",
