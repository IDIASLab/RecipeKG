It is an oily batter and I think the cooking time needs to be increased by 2-3 min. or else you get a very wet moist cookie that collapses when you pick it up. I use large walnut size dough balls and bake it for about 13 min. Even with this cooking time the cookies still comes out super moist and stays pretty moist for a few days. I think the recipe could take less oil - 1/4 - 1/3 cup should be enough. Overall very fudgy and moist and the only cake-mix recipe that actually taste homemade. I will make this recipe again.",

They're chewey and definitely \"moist.\" I'm just not sure if they're \"fudgey\" or \"greasy.\" The taste is okay especially since I added 1 tsp. of chocolate extract but I find the oily dough off-putting to begin with and the finished cookie is just a little more \"moist\" than I would like. Maybe cut back a little on the oil to say even 1/3 cup?",
