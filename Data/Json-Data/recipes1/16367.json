For a veggie version; omit potatoes but add 1 c. chpd zucchini, 1/2 c. each yellow onion & red & yellow bell pepper chpd.  Top evenly with 1/3 c. crumbled goat cheese & freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano chs; 1/4 c. fresh flat leaf parsley & 1/4 c. fresh basil, sliced.  Add 1 or 2 more egges plus add 1 c. heavy cream.  Bake in 9x13 dish ahead of time at 400* oven for 25-30 min. or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.  Serve immediately OR cover with foil & chill until the next day (I have also frozen this frittata for up to one month).  Re-warm in a 250* for 20-30 min.  Fresh goat cheese is better than the pre-crumbled kind but it works too.",

Then back to the pan and cook a bit more, loosen the edges and one more time under the broiler until it's slightly browned.  I also used some good loose breakfast sausage from the butcher instead of pre packaged brand name sausage.  VERY good recipe.  Thanks for posting it!",
