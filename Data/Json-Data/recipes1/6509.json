Made it for a date with a picky vegetarian and she had seconds and asked to take some leftovers.\n\nA couple of notes - used a 9.5in. pie plate and needed 1.5 packs of crescent rolls to cover it.\n\nSauted in olive oil instead of butter.\n\nAdded a hand full more spinach while sauteing as it reduced considerably.\n\nHad to bake it for 45 minutes, covered edges of crust with tinfoil after 30 to keep from burning.  Turned out perfectly browned and set in the middle.\n\nPut a thin layer of the cheese in the bottom over the crust before pouring in the filling.\n\nUsed about 1/3 of a 1.5oz pack of Knorr garlic and herb seasoning.  Could maybe use a little less.\n\nLet it cool at least 10 minutes before serving.  Very hot in the middle.",

Hubby finished the leftovers all by himself!:-) Like several others I used the Lipton Savory Herb soup mix but I only used 2-3 teaspoons of the packet based on others' notes that the entire packet could be too much. This was perfect for our taste. I used baby Portobello mushrooms...quite good. Had to play with the crescent rolls a bit(like others) to get the crust laid out properly and in retrospect would have used the small can (not the \"Grands\" version) of the crescent rolls--I had quite a bit of excess dough. Our particular dish needed to cook almost 50 minutes to set properly in the middle but it turned out quite well. Reheats well too. Thanks Mindy!",
