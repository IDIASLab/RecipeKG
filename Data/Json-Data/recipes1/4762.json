First of all, i cook it in the oven without the biscuits for 10 minutes, then add them on top and put it back in for 15. I also add a brick of cream cheese to the soup mixture for some extra taste. and if i really want to be adventureous i mix in corn and i top with grated cheese {cheese goes on before the biscuits.} these are just a few fast easy things that i find improve this meal. thanks for it, i love it",
