I find that adding a touch more garlic and a bit more honey helps liven up the flavor and washes out the \"ketchupy\" taste. I also find that to pack more flavor into the chicken one should let the chicken marinate in the sauce overnight rather than baking it immediately. Very tasty. My husband loves it.",

Substituted agave nectar for some of the honey. Used an all natural ketchup to skip the high fructose corn syrup. Agree with other reviewers in that I will skip the searing next time; seemed like a waste of olive oil and a pan; sauce was plenty flavorful without the oil. That step can be equaled by browning it uncovered in the oven at the end of cooking. Very easy with ingredients nearly every kitchen already has.",

Made a marinade of honey balsamic little soy and whatever BBQ sauce I had on hand. Let marinade for 2 days in the fridge. One day should work. I was just busy and couldn't cook it right away. Covered in foil baked for an hour and took foil off for about 15 minutes to make crispy. Worked great. I am trying to learn how to take and cook the skin off of chicken and the this recipe worked. The chicken was still most and tender. I had chicken leg and breast cut and skinned turned out great. I think the flavor comes from seasoning the chicken once the skin is off. I let the seasonings sit before I put it in the marinade. Poultry garlic/parsley onion pepper garam masala basil. Totally good.",
