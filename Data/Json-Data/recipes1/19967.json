The only thing I knew about their recipe was that they used bell peppers instead of pimentos. I figured the rest out on my own. My family devours it every time I make it. Serve this with crackers, or spread it on bread for a tasty sandwich.",

I almost didn't make it because of that. Reading the reviews & ease of recipe I decided to try it. So glad I did. Of course brand's are different every where but here are the ones I found & used from my local grocery store. OK. I made it exactly as written but like others added 1 tsp. minced refrigerated garlic from the jar. Also just to make incorporation easier & even I put the 3/4 cup (reg. Hellmans) in a meas. cup added the 1/2 cup diced roasted red peppers (Mezzetta) on top & stirred in the worcestershire & minced garlic. I used Sargentino's fancy shredded sharp cheddar since my food processer isn't working and just used a hand beater to meld the mixture into dip texture. So quick & good. Thanks for the recipe!!",
