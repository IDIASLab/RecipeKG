It was OK - nothing extra special really. Although it is simple and I normally would have all ingredients on hand. I used a mix of cheddar & Jack cheeses cause I usually have those on hand as well. For a party where there's a million dishes I could see 16 servings but for a really good like movie snack or something maybe only half that. This definitely needs eaten warm - had to nuke it a couple of times. There was some left over after the chips were gone so I added some refried beans and made a quesadilla out of it.",
