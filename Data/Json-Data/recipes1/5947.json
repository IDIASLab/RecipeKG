I used one large can of Roma tomatoes instead of the fresh ones and in place of the broth I used...wait for it...3/4 bottle of a dry but light white wine...chardonnay or sauterne will do nicely! I also added sea scallops a few minutes prior to serving...with just enough time to cook them without making them tough. My boyfriend can't eat mussels so I steamed the mussels in the remaining wine and added them after the fact. I also added a small lobster tail for each guest to the delight of everyone! Serve this with a first course of squid ink pasta with lemon butter and salmon caviar a green salad with homemade vinaigrette and French bread and let the compliments begin!",
