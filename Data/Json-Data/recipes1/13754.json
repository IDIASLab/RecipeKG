My husband loves meals with lots of meat, so I browned 1 pound of ground beef with some fresh cracked black pepper and some chili flakes, drained that and added it to the spaghetti sauce with some of the mozzerella cheese and some pepperoni. I was worried that the spaghetti noodles were going to burn during the first baking, but the noodles were great too. I will make this dish again and I would definately recommend to others!

I was worried that a 9X13 pan would be too big, but the pasta was just enough on the bottom to form a thin crust....a smaller pan would have made for too much pasta.  A whole jar of sauce scared me a tad, but once again, it was enough, possibly could have used a bit more.  Overall, this was a super easy and yummy recipe.  I might even let me kids help me next time.  Thanks!",

I added about 1/4 tsp. pepper, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp garlic powder... in addition to the existing spices.  stirred that all up in the spaghetti sauce, same i would if i were making pizza sauce.  i did not sprinkle it on top separate like the recipe suggests.  i also fried up a frozen pizza burger patty and some onion (maybe 1/4 cup, didn't really measure), crumbled it, and stirred it into the sauce too.  i know pizza burgers aren't available in every part of the country, but they are popular in the upper midwest.  added sliced olives and mushrooms to the top along with the pepperoni... delicious.  savory enough for adult taste buds and probably tame/tasty enough for a child too.  also, i was cooking several things at once so i didn't put the crust back in the oven right away.  it was cooled down a lot before i put it back in w/the toppings on.  i think that really helped it to set well.  someone mentioned the spaghetti part getting too hard.  i added a couple small pats of butter to it, after i'd strained it and sprayed the baking dish well.  that did the trick fine.  remained quite moist.  five stars all around.  in my regular rotation now.",
