My oreos stuck together even after refrigeration for 15 min as instructed at bottom of recipe. Spreading the filling \"dirtied\" the cream. My semisweet chips cooled as I was working with them and reheating in microwave did not work for me. I melted a chocolate bar 90% cocoa and this stayed nice and silky. I tried brushing chocolate on Oreo but my brush hardened so I used a baby feeding spoon. I put a few in freezer as I worked on others then assembled. Great idea time consuming...would appreciate some hints...probably my ineptness:-)",

I used double stuff Oreos and the thickness of the filling helped hold the feathers up. I also used melted chocolate between the tail portion and the malted milk ball to help support the heavy tails.

Instead of dealing with messy melted chocolate I thought I would try white cupcake icing in the can. It works wonderfully keeps the candy on and matches the Oreo cream. I did the tails first and put them in the fridge for a few minutes while I worked on the body then it was easy to put the tails on after the icing hardened. My son liked to mix n match the feet and used Reese's pieces or cut up Candy corn. These turkeys are so easy and fast and everybody loves them!",
