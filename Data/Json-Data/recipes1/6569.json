Also, I had Dijon mustard on hard-use it if you have it! The result was a beautifully creamy-and sufficiently sweet for my taste-dressing. I used it on a pasta vegetable salad and added it to My Recipe Box for future use. I wanted to share the sugar substitute idea for those of you who might be put off by the white sugar ingredient. Oh, I taste-tested too, which is why I knew immediately that this recipe is a keeper.",
