I blanched the green beans for ONLY 2 minutes as I love a crisp bite to my beans and you will be putting them in the oven at 400 again so they get cooked again there. They came out PERFECT ! A very nice SNAP left in the bean when it came out of the oven and it they even sat for 1/2hr before we ate and STILL had that CRUNCH! Added a bit more Blue cheese because I put a layer of the bean mixture in the dish then layered some of the cheese on then added all the rest of the bean mixture that way when you got to the middle of the beans there would still be blue cheese. Did everything else all the same. Got complements and there were none left in my dish!! Need I say more!!",
