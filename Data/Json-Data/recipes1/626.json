After adding the extra egg they were much easier to dip/roll in the cinnamon sugar. Also I couldn't find ground anise for the life of me so I had to use a scant tsp of anise extract instead. They almost reminded me of shortbread cookies with a touch of anise flavor in the background.",

Almost as good as my friend Esther's whose recipe I was trying to duplicate only her directions were a can of pre-creamed shortening a 5 lb bag of flour 2 c sugar boil cinn stick and anise to make a tea add that to dry...etc. LOL I mentioned to her I just didn't need 1000 cookies! so I found this very similar recipe. I think she called these Biscochito. (I think that's how it's spelled) Our local grocery makes them and calls them \"pan de polvo\" also called \"Mexican wedding cookies\". Wonderful texture and flavor to these little cookies. They almost melt in your mouth. This made about 8 dozen tea sized cookies. Can't eat just one...Thanks for sharing this keeper!",
