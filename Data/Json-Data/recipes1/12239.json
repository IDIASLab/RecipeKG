I used an electric juicer and it really speeded up the process and also gave me about 1.5 cups of lemon juice (I still used 1 cup for the recipe). Before I added the sugar I melted it with a little bit of water in a pot to form a syrup so it wouldn't be so gritty in the lemonade. It worked. A fantastic recipe!",
