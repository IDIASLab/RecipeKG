Made in a 9x13 pan and baked in my oven for 45 minutes.  I made a 'review' mini muffin and this is outstanding.  Light and airy but yet rich tasting w/the butter substitution.  Made 'WHIPPED CREAM CREAM CHEESE FROSTING' recipe from this site (by Tom) and if you have never tried this frosting, it is a must.  It is so addictive and is the perfect compliment to this cake, as the frosting is very light and whippy and not sickening sweet.  Made a day ahead for a treat to the co-workers tomorrow.  Thanks for this lovely and easy recipe.",

I followed the basic directions except subbed real butter for the shortening and cut back on the white sugar slightly. After reading reviewers problems with sticking I decided to try muffins. I got 12 nice sized muffins (used liners) cooked in 18 minutes. This does have a light banana flavor. I used the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting recipe by Tom (which was fantastic). I will continue to try banana cake recipes from this site that are actually fluffy and taste like cake.",

This cake is fluffy as it claims and has a really delicious crust. I also used butter instead of shortening and will do the same next time. Used 1/2 cup buttermilk (homemade - scant 1/2 cup with 1/2 tablespoon of vinegar let it sit for 5 minutes) by mistake and it was still great. These days I make into mini muffins for my toddlers who can't get enough of them then freeze them to have in the freezer for breakfast every weekend (microwave 12 seconds upside down then flip right side up for another 12 seconds). This make about 30 mini muffins and only need 12-13 minutes to bake. I have to make another batch before the freezer stash runs out or there will be hell to pay!!!!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great cake - I couldn't be more pleased. BUT...I did't make it exactly to specifications. I used butter rather than shortening tho' because I'm familiar with cakes made with both I know I would not have been disappointed had I prepared the cake with shortening. I used one more banana and just a tad more buttermilk than called for. I wanted banana cake not banana bread so I figured these two adjustments would help achieve that. I mixed this up a little differently than the recipe instructs. I creamed the butter and sugar VERY well then added the eggs and vanilla beating well after each. Then I blended in the mashed bananas. I added the dry ingredients alternately in thirds with the buttermilk beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Most important in my mind was that I used 8\" rather than 9\" layer cake pans which turned out a perfectly sized cake - baked about 30 minutes. I'm not sure I would have been as happy with the \"shorter\" cake that would have resulted from the 9\" pans. I chose to frost it with a chocolate buttercream frosting and garnished it with crushed Milano cookies. I had no issues with it being a dense cake at all and was quite happy with it's light moist crumb. The ripeness of the bananas I used was reflected in how pleasantly flavorful and sweet the cake was. This is just a good old-fashioned banana layer cake I wouldn't hesitate to make again.",

I used 3 bananas (1 1/4 c mashed) and decreased sugar to 1 c as well as using unsalted butter in lieu of shortening (I always use real butter for baking!). They were very good and were fluffy - I wanted something that wasn't going to feel heavy like banana bread and this was it. Even with the sugar decrease they were still nicely sweet especially if planning to ice them. I also used very ripe bananas so maybe they added their own extra sweetness? Lastly this is enough batter for 12 nice full-sized cupcakes or 18 cupcakes that are a little on the small side but since they rise so well it's not bad.",
