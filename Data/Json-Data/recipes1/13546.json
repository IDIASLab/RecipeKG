Two tablespoons of liquid did not seem nearly enough to cook something in the crockpot.  I used 1/3 cup of both syrup (I also had the lite kind) and soy sauce  I added a big squirt of honey and a few shakes of worcestershire sauce as well.  I used 1 teaspoon of each of the spices, used onion powder and fresh garlic as that is what I had on hand.  I was late starting this (about 1 pm) so I turned the crockpot on high.  It's a good thing I was home because it only took about 3 1/2 hours to cook.  I think 9 hours (even on low) would have been way too long, but I did use boneless country style ribs.  Overall a delicious recipe and I will make it again!",

Place a 2 or 3 layers of paper towels over your slow cooker, then put the lid on. The paper towels will capture the moisture. I use this trick every time I make something that I don't want the sauce to get thin. Hope this helps! Many blessings to all!",

I use boneless ribs, which make less liquid in the slow cooker. I also double the maple syrup, since I use the sugar free type. I find that if I do it this way, when the time is up, I can pull the lid off of the slow cooker and the meat pulls apart beautifully. Also, if I want to switch it up a bit, adding a bottle of my favorite barbecue suace tastes great too. My fiancee loves this recipe and requests it often.",

The sauce turned out very thin more like a marinade or broth than a clinging or spreadable sauce; but that was expected and the ribs were very tender and flavorful just from being cooked in it. My husband who had never eaten ribs that weren t slathered in BBQ sauce before enjoyed these and I will be making this recipe again. What a perfect combination; the convenience of the slow cooker for me and a main dish that my family likes. Thanks.",

I scaled the recipe to 6 servings and was worried that there would not be enough liquid to cook the ribs in. The fat in the ribs rendered down and the ribs ended up all but covered in liquid. I cooked on low for about 6 hours and the ribs were falling apart when we went to eat. My family enjoyed it a nice change from BBQ ribs. I don't understand the reviewers who added BBQ sauce. Why not just use a BBQ recipe to begin with? I thought there was lots of flavor in this recipe. For a better/stronger maple taste I would suggest using REAL maple syrup. I will use this recipe again for sure!!",
