The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think you need to pound the chicken breasts before grilling them. The sandwiches were HUGE and were really hard to eat, as is. Also, I would recommend pureeing the avocado and using it as a spread with the mayo. I will definitely use this recipe again and Thank you!",

I've made it as called for many times but when I'm in a hurry (for two ppl) I coat the one piece of chicken in olive oil then liberally sprinkle course kosher salt and pepper on each side. Then I lightly sprinkle garlic powder and onion powder on (skipping the carmelized onions) and sautee until done. Warning this can get a little smokey. I let the chicken cool for about 5 minutes and cut the chicken in half lengthwise. I put cheese on each piece and microwave briefly (no more than 30 seconds you don't want to dry the chicken out). Cover lightly with foil to let the steam melt the cheese the rest of the way. For the spread I mash the avocado and lemon juice with a little less than a teaspoon of garlic salt and leave out the mayo. Spread the avo-mix on four slices of bread/bun and microwave for 10 seconds to warm the spread and soften the bread. Assemble each sandwich with one half of the chicken then spinach (or arugula or lettuce) and top with some thin slices of tomato if desired. I've made this a lot and it's a keeper! So good I highly recommend this recipe.",
