It was a surprise because I really didn't think it sounded too good when I read the recipe. I only made it because I had bread eggs cream cheese & broccoli on hand that were about to expire & I wanted to use them before I had to toss them. That's usually not the best reason to choose a recipe right? But this turned out great in my opinion. I did make some substitutions: used left over stater tots instead of potatoes added some left over ham to the bacon since i didn't have 12 strips used whole wheat sandwich bread instead of French and used a softened block of cream cheese not the tub. Recipe was still tasty but I imagine it would be even better as written. I was surprised how much I liked the broccoli in this type of casserole. It added a nice crunch. And I was also surprised that all of the ingredients would fit into the baking dish. It seemed like there would be too much but it worked & was probably why the casserole was filled with yummy goodness in each bite. I also threw in some Mrs. Dash mustard & Worcestershire just for a little more flavor in the eggs. Delicious and was a great way to use things that I typically have in the fridge. We had it for dinner but it would be great for any meal.",
