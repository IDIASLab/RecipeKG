I make mine slightly different: Cook pasta drain the water and rinse. Melt a little bit of butter in a pan with minced garlic (this way the garlic won't have a raw taste to it) until butter starts making small bubbles. Mix plain yogurt (doesn't have to be warmed up) with pasta (making sure pasta isin't too hot or the yogurt will seperate). Add the butter to the pasta and toss. We love ours with a little bit of paprika and cayenne for a little kick. You can't go wrong with this recipe.",

Toss the hot pasta with the melted butter and coat well (be generous). Then add the mix of yogurt garlic paste (which includes the salt) and crushed dry mint (per your taste). It has to be dry to add super flavour!! The yogurt is fine cold it will warm up with the hot pasta... enjoy!!!",

Next time I will probably reduce the amount of yogurt because it was just a bit too creamy for me and add sauteed onions. I also threw in some peas and chicken to make it a meal.
