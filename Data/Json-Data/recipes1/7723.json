I followed the recipe but rectified some of these problems with 1 1/2t salt 1/2t pepper 2T more of sweet pickle relish 1t more of mustard 3T more of miracle whip and 6 more eggs. We like our potato salad pretty eggy and mustardy. Thanks David.",

I added a bit more sweet relish than the recipe stated just because I like it. I also added just a touch more mustard (again just a personal preference). It was fantastic! Everyone loved it and my husband said it's the best potato salad he's ever had. I agree! Thanks for a great recipe that I'm going to be using a LOT!",

I think my potatoes were monster vs large so the wet mixture didn't go very far. I used 5 eggs vs 3. I just kept adding more miracle whip and more mustard. Plus I had to add salt since all of my testers said it needed some. I chose to leave the potatoes cubed vs mashed but I think I could have cooked my russets about 12 minutes vs the 15 minutes. After fiddling here and there my final addition was some vigorous splashes of red wine vinegar to give it a little extra kick. The final product was just how I like it.",
