The only thing I added was 1/2 t. salt because I used unsalted butter.  The cake flour gives it a fine, soft crumb, so be sure to use it.",

You must try this cake now it's so great! And it's fun to make too with an electric mixer it barely takes any time and it looks beautiful when finished and came out of the pans perfectly too. & 1 more thing you only have to bake it for 25 min. so it's quite quick. yum!",

But it was a little short on flavor. More vanilla or some other additional flavoring might help, and a little salt definitely would have. This made much too big a cake for just Hubs and me so I experimented and baked 1/3 of the recipe (scaled it to 12 servings) in an 8-inch square pan. It didn't take long to bake - 18-20 minutes maybe. When cooled I just cut it in half, and used each half as a layer. It made a cute little loaf shaped layer cake for the two of us!",

Next time I might add an additional egg yolk just for a deeper yellow color. I used two 8-inch cake pans so I needed to increase the baking time since I had more batter per pan. I started testing the cakes at 25 minutes and they took about 35-40 minutes. The cake wasn't too dry for me but next time I may use a soaking syrup for just a little added moistness.",
