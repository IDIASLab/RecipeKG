By trying to cook the pasta in all of the ingredients, I had a gooey albeit tasty mess at the end.  Save yourself the trouble: cook pasta and sauce separately and you will have an easy, tasty meal.",

I used a red onion as that was all I had on hand.  I added a couple dashes of Worchestshire to give it more of a beefy flavor.  Also added a dash of ground pepper and used whole wheat macaroni which I cooked seperately per package directions as there wasn't much cooking liquid in the goulash.  I topped it off with some grated Romano cheese.  Delicious!",
