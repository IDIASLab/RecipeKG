I doubled it and we still didn't have a lot leftover for sandwiches. He piled his plate high! I made mashed potatoes and green peas to go with it. Tip for cutting the grease: put several pieces of sandwich bread underneath the meatloaf. It will soak up a lot of the grease, then just throw the nasty greasy bread away when the loaf is done! Thank you Rempels for sharing your recipe!!!!",

As I was out of ketchup, I subbed chili glaze (small round bottle) which gave the the meatloaf an additional kick, and used the glaze noted in \"Connie's Jan 2009\" review.  Very tasty!!!!  Reviewers Please Note:  If you can find cheese crackers such as Carr's cheese melts (gourmet crackers), they truly make this recipe go from wonderful to over the top!  Thanks Connie for a great submission!",

It reminded me of something the old ladies bring to church for a potluck.  It was fine, but I think I'll stick to my own recipe.  \n*edit* I had to give this another try since everyone else loves it so much.  So this time I made it for my parents and reduced the eggs to 2, the ketchup to 2 T. and added  an extra tablespoon of steak sauce. I also added the glaze of ketchup, honey, and worchestershire suggested by another reviewer. It turned out much better and everyone really liked it this time. I've also made it with the bread in the bottom and without.  This recipe is incredibly greasy, but the meatloaf sticks to the bread, leaving you with a soggy bread residue on the bottom.  It's way better to just leave out the bread and drain out the grease, because even with the bread, you still have to drain it.  ",
