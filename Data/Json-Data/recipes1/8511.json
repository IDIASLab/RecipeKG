The only thing I can say is that I think there may have been a typo on the baking time. I baked this for an hour instead of thirty minutes and it came out great. Due to the oil content of the cake the toothpick came out clean even though it was not all the way done. Also I remember when my grandma made this she poked holes in the cake for the topping to seep into the cake which I think makes it all the more better.",
