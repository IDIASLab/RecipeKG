I put the chicken and the sauce in a plastic bag and left it in the fridge all day and baked it that evening.  I did baste it and that kept it very moist.  I would recommend using chicken with skin on (even though I usually don't bake with the skin on) because the pieces with skin on seemed moister than the pieces without.  I didn't have any hot sauce and it was still great.  So were the leftovers.  Oh, and I took the cover off the last 15 or 20 minutes and it was an appetizing golden brown color.  Excellent.",

Even two chicken breasts for Hubs and me filled the air with that mouth-watering smell.  I used bone-in, skin-on breasts as the submitter recommends.  There is just no comparison between them and boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  You get SO much more flavor with bone-in breasts!  As one reviewer suggested, don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have the exact herbs called for \u2013 substituting, mixing or matching will all result in a darned fine piece of chicken; tender, moist and flavorful.  A \u201cSunday Dinner\u201d type of chicken for sure!  I knew that covering the chicken would not produce the deep golden brown skin I wanted so I sprinkled it with paprika before it went into the oven and uncovered it during the last fifteen minutes of roasting.  They were, indeed, the color I was after with a nicely crisped skin. Chicken breasts vary greatly in size, so use the cooking time suggested as only a guide.  A meat thermometer should register 160-165 degrees and the juices should run clear, not pink.  This is some of the best chicken I\u2019ve had in some time and this recipe reaffirms that bone-in, skin-on breasts are superior to boneless.  I served these with Lemon Parsley Potatoes and Green Beans with Cherry Tomatoes.",

I took five or six boneless chicken breasts, salted & peppered them, then placed them in a pyrex baking dish.  I just sprinkled herbs over the chicken, (dried thyme, basil, a little sage & rosemary, etc.) plus fresh garlic and about a half a cup of white wine (NOT cooking wine).  Chicken was EXCELLENT--you really can't go wrong when you flavor the chicken with herbs!  As other reviewers have noted, this is a great one to play around with.  The wine and herbs smelled divine while cooking.  Fail-safe, wonderful chicken!!",
