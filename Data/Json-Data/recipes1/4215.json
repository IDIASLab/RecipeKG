If you're making by hand, mix all ingredients (proof the yeast in 1/4 cup of the water and a teaspoon of sugar), turn onto a floured surface, and knead 8-10 mins. Put into a lightly oiled bowl, turn once to coat, cover, and place in a slightly warm oven for about 25 mins. Punch down, cut/shape, then place on baking pan and cover to let rise at room temp while you preheat the oven.  Score just before placing in a 375 degree oven for about 30 mins. Mine came out plain, but I blame that on my young starter.  Fantastic!  EDIT:  The second time I made this, I wanted good dinner rolls, so I used a cup of a half-water, half-flour mixture in place of sourdough starter, and it made FABULOUS plain white dinner rolls.",

However, every starter is different and you need a bit of breadmaking experience to judge whether your starter is too acidic/sour(then it needs either flour feeding and/or soda to neutralize) or whether it is frothy or too flat (then it needs added yeast to help out) and check to see if your dough is smooth just before rising or needs a few drops more water or a few shakes more water to make a stiff dough.",

                "reviewBody": "this IS plain and simple. I don't have a bread machine and the rule of thumb I was told for sourdough is 1.5 cups of starter per loaf when not using yeast. To me the beauty of using starter is *not* needing the yeast. Also, with starter/no yeast you get a much slower fermentation and thus a better \"sourdough\" flavor to the bread. That said, I understand that this recipie is intended for a bread machine which pretty much makes the added yeast necessary. To make it \"non machine\" oriented I just eliminated the yeast, and used 1.5c starter and 1/4 c. of water to make up the same liquid content. There is only 1 recipie I found here on AR that uses no bread machine and no added yeast like I was looking for. I tried it and didn't like it...so started playing with other ones for the bread machines. I like this one the best with the changes in the starter above. This one has a good bite to it like sourdough should. The others I tried came out too sweet like plain old white bread.*made this a few more times and  tweaked it. Knead about 50 times since the bread dough machine \"does it for you\". Normally bread bakes in about 30 minutes. The last time I didn't hear the timer go off and it baked a lot longer. It came out NICE and crusty that way...family declared it just perfect!",

I use the dough cycle on my bread machine and when finished, I dump it on a non stick silicone baking sheet, punch out the air bubbles and form it into 80 gram balls. I slice a cross on the top, brush with water and sprinkle on some sea salt and place in my bread warmer for an hour. Pop them into the oven at 375 for 10 minutes, cool for as long as your tempted to rip 'em open, slather with butter and devour. For a nice brown color after you've baked them for 10 minutes, I open the oven door and broil them them just a little for about 1 minute. Don't walk away, just keep a close eye on it.  This is my one indulgence as I don't normally eat carbs. I take my starter out of the fridge, feed it, and wait two- three days before making bread. It gives it that nice sourdough flavor if I wait longer. My sourdough starter is: 1 pkg dry yeast in 1/2 C warm water, 2 C King Arthur unbleached white bread flour, 2 C warm water and 1 TB sugar. I feed once a week with: 1 C hot water, 1/4 c potato flakes, 1/2 C sugar, 1 C white bread flour. You really can't go wrong with this recipe. To die for!!!",
