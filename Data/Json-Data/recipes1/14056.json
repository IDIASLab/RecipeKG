I left out one can of chilis and used Sara's Red Enchilada Sauce from this site in place of tomato sauce. Heat the tortillas in a non-stick pan for a half minute or so this will make them pliable without the oil or sauce on them. I also served the sour cream on the side for garnish rather than in with the sauce. Thanks Sara.",
