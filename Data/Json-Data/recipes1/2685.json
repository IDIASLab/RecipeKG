Here is another tip to make it even more special:\nInstead of dividing the dough into 3 parts for braiding, form it into a one big strip and roll it out into a big rectangle. Then spread soft butter evenly on the dough and sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on top of the butter. I like to use all three generously ;) After this, roll the dough rectrangle into one long roll. You can make some cuts on the loaf if you want (every 2\" for example), this is not necessary but the bread looks nice this way. Brush each loaf with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar.",

They said it tasted the same as the ones they buy at the Finnish bakery!  It was very easy to make. Per my husband's request, I added about a cup of raisins to the batter (I would definitely recommend this, and sprinkled slivered almonds on the top of the egg wash/sugar (before baking) on two of them.  On the third I made a glaze of confectioner's sugar, milk and vanilla extract (which I, personally, liked better).  I also baked the three loaves in a convection oven at 375 for about 30 minutes and just kept checking them... I think 400 would have been too high.  One more thing, i baked them on my pampered chef stones which are known for not allowing things to burn so the bottoms stayed nice and soft.  This bread, though it takes a long time to make, is relatively easy and tastes as wonderful as it looks!  According to my in-laws, it freezes well too (I didn't have any left because they took the remaining two loaves home!)  Thanks for the great recipe!",

I had never had, or even heard of, cardamom before and now I am in love! : )  After reading the reviews of what other people had to say, I gave making this bread a shot. It took forever to make (I am just learning to make bread with yeast from scratch by hand), about 6 hours for me!  After all of the work, I think it was more than worth it.  I added raisins; I took about 1.5 cups of raisins, added enough water to cover them and simmered them on medium until most of the water was gone.  Then I let them drain on a paper towel (all this to keep the bread from getting dry.  I have done this to all of my quick breads that call for dried fruit and it works like a charm).  I added them last.  I made a chocolate sauce and a cream cheese glaze to go over a couple of the loaves.  My favorite way is served cold with butter and a glass of orange juice.  : ) Tip: I used parchment paper to keep the bottoms from sticking and burning.  Also, I took others advice and baked at 350 F for 20-30 minutes.  It turned out PERFECT!  I can't thank you enough,Kim B.!",
