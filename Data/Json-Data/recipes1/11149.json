It's only different in the way that the marshmallows are not added to the batter.  I suppose it has morphed like tons of other recipes...but adding the marshmallows to the batter makes it a lot more gooey (although it is called \"mud\" pie).  For this recipe, in my opinion, it works better if you put the marshmallows on top after it's baked and cook it for 2 more minutes until the marshmallows melt.  Then let it cool and frost with chocolate frosting and sprinkle with nuts when the frosting is soft. ",
