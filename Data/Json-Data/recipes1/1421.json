Also fluid ounces confuse me (are they the same as ounces?) so I used 1/2 cup galliano and 2 tablespoons of vodka in the cake. In the glaze I did 1 tablespoon of oj 1 of galliano and 1 teaspoon of vodka. When you're baking you already have the teaspoons out so it's much easier. Also I do recommend adding the vodka because it gave something to the cake. You know how sometimes you sip a really good cocktail and the alcohol warms you? That's what happened when I took a bite. Wonderful. I highly recommend the cake with the changes I made. Also for those who would like to try to make the drink a bartender told me-take a juice glass (tall or short) and fill with ice. Add a shot of vodka half a shot of galliano and fill to top with orange juice. Stir. You'll find it tastes just like the cake!",

WOW there are not words to express how absolutely delish this cake is. I also made it as a \"Lemon Poppyseed\" cake; use Lemon Supreme cake mix instant lemon pudding and 1/2 C lemon juice and 1/2 cup water in place of the alcohol. Mix in a few table spoons of poppyseeds and make the glaze out of lemon juice grated lemon peel and confectioners sugar. This cake ROCKS like you can't imagine. A real crowd pleaser. And as one other reviewer suggested bake on 325 degrees for about 55 minutes and it turns out lighter and fluffier.",
