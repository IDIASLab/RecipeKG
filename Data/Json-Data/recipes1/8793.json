After trying a few really bland recipe's I wanted some FLAVOR.. soooo Instead of cream of wheat I used Italian bread crumbs. I also added 1/2 tsp allspice 1 TSP worceschire sauce 1 tsp garlic powder and one package Lipton Onion Soup Mix to the meat... (I used 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground pork). I think Marla really hit it on the head with frying the meatballs instead of baking them initially. This really added a lot of flavor. I then used Jessica's sauce (1 can evaporated milk 1 can cream of chicken soup one can cream of mushroom soup and my own addition of 1/4 cup white wine. I have had authentic swedish meatballs in Sweden and these were much better!!! Thanks Marla",

For the sauce I use the drippings 1 can evaporated milk 1 can cr. mushroom soup and 1/4 cup sour cream mixed together and poured over meatballs. Then bake them for about 2 hrs. on 300 or until sauce is the way you like it. We like the extra sauce to serve over mashed potatoes or noodles. I go really easy on the nutmeg. A little dill weed also is good if you like that flavor. This came from a Swede from the old country. The only difference is she used heavy cream and sour cream thickened with a little flour to pour over. A very good recipe we serve every Christmas as well as throughout the year.",
