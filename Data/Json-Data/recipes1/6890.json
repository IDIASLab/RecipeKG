This turns out slightly crispy slightly sweet and tastes wonderfully toasty. In addition it is not at all crumbly. The trick is as the recipe says to cook over \"medium\" heat until toasty or golden \"brown.\" Be mindful to stir often as once it begins to brown it will burn quickly. I only wish I could give it 10 stars for originality taste and ease of preparation.",
