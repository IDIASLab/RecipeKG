I added basil and oregano and fresh parsely too. It all turned out really tasty but I think it would have been bland without my additions. Thanks!",

I sauteed the garlic with 1/4 of a large onion at the start then added my other vegetables as per the recipe. Because I was going for a complete meal on a bowl I added 2 skinless poached chicken breast halves. I poached in water flavoured with some red wine and 2 stock cubes. After chopping the chicken into bite size pieces I added it half way through the simmering period. Delicious with soy and linseed bread.",
