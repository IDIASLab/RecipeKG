I chopped up about a 1/4 lb. of pancetta, fried it, removed it from the pan, drained off all but about 2 tbls of the fat and browned the shanks. I removed the shanks and used the same fat to saute the onions, added the wine and deglazed the pan. I added the previously fried pancetta with the other ingredients. I know it's not as healthy but it was absolutely delicious. The one thing he told me was, do not subsitute bacon, it has to be pancetta.",

As Italian red sauces always taste better the next day. Note: I am in Europe and had a hard time finding the specified veal chop and I ended up with a cut that was more intended for stew. But even though the result was a stew it was abasolutley delicious. I cant wait to make it again with or without the chops!",
