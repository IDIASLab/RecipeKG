I used a very small grater (because I didn't have a larger one) and it made the consistency almost like that of refried beans. I don't think that was Rani's intent but it was good. One mistake I made that I'll avoid next time is to limit the warming of the tortillas to only a minute... I left them in the oven for about 3-4 minutes and discovered they hardened and were difficult to roll.",
