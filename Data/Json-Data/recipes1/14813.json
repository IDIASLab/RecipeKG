The only change I make to the recipe is to add a 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract to up the mintyness factor. Here are my tips: 1)Make sure you crush the candy canes that you put in the cake finely so that they sort of melt in the batter during baking so that you don't get a crunchy bit of hard candy in the cake. 2) I use Duncan Hines Fudge Cake mix. I have tried others and they are also good but the D.H.Fudge is the best. 3) Make sure that you chop the chocolate very fine or you will have large chunks of hard chocolate in your cake. 4) Don't sprinkle the candy canes on the cake until just before serving. They begin to liquify soon after making contact with the cool whip and won't be as pretty but the still will be delicious:) I usually crush the candy canes coarser for the top of the cake. If you are short on time you can crush them all in a ziploc bag at the same time once you are done crushing shake the bag this will cause the biggest pieces to go to the top. Skim off the bigger pieces for the top of the cake and add the finer dust to the cake itself.",

I also baked it in a bundt pan instead of the 2 cake pans and served with a dollop of cool whip and a sprinkle of crushed candy canes. We loved the crushed candy canes in the cake and I don't think it changed the texture of the cake at all. Very moist and rich and definitely company worthy. Will definitely make again.",

The only real change I made was to make a mint buttercream frosting between the two halves of the cake (using creme de menthe) which made it even mintier and a little less cool whippy. The outside did turn pink after it had sat for about 1/2 an hour but I actually liked that - the candy cane powder made the cool whip taste slightly minty which was a bonus:) I took it to a party and it was devoured within minutes.",
