For me to eat a few strawberries, a glass of milk and some yogurt is too much effort and not all that appealing, but blending them altogether is a whole other story. I used cherry-vanilla yogurt and just a smidge of Equal, and I think the vanilla really contributed to the flavor too. I appreciated the lightness of it - very refreshing and goes down easy. This was simple, but excellent.",
