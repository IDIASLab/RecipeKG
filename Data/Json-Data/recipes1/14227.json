I usually use broth (or add a bit of bouillon in the water), add 1 tbs soy sauce and 1 tbs oyster sauce into it, and sprinkle a bit of pepper.\r\nI also use 1 tbs hoisin sauce and 1/4 tsp five spice powder in the chicken marinade. Sometimes I replace the chicken with pork or beef, and add 1 tbs chinese rice wine or dry sherry into the marinade. For quicker vegetable cooking, put a lid on your skillet/wok after you've added the water mixture, set the fire on high. In less than 5 minutes the veggies will be soft but still crunchy.",

On it's own, the pepper can be a little dominant as far as taste and bok choy doesn't seem necessary.  My suggestion is, use more soy and oyster sauce, cut out the pepper and leave the bok choy optional.  After that, it was sensational.  Adding a little more sugar and a chicken bouillon cube to the water doesn't hurt either.",

I would have thought the oyster sauce soy sauce and garlic all would have contributed great flavor but it all just sort of got lost. Perhaps some sherry toasted sesame oil and chicken broth would have helped. I did back off the pepper which seemed excessive because as the saying goes you can always add more but you can't take it away. I also steered away from the cooking method as directed. Since some of the ingredients require different cooking times I cooked them separately then combined it all at the end. I added mushrooms and served this over rice noodles which was a nice combo but unfortunately tonight's dinner was rather forgettable.",

Finally I found that the bok choy needed very very little cooking - I stirred it in covered the pan for about 3 mins and it was tender crisp. Perfect! This would be great with carrots peppers bean sprouts mushrooms etc and I would be interested in making it again with a handful of chopped peanuts or cashews. Very versatile! Thanks unieng!",
