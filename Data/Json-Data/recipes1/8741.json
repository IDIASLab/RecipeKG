I used the bottled Key Lime juice instead of regular lime and my sister and I (who are both avid Key Lime pie fans) thought the tartness was perfect, but my husband thought it a little too tart and added whipped cream to the top of his to cut the tartness. We all agreed the only way to improve this would be to melt white chocolate and pour a thin layer over the crust before adding the filling. I also used the graham cracker crust. I will be making this frequently this summer!",

Some reviewers said only 3/4cup lime juice would be better so I started with that tasted it and decided to add more so it was probably just under 1 cup. I also used real whipped cream (had some leftover) and a store-bought graham cracker crust. It was delicious creamy a pretty color and not too sweet or too tart. There was enough filling leftover to make a little parfait. Mine was a bit gooey I found it's better frozen and served straight out of the freezer.",

I also recommend making (and baking 8 min) your own graham cracker crust. And ditch the Cool Whip ....use fresh whipped whipping cream instead and you won't regret it. Note: only add 1 tsp powdered sugar to the whipping cream.  This adaptation is VERY rich, but has just the right tartness and not overwhelmingly sweet.",
