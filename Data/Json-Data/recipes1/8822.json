I love the texture and flavor the cream cheese imparts. The fruit addition is a subtle, fragrant touch--and it makes a nice appearance. I only used 1/4 tsp of salt, because that amount of cream cheese has plenty of salt. I also prefer a slightly sweeter bread so I added additional sugar. I might not use quite as much cream cheese next time. I agree with Holly--a good base recipe and one I will definitely use again.",

I let the dough rise a little longer in the bread machine (it needed another 40 minutes) then I formed the dough & covered it with butter pecan pieces and sugar & cinnamon. Rolled up and cut and put in buttered pan (large deep dish pizza pan) and let rise another 40 minutes & topped with a little more butter pecans and sugar & cinnamon. Baked at 350 for about 30 minutes. Made an icing of 2 cups powdered sugar splash of pure vanilla about 3 TBSP. of melted butter and a 3-4 TBSP. of milk. My house smells heavenly! Thanks for sharing your recipe (this is a keeper)!!",

I warmed the milk then added the sugar and yeast and let that sit while I melted the butter (instead of margarine) and warmed the cream cheese and let the egg warm on the stove. Then I dumped the butter cream cheese and egg on the yeast/milk mixture added flour then salt and let the bread machine work: White 2 lbs pounded down the bread a little after the 2nd rising. It smelled great when baking and rose very nice and fluffy. It's a cheese bread so it's heavy but yummy. I think me and my bread machine are now best buds.",
