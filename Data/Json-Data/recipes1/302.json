I read how some of the reviewers found it too sticky so I let it boil a bit longer then suggested to make it harden more. It was a bit greasy when first out of the oven but when somewhat cooled cut them up and put in a container. The next day they were hard without being too hard. Perfect. Also used \"Trail Mix\" (mixture of nuts-eg. peanuts sunflower seeds pumpkin seeds almonds etc.) instead of hazelnuts and thought this worked really well. Will definitely make these again!!",

Reduced the amount of honey to 1 tbs. This in a way reduced the stickiness. Refrigeration is a must for this bars. In the humid tropical heat here they became very soft and attracted insects of every kind. First the ants came then the fruit flies then finally the spiders who came and ate up the earlier insects:) I used airtight bags to carry them around.",
