NOTE: This can be made healthier with ground turkey or chicken and spiced up to make taste like ground pork with brown sugar, sage, red pepper flake, marjoram, fresh ground pepper and a little salt.

I also use one package of onion soup mix instead of the chopped onion.  They always turn out fantastic and I was happy that I followed the recipe directly the first time I made it.  When I did make them for the first time I thought that they were going to be too runny because it seemed that there was a lot of milk and egg, giving it a very soft texture. However, I was wrong! They turned out perfect, and even better the second time when I used the onion soup mix. Thanks for the best meatball recipe I've ever tasted!",
