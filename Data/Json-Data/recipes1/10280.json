I basted it about 5 times during baking, and each time I sprinkled a little sugar on top too!  It was moist and just sweet enough.  It even tasted better the next day straight out of the refrigerator! ***Update*** I made this again for St. Pat's and decided to add a touch more salt, 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/4 and I added a touch more buttermilk to get it a little more moist.  I baked it at 340 degrees for 50 minutes basting it 3 times and each time I sprinkled sugar all over the top again.  It was perfect and everyone raved about it!  The crust was crunchy and sugary and the inside was moist and sweet!  *Update #2*  Use Kerrygold Irish butter in place of the margarine if you can find it, it's fantastic!!!  Really puts it over the top.",

You can get a good one for under twenty dollars, and you will be amazed at how wonderful some of your favorite baked goods turn out - they will seem so much more \"professional\". Also, I like to coat the very bottom of the loaf in a bit of cornmeal - helps to keep the loaf from sticking and burning. ",
