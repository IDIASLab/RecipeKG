I also used a can of ready cut tomatoes and a can of ortega diced green chilis instead of jalapenos it was mild with perfect flavor. Also the next time I make it I will use minute rice instead of regular rice as it took forever for the rice to cook. I then added about a 3/4 cup of enchilada sauce to give it a little extra kick and mixed in a blend of shredded cheeses and topped it off with more cheese on top. It really was incredibly easy fast and fantastic my family really loved it even the picky eaters. This will be a regular on the menu at our home. Thanks for the wonderful fast and easy recipe!",

For my own taste also celery salt seasoning salt 3 stalks celery mushrooms 1/4 c. chicken broth and a bunch of broccoli (to make a full meal from the dish).

I dont think it is too spicy but then again I do like spicy food!:O) I cooked for an hour and it didnt come out mushy at all. After I took it out of the oven I sprinkled some cheddar and monterrey jack cheese on top and recovered it with the foil so the cheese could melt. I also had a fresh jalepeno from the garden I added gave it an extra kick! This is a definite favorite on my list. Will make again! Good job!:O)",
