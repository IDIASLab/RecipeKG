Since 1947 when he came to Canada he has only had them rarely so he was thrilled when I made some and took them to him yesterday.  Both he and my Mum say that they are the best they have ever tasted.  This was the second time I have used the recipe and I was better at them this time.  I have made a couple of minor adjustments - the puff pastry I buy comes in two rolled squares.  I find that by just cutting each into four squares I can still form them into rounds after filling them and turning them over.  This saves having to cut them into circles.  I also didn't like to throw out the egg yolk so I add that to the filling.  It didn't seem to alter the taste or the result.  Thanks again for a great recipe I know I am going to use again and again.",

I added extra butter to see if that was the problem but no still no melting. I added the rest of the ingredients as instructed and decided to continue on with unmelted sugar. The amount of filling was almost three times more than what I needed how'd that happen? I'm positive I measured everything correctly. I ended up throwing away more than half the filling! I will try them again next weekend to see if it turns out any differently but I'm wondering if anyone else had any similar problems? Doesn't sound like it.",
