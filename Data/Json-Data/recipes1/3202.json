Neither my husband nor my child would eat them. They left a horrible taste in our mouths. I would definitely not recommend anyone make these its a waste of time money and ingredients.",

I'm not exactly sure what to do to fix the recipe and make the cookies better. Instead I turned my lemons into lemonade. I froze the cookies and then made them into fine crumbs for a pie crust. Great as a crust bad as a cookie. Sorry",

I was in a hurry so I could surprise them and made the mistake of not reading the reviews. These cookies were terrible!!!! I followed the recipe exactly as it was printed. When my 7-year old daughter (who of course LOVES cookies)took one bite and then offered the rest of her cookie to my wife I knew they were bad. My wife said \"No Thanks\" and my daughter said \"Please take it!\" I'll have to agree that it was a waste of ingredients and time. My wife mentioned the aftertaste that they left. From now on I will read the reviews before trying a recipe.",
