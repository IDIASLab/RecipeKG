As far as those reviewers suggesting to add cornstarch, I've got to say 3/4 of the way through cooking I was tempted to throw it out and start again with cornstarch as it was still really thin.  But then I just decided that the problem was that on low heat it would take forever to caramalize the sugars enough to thicken the milk.  So I just turned up the heat, started stirring like mad, and it did thicken beautifully.  I would think that if you did this AND added cornstarch your resulting frosting would be the consistancy of rubber boots, so if you're too scared to turn up the heat, do the cornstarch, if you're no stranger to candy making, by all means leave the cornstarch out and crank the heat up after all the ingredients have gotten warm on low.",

                "reviewBody": "This frosting was fabulous!!  I did not alter any of the ingredients listed.  I agree with other reviewers, it does NOT need cornstarch.  Based on other reviews, I added all ingredients, except the vanilla and nuts, into  saucepan and cooked over 2-3 level heat for about 6-7 minutes, stirring occasionally (while it was warming, I toasted the coconut and pecans in the oven 5 min at 350).  Once the butter was thoroughly melted and the mixture was smooth, I turned up the heat to between 6-7 and continued to cook for another 6-7 minutes until the mixture started to boil.  After it started to boil, I continued to cook, stirring constantly, for another 6-7 minutes.  At the end of the 6-7 minutes, the mixture should just be getting into the soft candy stage (higher than 200 deg).  If you are unfamiliar with this, it will seem like the mixture is starting to pull away from the edges of the pan and the bubbles will start making a popping noise more than a rolling boil type sound.  Once it reaches this stage, I cooked for about 2 more minutes then removed from heat.  I added the vanilla and mixed to blend then added the toasted cooconut and pecans.  I left the mixture in the sauce pan on the back of the stove as I made the cake.  By the time the cake was cooled, the frosting was a perfect consistency and was the exact amount needed for a 13x9 cake.  Turned out magnificient, looked great and tasted even better.  Thanks Carol!!",

I followed the directions just as the cook wrote out.....and at the end I realized I had forgotten to add the cornstarch as everyone else had suggested......So I added it to the mixture....and it did not help at all.....I added more and more...until finally I realized it was not helping and altering the texture of the it....  So there must be a trick or something with activation when you mix the cornstarch with the evaporated milk...b/c it didnt work when it was all over and done with....I would try this again, because the flavor was excellent like I said...there was a heavy topping of coconut/pecan ingredients, and beneath that was all the liquid...  It was a waste, we didnt even use it...HOWEVER, the chocolate cake recipe I used was \"Too Much Chocolate Cake\" and it was heavenly...mmm...i'll be making that cake again for the 4th of July coming up.   I just cant figure out why the cook would give a recipe that wouldnt come out right...  The miserable part was that it wasted my time, and money... the other recipe I made was baklava and it turned out great lol, better luck next time \"?\"",
