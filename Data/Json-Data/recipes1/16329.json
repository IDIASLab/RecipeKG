There was just a little something that didn\u2019t quite measure up for me, and I think that may have been the flavor of the baking mix.  To compensate for that, I think I\u2019ll add a little vanilla or almond extract the next time which might give it a little extra pop of flavor and mask the baking mix.  But I\u2019m not complaining, these really are quite tasty and tender.  Used a small cookie scoop which worked perfectly for filling the mini muffin cups.  Thanks for sharing Darice Baird, I\u2019ll make this again.",

I didn't want to turn on the oven so I made regular size muffins which made 9, and baked them in my convection toaster oven for 13 minutes.  I will make them again but use my mini muffin pan and the big oven.  Very easy to make when you don't want to go through all the trouble of regular batter.",
