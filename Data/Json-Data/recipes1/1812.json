After 4 minutes of mixing with the dough-hook there were a lot of dry crumbs not being incorporated into the dough so I added ONE Tablespoon additional evaporated milk. That did the trick and after another 4 minutes it was a nice firm ball of dough. The bread tasted wonderful. I had my doubts when I got a strong whiff of the Cardamom when I added it but it turned out to be just the right amount for a delicate peppery-sweet tea bread. I might add a bit more sweet next time.",

There's not nearly enough liquid in the recipe and my machine was straining to mix it. All I could hear were these strange sounds coming out of it like it was about to quit on me. Anyway I immediately added another 1/4 cup of water and it still wasn't enough so I added close to 1/4 cup of evaporated milk as well. And when I took it out of the machine later it still was quite dry and not sticky at all. With that said I did find it to be a very tasty loaf even with the substitution of 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg in place of the cardamom. It tasted just like cinnamon raisin bread without the raisins. I will make this again but use 1/2 cup of water and 3/4 cup of evaporated milk and I'll make sure I'll be around to check on it - just in case!",

I would use 1/2 cup honey for this bread, or up to 3/4 C sugar. Traditional Scandinavian/-Americans braid the bread, brush with beaten egg and sprinkle with large - (size AA) sugar crystals for a holiday treat.  I  f you want to get really serious about your cardamon bread you can use it to make open faced sandwiches with Rulla p\u00f8lse.

My Grandma used to make the julekage and always did one extra loaf with just the cardamom in it. We would use it for breakfast toast on the days after Christmas.",
