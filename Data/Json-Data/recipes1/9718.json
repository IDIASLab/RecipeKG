I think the key is letting the sugar caramelize before adding the cream to make the caramel. I made it for a dinner party and everyone raved about it. The chocolate cream has more of a dark chocolate taste so it's not that sweet but the whole thing was very good. I'm also not sure why they said to refrigerate the dough for so long before making the crust. This made the dough impossible to work and I had to wait for it to warm up to room temperature again. In future I would only chill the dough for 20 minutes or so not two hours.",

My carmel was runny after letting it cool and setting up for 4 hours in the frige. I added about 1/4 c. pwd. sugar to the choco. mixture and I think that helped it set up. It wasn't very sweet at all. Will not make again.",
