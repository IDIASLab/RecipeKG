Then I add 3 cups sugar 3 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp cloves and a dash of salt. Cook it for 10-12 hours blend and pour into jars. I don't can/preserve it just refrigerate--it goes so fast it's not around for long! I think the original recipe would have been way to sweet--and would have made too little!

I also cut the cinnamon in half with the second batch and found it better 4tsp is just TOO over powering. The concept of the slowcooker was perfect the amount of cooking time was perfect. My family can't get enough of MY version. I hope others will try this recipe and do it to their tastes. It's better than jam thanks for inspiring me with this recipe. Cheers!!",

Then a stick blender toward the end of the process kick up the heat to high again just to get rid of any extra moisture. So delicious. Mini mason jars do the trick for gifts. Not sure how long it lasts (safely). But I actually like it after it has been opened for a couple weeks (less sweet). Will probably just use less sugar next batch though.",

I boiled for 1 hour on high stirred and let it cook on low for several hours while I made supper and went about my day. I did throw it into the blender and was worried about the consistancy but after canning and leaving overnight it was perfect. This has to be the best apple butter I have ever tasted. Used tart green apples and it came out perfect not to sweet or over-powering - apple butter IS meant to go on toast. People that complained about the sweetness must be eating it right from the jar. Would have liked a more in depth explanation on how to store unused jars - refridgerate? cold room? Thanks for a great recipe!",
