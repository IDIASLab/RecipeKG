This recipe can EASILY be halved (I know, I've made it once per week for the last 2 weeks). I added 1 tsp of dill weed (considering I halved the recipe) and I don't use tomatoes as it tends to get soggy as it sits.  I have also found that the finely shredded cheese works much better for slicing and serving.  I could almost eat the whole thing myself! VERY GOOD and I plan to bring it to most parties I attend in the upcoming weeks as it is soooo easy to make...esspecially if you have a food processor for the veggies!",

I used a 15 x 10 pan and there was plenty of sauce. Mine was going to sit in the fridge for awhile and I was afraid of sogginess from the tomato so i used chopped red pepper instead so I could still get the red color in there!",
