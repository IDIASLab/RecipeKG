Though they smelled divine while baking, the taste left much to be desired.  After all the word of chopping fresh chives and parsley, you couldn't even taste them! Besides that, the rolls were flat and just looked sad.  The second time I made the recipe I tripled the herbs and made only 15 rolls.  I also added some butter and fresh garlic to the egg white brush on.  The results were steller.  The rolls tasted slightly herby and were big and fluffy.  I whipped some of the leftover chives into butter, making chive butter, and served it alongside the rolls.  They were a big hit this way.",
