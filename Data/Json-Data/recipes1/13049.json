I cut the potatoes into sticks like normal fries and then baked them for 15 minutes, turned them over, and baked for another 15 minutes (the whole time at 425 since they're thinner than wedges), and I must say these are the tastiest fries ever!  I also added salt and freshly ground pepper and garlic salt, and didn't measure it out- just kinda put on as much as looked good, and wow, were they tasty!  I think the chili powder was what really put them over the top, so don't be shy with it, and remember that seasonings seem to lose some of their flavors when baked (which means put on more than you usually would)!",

                "reviewBody": "These were phenomenally good!  Quick and easy - and much tastier than the frozen variety.  \n\nCooking time and temperature will vary greatly on how thick you cut the wedges.  I followed the recommendations of others and reduced the cooking time and temp to 425\u00b0F.  However, after 30 min it was not ready.  I had to increase the temperature to 475\u00b0F in order to ensure they would be ready in time for dinner.  So, if you cut your wedges small and thin - you will need to cut the temp and cooking time.  But if you cut true (thick) wedges - follow the recipes directions (although I strongly encourage flipping the potatoes halfway through the process).  For a super easy cleanup - I poured the oil and spices into a gallon size Ziploc bag and mixed it all together until well blended - then I added the cut potatoes and kneaded and shook the bag until all the potatoes were well and evenly coated.  Then poured it into a 9x13 glass baking dish lined with foil.  \n\nMinor adjustments:  I used paprika, garlic powder, salt, freshly ground black pepper, a pinch of chili powder - mine is exceptionally potent, and cumin)... The second time making this recipe I added fresh minced onion - and that was a very tasty addition too!",

My advice is, don't just close the oven door and forget it. Check on the progress every 5 minutes or so and take them out when they are brown and done.",
