I loved the concept but I did change this up as I thought the amounts of the ingredients listed might be a bit much. For a 6 oz. can of tuna I used about 2 Tbsp. of Hellman's light mayo 1 Tbsp. of chopped celery 2 tsp. of chopped red onion a little garlic powder salt pepper and a splash of red wine vinegar. I let that chill while I hollowed out a large tomato and made a bed of lettuce on a plate. I then spooned the chilled tuna salad inside the tomato and served it with a couple slices of melba toast. This turned out to be a really good low fat lunch that I didn't have to feel guilty about!",
