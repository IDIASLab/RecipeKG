I could only remember that sour cream, lemon juice, eggs, butter and sugar were in the recipe... I was about 12 when mom lost the recipe. But alas, when I saw the cornstarch...I knew I'd found the right one. Eureka! I will be making this one this week!!  I'm so happy this recipe was here! In 1990, We drove almost 2 hrs away to get the recipe from the original friend who shared it with mom...stopping by her work then her home to no avail. Moms old co-worker could not remember which recipe and no longer had it. She has since passed but I'll always remember Benny as moms best friend who introduced us to the best lemon pie I'd ever tasted. She was darn good at peanut brittle too. But I digress.  So welcome back \"lemon pie\"!!! We've been suffering with horrible impersonations of you for > 20 years. If you weren't covered with whip cream, I'd hug you! yummmmm...",
