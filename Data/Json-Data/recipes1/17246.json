The sub is 1 1/2 tspns baking powder & 1/2 tspn salt per 1 cup of flour.)so I have no intention of being too critical. They did remind me of scones in appearance although not in taste (& there is actually a very similar recipe on here for ice cream scones) as they were soft and chewy on the inside. I'm wondering if it was the ice cream I used; its homemade and perhaps not even ice cream (I forgot to check what id labeled it b4 dumping it out of my container--its either ice cream or frozen yogurt) or just how they are supposed to turn out. Would be good with jelly or peanut butter--or both! Thanks for the recipe!",
