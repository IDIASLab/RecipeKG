I did however take the advice of one comment that suggested I scale the recipe to 36 servings for a 9x13 pan and it was a perfect measure.  On making this a second time I made 2 changes: First I swapped 1/2 the white sugar for packed brown sugar and instead of allspice I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Both ways are great, the moistest recipe I've ever made!",

I made a banana cake using recipe from this site that called for sour milk and wish I could go back and change that rating to maybe a 4 because the flavor and texture of this cake is excellent, much better.  I will make this again with margarine instead of butter or less butter.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  Try the Butter Cream Frosting II submitted by Kris, also a keeper.",

It never fails to get rave reviews, and it's so simple to make. I have adjusted the serving size up to 48 and baked it in two 8\" round pans, a 9\" pan, and some individual silicone baking cups for the leftovers. I've also baked it into a 9x13 pan as well. No matter what size you do, it'll always come out right. Usually I follow the recipe exactly, but I've also sub'd Greek yogurt for some of the butter, did 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar, doubled the allspice, and added nuts. Frosting it with cream cheese frosting spiked with Nutella will make your toes curl and just drizzling it with some Greek yogurt mixed with honey and vanilla (instead of an all-out frosting job) before serving will get you marriage proposals! You just can't screw this one up!",

I also halved the sugar, halved the amount of butter and replaced it with canola oil, and replaced the eggs with two egg whites per whole egg.
