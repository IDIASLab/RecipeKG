However instead of chopped walnut I grind the walnuts into almost powder in a food processor to throw them in with the dry ingredients. In addition I substitute cloves for allspice. Turn out that this is one of the most delicious carrot cake. The fact that we have to precook the carrots and the natural oil from the ground up walnuts works wonders.",

Every bite is full of raisin-walnut-spice deliciousness! Be aware of the baking time though. At about 45 min the top will start getting burned. Also in my opinion 1 tsp. of cloves was too much it overshadows the other flavors. Same goes for the nutmeg. I would go with 1/2 tsp. of cloves and 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg. I added 1 tsp. of ground ginger it's a good combination with the carrots. And perhaps if you don't like a too sweet cake you could cut back on the sugar a bit because the raisins keep it sweet enough. I used 1 tsp. of baking soda and 1 tsp. of baking powder because I was afraid 2 tsp. of baking soda would affect the taste.... Those are my suggestions but even exactly as it is written it is excellent. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",

I agree with another reviewer that it is more like quick bread, but never-the-less it is excellent.  Moist, tender, flavorful.   That being said, I made a couple of changes for my preferences:  doubled the spices; decreased baking soda to 1 tsp and added 1 tsp baking powder.  Also added crushed pineapple and used the juice to make up some of the liquid.  Decreased sugar to 1 cup: half brown and half white (Whey-Low).  Used 2 cups grated carrots.  What a great recipe.  Cooking all the fruit and veggies for a few minutes has to be the secret to the moistness.  I let it cool thoroughly before baking.  Baked in an 11x7 baking dish to make a single layer to cut into squares for lunch boxes.  My family was in heaven.  I bet it will be better in a couple of days--if it lasts that long. thank you so much  Judy in WA  ",
