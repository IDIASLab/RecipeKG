I brushed the garlic butter onto the biscuits before and after baking. These baked up beautifully and tasted great!",

I had about 1/3 cup swiss cheese I had left over from another recipie so I added that and 2/3 cup cheddar to make one cup. Very Good. The only thing I would change is the amount of red pepper flakes. I coundn't see or taste them. I would add at least 2 teaspoons (probably more though) My kids (3 and 8 years) had no problem eating them as the recipie stated. I just want a more red pepper flavor.",

I followed the advice of other reviewers and increased the red pepper to a heaping teaspoon and I'm glad I did as they are not too spicy at all. I also used a mix of mozzarella and cheddar added a bit more garlic powder and a teaspoon of Italian seasoning blend. These are very savory and are great with soup or stew. I do recommend adding the Italian seasoning as it really brought out the other flavors. I will use use this again thanks (:",
