Avocado and feta and the occasional cool bite of cucumber or spicy red onion; the dijon and lemon is phenomenal! SOOO mouth-watering! Even my kids (four and 1.5 yrs) devoured this. I made a double batch, we were nibbling on it still warm from the quinoa. \n\nI DID keep the kale raw, to retain nutrients. I massaged and kneaded the torn up leaves with a bit of salt; and put some of them in a large plastic bag and let my kids fling it around. This is soo soo soooo delicious!!",

I have made it many times and have just done a couple of changes. I substitute chicken broth instead of the water to cook the quinoa in. I add cherry tomatoes cut in half to the salad and I add a little more lemon and 1 clove of garlic finely chopped to the dressing. Thank you for the recipe!",

Instead of serving the quinoa and veggies on top of the kale, I mixed the kale in with the quinoa and veggies (except the tomato and avocado)  and 1/2 of the dressing and refrigerated overnight so all the flavors would meld.  In the morning, I added the tomato and avocado and the remainder of the dressing - it was more like a cold pasta or potato salad type salad.  It was amazing!!!!",

I couldn't use a whole bunch of kale (it wouldn't fit in the pot) but it was more than enough for the two of us. I also steamed the kale a big longer but before it was mushy. Also since I don't like feta cheese I substituted gorgonzola which was still tasty. Next time I'll use a whole avocado and add more of the bell pepper and cucumber.
