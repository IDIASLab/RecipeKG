Some like more lemonade, some like more iced tea some like a lighter taste (more water) on either the tea or lemon.  Ideally an Arnold Palmer is a part tea and part lemonade.  I used green tea and old fashioned lemonade.  You can use any tea, pink or regular lemonade, home made or artificial.  THANKS",
