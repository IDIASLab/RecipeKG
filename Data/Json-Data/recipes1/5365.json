It's exactly as sweet as I was hoping for with a honey bread. It's fluffy, moist, flavorful - just perfect. Oh! Wait, I did use 1 tsp of orange extract instead of zest, and I didn't detect any orange flavor, but I think it was perfect the way it was. I'll probably just omit it altogether next time. Highly recommend you give this one a whirl if you're looking for a sweet bread. I used the 2 lb loaf setting with 1/3 of the recipe, medium crust, and white loaf. Came out perfect as you can see in my picture :). Enjoy!",

I made a 1/3 of the recipe and was able to make 2 small loaves. My pans are 8x5 as opposed to a 9x5 loaf pan so I can typically make smaller loaves with them. However I could've let it rise longer for a larger loaf. I don't really taste the orange so I'd add more orange zest or use some oj next time. All in all this is a nice rye. Thanks for the recipe.",
