I'm glad we did. Don't have a potato masher so used a portable mixer and added enough milk so that it was the consistency of mashed potatoes. The uncooked shredded carrots adds a nice texture and taste. Will buy rutabaga and make this again!",

Thank you for a yummy and easy recipe great for first-timers. Yes rutabagas are not easy to chop up... but use a quality knife and put a little muscle in it! It's worth it! Preparing and cooking the rutabagas was very similar to making mashed potatoes: the boiling times are about the same and mashing them is about the same. Thank You for making me a rutabaga lover. This will now be incorporated into regular meal plans.",

The carrots tone down the unique taste of the root and with just butter a bit of salt and pepper........ good for you. If one is used to sugared and seasoned foods this recipe is not for you unless you add to it. Why not enjoy the rutabaga for itself?",
