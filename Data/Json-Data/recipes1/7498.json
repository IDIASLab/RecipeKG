This recipe was so delicious it prompted me to make a profile so I could review it! \n\nFirst off, venison is so tough and mildly gamey tasting. So, I have never been thrilled when my husband cooks it. It was always so tough and gummy. I felt like I would never chew it enough to swallow it. \n\nI thought it would be great to slow cook this type of meat to help tenderize it. I ran across this recipe and boy were we surprisingly impressed. I didn't change a thing in the recipe. I cooked it for 2 hours, added the carrots and tatoes and cooked it until they were tender. \n\nThen I served it over mashed potatoes. This was so good I wish my mouth was bigger. \n\nTry this, you will not be disappointed. ",

I don't understand why people rate low because you can \"still taste the deer\" If you don't like wild meat, don't eat it! doesn't mean the recipe was gross! I ran out of worcestershire so i made a substitution with soya/hot sauce combo (yes this is a valid sub!) I also didn't have oregano and substituted it for italian seasoning instead.  I seasoned my meat with garlic powder, seasoning salt and roasted red pepper flakes and browned it with the onions in a frying pan.  I then put it all in a roaster and cooked it in the oven for an hour at 425.  I cut my potatoes smaller as a personal preference and added the potatoes and carrots and popped it back in the oven for another half hour.  This was an excellent recipe! The flavour is perfect,and the meat is extremely tender. Love it! will definitely make this again and again! thank you for sharing!",
