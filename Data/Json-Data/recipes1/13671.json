                "reviewBody": "This is a good recipe that can be made better with some easy changes. First I just used 1 cup of minute brown rice because it's way easier. I didn't use mustard to season the inside; instead I used seasoning salt. Then I threw the following in a deep pot and cooked until the meat was browned and vegetables translucent: 1/2 cup chopped onion 2 stalks of celery chopped and garlic with 1 pound of ground pork. I've used Jimmy Dean's sage pork sausage with really tasty results too. I don't usually drain the meat because the moisture helps keep the finished product from drying out too much as some of the other reviewers noted. The celery gives it a nice element and I'm thinking about adding mushrooms next time too. Then I took it off the heat and added the rice 1 tsp salt 1 tsp worchestire 1 tsp dried ground sage and 1/2 tsp pepper. After it was cool enough that I wouldn't scramble my eggs I added only 2 eggs. I cooked the pumpkin for about 2 hours at 350 in a water-filled dish covered with foil. This recipe makes for a great presentation on a Halloween or Thanksgiving buffet line and it tastes great. You just have to make sure the pumpkin is soft enough that you scoop its meat out along with the pork mixture. Also leftovers can be scraped out of the shell and actually taste better the second time around after the pumpkin is microwaved and gets even softer.",
