I didnt use nearly as much pesto as suggested I just coated the fillet generously I didnt measure just put on a thick coat.

Once the fillets are coated with pesto, begin by placing your baking sheet on the stove burner, just for a couple of minutes to give the bottom of the fish a head start.  Move to the broiler (approx 8 inches from flame) until browned.  Then reset oven to 350 and bake for a few minutes til its to your liking.  This is the method I've used and it's worked like a charm.",

I took some other suggestions and baked the fish first - 400 degrees for 15 minutes - then put on the pesto and broiled it on low for 5 minutes, high for 3. HOWEVER, the pesto wasn't crispy how I would've liked - next time, I think I'll bake for 10 minutes, then add the pesto and broil on high for at least 10 minutes to make it nice and browned. The only changes I made to the ingredients was not using as much pesto as was called for. Will definitely make this again!",
