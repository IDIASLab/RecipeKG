Don't be fooled by its simplicity, and don't leave out the fennel seed, as it really complements the flavour of the black-eyed peas and the spinach.  I only had whole fennel seeds so I used those.  The only change I would make is to cook the whole dish over the stove as I don't see the point of transferring it to another dish just to finish it in the oven.",
