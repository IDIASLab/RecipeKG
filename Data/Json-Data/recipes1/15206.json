I didn't use sage, and I'm glad I didn't. Use some chicken thighs with this, it really makes a tastier dish. I cooked the chicken in veggie stock, saved the remaining liquid after they were done, and drizzled it into the pilaf with the chicken for the last step. It helped incorporate the chicken flavor through out, instead of just pilaf with some chicken stirred in. I did reduce it to 2 carrots instead of 3, and didn't notice a carrot shortage at all. I find that an initial rinse of quinoa in a pour spout measuring cup, then pouring it into a cheese cloth, making like a tennis ball shape with it, works fantasticly. Then I can strain it and squeeze it right under the water, it's very quick and effective. (I don't have a mesh screen) Just add a little more quinoa, to make up for what gets stuck in the cloth. Next time I'm going to add some curry, or maybe some coconut milk. ",

At the end I put in cooked finely chopped chicken breast for hubby and the kids and chick peas for myself. It was so good everyone ate it all up and I have a very fussy family. As a side note coconut oil does not provide much flavor I use it as a healthier alternative to vegetable oil when I don't want that bitterness that olive oil can add.",
