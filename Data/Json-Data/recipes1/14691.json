The second time I made them I added some onion a little garlic powder and a sprinkle of Mrs. Dash Tomato Basil & Garlic seasoning.

I could not keep the mushroom mixture and cheese on top of the pastry and had to use a knife and fork.....not convenient for an appetizer. I agree with most of the comments that more blending of the flavors is necessary along with other ingredients like onions and peppers. I think baking the mushrooms and cheese inside a pastry would keep the appetizer together and blend the flavors.",
