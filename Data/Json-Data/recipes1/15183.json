                "reviewBody": "This sorbet was certainly very easy to make. The only changes I made were to add a bit of lemon zest with the raspberries and to put the mixture in my ice cream maker for 30 minutes before putting it in the freezer. The flavor is very nice. The lemon cuts the sweetness of the raspberry and gives it a little bit of tang. It's very refreshing. I think what threw me off was the texture. I could really feel and taste the Jell-o in this sorbet and not in a good way. Despite whisking the mixture well little lumps of Jell-o remained in the final product and I didn't find that appealing. Also the Jell-o gave the sorbet the taste of artificial sweeter which I didn't like. I might make this again but probably minus the Jell-o.",

                "reviewBody": "This was very easy a bit pricey though and hard to calculate for a Canadian. Just so others know in Canada our cool whip tub comes in 1L this means you need to use 3 cups of it for this recipe not the whole thing. Also if you get a regular can of lemonade it's 12 ounces so you need to use half of it. I would not make this again as I feel guilty about eating whipped oil/fructose corn syrup products but if you are allergic to dairy it's a great option. More lemon would be nice maybe giving it a kick with some rind or juice you can always taste it before you freeze it:)",
