The dough was too thick for my bread machine to knead, so I ended up mixing and kneading by hand. I found the texture to be a bit dense and chewy, but it made a great dipping bread (my family thought it tasted great with extra virgin olive oil).",

Still that's not a big deal--it all depends on the humidity when you make it that depends on how much flour you need. It's a bit crumbly although I'm thinking that might be my fault. I set the timer then went downstairs so I couldn't hear it...oops! Bread didn't burn just got a bit over done so the crust was hard to cut. Other than that it is a good basic bread. nothing spectacular but it's good for sandwiches if a bit crumbly (but again that might be bc I overbaked it a bit). Thanks for the recipe!",
