Toothpicks held them together just fine while I browned them. I think next time I make this, I am going to just make a big pan of the stuffing and top it with the browned chicken breasts. I loved this stuffing and wanted more then the breasts held. I seasoned the stuffing with a little poultry seasoning.. delish. I also left out the cheese because I forgot to buy some. I'll be making this often.",

I can't believe how moist they were. Added another point for browning breasts in oil after coating them with flour (how else were you supposed to brown them?) You need to finely chop veggies. I used the 4 oz. individually packaged breasts. Use them partially frozen for easier slitting. So, so good:)\n\nFast forward to summertime: Made them again last night. Breasts were thawed already so when I found that I couldn't cut a pocket in them, I layered the bottom of the dish with the filling, layed the browned breasts on top, covered and baked for 30 mins!  Easy, delicious!",

To keep the chicken moist I added some olive oil to the bottom of the baking pan and covered it in aluminum foil which worked wonderfully. Stuffing the chicken was a bit difficult but certainly worthwhile because it tasted great. I also put the extra stuffing on the side.",
