Just small differences between the two recipes, but after reading this recipe I think I'll continue to make it the way I have been all these years. I add 3 T. sugar to the crust. And I guess I've always saved five minutes, since I've beat the buttercream 15 minutes and it's always been great. Back then I didn't have a stand mixer, so I'll bet even 15 minutes of beating isn't necessary if you do use one. I use 3-5 bananas, sliced into coins. I don't drain the pineapple -- why waste the good juices? I cook the undrained pineapple with 1 T. cornstarch over medium heat till thickened, then cool and spread over the filling. I don't use strawberries only because I know they can get \"oozie\" and watery as the dessert stands. After topping with the Cool Whip (a 12 oz. container is plenty) I garnish the top with finely chopped nuts and maraschino cherries. This dessert is to-die-for good, but VERY rich, so serve in small pieces!",
