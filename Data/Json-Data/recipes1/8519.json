Instead of greasing the skillet, I plopped some butter in the skillet and set it in the oven to melt while the oven preheated. I took WhataDish's suggestion to use a medium sized saucepan to make the buttermilk sauce in and she was right on. I've made the Absolute Best Pancake Syrup from this site many times and the syrup from this recipe almost exactly mimics that recipe, minus the cinnamon. This was very good. It's almost like a pancake souffle.",

The buttermilk/caramel syrup is to die for!  It is very sweet but went well with the less than sweet pancakes.  I did follow the receipe to the letter but I am sure some substitutions could be done without problems.  Make sure you stir the sauce for the entire 7 minutes of boiling because you are making carmel syrup when you do this.  The caloric content on these is huge but the taste is amazing!  You might be able to make one batch of syrup to two batches of pancakes.  Amazing receipe~!  Stephanie",
