(To clarify a prior question below...you substitute the cold water in the jello mix with cold pop.  I always use a can of sunkist, mix 1/2 in with the jello and just pour the other half over the top as well.  I make it in a regular cake pan, one layer, with no whole fruit.  It keeps a little better and is a huge hit.  Tastes like a wonderfully yummy cream sickle.  YUM... Regular cake pan makes it a bit easier to make, very quick and clean...easy to store in the fridge as well.   :)",

I made two for a church function and the second one we chose to use orange jello and soda and it turned out awesome! I would like to try raspberry if I can find such a thing as raspberry soda. I was a little scared at the amount of liquid I was pouring into the cake. It was my mom's idea to serve the cake on little plates drizzled with chocolate syrup before placing a slice of cake on it and it gave a wonderful presentable effect. Will keep this recipe!",
