Next I omitted the botton layer of Nutella and instead scattered chocolate chips for a little crunch now and then. Then to reduce calories you can use light Cool Whip and low fat cream cheese. Make sure you soften the cream cheese first. After you remove the cream cheese from its wrapper place it in a bowl in the microwave for 30 seconds which makes the perfect consistency for blending. Mix with the Nutella till the cream cheese is thoroughly blended. Add Cool Whip and chocolate chips. I love that no baking is necessary. Use less Nutella for less chocolaty taste and density. It's all good. It's quick and easy and super for taking to dinner parties potlucks preparing for Thanksgiving or having guests. Prepare the night before and forget it till you need it. Use the cover that comes over the pie crust as the pie cover and it'll stay moist and be easy to transport. Enjoy!",

Some options: 1) Use different crusts as others have said. 2) When dividing the Nutella I doubled the amount you spread on the crust and used less for the filling. 3) Instead of Cool Whip I used real whipping cream whipped to stiff peaks and folded 1 cup into the chocolate/cream cheese mixture. Gives the pie a more dense texture and quite delicious. 4) Top with slivered almonds. 5) Haven't tried this yet but I'm thinking some mint extract in the filling? So many pie options so little time.",

Microwaving the cream cheese for 30 seconds as another reviewer suggested was an excellent idea it really made the filling easier to mix and lump free. I used an Oreo crust instead of graham or chocolate. The first helping we ate after having cooled it in the fridge for 4 hours. The rest we popped into the freezer and had the next day. I highly recommend only eating it frozen. It didn't turn into a hard rock like an ice cream pie remained smooth and creamy.",
