However, I did go along with some of the suggestions to reduce the amount of vegetable oil. I used 3/4 c. and the cake turned out moist with no oily taste. I also used 1 cup w. sugar and 1 cup brown sugar rather than all white. I opted for walnuts instead of raisins. It came out perfect in a 8X12 inch pan for 40 minutes in 350 degrees. I didn't try the glaze icing and went with the suggestions for the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe. I love cream cheese desserts and even though I used 95% fat free cream cheese it still tasted flavorful and rich. Awesome combination. Rave reviews came from all who tasted it.",

She says it is the best carrot cake she has ever had. The flavor was so wonderful and the cake was extremely moist. I think the cake gets better with sitting and allowing the raisins and spices to ferment into the cake... for several hours prior to serving.\r\nI recommend adding a bit more nutmeg then called for and I also added 1 teaspoon of genuine mexican vanilla to the batter as well. Mmmmmmm Enjoy this recipe. This cake will make many new friends for you.",

He then asked us what the \"orange\" things were and after we told him that they were carrots he said that he didn't realize that carrot cake actually had carrots in it. After we stopped laughing we realized that he wasn't kidding! Anyway the whole class loved it and the entire cake went in no time!",
