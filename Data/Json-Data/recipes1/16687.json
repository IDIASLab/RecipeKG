But, if you like carrot cake that won't be a problem! I cut back on the ginger and added some vanilla. I used a combination of walnuts and pecans, plus since I like things a bit sweeter I used vanilla yogurt vs. plain yogurt. I may add a little crushed pineapple to the reheated oatmeal for even more of  a \"carrot cake\" taste and to up the sweet factor. Thanks for a great recipe!",

I may even need to double the carrot! Next time I'll also add a little less apple. It tastes fine, but it overpowered the carrot. I also cut the raisins. \nIt was nice and easy to make it the night before, and reheat it for about a minute and half the next morning.I just have rolled oats instead of steel-cut, and halving the recipe and adjusting a few ingredients yielded me a nice, full breakfast. I dolloped it with nonfat Greek yogurt, and it was a nice touch. I'll certainly make this again, but try - just for fun - using instead a dollop of nonfat cream cheese! Both option sound awesome to me. \nI cut the ginger in half, cause even though I love ginger, it seemed like a bit much, and the ginger flavor I got was perfect! Subtle enough that it wasn't overpowering, but as a ginger-lover strong enough to give a tasty zing to the dish. \nOnce I find what this needs, I'll update and re-rate this review accordingly. Until then, I still say this is a great addition to my breakfast rotation!\nUPDATE: Definitely double the carrot! Also, the tip of adding a little pineapple juice is a small change that makes a great difference! Highly suggested. I also tried topping with nonfat cream cheese that I whipped with a few drops of vanilla. That was SO good! Fat free whipped topping prepared the same way would be good too!",

Thankfully I love carrot cake.  The flavor is pretty good - with the yogurt, you really get a carrot cake essence for breakfast.  This is not at all a sweet oatmeal - not like how most people enjoy a packet of instant oatmeal.  I suspect many will add sugar (or sweetened yogurt?) to the final dish.  And I personally will use half as much nutmeg next time - it was overpowering to me (and possibly increase the carrots).  But overall a great change from the norm.",

I reduced the amount to 2 Tbsp. and still felt as if all I were eating were raisins. Had I added the full 1/2c the entire bowl would have been nothing but raisins.",
