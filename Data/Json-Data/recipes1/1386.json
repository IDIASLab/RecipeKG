I noticed some people had trouble keeping the cake dense and with it overflowing. Remember, a pound cake is a very old style cake - long before electric mixers. The recipe states to stir in the flour and milk, so when using a mixer it must be slow and not for too long. Mixing it fast and for a long time will put too much air in the batter causing it to fluff up and loose the dense pound cake quality and rise too big.",

Instead of the almond extract(two tsp. seemed like too much to me) I added two TBS. of almond oil, 1/2 tsp. lemon extract and 1 tsp. of vanilla extract.  Instead of just regular shortening, I used butter flavor shortening.  I creamed the butter, shortening and sugar for 20 minutes which gives the cake a fluffy texture.  All of these changes made it great!",

With all our \"holiday people\" gone I'm left with an empty house and a full refrigerator and pantry including lots of leftover eggnog. I decided to use some of it in a cake and after looking over this recipe decided it was a good basic pound cake recipe that I could safely experiment with a little. Given that I replaced the milk with the sweet eggnog I knew I'd have to reduce the sugar but didn't want to reduce it so much that I'd be reducing some of the moisture in the cake as well. I settled at 2 cups. In keeping with the eggnog flavor I substituted 1-1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. rum extract for the almond extract and added 1/8 tsp. nutmeg to the flour mixture. I wasn't crazy about baking this at 300 degrees but since I had a dark pan I felt it would be okay. An hour and 15 minutes later the cake was done. This really is a lovely beautiful cake moist with a fine tender and dense crumb. Pound cake just as pound cake should be. As for my eggnog experiment it was a real happy result! Pleasantly eggnog flavored light \"mellow yellow\" and a perfect choice for this holiday season. This was just excellent on its own but I served it with a fresh tropical fruit medley and fresh whipped cream (more leftovers!). Make this recipe as is or make my eggnog cake experiment but either way I highly recommend it!",
