I didn't see any need to put them in the oven though as the bean/zucc mixture was plenty hot to melt the cheese right inside the tortilla. Didn't have red bells so just used green and I also added big handfuls of fresh cilantro to them. (WIN!) After grating the zucc & squash I pressed as much liquid out of them as I could. I also used a heaping spoonful of the \"Taco Seasoning I\" recipe on here during the last simmer of the beans/zucc/salsa. With a plop of sour cream the cilantro and the additional seasoning this was a great meal!",

I topped that with about 1/2 cup sour cream mixed with 1/2 cup green salsa and about 3/4 cup shredded cheese. Then I baked as per the directions.
