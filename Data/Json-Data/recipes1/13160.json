I would omit the butter and just use the spices if I make this recipe again.  Also, I didn't use the maple syrup because I don't like to drink super sweet drinks.",

I cut the recipe in half and combined the maple syrup and apple cider in a glass pyrex dish and microwaved it for 1 minute. I couldn't understand the benefit of lugging out the slow cooker and waiting 20 minutes for it to warm up. Then I just took a pat of butter topped the drink with it and sprinkled in allspice nutmeg and a heavy dash of cinnamon. Yum yum yum.",
