The only thing this needs is more eggplant (1/4 pound for 4 servings is not nearly enough - I used 1/2 pound) and it definitely needs salt in the actual dish, and not just in the soaking water for the eggplant. I ended up using about 3/4 to 1 teaspoon of salt. The rest of the seasonings are perfect. This will definitely be great for my low carb days, however I did end up eating it with a tiny bit of rice and it was delicious!",
