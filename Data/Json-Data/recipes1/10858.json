I used chicken stock left out the water and thickened the celery butter and onion mixture with a couple extra tablespoons of flour. I added two extra potatoes and used about two and a half cups of whipping cream instead of the half and half. Seasonings I used were Worcestershire sauce instead of the soy sauce a little chopped fresh basil additional Old Bay and a dash of cayenne pepper. The result was fantastic; thick and creamy everything a good \"Ball-mer\" Cream of Crab soup should be!",

The taste is passable but with other recipes not half as running I wold avoid this one. Texture is very important in crab soup and this recipe has almost none. If you decide to make it the actual cooking time will be 2-3 times longer than the recipe calls for while you are trying to reduce all that water. Then things get overcooked pot boils over etc. This is one to avoid.",

Instead of the chicken broth soup base water I just use a big box of low sodium chicken broth to make it easier. I also add two cans of chopped clams. Drain one and use the clam juice from the other. This adds great flavor and more salt. Red potatoes and red onions make the soup more colorful. Steam your own crab legs and use the time the potatoes are cooking to de-shell the meat. It makes for much better flavor and bigger chunks of crab in the soup than if you use canned crab.",

I continued making it but later I added a lot of cornstarch and water to thicken up the soup. It turned into a thick chowder that was really very good. It took constant stirring while I was adding the thickeners so that took a lot of time. Since I don't know what \"chicken base\" is I added 3-4 cubes of chicken bouillion. I figured it was close enough. It really turned out tasty. It was my very first \"seafood\" dish and my family and friends gave it a \"10\"!!",
