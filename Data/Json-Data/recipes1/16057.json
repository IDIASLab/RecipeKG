I did end up replacing a few things based on what I had on hand.  Lacking bacon, I browned up a couple of spicy beef sausages (diced) and a bit of ground beef to make it a little more dynamic.  I also added in some diced green pepper and went with white instead of brown on the rice (a preference thing).  I used dry peas that I soaked and cooked beforehand and skipped on the tomato, and only used the cheese as a topping (which ended up getting mixed in anyway).  It struck me as a sort of a down-home Southern style jambalaya.  It's definitely going on the menu again!",

I didn't have any instant brown rice so I used regular brown rice instead. We live at high altitude so I planned a longer cook time and actually ended up letting it simmer on very low heat for a good hour and a half (I added liquid a few times when it started sticking)...I added the tomatoes and black eyed peas after the rice was cooked and then the whole mixture continued to cook for probably half an hour. I added the cheese (used marble jack & cheddar) at the very end after turning off the heat as directed. Anyway it turned out with a wonderfully creamy texture and delicious flavor. Will definitely make this again.",
