The varied textures of the soft pasta with the crispy bread crumb topping are also nice. I added some freshly cracked pepper and paprika on top of the pasta prior to covering the dish with the remainder of the cheese and bread crumbs. I also used a bit more cheese and doubled the amount of bread crumbs. Still the dish did not turn out as cheesy as I would have preferred. I could not find shredded sharp white cheddar cheese so I bought blocks and shredded them myself. I would suggest adding a dash of salt to the recipe to bring out the flavors. Overall the family seemed to have enjoyed the recipe. Nevertheless they all agree it could have been creamier/cheesier.",
