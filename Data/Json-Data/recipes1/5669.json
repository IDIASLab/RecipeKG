Instead I pureed two medium tomatoes to replace the canned sauce and left off the Worcestershire sauce altogether. I used one stalk of celery two small carrots half and onion half a bell pepper. I seasoned with 1/2 teasp. sea salt and a palm full of parsley with a squeeze of lemon. I also used thinly sliced lemon on top of the fish while baking. It came out supremo!! It's nice to be able to convert a recipe to something all natural and his one was easily converted.",
