I sprayed a cookie sheet w/non-fat cooking spray prior to placing the beans on top.  And I used egg substitute instead of one egg.  Our whole family enjoyed them!  I'll def make them again & prob will make a large batch so I can freeze some.  Thanks for sharing this!",

My only changes - I did not cook the beans first left out the chili powder used fresh bread crumbs and added salt - you really do need some salt. I also sprinkled them with shredded Parmesan before I served them. The bread crumbs make a light crispy crust - much better than just flour - and although I liked the fresh bread crumbs I used I will try Panko next time. I made fresh buttermilk dressing for a dip and added horseradish to mine.",
