I used regular packaged egg noodles rather than frozen, which turned out great, and I believe required less cooking time.  I recommend adding a bit of fresh cracked black pepper, it really enhanced the flavor considerably.  The only semi-complaint about this recipe is that it does not \"keep\" or reheat very well at all, but with food this flavorful, if you have a hungry family to feed, leftovers will not be an issue.",

My changes: To reduce sodium and fat used 2 (10.75 oz.) cans Campbells Healthy Request Cream of Chicken and 1 (10.75 oz.) can Campbells Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom. Used Swansens Natural goodness chicken broth. Used Reame's noodles- the 12 oz. packages really soak up the broth so added a 4th can of chicken broth. Added freshly ground black pepper although white would be better.",

I had not noticed your own review and revision of this meal, however, until just now.  I was going to say that dried, packaged egg noodles are not the way to go but you have already corrected it with saying we need frozen egg noodles and that is very important.  I also needed more soup so they really should change this recipe as it is printed.  I just printed it out without noticing your adjustments and they are very necessary.  I needed it creamier, also, but will just adjust everything next time I make it.  I will also cut back on the amount of noodles used.  This was a bit much as this amount feeds much more than six, more like 8 to 10.  But it was wonderfully easy and very delicious flavor.  My entire family really liked it but we ran short on the \"juice\", as my little ones call it.",
