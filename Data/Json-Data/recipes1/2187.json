I changed the cake up by using pineapple cake mix instead of yellow cake mix.  I also used coconut creme pudding mix instead of vanilla pudding mix.  Also, the recipes calls for only half the cake batter to be used.  I really agree with this.  Don't use all the cake batter, because I think it would take away from the flavor of the cake.  Soooo good!  I can't stop eating it.  I was going to take it to work to share with everyone, but I think this one is staying with me.",
