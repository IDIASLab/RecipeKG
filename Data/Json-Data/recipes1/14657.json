In fact, he loved it so much he asked me to make the same curry the following day but with chicken.  I did and that was also wonderful! Another reason I love this recipe because shrimp is rather expensive so you can easily substitute this with chicken.  We wnjoy it with Paratha's(Indian flat bread).  I followed the recipe exactly except omitted the curry leaves but the Garam Masala is a must at the end.  The extra flavor after the seasoning makes a big difference in the authentic taste.(in my opinion)  Thanks for the wonderful recipe! This will be a regular dish in our home. ",

Next time I'd use just a pound of shrimp - it's also pretty expensive and I like a more equal tomato-to-shrimp ratio. This dish could hold it's own if it were served as one of three or four for a meal. Given the amount of fluid in the dish you'll want to add extra pepper if you like it hot.",

With the understanding that curry leaves and curry powder are not the same thing, I still substituted \u00bd tsp of curry powder for the curry leaves. This cook is on a budget, so I always do what\u2019s most economical, especially if I believe I can still get a good flavor. And a good flavor I did get! I also used 1tbsp of minced garlic and 1 tsp of ginger for the garlic paste as other reviewers did. I used \u00bc cup of coconut milk instead of water.  Used a can of diced tomatoes that I mostly drained instead of fresh tomato. I\u2019m glad I did not drain the can well, because I needed the liquid to make more of the sauce\u2026which tasted great over rice. Added some celery and red bell pepper in with the onion.  I served this over plain white rice and it was delish. One thing to note: this dish is not spicy as written. Anyone can enjoy it! It was perfect to me because I didn\u2019t want it spicy, but if you are looking for a spicier dish, just adjust the chili powder.",
