The only difference is that in that cookbook, they also add 1/2 cup of orange juice (and 1/2 tsp. of EACH orange and lemon zest, instead of just the 1 tsp. lemon zest).  It is called citrus chiffon pie and has been my husband' favorite for 20 years. I use a regular pie crust as I find the the graham is too heavy (in texture and taste) for this sort of fluffy pie... and yes I have used the premade kind of crust when I am lazy...which is more often than not!   I also cut the 1/2 sugar to 1/3 when you whip the whites to keep it sort of tart (the addition of orange isn't as sour).  The orange + the lemon give it a very good flavor. Way better than lemon meringue with that pesky, squeaky meringue on top.  I almost always use fresh lemon and orange juice, but have used the bottled kind and it is still good (just skip zest). I try to stick with organic if  using zest, though.",

I made my own graham cracker crust subbing applesauce for part of the butter so the crust texture was slightly different than a typical graham cracker crust...I think it actually worked better with the lightness of the filling this way and it was healthier as well. I made the filling exactly as written and it turned out absolutely perfect...the texture was light creamy and oh so yummy. There was the perfect amount of lemon juice; it gave it a nice tart light lemon flavor not overpowering but perfect. This is going to be my favorite dessert for Spring...I have a feeling I'll be making it again...and again and again...Thanks so much for sharing this one! It is a keeper!",

I will definitely be whipping this up again it really together well and had a nice creamy texture i might add a 1/2 tsp of lemon extract to rev the lemon up a little and am wondering if next time to make it in a 10inch springform since it slices so wonderfully and makes quite a large quantity of filling",

I finally added a little corn starch and beat it with electric mixer while over double boiler. Also unlike impatient me you must let it cool pretty well before adding the whites else it all gets a bit runny. After cooling in fridge for awhile was ok. I did make a gluten-free pie crust. Think I agree with other reviewer & will make whites into soft peaks instead of stiff. I do love the lemon so will try again (& again!!:)",
