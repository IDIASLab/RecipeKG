I will admit the batter is a bit more slack than a lot of people are used to.  Use a 1-ounce metal cookie scooper and you will have no problem with the dough.  Use a fork dipped in water to make the criss-cross design.  I did refrigerate some of the dough after scooping it and I found that it is actually easier to get a more uniform, pretty criss-cross design if you do it straight from the bowl without chilling.  The chilled dough did work okay, but it did crack on the sides and I had to push the sides together to make a uniform circle.  Also, check you oven temperature.  You cannot go by the time given.  Everyone's oven is different.  I baked mine at 350 degrees for 11 minutes and they were underdone and delicate/broke apart.  But, I baked a second batch for 16 minutes and they are perfect.  They don't fall apart and are still soft in the center and crisp on the edges with nice color.  I bake professionally for an upscale private club and none of our recipes have time listed.  You have to be able to tell when it's done by how it looks and feels.  Baking can be tempermental.  Mixing methods, ingredients, environment, humidity, and a whole host of other things affect your recipe.  The same recipe can come out differently every time if you don't pay attention to things like the weather, brands, heavy footfalls, etc.",

I've never had a peanut butter cookie so wonderful, and everyone in my family thought they were absolutely the best ever. When I was making them, I was a bit worried at first, because the batter looked quite soupy - almost like a pure, creamy peanut butter - But dont worry, they turn out! Also, I accidently really burnt the bottom of my first batch. It worked best for me to put them on the top shelf in the oven, and to take them out at 7 minutes and 45 seconds (the bottom edge looks slightly brown - but don't wait for the top to brown too much or the bottom will burn). They are a bit crumbly at first, so you may not think they are done. But once they cool, trust me! You'll be amazed. MMMM. 10 stars. Oh- Also, don't half the recipe, You'll be sorry you did. Make the entire amount called for in the recipe. :)",

Skip the milk...not needed, and I also added a little more flour (1/4 C). Good consistency to roll into balls, then flatten with fork. Try to stay away from dipping the fork in flour first - doesn't help much, and adds unnecessary flour. If your fork sticks to the dough - you probably need to add a LITTLE more flour. If you've added the extra flour - and want to keep your cookies chewy, then take them out of the oven a 1-2 minutes early - then before they completely cool, place them in an air-tight container.  \r\n",

I actually improved on it by adding about 3 small bags of Reese's Pieces to the dough, and instead of flattening with a fork, I flattened them with the bottom of a glass dipped in flour.  Suprisingly, the Reese's Pieces held their shape.  Oh so good!  If you love PB the way my husband does, you must try this recipe.  Definately a keeper!!!",

I like cookies a little sweeter; adding 1/8 cup extra granulated sugar will make them sweeter and just a tad bit crisper. I tried several different baking pans. They came out perfectly on heavy shiny stainless steel sheets. I made them bigger than the dinky tablespoon drop called for in the recipe and baked for 15 mins. Those who are finding them undercooked are probably using insulated baking sheets. Those who are burning the bottoms too easily are probably using the regular nonstick pans you find everywhere. It's all about the sheets. You might also try moving the pan nearer the top of the oven and baking a little longer. The dough is really sticky; chilling helps a little. I didn't add more flour but just settled for irregular edges.",
