It is just the right amount of sweetness topped with whipped cream.  I did adjust the recipe as follows:  I tripled the amount of lime and doubled the amount of lemon juice.\n\nFor some real decadence, I whipped heavy cream with a little sugar added into a beautiful topping and covered the entire pie top and garnished with a few lemon and lime slices dipped in granulated sugar before placing it in the refrigerator.  Yummy!\n\nTip:  Make the filling according to the recipe and then adjust filling ingredients to taste, i.e. taste it and then add a little more juice if you want.  Even with my adjustments, the filling was firm after chilled in refrigerator.",
