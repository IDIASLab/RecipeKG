I only wish a quantity could have been suggested for the chopped walnuts; I used 1/2 cup and we all enjoyed them but more might have been nice too. Additionally the recipe could have mentioned whether the dough needed to rest in the fridge a while before rolling out and filling or whether you were supposed to proceed immediately to rolling out the cookies after initially mixing it; I decided to proceed immediately to kneading and rolling it out but maybe I'll try resting the dough after mixing next time to see if it could imrpove the recipe. The bottom line is that the cookies are not too sweet but perfect for enjoying with coffee either after dinner or first thing in the morning! =o)",

However after having made these cookies I fell absolutely in love with them! The recipe is perfect (the dough is absolutely beautiful and is easy to work with) the crust is flavorful crumbly but soft the filling is just sweet enough and the nuts add another texture dimension. The recipe makes a bunch and after 5 days I only have a couple of cookies left (keep in mind this is just 4 people eating) they are that good! I would definitely recommend this recipe to everyone even those who have never heard of these before. They are absolutely amazing with milk! These keep better out in the air instead of in an airtight container since in a container they get a little soggy because of the filling.",

After you have spread the filling on the dough use the saran wrap to fold the dough over. Just lift by two corners fold and then peel off the wrap. Do the same for the second fold. To get the log on the cookie sheet put the cookie sheet on the counter next to the log bunch the saran wrap under the log on the side next to the cookie sheet ease the saran wrap and the log over onto the cookie sheet and roll it off the saran wrap. This works beautifully. I got a decent-tasting cookie but I had never had these before and didn't know what to expect. The directions bewildered me in a few places. I may try these again now that I have done a trial run.",

My mother had requested this recipe but wasn't quite sure how they would come out because the cookie she typically had was filled with prunes and cherries. She actually likes these cookies better because they are not as sweet! We are from Rhode Island also so maybe that is why my mother requested the recipe! (We now live in FL) Came out great and will definitely be on my cookie trays this holiday! One thing I would like to add the dough tends to be very sticky! It was a lot easier once I dusted my hands with flour! I was a bit unsure of how it would come out at first but very pleased!",
