Since even though it looks awesome with the angel food cake sliced like this, by the time you take out two or three slices out it is a mess so instead I use the trifle bowl and cube up the angel food cake then layer the cake and pudding mix. It is much easier to serve that way and everybody loves it.Huge hit and everybody wants it for the family get togethers.",

Very light tasting and, if you use light whipped topping and reduced sugar pudding, it is a sin-free treat!  I'm a trifle fan so I followed the trifle reviewer's suggestions and then layered 1/2 each of the cake cubes, pineapple/pdg/topping mixture, and then strawberries before repeating the layers again. Then to finish it off and make it look fabulous, I used an additional 1 cup of whipped topping and plopped it on top, decorating with halved large strawberries. Delish!!",
