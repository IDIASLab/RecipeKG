I added 1 1/2 cups of currants.  And instead of the cream cheese frosting, I glazed it when cooled with a simple glaze (1 cup powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 2 tablespoons milk, and 2 teaspoons vanilla).  I made it in a 9x13 pan instead of layers and it came out beautifully.  I had to bake it longer (I think about 55 minutes).  It was a fantastic recipe.  Thanks Suzzane!",
