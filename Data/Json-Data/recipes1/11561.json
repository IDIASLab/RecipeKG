I don't think I've had that since my kids were still at home, YEARS ago. I do like Dijon mustard, however, so I mixed it in a bowl with the cheese and a little milk and microwaved it, making a creamy cheese sauce with a little Dijon tang that I drizzled over the cooked broccoli.  Great memories of kid-friendly meals and good old-fashioned comfort food, updated with a Dijon twist.",

Everyone is able to adjust or add to their own taste buds and preferences, and I totally agree with Chef Clare, Please try and understand what you are talking about before you berate someones recipe, because you used substitutions or didn't make it properly....  Food and its preparation is an art and talent that not everyone has, but does have the capability of learning.  An experience.  Too many cooks spoil the recipe of origin.  Make a new recipe of your own already..... Good recipe....Thanks.",

                "reviewBody": "I guesstimated the cheese and cut it into bite sized chunks let it sit out until room temperature. Be careful cooking this in the microwave one minute on high could burn it easily. I did the cheese first for thirty seconds then stirred it and added a good splash of milk and a spoonful of Dijon mustard and stirred it in real good then nuked again for thirty seconds. I continued to add a little Dijon until it reached the taste I wanted I never came to the full amount the recipe calls for so I'd suggest add and taste since Dijon can over power if you add too much. This was a very easy topping for steamed broccoli and my family said to make it again. I love Velveeta on broccoli and the added tang of the Dijon was a very nice touch. The milk helps thin it a bit so it pours nicely over your vegetables and keeps it from hardening up too quick when cooling off.",
