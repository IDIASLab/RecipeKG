For those who think this soup weak, bland, or with non-mixing veggies... this is a traditional Finnish soup made with what is on hand.  It is served as a started for a long summer meal that usually includes -after- steamed potatoes with marinated herrings of various styles, smoked fishes, salads, and the like.  It is a bland soup, no chicken stock or anything, but using, as KEY factor, all FRESH vegetables.  True baby carrots, not shaved ones, fresh peas that we shell, cauliflower or broccoli, and young potatoes wit barely any skin on them.  What is delicious about it is the sheer wonder of the flavors of every vegetable.  If you do not use fresh, do not make this.  It just won't work.",

I did make some (significant) changes to the recipe: First off the recipe calls for 6 cups of green onions but I think it means 6 green onions - that's what I used. Second I added baby spinach and 1/2 a cauliflower. I also used about twice as much water as called for (in general use enough to cover your vegetables) and the texture/flavor were still perfect. For seasoning I used 1/4 tsp of black pepper and a 1/4 tsp of white pepper as well as some garlic powder. I also highly recommend using fresh baby dill (I was out so I used dried dill) in the soup and garnishing each bowl with it. Delicious!",
