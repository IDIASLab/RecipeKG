I used half of a 3 c. flour recipe for bread machine pizza dough rather than the the prepared, refrigerated crust. For added flavor, I seasoned the chicken with salt,pepper,and a little garlic powder and sauteed them in olive oil.  I lightly brushed the crust with olive oil before topping with the other ingredients, added sliced, fresh mushrooms, and drizzled about 1 T. of olive oil over the top before baking. This was a fun twist on the traditional pie. I enjoyed making it and enjoyed eating it even more!",

I think the key here is: 1)Use a good thick ranch dressing and rather than measuring it I just spread it on like I would pizza sauce; 2) A thick pizza crust is key couldn't see this on a thin crust at all; 3) Make sure your chicken is seasoned how you like it or it will be bland. Another tip is use lots of chicken mine seemed to disappear when the cheese melted so I'm going to use more next time. I used the canned tomatoes that were tiny chopped and seasoned and it worked great. I added chopped bacon pieces to half and it was good also. I think I'll try salsa next time. I've also made this with the chicken sauteed in BBQ sauce first which was a nice change but not as good as the original.",

When I make this pizza I buy the Boboli regular pizza crust and add use whatever veggies I have on hand. It's also great with a fresh salad on the side.
