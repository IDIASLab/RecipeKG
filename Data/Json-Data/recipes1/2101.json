                "reviewBody": "Excellent recipe. I found it useful to triple the amount of vanilla extract in the cookie recipe. Also instead of using the toffee baking bits substitute this recipe for real English Toffee. Needed: 1 cup sugar 1 stick butter (not margarine) 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1 greased cookie sheet (one with sides) Prepare by setting a few kitchen towels in the freezer to protect your frozen food from the hot cookie sheet that will come later. Combine all ingedients in saucepan. Heat slowly at low gradually increaing the heat until the sugar liquifies. Stir continuously with a wooden spoon. Gently increase the heat (a little at a time) while stirring. When you reach between medium low and medium you will notice the mixture starting to brown. Keep stirring. When it reaches a dark golden brown pour onto the greased cookie sheet. Set the cookie sheet on top of the towels in the freezer to cool. When thorougly cool to the touch remove from freezer and break apart (I use a mallot- anything heavy will do- you can even use your hands). Set aside and use in place of the toffee bits in the cookies. Be aware that when the cookies bake this toffee may run and coat the bottom of the cookies. This makes the cookies quite delicious- almost like a candy/ cookie hybrid. Enjoy.",

Very chocolatey thin and crispy almost like a brownie/toffee cookie brittle only not quite that crunchy. I like my cookies a little thicker so I'd like to play around with different cookie sheets or maybe lose the parchment paper I used this time. It all really does make a difference! I used Heath Bits and chopped pecans which both truly make this cookie special. Just a suggestion but save your precious rum for another use as you can't taste it at all anyway - and no need to double up on the vanilla as I noticed some reviewers have.",

First of all double this recipe....you will thank yourself you did. I used 3 to 4 Tbls. of Kahlua which helped the stiff dough then added a cup of semi sweet choc. chips and coarsely chopped pecans because I had no almonds. I also used a larger scoop (2 TBLS. capacity). I baked these on my baking stone which turns out a much better cookie because they don't spread out they bake up and leave a nice thicker cookie.( you will need to adjust your baking time when using a stone). I always bake extra and freeze in a ziplock for later. I give a BIG THANKS! for this recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "I was so disappointed in these cookies!! I followed the recipe but the cookies completely flattened in the oven regardless of how long I baked them. They stuck to the baking sheet and were hard to scrape off. After I scraped them off I crumbled the cookies into small bits and served it over ice cream. I give the recipe 3 stars because the crumbs were delicious even though they didn't form real cookies. I won't use this recipe again.",
