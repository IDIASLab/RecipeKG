I went to the store to buy eggs for this thing and figured hey I'll just get the jumbo size (the idea being that bigger is naturally better). Then I proceeded to construct the souffle following the directions to the letter. As it was baking I finally got around to reading other people's reviews of it. Oh a lot of people like it. But everyone who did changed the recipe. \"Six jumbo eggs were all I needed. Heck four or five would suit you just fine.\" As I'm reading through these the thought staring me in the face is \"My souffle is going to suck.\" As serendipity would have it it did not in fact suck. It was actually quite good. My company was pleased with it. I have seen others here say that it was too gooey or some such. I did not find that to be the case. It was warm and soft for breakfast. Later in the day we ate it cold and it was great---very much like a cheese danish. How versatile! From breakfast to dessert. And the moral of the story is: Leap before you look. Thank you.",

I started the dish out with a thick french bread and then I coated the bread in sugar and cinnamon before pouring any of the cream cheese mixture on top. I used six eggs and 3/4 cup of syrup with a couple handfuls of brown sugar and a couple of teaspoons of cinnamon and nutmeg. I cooked this casserole at 350 for forty-five minutes. When I removed it from the oven I drizzled syrup all over it and then allowed it to cool for five minutes. I then took a sifter and shook powdered sugar all over the top. The extra sugar and syrup allowed it to acheive a very moist consistency and almost the entire dish was gobbled up in a matter of minutes. It is the perfect dish for a potluck birthday or shower. I highly reccomend this!",
