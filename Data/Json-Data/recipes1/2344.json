Use frozen or almost frozen lard, butter, and/or shortening as your fat and ice water, and then chill the dough well before rolling.   Process the dough as little as possible and use only the amount of water needed to allow YOU to form it into a ball, not the machine.",

Light, flaky, delicious.\n\nI cut up the fats into cubes and then tossed them in the flour and froze the entire thing for maximum coldness (and to make sure the fats were evenly distributed).  I also added the water one TBSP at a time, dribbling slowly and stopping the processor to mix after each.\n\nI have a feeling pie crust can be very hard to work with, so I poured my mixture into a bowl and used saran wrap to bring the mixture into a ball (no bits escaped or stuck to my hands).\n\nAfter colding it up for an hour,I put down wax paper on the table and covered the ball with waxed paper and pulled my rolling pin out of the fridge and had ZERO problems rolling out a nice, thin pie crust.  I think I would have had problems though w/o the wax paper, but it made it easy to roll w/o breaks, stuck bits and super easy to transfer to the pie pan.\n\nWhen I made a lattice crust, I put the rolled out dough back in the fridge for an hour before cutting and it too came out amazing.\n\nI made a pumpkin pie and and an apple pie w/ lattice crust (my first pie baking experience ever) and my guests seriously thought they were bakery purchased b/c they looked so professional and tasted like a dream.",

I put the flour, salt, and cubed fats into a bowl and put it in the freezer for a couple of hours while I took care of other stuff. When it came out of the food Processor, I put into a bowl lined with plastic wrap (idea from another reviewer, thanks!) and formed it into a ball and into the fridge for about an hour. Rolled it out between two sheets of wax paper. Easiest pie crust I've worked with but you need to keep it very cold. **UPDATE** I made this pie crust again today but didn't bake it. I just put the flour, salt, and fats into a zip lock bag and put several into the freezer. This being the beginning of the \"pie\" season, all I have to do now is get the frozen ingredients out of the freezer and throw it into the food processor! Almost an \"instant\" pie crust! Just can't say enough good things about this recipe!",
