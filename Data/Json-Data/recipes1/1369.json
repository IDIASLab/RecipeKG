First I added 1/2 cup of heavy cream for a moisture texture I used VERY ripe bananas and used 3/4 cup of walnuts. I also mixed the dry ingredients and the \"wet\" ingredients seperately before blending them and and carefully added walnuts last. Also my secret....SHHH!...after the bread has cooled completely I wrapped it up in plastic wrap and let it sit (to allow flavors to blend)then served it the next day. YUMMY!",

Cooked it for exactly an hour, and the result was even better the second time around. The bread had a mouthwatering aroma, which filled up our home.",

The taste was good but the texture was lacking the quality I was looking for. It's just not my mom's recipe. It's light and fluffy and if that's what you want this is the recipe for you but I wanted heavier and with a darker color and texture (and more banana flavor). I think beating the eggs first and adding the banana to the liquid then blending the dry ingredients in would be better for texture as well. All in all a nice light snacking loaf but not what I had in mind.",
