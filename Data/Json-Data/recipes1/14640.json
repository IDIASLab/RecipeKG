Last time I made it I used the normal nonfat Publix yogurt but think I may try the thicker Greek style next time for a little more body. I also would experiment with upping it to one and a half or even two peppers since the feta is a strong taste that though delicious seems to steal the show from the peppers. Highly recommended.",
