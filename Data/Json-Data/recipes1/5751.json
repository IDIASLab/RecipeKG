I mixed the rice wine vinegar and the soy sauce and added 1 1/2 tablespoons of brown sugar. We're very calorie conscious so instead of adding the oil to the dressing I grilled some diced tofu in one tablespoon of sesame oil. After the tofu was basically grilled I added some diced onions and added the mushrooms (I used button mushrooms which were good but next time I'll try to use shitakes). I grilled all of this together and then added the whole mixture to the dressing marinade and let the tofu and mushrooms soak up the flavor of the dressing. I then boiled up the pasta and added some bell peppers at the very end of the boiling time. After draining I mixed the pasta in with the dressing mixture and mixed it all up and let it sit for about 10 minutes for the flavors to absorb into the pasta. MMMMMMMMM...it was so good! So as you can see I didn't actually follow the recipe that much but what I made turned out really good.",

I just couldn't see boiling the cremini mushrooms so I sauteed the mushrooms and red pepper strips. Also garnished with sliced green onions instead of parsley (chopped peanuts would be yummy too). I do think that this needs more veggies (any kind that suits you) because 8-oz of capellini is a lot of pasta. The warm pasta was like a sponge and soaked up ALL of the dressing. The chilled leftover salad will need to have a little dressing added otherwise it's going to be too dry. Good noodle salad but I really can't say that there's anything to distinguish it from others that I've had. And that's not to say that we didn't enjoy it.",
