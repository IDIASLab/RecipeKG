This recipe is so good that when I make it people take credit and say they made it beause of all the compliments that it gets.  This recipe is also easy to make, which my kids can attest to, at 8 (boy) and 3(girl) they both run to the kitchen when I say I'm making lemon cake.  There is no comparison for this moist, fluffy cake, once you've made it once you'll keep making it.  Just a little clue to that, I made this cake for the first time in August and have made approximately 25 since then.  Sometimes 3 cakes at one time.  People have told me to stop teasing them with pieces and start making whole cakes when I share with them.  Thanks again.",

The family has given this an \"awesome\" rating, and insisted on it all summer long as the \"perfect light desert.  We had it the third night with crushed raspberries and a dollop of whipped cream for company, and the cake was still just perfect. Rave reviews from all.",
