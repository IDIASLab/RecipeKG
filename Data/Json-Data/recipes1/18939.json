It does need to be made AT LEAST an hour before serving so that the cream layer can set up.  Otherwise, your pieces will not cut nicely.  My pie set for an hour and a half and I could not get a pretty piece of pie.  After the pie was in the refrigerator all night, the cream cheese layer had time to set properly and the pieces cut and served very nicely.  With strawberries just starting to appear in our groceries, I know I will be making this one again.  I will plan on making early in the morning, or refrigerate overnight before serving.",

I needed to regroup and could not make the cheesecake I had planned to make. So this recipe looked like something that I could adapt using the spread. It worked. I used 2 tubs (8 oz) of the strawberry cream cheese spread added all the other ingredients except the vanilla and the cinnamon (I added a TBSP of Chambord) and made my own crust and glaze. All I can say is this recipe is a keeper. Even though I changed this recipe out of necessity I bet the original is delicious too. Thanks for the recipe Paniece.",

Hmmm... imagine that! I also made my own glaze and let it be a bit chunky. As a result, the strawberry topping turned out not quite as firm as I'd hoped, but that was no fault of this recipe. I'll just add a bit more cornstarch next time. The cream filling was divine, and as the name of the recipe indicates, this pie truly is \"to die for\". I'm making another tomorrow to take to a benefit dinner!",

I halved the cinnamon and used about half of the glaze. The pie was finished in a flash. It traveled well to a Memorial Day picnic and cut cleanly after only a couple of hours of chilling.
