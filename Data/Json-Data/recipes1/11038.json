No need to measure just saute the squash in butter as needed add salt pepper and dill to your taste. I cooked this however at medium-high heat not the medium-low as the recipe directs. Saute as long as necessary to achieve a crisp-tender doneness not till it's soggy and mushy which can easily happen with summer squash. Great fresh flavors with just a few simple ingredients - what's not to like?",

I cook this in layers....first carrots cut on the diagonal then yellow squash zucchini maybe some green peppers and then mushrooms shaking dill between each layer. Drizzle some olive oil on top lots of garlic and about a tablespoon of butter. Cover tightly and just let it cook very slowly around 20 mins or so depending on the amount you're cooking and how tender you like your vegies. No need to stir. We also like to put it on top of our fresh pasta. So good!!!",
