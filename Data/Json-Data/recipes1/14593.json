NO, you do not need to boil the ravioli first, but I let it thaw for a while before baking (about an hour), but you don't have to do this if you don't have time.  Here's what else I changed.  Add 1 diced onion and 1 tsp garlic to the beef.  When adding the sauce add 1 small can sliced mushrooms.  Use 26 oz jar spagetti sauce (I used Ragu No sugar added Basil Tomato) and WELL DRAINED diced tomatoes.  This gave me plenty of sauce for the layering.  Use the entire package of ravioli and a 9x13 dish.  no need to grease/oil the dish.  after the first layer of cheese I added small dollops of ricotta over entire pan.  Also all cheese measurements need to be increased since using more ravioli and larger pan.  Ended with sauce layer.  Bake 30 min with foil on then decrease heat to 350, remove foil and bake an extra 15 minutes.  After removing from oven and sprinkling with parmesan, allow the dish to cool for 5-10 minutes.  This will make slicing/serving easier.",

                "reviewBody": "Oh. My. Gosh. This was soooo GOOD!!! For all you food snobs out there, us \"working class\" folks don't have time to make everything from scratch. Shame on you for looking down at us or snubbing a good recipe due to it being \"semi-homade\" (geezsh)! Because my hubby & I work long hours, we rarely have time to make elaborate meals during the week. When planning this week's meals, I stumbled upon LUVINMYHUBBY's recipe & IMMEDIATELY knew I HAD to give it a try. In order to spend less time in the kitchen tonight, I browned my beef / onion (I added a small diced onion when browning my beef) on Sunday. I then mixed in my sauce / tomatoes (Hunt's balsamic, EVOO & basil flavored) & threw in my (covered) Tupperware Mix-N-Stor pitcher. Tonight, all I had to do was assemble everything & pop in the oven. NOTE: I started to layer 1/2 of my raviolis in my 8 x 8 in. baking dish & by the 2nd (final) layer, I had used the entire bag! That, subbing meat filled ravioli for the cheese variety (hubby's request), adding an onion (as mentioned previously) & not using any Parm (personal preference) were my only changes. There are TWO important things to note here. First, you DO NOT need to boil your ravioli (that would negate the simplicity of the entire dish). If the recipe submitter thought you should, she would have instructed to do so. Second, as is, this takes more like 40 min. to heat thru. Served w/ a bagged salad mix & garlic bread, this was a FANTASTIC and EASY meal! Thanks for sharing! :-)",
