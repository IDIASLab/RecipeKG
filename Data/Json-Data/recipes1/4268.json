After reading the reviews stating that the ricotta layer falls to the bottom of the cake I decided to plan for it by using a bundt pan instead of a 9\" x 13\" pan and made half the ricotta mixture (and added almond extract to the cake mix as well as 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond extract to the ricotta mixture) spooning it all over the top of the cake mixture. Baked as directed in the recipe inverted onto a plate after it had cooled a bit and then sifted powdered sugar over the top after it had cooled completely. It makes a gorgeous cake 1/2 moist yellow cake on bottom and 1/2 delicious ricotta layer on top. Yum!",

Recently I miss placed my recipe for it and while trying to replace it came upon this version and as far as i can tell it's identical to my previous one. However since it had been awhile since i last made this i wasnt thinking and of course didnt properly read the recipe so i made the mistake of mixing all the ingredients at the same time... i was worried but decided to try it... it didnt turn out too bad and i would recommend this method for anyone who wants to avoid the \"wet cake\" texture. My mistake turned out a cake that was slightly more of a sponge consistency but still retained the ricotta flavor I perferr the traditional method but this \"oops\" was also good... and saved quite a few steps all ingredients mixed in one bowl and then into the baking dish... alot less clean up too!",

The cake came out great but I learned the hard way that you have to place a cookie sheet underneath the cake pan to catch the overflow that caused a brief smoke party in my oven. After scrubbing out the bottom of the stove the cake baking was back on track. The cake was getting dark after about 45 minutes so I turned temp down to 305 degrees for 30 minutes and back up to listed temp for another 5 minutes. I tried it warm (cooling for 15 minutes) and it was great. I actually iced the cake with store bought icing and placed in fridge and it was even better today. I would definitely make again.",
