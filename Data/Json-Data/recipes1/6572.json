Instead of using water, we used chicken stock \u2013 & doubled all amounts to use as a main course vs. side dish.  We also used frozen baby peas (I added them a couple of minutes before serving),  This is one of the few times we used butter \u2013 & it made a huge difference in the taste outcome.  As others have said, the red pepper flakes really compliment this dish -  as does a good shave (or 2) of fresh parmesan cheese over the top.  Quick, easy & tasty! ",
