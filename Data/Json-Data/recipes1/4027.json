                "reviewBody": "I thought this recipe produced great gingerbread cookies - and the quantity was large enough to take care of all my cookie-gifts for friends.  I added loads of flour, though - maybe even a whole cup - the recipe should call for more flour, not make it optional.  I used a bit of lemon zest since I didn't have extract on hand.  And I substituted maple syrup for half the molasses, which probably improved the flavor, judging from others' reviews.  Enjoy these cookies!  Even with the extra flour they are soft, good for cutting with cookie cutters, and delicious.  With many baked goods, it's important to mix all your dry ingredients separately from your wet ingredients, THEN add them together and mix JUST enough to blend.  Overbeating after they are combined WILL result in a cardboard-like cookie, so be careful.  Hope this helps!",
