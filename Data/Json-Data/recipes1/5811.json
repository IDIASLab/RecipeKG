I was skeptical about the instructions regarding not greasing the baking pan but had absolutely NO problem getting the cake out of the glass baking dish. The butter sauce was a huge disappointment (hence the 4 out of 5 stars). The corn starch turned a creamy sauce into a gloppy lumpy coagulated mess. Reheating did not thin it and it was SO unattractive on top of the otherwise delicious cake.",
