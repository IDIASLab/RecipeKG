Served with white rice, crusty bread and salad.  Wonderful meal and very quick.   I plan to use for a large family meal as it would be easy to pre-cook everything ahead.  Just throw in the shrimp and reheat while preparing the rice.  Nice company meal. Thanks for the post.",

I added one chopped green bell pepper.  I used one 8 oz can of tomato paste, 1 14.5 oz can of stewed tomatoes and one 14.5 oz can of rotel.  I didn't really measure the spices.  Just dumped in cayenne and tabasco until it looked about right.  I let it cook in the slow cooker on low for 6 hours and then added the shrimp and let it cook another 2 hours.  It was perfect and pretty spicy.  Thanks Pamela, I've been looking for some recipes that would taste like dishes my boyfriend used to eat in Louisiana.",

Pour it over a bed of freshly made white rice and some hot buttered cornbread and you have yourself a meal made in cajun heaven!",
