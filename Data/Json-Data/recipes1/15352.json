                "reviewBody": "When my Grandfather passed on, I became THE cookie baker and candy maker of my entire extended family. Which means... I bake and ship a LOT of cookies.  I began using this recipe several years ago and it has become my absolute favorite. These cookies are easy to make, freeze wonderfully (both prior to baking and after), and are GREAT for shipping as gifts.    The only changes I make to the basic recipe is that I use regular (always good quality) salted butter, and freshly ground sea salt, in place of table salt, which makes a subtle but amazing difference in taste.  When baking for home, I wrap stacks of cookies with aluminum foil and store in the freezer, taking them out as needed. this way they stay super fresh and yummy!  If I am baking for Christmas gifts, I add dried cranberries, and after they cool, I either drizzle with melted chocolate, and/or dip half of the cookie in white chocolate. Everyone RAVES about them!   Other ingredients I add at times are mini chocolate chips, raisins and spices.   A little tip to those who mention issues with their cookies turning out greasy... Try refrigerating the cookie dough for a couple of hours before baking. After baking, allow them to cool on plain brown paper (I save all of my paper grocery bags for this purpose).  The paper will absorb any excess fat in the cookies, and it's a great way to recycle! :o)",
