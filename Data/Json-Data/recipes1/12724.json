It needs cream and ghee and I plan to find a recipe that's more authentic. If you do make this make sure to use paneer... it's easy to make on your own with some whole milk.

I used some tomato paste instead of a whole tomato and I used chopped frozen spinach instead of fresh.  Since the spinach was already chopped I didn't process this in a blender.  I had to use Ricotta instead of Paneer but it wasn't difficult to cook. You put it in a skillet on a very low heat, leave it alone until it browns on the bottom and has cooked out a lot of the liquid.  The liquid will dissipate faster if you score the cheese in lines so there is a place for the liquid to bubble up through.  Once it is browned on the bottom cut between the scores and carefully flip over.  It will brown more quickly on the second side.  Remove from heat and let it cool completely then cut into cubes.  I use a good quality non-stick skillet without using any oil.  It worked out well.  This recipe is so good.  It is going to be one of my staples.  Thank you for submitting this!",
