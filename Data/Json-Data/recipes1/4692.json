Also increase the grated cheese to 16 oz. of Cheddar/Monteray Blend.  I mix all ingredients together and then layer with the Corn Tortiallas (usually takes more than 6) and alternate layers ending with a layer of cheese.  Be sure to add cheese to your soup/chicken/sour cream/green chile mixture.  No need for chicken stock either.  This is great just served with a salad.  Amazing!",
