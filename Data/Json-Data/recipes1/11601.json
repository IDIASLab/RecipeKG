(even my husband who is insulted by muffins in general loved them)I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used vanilla soy milk instead of cream since that is what I had on hand, and I added a little bit more milk until the texture seemed right. I was a little worried because of the bad reviews here, but I remembered reading in \"The Joy of Coking\",that different flours have different properties depending on moisture content and age and how they are stored:some flour will need more milk, and some will need less, so use your best judgement when adding liquid to avoid hard muffins!\nThanks for sharing a super recipe!!",

All other ingredients were just as the recipe calls for.  I was concerned at first because the batter was very, very thick...but they turned out wonderful.

I doubled the batch and didn't have enough cream cheese so I also used non fat yogurt the only flavor I had was Cream Brule and also didn't have cream so used non fat milk and used 1/4 cup less flour. I also used brown sugar instead of white. They turned out so soft and light not cake like. Thanks for putting the recipe here for me to try!! I will make them all the time now!!",
