I did skip the first step of salting the cabbage though and just omitted salt from the dish entirely (salt draws out moisture from the cabbage and then if it sits too long the dressing becomes watery). I halved the recipe as I was only cooking for 3 people and followed the recipe exactly with one exception; I added about 1 tbsp of honey to the dressing mixture. The end result was a very interesting tasting coleslaw and we will likely make it again.",
