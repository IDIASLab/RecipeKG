I needed a brownie recipe that includes water because my class experiment is replacing water with a different ingredient (a nutraceutical) to add healthy benefits to the food. THis recipe was EXCELLENT for what i needed it for. They came out moist and cakey (I took them out 5-10 min early each time). I have made them at least once or twice each week for this class and they are very consistent. However they are VERY dark chocolate. Anyone in my class that likes dark chocolate LOVED this recipe. If you are a more milk chocolate person use semi-sweet chocolate instead and I think you'll enjoy the recipe more. Its deffinitely for Dark chocolate lovers.",
