To cut the fat/calories using half (or more) the amount fat free evaporated milk and replacing the other half (or more) with organic chicken broth is really good too. I do saute a couple cloves of minced garlic in with the onion and I'll shake in a little red pepper flake.",

I also used skim milk and it thickened up nicely. Aside from the entire stick of butter or margarine and the entire pound of sausage this is a pretty healthy meal you know not counting these two variables...lol. Next time I'll omit the salt as the sausage makes it salty enough and I'll try a reduced fat smoked sausage. With all that said this is one cheap delicious meal.",

Being that New Orleans leads the title, I had to add a pinch of crushed red pepper, a dash of cayenne, and a heaping tsp. of Creole seasoning, Tony Chachere's original since my husband brought it home from New Orleans recently.  I read reviews and also added 4 cloves of garlic since I doubled, and a 12 ounce bag of jumbo cooked, peeled and deveined shrimp.  I threw in uncooked unpeeled potatoes and the frozen shrimp and frozen corn and simmered it for 30 minutes and it was just perfect.  This one's a keeper!  ",
