I put the cauliflower in the processor and mashed well, then loosely mashed the potatoes separately adding butter, garlic, & sour cream.  Then I added the mashed cauliflower.  It was actually delicious.  My husband loves mashed potatoes and I don't think he would have known detected the difference if I hadn't told him.  Without the potatoes, I thought the mashed cauliflower texture was a little off-putting.  Since we don't really like the taste of cauliflower, I'm always looking for new ways to mask the taste because of the health benefits.  I will make this again.",
