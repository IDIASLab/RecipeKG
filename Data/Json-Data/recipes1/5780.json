My eggplant got cold waiting on the dressing to sit. (B) I nearly killed myself trying to fry the first batch of wet eggplant that needed to sit and drain--I know that is common sense but I was making several other dishes got carried away and was just going by what I read. I threw the rest in the oven and really couldn't tell the difference between the fried and the roasted. Despite all of that my anti-eggplant hubby ate this. My kids still refused but I still rate this a four just because I wasn't the only one enjoying eggplant this time. The directions are not very clear but the end result is good.",
