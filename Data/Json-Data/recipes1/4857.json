The name of the recipe is slightly deceptive -- usually wings have a dry quality to them, but these were stewy. I made a few modifications which made a big difference: add much more garlic (2 Tbsp minced), ginger (1 tbsp minced), hot sauce (sweet Korean red pepper paste, 1 Tbsp), 1 Tbsp brown sugar, 1 Tbsp vinegar, 1/2 cup chopped cilantro (coriander leaves). These had to cook way longer than 15 minutes for me, more like 40 minutes. Then, to dry them out, I placed them in 1 layer in a casserole dish and baked them at 200 for half an hour. Fantastic with steamed rice and broccoli  : )",
