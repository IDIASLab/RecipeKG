It does taste like apple pie. I read previous reviews about this recipe being too watery so I added a half of a tablespoon of minute tapioca to it (which I put in my regular apple pies). I also increased the number of crackers used to 30. Those changes gave the filling the texture of canned apple pie filling. I also believe that no apple pie is complete without some nutmeg so I added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. This recipe only got four stars because of the nutritional information. Regular apple pie is much more nutritious has one third the sodium (132mg vs 366) and about 200 calories less a slice. (255 vs 456 calories a slice) Not to mention the fact that apple pie has apples in it - which have a lot more health benefits than Ritz crackers. Needless to say although this recipe was really easy and it does taste like apple pie I won't make it again simply because of the nutritional information.",

The consistency (and flavor) of the filling is like watery applesauce. It's a fun thing to make - but I don't think I'll ever make it again. I mean WHY would you make MOCK apple pie? Who do you serve it to? I just wanted to see if this recipe worked and it did. If I were to make it again here's what I'd change: Add about 5 to 10 more crackers - this filling is really watery. And maybe add some cornstarch as well - 1 Tablespoon or more? Otherwise it's a fun little recipe but I'm sure your time in the kitchen is better spent on other things than making fake apple pie!",
