Hubby & son (both very picky) enjoyed it.  I used a 9\" frozen deep dish pie crust, and had just a little extra filling left, so I baked it separately in a small ramekin, and it was delicious, too.  I also added an extra egg since I had only lowfat buttermilk, and it set up perfectly.  Next time I would take it out of the oven when there is a small center of custard that still \"jiggles\", as it will firm up while cooling.  I am also planning to try it with lemon peel and juice, and once with coconut.  The flavor of the custard is wonderful.  We preferred it after it had chilled it in the fridge.  My first buttermilk pie experience, and I will make it regularly.  Thanks for a great recipe!",

I baked a second, to make sure it was not a fluke, and ended up hiding it in my bedroom so no one else could eat it!!!  This pie is fabulous!!!  I added the zest from one orange to the batter, and that just took it over the top!!  You gotta try this!!",

This recipe is rich & sweet. If that's not your type of pie this isn't your recipe. As is it is not \"eggy\" as some of the other recipes I had made. My household loves pie - & several mentioned that the flavor is slightly reminiscent of creme brulee'. I served this the first night slightly warm topped with a dollop of homemade whipped cream which was not too sweet. Lovely! Thank you for an excellent recipe.",
