Delicious but even using low-sodium soy sauce a bit salty for my gang.To combat saltiness after removing chops from marinade I brought it to a boil then added 1T brown sugar and 1T cornstarch.The result was a subtle sweet sauce to spoon over a moist tender and flavorful chop.This will be a keeper at our house.Thanks Kathy.",

I also reserved the marinade and after boiling it (so you wouldn't hear about us on the evening news) I poured it over the grilled chops that I had set on a bed of otherwise nearly tasteless bean sprouts. Rice would have worked too. The marinade ran over into our grilled zucchini which was fine with us. Yummm!",
