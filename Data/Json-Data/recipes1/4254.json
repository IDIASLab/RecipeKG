I reduced the sugars down to a little less than 1/2 cup each; added an extra Tbsp. cream a full cup of Pignoli (toasted in the oven for about 6-8 min at 175 C (350 F)) and a few drops of almond extract; also baked in pastry dough instead of a pie shell. I served this to guests - there were only 4 of us and it was gone by the end of the evening! Thanks for this simple divine recipe!",

The only change I made was toasting the nuts before putting them in the pie to make the flavor more powerful. Wait until completely cooled before cutting - although when you smell this baking you'll have a hard time waiting! Great recipe!",

It was very easy to make. Use butter and not margerine for the richer flavor. I used a full cup of pine nuts toasted them on a cookie sheet before using them in the pie which filled a regular 9 inch frozen pie crust. I brought two pies into work and they were gone in no time. Everyone wanted the recipe.",

I toasted my pine nuts first and also added about 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Next time I will try reducing the sugar b/c the sweetness almost overwhelmes the taste of the pignolis and I don't want to give up the chocolate! Great recipe!",
