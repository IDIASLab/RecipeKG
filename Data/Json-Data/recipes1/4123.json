The first time I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was way too oily way too salty and didn't have NEARLY enough basil flavor...and don't even get me started on the almost 45 grams of fat per serving!! So this time I omitted all of the butter used regular half and half instead of heavy cream cut the parmesan to 1/2 cup upped the pesto to 2/3 cup and added about 2 tablespoons of dried basil (I would have loved to use fresh basil but didn't have any:( - if using fresh you should use 1/3 cup). This brought the fat down to a mere 13 grams of fat per serving. That's something I can handle!! Others had mentioned the sauce being too thing when using half and half but mine was REALLY thick! The key may be to simmer it a bit longer on medium-low heat. Still needs more basil in my opinion but I think using fresh as opposed to dried would do the trick!!",

One thing I will point out is to be careful when adding the parmesan.  On my first try, my cream was too hot and it curdled.  The second try, I took it off the stove and added the cheese slowly - stirring constantly.  I also sauteed some mushrooms in fresh garlic and added them to the sauce along with two scallions and a diced tomato.  I used frozen cooked shrimp with tail off.  I defrosted them in the microwave and added them to the sauce.  Cooked until warm and served over fettucine.  It was delicious.  My neighbors were over and were VERY impressed.  Easy and elegant.  A new family favorite.  Thank you.",

I've been living in Italy for the last 20 years and in a fantastic restaurant in Milan a superb version of this treat is made.... instead of drowning the poor linguine in heavy cream, use two good dollops of mascarpone.  There's less fat in the end, the linguini don't have to swim and there's no real need for butter.  As a perfectionist, I cook the shrimp (scampi are even better) aside in a little olive oil, 2 whole cloves of garlic and a fourth cup of dry white wine for those 2 or 3 minutes necessary to make them succulent... then toss them into the mascarpone and linguini.  Hey folks, the pasta must not be soupy!  I just love this plate, you will too.",

A minute before adding the parmesean cheese, I also added 1/2 cup of chopped red peppers, 1/2 cup chopped green peppers, 2 chopped green onions and 1 cup fresh sliced mushrooms!  You can't get any better than that! Adds a more colorful presentation and at least you feel like your eating a little bit healthier (considering there is a 1/2 cup of butter and all that cream)!  Just the same, it's restraunt quality and will make over and over! Thank you for the GREAT receipe!!!!!",

This is my 1st rating and I couldnt resist rating this one...I did do a few things different - nothing drastic though....I added about 4 cloves of minces garlic to butter, used 1 c heavy cream and 1 c skim milk (for calories purposes), since I used only half of the alloted hesvy cream, I added a little corn starch to thicken just a bit though (about tbsp). I also used already cooked shrimp - the KEY to using these is to run them under water first to defrost them...THEN add then to sauce (wont make the sauce so thin) I put the whole thing over wheat pasta soo good! Hope these tips help others!",
