Use an instant read or candy thermometer and check that the liquid is at around 120\u00b0F-130\u00b0F for \"rapid rise\" active dry yeast 110\u00b0F-115\u00b0F for regular active dry yeast.",

They are not cake donuts and if they turn out like that, then you didn't make them correctly. I recommend microwaving the milk, butter & sugar one minute or until luke-warm to avoid killing the yeast when you add it to your dry ingredients. You may need to let the doughnuts rise longer than the recipe calls for. Also make sure that you are using good yeast that hasn't expired. It's all about the rise and that they are cooked properly. I recommend using a thermostat controlled deep fryer to accurately fry these doughnuts just a little bit past golden brown. Let them cool down before you coat them. They are excellent with glaze, powdered sugar & various flavors of cake icing.",

I also used a glaze of 3 cups powdered sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla, and 3-4 tablespoons milk.",

I used the suggestion of using confectioner sugar and milk to make an icing but I also used about half confectioner sugar half chocolate milk mix. I only wish I had waited until the doughnuts were cool before dipping them into the icing because the icing melted on them right away covering the overall doughnut rather than making a nice-looking icing. Overall very satisfying.",
