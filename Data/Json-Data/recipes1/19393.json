        "description": "These lemon curd tarts are a staple dessert at my tea parties. I can make them quickly without even measuring the ingredients using a pastry bag to fill the small shells. The crust remains crunchy for several hours, so I make them early the morning of the tea and then refrigerate them. I also serve these at wedding and baby showers. For variation, you can place 1/4 teaspoon raspberry spread underneath the lemon curd and garnish with a fresh raspberry, omitting the cinnamon. Another variation is to use lime curd instead of lemon, both of which can be found in the baking aisle of the grocery store.",

Also I hate fake whipped topping like cool whip so instead made homemade whipped cream with a little sugar in it. Lastly I left off the cinnamon and instead took equal parts lemon zest and sugar and mixed them together with a few... and i mean few drops of lemon juice and i sprinkled that on top of the whipped cream. This is the perfect balance of sweet and tart and not too much of either. This is a perfect light delicious spring or summertime dessert.",

After looking at three stores for lemon curd I finally made my own using 'Microwave Lemon Curd' from AR. It was a great recipe although I had to thicken to use in the phyllo shells. I made these for Easter and they were a hit. Paula thank you for this simple recipe. I already have 2 other occasions that I know I will be making these again.",
