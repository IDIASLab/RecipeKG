I chose to sear the meat then do cook the meat at the low temperature for a long time.  It turned out great.  Here is the information:  \n\nTime and Temperature\nThere are two ways you can roast it: \n\nAt a low temperature for a long time, or\nAt a high temperature for a shorter time. \n\nYour roast will shrink less if you cook it low and slow, but you won't get the same flavorful, well-browned exterior that a high roasting temperature gives you. \n\nIt's possible to combine the two methods by starting the roast at a high temperature to sear the outside of it, then turning down the oven after 30 to 45 minutes to finish the roasting. If roasting at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), the meat will take about 17 to 20 minutes per pound. If you start the roast at 450 degrees F (235 degrees C) for the first 30 minutes and then reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), allow about 13 to 15 minutes per pound. \n\nThe meat was tender and delicious.

I followed the directions exactly, only adjusting the time spent baking at 325 for my 7 1/2 pound prime rib.  Because of the relatively low cooking temperature in the end, I waited until the roast temped at 135 before I pulled it out.  After resting 20 minutes it was a perfect 145.  I'm still reeling from how good this turned out... better than ANY restaurant I've had it at!  \n\nP.S. I was worried that cooking at 500 was burning that yummy crust created by the garlic and thyme, but I kept faith and stuck with it and it turned out nice and crispy, not burned at all.",

Even though I cooked a 4.5 lb roast, I made the amount of garlic mixture called for in the recipe, which covered the fat very generously and produced a delicious crust. One reviewer mentioned their garlic was bitter. I imagine that the high initial temperature of 500 degrees scorched the garlic. I seared my roast at 460 for 12 minutes, and then since the fat seemed like it was on the verge of smoking, I turned the oven down to 400 for the last 8 minutes. I then roasted at 350 degrees rather than the 325 in the recipe, until my meat thermometer read 130 degrees. It was juicy with beautiful pink color in the center. Thanks Chen!",

Just the right proportion of ingredients.  The combination of the thyme and garlic gives a lovely flavor to the meat.  Had a 4# piece, so halved the recipe for the marinade and it was spot on.  Used kosher salt and ground the paste with my mortar and pestal.  Scored the fat and placed the marinade on top pressing down on the marinade to soak into the cuts.  Marinated this morning and placed in fridge, took out 1 hour before making.  Thanks for the recommendations of turning down oven; did at 450 for the 20minutes then proceeded. I did add some beef broth to the bits at the bottom of the pan and it made a lovely thick, rich, dark au jus.  I would love to use this on other cuts of beef using the same method.  thanks so much!",

I made this for 8 adults and it got rave reviews, my husband said it was the best he ever had. I was so nervous, I've been known to overcook many a roast, but not this one, it melted in your mouth. The only changes I made were like some of the other reviewers stated and I browned it at 460 for 12 min. and then another 8 at 400, reduced it to 325 and cooked for 20 min per pound. I took it out when the temp registered 125 (was getting nervous), and let it sit out for 20 min. It was definatly a perfect rare in the center and med-rare on the ends. Terrific! The only change for me would be maybe take it out when temp reached 130, because I like more med-rare to med. But trust me no one complained, it was high 5's all around.",
