Sometimes the simplest things in life turn out to be some of the best and this was no exception. There's nothing like a classic pb&j sandwich but once you get the peanut butter nice and melty and add some oohey gooey marshmallow cream - well you have yourself a nice little treat. If you love peanut butter and jelly sanwiches give this a try you'll be glad you did. Definitely have an ice cold glass of milk handy...",
