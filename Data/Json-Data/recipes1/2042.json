They are a cross between chocolate chip cookies and brownies. I can't stay out of them! Thanks for listing it. EDITED TO ADD: These cookies don't keep for too long so eat them within 2-3 days. I don't recommend freezing them because they really harden quickly once thawed (like in 1-2 days). They're awesome when fresh though!!!",

Would also be really good with some white chocolate chips I imagine and I think I'll try that next time. I didn't want to mess up another pan to melt the chocolate chips so I stuck them in the microwave on low power for a few minutes. Worked well just make sure to stir every 30 seconds or so they can burn as I learned from experience. I wonder if some of the reviewers aren't familiar with this type of cookie; several folks have mentioned that the powdered sugar left funny white spots on the cookies after baking. I've generally seen these called \"Chocolate Quakes\" and the idea is to have a white sugar-covered ball of dough which breaks open during baking to reveal the chocolate underneath.",

I was doubting that the cookies would flatten out so I baked one in a toaster oven and I was stunned at how the cookie turned out. This recipe is a keeper and it looks like I'll have to make more than 2 batches at a time:)",
