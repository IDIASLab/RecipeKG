I did modify the recipe a tiny bit...used self-rising flour added one cup cup of chocolate chips to the cookie dough and I decreased the cooking time to 9 minutes. Undercooking gives you a soft chewy texture which is what my family likes. This would be a good recipe to play around with. Adding coconut nuts vanilla chips or peanut butter chips etc. would produce interesting results. Thanks Nevena for your recipe.",

I thought the dough was terribly bland so after I baked about half the dough and tasted a cookie I ended up adding some cocoa powder to the rest of the batch (would have equaled about 3Tbsp for the whole batch) and that gave a lot more flavor. Still not great though. The texture was also a little bit on the dry side. I don't think I'll chance it again.",

I'm thinking of making a Halloween version using licorice to make spider legs just after I take them out of the oven. I did cook them around 9-10 minutes because we like soft cookies.",
