Try it, you will be amazed at the richness it adds. I also like to toast the French bread a bit before it goes onto the soup, the bread is less slimy soggy if it is toasted.",

My hubby and I use to have to go to one of our finer restaurants in town (that is not kid-friendly so we had to find a babysitter too) to get the best onion soup in town but thanks to Lori Levin, I can make it myself!  I sliced about 5 large onions and cooked them for about 40 minutes over med heat, stirring them once in a while.  Then I added 1 minced garlic clove in for about one minute before adding 1/2 cup white wine (a bit more than 2 tbsp!).  I let it cook until almost dry then I sprinkled the onions with flour and cooked that (while constantly stirring) for about 3 minutes.  Then I added 5 cans of beef broth and cooked for about 20 minutes.  I used grated Gruyere and this was absolutely the best french onion soup I have ever had and I can't believe I made it myself!!

The only changes/suggestions that I would make are to add a tablespoon of Worchester Sauce and use all butter instead of the olive oil. Make sure that you saute the onions well. (Also, make sure that you slice the onions into fairly wide slices, about 1/2-3/4\" wide.)  You don't want them burnt, but you do want them browned.  I use Campbell's Double-Rich Beef Consumme and 1/4 cup of Sherry.    For the cheese, I put a tablespoon of FRESH shredded Parmesan cheese on the bottom of the bowl, then ladle on the soup, then top with a large homemade crouton, then the swiss cheese, and another tablespoon of the fresh Parmesan.    For the croutons, take a large wine-glass and press into a slice of thick bread to get the perfect circle for your soup bowl.  Spread with butter and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Put in the oven at 250 for about 1/2 hour or until they are dried and crisp.",

I sauteed those in the onion and oil then threw it all in the crotch pot.  Oh and I used half of the full strength broth (10.75 oz Campbells), and half swanson, which is diluted.  And I added the Parmesan to the soup as it brewin'.  Thanks so much Lori, it IS great!",

The only thing I had trouble with was judging how much onion to use. I used two large white onions and found that to be perfect. I cooked the onions for a half hour before I added the broth and used the sherry which I think is necessary in making this. This recipe did not need any additional seasonings it's perfect as printed.I did use beef stock instead of broth though. The stock I used is Kitchen Basics and it is sold in a juice box like container. Using it will make any soup much better than canned broth! This recipe is a keeper thanks for sharing Lori!",

                "reviewBody": "I've been trying to perfect the onion soup for years, and this recipe served as a perfect base. I try onion soup every chance i get, and I still say mine is the best. This recipe is simple and delicious as is, but here are my tweaks to take it up a notch into perfect (or as close as i've come to date).\n1. Use 2 Large Yellow Onions/2 Lg Red Onions\n2. Use 1/2 the butter, that's simply too much\n3. Caramelize the onions. Naturally. Throw a couple pinches of salt during this process to help the onions sweat.\n4. Add 2 cloves minced garlic (w/ onions)\n5. Use FRESH THYME Bundle and Bay Leaves and add them WITH the onions.\n6. Use 1C Red Wine to deglaze onions. Bring to Boil then Down to simmer and add broth\n7. (Here's my magical twist). 6 Cups of Broth - 4 Beef, 2 Chicken (I use Better than Boullioun paste because it's not too salty and therefore I can control the salt)\n8. Add 2 tsp Worcestier Sauce (oh...this is key)\n9. Chunk and toast french Baguette before adding to soup\n10. Shredded GRUYERE Cheese. If you can't find Gruyere, 2 Provolone slices is fine..don't use Swiss. (still dash some parm/romano on there)\n\nVoila.",
