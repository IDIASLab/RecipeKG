                "reviewBody": "Sorry but I agree with DREAMERSG04 and Kathleen. This dish would make so much more sense separated on the plate as a poached chicken breast some sauteed mushrooms some fresh celery and some rice made with the curry/celery/chicken stock. Sour cream on the side a soup of your choice as a starter. It certainly needs more stock/liquid--the texture of the dish straight out of the oven was poor (dry and crusted on top). I also used less of the seasoning package and it still was quite salty. The taste was good to quite good but the presentation was poor. You couldn't quite tell what the dish was and the yellow cast from the curry gave it a kind of unhealthy yellow/grey cast. I did all the preparation the day before and the baking the next day as I ran out of time. Certainly most suitable for your family at home but I wouldn't take it to a party. Update: Sept 12 07: great news! I tried it as a 'skillet' dinner-- saute sliced onions on medium in a skillet and start rice in a saucepan. Add small cubed chicken pieces to skillet and cover with lid to keep the juices in. Add curry powder and celery (if using) white wine (if using) and stir often. When the rice is almost done add the mushrooms can of condensed soup and sour cream to skillet. Turn the rice into the skillet and gently stir to combine. Simmer about 10 minutes or until desired consistancy. Looks awesome tastes awesome and took only 45 minutes from start to finish. 10 out of 10!!",

This is what I did- I put 3 lbs. of chicken in the pan, added 1 cup water and 1 cup Gewurztraminer (white wine) along with the other spices and veggies- ended up with over 4 cups of stock after I strained and removed solids.  More than enough for this recipe, but you could probably add another cup or two because the stock is hella good.   I cooked the rice following the directions from the box, but instead of using water, used the stock.  Rice was killer by itself!  Sauteed mushrooms in butter, then added them to the rice, chicken, sour cream, and soup (I suppose you could add the celery and onions left from the stock, but they're mushy...I didn't).  Then cooked on 325 for 1 hour, covered in foil.  My wife and I gobbled this stuff up like it was going out of style!  Definitely recommend.",

My husband ate it five hours later and thought it was OK (3.5 stars). I took a bite then too and I have to admit it didn't taste as good to me either. So freshly prepared it's great but as leftovers it's a bit less than great. This is relevant because it makes a huge amount! Probably 6 - 8 servings. Small point: to make 12 oz of rice according to my package directions you need 4 cups of liquid (way more than the 2 allowed for in the recipe).",
