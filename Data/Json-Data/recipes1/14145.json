I took a batch to work last Friday and they were a huge hit.  I had lots of requests for the recipe.  Good thing I have internet access at work so that I could eailsy print the recipe.  \nHere are some of the tips that I handed out to my fellow co-workers....be sure to use rubber gloves when handling peppers.  Also, to reduce the \"pepper fumes\" in the air, fill your sink with water, float the peppers in the water.  Working with a sharp knife and a spoon, slice them in half length wise and use the spoon to scoop out the seeds and veins.  Do all of this under the water or you will cough hysterically!  I learned this from experience many years ago.  \nI also added about 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar and a few sliced green onions to my cream cheese stuffing mix.  \nMost people were surprised that these were actually very mild and quite tasty without a mouth of fire.  I suspose, if you wanted some heat you could leave the veins or add some of the seeds back to your stuffing mix.  \nENJOY :)",

It adds that background flavor that makes people wonder. Also, added cayenne for some extra heat to the sausage/cream cheese mixture.  My peppers were somewhat mild so this punched up the flavor a bit. I used a convection oven to bake the peppers and even that didn't crisp the bacon as much as I would have liked.  Next time I'll microwave the bacon slightly before I wrap the peppers.  Thanks for the recipe -- I'll make it again and again!",

I have not been able to make it in less than 60 minutes, so it is time consuming, but worth every second.  A few suggestions:  wear a mask while scrapping the peppers (after about 15 peppers, it has the effects of pepper spray); wear gloves if possible; I used reduced fat sausage and reduced fat cream cheese and it was still delicious; I precook the bacon in the microwave for about 45 seconds (for 8 pieces) to try to reduce the fat and ensure the bacon is not limp after baking.  Enjoy this wonderful recipe!",
