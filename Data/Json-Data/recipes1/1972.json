However, I thought the cinnamon taste was pretty much indiscernible, and the body of the muffins didn't taste very apple-y (the apple pieces were very good though). So I can see why so many others added lots more cinnamon and apples. If you want nice, mild-tasting and not heavy muffins, these are very good. If you're looking for a hearty, strong-flavored apple muffin, this recipe won't do.",

I do have a standard topping that I use with any fruit muffin and added to these muffins...and they were incredible! To make it...use...1 cup instant oats, 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon each of baking powder and baking soda and 1/2 cup melted butter and mix together until crumbly. Sprinkle this (there will be well more than enough) so...add lots..to the top of these muffins. As an added and amazing touch...I melted carmels with a little cream and did a drizzle of that on top of the crumb topping after they were cooled. Everyone that has had them today...are in sheer heaven!",

It may have been the apple juice in the recipe, but the muffin tasted so apple-y...I was in heaven because I love everything apple! I made a few changes in the recipe: I used 1 tablespoon of canola oil in place of the egg and used 1/3 cup of milk instead of the 1/3 cup of oil. I also left the skin on the apples; you can't tell the difference once the muffins are baked anyway. The end result was a soft, moist and fruity muffin.  This one is going in the favorite recipe drawer. I'll defintely make this one again...5 stars. Thanks SO much for posting!  ",

Its great for using in cakes and cupcakes as well!*)The muffins baked perfectly after 20 minutes, they weren't too sweet but still full of flavour and were a big success with my family! Thanks",
