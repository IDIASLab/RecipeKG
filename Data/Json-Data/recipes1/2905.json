But the cheese cloth had to be basted about every hour and I ended up taking it off and covering the turkey with foil for the last two hours of cooking. I found that the moistness of the turkey was not really that much different than what I usually get and most of the flavor was in the skin instead of in the meat. Maybe injecting the turkey would allow more of the flavor to come out. Probably won't do this recipe again but it was nice to try something different.",
