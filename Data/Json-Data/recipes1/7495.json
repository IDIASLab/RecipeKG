The balls really tastes like the coconut balls in Hungary (we are from Budapest so we know) and it is easy and quick to make. In Hungary they make these balls from crashed biscuit and sour cherry but the mashed potatoes and the lemon soaked raisins taste exactly the same. Unbelievable! I used vanilla extract instead of rum so my 1 year old boy could also enjoy. The other alteration I made to this recipe (to fit our taste better) is that I soaked the raisins longer in lemon vanilla (2 hours) and drained them before adding to the potato mix. Thus I left lemon juice out of the mixture (added 1/3 less sugar at the same time) which helped to keep a more solid consistency and resulted in a more coherent sweet taste. (The original recipe yields a bit \"piquant\" coconut balls as they are a bit sour.)",
