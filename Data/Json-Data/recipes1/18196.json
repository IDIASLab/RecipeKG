If I were to make this again, I would decrease some of the salt in the topping and add more sugar to both the pie filling and the topping as well.  I'd also give a more precise measurement for the lemon juice and only use 1 tbsp.",

First it was a crisp contest so I omited the crust. Due to no crust I baked it for 55 min, or until the topping was golden. I added a tablespoon of dark cocoa powder to the filling, and used 1.5 teaspoons almond extract in the filling. Then I sprinkled 1 big tablespoon of mini chocolate chips on it right out of the oven. The judge said that while she prefers tart crisps without anything but cherry flavor mine was just that good to get 1st anyway. 2nd, and 3rd were both tart and were delicious. This recipe has the perfect amounts of flour, oats, almonds, and butter and if you are new to crisps or pies you should watch the video.",

The almond crumble is crunchy and is the perfect complement to the soft cherries. I learned a tip from a French baker: if you want to add less sugar to a recipe you can reduce it by 30g without drastically changing the flavor. That's what I did and it was the perfect amount of sweetness since my cherries were already naturally sweet.",
