I also mixed diced green chiles in with that mixture in the pan and substituted pepper-jack and cheddar cheeses for the asiago....it was FABULOUS!!! I've already got a request to make it again next week!!",

Other than that I added more garlic than called for and used red green and orange bell peppers. Great recipe just use different cheese:-)",

I did make a few changes: Someone had previously mentioned using Zatarains dirty rice and I happened to have a Zatarains Jambalaya rice mix at home so I used that. I added two cloves of minced garlic and sauteed it along with the meat and onion. Rather than using garlic salt I threw in garlic powder and a few dashes of salt. (I may be weird but I'm not fond of garlic salt.) Also I used the reduced fat Jimmy Dean sausage and had great results. I will ABSOLUTELY make this again. My partner loved it as well although she did mention she'd like to see fewer tomatoes in it next time.",

Because everything is cooked in advance and I like super-soft peppers I think I'll pre-bake just the pepper shells for half an hour and then add the meat and cheese until melted and toasty. Oh I also used andouille instead of regular pork sausage - perfect spice for us. Thanks so much for sharing!",
