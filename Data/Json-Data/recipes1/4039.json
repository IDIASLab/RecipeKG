This was very light and refreshing and I'm sure would work with other kinds of jello as well. It's a lot more similar to a lemon meringe than a cheesecake tho (I don't really get that comparison). My main issue with this recipe is that the \"chill before serving is rather vague\"...perhaps it should be common sense but I made this about 6 hours (in the freezer) before serving and it still hadn't set...I recommend giving yourself 12-24 hours in the fridge to allow the right consistency.",

I pressed out all the juice from the pineapple and stirred that into the whipped mixture.( I wish I added the zest from a lemon. I ll do that next time) I had enough whipped pie batter leftover from filling the two 9 pie crusts to fill 12 tart shells as well!. Allow the maraschino cherries to drain in a sieve before you use them to garnish the pie or else the juice will bleed/tint your pie pink. This would be a very nice dessert to take on a picnic or BBQ in the summer. It s very light and refreshing. This pie needs to be chilled overnight or put in the freezer. It will not be frozen but will set firmer as I think the fridge isn t cold enough. THX",

I love pineapple but I think I would like this dish better without it--kind of a sweet taste from the pineapple then tart taste from the lemons. I also don't like the texture that much. So I'll probably make it again--very easy and quick--but without the pineapple and see if I like it that way better. Thanks for the recipe.",
