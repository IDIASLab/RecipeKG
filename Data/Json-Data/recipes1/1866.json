The only change that I made to the recipe was to use real maple syrup instead of imitation and to use about 1 1/2 tablespoons instead of 1 teaspoon. I also made the maple butter frosting and it really made the cake something special. I have already had requests to make it for several parties in the near future and given the response I will definitely oblige!",

On its own it is fairly flavorless and a tad dry even tho' I watched the baking time carefully. A solution might be to add another 1/4 cup sugar or maybe another egg - or swap out the milk for buttermilk or sour cream. Or use half butter half shortening. Any or all of these suggestions might help but you shouldn't have to toy around with this type of recipe. It should already be trustworthy. I am in no hurry to make this again or even have another piece. (I didn't even finish the one I cut for myself) My 3-star rating is generous.",

I also used egg beaters and light butter to make it a little healthier. it was light and delicious and I frosted it the next day with the cream cheese maple icing on here. as long as it was well-covered it stayed absolutely fine (this is a week later) so maybe that was a fluke for some people.
