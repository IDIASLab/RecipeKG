But the overall taste was wonderful. I didn't have the orange peel but the sauce was still really good. Be sure to baste the dumplings every so often. Also the vanilla ice cream with it is definitely a must. I am eager to try filling the apples with a different fruit in place of blueberries for fun next time. It would taste great with raspberries or any berry really.",
