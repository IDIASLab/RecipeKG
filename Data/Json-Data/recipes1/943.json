I thought putting them in a pie with something else would help so I tried this. It is outstanding! It tastes like neither mulberries or rhubarb and we loved it. Dicing the rhubarb is a great improvement over cutting it in big chunks the way people seem to do with strawberry rhubarb pie. I did cut the sugar back to 3/4 c because 1 1/2 c seemed like too much for four cups of fruit. I also added a few dashes of salt. Be prepared to spend a long time removing stems from your mulberries! I wasn't sure if it would be worthwhile but this is probably the best pie I have ever made.",

Easily the best pie I've ever had and my family loves pie. It was just the right combination of tangy and sweet and my friends raved about it. I think this will be a regular on the menu as long as I can get hold of mulberries and rhubarb. I did tweak it slightly. I used 2.5 cups of mulberries and about 4 cups of diced rhubarb (had a lot on hand) only 3/4 cup of brown sugar and about 1/3 cup of whole wheat flour to the filling. I let it sit for about 3 hours before filling and baking the pie. I used store bough crusts this time but it still turned out amazing. I would gladly recommend this recipe and will be making it throughout the season! Thanks so much!",
