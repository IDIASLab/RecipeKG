Secondly I did not grill the shrimp but as another reviewer advised sauteed it with some EVOO garlic and about 1/4 cup of the juice from the salsa (there is a lot so it won't affect the taste of the salsa at all). Then served the shrimp with the salsa to top it off. It turned out absolutely fantastic!!;O) Definately a keeper!!",

It is not so good left over...all the citrus makes the pasta and shrimp mushy so make only as much as you will use. Also I used a whole pineapple and all the juices from cutting it. I added the pineapple juice with the other juices. Over all a great salad and I will make it again.",
