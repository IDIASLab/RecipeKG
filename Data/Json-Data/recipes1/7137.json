I added 2 onions 1 more stalk of celery garlic Sherry Liquid Smoke beef bouillon homemade vegatable stock Italian seasoning and fresh parsley (instead of dried). I sauteed 1 onion and 3 T. chopped garlic with the meat drained off the fat saving about 3 T. to saute the vegatables. Sauteed 2 stalks celery cabbage carrots and potatoes another onion and added 3 T. of Liquid Smoke. While that was cooking I added 1 c. Sherry 4 T. beef bouillon granules 1 T. Italian Seasoning 1/2 c. fresh parsley corn barley mushrooms tomatoes 6 c. homemade vegatable stock water salt & pepper to the hamburger mix. After vegatables were sauteed I added everything together in one large pot. After this came to a boil I let it simmer for 1 1/2 hours while the bread finished rising and baking. Very flavorful this way and comforting.",
