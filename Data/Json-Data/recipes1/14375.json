Please understand that the clarified butter called for is easy to make, and also imperitive to the success of the instructions of this recipe. You can make clarified butter by melting twice the butter called for in the microwave, pop it in the fridge, and in about an hour (do this ahead of time), you can take it out, pull off the solid top, and you have clarified butter liquid in the cup. Remeasure for an accurate amount. If the recipe burned to fast before, or you had to bake after frying, give it another try. You won't be disappointed. Thanks a lot PGraff, you're a great cook!",

I just use 1T unsalted butter, 1T olive oil.  I do know that this is always hands down the best dish I make and people can't stop eating even if they're \"bird eaters.\"  I just use egg with a splash of milk to coat this (instead of butter) before adding the pecan breading because it sticks better.  I brown each side for 2 minutes, which is perfect, and then stick in the oven at 375 for 15 min.  This is always moist.  I use all of the butter stated for the sauce b/c this helps simmer down the taste of alcohol.  I use Jim Beam and on accident one time, I used a Rum.  Still edible though (thank goodness, considering this is what I use any time new guests come over).  This goes perfect with a strawberry salad and for the best dressing in the world, try the one on \"Strawberry Romaine Salad I.\"  I've never tasted anything so perfect!",

To solve the problem of the chicken burning easily, I use a little butter and olive olive oil to increase the smoke point.

Then it fell off and it also burned during cooking.  \nThe flavor is FANTASTIC and I am going to make again, but this time I will NOT mix butter into pecan and breadcrumbs and coat chicken with egg then roll in mixture.  Also, I will fry both sides and then bake until done.  Very tasty sauce!  Mmmmm!\nUPDATED:  I changed to five stars with this version.  Do not add butter to pecan mixture, keep dry.  Dip chicken in egg and then roll in pecan mixture, will stick nicely.  Then bake in glass dish and pour sauce over.  Very tasty and a little healthier!!",

A few suggestions- Ask your butcher to pound out the chicken a little for you- it cooks a little faster and more evenly. Keep a cookie sheet sprayed with nonstick cooking spray in a 350 oven so as you finish cooking each piece of chicken you can keep it warm while you finish cooking the other pieces because they won't all fit in one pan. I followed the directions exactly for the sauce but don't know why next time I couldn't just melt the butter seperately then stir it into the rest of the sauce.

Was out of butter so used \"tub\" margarine. It still turned out wonderful! Flavorful juicy (not dry like most of my chicken dishes!) my family loved it. Suggestions: Make sure the pecans are chopped/ground very fine so they will stick. Make the sauce ahead of time (it seemed to increase in flavor when we reheated it later for leftovers). The pecan breading will burn quickly so try browning it very fast over high heat in a bit of vegetable oil just a couple of minutes per side then place on a cookie sheet (spray with Pam first) in a 350 oven for 15 minutes or so to finish cooking. I served it with a simple rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. This is a delicious dish quick and easy and a new family favorite. Sophisticated enough for company too!",

                "reviewBody": "I had to make several changes because 1) I don't like using white bread crumbs 2) the crumbs don't stick to a plain chicken breast 3) the cooking method caused the crumbs to brown more quickly than the chicken can cook and 4) the chicken was bland while the sauce was too strong and fatty. Here are my healthier changes: 1) season the chicken with salt & pepper reserve 1/3 C chicken and brown the rest in a skillet 2) process 1/3 C chicken & egg white with a little milk until mayo-like. Coat chicken with this mixture before coating with crumbs. Sounds gross but I learned this from Michel Richard's cookbook and you can't tell after it's cooked. Plus crumbs adhere to this much better than eggwash or buttermilk and its nearly fat free. 3) use homemade crumbs from whole wheat bread (medium sized for more crunchiness). No need to add butter to crumb mixture. 4) drizzle with EVOO and oven bake for 20 min 5) for sauce use 1/4 C heavy cream instead of 3/4 C butter. This mellows the strong taste of the sauce while cutting out a lot of fat.",

I pound chicken breasts thin and coat with buttermilk and then 50-50 ratio of bread crumbs and pecans (bread crumb mixture will get soggy so reserve some to the side for last couple of chicken breasts). Saute in approx. 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp olive oil (to keep butter from burning at high heat-quicker than clarifying butter). For the kids in my family I serve with honey dijon sauce (dijon mayo and honey) or ranch dressing. I also add a little paprika garlic powder and kosher salt to breading mixture. My husband hates nuts but loves this recipe-I just chop pecans really fine. Definitely 5 star!!!",

At first I thought I had burned the chicken when I turned it over but it was the brown sugar that had caramelized. I would venture to say that this is the best chicken recipe that I've found and I will be making this one again and again.",
