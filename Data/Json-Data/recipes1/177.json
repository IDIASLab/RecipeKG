I also made a pan with the same swirls and substituted coconut  for the nuts for my allergic husband. They are really good.  Just a couple of suggestions;   You need to line your pan with foil that overlaps the edges, so that you can just lift it out once it has cooled.  Also grease your foil.  The cooktime is way off.  18-20 minutes max on these bars and they are chewy and rich.  I just love them.",

These are a huge family favorite on the 4th of July.  Thank you.",

It was easy to make and only took a few minutes, but I didn't care for the final product.  When I read that they were chewy I was expecting the texture of a fresh baked Toll House cookie, but that isn't the case.  These are chewy the way caramel is chewy.  The taste wasn't bad, just not what I was hoping for.  To sum it up, my expert cookie tasters (my kids) didn't even ask for seconds.",

I used a mix of chocolate chips and mini m&m baking pieces but a bit more than a cup will be sufficient next time. I omitted the nuts for a change of pace. I actually made two batches of these one to take to a friend who had surgery. They turned out well nice layer of crisp very thin on top and then nice and soft and chewy and filled with chocolate what could be better? The kids love them too. I gave them 4 stars and will use this recipe instead of my old stand-by for congo bars Thanx",

I used a 9x13 pan and I highly recommend underbaking just slightly so they stay soft and chewy.  I didn't have nuts and didn't miss them.  I used a combo of chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and white chocolate chips because I was trying to use up leftover bags.  I will definitely make again!!!",
