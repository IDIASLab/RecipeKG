For the \"stuffing\" I used cream cheese Rotel with green chilies minced homegrown garlic and shredded Italiano mixed cheese (Parmesan Asiago and Romano). I also seasoned the zucchini halves with salt and pepper before stuffing them. I use a charcoal grill so got it up to 450 degrees and put them directly on the grill for about 15 minutes. I made four medium zucchini for four people and we ate every single bit of them and probably could have had more! I made grilled shrimp and pineapple skewers to go along with them and it was a perfect summer dinner. Thanks for the recipe!",

Also I cut it the wrong direction (oye vey) so had to brush the sauce on (useing up some creamy pesto sauce) then fill the last 5 minutes (with tomato/cheese).
