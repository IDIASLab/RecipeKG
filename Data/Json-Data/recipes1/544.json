Next time I will double the cream cheese & whipped topping mixture so it is thicker and can stand up to that \"steal the show\" crust! I made my own blueberry pie topping from freshly-picked blueberries (boiled/dissolved 1 c. sugar & 1/2 c. water then added 3 c. blueberries 1 T. lemon juice and 1/4 t. cinnamon and cooked for several minutes. Thickened with cornstarch dissolved in 1-2 T. of cold water) and got many compliments on a delicious dessert.",
