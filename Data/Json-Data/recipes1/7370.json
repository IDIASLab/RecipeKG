I didn't have quite enough cream cheese so I made up the difference with low fat sour cream however I did double the potatoes but nothing else. I didn't see the need for the flour or for the onion ONLY because I felt that the fried onions would work even better not only as the topping but mixed in as well and it did. I added garlic and onion powders to the mix too. This was awesome girl and I thank you for submitting your recipe!",

I used leftover Yukon Gold mashed potatoes from Sunday dinner and following the advice from another reviewer doubled everything except the cheese (I used Neufchatel) onion and egg. I didn't have fresh onion so I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of onion powder which worked great because my kids don't like to see onion. I also didn't put the french onions on the top. I did forget the flour but I don't know that it made a difference. I also added about 1/3 c real bacon chunks. I know that made a difference! My 13-year-old son had thirds! I think it would be good with green onions or a touch of parsley to add color.",
