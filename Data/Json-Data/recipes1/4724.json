Next time, I'll skip the salt, halve the onion mix, and use low sodium mushroom soup if it exists.  My neighbor made a similar dish for me once, and I was trying to find it on my own.  Her chicken was extremely tender and not salty...looks like I just need to get the recipe from her directly.  Sorry...has potential, just too darn salty.",

What I did was to forget the browning, just added the chicken directly to pan,put in the oven,cook till slightly browned,drain the fat,add sour cream mixture,do not add salt,the soup mix has enough.return to oven,  I added garlic powder and touch more black pepper. Then I added milk to thin the sauce and served over fluffy white basamati rice, just add a side of green beans,or broccoli a tossed salad, and you have dinner in no time at all.",
