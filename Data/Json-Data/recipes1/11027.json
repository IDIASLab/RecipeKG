I used candied pecans (just on the top) sugar free chocolate pudding and fat free whipped topping which I just piped on the top. I used the directions on the pudding box for making a pie because I wanted it to be firmer. I allowed it to refrigerate several hours and that seemed to do the trick. We all enjoyed this 5 minute-to-make pie and I will be using this recipe again when I need a quick easy satisfying dessert! Thanks for sharing.:)",
