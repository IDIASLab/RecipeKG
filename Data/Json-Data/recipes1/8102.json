It's just the right amount of tartness using 1/2 cup but if you're looking for a more intense lime taste you can you might try using 3/4 cup instead. I used fresh key limes (if you don't have a garlic press to juice the limes the next best way to juice them would be to cut them in half and score the halves - take a teaspoon and insert it into the scored half and twist the teaspoon as you squeeze the lime - this helps ensure you get all the juice possible) - just run the juice through a fine mesh drainer to remove seeds and any pulp. As one reviewer mentioned the texture is a little bit grainy- most people wouldn't notice it hence another reviewer disagreeing and noting it was smooth and creamy. I could tell it slightly off in the texture but it doesn't affect the flavor. I used a graham cracker crust (store bought because I was all out of graham crackers)... I prefer a graham cracker crust versus a regular pie crust for this particular pie. However if you do use a graham cracker crust the upper part of the crust will overcook due to the length of time and temperature the pie must cook for.",

This turned out pretty good but I think that I like key lime pies made with egg yolks instead of the whole egg. I think the mouth feel is different, it's creamier. There's nothing wrong with this recipe, it's a personal preferance. The kids and I liked it, though. I served it with whipped cream on top.

I was disappointed and wasn't about to got BACK to the store. I almost gave up but discovered a package of low-fat cream cheese and decided to wing it. I combined the can of condensed milk a little more than 1/2 cup of juice 1 egg and half the packet of cream cheese...and it worked! It's a much more creamy pie but very tasty too...so if you're ever in a egg pinch or prefer a more creamy pie this might be one solution for you. (p.s. You have to let it cool completely before it sets.)",

I am at a loss to understand the comments that say the texture is grainy. Eggs, milk, limes hardly add up to grainy.  \nGettting the juice from the lime is as easy as putting the lime in the microwave for a 15 seconds and slicing it open and squeeze.  I second the lady that uses the microfile.  They are wonderful for any grating - limes, lemons, cheese.  Worth every penny you pay for them.\nMy Husband gives this key lime pie 9 out of 10 and he is the expert  LOL.\n\nHappy Christmas to all.",
