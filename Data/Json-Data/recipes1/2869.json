I use Land O Lakes. I use 8oz. of cream cheese, not 3oz. 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup of unsalted butter, 1 8oz cream cheese, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 3 1/2 cup flour and 1 tsp baking powder. I've never had problems getting these to roll out after chilling the appropriate amount of time. They bake easy and taste wonderful. I use royal icing to decorate. They make great gifts as long as I can get them out of the house before everyone in my family eats them!!",

The dough just had to sit out for about 15 minutes to take the chill off and you really have to work fast because the dough warms quickly. I cut my cookies thicker because....we'll, it's a personal choice so I got much less than 72 cookies. No problem because this recipe is great! 375* for nine minutes was the perfect time for me. NOTE: If you wait a couple minutes after you take the cookies out of the oven and just let them cool on the cookie sheet, they'll slide right off onto your spatula.",

Here are some sugar cookie rolling tips to make the most of your dough, as well as make things go a little easier and faster for you (hopefully!), because these are as time consuming as you'll let them be!  So worth it though!:  -I divide the ENTIRE batch into about 5 pieces, and leave them covered in plastic wrap or in plastic baggies in the fridge, removing one at a time to roll out.   -Once I've used my cookie cutters on one as much as I can, I roll up the scraps, put them back into the plasic wrap/baggie, and into the fridge it goes.  I do not re-roll it, even if I'm working fast and the dough's still cold.   I then move onto the next ball of dough in the fridge, and so on, rotating in the same order I started.  I do this until all of the dough is gone.  -Everything gets rolled out onto a surface dusted with a 50/50 mixture of powdered sugar and flour.  The powdered sugar helps keep the dough from getting tough, instead of using just flour alone. I hope all this helped some of you! Enjoy and have fun decorating!!",
