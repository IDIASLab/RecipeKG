I didn't want the peanut butter to be too over powering. Then on the top of the pie, after I sprinkled the (Oreo) cookies on top.(I covered the top with Oreo cookie chunks.) I also drizzled it with chocolate syrup. It turned out better than I had thought it would. I will be making this again real soon. Thank you for the recipe.",

It turned out wonderfully and my husband said he liked it \"too much!\"  Because there is no butter/baking to hold the Oreo crust together, it kindof crumbled when serving but I just gathered up the crumbs and scattered them on top of the dessert.  Sweet taste is the reason for eating a dessert!  Great recipe.",
