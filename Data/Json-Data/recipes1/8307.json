Chili powder 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard 1/2 tsp garlic powder dash hot pepper sauce and 1 Tablespoon Vinegar--because I didnt' want a sauce with a strong Ketchup flavor. It was delicious!",

The upgrades I incorporated were 2 tbls of sour cream as it made the meat much moister, 1 (28 oz) bottle of Heintz Tobasco Ketcup (for a little more zip) and a few splashes of Franks Red Hot Origianl sauce. I then added a few more splashes of red tobasco sauce and a little bit of water in the slow cooker so as to take away some of the \"ketchupy\" taste while maintaining a moist sauce.
