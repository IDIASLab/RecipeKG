A sprinkling of chopped cilantro and chunks of avocado on top make a great presentation and dish.\nUPDATE: I've tried this a couple times using Rotel's tomatoes with lime & cilantro ...... then 1/2 green pepper, a few slices of jalapeno's chopped fine, and a couple tablespoons of chopped cilantro.\nBut ..... again .... the KEY is to get the scallops into the lime juice the day before!!!",
