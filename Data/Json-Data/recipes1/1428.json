I used 1/2 tsp almond 1/2 tsp lemon and 1 tsp vanilla. The flavor was perfect as was everything about the cake. I looked at all the popular pound cake recipes and I'm glad I chose this one. Won't ever look for another one. Btw it took around 50-55 minutes in my oven and it was not underdone at all.",

To serve we topped each fabulous little cake with strawberries and whipped cream. Our guests loved them some referred to them as \"doughnuts \" and more than a few asked for the recipe.

The cake was DELICIOUSLY moist the texture was awesome! I topped it with some homemade glaze...just used powdered sugar milk melted butter and vanilla. Oh and I think the trick to not burning the outside before it's done is to put your oven rack directly in the middle of your oven. That worked for me anyway. The cake was beautiful tasted awesome and impressed the inlaws as well as my pound cake-phobic hubby.:-) He's not usually a fan of them but enjoyed this cake.",
