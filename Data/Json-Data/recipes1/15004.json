I cook till my onions start to turn clear.  My whole family loves it, including the kids. Not to runny for us at all.",

He did sub sour cream for the milk and the gravy had a nice texture I think milk would have made the gravy to runny which is why I rated it 4 stars. The only issue here is that is so \"package\" (but that is really to be expected given the ingredients) tasting but other than that it was a nice hot dinner and he didn't spend a ton of time in the kitchen.",
