I love how many different \"weird\" sandwiches were family favorites and considered totally normal! Ours was this one with a slice or two of american cheese added. Use real mayonnaise and super-crisp iceberg lettuce. For some reason this has always appealed to me on the kind of not-so-good mornings that sometimes come after really really good nights out. I think it's the combination of the rich salty mayo and cheese the sweet peanut butter and the crisp lettuce. Just seems to hit all the right spots.",
