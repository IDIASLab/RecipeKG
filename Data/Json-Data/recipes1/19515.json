These frogs were perfect and my daughter was so proud! Instead of sprinkling green sugar on top of the frosting I tinted the frosting a deeper shade of green because I thought sugar on top of sugar would be a little much. I used most of an entire bottle of green food coloring. The cut of the marshmallow is crucial! Like the other user my marshmallows kept sliding off so I switched the direction of the cut and no longer had a problem. (It's much easier to cut the marshmallows with scissors instead of a knife.) I used red decorator gel instead of tinting the leftover frosting pink/red. The most time consuming part of the decorating is \"glueing\" on the chocolate chips; I used a toothpick and put the frosting right on the chip. I baked the cupcakes the day before and it took me nearly an hour and a half just to decorate them so while they're really cute I wouldn't make them just to make them.",
