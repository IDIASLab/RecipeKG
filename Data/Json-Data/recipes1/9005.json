Did not measure salad ingredients (only dressing). Ended up with a lot of salad so I doubled dressing. My picky husband enjoyed this! The next day I used the salad (minus bread) as a sauce. I sauteed boneless skinless chicken breast pieces; added salad and heated through and served over pasta. Very tasty. Will definitely make this again!",
