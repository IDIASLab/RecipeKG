I veganized the recipe first by substituting Earth Balance for the shortening, turbinado sugar for the white sugar, 1 TBS ground flaxseed with 3 TBS water for the egg, and whole wheat flour for the A/P flour.  I also drizzled icing over the cookies, after baking:  organic powdered sugar dissolved with a small amount of almond milk until thick but not too runny.  Put into a small ziploc, cut a tiny hole in a corner and drizzle icing over the cookies.  Allow to set before serving.  The cookies came out moist, fluffy, and not overly sweet.  Everyone was impressed, vegetarian and meat-eaters alike.  I'd definitely make these again!",

The citrus soooo compliments the Craisins I used instead of raisins. They don't really spread much so i pushed them down a bit with a fork dipped in sugar so that they were of even thickness. (Dough was very sticky is why the fork had to be dipped in sugar) Used a pretty big cookie scooper...probably like a 3-4 TBSP scoop...so they took about 17 min to cook. they kind of looked like smallish scones...but very tender and moist inside. I like a chubby thick cookie instead of flat ones...so for me they were perfect in size shape and texture...will definitely be making again! Actually tomorrow i will make 2 more batches cause todays are all gone! Can't wait to share them with even more people! =)))..",

After reading reviews, I used butter instead of shortening, but I also exchanged the raisins to little pieces of force ripend persimmon.  This change made them truely \"persimmon\" cookies. Persimmons can be force ripend by putting them stem (still intact) side down on a cookie sheet lined with paper towel, and pouring just enough whiskey to moisten the whole paper towel.  Place all in a plastic bag and seal for one week. Persimmons will be firm, but sweet.  Delicious!!! Any whiskey will do, I go for the cheap stuff.",

One thing I will add though is that the spoonfuls of dough bake out as they are so i would suggest flattening them before baking... Other than that quite a good use for an otherwise useless fruit (IMO).:) thx for the recipes and previous reviews...",
