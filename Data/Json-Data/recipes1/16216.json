        "description": "Tacos al Pastor are a favorite in Mexico and Mexican restaurants throughout the world for good reason: The mixture of smoky, spicy chiles, sweet pineapples and fresh onions and cilantro is taco perfection. Traditionally, Tacos al Pastor are made by marinating pork in chile sauce, layering the meat on a vertical rotisserie, adorning with a pineapple and roasting slowly for hours--a process that's almost impossible to replicate at home. So we've taken the delicious, authentic flavors that make these tacos so special, and adapted the recipe for your home kitchen, so you can enjoy it whenever a craving strikes!",

I would give this 4.5 stars if I could but I'm rounding up since I can't.\n\nFor the sauce I used 5 fresh Anaheim and 2 dried California chillies instead of gujillo (both are fairly mild in heat), 5 large cloves of garlic, 1 tsp. of garlic powder, a 7 oz. can of chipotle chili in adobo, 1 tbsp. canola oil, about 1/4 cup of extra adobo sauce and I put salt and pepper on the roast before coating it with sauce. \n\nI vacuum-pack marinated the meat for 7 hours and instead of stir frying I sous vide cooked the pork roast for 20 hours at 143 degrees in the marinade. \n\nThe tacos turned out incredible but the meat with a bit of sauce and pineapple was delicious to snack a la cart. The meat had a slight kick from the chipotle so it you like a lot of heat add more of those or maybe add a serrano or two with veins. \n\nThis dish is going in my main rotation.",

I put the whole recipe in my crock pot without marinating, cooked on low all day, and made al pastor burritos the first night. The meat was quite tender and delicious, but I knew marinating would have given it more depth. Taco's the next day were great, and the third day I just ate it straight- yummy! \nI did change the pineapple ratio as I don't care for sweet meat. The first day it was sweet, but the second day it had balanced, and the third day it was spicy!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is an awesome starting point. After making the marinade as directed and tasting it I made a few modifications: The marinade needs to be boiled for more than 2 minutes for it to lose the raw onion flavor and I felt that it needed significantly more pineapple juice for it to have the sweet-heat flavor I was trying to recreate. I ended up adding three 8 oz cans of pineapple juice (total) and boiled the marinade for 15 minutes or so to reduce the liquid and let the flavors come together. I also used 2 tablespoons of adobo from the chipotle can added a few tablespoons of brown sugar and a fair amount of salt (I also added salt to taste to the pork while it was cooking). I used fresh pineapple instead of canned. Otherwise followed the recipe to a T. It was a big hit at my house and will definitely be part of our meal rotation. A few tips: There ended up being A LOT of marinade so I used only the marinade that was needed to saturate the meat and set aside the rest to freeze. Glad that I'll be able to make this meal on the fly next time. When I make this again from scratch I will double it so that I have several meal's worth for the freezer. This recipe is labor intensive for sure but definitely worth it! Especially if you can get more than one meal out of it! Also instead of cooking the meat in batches I saved time by using more than one pan. I had one cast iron and one calphalon and both worked equally well.",
