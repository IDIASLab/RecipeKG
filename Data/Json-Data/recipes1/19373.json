Wasn't quite frozen like ice cream coming out of ice cream machine so next time will try to make ahead and put in freezer before serving. Couldn't find the cookies (my son mighta got ahold of them!?). Added a tsp of peppermint flavouring as well: which made a very nice flavour! Will try again closer to recipe but peppermint instead of vanilla flavouring.",
