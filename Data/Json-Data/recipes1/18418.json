While I Baked the zucchini in oven at 450 degrees for 15 minutes , I blended Parmesan cheese with the ricotta cheese. After the 15 minutes I pulled the zucchini from the oven, sprinkled a bit of grated Parmesan in zucchini, then spooned and somewhat spread the ricotta cheese mixture on top and baked for another 30 minutes.It was fabulous!\nDefinitely a keeper....",

I watched the video which had some extra info such as add a fair amount of salt as fresh veggies tend to absorbe a lot of it. Also plain paprika would not do the trick. The smoked paprika which many may not have in their pantry was key. The cayenne on top of the ricotta was another bit of zip that really made it a good recipe. I put it all in my iron skillet which may have helped it to bake just right!",

Make sure you bake it until the ricotta is browned and the zucchini is soft. Next time I'm going to drizzle a little olive oil over the cheese before I bake it. Yum yum yum and healthy too!

It's def worth trying (particularly paired w/a greek flavored meat!) for yourself though. Thanks for the recipe Chef John!",
