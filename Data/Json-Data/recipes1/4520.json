We did not add extra salt due to the salt content in the soup. We used minced fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and added 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/3 - 1/2 cup parmesan cheese. Still bland. Next time I will experiment more and use fresh spinach. I think I will also add some chopped bacon for additional flavor.",
