I have made them at least three times in one week because I find myself craving them. I tried them with canned chicken and that just wasn't as good as the tuna. Great mix of flavors I have also subbed black beans for the olives with great results. I did sub green leaf lettuce for the iceburg and used ortega boxed corn shells but other than that gung ho! Thanks John so very much!",
