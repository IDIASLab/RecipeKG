I can tell this will be a weekly-produced appetizer. A quick tip: be careful not to overblend (liquefy) I accidentally turned my blender on high for a brief period and it liquefied the salsa. It is still GREAT but I prefer a chunkier salsa texture. Thanks so much for your contribution to my household! By the way I figured that it cost 4.00 (WA St.) to make 3 cups!",

I used canned whole peeled tomatoes packed in tomato juice I drained most of juice (not stewed tomatoes). I used a few tabs of regular chopped oniom instead of the green onion. I used 1 whole habernero pepper (seeds removed). I pulsed the ingredients in the food processor for a thick slightly chunky consistency. Pretty hot use less pepper for a milder salsa.

The extra water tomato paste and sugar were because the serranos I had turned out to be SUPER hot and my husband (who loves hot things) requested I \"thin it out so his nose wouldn't run\" and so that's how I toned down the heat. I think that this is very close to perfect though I do feel that the chives contributed nothing that a regular onion wouldn't also have contributed though so while I will make this again I'll use a regular onion (the whole thing too I hate the \"half an onion\" measurements). My salsa looks identical to the only picture posted of this recipe. Thank you for sharing!",
