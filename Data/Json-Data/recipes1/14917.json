I finally found bulgur CAN be found here and the first thing I made was kibbeh. My recipe takes toasted pine nuts (about 1/2 cup) mixed in and you can place the whole mixture in a 9x13 baking pan (foil or glass) and bake it at 350F for 30/35 minutes. It's very popular to serve this way as well. I use to make a little vinaigrette to serve on the side: diced tomatoes, cucumbers, chopped parsley, some hot pepper drops and chopped parsley. My husband fell in love with it and the next time we'll make patties and grill the kibbeh. Thanks for posting, I'm sure everybody will enjoy this dish very much.",

I finally realized why I can't get my Lebanese husband to care for any meatloaf recipes - after eating kibbeh no meatloaf can compare! Only addition I would make is 1/2 c. or so of pine nuts (sold in small bags in the baking aisle with other nuts). Just isn't authentic kibbeh without the pine nuts. (You can also use 1/2 ground turkey and/or 1/2 lean ground beef for your meat if desired; the spices make this recipe!) Yummy!",

When I was studying in Mexico I found that there were quite a few middle eastern restaurants and this dish was very popular. In the US it seems not many people have heard of it. I liked the fact that the mint and onion was mixed right up into the meat/bulgur mix as I've only had it on the side before. I made raita to eat with this b/c I thought the flavors would go well together and it was DELISH!! Thanks for the recipe!",

I had been looking for a recipe for baked kibi (kibbeh) for a while now and this one was the closest to perfect I could find. The only thing that i changed and it is a personal taste thing is added more bulgar and less meat. Oh one other thing for an extra little change gently stir in some fresh toasted almond slices. Thanks again for the great recipe!",
