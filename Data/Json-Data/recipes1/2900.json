I used Betty crocker homestyle instant Mashed potatoes, Becel margarine, and canned coconut milk. The results were perfection. The first time the dough sat wrapped in logs in the fridge for 2 days (5 yr old got a bee sting) and still was perfect. The second batch, I did the potatoes mixture, left it over night in the fridge, added the flour by hand the next evening, pieced them out, rolled and cooked. Those were even softer. Amazing recipe.
