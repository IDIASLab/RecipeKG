I thought I did something wrong I already had the filling so I thought I would try to make it again and make sure I followed the directions perfectly. I waited the said time to unroll it and it did the same exact thing. What a disaster. Now I have to look for something else to make before I go over to friends!!!",

Since there was no flour (which was the appeal of the recipe in the first place) there was no substance to the cake and it turned to mush when layered with my fillings. I am glad to know that I am not the only one who had difficulties in the rolling. Otherwise the cake had a decent flavor a little bitter for my taste though.",
