The only thing that I changed was I added some cut up chicken to the salad to make it just a little more filling but followed everything else exactly. The dressing was wonderful just the right amount of sweetness to it. I made this for dinner tonight but I know that I will be taking leftovers to work for lunches over the next couple of days. I will be making this one again for sure!",
