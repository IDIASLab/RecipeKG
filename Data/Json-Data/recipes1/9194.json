If you're going to do that, reduce the amount of water since it has less time to thicken.  Some have said the dish was too sweet, and that can be countered by using an imported marmalade, which is usually less sweet than American marmalade.",

I too altered the recipe somewhat:  used boneless skinless breasts, baked for 30 minutes, also I cut the water down to less than 1/4 cup and used about a tablespoon of soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of jarred minced garlic.  I didn't cover the dish in the oven and probably should have, as basting didn't actually seem necessary and I could have left it go.  Having a penchant for spicier foods, I think I could increase the amount of curry next time or add a few other spices to kick it up a notch.  Great idea for chicken!",

Since they usually make quite a bit of juice when baked I decreased the amount of water in the recipe. Also I halved the recipe since I was only cooking 2 breasts. To seperate the 2 breasts from the plain one I was baking for my kids I used foil. This kept the sauce right on the chicken instead of spreading out through the pan. I served it with couscous but had so much sauce left I wished I had used white rice. The sauce would have been great over it. The chicken stayed very moist and had a nice appearance. I will be making this again!",
