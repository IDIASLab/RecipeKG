But there is no reason why vegan food cant be delicious. My advise. Make it as written. 5-10 minutes before it is done taste it. The last 5 minutes wont change the taste. If you dont like it modify it per the reviews. I followed most of Athena_Girls advise (minus the red pepper) and a lil garlic (per another review) and the soup was a nice surprise! I was leery about the peanut butter but it worked out great. If you arent sure about it start with 1 Tablespoon. Once you see what it does you'll like it. I also used sweet potatoes/yams. The flavor was great! 4 stars with the modifications. Oh I think I ended up using 4 cups of water. Add a bit of flour if you need to thicken it.",

Speaking of flavor outside of the spices there was none. I looked in the pot while I was cooking and said \"This is a very beige meal.\" The parsnips and turnips which I'd never tried before were not good and I doubt I'll eat them again. One last thing... this makes a LOT of stew. I cut the recipe in half and I could hardly finish one serving. Two servings alone took up an around-three-quart pan. I would suggest something but nothing could really fix this recipe without completely changing it. Oh well.",
