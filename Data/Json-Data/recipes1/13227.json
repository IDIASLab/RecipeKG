I did change the recipe a little...used 12 eggs, 1 lb. of sage sausage, and I chopped up 1 large green bell pepper and 1/2 a large onion and sauted them instead of using the green onions, mushrooms, and canned peppers. I also used 8 oz. of shredded sharp cheddar instead of the 16 oz. of jack cheese after reading the reviews that it was too cheesy. I used a pastry cutter to combine the flour mixture to make sure it wasn't lumpy, and it turned out wonderful! I'll definitely use this again. Thank you!!",

I also did let mine bake for maybe 10 minutes more cause it's had no browning on top after first 50 minutes.",

It was SUPER GOOD, even though I could only refrigerate it for about 3 hours.  For my 1/4 recipe I diced 3 oz. of fully cooked Polish sausage and fried it until it was almost done.  Then I stirred in 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper, 3 sliced green onions, and the 2 oz. of mushrooms, and cooked it all until the veggies were tender.  I did use 3 eggs, to which I added 2 small squirts of Oriental hot chile sauce.  Cut the shredded cheese back to 3-1/2 oz. because I used extra-sharp cheddar.  I thinned the flour/butter mixture with a bit of canned chicken broth because I knew the glop of junk I made would never mix into the egg mixture.  Baked it (covered) in a glass 8-1/2 by 4-1/2 inch loaf dish for about 40 minutes until the center was set, and then about 10 minutes (uncovered) for it to brown.   Do try this with my changes, and you will LOVE it.  Not bland at all!!!  Thank you, Linda, for sharing the basics of this recipe.",
