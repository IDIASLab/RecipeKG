I was so suprised to find this recipe--the exact same one she gave me years ago! It's wonderful and brings back so many childhood memories. I remember she always used whole walnuts. She also put the whole recipe into one 9x13\" pan so it was very thick. She would line the pan with buttered foil letting it hang over the edges of the pan and lift the fudge out when it was cool and cut it into long bars. She wrapped the bars and kept them in the refrigerator for the whole holiday season taking one out at a time to slice thinly for the cookie tray.",

Then I repoured it into my molds and it turned out beautifully. Using quality chocolated really does make a difference.",
