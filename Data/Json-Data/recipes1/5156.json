Cover and cook a few more min until tender. Add mixture to baking dish strategically later two can worth crescent dough on top and sprinkle little bit of cheese on top. Bake until brown n bubbly.

My kids wouldn't touch it not even my 18 month old who loves everything (I mean she ate an entire bunch of chopped chives last week for pete's sake). I would have thrown out the leftovers (and there were plenty) but my husband said he'd take them for lunch.

As previously mentioned this really is like a chicken pot pie and would be great for a cold winter night. Thanks again for all the advice!",
