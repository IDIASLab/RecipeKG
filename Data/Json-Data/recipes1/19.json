Made the cookies into balls and flattened them only slightly on a parchment-lined cookie sheet. Baked them at 350 for 10 mins and let them finish cooking for 2 more mins on the cookie sheet out of the oven. In my experience using parchment is key to turning out great cookies. They are crunch on the outside and chewy in the centre. Made half a batch and it almost overflowed my kitchenaid mixer. I would not have wanted to try and mix this by hand it is a very stiff dough. Also used chocolate chips only no m&ms.",

The only change I made was to add a little bit of everything I had on hand - butterscotch semi-sweet milk and white chocolate chips M&M's (a couple packages of candies are fine - no need to buy a large bag of baking bits). I was able to clear out a lot of odds and ends in my pantry (hooray!) These are now my \"everything but the kitchen sink\" \"monster\" cookies (monster b/c they DO make a MONSTER batch - perfect for bake sales). Used a large cookie scoop (3 T.) to form cookies and baked for 13.5 minutes and they came out uniform in size and chewy. Goes great with a tall glass of cold milk: ) Oh and these keep well - a little crisp but easily softened when dipped in liquid. Thanks!",
