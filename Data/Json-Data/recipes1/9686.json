My hat go off to you, Grannycancook! I did follow the advise that quite a few had in using taco seasoning in place of the chili powder and salt. I used an envelope to 1 lb ground turkey. Also added 1/2 tsp minced garlic and 1 can diced tomatoes with green chilis (Rotel brand). Instead of taco sauce I substituted red enchilada sauce (28 oz) pouring a thin layer on the bottom of the baking dish before filling with a layer of the stuffed pasta shells and pouring rest of sauce to cover the shells. Once they were baked I topped with chopped fresh cilantro, sliced black olives, sliced green onions and fresh diced tomatoes. For sides I served refried beans covered with enchilada sauce and melted Mexican blend cheese and Lime Cilantro Rice following recipe from this web site. Excellent, excellent meal!",

Topped with black olives, diced tomatoes, and sour cream (as mentioned in the introduction), as well as chopped cilantro. I did spread some taco sauce on the bottom of the dish, as I was afraid of the shells drying out during baking. I stuffed the shells early in the day, refrigerated, then let them sit on the counter to warm up a bit while the oven preheated. Turned out great. We loved these, thank you! :)",

I thought that it could use about twice as much sauce as the recipe calls for.  It just didnt seem like there was quite enough to go around.  This is the perfect recipe  for the crumbs at the bottom of the bag of chips.  My bag was about half full but I tipped it to the side and got the crumbs out of the bottom so I didnt have to use any of the \"good\" chips.",

One thing I would do next time is to pour a little sauce on the bottom of the casserole. We found the shells got a little crispy. I mixed the cheeses and (I substituted corn chips) corn chips together then sprinkled over casserole. My daughter suggested that this would be good even without the shells. Will defiantly make again and again.",
