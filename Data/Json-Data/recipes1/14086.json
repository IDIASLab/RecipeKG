Also added some seasonings sprinkled more cheese on top along with a bit of paprika for color. Thanks so much!!",

The potatoes need to be boiled then cooled then grated - skin on (so use left over boiled potatoes or boil the day before). Grating instead of mashing gives it a fluffier texture and makes it less dense.   Also, switch it up by adding grated aged cheddar or Gruyere. However, cubing processed cheese does this tasty dish a huge disservice because the cheese won't evenly melt throughout the dish.  Finally, I'm making it tomorrow for Cdn Thanksgiving. I'm going to add some crumbled blue cheese in with the sour cream to give the dish some extra zing! ",
