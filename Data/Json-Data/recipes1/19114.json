Our favorite version though is to use the Simply Potatoes  Southwest Style hashbrowns instead of the plain hashbrowns.  This gives it a real kick and has tons of flavor.  If I use the Southwest style I leave out the onion.  I don't usually have cornflakes on hand, so, I generally just use crushed Ritz crackers instead.  The potatoes do stay a little firm which we like, but, if you like them softer - I would saute the potatoes a little before mixing everything together.",

The only changes I make are that I use half of the cheese and double the onion. I like big chunks of onion, too. You will not be disappointed! I've tried this with and without the topping and I really prefer it without. UPDATE: This is still my favorite way to prepare hash browns, but I have tried a few additions with some really great results. The best meat additions are either 3 heaping Tbls. Canadian Bacon, diced small or Pancetta, finely diced and saut\u00e9ed. And adding just a pinch of red pepper flakes kicks up the flavor enough to make you wonder \"WHAT is in there\"?",

I also cook the potatoes in a bit of olive oil first for about 20 min in the skillet to soften them.  They can be a bit to crunchy if not cooked before baking.  This casserole is DELISH!",

We like these to be super cheesy..so we double the amount of shredded cheese, and use a 4 cheese/taco blend, as it has more flavor and then we add 1 package of cream cheese that has been melted a bit.  it makes this recipe super cheesy..we also do not add the crumbs on top, but the last 1o minutes we sprinkle another packag of shredded cheese on top and let it melt.
