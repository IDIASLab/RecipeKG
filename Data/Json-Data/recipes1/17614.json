After boiling the noodles (whole wheat), I cut off the ends and used those for the middle layer and they fit perfectly. I ended up adding a splash of milk to the ricotta just to make it easier to spread and needed to double the sauce. I used my colander over the pasta to steam the spinach but it didn't get as done as I'd like so I could only mix half into the cheese blend and then split the rest between each layer. Overall this was pretty good with those two changes in amounts. If using all nine noodles I would need even more sauce and more filling. We got 4 servings with no sides and probably would have gotten 6 if we'd had something else on the table, even with 2/3 the pasta.",

As I was putting it together I did need quite a bit more spaghetti sauce.  Since my husband is also not a huge fan of vegetarian main dishes, I did fix pork chops along with this.  I know a weird combination.  Well I served him a big piece of the lasagna along side of this pork chop.  He questioned the odd combo, but I let him know I was accommodating his need for meat with a meal.  Well, he ate the lasagna without any complaints, liked it, and had a second helping.  MOTTSBELA that is a huge compliment!  Aside from adding more sauce, this lasagna set up very well and held it shape on the plate. Since I know he will eat the spinach in this vegetarian dish, I most definitely will be making it again.  Thanks MOTTSBELA.",
