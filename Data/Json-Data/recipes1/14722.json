I also used burrito sized tortillas and baked them in the oven instaead of in a skillet.  I sprayed a pan with Pam, put the filling and cheese on half a tortilla & folded it in half (this recipe made 4 for me), sprayed the tops with Pam and baked at 350 for 10 minutes then broiled the tops until browned.  Cooking in the oven helps when you want to have them all done at once instead of one at a tme.  I served with homemade guacamole, sour cream and salsa.",

The quesadillas turned out crisp and delicious!  Pretty much followed the recipe to T except I substituted a mexican cheese blend for the montery jack.  Garnished with sour cream, salsa, Chalulu hot sauce, and the green tabasco.  Fantastic!  Will definately make them again!",

I added cumin. Instead of using salsa, I used fresh chopped tomatoes that I put on top of the warm mixture in the quesadillas along with some chopped green onions.  I will definately be making this again.  Its a great meatless dish, but I may try it with chicken some time down the road.",
