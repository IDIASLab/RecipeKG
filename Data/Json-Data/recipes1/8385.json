Not sure what you meant by salad dressing. rest is the same but make sure you drain the pimentos well and squeeze them on paper towels. Will get gloppy if you don't. Also a few good shakes of pepper and you have a speedy dip to serve at home on a road trip or picinic. Not real fancy but practical and tasty.",

I was with 6 other people and we actually tried it before we left for the winery and all agreed it \"needed something.\" So we added garlic salt pepper salt and more mayo/salad dressing. Still - nothing. I'm not a chef but I do know my way around the kitchen and this was not good. Thank God I brought plenty of other dips/spreads and finger sandwiches...because I was charged with bringing the lunch & snacks. This one will have to be removed from my recipe box - which is a shame because it is so very easy to make!",
