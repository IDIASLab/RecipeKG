I also added about a tbsp of grape jelly & that seemed to take away the ketchup taste. I will use again thanks Linda!",

I tried to find little brats (my husband is a cheesehead from Wisc) but not in any stores around my home so got two pkgs of Little Smokies. Only put 1-lb in the slow cooker. Next time will do 2-lbs at outset as there is indeed enough sauce and people won't be disappointed when they go back for more and the Smokies are all gone. I've prepared other similar recipes for potlucks but didn't really care for them personally. That's why I was looking for something better when I found this one. I have to admit it I was one of those disappointed when I went to get a few more and they were gone. But then these are so easy to prepare I can toss everything in the slow cooker for myself anytime I want.",
