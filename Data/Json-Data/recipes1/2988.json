Will last a week and still maintain it's flavor and moistness as long as it is either wrapped well in plastic wrap or placed on a cakestand/plate with lid. I also subbed some items. Not being very big on extracts and preferring truer flavors I used a bit of vanilla bean one bean to be exact and opted for fresh lemon zest about 1/4 of a tsp. I left out the coconut extract and used Puerto Rican Dark(spiced)instead of the rum extract. The end result was fabulous! This is a basic pound cake recipe that will allow you use the flavorings or extracts that you prefer. I tried this recipe again using just vanilla and lemon zest and still obtained spectacular results. Watch your baking time adjust it according to the type/size pan you are using. I used the Fleur d'lis pan and had enough batter left over to make a few individual bundt cakes. Hope this review helps or gives you some new ideas!",

The glaze is a must makes the cake so extra wonderful! I did not pour the glaze over the cake I brushed it on with a pastry brush. One problem it boiled over the 12 cup bundt pan I used..next time I will use less of the batter in the bundt pan then maybe make a small loaf also. This pound cake has to be the best cake I have ever eaten. Everyone at work raved about the taste and moistness. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!",

The only thing that I do differently is brushing on the glaze in layers while the cake is still hot so that it can soak into the cake. Then I chill the cake for a few hours then add powdered sugar to the glaze mixture and add a final coat before serving or wrapping individually. Thank you very much for this great recipe I will cherish it always.",
