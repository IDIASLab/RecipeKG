But they say a way to a man's heart is through his stomach and I am jonesing for a new digital camera that costs 900 so I made the salad. And to my surprise it is quite good. We had nicely ripened yet firm tomatoes and this made huge amount of salad. My dh hasn't tried it yet but I know he will love love love it. You think the mustard is going to be to much but it isn't. It makes a great summer salad! I will make this again and I will eat it too even though I doubted the recipe at first.",

I omitted the onion because I don't like it subbed olive oil for veg and toasted the mustard seeds to bring out the flavor and add a nice smoky touch to the dish (which probably mellowed the tang a bit). I served it over romaine but it's delicious on its own as well. This is a new favorite!",
