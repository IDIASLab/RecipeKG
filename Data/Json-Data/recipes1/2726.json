The first 9 small cookies I made following recipe. My hub & kids liked the next 9 I mixed in choco chips we loved the last 9 I mixed in even more choco chips & walnuts. Delicious. It's an ice/snow day here in Rowlett we didn't have school so I am looking for ways to keep the house warm with the oven going all day & entertain everyone with good food.

I would highly reccomend them if you need a fast easy cookie. UPDATE!!!! I tried to multiply this recipie times 5 for a big event and it DID NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!! If you are thinking about multiplying the recipie maybe twice is okay but not more than that! Dont do it you will waste ingredients. The dough came out super greasy I think because of the eggs. I tried to recover by adding flour but it was disastourous.",
