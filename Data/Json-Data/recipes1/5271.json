I added pepper, garlic, onion and chili powder to the chicken while I cooked it then like another reviewer added shredded carrot, diced green pepper, cheese and bean spouts.  I then threw in a few chopped jalepeno peppers as well.  It was soooo good!!  Next time I'm going to try putting this filling in spring roll pastry cause when I baked the won tons they were hard around the edges and rubbery in the middle...maybe I need to lower the oven temp?  All in all a fabulous idea, I'm hooked!!",
