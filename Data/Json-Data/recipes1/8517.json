The recipe is not misprinted--there is no oil or fat in the cake, so do not feel compelled to add it. For those who insist a cake requires fat, think of angel food cakes! This is a delicious cake, very moist, full of pineapple flavor. \"My\" Catherine's recipe also included a cup of chopped nuts. Thanks, Catherine, for posting this bit of nostalgia. ",

You need to have some sort of oil or fat in your cake otherwise it will turn out rubbery and the sugar will burn.  I mixed the sugar with the butter and then added the egg and vanilla.  I mixed the flour and the baking soda in a separate bowl and added a pinch of salt before adding the butter/egg/sugar mixture to it.  I also only cooked it a half hour.  \n\nFor the icing i doubled the cream cheese and added 8 oz of crushed pineapple including juice and 1/3 cup shredded coconut.  It turned out great!",

All I had was a can of sliced pineapple rings so I crushed them by hand and drained enough juice so it was the consistancy of a can of crushed. The cake doesn't rise as much as other cakes but it looks and tastes fine and as for those who said it was hard you must have overcooked it - this recipe yielded a very nice moist cake that would be fine even without frosting.

I reserved about 1/4 cup of the juice, which I originally planned to add to the frosting but found that the frosting was perfect as is. Instead I brushed it over my cake with a pastry brush after baking. I found that my cake was done sooner than the recipe stated... I took it out as soon as it turned a dark brownish color on top, which scared me at first as I thought it had burned a bit but it was perfect! The cream cheese frosting & texture of the cake reminded us a lot of carrot cake. It was absolutely fabulous & will definitely make this one again!",

This is pretty much the same recipe as she used (for the cake part, not the frosting), except she added one more teaspoon of vanilla & 1/2 cup of chopped nuts.  For this cake to be really moist, the secret is using canned crushed pineapple in heavy syrup.  That probably sounds like sugar overload, but trust me you won't be disappointed (especially if you have just a small piece -- everything in moderation, right?).  The syrup in the pineapple makes this cake dense and delicious.  She used a totally different cream cheese frosting than the one printed.  Your favorite recipe will do.  My 5 star rating is for the memories I had of my mother making this wonderful cake!",
