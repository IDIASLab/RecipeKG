I will have to get a picture up the next time I make them for all you that may be skeptical about trying them. I also soak the chestnuts in soy sauce for a few minutes and dredge them in some brown sugar before rolling them up it adds some extra flovor. The key is to make sure to get the bacon real crisp MAKE SURE TO DRAIN THEM and when you add the sauce dont cook to long or it will create grease in the sauce from the bacon...cook just enough to heat. They look wonderful and the sweetness bacon and crunch go great together!",

I fried the bacon until it just started going a wee bit brown before wrapping them around the water chestnuts. I also added a few drops of hot sauce to the mixture before brushing it on. One more thing -Use a broiling pan when you first put them in the oven so the fat will drain off. Then if you want you can use a glass pan once you put on the sauce.",
