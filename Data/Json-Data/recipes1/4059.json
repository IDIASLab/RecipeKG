After I dissolved the jello in the hot water I used cold orange soda in place of the cold water. I left the \"frosting\" just as is with the whipped topping milk and instant vanilla pudding. I wanted it to be more like a Dreamsicle instead of all orange. I studded the top with mandarin oranges. It was a hit. And just like I remember Dreamsicles. Very good light summer dessert. I plan on making this for future BBQ get-togethers.",

We had a large family gathering and this cake was loved by all! I wanted to make something that my young daughter could help to prepare and feel proud of. It turns out this was a great choice. The recipe was very easy. We used Sugar Free Orange Jello and Sugar Free Vanilla Pudding (You couldn't tell ANY difference in the taste) and regular Cool Whip. The cake was very light cool and not too sweet.... Overall it came out perfect and was extremely delicious! I'll definitely be making this again!",
