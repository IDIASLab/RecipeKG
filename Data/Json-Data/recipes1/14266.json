This recipe is flexible to adapt to what you have on hand in the kitchen or what you want to throw in. Here's what I did: I used a jar of diced tomatoes a handful of Mexican blend cheese dried basil and a handful of cooked and crumbled bulk sausage (Neeses). I didn't have parsley and omitted the salt and pepper at the front so I could season to taste. The first bite was good but we both agreed that it needed just a little something to make it really really good. We both added a touch of fresh ground pepper and a shake of dried and grated parmesan & romano cheese. This was all it needed and my husband declared this to go on heavy rotation as a quick dinner. This is quick has a summertime fresh flavor and is highly adaptable. I think the diced tomatoes are better than the halved cherry tomatoes as it distributes the tomato flavor more evenly with each bite. I will probably plan to cook this next time and get fresh basil tomatoes and mozarella cheese. I might look for fresh cheeze ravioli but the frozen was very good.",
