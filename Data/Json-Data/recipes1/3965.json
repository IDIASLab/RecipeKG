My only problem which was easily fixed is that i have a tendency to make BIG cookies. I found after my first batch that I used too much dough around the kiss resulting in a palm size flat cookie with a hump in the middle. After that I used just enough to cover the candy and they then came out like the picture. This is a crisp cookie--not chewy at all and not too sweet. the candy inside is a great balance for flavors. Edit one year later: I just made these again for Christmas adn they turned out even better than last year! I followed the recipe EXACTLY as it was written. Last year I subbed butter for margarine and I think that was a mistake! These cookies help their shape and barely spread at all using the margarine. My hubby calls me a \"butter snob\" because that is usually the only thing I buy. I'm not even sure what made me change my mind and get margarine this year but it was definitely worth it! I'll be using margarine in these form now on!",
