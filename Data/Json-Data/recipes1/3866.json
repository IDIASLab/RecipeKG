I baked the pizzas on a preheated stone (no pre-bake) with my oven on its highest setting (broil) and topped the pizza with blended Muir Glen tomatoes (pinch of salt pinch of sugar pinch of oregano) fresh mozzarella peccorino romano fresh basil and a little black pepper. The pizzas were absolutely divine with crusts that were thin and perfectly crisp beneath the toppings and thick and bubbly along the edge. I highly recommend this crust!",

I roll out the crusts onto the pans cover with plastic wrap and tin foil and then freeze. When we want pizza we just grab one out and put the toppings on and stick it in the oven! Halfway through cooking time I do slide the pizza off the pan and right on to the oven rack because we like a crispy curst. The crust is great and smells like pizza heaven. At first when I read the directions I thought... I don't want to put it in the fridge to rise! Then I watched a Good Eats with Alton Brown and he said the best way to let a pizza crust rise in slowly in the fridge. My dough still tripled in size in just a few short hours in the fridge!",
