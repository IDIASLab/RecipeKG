Shallots or onions are a nice touch, but certainly not necessary, but fresh garlic, on the other hand, is. Also,if you're going to be making a lot of spinach, don't add it to the pan all at once.  Add more spinach to the pan as each addition wilts, which will occur rapidly. Substituting butter for the olive oil is not a good idea, as butter has such a low burning temperature. So if you'd like to add butter, do so at the end. This is a simple and delicious way to prepare fresh spinach!",
