Duck fat is one of my new favorite things and luckily they sell it at a new high end store by me since I have never cooked with duck to get the fat:) I was not able to cook the sprout at 450 because I had something else in the oven as well. Still turned out good but will try at the higher temp. to see if I get them a little crispier. Thanks once again Chef John!!",
