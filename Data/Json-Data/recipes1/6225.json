I think one needs to soak the berries with the sugar for longer than 10 mins more like 45 mins if possible - I also added basil leaves for fragrance. The balsamic vinegar and pepper served separately for your guest to add himself gives the sweetness a subtle complexity. Good accompaniment for a savory breakfast dish.",

I must say if you do make it don't make it ahead of time and let it sit before you serve it otherwise you lose the flavour of the balsamic vinegar. I noticed when I made it you could taste it and it was a nice combination but by the time we actually served dinner (an hour later) it just tasted like sweet strawberries. Give it a go just serve it right away!",
