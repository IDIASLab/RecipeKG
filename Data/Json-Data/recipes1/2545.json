I told them to each help themselves to \"a\" cupcake. I went about my business and they with theirs. Next thing I know I see two of three guys with frosting moustaches and the plate with nine cupcakes gone! They said thank you several times proclaimed the cupcakes amazing and told me I was \"a good woman.\" Once they left I tried one myself--yep they're good. REALLY good. When making the batter I used the coffee hot. I read somewhere that hot coffee or boiling water has some kind of reaction with the cocoa that makes it bloom and bring out the depth of its flavor. I frosted these dark moist and chocolatey cupcakes with my own vanilla buttercream frosting. There are now two left for Hubs when he gets home!",

Instead, it gave it a unique flavor not  achievable with either water or milk.\n\nThe texture was wonderful. Here's a hint for novices: this texture is only achieved if your butter/sugar mixture does NOT separate when you add the egg. So scramble the egg briefly and add it to the mixture a little at a time). Instead of icing, I put (Stonyfield) yogurt on it (full fat and plain as I like it) while my husband ate his cake with vanilla ice cream. A keeper! Thank you. BTW this cake is just as delicious plain or with some walnuts in it.",

I get 16 cupcakes out of this recipe and bake them for 20 min or doubled, I bake it 50 minutes in a bundt pan or 40 minutes in a 9X13. My only change is using piping hot coffee instead of cold.  This cake isn't very sweet but it's ... just perfect.  If you have a big sweet tooth you might want to ice it with a fairly sweet icing.  Creamy Chocolate Frosting from this site is a great topper!  The cake is delicious plain or frosted and has a wonderfully moist texture that isn't wet or fudgy.  Don't worry if you're not a coffee drinker because it doesn't leave even the slightest hint of coffee flavor but it definitely enhances the chocolate so don't skip it!  It freezes well and was very easy to work with when making my son's robot cake for his birthday.  Absolutely fantastic and even better the second day!  Thank you!  This is what chocolate cake should taste like!",

You can't taste the coffee in the finished product - it just enhances the chocolate flavor. We have a divine family recipe for chocolate cake, and the secret ingredient is coffee. Just try it!\n\nIf you're making cupcakes, don't put too much batter in each cup. The top flattens out over the pan if they rise above the top of the cup once you take them out of the oven. This makes it very hard to remove the cupcakes from the pan with the top intact. A cookie scooper (2 Tbsp, I believe) was the perfect amount of batter for mini cupcakes. The mini cupcakes baked in 10 minutes and this recipe yielded 42 minis.\n\nI used 2/3 cup of strong brewed coffee and 1/3 cup of french vanilla and hazelnut flavored Kahlua (coffee liqueur). It still amounts to one cup of liquid, but with a little extra kick!\n\nI frosted these with the Coffee Butter Frosting from this site. Again, trying to use that leftover coffee...\n\nThis cake was indeed simple and delicious! Thank you J. Miller!",
