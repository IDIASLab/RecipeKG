I read another similar recipe that cooked at 400 degrees and since several reviwers said the cooking time indicated wasn't enough I used the higer temperature. For my smaller batch 15 minutes at 400 degrees worked perfectly. This is the oddest recipe ever but it really works though you'll have your doubts when pouring boiling water into the flour mixture. The cake is just a bit heavier than traditional angel food but that was good for my purposes I wanted to make a rolled cake. I turned the very warm cake onto a tea towel dusted with powdered sugar and rolled it up till cool then unrolled and filled with lemon filling. Frosted with whipped cream it was a very light and tasty dessert.",
