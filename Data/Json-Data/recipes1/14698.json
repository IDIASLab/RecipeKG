I used a 2 pound pork tenderloin and because my biggest fear is the dreaded \"dried out\" pork I chose to marinate this first. I mixed together some olive oil, garlic, rosemary, a pinch or two of kosher salt and a few splashes of white wine vinegar. I poked a few holes in the meat, cut it into kabobs (for more even cooking on the grill) and put everything into a ziploc bag. I let that marinate for 6 hours.  I skewered the meat onto kabobs and and started grilling. For the glaze I used 3 Tbsp. of stone ground mustard for every 1/4 cup of apricot preserves (flipping the amounts) I felt the sweetness should come through more than the spicy. I microwaved the preserves for a few seconds in order to mix in the mustard better and reserved a bit of it as a dipping sauce. This turned out oh so good! I served this with \"Baked Sweet Potatoes\" by JennCook and \"Tangy Mango Slaw\" from this site.",
