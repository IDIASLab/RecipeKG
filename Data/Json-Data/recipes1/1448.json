If you want to add a special touch (both for the eyes and the tongue) blend 6oz of cream cheese with 1/4 to 1/2 c. white sugar (depending on how sweet you have made the bread and how sweet you want the cream cheese to be) and 1 egg or 1/4 cup of egg substitute. Put 1/3 of the batter in the pan then 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture 1/3 of the batter the rest of the cream cheese mixture and the rest of the batter. You can take a butter knife and run it through a few times if you want a swirl. I made muffins and reduced the cook time to about 35-40 minutes.",
