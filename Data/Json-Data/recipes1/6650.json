I looked at another recipe (Remoulade Sauce a la New Orleans) for the sauce on this site as well, and used this recipe + 1 Tbsp. Creole mustard and 1 Tbsp. lemon juice in in the sauce as the other recipe called for.  The mustard and lemon juice added flavor and it was delicious, but possibly not thick enough.  Try adding all the called for ingred. and then testing it with mustard and lemon juice. I also just sliced the avocados and placed the shrimp mixture on top of them for ease.  Also, make sure you dry your shrimp very well.",

The ingredients in the dressing never blended together to create a cohesive whole. The recipe calls for far too much Worcestershire and even after cutting it by more than half it was still way too much. The dressing itself tasted of basically nothing more than mayonnaise and chili sauce. In addition there was so MUCH of the sauce that it was just a bunch of goosh that all but obliterated the taste of the shrimp even after more than doubling the shrimp to compensate. While this was a pretty salad it unfortunately wasn't to our liking. There is just too much wrong with this recipe other than using a different dressing entirely to offer any helpful suggestions to improve it.",

Tossed the chopped lettuce leaves with a bit of lemon juice/spritz of oil and S&P. I halved the avocados and placed the lettuce inside. I squeezed some lemon on the shrimp and mixed with the dressing....but I cut the worcestershire sauce down to 3/4 tsp and added 3/4 tsp. of crystal hotsauce.(my favorite) but Franks or any other would work great and amount added could be to taste. Placed the shrimp mixture on top of the lettuce. Little spice/heat in each bite with the cool lettuce and avocado. It was delicious and thanks Inga for a great base recipe.",

I made a bed of romaine lettuce from my garden and sliced the avacado because my husband hates it then I put dobbs of the salad between the slices! It looked beautiful and my man could avoid what he didn't like. The sauce was PERFECT although I did have to add some large cooked shrimp to give it a \"shrimp\" taste. Frozen salad shrimp have NO taste at all. Anyway it was gone and I didn't get to have any at all. I did however have my share when I made it so I knew it was good. I would make it again but not use salad shrimp and not serve it to my husband because it would definitely be great served in the half of an avacado!!! A ladies only luncheon dish....",
