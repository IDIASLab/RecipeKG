I somewhat halved the recipe for four large chicken breasts bonein using these measurements: 1/2c soy 1/2c water 2T brown sugar 1/4t ginger 1/2t garlic 2T onion 2T sherry. I marinated them for a few hours then baked in the marinade (what used to be) skin side up. Covered it in foil for 45 minutes uncovered last 15. No one gave compliments but they didn't complain (as usual) either.:/:) The trick to add water is a good one. Adding water you get the flavor without the toughness it can cause. Oh after baking I thickened the strained pan drippings with 2T cornstarch.",
