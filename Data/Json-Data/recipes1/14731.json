We substituted yellow onions with green onions and substituded cream of mushroom soup with cream of chicken soup, and add more cheese than the recipe calls for.  The packet we tested after 20 minutes still had raw potatoes and took 40 minutes to cook.  The other two packets we didn't test, and, what I didn't realize at the time was my husband had cooked the other two packets over direct heat, cooking them faster and they were burned by the time we caught it (after 40 minutes).  The burning was our fault.\n\nThe second time we cooked this when we went camping.  We skipped stirring the ingredients in a bowl.  After spraying both sides of tin foil with olive oil non-stick spray, we just compiled the ingredients directly on the tin foil.  (We were tent camping and wanted as few dishes to wash as possible.)  We again substitued green onions with yellow onions and cream of mushroom soup with cream of chicken soup, and added more cheese than the recipe calls for.  We didn't use any butter.  We layered the potatoes and onions and kind of tossed with our clean hands, then added the rest of the ingredients.  We cooked over charcoal briquettes in a camp fire, but had to add some pieces of kindling occasionally to keep the fire hot enough to cook.  We cooked the packets for about 30 minutes, and they were perfect, not burned at all but cooked well.",

We rotate back and forth between cream of mushroom and chicken soup depending on what's grilling...  HELPFUL HINT: To cook a little faster precook your potatoes, but do not slice them until you are ready to cook - this saves on propane or briquettes.  Or buy the Simply Potatoes which are already pre-sliced and ready to go.  Great timesaving steps!!!",

I wasn't sure how we would know when they were done well, but the soup creates steam and the foil packs began to inflate.  When that starts to happen they are done. I cooked these first and then pulled them off and cooked our chicken, which also took a while.  These were still piping hot when we unwrapped them even after sitting all that time.  My suggestion would be to cook these first.  As they sit the flavors blend together better!  The only change I made was that I had no cream of mushroom so I used cream of chicken.  Even my finicky three year old LOVED them!!!",
