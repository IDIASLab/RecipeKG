However, the ingredients are just what you need to achieve that special Ginger dressing found in most sushi restaurants.\nSo, instead of tweaking batch after batch to reach your intended flavor, just keep close and coarsley chop each of the ingredients so they're readily available to toss into your blender as needed. And besides, I'm sure many of you true asian cuisine cooks know how little we ever measure ingredients!!  To further explain:\n\nGinger-(Best fresh from root or even the pickled kind--NOT powdered, it can add a bitter taste and ruin that light salmon color)\nPeanut Oil-(NOT olive oil NOR sesame oil. Tried both to frightening results. The peanut oil is key! It's what makes the creamy taste and texture)\nCelery-(only fresh, and don't be afraid of adding more--it gives the dressing that fresh, crisp taste)\nOnion and Garlic-(NO powdered stuff either, this is where you can add a little bit at a time to your blender it can indeed over power your dressing)\nSalt/Soy sauce-Use either, but I prefer Fish sauce as it doesn't ruin the color and since it's saltier it only requires a small amount)\nThe Ketchup-(I just recommend a bit of fresh tomato--using ketchup can also add a funnyl, stale taste)\nThe lemon juice & rice wine vinegar-(use the real stuff--it's not that expensive and both are versatile in lots of dishes)\nThe Pepper & Sugar-(Didn't feel the nee",

Some changes I would make would be to use olive oil instead of the peanut oil. The nutty flavor overpowers the fresh ginger flavor I'm used to. I reduced the vinegar 1/2 cup and then added water to the 1/3 cup line. I added 1 stalk of celery instead of the suggested 2T. I also added and additional tsp. of sugar and omitted the pepper. The dressing at jap. restraunts seem to have alot of texture so I added 1 1/2 carrots in the blender and it came out perfect. It took 3 trys but now I make it for all my family and friends, we LOVE it!",

Why bother when we are blending it all?!  I made a chicken and salad dish, and not only used the dressing on the salad, but I drizzled it on the meat too.  My husband loved it!

It might be wise to specify to use REAL white onions, celery, ginger, garlic and chop it yourself, not powdered or bottled minced spices. I used bottled minced onions on my first attempt, however the result was far too acidic. Fresh chopped white onions did the trick. As for the ketchup, I recommend using the homemade ketchup, not heinz. Do not subtitute any ingredients for the ones listed. I achieved the best result using the suggested recipe. Some suggested using olive/sesame oil and white wine vinegar as substitutes, but doing so will stray the taste from the real japanese restaurant salad dressing we all love. Many thanks to the one who posted this recipe! It's perfect!",
