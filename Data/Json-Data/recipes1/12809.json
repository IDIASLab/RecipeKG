A CUP OF WATER IS TOO TOO MUCH, AND IT MAKES THE BEANS WATERY.  This is defintely a keeper.",

I too used pinto beans omitted the salt added more garlic two cans of green chiles and only about a quarter tsp. of the smoke and a lot less water. For the reviewer who commented on the fact that this was not totally fat free; beans alone have a very small fat content. Most canned refried beans are made with lard hence the reason that these would be considered fat free. Good eats Lisa and thanks!",
