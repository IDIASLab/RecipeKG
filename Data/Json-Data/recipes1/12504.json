I used \"hot\" taco seasoning so I left out the chili powder and red pepper; but the pork didn't really soak up much of the taco seasoning. Next time I'll try shredding the pork right in the pot letting it soak up some of the flavored water then draining and serving. Our 1 1/2 lb pork shoulder was done in a little over 6 hours and made enough for three large \"chimichangas\". We put the pork in multigrain tortillas wrapped them up and baked them for about 15 minutes to get them a little crunchy then served over a bed of lettuce with chopped red bell pepper chopped scallions salsa black olives and a little cheese -- a great dinner!",
