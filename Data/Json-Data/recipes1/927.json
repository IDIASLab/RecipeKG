For you nut lovers try adding pecans to the batter also. Very good! I would try less sugar next time. Maybe 2 1/2 cups instead of 3. It's a little sweet for my taste. I also increased the vanilla to 1/2 tbsp for more flavor.",

I've decided either can be used with perfect results.  Moist, dense, buttery and delicious, just as a good pound cake should be - so long as you cream the butter and sugar well, don't overmix once the flour mixture is added, and don't overbake! I skipped the pecans and threw in maybe 1-1/2 cups of blueberries.  To finish, I topped the cake with a glaze of powdered sugar and lemon juice.  I used a specialty Bundt cake pan and between it and the polka dots of blueberries it made for a beautiful presentation! ",

I usually do this without the pecans and bake in loaf pans. Half of the recipe makes one large loaf pan or three small. I also vary the flavoring depending on how I'll be serving this. Some of my favorites include coconut rum and almond flavorings instead of the vanilla. Try this...cut a slice of pound cake place on a sheet of foil. Butter cake slice and top with a slice of pinapple place a marachino cherry in the center of the pineapple sprinkle with about a tsp. of brown sugar. Wrap in the foil; place on the grill and grill until nice and hot; about 10 min. Delicious!",
