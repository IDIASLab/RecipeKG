It's almost a waste of calories because the 3/4 lb. of cubed cheese doesn't translate into a sumptious cheesy enchilada. It cooks too hard and runs out of the enchilada. I think a way to improve this recipe would be to increase the amount of green sauce to reduce the cooking time or to reduce the cooking heat. I think if I do this again I will also add some jalapeno pepper into the filling because as it's right now it's so non-distinct. The flavoring inside the tortilla is the same as outside so it all comes out tasting the same.",

I also made some changes to the recipe: I marinated the chicken in lime juice chili powder garlic salt pepper diced green chilis and jalapenos (one small can each) and a bit of tequila for a few hours before cooking. I used shredded mexican jack in each tortilla instead of adding to total mixture and I used 3 cans of green enchilada sauce. I also slow sauteed diced jalapenos and serrano chilis in olive oil and served over the top (taste buds permitting). Thanks Dawn and all the others who have helped make this a terrific dish. Ole!",
