I simplified the serving process by pre-scooping the mix into styrofoam cups and keeping them in the freezer.  That way guests could just grab a cup of mix from the freezer and add the rum and cider instead of wrestling with the ice cream scoop.  \r\n\r\nInstead of using water, I used a mixture of 4 parts water and 1 part apple cider.  I think this is a great recipe for a party because people add their own alcohol so it helps non-drinkers blend in with the other guests and they don't have to advertise the fact they aren't drinking alcohol.  Kids also really liked it - they started calling it \"Hogwarts's Butter Beer\" after Harry Potter.",
