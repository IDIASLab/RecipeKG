                "reviewBody": "This recipe was amazing.  I chose it because, unlike many of the other \"make ahead\" french toast recipes, it truly was 100% ready to go in the morning.  Just pop it in the oven.  When I made it I used one can of apples, and made sure it was apples and water only--no high fructose corn syrup--to keep the recipe from being over-the-top sweet.  The apples turned out so delicious, next time I probably will use two cans.  I used Pepperidge Farm cinnamon raisin bread, and baked for 90 minutes.  Everything else I kept exactly the same.  I used a cake pan and had no problems with it boiling over.  I didn't turn it upside down, and I thought it made a very nice presentation \"as is\" with the cinnamon swirl bread.  The bread wasn't incredibly crispy, as pan fried French toast can be, but it certainly wasn't gooey either.  I think using a slightly more substantial bread, like Italian or the cinnamon swirl, instead of white or French, makes a big difference.  I made it for a brunch for 11 people, and everyone absolutely raved about it. It was so incredibly simple--15 minutes the night before and you're done.  This will definitely become a staple in my house.  Thanks for a real keeper!  Note:  I made this again and didn't bake it as long.  Yuck!  Make sure you bake it long enough.",

I have always been able to fit eighteen slices of bread in my 9x13 pans (three layers of six). This bakes up perfectly in 70-75 minutes. Spraying the tin foil is an absolute MUST or it will stick.

First time I made a 9x13 and could only fit 18 slices of bread, 2nd time I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 and fit about 10 pieces of bread. When it says to \"press down\", press down with some force, not  patting the bread. The first time I made it, I used the canned apple pie filling and it was good, but too sweet (and i LOVE sweet stuff). The 2nd time I peeled and sliced apples, put them in raw, and it turned out awesome! Both times I baked mine no less than an 1hr and20min.  I put a cookie sheet lined with tin foil under it to avoid bubbling over. I made sure to spread the egg mixture evenly over the bread w/ spatula, almost rubbing it in.  Spraying the tinfoil so it doesn't stick to the bread is helpful.  Also, I didn't invert it either time and it presented great and didn't seem to make a difference. People will be asking for the recipe guaranteed!",
