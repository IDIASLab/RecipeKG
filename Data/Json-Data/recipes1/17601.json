I realize this is a Johnsonville recipe, but the ground sausage wasn't sold at the store I went to so I used italian ground turkey (which is healthier anyway) and turned out just as good in my opinion. Also, made my own marinara/basil/red wine sauce. One other thing I changed that seemed to add a little more flavor was I sauteed the garlic and onions separate from the meat/marinara sauce and put them in with the ricotta spinach with a little powdered garlic as well. I'm sure it doesn't matter but I don't like plain layers of ricotta when you get that bite. I flavored my own sauce with oregano so it was in the pasta, not just on top like the recipe says (I would recommend making the sauce with more spices, even if you buy jarred).\n\nAlso, add on a few more sprinkles of mozzarella on top about 10 mins before the lasagna is supposed to be done... then leave in the oven for just a tad longer than it's supposed to once you turn the oven off so the italian spices brown a little and the flavors blend (YUM!!!)",

However my main disappointment is that the sausage was very greasy. I usually cook with very lean ground beef so this was a bit on the heavy side for me. I drained the meat in a colander and pressed on it with paper towels to get out as much of the grease as I could but when I cut the first piece there was a rush of liquid in the pan and at least 3/4\" of grease gathered where the piece had been. All that aside it gets four stars because my kids ate it and my daughter even had seconds. Next time I make this I will use a spicier sausage and really really drain the grease off.",
