Extra strawberries, skipping the strawberry topping, and maybe even adding some extra cream cheese next time. We put it in cupcake papers in a muffin pan in the freezer...and also filled some little waffle cones and froze those as well. We love the 'cheesecake-y' treat that is so easy and it has fruit so it is healthy, right? ",

I just put in the cream cheese a little extra milk the pudding mix and the cool whip and I put it all in a blender with some frozen strawberries and it turned out so good. I crushed some graham crackers b/c that's all I had mixed in some melted butter and made me a crust. I poured the filling over it froze it and what a treat!:) Will definitely make it again.",

My fresh strawberry pieces were jaw breakers and when I let it sit out so they would melt a little the pudding/cream cheese/cool whip/cookie part turned into mush quickly with no crispy cookie texture. I used my own homemade strawberry freezer jam in place of the ice cream topping and that gave it a really great strawberry taste. All in all I'd say this dish has an identity crisis: Is it ice cream? Is it pudding? Is it cheesecake? Beats me. I won't be making it again and I'm not looking forward to finishing the rest of it that's still in the freezer. Sorry.",

In place of the cream cheese milk pudding and cool whip I used one tub of Philly's Ready-To-Eat Cheesecake filling. In addition to the strawberries I added chunks of bananas and a small can of crushed pineapple (drained). In place of the strawberry sauce I used a jar of hot fudge sauce and swirled it in scooped into waffle ice cream cones and then pushed the tops into chopped walnuts wrapped each individually in plastic wrap and froze. This is what I call a Cheesecake Banana Split in a cone. Adults and kids alike loved them!!",
