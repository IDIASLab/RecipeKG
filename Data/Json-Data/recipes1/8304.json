No one can believe it is made with saltine crackers!\r\n\r\nI usually make it in a rectangular casserole so there is extra room, assemble the filling and whipped cream in the dish, and cut it like a cake.  People can then just help themselves to a piece, especially at parties where a host may not be available to show them how to assemble it.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Don't do this too far in advance though, or the crust will become soggy.",

Once it cooled in the pan she would spread the cool whip and then top with the cherries...she would use a spoon and place each individual cherry to make sure there was enough to cover beautifully. We've used many other toppings over the years too...strawberry blueberry pineapple etc. Everyone is always shocked to hear about the saltines.:o)",
