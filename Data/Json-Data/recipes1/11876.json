I nixed the garlic powder and onion powder and used panko for the breadcrumbs. And even though some reviewers mentioned that their dish turned out soggy, I added extra butter anyway. Of course, the one day that I needed fresh scallops, our seafood market here at the beach was out! But frozen worked out just fine. Just let the bag thaw out in a bowl of cold water for about 30 minutes and then dry them between paper towels. The scallops turned out amazing. I am still getting compliments from my house! Thanks!",

I combined the bread crumbs and fresh grated parmesan cheese, used old bay seasoning in place of the spices.  I dipped them quickly in the butter then dredged them in the bread crumb mixture. The only thing I will try differently the next time is broilng them the last few minutes to make the topping a little crunchier.  I served this with Daddy's fried corn as another reviewer had suggested.  Great dinner.  Too bad I didn't have anyone to share it with! (b/f doesn't like scallops so I made it for myself when he was out of town).",

If you're heating this up the next day be sure to put it back in the oven and not the microwave. This is a keeper!",

They resemble the larger Sea Scallops and obviously are not the same quality as true fresh Sea scallops, however, with this recipe, they tasted like the real thing. To get a more consistent looking scallop, instead of sprinkling the mixture over them, I recommend you first \"roll\" them in the melted butter and then \"roll\" them in the mixture in a separate bowl. Then place them in the dish for baking.",
