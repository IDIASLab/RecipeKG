Gave my sister the recipe but she didn't have the cardamom. She really noticed the difference. I'm convinced that the spice makes all the diference. I also experimented with a gluten-free version (my father is celiac) substituting oatmeal flour. I lined my pumpkin pies with the dough for the crust. It puffed up quite a lot but I got a lot of compliments on the pie. Next time I would reduce the backing soda for that application (duh!). Anyway these are a new favorite for sure!",
