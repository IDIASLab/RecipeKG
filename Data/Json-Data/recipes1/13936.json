It was \"okay\" but I have to suggest a few changes: As said by someone else - you CAN brown the mince and onions in a pan!! (I usually do). Then add the seasoning 1 pinch of ground cloves 1 pinch of ground coriander seed. Use 2 slices of soaked bread that haven't been drained too well and mix into the mince. Then place in a baking dish. Bake at 200C for about 15min. For the topping: if using 2 eggs it gives a lighter and fluffier dish if you use about 150/200ml of milk (maybe even more if you like the creamy topping). Bake 20 min. To make it even easier: If you're frying the mince before baking - place the seasoned mince in a baking dish and pour over the topping immediately. Bake at 200C for 35-45min. untill golden brown. The topping seeps into the mince mixture giving you a deliciously moist dish. Serve with yellow rice with raisins. (Just steam your rice with some tumeric raisins and a pinch of cinnamon). A light green salad slices of banana and caramalised sweet potatoes make it complete.",

                "reviewBody": "The recipe is fine as long as it's kept in mind that as a trad. dish there are hundreds of small variations. I use apricot jam instead of chutney but a fruity quite sweet chutney is fine. One reviewer was wrong when she said the meat and onions are always fried in a pan first. No this should be a quick dish (once you have the ingredients) and I certainly have never fried the meat first. One person altered the recipe so much that it could not bear much resemlance to the original! I understand about the milk allergy but why leave out the breadcrumbs? It improves the texture. Try soy milk next time or yoghurt if that's okay. The egg-milk-turmeric custard should be poured over the top about 20 mins. before it comes out of the oven and is a \"characteristic\" of this comfort food.",

The first bite was a little strange but as I continued to eat it the taste began to grow on me and I can honestly say I liked it. (My husband thought it was only okay). My only fault was with the sauce. Some have described it as \"custard\" but mine turned out more like scrambled eggs. If I were to make this again I think I would add a little more chutney.
