I'll save you the time here... \n     You definitely want to sautee the onions, it makes a big difference.  Combine the sauteed onions and leftover chicken in the food processor, it will improve the texture and help the patties stay together.  I used savory herb stuffing in place of the bread crumbs.  I also added fresh parmesan cheese, oregano, basil, and some garlic powder.  My mix was a little dry at this point so I added some chicken stock. \n     Here is the key...Mix all of the ingredients together EXCEPT FOR THE EGG!!!  TASTE IT!  If it doesn't taste good at this point, it won't taste any better when you cook it:) Season it until it tastes good, then add the eggs. I baked mine on a cookie sheet at 350 until they were golden brown(about 20 minutes).   \n     Thanks for a great recipe and thank you to all of the reviewers before me for their tweaks:)",

To enhance the flavor, I added a 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, a pinch of celery seed, and a dash or two of cayenne pepper to the chicken mixture. To add moisture to the croquettes, I decreased the breadcrumbs by a 1/2 cup and made a roux by melting a stick of butter and whisking in a 1/2 cup of flour, a 1/2 cup of milk, and a 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I whisked the mixture over low heat until thick and smooth and allowed it to cool for about 15 minutes. Then I added the cooled roux to the chicken mixture.  I covered the mixture and allowed it to set in the fridge for about two hours. Later I shaped the mixture into patties and browned them on both sides. These croquettes were much better than the first ones I made. Perhaps these suggestions will help",

I've never had croquettes before and found these a little dry (I ran out of eggs) but my husband liked them enough to take the leftovers to work for lunch. He only does this with leftovers he really really likes. I added some additional seasonings and parmesan cheese as well. I will definitely try these again only make sure I have enough eggs on hand first! Kudos to the reviewer who suggested using the mini chopper to process the chicken and onion. I did the same and it made working with the chicken really easy.",
