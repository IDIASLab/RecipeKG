Maybe that's because the texture is different than what the kids are used to (soft but top layer is crunchy). I picked this recipe since it has a bit of nutrition to it - peanut butter cereal. At least that's what I told myself as I wolfed them down. Note that these bars probably would not travel well since the top layer softens easily in warm weather.",
