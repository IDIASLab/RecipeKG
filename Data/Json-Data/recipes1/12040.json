I did however replace raspberry syrup with strawberry syrup and I added some of the matichino cherry juice as well. It was soooo good. I had a friend over who tried it with me and he liked it also. I now call it the love drink. he seemed to like me a little bit more after he drank it... then again he likes cheries and lemonade. very good recipe",
