Used apple butter in stead of sauce brown sugar instead of white reduced flour 1/4 cup and used 1/2 cup oatmeal. I don't have yeast packets so I used two teaspoons dry yeast (elevation 5300 feet). everyone likes both versions. Next time I make it I will use some of the other reviewers suggestions such as using some whole wheat and I'll add some dried cranberries.
