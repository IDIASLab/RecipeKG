I did a 2-cookie test and was able to correct this by crushing the dough before making additional cookies. I adjusted the recipe to make \"30\" and used a medium scoop to make very uniform cookies. I got about 3 dozen cookies from the recipe adjustment. I found that 10 minutes in my 350 gas oven was perfect for a chewy soft cookie. I used both a baking stone and lined baking sheet. I found both to be effective for a good final product. I took some cookies over for my mom to test. She said that it tasted like a \"professional\" cookie. I liked that. I will make this cookie again and add more oats (1 cup) and more shredded coconut (3/4 cup). (This is for a 30 cookie batch.)",
