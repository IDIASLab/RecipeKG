The larger your balls the less chocolate you're going to need! Just a heads up. I used crunchy peanut butter and wish I hadn't--it made it quite a bit harder to get the eggs to hold their shape. I also took other reviewers' advice and squished my rice krispies (which had about a 1/4c. cornflakes in too...didn't want to open another box & cornflakes were open). Another thing...I have been replacing half of our real sugar with fake sugar for a long time now so this candy with its full amount of powdered sugar was almost too rich for me. I'm going to do something about that next time but I'm not going to just omit the sugar because the recipe really NEEDS the powder there to help make the PB workable. Might just change out for Splenda or maybe use a sugar-free PB (assuming I can find a decent brand bleh). I'd recommend this tasty recipe to anyone!",
