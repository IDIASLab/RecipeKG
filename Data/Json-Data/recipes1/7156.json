I doubled the chocolate at other's suggestion and felt the chocolate-ness of it was perfect. I also substituted one cup of brown sugar for one of the cups of white sugar. As the other Texas Brownie (cake) suggests cinnamon I a tsp of cinnamon to this recipe. I also used the frosting recipe from Texas Brownies I. I am very happy with the finished product but again must stress that this is not a Brownie - it is a moist dense chocolate cake.",
