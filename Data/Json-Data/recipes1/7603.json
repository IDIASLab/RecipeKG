In the future I will cut back on the sugar by half in both the sweet potato mixture and the strerusel topping or maybe add more sweet potatoes. My dad is a diabetic so I used Splenda (brown and white) in this recipe without a problem. As a personal touch rather than have all of the streusel on the top I layered the sweet potatoes and streusel twice. This really helped distribute the streusel's crunch and flavor throughout the whole casserole not just the top. This recipe will now be my first choice for a sweet potato casserole recipe. Thanks!!",

I also didn't have any orange zest or coconut so they were left out. It also helps if you really read the recipe. The ingredients for the topping were suppose to be set aside but I didn't read far enough to \"set aside\" and added it to the mashed sweet potatoes. So I had that plus the rest of the ingredients. I did want that good topping so just used about 1/2 c of br. sugar with some chopped pecans. Even with my goofs it was still a hit. It wasn't over powering with sweetness. I used Splenda brown sugar combination with real sugar.",
