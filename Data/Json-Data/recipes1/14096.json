All you need is a few beaten eggs, and some itailan flavored bread crumbs with a little garlic powder mixed in. First dip the mozz. sticks in the egg mixture then the italian bread crumbs, then back in the egg mixture then back in the bread crumb mixture. Make sure they are completely coated. The oil shouldn't be any hotter then 350 degrees, then put the sticks in the oil for just about a minute, just until they float up to the top of the surface, and they're done! You can also use the same procedure with a block of mozz. Just don't cut the block any thicker then 1/4 inch. I hope this helps.",

                "reviewBody": "These were delicious and not hard to make. My minor improvisations included: cutting the cheese sticks in half (so my 8 became 16) and using plain bread crumbs with about 2 tsps mixed Italian seasoning. I also followed the advice of several reviewers: First, I combined the flour/starch mixture with the breadcrumbs. It was a huge time-saver and didn't seem to impact the end result. I also tried both double & triple coating and found that a double coat was sufficient for my taste. When the batter got a little clumpy, I simply moulded the clumps around the cheese for a slightly thicker coat. This part was a little messy, but other than that, it wasn't too bad. I coated all of the sticks before frying and set them aside on a plate. This turned out to be great advice because the frying really only takes about 30 seconds, and if you turn your back for too long, the sticks will burn. I did not have any problem with cheese leaking out, and the end result was truly restaurant quality. I will definitely make this recipe again!",

This was SUPER! First to make it easy and to make sure they \"looked\" like cheese sticks-shape-wise, I used Sargento Mozarella sticks, I unwrapped each and cut in half. I had 3 separate bowls setup w/ mixtures as described. I dipped each moz stick in egg mix, then flour mix, then egg mix, then bread crumb mix-making sure they were coated well. Then I put in oil. NOT ONE leaked!! I had to watch these little suckers cause they brown really fast! I let them cool a few minutes and served with little cups of pizza sauce for dipping. My 4 kids and hubby ADORED them and can't get enough. Considering these cost alot on dinners out--they are a KEEPER! WORD OF ADVICE: Use latex gloves to keep hands clean, this can get messy, and if making more than a dozen the mixes get goopy, so for large batches have extra mixes ready! otherwise..would give 10 stars if I could! THANKS SO MUCH!",

Here is what I do: Cut the cheese sticks in half this makes them easier to work with. Mix the flour with the bread crumbs and nix the cornstarch, dip the cheese in plain flour first to help the egg stick, then dip in crumbs, eggs again, then again in breadcrumbs/flour mix you will have a nice thick coating on them. Place them on a baking sheet covered in wax paper as you assemble them, then when you finish place the the tray in the freezer for about 30 minutes! (This is KEY! This keeps the cheese from melting the second it hits the oil and allows the coating to get crisp first) The recipe is pretty good as is, but if you make them as stated they will turn out a big mess!",
