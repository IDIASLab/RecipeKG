I used 2 cans of veg beef soup and 2 cans of cream of mushroom.I did not add salt - there is enough in the soup.Then I let it simmer a bit on the stove while I rolled the dough - I used a top and bottom crust.It looked better when serving and was also easier to serve.I did turn the oven up to 375 about 15 minutes before it was done. It turned out GREAT.Thank you for sharing your recipe we will have this again. I made this again but added some frozen peas and frozen corn and I liked it much better.",

Easy dish to prepare but very impressive.  Thanks for submitting it Tracy.",

But I forged ahead and made the filling with the ingredients listed. I put the filling in a lasagna pan and baked for about 35 minutes. Then I made a batter using about 3 cups of biscuit mix and skim milk. I removed the filling from the oven and spooned the batter on top. I returned it to the oven and raised the temp to 425 degrees and baked until lightly browned (about 15-20 min). Will make again.",

Also browned the beef & onion with fresh garlic. Added frozen peas at end. Instead of 2 pie plates I used a deep 9x13 casserole & just placed a pie crust on top. I thought it was fine with just the top crust. Froze the leftovers & thought the reheated leftovers tasted just a good or better! This would be a good recipe to make ahead and freeze.",
