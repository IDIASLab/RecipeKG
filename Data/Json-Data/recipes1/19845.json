Maybe I should have realized it with the pina colada part but I was hoping that the flavors would compliment each other somehow. It makes a lot of sauce so I quickly made some egg noodles to mix in. I would recommend some rice or couscous instead--maybe some grilled fruit. Just remember it's very sweet and I personally didn't even taste the jalapenos.",
