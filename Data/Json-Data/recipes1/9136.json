I have never had a problem. Shortbread should be slightly cooled- mine usually goes from the oven to the freezer and sits for about ten minutes before I pour on the caramel. It will not ruin the shortbread, I promise.\nI use dark chocolate instead of milk to level off the sweetness of the caramel a bit. I microwave the chocolate exactly as written, but add a tablespoon of butter. This absorbs into and smooths out the chocolate much better than milk.\n\nFinally, cut squares while chocolate is still just slightly soft with a heated knife. (I run mine under very hot water then dry it off). \nThese are not difficult, it just takes time to get to the finished product.\nBon Appetit!",

It should say to let the shortbread cool quite a bit before putting on the caramel. I let mine cool for 5-10 minutes and then poured on the hot caramel and it all sunk into a big puddle in the middle. That batch had to be scrapped and another made.  It turned out fine as I let the shortbread cool overnight.  I found them easy to cut as I cut them when the chocolate was still soft. The cookie did crumble a bit, but that was fine. Very yummy, just like what I used to get in London.",

I sort of wish I had kept a few for myself, although it's better for my waistline that I didn't. :) They were very easy and were delicious. I made a few changes based upon the reviews here. After I baked the crust, I poked holes in it with a fork and let it cool completely. I cooked the caramel over a lower heat and cooked it to the firm ball stage on my candy thermometer. I let that layer cool completely. I melted the chocolate with a little evaporated skim milk to keep it from getting too hard when it set up, and it was perfect. I tried cutting these when it wasn't cold and the cookies crumbled. I put it in the freezer for a bit and then tried to cut it again and the cookies were perfect. Everything came out wonderfully and I'll definately make these again.",

I greased and floured a 9x9 pan and they came out looking just like the picture. It is those of you that used a larger pan that...they came out too thin. I poked holes in the raw shortbread and then cooked for the time stated...then let it cool for only about 10 minutes....then added the carmel mixture (I did add a little extra milk)...let it set up well and then melted the chocolate with a little bit of half and half. I put it in the fridge for about a half hour...scored them and then let them sit in the pan...in the fridge all night. I cut them this morning and all I can say is...WOW!!!! They are incredible!!! The shortbread was prefect...the carmel was nice and thick yet very smooth....no hard in the least and the chocolate just melts in your mouth. It definitely taste similar to a twix bar but so, so much better. Try these....you will be so glad that you did!",

First of all, it is really easy to scorch the caramel filling - you have to stir both constantly and rapidly to avoid that - Because of that I burned my hand so badly it blistered.  The other problem with it is that the shortbread tends to fall off of the rest of the bar, making it very messy to eat or serve.

You're going to be tempted to put the pan in the fridge to \"set\" the caramel but I've found (after doing this a couple of times) that it makes the crust more crumbly and causes them to taste a bit stale even. Be patient - the caramel will set on its own.  Also, be sure to melt your MILK chocolate chips in a double boiler as they don't melt quite the same as semi-sweet in the microwave I've found.  Definitely cut them small - extremely rich.  Love these - make them all the time!",

The bottom crust is really easy to make in the food processor; just process into coarse crumbs.  The caramel is very good, but you need to watch it the whole time and use low heat.  I also found that the recipe is better if you cool the shortbread before putting in the caramel.  I only cooled these till the caramel was stiff, so the  melted chocolate ran over the sides of the bars, making them more like twix.  Oh, and be sure to run a knife around the pan before trying to get them out.  Happy cooking and eating!",

I was able to salvage it but IF I were making this again (which I doubt) I would have used a double boiler to make the caramel. When I melted the chocolate chips it turned into a fudgy texture making it clumpy to spread on the caramel. I have not removed them from the pan except a small piece to taste but the crust crumbled into my hand. While it was tasty these are VERY messy both to make and eat. I don't think I'd bother with these again.",
