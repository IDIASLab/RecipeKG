I usually make half of the recipe in a pie pan, which means half the phyllo dough, and I fold over all the edges to make a strange looking little tart thing. Strange, but delicious! I only use egg whites and not a whole egg, and I use light cream cheese. I usually top half with fresh chopped strawberries and the other half with raspberries/blackberries and blueberries, so people can choose whichever they like better. And I use spray Crisco butter instead of brushing the sheets with butter, much faster and lighter this way! I top it with powdered sugar after it's finished baking. Mmm!",

I made my own apple filling and I used about half the cream cheese and it was fine. I also spread a bit of melted butter on top of the pie before baking and sprinkled it with suger and cinnamon to make a nice taste. Next time I will probably sprinkle this mixture in between some of the layers of the crust too to make it a little more flavorful. On the whole tasty and unique but not amazing.",
