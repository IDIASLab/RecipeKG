I resisted the urge to add egg yolks as I usually do, basically as an experiment, and I was pleasantly surprised! This is some creamy ice cream! And what an unusual flavor--not quite banana, not quite citrus, but a recognizable, delicious blend of the two. With no cooked custard involved, this was a snap to make.  I made this in six 1's in order to fit my Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker, adding an extra half banana, and used 2 parts cream to 1 part half and half.  To ensure the best results, once mixed, refrigerate for several hours before churning. I'm so glad I tried this!",

I made this as six twos and still had a little bit too much for my smaller ice cream freezer so I just poured the rest into a plastic container with a lid and stuck it in the freezer. Both batches turned out great. Also the juice from the oranges and lemons combined to make about 6 oz. of juice. So if I'm really short on time I can buy fresh juice at the grocery store instead of squeezing my own. Thanks for a yummy new recipe!",

I wanted to make strawberry ice cream so I pureed 2 lbs of strawberries in my blender and did 3 Fours i.e. 4 cups each - milk 1/2 & 1/2 and sugar and then added the pureed strawberries to the mix. It was perfect and fed 17 people. If everyone would have taken the same amount it would have fed 15 people easy. Great easy recipe and a real crowd pleaser.",
