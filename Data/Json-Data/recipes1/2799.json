The apples will sweeten it naturally. I typically double the apples. Add walnutes or other nuts if you want a little change as well. This relish is also great with vanilla ice cream (warm the relish a tad). Almost like a pie/crumble without the crust!",

This recipe does however make the basis for a terrific cranberry relish. I added sugar a little bit at a time to taste - probably more than 1/2 cup reduced the vinegar by half left out the cinnamon and cloves because I was looking for an unspiced relish. I chopped the apple because I wanted the different fruits to be of similar size. Crushed some of the apples at the end which made the sauce nice and thick. With these changes everyone loved it - especially on top of pumpkin waffles or oatmeal.",

It\u2019s appropriately named because without the addition of sugar, it is tart.  And that suits me fine, because ordinary cranberry sauce is typically made with a boatload of sugar and is just too sweet for me.  I don\u2019t eat enough raisins to justify keeping regular and golden on hand, so today, I went with the regular style.  I used a Gala apple which I think has tough skin, so I did peel it, and then cut the apple slices in half, so they\u2019d be more in proportion with the cranberries.  Cooking with OJ is a good choice, and its flavor is infused into the berries.  I added 1 tablespoon of the red wine vinegar, stirred and tasted, and it tasted fine, so I stopped there.  We eat cranberry sauce year round, and this is one that I\u2019ll be making again.  Today, all of it went into the freezer for our Thanksgiving dinner.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Lipo, it\u2019s a keeper.",
