I also needed to use @1/8 cup more flour. The dough was still really sticky but the biscuits rose nicely in the oven and had a pretty light consistency. Don't overmix or you will end up with hockey pucks! I used a 4 cheese mexican blend and it gave them a nice flavor. I will make these again and again-easy and great flavor. Thanks!",

As an \"avid baker\"  who has not been to culinary school but bakes my own breads everyday, the key to any biscuit recipe is not to over mix them, otherwise you get the glutens going and they will be dense and hard--just mix enough to blend the ingredients and don't over handle the dough.  The only change I made was to add some more garlic and I use whatever cheeses I have available---they are always awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!  Oh, and if you use parchment paper on your pans, the biscuits won't stick!",

Also, the cheese was a finely shredded Mexican cheese blend, not just cheddar.  I think they'd be even better if you added some grated cheese, but also some small cubes of cheese so there'd be some really cheesy spots.  I can't figure out though why you need a full 1/4 cup of butter to brush on top, I used less than half and the biscuits were still soaked!",

I think that had something to do with the temperature being so high which baked the outside but didn't give it enough time to bake the inside. Next time I'm going to try baking these at 400 instead of 450 for around 17 minutes. UPDATE: I reheated these a couple of days later on 350 for 5-10 minutes and they were absolutely perfect. My mom and brothers all thought they tasted exactly like the buscuits from Red Lobster. If I can get the heated through the right amount the first time I'd say these are definitely a 5 out of 5.",

I served these with Easy Tortellini Soup which is also from this site. The boys thought they were GREAT--they used a lot of them to sop up the soup from their bowls. Next time I think I'd like to make them even more garlic-y and add either fresh minced garlic or a teaspoon of garlic powder into the biscuit batter.",

I was out, so I went with this one, and I think its better.  But, I did doctor it up some after reading the reviews.  To the dry mix -- I added some garlic powder, more salt, double the baking powder, about a 1 1/2 cups of cheese, and some fresh ground black pepper.  For the butter topping -- about half the amount of butter, double the garlic, and added some parmesan and parsley.  I also used Pam on the baking sheet, since many complained of the biscuits sticking.  Also, in my oven (and I used a thermometer) they took more like 15-20 minutes than the called for 12-15.  Happy biscuit eatin'!  Had with some ham and bean soup.  Yes!",
