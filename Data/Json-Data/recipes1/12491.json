The second time I made this I used raspberry jalapeno persevere and it was even better. I can't give this 5 stars though because of the cooking directions. If you grill your strip on a high grill for 10 mins you'll have a hunk of carbon. You want to caramelize the sugars not burn them. I did a medium direct grill for 6 minutes a side (starting with a hot grill to sear) the strips came out perfect medium. The second time I did a high indirect for 6 minutes a side and the outside was a bit crisp and the inside was pinker. Very juicy char broil. I'll do the indirect method again.",
