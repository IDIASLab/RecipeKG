Because my family is vegan, I used soy milk and marshmallow \"fluff\" instead of the mini-marshmallows (the Wal-Mart brand of fluff doesn't contain gelatin like marshmallows do) and it still came out perfect. I also drizzled some melted peanut butter on top after the pie cooled and it looked and tasted great. Thanks for this recipe, it is now a family favorite!",

It was the only pie at Thanksgiving that disappeared with absolutely no left overs.  I highly recommend this pie to all the chocolate lovers!!!!",
