I sauteed the onion with some fresh minced garlic in olive oil rather than vegetable oil, and eliminated the garlic powder. In addition to the oregano I added 1/2 tsp. of cumin. Working with what I had, I cooked 1/2 cup of white long grain rice in chicken broth, then added it to the remaining ingredients to simmer awhile. This essentially amounted to changing the proportions of rice to beans, allowing for more beans, and less rice.  Finally, I used chopped, fresh Roma tomatoes rather than the stewed, though  that didn't necessarily make it any better--I was just working with what I had.  This was SO tasty, and was the perfect side dish for \"Whit's Chicken Enchiladas,\" also from this site.",
