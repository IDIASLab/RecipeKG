I make it yesterday for my boyfriend's birthday... it made a 3-layer cake as the recipe stated and it was a very dense cake.....although moist. The flavour was OK but I feel that it needed more of the white chocolate flavour in the cake itself. The icing was very sweet and also needed more of the white chocolate flavour and a way to cut the almost overpowering sweetness. If I were to make this recipe again I would downsize it to a 2-layer cake... the 3-layer was ungainly to handle and with the three layers too big a slice for people even sliced very thin which was dicfficult to do. Maybe a tube or bundt pan plus cupcakes would be better instead of three layers??? The icing recipe made a lot of icing and I have a bunch left over and I used a lot on the cake too! We love icing! The cake goes well with fresh strawberries but as I discovered yesterday do not put sliced fresh strawberries between the layers as they cause the cake to slide around! I fed 10 people and have a big chunk leftover but a lot of the pieces had to be thrown out as people could not eat that much cake! Live and learn! I think I might try this one again but on a smaller scale as not to waste these delicious and expensive ingredients!",

It was not any thing like I thought it would be for advanced cooks it would be a fairly simple cake to make althought it was not quick. The cake itself was very dense and resembled a hummingbird cake and the icing tasted more like a cream cheese icing than a mixture of white chocolate and cream cheese. Also the recipe made way more than was needed for the cake.",
