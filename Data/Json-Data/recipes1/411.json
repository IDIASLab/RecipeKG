Unfortunately the dough was impossible to roll out and I had to take extra time I didn't really have to roll dough into individual balls and press with a glass to flatten. I think due to this extra handling the cookies turned out tougher than they should be. The biscochitos recipe I had made in the past resulted in very buttery fine-textured cookies- these were hard and crumbly. I took care not to over-bake and followed the recipe to a \"T\". Also it should be noted that this recipe makes FAR more than 3 dozen cookies. I think I ended up with 6 dozen cookies or more. I do not recommend using this recipe.",

Lovely texture and my 3 y/o loved them and he's very picky.",
