It was a little time consuming layering out the fettucine but once you get the hang of it it goes at a better pace. It can be prepared in advance which is ideal just come home and throw it in the oven. I used it as a main course to serve to dinner guests with a caesar salad and Italian bread on the side. Everyone loved it and was satiated at the end of the meal. I would make this again perhaps vary it up a little by throwing in some garlic and maybe even try a bit of spinach and feta as well. I would definately recommend this recipe to others.",
