My husband loved them but I thought the vinegar gave them a funny twang.  The next time I made them I used plain milk.  I still got rave reviews, but still not perfect.  I think that I put in too much baking soda.  I calls for only an eighth of a teaspoon.  I did'nt have that size so I just put in half of a fourth teaspoon.  It makes them rise, and impresses all my family an friends, but I'm going after that good fluffy buscuit that is also a little chewy.  If you put in too much soda they get a little too cakey. Next time I make them, I am going to get the buttermilk, make sure I only use 1/8 tsp soda, and I'm sure they will be great.  They really were easy to make.  My husband sd they tasted just like his Mom used to make, and my BIL said they were the best biscuits he ever ate.  Granted those two would eat paint off table legs, it was good eough for me.

Light and fluffy and a unique taste. We all raved about them. I also substituted whole milk and vinegar. 1 T of vinegar in the milk and let it sit until it starts to thicken. Yum.
