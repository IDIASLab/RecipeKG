I used 1 large onion and 2 green onions which was the perfect ratio. I also consider this pico and not salsa which is no biggie. I'm going to blend some of the tomatoes for a more salsa consistency next time which means I'll have to cut back on the jalapeno juice but I still think it will be good. Great recipe with a couple of small tweaks!",
