I made the syrup and then poured it over the peaches that were raw packed into sterile jars. Then processed in a hot water bath for 25 minutes per pint. This seemed to be so much easier to me. The flavor was outstanding....not too strong...not to mild. Thanks for sharing this one!",

I made it during Summer 2001 with fresh peaches and let them sit a while in the spices using them this past holiday season for our Thanksgiving table on the Turkey tray and then again around the Cranberry jello mold. Around Xmas and a few times this winter I made Gingerbread pancakes as a special breakfast treat. I opened up a jar of my canned spiced peaches and put them in the blender to just cut them up for better mixing with the spices. I then used the cut spiced peaches and the \" spices juice\" mixture(instead of maple syrup) over the gingerbread pancakes. It was sooo good! Thank you Donna and thanks to all of your relatives in Georgia! We will enjoy this recipe and the wonderful combinations we've created for years to come here in the Shenandoah Valley!",

I tried this recipe for my first ever attempt at canning. I cut the recipe in half and it turned out great. The jars look so pretty I'm planning to give some away in holiday gift baskets. I did end up with extra cooked peaches and not enough of the syrup to cover them in jars. Not such a bad thing because I got to taste the peaches and they are incredible! The canning process wasn't as intimidating as I'd thought so I'll certainly make these peaches again!",
