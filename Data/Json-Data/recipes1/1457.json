I think I must have taken the difections too literally, because I folded the pudding mix right into the cool whip, which made it all gritty; it was like having granulated sugar all through the frosting!  I must say that I'm the only one in the house who thought that, though; my husband and daughter gobbled it up.  I frosted two cakes separately; one with this frosting and one with a cream cheese frosting that I added some pineapple and orange extract to, and I thought that was delicious!  The cake itself was to die for, and I'm definitely making it again.  I did vary it slightly by adding a little grated orange peel to the cake, which gave it a little more orange flavor.  Yummy!  I'd really like to try this as a bundt cake with an orange glaze drizzled over it!",

I made it in a 9 x 13\" pan, due to the fact that someone mentioned that the layer version might slide, and I had to travel with it.  It was moist, and the flavor was great.  I did make the pudding first and did not add the dry mix to the whipped topping, so thank you to the reviewer for the advice.\n\nAdditionally, the stores are now selling a \"reduced sugar\" yellow and chocolate mix.  I used the yellow reduced sugar mix, and it was great.  I also used fat-free, sugar-free vanilla pudding and light whipped topping.  I don't think anyone eating it had any idea, either!",

It's not available in all stores, but if you can find it the cake tastes even more fabulous. (If using the orange cake mix, omit the orange extract from the recipe). Either way though..this cake is perfect for summer and is to die for. Definitely one to take to family functions or potlucks..you will get rave reviews and tons of compliments. Be prepared to share the recipe, because everyone will be asking for it :)",

I was afraid I didn't have enough icing for 3 layers, but it worked wonderfully and wasn't too sweet!\nI will say the instructions aren't very clear when making the frosting.  I learned the hard way.  Don't make the pudding to fold into the whipped topping & pineapple.  Just fold in the pudding mix.  I had to end up with 1 batch of liquid icing to figure that out :)",
