Heat on med-high until melted then turn down to warm.  dip the grahams into the sugar and they stick and dry within seconds.

I remember when I was a kid having such a hard time getting the house to stand up or the roof to stay on etc. No problems with this one! In fact our house has a steep A-frame roof and we covered the entire roof with overlapping Necco wafer shingles. They are HEAVY and we put them on with the roof already in place. This icing held it all on with zero slippage. I was very impressed. It tastes awful but we primarily just make our gingerbread house for decorative purposes so this is not an issue for us.",

I added the cream of tarter to the egg whites and beat them together, then beat in the sugar and 1/4 tsp vanilla.  If your icing is runny and a smaller yield it is because you haven't beaten it long enough.  I beat it for 7 minutes.   I used this for icing cookies, so I  thinned it with water-- a way to tell if it is the proper consistency is when it is the mark left from a knife dragged through it disappears within 5-10 seconds.  It pipes well, even just using a baggie with a hole in the corner.  I will definitely make it again.",

Once I overcame the horror of this catastrophe, I deftly switched to a wooden spoon and my trusty bicep-tricep tag team to finish the job. I needed to add the juice of one fresh lemon to add enough moisture to be able to reach a decent consistency. Not a great recipe, but thanks for the new muscle training regimen.",
