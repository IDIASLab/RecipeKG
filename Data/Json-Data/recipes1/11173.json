Seemed simple enough! I cut the recipe in half b/c I wasn't even hungry and reading other reviews they all said \"not gourmet but good.\" Unfortunately I didn't find this comforting or all that good. I did add a little broccoli and used a can of crm of chic and added a little milk for \"creaminess\" but I found this to be pretty bad. I tried to pawn this off to my daughter for dinner (she eats almost everything) and she would hardly touch it. Luckily it didn't make much as I halved the recipe so I threw it away and to my dismay had to find something new for dinner. Sorry.",
