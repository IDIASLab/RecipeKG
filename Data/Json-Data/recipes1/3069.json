To avoid having to baste it constantly, I reduced the baste in a saucepan over medium heat until it thickened. I ended up with a glaze that went on and stayed on. One additional application of the glaze mid-way through cooking was all that was required. Also, if you've got the time, the pork can be made fabulously moist by setting the oven temperature at only 180 F. It will take about 3.5 hours for the internal temperature of the roast to reach 160 F (at which point its perfectly cooked), but it's worth it.",

The 2nd time I made it, I ran out of real maple syrup, so used 1/2 c real, 1/2 c pancake syrup and it was very sweet, so I added about 1 tablespoon of tabasco sauce.  Oh baby, it remained sweet but had a subtle kick, I have since added tabasco every time I've made it, even though I use only real maple syrup, really keeps it from being overpoweringly sweet.  The other thing I've done is to add in two loaf pans filled with carrots, onions, potatoes, and yams (cut into 1\" chunks).  I then made up another batch of the glaze and dumped 1/2 over each pan stirred to coat evenly and covered with foil, I stirred them when before serving.  It was a heavenly companion to the roast.  I cook it in a round glass pan that barely fits the roast, this keeps the glaze from being just a burnt on goop at the end of cooking, so I have some glaze remaining to drizzle over the slices.",

Then dusted the loin on both sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion granules. Placed the loin in the crock pot and then covered with the remaining glaze. Then when I returned home from church I ladled some of the glaze off and reduced it to make a gravy. I served this with mashed potatoes, corn and green beans. Delicious gravy! The pork came out very tender. Total time in the crockpot on high was 4.5 hours and there was not a hint of pink. Also, the maple syrup gave the loin a beautiful golden look without having to brown it first. I made the glaze the night before, placed in the fridge, so all I had to do before church was throw everything in the crock pot together, so easy! I made the glaze exactly to recipe and wouldn't change a thing! This is definitely going to be a keeper in our house; I can't wait to make this for company!",
