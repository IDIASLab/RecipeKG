Hope you enjoy these tofu Sloppy Joes as much as we did! This recipe yields a lot of Sloppy Joe mix and is even better the next day. I serve these with a side of fresh corn on the cob and a salad.",

Even my fussy 8yo ate it. \n\nI made a few changes: I eliminated the fake ground beef, and increased the tofu to 1 \u00bd lbs. (could maybe even have done a full 2 lbs.) plus 1 cup chopped walnuts. I also reduced the dijon mustard by almost half. We got two meals for 4 out of this. A family hit, we will make it again, thanks! :D",
