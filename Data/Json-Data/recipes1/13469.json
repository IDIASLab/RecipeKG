While that was going I started browning my ground beef and sweet italian sausage\nwith my chopped onion and basil, italian seasoning, red peppers and seasoning salt. Then I cooked my fresh mushrooms in white wine until wine reduced by two teaspoons. When my tomatoes and garlic were ready, I put them in electric chopper with a little wine, basil, oregano, italian seasoning , tomatoe paste, and water.\nThen I added the tomatoe mixture to my meat that I had drained of fat. I added my mushrooms and fresh parsley and parm cheese. I let it simmer for 1 1/2 hrs stirring every 15min or so. Then I poured over my pasta Top my dish with a little jack and parma cheese and fresh black pepper and garlic seasoning blend. Made garlic cheese bread\nThen we threw down eating this one up!!!!!.",

I also added 1/2 red bell pepper chopped in food processor (gives it a sweetness so you don't need sugar) and 1/4 tsp. cayenne. I went with 1 head of garlic cloves instead of garlic powder. To me this tasted like high end jarred sauce which is what my 3 young kids like something simple (and I don't like Prego or Ragu). This is a recipe we'll add to our recipe book. Thanks!",

Very good!",

If I made this again I would probably reduce the herbs especially the oregano and add a couple tablespoons of sugar to mellow out the sauce. I also thought this was a little too meaty. I like meat sauce as much as the next gal but this was just a little too much meat for the amount of sauce. I would cut the meat down to 1/2 lb. Overall a decent sauce but I think I will keep looking for something a little tastier.",
