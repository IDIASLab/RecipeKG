Next time I will try this with cashews rather than walnuts! I used pulverize graham crackers because I had no puffed rice and because I think that vanilla dominates the subtle flavor of the dates I used 2 tbs of Marsala wine (which by the way tastes great just eating dates and sipping the wine). I also left off the coconut and rolled in powdered sugar. I took the advice of another reviewer and used an ice water test to verify what \"very thick\" was. This stage in cooking just happened to be when my least dominant hand couldn't stir the pot any longer. Great recipe!",
