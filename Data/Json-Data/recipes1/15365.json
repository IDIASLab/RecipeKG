After simmering and realizing it wasn't going to tame out I drained the liquid from the chunks threw it out and added apple juice the seasonings (again) and 3/4 cup sugar and simmered some more. The fruit is still super pungent. I'm hoping it'll mellow out in the next 48 hrs before Thanksgiving! I'd hate to waste all those persimmons! If you're going to try the recipe start with 1/2 the cider vinegar and go from there. Also this recipe makes alot.",

I didn't use raisins or chile peppers; instead put in some cumin and Southwestern seasoning and powdered ginger (a key ingredient in many Indian chutneys). It made the kitchen smell terrific and everyone loved the final product. We had it with steak and parmesan mashed potatoes.",
