When cooking the onions add 2-3 cloves (or to taste) of crushed garlic and use a good olive oil not vegetable oil. Use a good smoked bacon and you might want to increase it by 25-50%. Add salt pepper parsley and crushed red pepper to egg mixture before you add to bacon onions and mushrooms. Speaking of...I used sliced baby bella mushrooms. Okay...I think that is it. Good luck.",

One thing to improve upon would be when adding the egg mixture to the pan. My eggs cooked and made the sauce not very smooth. It would probably be better to add the sauce to the pan and turn off the heat or turn to low to prevent the eggs from hardening and forming clumps The hot pasta should also cook the eggs when mixing. This will be something to fine tune when I make it again.",

The taste wasn't horrible it just wasn't uber yummy and not what Hubby had expected at all in the flavor department. I'm going to keep looking for a better recipe. BTW The instructions are incomplete and ought to be review. If it weren't for other reviews by users I wouldn't have known when to add the parsley and red pepper.",

Be warned when reducing the recipe - remove the pan from the heat before stirring in the egg/cream mixture. The eggs in the mixture will coddle quickly. I'm sure this wouldn't be the case if making the full recipe amount but the smaller amount heats up quickly. I used whole wheat spaghetti as my pasta. I enjoyed this even more as leftovers the following day. Thanks for a terrific recipe!",
