Unless you LOVE Velveeta, I would highly recommend using half cheddar cheese (otherwise your soup will taste more like Velveeta cheese dip). I always use 1 pound of velveeta and 1/2 - 3/4 pounds of cheddar and I always end up with restaurant quality soup. Also, remember to constantly stir the milk mixture \"until it thickens\" and you will have a nice and smooth, thickened soup. I do not use white pepper but put in a dash of regular pepper. Substituting a good portion of the velveeta with cheddar makes a great tasting, quality soup. My family loves it - even my three kids. I rate this 5 stars with the addition of cheddar. If I rated this using all Velveeta then the rating would have been 1 star.",

Just keep plugging along ;).  3) You will think that you're adding an ungodly amount of cheese, but the recipe can handle it.  It's not overly cheesy.  \n\nExcellent!",

I did make some changes that I believe were improvements - butter rather than margarine for its superior flavor, fresh broccoli rather than frozen (cooked easily and lickety-split in the microwave) a clove of garlic and a mix of 2/3 Velveeta and 1/3 Cheddar.  I  cooked the broccoli in advance and set it aside.  Sweated the onion in butter, added the garlic, then the broth and milk. Once it thickened just a little I lowered the heat and slowly stirred in the cheeses, then gently stirred in the broccoli.  Excellent soup - creamy, rich and satisfying. Since we're leaving town again, our guests were only too happy to have the leftovers.",

I also used real cheddar, and a bit of pepperjack cheese, to give it a little pep.  A lot of people don't like using real cheese because they think it is grainy, but if you cook it properly, it is just as smooth, and tastes better.\n\nWhen making the rue (after sauteing the onions and garlic), slowly whisk in the flour, to make a smooth rue.  Them temper it (aka, slowly add a LITTLE bit of milk at a time) until incorporated.  Then cook over a very ow heat for about 15-20 minutes until thick.  After you add the milk mixture to the broccoli, take it off the heat and slowly add you cheese, never letting it boil.  Super smooth, creamy, and REAL.",
