I also added about 1/4 cup of chopped red bell peppers and 1 chopped green onion and cooked that with the bacon in a little butter for a minute and then added and cooked the kale for about another 5 minutes. I also used a 4 cheese mexican blend because I didn't have the other kind on hand. We will definately make this again!",
