This cake is so light with lovely strong chocolate taste which hit me at the very end. Since I don't keep self rising flour on hand I used 1 cup All-Purpose flour plus 1 1/2 tsps baking powder and 1/8 tsp salt. I used raspberry jam cause that's what I had on hand (plus it's my favourite flavour) and I only made half the frosting recipe which turned out to be just enough. It didn't come out too sweet because of that but the surprise in the middle was very nice to bite into. Thanks for the great idea and recipe!",

However, I have no idea what the consistency for that should be, so perhaps it was supposed to be dry and I made it wrong.  \nNeeded to add about a quarter cup extra water at the end, as the recipe acknowledges.\nIcing in the picture is almost runny, (which could be because the 'bun' is still hot, in which case, they ignored their own directions to allow it to cool), my icing was almost as thick as for an oreo, and I used less icing sugar than it called for.\nI used all margarine, which should have way more moisture than the optional butter.\n\nThe taste is bland, and the only reason this doesn't get a 1 is because the flavors go well together, and the presentation is neat.",

The second time I doubled all the ingredients mixed the cocoa powder in the flour rather than with hot water and used half a cup of milk half of fresh cream. Used strawberry jam instead of cherry and my own icing recipe. The texture and taste were improved. Really like its presentation that's why the three stars.
