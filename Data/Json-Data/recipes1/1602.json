I was a little bit worried because of the lack of flour but because of all the other positive reviews I thought I would give it a try. It smelled heavenly in the oven but about a half hour before it was supposed to be done it smelled burnt. When I looked smoke was pouring out of the oven! I pulled it out and even though it still seemed too moist I tried to turn it over onto a serving dish. What I ended up with was a huge... towering... blob. The outside looked like burnt jello greasy glisten and all. I have to admit I didn't want the cake to be a total waste of good ingredients so I picked out a relatively safe looking portion from the inside. It tasted only average nothing special. After it sat for a while the tast improved but I will not be making this again.",
