Instead of buttermilk I used two cups of plain yogurt and i replaced two tablespoons of butter with two tablespoons of apple sauce. I added half a cup of raisins which upped the sweetness. Chopped dates would probably work too. Like others I added brown sugar: a 1/4 cup. I also used a little more whole wheat flour and a little less white flour. Finally instead of an egg I used egg replacer. The mix was not extremely wet and i was worried the muffins would be a little dry but they werent at all!!!",
