Great served with sour cream, grated cheese and lime wedges to squirt the juice over the dish to taste.  If you really must have beans, serve them on the side.  This chili is the real deal.  My family begs me to make it.  Great recipe!",

They won't give me theirs, but this one has to be it because it tastes the same - float a little vinegar on top and go to town.  One caution though...this recipe takes longer to cook than indicated.  I slow cook mine for about 4 hours and add a cup of red wine after about 3 hours.  Then I use a mixer to shred the remaining beef that is still cubed.  This gets the texture just right and avoids the \"beef stew\" consistancy some people on this thread are getting.",

You can buy your roast and ask your butcher to give it a chili cut and he'll do it. This is easier and you don't have to worry that you're cutting it right. Chili cut is like hamburger, but it's a little more coarse.Thanks so much for this recipe!!!\r\n",

Imagine my surprise when I tasted what had been simmering for 4 hours on my stove top and discovered pile of beef in a tasteless broth. I had to make some changes. I added an additional 3 tablespoons of chili powder, and 2 more teaspoons cumin. I added cayenne pepper, onion powder, a pinch of dried basil, and two bay leaves. I also added another can of beef broth. I let it simmer another hour, and then refrigerated overnight (the bay leaves went into the refrigerator with them). The next day, I simmered it another hour before eating. If I had it on hand, I would have added another can of broth. In the end, it was good. However, I'm surprised how much additional seasoning I needed to add to make it good. Trust me, this recipe is bland as written.",
