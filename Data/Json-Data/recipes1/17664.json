                "reviewBody": "This is a good recipe for a mildly spicy breakfast casserole. The recipe doesn't specify whether the shredded potatoes should be frozen or fresh. I used frozen potatoes, but added them to the skillet with the onions and a little olive oil and browned them first. Once the onions were soft and the potatoes browned, I turned off the heat and I added the ham, and the chilies to the skillet as well. I seasoned this with a little salt and pepper then put into the prepared casserole dish. I only used a Mexican blend shredded cheese and layered this cheese evenly over the potato mixture. I then mixed the eggs, milk, sour cream, and the taco seasoning and poured it evenly over the cheese. Baked it in a bit higher oven (375 degrees F) for about 40 minutes or until the eggs were set and puffy. I didn't add any additional cheese to the top for my own personal preference. I think this casserole would be awesome with sausage or bacon in place of the ham too!  When I make it next time, I will definitley up the amount of taco seasoning in the egg mixture.",
