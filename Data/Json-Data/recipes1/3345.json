I did use cilantro instead of the epazote because I've never used it wasn't sure of the flavor and didn't want to take a chance on my family not liking it after all the work that goes into this lol. I followed the rest of it to a 't'. I do think it tastes even better the next day (I just mixed everything together in a tupperware instead of saving each layer seperately and it was yummy). I do not however agree with all here that this recipe is worth all the work. I have made some elaborate recipes which are worth all the work but I am sorry to say for us this is not one of them. I think it could be done with many shortcuts and have the same flavor. Will tinker with it and find an easier way to make it. But overall flavor deserves 4 stars!",

I used chicken broth instead of water and I used diced tomatoes instead of whole. I did not puree the tomatoes in a food processor. I used tortilla chips instead of corn tortillas and I also added a dollop of sour cream to the finished dish. I served this to 4 picky teens and they all had seconds!",
