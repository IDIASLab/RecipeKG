The problem came with the baking.  One reviewer noted that the baking time was excessive as her cake was done in 45'. I believe the problem with this recipe is not with the baking time but with the temperature. 350 degrees is too hot an oven for this delicate cake.  I plan to remake this recipe and bake it at 300 degrees. This recipe can be used in a variety of desserts, and I believe that modifying the baking conditions will resolve any problems.",

When my friend and I tried it it tasted like a normal yellow cake and had that same heavy texture. It also tasted a bit like egg. I would suggest from making other angel food cakes to try it without the egg yolks. Whoever gave this recipe five stars has never had a real angel food cake.",
