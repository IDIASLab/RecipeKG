I asked my husband what he thought could be added to make it more to his liking. So this is what he came up with: Keep basic recipe as is add 1 Tbs. parmesan cheese 1 Tbs. fine bread crumbs 1 mashed minced clove garlic 1 tsp. dried parsley. I guess we're just used to the traditional stuffed mushrooms but these with the pine nuts were really special. I served them the other night when we had a BBQ with another couple as a side dish to steak accompanied with a chopped tomato and cucumber salad. Six to a foil wrapped packet was perfect a little surprise to each plate....lot's of good comments thanks dipc1974 we now have two new foodies to follow Allrecipes.",
