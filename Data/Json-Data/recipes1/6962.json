Then instead of using a food processor, put the cream cheese in the blender with a Tbsp. of milk, blend, then add the prepared soup to the cream cheese mixture one cup at a time until pureed. I like my soup a little chunky so I leave a little bit of unpureed soup in the pot then I combine them. I used fresh tomatoes that I skinned and seeded. I had a ton of them this fall. mmmmmmmmmm what a great way to use them, in a nice creamy soup serve with a grilled cheese sandwich. An absolute Keeper. It froze pretty well too, it didn't curdle like most creamed soups, so I can eat it all winter long.",

We like eating healthy and with all the veggies in this there are some benefits however since he overindulges every time I am not sure how good it is for him. We love this soup and make it every other week at least and we always finish the entire pot. Thanks for a delicious soup.",

I also pureed the whole thing in the blender because my husband won't eat vegetable chunks. My husband (a die-hard vegetable hater) thought the soup was okay which is a victory!

The recipe instructs to cover and roast the tomato red pepper and garlic mixture for 25 minutes. When I took it out of the oven it wasn't even hot in the middle. What is the point in this step? Nothing is roasted just heated up. I am not a picky eater and I like all of the ingredients called for. For some reason I found they didn't blend well every flavour seemed too sharp especially the mushrooms celery and rosemary. I tried a bowl the next day but unfortunately the flavour did not get any better. Rather than discarding I will freeze the rest for the one that likes it.",
