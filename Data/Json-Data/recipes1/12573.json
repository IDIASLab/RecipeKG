For starters DON'T cook the bacon and onions together. I had the feeling this was a bad idea and I should have trusted my instincts. The bacon doesn't crisp up (because of the water that cooks out of the onions) and the onions burn. Better to render the bacon by itself then use the bacon drippings to saute the onions. Plus no need for the oil this way (which I didn't use anyway). Second this makes way more than four servings! And it was a bit dry; maybe the pasta amount should be cut in half? The flavors were okay but not great. My kids ate it though without complaint maybe because it was so bland. I wasn't what I would call a \"quick meal\" and considering the flavor outcome I would recommend a box of the \"helper\" stuff instead.",

I chopped up the bacon before frying it and poured off the bacon fat as I fried it so the bacon got nice and crisp. Setting the bacon aside I put a bit of the bacon grease back in and fried up the onions with 2 cloves of garlic. I then added the soup and bacon back in and added some oregano chilli powder and garlic powder. I saw someone comment that it could of used more bacon so I actually used an entire package (my only mistake). All that bacon made the meal a bit heavy in the stomach (too much fat!!)but did it taste great. My husband gave it four stars as well and wants it to be made more often so it was a hit. Very easy to make too. I would also suggest that after you fry the ongions in the pan drain off all the grease you can. And don't put as much bacon as I did unless you want a heart attack lol.",
