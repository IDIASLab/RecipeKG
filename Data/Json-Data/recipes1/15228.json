We pray for colder weather in California just so we can make this soup!  You can substitute additional diced tomatoes for the tomatillos. If you would like the soup to be spicier, you can add some red chili flakes or salsa. Serve with these toppings for people to choose from: limes, cilantro,  cheese, avocado, sour cream, and tortilla chips.",

One thing to remember is that the quality of the Salsa Verde (or tomatillos) is very important as it is perhaps the predominant flavor. Make sure to use a good quality salsa--that is, one you really enjoy on its own. I prefer Target's \"Archer Farms Salsa Verde\", which is about $3 for 24oz.",

I heated the spices in the oil before adding both cubed and ground chicken. I used the ground chicken for texture - more traditional chili style, and added a touch a cream.  MMmmmm.\n\nThanks to other reviews, I was ready with the corn starch to thicken it up so it wasn't as soupy. \n\nI would like to say I loved it - but, by time I made my way back to the table to have some, it was GONE.  I don't think it lasted 15 minutes!!  \n\nI WILL cook this again,  I would like to have more than just a sample spoon full...  ",

I also simmered it for an hour.  It is a nice change from the slow cooker taco soup that is also wonderful!\n\nI am adding this last sentence after reading a more recent review by someone else who added lime to the chili and felt that it made it bitter....if you read the recipe again you will see that they suggest lime slices as a garnish:)",

I add more beans and chicken to make it thicker and heartier and serve bowls of the chili with grated cheese, onions,  tomatoes and sour cream as toppings but without all the sour cream, it even meets weight watchers criteria. I've had trouble finding tomatillos  so I have substituted using green enchilada sauce or green salsa. Still SCRUMPTIOUS!   My husband has prepared this chili for camping trips.

Patted them down with Emeril's Southwestern Essence and lightly seared with onions and some bell pepper. 3. Poured in the chicken stock, two cans of Rotel Tomatoes w/ Lime & Cilantro and a large jar of La Victoria Salsa Verde and added the spices (plus a bay leaf). 4. Simmered the breast 40 minutes then pulled out and shredded.  5. Returned to pot and added beans & a large can of sweet corn.  6. Cooked the chili down several hours and added a couple of cubes of chicken broth and vegetable broth along the way with some water and cornstarch.  This is a GREAT, healthy chili with an interesting flavor which we all enjoyed and I will make again.  This is NOT a recipe I will share as good chili recipes are \"sacred\".  Ha!  ",

Because we\u2019re giving it away, I didn\u2019t add any of the suggested toppings, I just didn\u2019t have any in the house, but it was wonderful without any!
