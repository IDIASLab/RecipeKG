Although my all-time favorite rosemary focaccia recipe is the \"Acme Herb Slab\" this is an excellent substitute if you do not have hours/days to commit to the craft. It yields a soft bread with a lightly crisp crust and tender crumb. I added 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp black pepper along with double the fresh rosemary. It smelled wonderful in the oven and looked professional when baked. The uses of this bread are plenty...pizza crust, breadsticks, sandwich bread, etc. I work as a professional baker and am something of a bead snob, but I was impressed by the results of this recipe.:-)",

I made it with all purpose flour & had to add an additional 1/2 cup; I followed What A Dish's suggestion & proofed the yeast in the warm water & sugar then added the dry ingredients & oil; I sauteed 1/2 cup onions in butter & drizzled them over the shaped dough which I let rise in and baked in a large cast iron skillet. Next time I'll spread it out on a baking sheet because it was pretty thick. The taste was fantastic. Another reviewer suggested that the bread is bland but left out the parmesan. I would definitely add the parmesan as per the recipe--it enhances the subtle flavor of the bread and certainly make it appear even more appetizing (see the picture!)
