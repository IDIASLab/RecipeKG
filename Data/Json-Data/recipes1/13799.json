I used one and half cup of espresso (about 6-7 shots?) plus two cups of water.  I didn't have any beef broth or buillon, so to enhance flavor, I added fresh rosemary, thyme, some cajun seasoning, one plus cup of red wine, and about two tablespoon of soysauce.  I had to cook it for about four hours, and the meat was tender and ready to go.  Coffee seems to have given the meat a earthy, almost gamy flavor.  I served it at a small dinner party, all my friends thought it was amazing.",

I usually read all the reviews but didn't this time...I was just looking for a chuck roast recipe for which I had all the ingredients! Instead of using less coffee I used MORE because my coffee maker is 10 cups and I figured I'd just get a little more gravy. Reading the reviews later and hearing it was rather a strong coffee flavor it was a little scary since we don't drink coffee. I added 2 Lipton Onion Mushroom Soup Mix packets to balance out the coffee and some thick sliced potatoes and baby carrots to round out the dish. At the end the taste was DELLICIOUS! There was SO MUCH gravy however that after I removed the meat and vegetables thickened the gravy and added the sour cream I added some couscous to the gravy. I used 2 5.45 oz boxes (less the flavor packets of course) and while it was quite a bit thicker than we would have preferred it was absolutely wonderful! I think I'll make it again this weekend to take to my parent's home for Father's Day! Thanks for a winner Luella...",

I simmered it for 2.5 hrs & when I went to turn it over I tested it -- it was already past done & getting dry so 5 hrs would have been way too long! No one else complained of this. We couldn't eat it the night I cooked it so I put the broth in the frig separate from the meat. The next day the grease was in a firm layer on the top so I separated it off. When I made the gravy I just used a small portion of the grease (one reviewer said this recipe was too greasy). For me the gravy was very tasty but much too concentrated. I think that next time I will follow JIHI's recommendation to put in 2c less coffee & add 2c water. I rarely cook chuck roast because it is not a good cut & I don't have luck cooking roasts. However in spite of it already being a little dry I must say the meat was wonderfully tender & was excellent with the gravy.",
