Three carrots to serve 6-8 people?  I used a pound of baby carrots.  I also added a medium sweet onion, quartered and separated.  3.  The meat definitely needed a meat rub.  I use Lysander\u2019s\u2122 All Natural Meat Rub.  4.  To make the gravy, try using a can of Campbell\u2019s\u2122 Golden Mushroom Soup thinned with the drippings from the roast and use Gravy Master\u2122 or Kitchen Bouquet\u2122 to brown.\r\n",

Dust with flour and salt and pepper and braise on hot stove with a little olive oil before putting in the pot. Cook in crock pot for four to five hours on high, or eight hours on low.

In the past, every single time I add coke to a meat recipe (usually pork) it comes out sooo tender, which was the case here as well.  I used a pepsi, but I did pick up on the sweetness (I drink diet coke, so maybe that's why & I'm not a pepsi fan either) but my family RAVED about how good this was and didn't make mention of any sweetness so it was probably me.  For ease I stuck this all in the crock pot on high for 4 hours.  I also used cream of celery soup because that is all I had on hand & then added chopped mushrooms instead of the chopped celery.  Thanks Sher, will use again, my family kept saying how good it was ;o)",

Served to company tonight who said this was the \"best meal ever.\" Served with mashed potatoes, asparagus, spinach/orange/radish/green onion salad, and garlic bread. As recommended, I inserted garlic slivers into meat before browning lean chuck roast for extra flavor; and added sliced baby portabella mushrooms, extra carrot and celery. I decreased recipe amount to serve six and, rather than adjusting soup, cola, and mixes, I used full can of soup, full package of gravy mix and onion soup mix, and a small bottle of Classic Coke. Gravy was superb and meat was fork tender and not stringy. Company asked for recipe which I gladly provided. Will definitely make again for family and company.",

Cola is no more than sugar and coloring...add a few more items and you have BBQ sauce:) At any rate this roast came out tender and juicy. I cooked mine in my crockpot (mainly because I work during the week) and I was totally pleased with the results! If you are looking for a thick gravy you will need to make a slurry of cornstarch and water pouring it into the juice until you get the desired thickness. This was a tender and flavorful way to make a roast with ease. Thanks for sharing...this will become a part of my recipe box!",
