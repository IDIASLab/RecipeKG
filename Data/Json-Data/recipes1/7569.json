The soup is somewhat unusual, because the meat is cooked in the bowl. The beef is sliced very thin, almost thin enough to see through.  You might want to have the butcher slice it for you.  The boiling hot broth is poured over the noodles and raw meat.  The meat is quickly cooked in the hot broth in the time it takes to garnish the soup.",

Lemongrass is traditionally used by those of Cambodian and Thai origin which makes just as great a broth.

For added flavor my family fries a little minced garlic ahead of time until they are golden (takes only a few seconds!) and garnish the pho with them.",
