The tahini gives it a Middle Eastern feel and the lemon, garlic, and ginger flavors really give it a kick! Easy to make, just needs a blender or a food processor. Experiment by adding a bit more lemon or a bit less garlic, or adding ground mint. Works well on anything, especially on simple salads.",

The only changes I made was substituting apple cider vinegar for red wine vinegar, canola oil for olive oil - less about 1 tablespoon, adding a tablespoon of toasted sesame oil, and adding about 1 tablespoon of chopped chives.  Adding nutritional yeast will thicken it if you find it too thin, but I did not find that necessary.  I thought the consistency was perfect the way it is.  Very much like Goddess dressing.",
