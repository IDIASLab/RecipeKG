Also, I made things a lot easier on myself by NOT cooking the chicken before putting it in the crockpot.  I just put the whole boneless, skinless breast halves in the crockpot and covered it with the mixture.  Then I cooked on my \"auto\" setting for about 7 hours (that's 2 hours on high and the remaining time on low).  It wouldn't have had to cook that long though for the chicken to be done.  You could cook on high for 3-4 hours and it'll be done.  The chicken just falls apart.  Delicious.",

This is the dressing I remember from my childhood and what I've been trying to achieve all these years! The changes I made were minimal and reflect my personal tastes but I think it would have been just as good exactly as written. I didn't add chicken because we like ours separate and I didn't use the white bread. I added a cup of chopped celery and sauteed it with the onion and sage in 2 T. margarine. I added that to all the wet ingredients and seasonings then crumbled cornbread into the mixture until it was the consistency I wanted. Because the Crockpot is a very \"moist\" cooking environment it will only thicken a bit while cooking so make sure it's not too soupy at the beginning. Thank you Mindy for such a fantastic recipe. I can't wait to make this for my family at Thanksgiving and Christmas.",

I'm from the South where they take cornbread dressing seriously! I work, have a hubby, 3 teen boys & a toddler. I didn't have time to devote to making dressing for Christmas. I added chopped celery stalks, a box of herbed stuffing mix (my men have huge appetites) instead of day old bread, omitted the chicken since I was roasting turkey, set the time/temp on the slow cooker and forgot about it. The aroma had my family stalking the slow cooker. It was so flavorful. This is a staple going forward.",
