The topping is really to die for.  I liked the tartness of the cranberries, they will certainly make you pucker a little, if you like more sweet than tart add more sugar or a drizzle of maple syrup.  I brought this to a family gathering and everyone loved it, lots of people commented that it tasted like a rhubarb recipe.",

Based on others reviews, I used only 4 apples & 1/2 pkg (6oz) of cranberries, and it was plenty!  It filled one 9\" store bought deep-dish pie crust, and had enough filling leftover  to fill 6 tart shells.  I added chopped walnuts to the streusel topping which tasted great.  Before baking, I wrapped foil around the edge of the crust so it wouldn't burn during the baking which allowed the topping to get nice and brown & crisp.  Excellent.  I will be making another one for Christmas using the other half package of cranberries I have waiting for me in the freezer.  Thanks Blythe!",

This recipe was easy and very good, especially the streusel topping--my kids (ages 7 and 4)ate two pieces and wanted more!  But something was a little off for me--it was too sweet.  I sprinked a tiny bit of salt on my second piece, and it made all the difference.  It toned down the sweetness a little and made the taste richer.  Next time I make this, I will add 1/4-1/2 tsp. salt to the fruit mix.  Thanks for a great recipe, though.",
