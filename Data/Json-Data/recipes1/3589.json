I've   also made it with smoked ham hocks I've gotten from the butcher.  Of  course the home smoked ham makes the soup superlative, the butcher bone made it wonderful.  Either way, I think you'll enjoy it.  It can be made spicy if that's the way you prefer it.  It can also be topped with sour cream.",

However, I was preparing to e-mail this recipe to my daughter and was shocked to see it only had 2 reviews!  This soup was so much yummier than other Black Bean soups I tried out.  First of all, to those that feel it takes to long for the bean prepartion.....really, one can skip the overnight soak.  That mostly helps as far as keeping you quite so \"windy\" after eating.  The sherry is a most!  Do not skip it or any other sherry you may have on hand.  I slow cook mine for the better part of a day because we like our soup rather thick.  Oh, and one more thing!  I once tried dipping this soup over rice, ala`Red Beans & Rice.  Yeah!  Majorially yummy!  A side of corn bread muffins and it's all about heaven.  Thanks Patty's Mom!",

I have always enjoyed sherry as a finisher in soups and I wasn't disappointed this time around. The only thing keeping this recipe from a five-star rating is the investment of time it takes to prepare... soaking the beans overnight waiting for the beans to soften etc. Other than that it's a great recipe. Do note I had to at least double the amount of salt. And don't forget to remove the bay leaves before you blend the mixture.",

My whole family loved it. My kids' couldn't get enough of it and are already asking when we can have it again. I followed the directions as written. But at the end I made a few adjustments because it just tasted like it was missing a level of flavor somehow. I would suggest using some chicken stock or chicken flavor boost packs instead of just adding more and more water. I also added a little cumin Old Bay seasoning garlic powder onion powder and lots more black pepper. It really brought the flavor up to where I thought it should be. I didn't blend any of the soup like it stated. Instead I used the back of the spoon and kind of smashed the beans up against the side of the pot and that gave just enough mashed beans to give it that soup substance. My husband discovered that once it was cooled that it made for a great dip for tortilla chips as well! Can't wait to make this again definitely a keeper.",
