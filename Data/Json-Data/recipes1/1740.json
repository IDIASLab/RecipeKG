The filling and the parts of the cake adjacent to the filling are quite tasty and moist. However the top part of the cake is somewhat...dry (that's the best word I can think of to describe it). Not sure if the flour ratio is off in the recipe or if there is a better way to distribute the batter so that more of it is in contact with the filling. Speaking of the batter... I was very skeptical about the batter - it was unlike anything I've prepared before. Very stiff. Not like a cake batter but not like cookie dough either. But it baked up fine. Finally the glaze was flavorful too.",
