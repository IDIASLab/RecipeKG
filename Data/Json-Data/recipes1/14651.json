(This was my first attempt at that; I had a McCormick's Turkey Gravy packet ready and waiting for backup as gravy is not my forte). Thanks to this recipe it turned out I got to use the best of both worlds to make a great gravy!. I left out the giblets (nobody here is a fan of giblets) and lessened the water by 1/2 a cup for a nice thick absolutely delicious turkey gravy!. Thanks for the incredible easy-to-make and extremely tasty recipe.:) I'm definitely saving this one!",
