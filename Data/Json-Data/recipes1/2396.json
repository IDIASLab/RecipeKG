I really recommend using the paste that the recipe calls for so you get the deep color without using a ton of food coloring. After I halved each color I halved them again and pre-rolled the first 6 balls of each color so I could ensure I'd have enough of each color for each cookie. I at first tried to the first 12 but they started to dry out. Once I got my rope formed I started forming the inside coil. After three loops I took the tail end of the rope and wrapped it around the coil. I found a bag of 100 6\" sticks at Michaels and 100 baggies with ties that fit perfectly on the cookie. They also have a ton of different individual colored pastes to choose from. I will definitely be making these again!",

It's very time consuming but well worth the effort as they truly are pretty and kids love them. I found if I did most of the prep work to the dough like make all the balls for rolling before chilling the dough it makes it easier because the dough softens quickly which makes it difficult to coil so this way I did a bit at a time and kept the rest in the fridge. Very nice cookie. THX.",

The only thing I would warn you about is that they do take a while to make. You have to take a little dough of each color combine them with the other colors roll out and then coil up. So it does take some time but it is definately worth it! I had a lot of great comments about these.",
