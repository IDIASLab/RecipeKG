That being said the taste is dependant on the type of dressing you use, how long you marinate and what type of BBQ sauce you baste with...plus this recipe must have a typo. There's no way you need an 18 oz. bottle of BBQ sauce to baste 2 chicken breasts. I used a light Kraft Italian dressing that I spruced up a bit with some additional minced garlic, a little white wine, and fresh herbs. I marinated thawed chicken all day, then basted with KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce.  Overall, this is very tasty for only a couple of ingredients.",

The next day in the early afternoon I took them out of the bag and shook off the excess marinade. I then placed them in the slow cooker with the bbq sauce (used hot & spicy sauce) and cooked on low. Once done I shredded the chicken then served with store bought kaiser cheese and onion rolls chedder cheese slices lettuce and a bit of bbq sauce to make sandwiches. The chicken was so tender! But like everyone else this was more of a bbq chicken than a cajun chicken. Thanks for the recipe =o)",
