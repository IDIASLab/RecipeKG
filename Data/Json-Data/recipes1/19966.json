First it takes alot longer to caramelize the onions then it says,  I did it low and slow for about 45 min.  I used alot less mayo as I felt it overpowered a little (I used just 1/4 cup instead of half).  I also upped the amount of onions to just about 2 cups and added a few dashes of worchestershire sauce.  You really do have to let it sit overnight to really get the full effect but I'll never buy store dip again,  its a little time consuming but VERY easy and the taste is out of this world",
