So, I decided to add chopped almonds which made them quite delicious.  In the oven we used we found that 14 minutes was the perfect time setting. The dough was a little soft to make balls so just stick it in the freezer for a little and it makes it harder. If you don't like cakey cookies these are not for you.  Bon App!!",

Since I don't bake often (or at all really) I don't have much in the house save for the very basics - so my idea of making chocolate chip cookies was out cause I didn't have any chocolate chips in the house! BUT to get back on track here I did have the ingredients for this recipe and better yet I LOVE cimmamon. I'm rating this recipe for five stars because it completely trashed my cravings and was very yummy and easy to make. Only hint I'd give readers is to make sure that you bake them long enough.. I could have let the first batch of 12 sit in the over for at least another 5 minutes to make sure they were cooked all the way through.",

I also think they need more flavor; they would be really bland without the cinnamon-sugar mixture that you roll them in. These are ok for now but I probably won't make them again. (also I baked them at 325 for 10 minutes because I thought 300 sounded too low for a cookie.)",
