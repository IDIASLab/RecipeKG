It might have been better if I lined the tin. Also I was not sure if pie cherries were can cherries. In Australia there were no pie cherries unfortunately only canned ones with juice!. And I wasn't sure whether it had to be finely chopped or put whole. hahaha but the taste was absolutely delicious!!!",

I made this for my birthday & I brought it to work when we were celebrating. I substituted the wheat flour with gluten free flour (Bob's Red Mill All Purpose GF Flour) and a tsp of xanthan gum. I also added dairy free chocolate chips into the batter, and I drizzled some chocolate syrup on the top when it was done. And it was great! It got eaten before the \"regular\" cake did!\n\n(Addition 3 years later) I STILL get requests for this at work - even on other people's birthdays - and people ask me for the recipe all the time. ",

To reduce the fat I used 1/4 c each of apple sauce and oil instead of 1/2 c of oil. Result: fudgy and light with less fat and calories. I made a second batch without cocoa powder and used bananas and apple sauce instead. Result:BEST banana cake I ever ate. No frosting or sides necessary.",
