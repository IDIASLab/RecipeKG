                "reviewBody": "This recipe was perfect - let me tell you why. First, if following the recipe exactly, it sets perfectly. Make sure your cream cheese, butter and milk are blended well together. You may have to scrape the bowl a few times in order to get every morsel of each the butter and cream cheese blended. After you mix the coco and coconut together (once again scraping the bowl so everything is well mixed), it will seem like it's too thick. This is NORMAL. Do NOT add any more liquid ingredients to thin it out. When you add the sugar, the mix actually thins a bit. You'd think it was the opposite way around, but I assure you it is not. Not only does it thin to perfect spreading consistency, the added sugar gives it a beautiful glossy satin look. This recipe is amazing not only because it sets to well, but because of its flavor. Think of it - 1.5 cups of powdered sugar is unheard of in most quick frosting recipes. This frosting is creamy and sweet, but only lightly and not overpoweringly cloying like many other sugary frostings. Make it - you will love it.",

I tried fixing it even threw them in the freezer. Also the taste of cream cheese was very strong.
