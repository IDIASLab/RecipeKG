So this was a big deal. Everything had to be perfect. I came across this recipe and thought I'd try it out. IT WAS AWESOME!! It was very easy and didn't take a long time to prepare. The chestnuts really add a nice flavor texture to the stuffing. And it goes GREAT with gravy. We will be adding this to our repetoire of family recipes to be used on Thanksgivings and Christmas' in our homes from here on out. Thank you for sharing! Sincerely Paige Cassidy",

I'll be sure to pass this along to my Nana, she'll be thrilled. From what I gather this recipe may call for too much bread. I am going to try it this year with one loaf and see how it goes (it also depends on the size of your bird). I hope you try this with your family, they're sure to love it like my family does! Honestly I look more forward to this stuffing than the turkey!! Thanks again and happy Thanksgiving!",
