                "reviewBody": "This recipe was very tasty. I think it was more of a sauce than a glaze though. Which was fine with us. We had a thick cut center ham slice and I followed the directions on the ham package for the time and temp to bake the ham. The last 15 minutes of baking time I added the \"glaze\" to the top of the ham baked for the remaining time and the \"glaze\" hadn't \"glazed\". I then upped the temp and baked 15 minutes longer. It still was saucy on top. I halved the recipe and there was still at least a cup of sauce/glaze left. We just dipped our ham in it as a side sauce. The flavor was really good just not what I expected. This sauce would be really good for dipping Chinese eggrolls in. Thanks! Erin",
