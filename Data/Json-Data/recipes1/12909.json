It has the perfect amount of filling to crab ratio which for me is you barely taste filling and all crab. I made a few adjustments; used Ritz Crackers sauteed a very small amount of onions/celery/garlic added a little cayenne and crushed red pepper. I mixed everything e except the crab meat and put that in last and just turned with a spatula so I didn't break the lumps. After forming the crab cakes I topped each with a little extra old bay seasoning. For crab I used Blue Star pasteurized lump crab meat in the packet it was very good. I have no opinion on the sauce as I like a sweeter sauce so I went with the Honey Mustard II another poster suggested with some adjustments it was excellent as well.",

I added a few extra spices for a bit of extra kick including 2x the Old Bay seasoning, and a dash of powdered garlic, crushed red peppers and pepper.  I also added fresh diced sweet onion and red pepper to \"hearten\" the cakes for a main dish.  Rather than sauting, I opted to broil until the cakes were golden brown on both sides.  The cakes held together fine and tasted perfectly; they even had a bit of a crunch.  The sauce was a perfect compliment to the cakes - although be forewarned, the sauce doesnt taste very well on its own.  \r\n\r\nI highly recommend this recipe.",

In fact had I not tasted the Ginger Crabcakes another recipe on this site that \"takes the cake\" (it is AWESOME) I would have given these a 5. The sauce was not so much a hit tho it did add a little \"something\" to tantilize the taste buds...just not worth the trouble or calories. The best thing about the recipe was that it did in fact have only little filler so what you get is crab crab and more crab. Refrigerating it as suggested is imperitive; otherwise they will crumble.

The crab cake was lacking egg and cracker crumbs and ended up just falling apart. I used to make crab cakes fresh after catching/cleaning with my parents back home in WA but now in TN I tried using pre-cleaned store bought. I don't know if it's a difference in the fresh v. frozen texture or truly the lack of egg cracker. All I know is that right now I'm making the worst crab stir fry ever. This did NOT take on the cake form for me at all.",
