I diced my onions and cooked them with the mushrooms, cooking until all of the moisture was gone. I baked the meat with the sauce and mushrooms and onions tightly covered for 1-1/2 hours without the stuffing. I wanted to make sure the meat was very tender. I then added 1/2 cup more water and then topped it with the stuffing, covered and baked for another hour. This made for very tender beef, a nice amount of sauce with the stuffing it was awesome. Next time I would also add 1 cup of frozen petite green peas when I add the 1/2 cup extra water to the meat and then top with the stuffing.",
