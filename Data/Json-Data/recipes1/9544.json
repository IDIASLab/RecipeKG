In the process I've reduced the oil to 1/2 cup, and this last one was skimpy on the sour cream too (because I didn't have the full amount on hand).. I really think it's better with the less oil.

Then I tried it for myself and it flopped! I baked it about 20 minutes longer than it said because it wouldn't get done then the top got too dark- but when I tried to invert it onto a rack the top half stayed in the pan (but it still tasted really good so I put it in a ziploc and my fiance and I ate it with ice cream and hot fudge!!).....so then I tried it in 3 8 inch layer pans-- that worked pretty good but lost the \"pound cake\" feel. FINALLY I tried it again today with only 1/2 cup of the oil and I used 1 cup of choc chips-- and it turned out beautifully-- I'm taking it to work tomorrow for a co worker who is a chocaholic and I know he'll love it!! Just a note though I had to bake it for an hour and 20 minutes. My oven may be a little off but I have a temp guage that said it was fine-- My point is-- if it doesn't work the first time try try again because this cake is one that you won't be able to resist!!!!! yummy....",

It was wonderful!  I did use about 1/2 cup oil and reduced the sugar to about 1/3 cup.  Note that this is a very moist cake.  I baked it for about 65 minutes because I didn't think it was getting done.  It always seemed wet inside.  I probably baked it a little too long - the inside was still very moist but the outside browned a bit too much.  A very versatile and easy recipe.  Thanks!\r\n3/31/03 - I made this recipe for my Mom over the weekend.  I used a white cake mix, lemon pudding and about 3/4 cup of dried blueberries.  It was very good.
