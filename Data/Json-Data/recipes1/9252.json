I always double the recipe and have sliced and lightly fried (in olive oil) meatloaf the third day. My family actually prefers it this way and it is a great time-saving suggestion.",

I don't recommend doing this because the loaf spreads and doesn't retain the loaf form very well. I will use the loaf pan (as recommended) the next time I make this.  It will be the first dish I think of when I have left over white rice on hand as it is perfect for using leftover rice with.  Also, this would be a good recipe for people who like to stuff green peppers.  We enjoyed the sweet taste this meatloaf offered it was not overwhelming.  But like other reviewers have noted it needs salt and pepper for sure!  Very easy to prepare especially if rice is already made.",

I did change it up a bit though after reading through everyone elses reviews...first off I changed the servings to 6. I used almost 2lbs of ground chuck. I added one egg and 1/4 cup bread crumbs to help it stay formed. I used about 2 Tblsp Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce for mixing and only used ketchup to top the loaf with at the end. I only used 2 tsps of brown sugar and I added garlic salt and regular salt as well as coarse ground pepper and minced garlic. I used about one cup of cooked rice instead of a little more like it called for. I definately reccomend this recipe it is very easy and quite tasty!! We really liked it and will be making it again sometime soon I'm sure!",
