It was easy to make and delicious. I did end up having to add more olive oil to prepare the chicken and a bit more marsala wine for the sauce but overall it was great! I would reccommend letting the sauce and the chicken sit for a while so that the flavors are absorbed.",

Instead of using egg and just flour I omited the egg and added 1/2 tsp garlic powder 1/4 tsp black pepper 1/2 tsp dried oregano to 1/4 cup flour and dipped the chicken in that and then fried it. I didn't have the meat extract and couldn't find it at 2 grocery stores so I ommitted it and added 1 tsp chicken bullion granules. I used cooking wine so didn't add any additional salt. Before swirling the butter and juice I added about 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream and thickened it with a water/flour mixture. I served it to guests and they loved it.",

                "reviewBody": "An excellent authentic Marsala. To add complexity to the flavor and easily bring this up to restaurant quality consider the following modifications MERWIN MARSALA 1.1: 1) Only use 3/4 pound chicken with the ingredients specified reducing the serving size to three or so. 2) Substitute 1 tsp. \"Gravy Master\" for \"meat extract\" - I can only assume that's what Merwin meant. At any rate it works wonderfully and adds a rich color and flavor to the sauce. 3) Substitute 2 tbsp. each of both butter and margarine instead of 4 tbsp. butter since margarine burns less easily. 4) Start with 1/2 tsp. black pepper no extra salt and the oregano reduced to 1 tsp. and work from there. Also consider adding 1/2 tsp. sweet Hungarian paprika to the other dry spices. 5) Add one large clove of finely chopped garlic and one large shallot to the butter in step (1) first allowing them to cook a little before adding the chicken. Sprinkle approximately 1/2 the dry spice on the chicken before cooking and save the rest to add to the sauce later as originally specified. 6) Although I originally used 1/2 cup of Marsala wine as specified I will probably increase this to 3/4 cup next time. Use some corn starch to thicken the sauce at the end of step (3) if you like your sauce thicker - I used 1 tsp. mixed with 1 oz. cold water. Let the chicken sit in the sauce for a few minutes on low heat at the end. 7) Optional: \"Baby Bella\" mushrooms instead of white mushrooms.",

I skipped the breading process and seasoned the chicken prior to cooking as I found it to be slightly bland the first time I made it. To season I used garlic powder onion powder and pepper. I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch as it is very yummy over brown rice and angel hair pasta. This is a new family favorite!!!! Thanks Merwin for awakening our tastebuds!",
