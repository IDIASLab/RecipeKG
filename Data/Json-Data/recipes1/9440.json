When my dough was done and I went to make the balls, it totally collapsed into a gooey pile, but I still dipped the wads in the butter, and then in my herbs and parm, and after I let it rise it looked like real dough again.  In the end it was perfect!!  Tasted great, my whole family loved it.  Just don't worry if it looks like it flopped, it will come out OK in the end.  WONDERFUL!!  Thank you, Susanne!",

                "reviewBody": "I just baked this tonight for the first time (and pretty much only my 2nd time to ever make bread) and it was brilliant. I always tweak recipes, and I dont have a breadmaker, so I started off with warming the water, mixing in the sugar and sprinking the yeast over to foam/cream for a while, before mixing in the rest of the ingredients to make the dough, kneading and allowing to rise for 30min. Then following with breaking off hunks and dipping in the butter, mixed herbs minced garlic etc, and putting in the pan, and again allowing to rise before baking. I also probably had closer to 2 cups of flour as the dough was a bit sticky, and it was still sticky ish but probably easier to handle after that. Oh and I don't really measure my seasonings so they were probably 2x the recipe. The result was beautiful soft bread with a nice hint of garlic and subtle herb flavours, and cheese and tomato that i sprinkled on top. It had a lovely thin crust, and broke apart easily.   Thank you for this wonderful idea! I plan to use the base of the recipe for sweet bread and different savoury flavour combos, as well as a basic white loaf.  Hope for people who dont have breadmakers! :)",

I used crushed garlic right in the melted butter. The first time I made this I mixed the herbs with the butter and ended up needing more the butter soaked into the herbs. The second time I rolled them in butter then in the herb mixture and they were quite messy and I got a bit too much herb on the balls cause they were so wet. Next time I will mix the herbs with the butter and make a bit extra it seemed to go on more evenly. I used freshly grated parmesan cheese and sprinkled it over each layer both times and it was really nice. I used shredded cheddar the second time(sprinkled between layers) mmmmm it was really good. I didn't have the herbs called for so I just made a mixture of oregano basil parsley and dehydrated onion. This bread was so much fun to pull apart and eat. We had it with baked spagetti and also with beef stew. I bet it would be good to do this with butter brown sugar and cinnamon maybe a Christmas morning treat.",

I kneaded it with a little more flour to make it a bit easier to handle. I used my own Italian herbs minced garlic and Parmesan cheese for the topping I added this to the melted butter which meant I only had to dip the dough once. Next time I think I am going to try using olive oil rather than butter which I think is more traditional with the toppings I used. The bread was very easy to make looked great and tasted amazing!",
