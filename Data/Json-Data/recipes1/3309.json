I poured that into the machine; combined all dry ingredients & poured that on top of the wet ingrediemts. Set on medium & voila! a beautiful loaf of bread!!",

The first time you use it in the bread machine don't use the delayed timer. Instead watch the dough to see if it needs more or less milk. Should form a smooth soft ball after kneading. Test the crust setting it gets dark fast. Record this amount of milk and crust time for the next time. This prevents a dried out or blackened loaf. I found I needed a bit more milk and a medium crust on sweet dough cycle.",

I now live in a rural Nova Scotia town, and Challah bread isn't something one would usually come accross. Anyway, now I can make this in my bread machine, and I am delighted with the results!!  I too did as another reviewer and set my machine to the dough cycle, so I could take the dough out, braid it, and bake it in a conventional oven.  Once braided, brush the bread with a beaten egg,and sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds. This is beautiful, great tasting Challah. Thanks Suzy for a wonderful recipe.",
