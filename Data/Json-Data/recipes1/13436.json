Do not peel them, (that's where all the nutrition and color are), but just slice.  Use 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup, and stir-fry the veggies in the butter rather than boil them, (again, to retain flavor, color, and nutrition).  Four eggs instead of three.  Rather than the cracker topping, I used my own whole wheat bread crumbs, with a bit of Italian seasoning added to them.  Delicious!  Oh yes...only bake 35 minutes.  Left-overs are fabulous.  I think this would also work well if you wanted to make double and freeze one to bake at a future time.",

We used 4 medium to large ones and instead of slicing, I diced to about 1/2 thick. I used 4 eggs instead of 3, added 2 tablespoons of milk to the beaten eggs, and used a half of a cup more cheese. I crushed the crackers and used a little bit less than 1/4 cup of melted butter to give them a good crumbly texture. Added some Mrs. Dash to the mixture and baked as per the recipe. Served with a wedge of iceberg lettuce with light ranch dressing drizzled on top (and tomatoes if desired). Was a hit with my family! Even my picky daughter!!",

I used boxed chicken flavored stuffing mix (the kind with the flavoring already in the bread crumbs) and used about 3/4 stick of butter to drizzle over the stuffing mix.  I added garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I used 3 cups of zucchini and added black pepper (to taste)  It's very yummy and my 7 year old even cleaned his plate.  Nice variation to the ordinary.",

I used 2 eggs and added about 3 tablespoons of cream but only about 1 tablespoon of butter. I only had saltines so I crushed those up and added shredded Parmesan to them- made a delicious crispy cheesy topping! Will definitely make again- thanks!",
