And then they almost make it sound like a personal mission that people took to rob them of their time if a recipe isn't to their liking.  Perhaps a review should consider that GOOD food takes the love of cooking, and anything less WILL be evident \"somewhere\".  And often times in classic french recipes such as this one, it DOES take time and if you \"read and think\" before you begin you can figure that out. My personal opinion on this recipe is that it is VERY classic and delicious.  It was meant to be meaty and rich and not too spiced up...warm and comforting and classic...and it is!  I serve mine over \"smashed\"  garlic potatoes with the skins left on and a fruit parfait for dessert.",

I also used a Pinot Noir (don't use supermarket wines.  They're not glass worthy for a reason!).  I froze all this food in meal-sized portions.  When it was thawed and reheated, it was even more delicious! I'm ready for any holiday company that might call for an elegant meal. Served with creamy mashed potatoes, asparagus tips and french bread. Wow!  Worth the effort.  Thanks Judy. -- Update 11/2004 -- this is still the best recipe I've ever found here at allrecipes.com.  Follow the tips - no shortcuts, and make a lot at once to freeze.  Company coming?  Thaw, reheat, make sides, and take the bows.",

After I add the mushrooms and its just about finished I spoon single servings into a medium size ramekin (one per person ) and place flakey puff pastry over top and bake it for an additional 10-15 or until the pastry is golden.  This is by far the best way to eat it, with a side of green salad. YUMMY!  I have made this dish 5 times now.  My boyfriend loves it and guests are always impressed.  I always make about 10 servings and freeze the rest, then its a quick elegant dinner all you have to do is defrost it scoop it into a ramekin thaw more puff pastry shove it in the oven and serve it up.

I had to make a bit of extra \"gravy\" (marinade) when I re-heated it after sitting for a couple of days in the fridge, but that was easy and it turned out marvelous. Some mentioned that you should use a \"good\" burgundy or Pino Grigio; I myself used the burgundy cooking wine I found at the grocery store. I substituted some sherry wine designed for cooking for the cognac, (both MUCH cheaper than the liquor store!) and I found the recipe one of the best I've had. Summary: marinade for 3 days, and rely on your local grocery store to provide the cooking wine(s) for you!! It is absolutely superb over homemade garlic mashed potatoes! I would serve it to God. ",

Sadly, this rule of thumb did not apply here.\n\nI made this Christmas Day for 25 people (4x original recipe) and it about did us in.  The marinating was quite easy, but the prep on the day it was being served was deceptively involved -- adding to the stress of the day.  The fragrance while cooking was lovely.....but at the moment we had all been waiting for, when the meal was presented, the taste turned out to be only \"average.\"  Nothing special, not even memorable, just okay.  I could have spent far less time cooking and far more time enjoying my guests with a less involved recipe, and had the taste of the meal come out the same.\n\nLike me, a lot of reviewers who made this recipe spent many hours and dirtied a houseful of dishes making it.  I can only think that the reviews are so positive because once the investment of time and effort was made, they just couldn't bring themselves to giving it a review of \"not memorable.\"  The high ratings are probably more of an A for Effort than an A for Taste.",

I followed the recipe exactly and it was mediocre at best.I've been cooking for many years and I've prepared dozens of recipes from this site. I don't think the poor results this time were due to something I did wrong. This is the first review I've given. I wanted to warn others that if you want to try this recipe try it yourself before you serve it to guests. The results are a common beef stew and not an elegant dinner party dish.",
