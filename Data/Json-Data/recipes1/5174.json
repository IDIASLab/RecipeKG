I used egg whites, instead of butter, (you know, those pesky fat and calorie things)used crackers and ranch style croutons (like someone else suggested) and cooked them 10-15 minutes at 425 on the top rack.  I also tenderized the chicken breasts before i cut them up.  I did not have a soggy piece of chicken, on either side, these were super crunchy.  My WHOLE family said these were the absolute best, and when the WHOLE family agrees, you can bet it was good!",
