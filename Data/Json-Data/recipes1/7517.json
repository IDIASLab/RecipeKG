You can easily replace the eggs with an egg substitute with no noticeable taste difference.  My family does not, but you can easily add cooked bulk sausage to this stuffing. For a moist stuffing made outside of the bird, add additional chicken stock and cover with foil while baking. Remove foil for the last 20 minutes to crisp up the top.",

It makes a HUGE amount probably enough to feed 15 people. We only had 8 and it was still towering afterwards. I did omit the mushrooms and used fresh sage. I wasn't sure how long to cook it since we did it outside the bird but I went for about 40 minutes the first 20 with foil and the second 20 without. This worked well and the top was crispy but not burnt. Yum yum yum!!",
