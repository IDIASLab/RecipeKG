I used 2 cups of rhubarb and 3 cups of tart granny smith apples plus 3 cups of unsweetened frozen mixed berries. Next time I would reduce the sugar by at least 1/2 a cup. Also and I don't know why but after 35 minutes the top was very brown even black in some places and the apples and rhubarb were still a bit crunchy. I scooped the black parts off and it all got gobbled up anyway. Maybe the top got too brown because I substituted margerine? Don't know. Will make this again.",
