I strongly suggest to choose a very small RED onion though. (It ended up being 1 and 1/2 cups total chopped, or 3/4 cup per wheel) Also I also suggest you use portabella mushrooms as I did, and perhaps because of these tweaks I made I ended up needing one more tablespoon of butter. I caramelized the onions first, then added the mushrooms and dates and cooked them for an additional 3 minutes which is when I needed the extra tablespoon of butter. The quantity of filling was so huge (again, most likely from my tweaking the ingredients) that it was larger than the entire wheel of brie, so I decided to split 2 wheels of brie instead of just one in half (using a copper wire to cut them- so easy that way!) and it was the perfect amount for the two 8 ounce wheels of brie. I also chose to cook them in the oven rather than nuke them. 350 for 20 minutes. Thank you and I will use this again- especially for wine tasting parties or as a treat for the holidays.",

The combination of sweet dates and savory onions/mushrooms is amazing! I agree with other reviewers that it often makes more than enough filling but that just means I get to sample it while I'm putting it together.;-) I have to respond to someone's suggestion to \"cut the rind off the Brie before serving\". Um the rind is edible and a big part of Brie's appeal. Cutting it off not only is unnecessary and would make the wheel look very messy but it also would reveal the cook's complete lack of knowledge about the dish. If you don't want a rind use mozzarella--lol!",
