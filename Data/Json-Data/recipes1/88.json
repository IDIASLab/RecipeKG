The recipe appeared back in 1970 in an issue of Family Circle. The cinnamon-sugar is really what makes the cookie here. As other reviewers have said this cookie is soft and \"cake-like\" but that's why they're called SOFT sugar cookies. The dough is very sticky but we always just kept in the refrigerator and then formed it into balls and placed them on the cookie sheet... worked like a charm! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe. It brought back so many happy memories of baking with my mom.",
