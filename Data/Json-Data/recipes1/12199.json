I don't understand why some users are calling it \"bland.\" I like that it's rather mild (but still really tasty!). It doesn't overpower the taste of the salmon. I used dried dill, and squeezed the lemon juice over the fish, rather than topping it with slices, but only because I don't like an overly-lemony flavor and didn't want it to turn out too strong. Good recipe, and very easy!",

When my husband saw the salmon sitting on the stove waiting to go into the oven he took the liberty of sprinkling lots of Montreal Seasoning (i think it was the spicy kind) all over the salmon fillet. It turned out delicious and of course I used about 15 garlic cloves that I mashed up with my motar and pestle and spread all over the fillet. I set my oven to low broil instead of 450 degress and it cooked for about 15 to 20 minutes. I cooked my fish on foil but I did not cover it. My husband then poured a little sake around the outside of the fish when I took it out of the oven. Needless to say the few changes we made turned out to be successful and we'll certainly rely on this recipe again in the future. Thanks for sharing.",
