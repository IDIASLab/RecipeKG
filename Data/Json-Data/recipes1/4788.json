I followed the recipe except I didn't have chicken breasts so I used chicken quarters. I partially boiled them first and increased the cooking time. I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients and I needed to thin out my pantry a little. I used tortilla chips instead of corn tortillas. And I totally forgot about adding the cheese! I'm sure I would have liked it better with the cheese. I agree with others that say the sauce would make a good chili con queso dip. But I would only use chili without beans. I didn't like them in the dish. The chicken turned out good and moist but while eating it I had to add salt to mine for flavor. I think I will try it with hamburger meat and also as a queso dip but without the cream of chicken soup. Overall it was a pretty good recipe different and very easy.",
