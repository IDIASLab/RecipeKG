It was when I started slicing them that my problems began. I only got 18 out of the dough so I thought I must have sliced them too thick I suppose they were about 1/4 inch thick. However when I pulled them out of the oven after 8 minutes I found that if anything I should have cut them thicker. They had spread quite a bit and were very thin. They also weren't done so I put them back in the oven for a further 2 minutes. Because they were thin I had some trouble getting them off the cookie sheet I lost about half the batch that way. It's a shame I can't rate these higher because my daughters said that those I managed to salvage did taste really good. Maybe it was something I did and someone else will have more luck. Thanks for letting me try.",

Instead of adding the lemon zest to my batter I whizzed it with the flour in my food processor let it sit for 15 minutes then sifted out the zest bits. Then I sectioned half a lemon and separated out the palps and mixed it into the dough after I mixed in the flour. It gave the intense bursts of lemon I like in my cookies without having to add extra sugar to balance it.",
