It still was too much anise and overpowers the taste of the wheat. Don't try this recipe it's a waste of flour!",

Here are the changes that I've made: - I halve the recipe(which doesn't really matter) I left out the anise AND I started off with proofing the yeast using the first 1/4cup water(lukewarm) together with 1/4teaspoon of the 1/4cup sugar for 5-10 minutes. Then added this yeast mixture into the remaining 1cup water. STIRRED WELL. Then added the flour mixture (flour b.s b.p sugar AND a pinch of salt) into the yeast mixture a little at a time stirring until just the right consistency for kneading (till the dough doesn't stick to your fingers). Kneaded for 15 minutes (using hand) and let it rise for 1st time about an hour (or doubled in size) and lightly punched down reshaped a little and rise 2nd time for 45-60 min (or doubled in size). It only took 30minutes to bake in a 400F oven. By the way I think the baking soda gives it a slight odd flavor.",
