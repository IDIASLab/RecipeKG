I omitted the salt, and added garlic powder and the paprika to my already seasoned bread crumbs. The kids loved them and I will definitely be making these again with my alterations.",

I think if you try to flip the chicken too soon that might cause the breading to fall off or stick to the pan. But if you use foil and spray and wait about 10 minutes before turning I think the breading stays on better that way.",

I love chicken fingers when I go out to eat. Now I think these are better than the deep-fried versions in restaurants. My tip would be to put only 3 strips at a time in the bag when coating. Add more garlic powder if you enjoy the flavor of garlic. Onion powder would probably be great too in addition to the garlic powder.",
