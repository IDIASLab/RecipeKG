It's so easy once you find the trick...WHICH IS keep mixing but don't start timing your 7 minutes until after the water returns to boiling and run your mixer on high for the full 7 minutes. It's thick and creamy and tastes like marshmallow fluff. Perfect on chocolate cake or cup cakes. However you have to spread it on a completly cool cake while the frosting is still slightly warm, and DO NOT cover it it will stick to everything (as does fluff) and it does get a little grainy after it sets for a long period (6-8 hours) of time to best to make just a few hours before serving. Sounds like a lot of work but it's really not. AND IT'S WORTH WHAT LITTLE TIME IT DOES TAKE! YUMMY!!!!",

I've noticed several of the reviews stated that theirs fell flat in spite of following the recipe exactly - perhaps I can give some insight? I've learned the hard way over many years that you cannot make this frosting on a rainy day, or even a very overcast day - the humidity in the air will prevent the egg whites from whipping up, no matter what you do. So, my advice is to check with Jim Cantore the day before you want to do this frosting. :) Otherwise, it is awesome! Perfect for a coconut cake!!!",

Here is what I did: I had my cake cooled, the water boiling in the bottom of the double boiler, and mixer ready. Then, in the top of the bouble boiler (not over heat yet) I measured out the sugar and cream of tartar/light corn syrup, whichever you prefer.Then I separated the eggs in a small bowl. Placed the flavoring measured out, in a small measuring cup. Added the water and eggs to the sugar and set over boiling water. Immediately began mixing on high and within just one minute it was already getting that whiter look to it. \n\nAfter 7 minutes I removed from heat, added flavor and beat another minute. \n\nImmediately cover cake as once it cools for about 5 minutes it will rip up your cake- it gets a little thicker.\n\nHopefully this helps the people who were having trouble with the recipe. My new go to for 7-minute.",

This was an easy, good frosting--which is not too sweet.  The only thing I'd do differently is start with 1/2 tsp of vanilla first, as with a full teaspoon it tasted a bit to alcohol-y from the extract.  This is not as sweet as other 7-minute frostings, which was a good pairing with my super sweet, rich strawberry cake.  I'll definitely make this again.  It's great as it doesn't require confectioner's sugar, which I usually don't have on hand.",
