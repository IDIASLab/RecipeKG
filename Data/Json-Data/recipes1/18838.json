                "reviewBody": "Hi, everyone:) love this recipe! Made many changes for diet restrictions salt/fat. First,no aluminum foil,set directly on olive oil sprayed pan. This omitted having to turn them, they browned on both perfectly. I used olive oil spray on pan and sandwich tops before oven. I found King Arthur gluten free all purpose flour,used that and instead of salt/pepper in flour I used garlic pepper. Gives it a great flavor. I added Red Hot into the egg dip. I used 4C seasoned unsalted bread crumbs a staple here with no salt and just the best flavor.The cheese was a challenge, used deli swiss at first cut in half but found it was too much cheese and they leaked. So next batch I switched to the party pre-cuts, smaller perfect amount with no leakage. I also tried the shredded cheese which i thought wouldn't stay in upon dipping but it actually worked fine. Instead of salami slices I used Margherita low sodium pepperoni bag using 4 slices to a sandwich and it was just enough. Last, I keep a mixture of 1/2 grated parmesan cheese and 1/2 4C seasoned unsalted breadcrumbs with garlic pepper in a container in the refrigerator at all times because we use it for everything.It's usually 2c./2c./1 tablespoon. until you figure out how much garlic pepper works for your family. Because of using mixture no parmesan topping needed.Used aluminum foil to cover once browned about 30 minutes. Used 2 pieces of eggplant per sandwich. The olive oil spray and other changes really cut back on /salt/fat:)Enjoy!",

I subbed fontina for the provolone because that was what I had on hand and served with warm marinara - because my husband has to have sauce!  I did peel the eggplant and salt it to eliminate the bitterness (just a personal preference.). These were very simple to make. Much less work than frying the eggplant - and healthier too! The only thing that I found odd was that it called for 16 slices of eggplant to make 4 sandwiches. Not sure what I should do with the extra slices of eggplant :-)",
