It's healthy (at least relative to other pies!) because of the carrots as well. One tip I have you don't need a food processor to puree the carrots (I don't own one). I put the carrots in my steamer for a little bit. Then put the carrots in the bowl that I was going to use anyway and smushed them by using my hand held blender. Worked out great! Highly recommend this recipe!",
