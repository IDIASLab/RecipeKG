Also, I have made it both with and without the cornflakes on top, and my family likes it better without. Leaving out the flakes will eliminate even more of the unwanted butter. Another thing I like to do with this recipe is to grease the casserole dish, put the tater tots on the bottom and top it with the rest of the ingredients, reserving some of the cheddar chz for the very top.",

I didn't have cornflakes so I used regular saltine crackers and poured the melted butter over them.  Also, I used frozen tator tots (for lack of time to thaw them), and I cooked it for about 1 hr. 15 minutes.  I covered it with foil for the entire time except about 15-20 minutes.  When I uncovered, I watched until the cracker were nicely browned them removed it from the oven.  The sour cream makes it very rich, so you could probably adjust the amount to your liking.  This would be very good if you added chopped ham, or for breakfast added crumbled sausage.  Yummy!",

Used cream of mushroom soup since I had it on hand and left off the parmesan cheese.  Didn't thaw the tots and still cooked thru.  A little experimenting, this could easily be a favorite.
