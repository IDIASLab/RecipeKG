Here's how I pulled off a fantastic white wine sauce using this recipe (my first white wine sauce and huge hit with my hubby):  When the butter was melted, I added one XL clove of garlic, minced, and as soon as the first bit started to turn golden, I added 12oz, of fresh mushrooms, quartered (instead of the jarred/canned kind).  I skipped the salt altogether, as well as the flour.  I made 3/4 cup of broth with 1/2 a veggie bullion cube (this was weak broth, according to the bullion cube's directions) and combined that with a whole cup of white wine (double what the recipe calls for - and I added even more later).  I added the broth/wine mix to the butter/shrooms/garlic mix and kept heating it until it almost simmered.  Then came 1/2 can of evaporated milk (instead of the heavy cream, which is expensive).  I added a boatload of basil, parsley, and cracked black pepper, too, and two shakes of onion powder (instead of \"Italian seasoning\").  Then I took OUT about 1/2 cup of the liquid and set it aside in a small bowl.  Into that bowl I added almost 2tbsp. of cornstarch, and \nI mixed it in until there were no lumps.  Then of course the contents of that bowl went back into the sauce, and at this point I added a little sea salt to taste (certainly not a whole teaspoon!), more pepper, and a whole other cup of wine (what's the point of wine sauce if you can't taste the wine because you've cooked it all out?!).  I omitted the egg altogether (because many reviewers ",

I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and a small can of black olives for my daughter that loves olives. My daughter that doesn't like mushrooms or olives picked hers out (she does that with everything) but she really liked the flavor of the sauce. I served it mixed in with fusilli pasta and garnished with fresh chopped seeded tomato and fresh chopped basil for eye appeal. One thing I didn't like was the egg mixed in it didn't taste bad or anything I just didn't like the way the egg white looked in the sauce but you couldn't see it once the sauce was mixed with the pasta. Next time I plan to omit the egg and add a little extra flour instead. I also think this sauce would be excellent with capers instead of or in addition to the mushrooms. There were no left overs thanks for the recipe.",
