First of all these little buggers are a pain to make but I like a good challenge and ended up coming up with a system that worked.  But BE CAREFUL the instructions say to cook the pot stickers in oil and then add water.    I knew water and oil didn't mix so I tried to add the water carefully to the side of the pan and hot grease went flying everywhere.  I even got burnt on my cheek.  I then came up with a two skillet solution (frying the pot stickers in one pan and then moving them to a 2nd pan for steaming).  Also I highly recommend keeping a couple eggs mixed with a bit of water in a bowl near your prep area because you will have to use it to get the wrappers to stick.  I coated each of the four sides of the wrapper as it was laying out flat before putting the mixture in.  Then after the wrapper was closed I wet my fingers again with egg wash and coated the outside seam.  I would have given this recipe 4 stars for the end result because I think they turned out well but the danger of mixing oil with water really needs to be addressed in the main writing of this recipe.  Recommend this review so it gets near the top if you think this is as serious issue as I do.",

                "reviewBody": "Fantastic recipe! A lot like the pot stickers my mom and I make together. You can put pretty much anything into these (tofu, bean sprouts, onion, different kinds of meat, etc) but it is very important that you squeeze as much liquid out of the filling (if you use tofu or a lot of vegetables) as you can before you stuff your wrappers or they will tear as you cook them. And as you seal the wrappers try to squeeze out as much air as you can or they can tear as they cook. The amount of water to steam them is completely dependant on the thickness of your wrappers. I got some from Walmart that were delicious, but a little thin so they didn't need too much water (3/4 c?) My mom's from the asian market were much thicker and needed a lot of water (about a cup, maybe more). Cooking the pork beforehand is completely unnecessary. You can also cook them by just frying them on both sides or boiling them in soup. They freeze very well, but will need an extra minute or two for cooking time.",

I covered a deep frying pan with PAM--and sprayed some on the dumplings themselves--then browned bottoms for about 4 min. Then I slowly added 1/2 water to pan, covered, and steamed for 10 min. Then I uncovered the pan and let them cook until all the water was gone. (Made this in three batches.)If you're afraid the pork is not completely cooked, you may steam/cook longer, but usually that's plenty of time. Another excellent sauce is to simply combine balsamic vinegar and a small amount of chili oil (avail. at Asian market)in a bowl for dunking.",

I made modifications to the recipe not because I felt they needed it but because I was trying to make these a little more healthy. I did omit the cabbage (I haven't seen ones with cabbage in them) and I used ground chicken instead of pork. I used ground ginger. I also added minced carrots and onions. I left the ground chicken raw and mixed the ingredients then cooked them in peanut oil instead of sesame oil and then steamed them in chicken broth. While steaming I placed a top on top of the skillet. I also steamed for additional 7 minutes - wanted to make sure the ground chicken was thoroughly cooked. I also used Leanne's sauce of 2 TBSP soy sauce 2 TBSP rice wine vinegar 1 tsp sesame oil and 1 tsp minced scallion which was right on point. Loved this recipe and will definitely make again!!!!",

For those that state that this isn't right, believe me it is...I am Chinese and was raised in a chinese home.  This is the traditional way on how to cook them.  As well, to keep the dough together and be able to do the fan folding seam, DO NOT USE EGG!  Use water, egg gives them a unappealing taste!",

                "reviewBody": "These were wonderful--a lot of work though but worth it. I combined two recipes together. I only used 1/2 c. chopped cabbage using the blender method to chop. It was easy this way just make sure you squeeze the water out before adding it to the mixture. I also didn't precook my pork just mixed and let it sit while I made the dough. If you want to make your own dough use 2 c. flour and 3/4 c. 2 Tbsp. water--allow to rest for 30 min. Then roll out to 1/8\" thick and cut with 3\" circle cutter. Make sure these are really cooked before serving since the pork wasn't precooked. Mine took about 15 min. total. First I browned them in a little oil for 5 min. then poured 1/3 c. water and covered tightly simmering 10 min. or until liquid is gone. Enjoy!",
