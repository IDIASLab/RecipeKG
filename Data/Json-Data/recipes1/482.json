                "reviewBody": "For those of you having trouble with the dough remember that this is a sugar cookie dough. Don't try to work it like a pastry dough or a brownie. I use this variation and it never fails. Use a 10x15 jelly roll pan. Drop small spoonfuls of dough evenly across the pan until only small open spaces are left between the spoonfuls. Press everything together gently but firmly and bake for about 12 minutes. I use 2 cups of chocolate chips (which does take longer to 'set'). For a greater taste contrast use dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet. It is easier to 'pre-cut' the bars when the chocolate is almost but not quite hardened. Use the blade of a pastry cutter and press down or use a heavy-duty pizza wheel. My bars always keep a nice 'chewy 'cookie' texture for a long time - even when I shipped them to a campus and they sat in the mailroom for 3 days before being picked up. I think that must be because they are only about as thick as a cookie. As far as I'm concerned the worst part is peeling the plastic off of the candy canes! (Thus - only 4 stars instead of 5!) Good Luck!",

The directions said to bake until firm but after the time specified it collapsed when I poked it so I kept it in and then it got hard on top. Even then the dough was still sticky and dense and greasy from having to grease the pan. I was barely able to get it out of the pan at all let alone in nicely sliced bars. It was a terrible mess and I'll never try that again.",

I just use the peppermint flavoring in the dough sometimes sprinkle the chopped candy canes on top of the chocolate. It's never been too sticky to work with like others have said. I just flour my hands and spread it its not difficult at all. GREAT CHRISTMAS COOKIE RECIPE!!!!",
