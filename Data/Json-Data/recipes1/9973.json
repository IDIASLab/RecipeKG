The differences are, first, that I cream the softened butter with the sugar (not melted). I add 1 tsp. lemon juice with the vanilla, and use 1 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder, and 1-3/4 c. flour. Finally, regardless of how many bananas are used it should equal 1 cup. You will never find a better banana bread, and over the course of 40 years, I've never heard differently. Edited 8/17/09: My original 4/14/08 review should have indicated that I mash the bananas, not slice them.  ",

Slicing them up, instead of mashing or pureeing them, causes them to be quite mushy and purple.  I felt like I was biting into a bruise each time I ate a slice.  I ended up digging them out before eating in order to salvage the bread.  Sorry, but I think I'll stick to mashing or pureeing...but I'll use the rest of this recipe.",

I followed the recipe as stated, with a few additions, to enhance the overall flavor of the bread. \n\nI added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp ground cloves to the batter and 1/2- 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips in addition to the walnuts. Almost all the reviewers agree that the bananas should be mashed, so I mashed them. This distributed the banana flavor evenly throughout the dough. \n\nI also advise against using a mixer for the batter. This would whip too much air into the cake and take away from its dense quality. I baked the bread at 325 and it was perfectly done in an hour and 15 minutes. It cuts easily, thinly and has a great crust. Thank you for a great recipe! ",

All you need to do is cut the top off and squeeze the banana \"pulp\" into your mixing bowl. Sweet and delicious! We also use mini cupcake pans, mini loaf pans, and the new square \"muffin\" pans with this recipe. Adjust your bake time accordingly - approx 15 for mini cakes, and 20 for mini loaves and squares. Perfect with a cold glass of milk or hot coffee or tea! Freeze well!",
