                "reviewBody": "As another reviewer suggested subbed beer for water. Also I prefer red peppers to green. I roasted this dish in the oven as follows: Placed veggies in roasting pan; pour broth mixture over veggies. Rub meat with plenty of garlic salt pepper & paprika. Place meat directly on top of veggies. Meat should not rest in liquid. (Another option place beef in another pan along side of veggies/broth.) Roast in an open pan until meat thermo. reads 150 usually 45 to 60 minutes. Remove meat only to platter; cover with foil to \"rest\" 10 min. until internal temp. reaches medium at 155. Return veggies to oven with increased temp. to 425 with red pepper added at this time. Bake until veggies are tender & lightly browned approx. 20 min. Be careful not to dry out the veggies esp. the potatoes. It may take a bit of experimenting to get them to your desired doneness. Meat is best sliced thin across the grain. It is tender & flavorful if not overcooked. Serve with sauce spooned over slice beef & veggies. Makes a great leftover beef sandwich the next day. I have been known to warm leftover beef in bar-b-que sauce for sandwiches the following day. Cook once but eat twice as a different meal is my favorite way to cook! Highly recommend this meal.",
