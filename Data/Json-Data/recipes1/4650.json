                "reviewBody": "Oh yum. The other reviewers are right this bread is very pretty. As always I made a few changes. First I used 3 T ground flaxseed and toasted it with the other seeds. There's really no point in using whole flax seeds as most of the nutrients can't be extracted through chewing and digesting alone. Using ground seeds will still give you that robust flax flavor and all of the wonderful omega-3s. You can buy ground flax seed or you can grind your own in a food processor/blender. I added 2 t of raw sunflower seeds to make up for the missing crunch from the flax seeds. Instead of honey I used blackstrap molasses (this has an unbelievable amount of vitamins and nutrients and is rather tasty) which may have given the bread a stronger flavor than with honey but it was still delicious. I put all ingredients in my bread machine and set it on the dough cycle. At the end of the cycle I put the dough in a very lightly greased clear glass loaf pan and baked it at 375 for 30 minutes. The crust was crunchy and flavorful while the interior was moist and lighter than you might think. I will definitely make this again.",

The seed combination adds a nice nutty flavor.I didn't take time to toast the seeds but other than that I did exactly as the recipe states. Didn't have to change a thing to get a beautiful loaf of very flavorful bread. As another reviewer commented this is pretty enough to give as gifts. This recipe makes me look like a skilled baker but its sooo easy my granddaughter can do it.All 12 loaves have come out perfect every time. I use the dough cycle then shape the loaf place it in a 9X5 bread pan and bake at 375 degrees for exactly 32 minutes. WoW! GREAT BREAD!!",

Wait for bubbles to form, and then add the remaining water and the oil. In another bowl mix the flour and the seeds, (I didn't wait for them to cool), and mix into the liquid to create a ball of dough. Cover with a towel and allow to rise in a warm place. The stovetop worked nicely, since the oven had been on. I left it for a half an hour and got a small loaf. I'm not sure whether it would have risen further had I waited longer, as I used regular white flour rather than bread flour, but under less hurried circumstances I'd have left it for an hour. From here I followed ItsJustaRide's baking directions. This was lovely toasted with butter for breakfast. My parents put jam on it and said it was very good, but I didn't think it needed any.",

It doesn't need any changes - you can make it just as directed and it will come out perfectly every time. If you want a variation however it is perfectly amenable to tinkering. I frequently add oat bran diastatic malt and/or sunflower seeds. I often change the bread flour to a mix of plain and whole wheat flour (although when I do this I add a tablespoon of wheat gluten to the mix and increase the yeast quantity to 2 1/2 tsp.) For a sweeter version I simply increase the honey and add a handful of currents. I bake almost all the breads my family eats; traditional artisan flat breads rolls braids you name it. That being said this is the best \"everyday\" loaf recipe I've come across and I thank Donna Beth for sharing it.",
