FREAKING. GOOD. All of us were \"mmmm-ing\" over this dessert, even my husband who swears up and down that he hates \"dreamsicles\". This is one of the best things I've had in a LONG time. NOTE: To make this a little easier to prepare, if you can soften your sherbet as much as you can without it going completely liquid and beat that in with the soft-set gelatin, then fold in the sour cream and fruit, it turns out a lot better. It dosen't get gross that way.",

Only change I made was using sugar-free jello but it was well-gelled before I beat in the sour cream and sherbet. The instructions were to beat \"...until fluffy and well blended.\" Maybe I overbeat it but it almost liquified. By the time you add together the costs of three cans of fruit a pint of sherbet a container of sour cream and two packages of jello this was not an inexpensive dessert to make and then fail. We'll end up drinking this like a smoothie so it won't go to waste but I won't be making this again.",
