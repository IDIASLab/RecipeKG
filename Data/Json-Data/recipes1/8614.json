I added the dry ingredients first (contrary to my machine's instructions) then the yeast in the corner and then the water/oil to the other corner. It's best if you do not directly scoop out your flour with the measuring cups...in other words it shouldn't be packed tightly in the measuring cups so use a spoon to scoop into the cups first. The crust is crispy and the bread is soft and light with a hint of cornmeal. Use the lightest setting on your machine.",
