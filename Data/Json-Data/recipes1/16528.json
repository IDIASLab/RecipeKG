I did not bother to steam, just rinsed it well in a pan, drained it, and left whatever water clung to the leaves to help with cooking.  I added about 1/2 cup of vegetable stock instead of water and brought it to a boil, then turned it down a bit and cooked for 7-8 minutes as directed.  I stirred a few times.  I didn't bother to drain since a lot of the liquid steamed off anyway.  I added the dressing to the hot kale in the pan to warm it up and take the edge off the raw garlic.  Then I dished it up with a slotted spoon.  The flavors were great, the preparation was very easy, and I love discovering a healthy recipe that is so tasty.",
