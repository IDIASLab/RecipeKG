However, I found myself compelled to rate this one!  I made no changes other than to add some smoked sausage links.  My husband and I were amazed at how wonderful this was!!! And, in the middle of August in California.  You'd expect this to be a winter soup, but it was wonderful at lunch time, (along with a smoked sausage sandwich).  I made enough to freeze but did not add the peas or sour cream at freezing (will do so when reheating, think that is part of the secret). Anyway, couldn't be more impressed for such a simple recipe. We had an extremely fresh head of cabbage, think that is partially what made it so good.  Make sure you make this one!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!",

Otherwise I followed the recipe and my boyfriend and I both loved it. Not only did it taste great, but it was a fantastic hangover cure as well! Will definitely make again.",
