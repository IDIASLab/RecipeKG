For me the baking time was a little long. I tested the cake at 45 minutes. As the directions do not say how to test doneness I tried the toothpick test which showed the cake was not done. After 5 more minutes the toothpick test still showed the cake wasn't done. I touched the cake top at that point and it sprang back nicely so I removed it from the oven and let it cool. This was a total of 50 minutes baking time and the cake is just a tiny bit dry. I wish I'd done the touch test at 45 minutes because I think it was probably done at that point. I wanted to top the cake with something but ended up not having time to make a frosting or ganache. I topped slices with whipped cream (from the can) and chocolate curls. This is a rather expensive cake to make as the chocolate is over 1/oz and the recipe calls for 8 oz. If I make this again I might just use 4 oz of chocolate and use chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.",

I have a similar one that calls for a cup of hot water, and I decided to add this based on other reviewers' saying that the cake was a little dry. I baked the cake for around 48 minutes in a greased 9 by 13 pan. It turned out to be very moist and delicious. I think next time I might try to bake it for a couple of minutes less.\n\nWhen I have a recipe that calls for a cake mix measuring 18.25 ounces, I buy two mixes and add 3 tablespoons to the batter with the 15.25 ounce box. That way, the finished product will remain true to the original recipe. I keep the mix from the second box in a Ziploc bag that has the slide tab in a dry place.",
