The looker to slow cook it the better the flavors will blend and the less gamey it will taste. I recommend slow cooking for 5 hours chilling overnight and then again slow cooking for another 5 hours. This maximizes flavor without making the veggies mushy. Also additional flour should not be needed if the meat is first dredged in flour before browning.",
