No pecans on hand so I omitted them. I did use Splenda brown sugar blend. This turned out nicely though the pumpkin pie spice was a little overpowering. Next time I might only use a teaspoon and a half or so instead of a whole tablespoon. Next time I'd like to try this with a little Goldfish grahams thrown in.",

The first time I forgot the vanilla but the flavor was so wonderful, I have not added it since.  Wanting to double the recipe without too much of the same cereal, I added 2 cups each of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Golden Grahams and Snyder's regular \"Snaps\" pretzels.  The Snaps are a great addition, the little squares in the pretzel hold the sugar/spice mixture perfectly and the salt gives a nice contrast.  Just because of the large amount I was making, I baked the mix in a large roasting pan at 250 degrees for 1 hour stirring every 20 minutes...then let cool completely.  Wonderful!!",
