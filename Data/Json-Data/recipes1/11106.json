I used flounder fillets instead of whole flounder (I spread the filling between two large fillets). I also used SHRIMP instead of crab because it's all I had and I was craving a stuffed fish entre\u00e9. If you don't like crab or you find it's just too expensive - shrimp makes an excellent substitute! In an effort to cut back on some fat/calories - I only used 2 T butter for the mixture instead of the 1/3 cup as called for. The mixture didn't seem as moist but once it baked with the fish - it was perfect. I also used seasoned breadcrumbs and homemade cajun seasoning (salt pepper garlic powder chili powder and paprika). I mixed a little cajun seasoning in the butter I used to rub the fillets with... Awesome recipe- thanks!!!",

I used fillets instead of the whole flounder and in the crab mixture, I added a touch of mayo.  I buttered both sides of the fillet, rolled it up with the mixture, seam side down and spinkled the top with a little Adobo and paprika.  Thanks Therese.... you make me look good!!!",

I also brushed the fish on all sides w lemon-parsley butter (1/4 cup each lemon & butter w chopped fresh parsley) The stuffing I went nuts on you may want to try this: brown the breadcrumbs in 2 Tbsp butter and put in mixing bowl sautee onions w garlic & celery I also added 7 oz imitation crab (which I usually don't like!) zest of 2 lemons 1 egg beaten 2 Tbsp of capers. Oh yeah! After placing fish on foil lined cookie sheet i mound the stuffing on top and brush it w the rest of the butter mixture. I used lite butter all throughout and a bit of olive oil for the sautee. Besides salt & pepper I just let the fresh flavors come through and it rocked. Couldn't have done it without your recipe though and I thank you for getting me to start a membership w this site.",
