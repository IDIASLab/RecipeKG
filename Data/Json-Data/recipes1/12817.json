Sometimes you get a bad batch of phyllo that rips and tears easily, so I always buy an extra just in case. I have frozen these before baking.  Just add a few minutes to cooking time when you cook them in a frozen state.  I have also doubled this recipe for large parties.",

Made the following changes - reduced salt to 1/2 teaspoon added 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice did not pre-cook cheeses and egg - instead added to cooled spinach and onion mixture. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For the reviewer looking for suggestions on shaping triangles: I used 3 sheets of phyllo per turnover brushing with butter between each layer. Cut layered sheets lengthwise with a pizza cutter into long strips. Put spinach filling at lower end of strip and fold bottom corner up over filling to side edge (at a 45 degree angle) forming a triangle - then fold triangle over to opposite edge (like folding a flag) and continue this back and forth motion. At the end seal edges with extra melted butter. Keep extra phyllo sheets covered with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out while you work. Hope this helps!",

Keep the dough covered with plastic wrap then a wet towel to keep it from drying out. Only take out what you need. I used two sheets of dough instead of one I also cut the dough (width wise) into 2 1/2 inch strips which made the triangles smaller. This was a better \"finger food\" size for the party I made them for. Also doing it this way made enough to stick in the freezer for another occasion. I think I made 100 triangles. I will make this recipe again. Thank you.",

First of all after I created the filling I added about 50 small cooked chopped shrimp. I also cut the phyllo dough into 3 equally sized long strips and used a tablespoonful of filling. In addition I used two layers of phyllo dough buttering each layer. I made these a couple days beforehand and froze them. I baked at 400F for about 18 minutes. The only thing I would do differently next time I make these is to add only 1/2 tsp of salt....otherwise this is a very very IMPRESSIVE appetizer!",
