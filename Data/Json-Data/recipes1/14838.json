Good quality balsamic is so mild you can eat it straight off a spoon and it is almost sweet. Inexpensive balsamic might as well be plain white vinegar. So don't be thrifty on the vinegar quality, you'll only regret it.",

It's a shame that the previous reviewer chose to toss the tenderloin out due to the \"vinegery\" smell, because it produced one of the better pork tenderloins ever for me.  But then, I really enjoy the flavor balsamic vinegar lends.  I say try it (if you like that strong flavor too) because I really didn't think it was overpowering at all....in taste or smell!

I also added a squeeze of honey and a clove of pressed garlic.  \nAfter marinading, i put into a 9 x 13 baking dish and poured all the marinade in with it.  I put in one large chopped onion, 4 medium yukon gold potatoes cut up, 4 carrots cut in sticks and two stalks of celery cut up.  I layed them right down on top of the marinade in the pan and kind of mixed them around a bit to soak up the juices.  I then sprinkled with rosemary, salt and pepper.  I baked on 350 for 45 min in a foil tent, then cranked up the heat to 450 and took the foil tent off.  I cooked the roast for 10 min this way, then took out to rest & wrapped in foil.  Then I stired the veggies around in the juices and then put them back in the 450 oven for about 15 more minutes.  THIS WAS FANTASIC.  Everything had a wonderful glaze to it.  The meat was moist and oh so good.  :)  Thanks for the great starter recipe! :)",

Shameful, I know.  But I say all that to say that...WOW WOW WOW.  You probably don't have to worry too terribly much about the quality or price of the vinegar.  This was SO incredibly good.  And the whole house smelled fantastic while cooking.  And my 3, 4 and 8 year olds gobbled it down, also.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and cut two yellow onions into thick slices and lined the bottom of the baking dish with them.  This was absolutely the way to go.  Those onions were perfectly cooked, drenched in the yummy sauce, and my husband and I heaped them all over the meat.  Just writing this review makes me want to go back to Trader Joe's right now to get another roast...annnnd *maybe* a new bottle of balsamic vinegar.",
