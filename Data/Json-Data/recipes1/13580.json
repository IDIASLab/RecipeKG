Aside from looking nice I don't think the candy-coated chocolate pieces worked with this recipe. And the white cake paired with the whipped topping was just not a flavorful enough. I think this recipe really needs a regular frosting to give it more taste. I love the idea of this cake though and will make it again using pink tinted vanilla frosting and more of the rainbow sprinkles on top instead of the candies.",

Maybe if we would have left the batter sit out a little bit and then put them in cupcake liners maybe that would have made a difference. We also tried to use whip topping but it spread at room temperature. It wasn't pretty. So we just another frosting recipe from the site that was neat to do when I combined 3 colors my daughter picked out to use to swirl on top. She had a blast. That's all that matters.",
