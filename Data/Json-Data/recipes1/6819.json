I reduced the cheese just a bit and used 3/8 tsp seasoned salt.  Turned out to be a little too much salt. I think a dash of hot sauce would have been great, but didn't think of it this morning. I used an 8 inch pie pan and baked for 35-40 minutes.  Original review: This is a tasty and easy recipe. I like that it is also a great recipe for making substitutions based on what I have in the frig. Today I made it with parmesean as other have suggested (NOT the powdery kind in a shaker) instead of mozzarella and used some sour cream in place of half of the milk. Also added a few chives, about 1 teaspoon summer savory, and some dried parsley to the seasonings.  Left out the ham and served it with sausage links. This is now a Sunday morning treat at our house.",

It clearly says photo 1 of 17...and many reviews state how they add thier own ingredients, making it a family favorite.  That's why we love it!  Whatever veggies or meats or cheeses are in the pantry go into the omlete!  It is a good solid recipe as is, but a great base to use up leftovers or items that are in need of use.  A frequent breakfast for dinner in our home!  And the reviewer who gave it 1 star without even trying the recipe based on the mushrooms in the photo that aren't listed in the recipe...shame on you.
