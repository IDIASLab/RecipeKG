Other reviewer is correct - undercook at least 5 minutes less!! I then flipped it over on a pillow case with powdered sugar sprinkled on the pillow case (do this slowly so sugar doesn't fly everywhere).  Roll it up in the pillow case - let it cool and then unroll and fill.  For the filling I used 1 stick of cream cheese, 1 cup powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons of soft butter & 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Roll it up and put in tin foil and chill for at least one-hour.  Put on a plate and sprinkle it with powdered suger and serve.  I serve mine with whipped cream on top of each slice and then sprinkle a little cinnamon sugare on top.  YUMMIE!!",

When I took the cake out, I sifted powdered sugar on the cake, topped it with a clean towel backed with a plastic cutting board (for support), and flipped the cake onto the towel.  (The paper stayed in the pan!)  I took it to Bible study last night and everyone loved it.  I set it out half an hour before serving to soften the chocolate a bit.",
