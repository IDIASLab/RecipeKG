Did not brown lamb, not necessary when crocking for so long. Just tossed the taters, carrots, onions,and garlic in pot. Added lamb, Then added the stock and wine mixed with spices on top of lamb.  However, I did thicken with some flour; Just turned crock on high and stired for the last five to ten minutes. Made it very thick and hearty! Served it in sour dough bread bowls...It is now an Easter tradition!!!!",

I started out with the 10 serving recipe and this year will start making it for 30 servings as my closest friends want it and their friends also want it. I had to buy a 20 quart stock pot so it could hold all the ingredients. The flavor is just fantastic and worth the time and effort it takes to make. \n\nI use boneless leg of lamb as none of the grocery stores I went to can get all the pounds of the lamb shoulder I need, but it still tastes great and even better after letting the flavors meld together for a few days in the refrigerator. I round it off with a few loaves of Irish Soda Bread. \n\nThis makes a great gift for those friends that have already bought everything they want. \n\nThanks Danny for a lifetime keeper of a recipe.",

I wish lamb was less expensive, because I would make this much more often if it were. I can't wait to make this again!",

I used just over half the amount of meat the recipe called for.  There wasn't enough available at the store. It turned out perfect!!  I was pleased with my results, it couldn't have been better.  However, the next time I made the recipe, I used the full amount - and boy did it make a difference.  It was way too much meat.  I couldn't eat very much, it was too rich.  I would suggest using less meat than is called for and more vegetables.  This is my new cold-weather dish!  When I made it for my extended family, the response was overwhelming!  Even my husband - who never gets excited about any foods  - was very vocal about his fondness of this dish.  With his thumbs-up, I knew I had a winner.  Thank you so much for sharing!",

Are you serious that step 4 \"for 20 minutes until vegetables are tender\" are correct\"? Carrots take much long to make tender in a pre-boiling pot of water alone. Sorry, unless you expect raw crunchy carrots and potato bits step 4 needs to start within 30 minutes after step 3.  Secondly, the prep time is not 20 minutes. I am marking this a 2 out 5 Stars for the prep time alone. The taste is incredible, but the aggravation of making this dish is not worth the trouble. This recipe failed for me as explained.",

Added some Rosemary and parsley seemed to give it more flavor then just the beef stock. I needed to add more liquid so put a little more wine in and a bit of water and all was good. Stew should be left to sit for a while before serving it tastes so much better warmed up!!! Oh I added a little mash potato, Every homemade stew I have had in Ireland had both. and I liked it!!!!",

I usually look here as I can find something a wee bit different to the usual fare on Irish websites. I cooked this with the wine which I found odd putting into s stew but hey I did say I wanted something different to Irish food. The recipe is perfect but God the wine ruins it. Leave it out. Traditionally we don't put any alcohol into stews. Stews came from a time when people had very little and if they had a bottle of guinness etc they certianly wouldnt have wasted it on cooking. Wine was something the Irish never had accept the upper class british here at the time so that deffinitly wouldnt have been in a stew. As I said the reipe is perfect but leave out the bitter wine and its gorgeous.",
