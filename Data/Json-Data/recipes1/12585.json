I cooked it uncovered and made a thicker gravy which I used over Risotto cooked in chicken broth and onions. Also had a side dish of red cabbage. I entertained my boyfriend and he loved it as I did.

When finished I removed the chops and added a flour and warm water mixture to make it a really good gravy. (1TBSP flour and 1/2 cup warm water) Then I poured it over the chops and served over rice.
