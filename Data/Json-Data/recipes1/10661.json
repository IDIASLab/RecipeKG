By the way, just a hint; no need to boil your noodles. Just soak them in a roasting pan filled with warm water for about thirty minutes. The noodles won't tear like they do when either trying to fish them out of the pot or draining them in a colander. This method leaves them just the right consistancy to start building your lasagna. Thanks so much!",

I used a full 28oz jar of sauce and it wasn't enough. Make sure you get more than the recipe calls for and that it's not chunky but smooth. I also used about double the amount of cheese that they called for. This was based on the given directions. With less layers the stated ingredient amounts might work.",

The spices set it and the taste is even more fantastic!",
