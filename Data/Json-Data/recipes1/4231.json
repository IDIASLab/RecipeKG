However there is no chocolaty to this. 1 Tbsp of cocoa is only enough to color it beige not flavor it nor make it chocolate tasting. The icing after boiling 5 minutes seems to reach softball sugar stage and isn't absorbed by the cake. If after cooling that changes I will update my review. Thanks Karin but I won't be making this one again.",
