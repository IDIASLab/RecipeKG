If you saute garlic too long it gets bitter. I also cooked 1 cup of elbow macaroni and added that to give it a little more substance. My wife and I liked it a lot. Changes I would make in the future would be to use fresh mushrooms rather than canned and less hot sauce. (I added more than two dashes) It was flavorful enough and the Louisiana style hot sauce has a lot of vinegar which kind of made it more sour than I would like. Perhaps red pepper flakes instead of the hot sauce. This would also be good with cheddar instead of mozzarella cheese. I will make this again.",
