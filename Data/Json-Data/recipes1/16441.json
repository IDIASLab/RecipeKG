I agree that the salad was pretty dry (is it supposed to be?  I've not had quinoa before like this - and just learned tonight that quinoa is a seed, not a grain); but with the addition of at least 1/4 cup Newman's Own Light Lime salad dressing, it was much improved.  TIP - in case you are short of time:  I read the instructions and knew the quinoa had to be chilled before adding the veggies.  However, it took much longer to chill than I expected.  So, I put it in my medium aluminum bowl, filled my large aluminum bowl with ice water, put the medium bowl into the large bowl and stirred the quinoa until it seemed cool enough to mix everything else into it.",

OK I made a couple changes because I had already thawed some salmon fillets and wanted a one dish meal. I made the recipe almost as called for except I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth I added a bag of fresh spinach at the end a bit of low fat feta and crumbled the cooked salmon on top. I also added a bit of olive oil while I mixed it all together. Seriously like something you'd get at a five star restaurant.
