Marinate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat a skillet on high heat, add shrimp, cook 3-4 minutes or until shrimp are done. Serve in warmed white corn tortillas (2 tortillas per taco - Mexican restaurants almost always double-wrap corn tortilla tacos). Garnish each taco with a slice of avocado and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro. Amazing!",

I made fresh corn tortillas and fresh guacamole as well as Best Black Beans from this site.  A fresh pico de gallo or salsa to go with it would have even been better.The fresher the shrimp the better these tacos will be. Be sure to keep moving the shrimp around so that the bottom ones do not get too done too quickly. Do not cook the shrimp too long as they will get tough.  Also use a high quality, robust flavored bacon for best flavor.  I was able to cut down the quantity of the bacon to 8 oz and still had enough flavor and pieces to go with the shrimp.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing...my husband gobbled it up and thanked me profusely.\n   ",

I really love spicy foods and have a pretty high tolerance for spicyness and the 1 pepper made this dish firey hot! I would not have enjoyed it if it was any hotter. We will definitely be keeping this recipe to use again. Thanks!",

I adjusted the recipe to make 2 servings, using about 12 ounces of peeled and deveined raw shrimp and kept them whole instead of cutting them in half.  I think I will cut them into pieces or halves the next time I make them because the tacos were a little difficult to eat left this way.  I marinated the shrimp in a little fresh lime juice and some of the minced chipotle chilies, along with some of their sauce, for about 1 hour.  After crisping the chopped bacon, I removed it from the pan and saved for topping the tacos.  I also added 2 minced garlic cloves, which I briefly saut\u00e9ed with the onion.  Then the shrimp and the rest of the chipotles went in to cook until the shrimp were perfectly pink. Along with the reserved crispy bacon bits, I also topped the tacos with chopped fresh cilantro, sliced avocado and a crema sauce I prepared using sour cream, chopped cilantro, fresh lime juice and a pinch of salt.  I found the heat of the dish just perfect.",
