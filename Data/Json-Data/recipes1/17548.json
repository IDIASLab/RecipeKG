I made up the dressing first (from the apple juice on)and dressed the wheatberries while they were still hot as I believe that they will absorb the flavors better that way. I wanted something a little less sweet a bit more \"main dish\" so I added 3 stalks of diced celery 1/2 of a large red onion diced and 1 large carrot grated. Also swapped dried cranberries for raisins pecans for walnuts and used a huge Mutsu apple (extra crisp not too sweet). Definitely a keeper!",

I made it the night before spooned out what I wanted for breakfast in a bowl topped it with 1 Tablespoon of brown sugar and 1 teaspoon of butter heated it until warm and it was great. It makes a TON so I would suggest halving the recipe. Update as of 5/22/17 I made this again as a salad following the recipe exactly and really enjoyed it AS A SALAD. Great flavors.

However I do include a couple of elements from chef Krieger's recipe. I add 2 stalks of celery and 1 scallion both finely chopped. Also if you can't find pomegranate seeds consider substituting dried tart cherries such as Montmorency cherries. They're not the same but the salad really benefits from tartness so try to keep that element as part of the dish one way or another.",

The only wheat berries that I could find were already parboiled so they only took 15 min to cook with no soaking. Make sure that you check the package for that. I am glad that I did or I would have had mush! I found that I only needed half of the wheat berries after I cooked them. The salad is great! The only thing that I would do next time is cut down a little on the nutmeg (only for personal tastes). The pomegranates really make the salad:) This recipe is great for quick healthy breakfasts and snacks. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.",
