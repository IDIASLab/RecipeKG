To make it healthier I used brown rice instead of white ground chicken instead of beef and a 28 oz. can of stewed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and ketchup. To make it more flavorful I sauteed two cloves of garlic with the onion and added 1 tsp. each of cumin and chili powder. To make it easier I sauteed the onion garlic and chicken and then dumped them and the rest of the ingredients into a crock pot on high for four hours. It was absolutely perfect the brown rice was so tender and I didn't have to worry about stirring and burning. The way to go with this recipe!",
