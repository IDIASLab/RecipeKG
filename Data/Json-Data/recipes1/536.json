It's great when such simple ingredients come together to create something so delicious!

I baked the cookies on parchment paper and they were perfectly done in ten minutes. These have a wonderful butter flavor and are great for decorating. When I was all done I placed them in clear cellophane bags tied with ribbon - too cute!",

I chilled the dough for 30 minutes before trying to roll it out but it was still very gooey and sticky. It also tore far too easily and my floured rolling pin couldn't even go one stretch before tearing it apart and getting the dough stuck to the *floured* surface.   I'm sure this is a great recipe if you have a cookie press. The doug tastes delicious. I ended up pressing it out with my hands and using cutters. This obviously gives sort of ugly uneven cookies but with the amount of butter I used i didn't want it to go to waste. We'll see how they bake!  Just a warning to other cookie press-less bakers. I was hugely disappointed. It's also kind of screwed up my Christmas party as I now only have 3 hours to finish off and offer ugly cookies! Haha.",

Yes, you should add a little confectioner's sugar to improve the taste and add to the \"melt in your mouth\" factor, as well as some brown sugar for moisture (I added 1/8 of each, 1/4 total). I also cut down on the flour. Thanks to the other reviewers, those few tweaks resulted in a blissful butter-sugar shortbread like cookie that can stand on its own. Normally my favorite cookies have chocolate involved, but honestly, these are so delicious I don't even miss it. (Hint - because this recipe is so simple, the quality of ingredients has to be good or it will ruin the flavor. I'd bet the majority of people who had issues with this recipe didn't use unsalted real butter, sifted flour, or real vanilla extract). Seriously, if you're having a cookie craving, give these a try.
