The result came out incredibly delicious - the cake was very flavorful and moist.   For the frosting, I only used 3.5 cups of powdered sugar, and it was more than sweet enough, with a nicely balanced cream cheese vs. sweet flavor. If I would change anything again, I would use less pecans - it's a bit too nutty for my personal tastes. Also, I followed another reviewer's suggestion of grating the carrots with the large grater side (the one you use for cheese) so that you don't end up with a bunch of carrot mush and juice that can't be used. Will definitely make again! This is probably the best carrot cake I've ever had.",

You are not rating the listed recipe...you are rating your own! Go ahead and submit it!(stepping down now..thanks lol)\nThat said, I forgot to pick up pecans, but added some finely chopped hazelnuts I had on hand. : )\n \n",

Cakes will sink or fall because of the following 1.Overbeating-too much air is incorporated 2.Underbaking- oven temp is too low or too short a baking time 3.Over or under measurement of ingredients 4.Using too small/large of baking pan 5. Make sure your oven temp is correct-preheat for at least 30 min. and check to make sure your oven is heating properly by using an oven thermometer for accuracy and finally, only open your oven door if you have to and then make sure 3/4 of the cooking time is up. Happy baking everyone!",

I just wasted time and money on a cake that is not good.  When you rate something high, only after changing it, you're rating \"YOUR OWN RECIPE\", not the one that is here.

I used 2 9-inch greased and floured cake pans.  I made this a week before Christmas, so I popped it into the freezer, taking it out to thaw the day before it was needed.  It was like it was fresh baked!  Then I made the frosting, using 3 C of confectioners' sugar instead of 4.  The flavor was heavenly and I still had some left over.  Everyone in the family gave rave reviews and had 2 pieces!  The cake was gone by the next day.  I will make this a Christmas tradition.",

                "reviewBody": "I made some subs: 1.5 cups brown sugar (no white), half cup oil and 1 cup crushed pineapple (drained) instead of 1 1/4 cup oil, 2.5 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 3 tsp vanilla, omitted nuts and frosting. I baked in two 9 inch round cakepans for 40 minutes instead of a 9x13 pan. The result was perfectly moist cake with terrific flavor, and less guilt! Next time, I'll double the recipe so my cakes can be a bit taller, and I'll add crushed walnuts...but I can't imagine it being much better than this. \n\nSuggestion: if you're using a box grater, grate the carrots on the 2nd largest holes (same ones you use to grate cheese). I made the mistake of grating on the next smaller size holes last time, and used 5 cups of carrots (and 1/2 cup oil - no applesauce). The carrot shreds were too small and too many, and a lot of carrot juice was produced. All that extra liquid caused my \"cake\" to be more like a thin layer of rubbery pumpkin pie filling, even after cooking for over an hour. So make sure your carrot shreds are quite large, so you don't end up with all that unwanted carrot juice.",
