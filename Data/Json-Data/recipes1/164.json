For this recipe I would recommend just scooping the flour up with the measuring cup rather than doing it the \"right\" way. That adds the little extra flour so they don't come out so flat. (I tried it both ways.) If you're new to doing cookie mix jars make sure you put the flour in first then pack it down with the bulb end of a turkey baster. Next the brown sugar then the white sugar then the chips. Pack each layer! This creates distinct layers and all the ingredients fit easily. Also make a loose funnel by rolling & taping a piece of paper. This makes it much easier to dump the ingredients in cleanly. Hope these tips help!",

The first one I layered each individual ingredient and couldn't fit the full 1 & 1/2 cups of chocolate chips in the jar. So on the rest of the jars I put the chocolate chips in 1/2 cup at a time. I put the flour 1st then 1/2 cup choc chips then brown sugar then another 1/2 cup chocolate then the white sugar and then filled to the top with the rest of the chocolate. All of the ingredients fit because the looser ingredients filter around the chocolate chips but the layers weren't really distinct. You really have to pack everything down as tight as possible. It took me about 3 hours just to fill all of the jars.",

I used a mixture of chocolate chips and red/green M&Ms for extra color -- was able to fit an M&M in each eye and nose of the snowman too! I couldn't fit all of the chocolate chips/M&Ms in the jar or lid so I wrapped the extras in a little baggie and tied it with a ribbon. To make the gift extra nice I placed the jar inside a basket lined with a holiday dish towel and matching potholders. Not only did it make a great impression the cookies turned out wonderfully too:-) Thanks for this great recipe/gift idea.",
