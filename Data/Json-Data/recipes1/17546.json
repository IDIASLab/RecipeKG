I originally told my kids it was yucky so I could have it to myself, but one of them snuck a bite, and now we all fight over it.  We *maybe* ate salmon once a year until I discovered this recipe. Now it's a weekly staple in our home. Oh, and if you forget to thaw out your salmon... we've done that too. It can still be cooked frozen. It just doesn't come out quite as yummy.  We have also tried this recipe with lemon pepper seasoning or Garam Masala. It still comes out  delish that way too! Btw, if you've never tried Garam Masala, get some , like now.
