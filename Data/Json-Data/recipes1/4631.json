Green onion instead of minced was nice because it added color along with the taste.  And I shook in a few drops of hot pepper sauce at the end along with the soy sauce.  To make nicely shaped egg \"shreds\" in the soup, stir the broth in ONE direction.  Slowly add the egg while stirring in that same direction.  ",
