I now keep an extra ice cube tray in the freezer with wine in it so I can have this whenever its hot out. I made it with both red and white wine. I preferred the red wine but hubby preffered the white. Great way to get rid of the so-so wine someone gave you for xmas. The only thing extra I did was a squirt of lemon juice. Really made a big difference.",

THE \"LADIES\" MADE WINE COOLERS (I HAPPENED TO HAVE LEFTOVER WINE ICE CUBES IN THE FREEZER - YEA!) BUT THIS TIME I ADDED CHOPPED FRUIT (I.E. LEMONS ORANGES AND LIMES). DELICIOUS!!! Pretty good even for someone who is NOT a wine drinker (at all!). My fiance enjoys wine very much but never wants to drink alone.:-) Since I made a simple red pasta sauce for dinner tonight I thought it would be a shame to not open one of our (i.e. \"his\") bottles of wine to serve with it. I wasn't wowed with the combination of the Chianti I mixed with the ginger ale but thought it was decent (and is the only way I will drink wine from now on!). My only gripe (if you can call it that) is that my wine cubes didn't freeze well. I stuck them in the freezer at 2:30 PM this afternoon and at 7:30 PM they were only semi-solid. My fiance said that alcohol takes a LONG time to freeze so I guess I'll need to plan ahead next time (or keep a supply handy). I can't wait to try this with fruity wines - strawberry peach blackberry etc. My local winery sells a variety of these kinds of wine. Now I have a reason to stock up! Thanks for sharing.:)",
