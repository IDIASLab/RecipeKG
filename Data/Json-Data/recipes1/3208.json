Because I didn\u2019t have time to chill it, I placed the eggnog in a bowl nestled on top of ice in a larger bowl.  It was an instant hit.  Things I did: (1) Added 1 & \u00bd cups of dark rum (Bacardi Black); (2) Placed the mixing bowl (for whipping the cream) in the freezer for approximately 20 minutes prior to using \u2013 it helps the cream thicken faster with the hand-held blender; and (3) Sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg on top. Will definitely use the recipe again.  [2009 Note: I now use a blender (which is better than a hand-held mixer to thoroughly blend the eggs). In a blender add the eggs, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla, and a generous splash of the milk and blend well. Then pour into a large punch bowl and add the rest of the milk (and rum) and mix. Continue with step 2 from there.] Happy holidays\u2026ho, ho, ho.",

I received a ton of compliments on this - the best coming from my coworkers from India who had never had it before! They each asked for the recipe to send home. The eggnog came out smooth creamy and quite delicious. I did not add any nutmeg but set out ground nutmeg cinnamon and whipped cream for people to add to their own taste. I'll be making this again and again! Thanks!",

I heated the eggs, condensed milk and salt on a very low heat until it was about 160 degrees.  Then I stirred in the milk and folded in the whipping cream as directed.",
