It made a ton of cookies (I think I got 6 or seven dozen out of the recipe) and I divided up the dough and added lemon to some of it cinnamon to some and coconut to some. It was like having a cookie variety in one recipe! I will make this recipe regularly now and I cannot thank you enough for bringing a little taste of my grandma back to me! Your recipe was a wonderful gift to me. Many thanks.",

These cookies filled the bill to a \"S\"or Sprinkle!! She helped me make the entire batch of dough in my stand mixer. But the main event is sprinking the dough with all colors of SPRINKLES!! Not the world's best cookie but certainly tasty enough!! Makes a lot!! Also liked the other suggestions about dividing the dough and giving each batch a different flavor. Will try the lemon.",
