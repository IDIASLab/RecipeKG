I can see that you would have to chop and drain the good quality bag or jar kraut you find in the deli or dairy case, in a strainer overnight and also use good deli corned beef shredded for best results.\r\nThe dressing/cheese topping is what makes it really yummy so don't skimp, but don't overdo either. I would use REAL mayonnaise and good name brand Thousand Island. NO nonfat stuff, that is what gives it flavor!",
