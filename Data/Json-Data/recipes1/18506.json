I sauteed the onions and aromatics as directed in step 4 and added to the crockpot along with the ingredients in step 5, and the black beans in step 6. I roasted the sweet potatoes while the chili was cooking and added them to the crockpot at the end to heat through. \n\nI didn't reduce the water in the recipe, and the amount of liquid at the end of the cook time was just right. To add more body to the chili, I smashed some of the beans up right in the crockpot to fill it out some. Sometimes when making chili if I remember, I reserve a 1/2 cup or so of the rinsed beans to smash and add when the chili is about done. I usually forget though and just smash in the pot. \n\nI served this with a pan of cornbread and topped the chili with fresh cilantro and a little shredded cheddar.",

The second time I cooked it the only thing I changed was that instead of putting a teaspoon of sugar in the chili I put about a tablespoon of sugar on the sweet potatoes before I roasted them. This helped them brown and caramelize a little more. It came out great!",
