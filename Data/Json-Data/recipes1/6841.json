Second I used penne pasta instead of spaghetti. And finally I added a cup of broccoli florets. Mmmm served with garlic toast and a salad this was wonderful. Oh yes...instead of baking it in the oven (its just too hot for that) I cooked it on high in the microwave 5 minutes and added a little milk when stirring the cheese in. Simply a fantastic dish even my husband the devoted carnivore loved it.",

I skipped the lemon zest and without it this had just the desired fresh, delicate hint of lemon. The baking method didn\u2019t appeal to me.  I saw that as an unnecessary step that would just take extra time.  I wanted to keep it simple and I wanted the dish to be creamy and saucy, so I simply prepared the sauce, adding some fresh minced garlic to the melted butter, then finished the sauce as directed before tossing it with the pasta (I used pappardelle, a sort of wide fettucine).  We really enjoyed this, particularly alongside \u201cGrilled BBQ Meatloaf,\u201d also from this site, and Brussels sprouts with bacon.",
