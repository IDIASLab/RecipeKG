That's OK; I'll admit this rice recipe doesn't have a great deal of \"kick\" on its own; it's not supposed to. Then again a lot of the meats I serve tend to have a lot of herbal-spicy goodliness going on in them and in order to not overpower my guests I serve this as a counterpoint. Absolutely there are times I also add a bit of dried red pepper flakes or even lots of roasted garlic to this recipe -- but it's flexible that way. Thanks for your review:)",

I used a garlic oil I had on hand and added some frozen chopped spinach to it while cooking. I also used brown rice which required some extra water while cooking and took about twice as long to cook. My 3 yr old and 5 yr old really enjoyed it especially the 3 yr old who came back for a heaping seconds! Thanks! I will be keeping this one!",
