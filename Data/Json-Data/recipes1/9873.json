The other recipes that do not have you put the rice in the albondigas are not even nearly authentic real albondigas have rice inside! There are several ways to change this a little like I said put jalepeno slice inside add a can of chipotle peppers to the sauce add what ever soup veggies you want. I like to serve mine with tortilla chips like crackers and chicken noodle soup. Gracias por este receta!",

The potatoes I used were \"Red Gold\" (supposed to be \"excellent for boiling\") the rice was long-grain and the flour was \"unbleached flour\" (it didn't say \"all-purpose\" but I guess that's implied). I found that the amount of flour was too much even though I thought I coated the meatballs well with it; maybe 1/3 cup would have been enough. I made this once with 90% beef and once with 96%; I thought 90% would add a bit of fat to the soup but it was too much; 96% worked great. I simmered the second stage for 1 hour but the potatoes were still slightly underdone and some of the meatballs still a little pink inside. The meatballs tasted great but the broth was pretty bland; it was better the next day though. I might make this again but perhaps substituting broth for some of the water and maybe adding another vegetable or two.",
