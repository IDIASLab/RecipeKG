I used a slightly spicy Italian sausage and also added mushrooms. It actually turned out pretty good! A little oily but that is to be expected given my ingredients. I didn't have as many potatoes as it called for so my version would have been good with maybe rice or more potatoes. I served it with veggies and cheese bread. My husband also said it would make a great breakfast recipe if we added eggs. I'm anxious to try it again with the correct sausage or maybe Kielbasa. Thanks!",
