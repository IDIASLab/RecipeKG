I didn't measure the cups of ice cream - just took giant scoops out of the carton and dumped them into the blender. As for the milk I changed two things: I used 1/2 a cup instead of a whole and I used 4% milk instead of regular. The chocolate syrup all floated down to the bottom and sat underneath the blades but that was okay - I just drizzled it on top of the shake when it came out last. If it had mixed in it probably would have been too chocolatey. I LOVED this shake - not too thick not too thin not too chocolatey. The best!",
