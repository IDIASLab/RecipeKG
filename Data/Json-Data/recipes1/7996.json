I used rice chex and was surprised at how many people never heard of using cereal in meatloaf before; it is common in west central PA. I baked it on a cookie sheet and put a small cooling rack on the cookie sheet and the meatloaf on top of that. This way the grease drips off the meatloaf and onto the cookie sheet (and you can line the sheet with foil for easy clean-up!) I did not reserve any of the ketchup/br. sugar mixture but mixed it all in and it was very moist and tender. I mixed mustard ketchup and worcestershire sauce and spread it on top before I baked it. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE! I'll make this again and again.",

Changes: didn't have Worcestershire sauce added tiny pieces of red & yellow bell pepper zucchini leeks- all in small amounts. I had to sneak in those veggies! I did not use mustard pepper or garlic salt (used herbed croutons instead). I didn't have cereal and used small amount of herbed croutons and quick oats equal to that called for in the recipe. Turned out great nonetheless and the smell is delish. Next time I will try with Worcestershire sauce. I cooked it in a 9x5 glass container- it shrank and released a lot of liquid- easy to dump. However it was moist. If you cut the pieces too small it will fall apart. No biggie.",
