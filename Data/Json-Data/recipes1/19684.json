As I thought it was out of my comfort zone with adding cranberries to a savory dish...Little did I realize what a treat it was. The pairing of bison with the cranberries was fantastic. During the cooking process the berries broke down and melded with the broth meat and herbs and it made an excellent addition to my family's dinner. One bowl was left after everyone sat down to eat and really raved that it was quite delicious. I've used ground bison before and this was a 1st using it in tender cuts of roast. I will so be buying it as a great dinner treat for my family. This recipe was exceptionally wonderful meat was tender the broth and vegetables were over the top awesome! The recipe as a whole was just outstanding. If I had enough for the family to have leftovers for another dinner they would be gone right now;-) thank you for allowing me to be apart of making this meal. It's a winner!",

We followed the recipe exactly. The bison was delectable and extremely tender. The cranberries added a unique flavor and depth but you have to be sure to cook it for the prescribed time otherwise the cranberries taste like barf (we tried them half way through). Overall a very satisfying interesting and healthy meal. Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow.",

I cooked it as directed but then after the two hour cook time it went into a crockpot on warm for about 5 hours. It tasted MUCH better after the 5 hours than it did at the two hour point. I will make it again but I won't coat the meat in flour before browning. I will grown the meat and onion together in the oil then without draining the fat I'll make a roux with a bit of added butter and some flour then I will add the liquids and add the meat back to simmer for 1.5 hours then add the carrots and celery for 30 min. Then I would mix the beef broth and flour and stir in as much as needed to reach the desired consistency. Doing it this way (without coating the meat before browning) results in a much smoother liquid with a nicer appearance.",
