I've made this recipe many times and find that 2/3 cups lemon juice (juice of 3 large lemons) gives this the perfect tartness. (add 1 extra tablespoon flour if using 2/3 cup juice)  I also added the zest of 2 of the lemons.  I made this in an 8 X 11 dish (smaller than what the recipe calls for) and found it ideal.  The crust is the perfect thickness and there is enough lemon custard in each bite to satisfy.  This recipe makes a lot of crust and does spread into a 9 x 13 dish easily, but makes a thinner bar.  If using the smaller baking dish (i.e, 8 X 11), make sure to increase cooking time of the crust and filling an extra 5-10 min each.  As another reviewer stated, it's better to overcook then undercook the crust.  Also, add 1/4 teaspoon salt to the crust for more flavor.  This will be my master recipe for Lemon Bars.",

                "reviewBody": "I have made two other recipes of lemon bars and on both of them the end result was that the liquid filling kind of melted in with the crust. On this recipe however, you can see a nice shortbread crust that was about 1/4 inch thick and 1/4 inch of the filling on top of that. I increased the lemon juice by one more large lemon and got about 3/4 of a cup of lemon juice. I also zested two of the lemons and added that to the liquid filling before cooking. I love it super tart, but I think most people might like it better a little less, so I would suggest using 1/2 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice. Also,I let the crust cool for until it was just room temperature. To speed this up I put it in front of a fan for about 15 min. and it worked great. Then when the crust was cooled down I poured the liquid filling over it. I cooked the crust first for 20 min. then when  returned it to the oven with the filling, I cooked it for about 25 min. I ate some after it came out of the oven, but about 4 hours later, after being in the fridge, they were the perfect consistency. A nice firm crust, and the filling was like a really firm pudding that held its shape. I also added a teaspoon of salt to the crust recipe. I made mine in a 9 x 12 pan. Next time I am going to double the recipe so that the crust is thicker and their is a thicker amount of filling on top.",

Using other's suggestions, I tried it again using the juice of 5 lemons (a little over 2/3 cup) and the zest of two lemons. I also added 1/3 c. flour to compensate for the extra liquid.  I also had to increase the bake time to about 24 minutes.  These turned out GREAT with the extra lemon (and, of course, powdered sugar on top).  I also added a dash of salt to the crust and thought it was divine.  These weren't anything flashy or out of the ordinary...just exactly what lemon bars should taste like.",

I wanted to give Patty 5 stars for a perfect base recipe to start from.  After reading reviews, i just knew that Patty's original recipe wasn't going to have enough filling, nor be lemony enough to satisfy my lemon craving.  So here are the small changes I made to quell the lemon monster:  kept shortbread recipe as is, but added 1 tsp lemon zest.  Doubled the filling recipe, using a total of 1 1/4 cups fresh squeezed lemon juice and added an extra 2 Tbsp flour.  Cooked crust to recipe instructions, but needed to extend the filling cook time to 30 minutes.\nEveryone loved these bars!  I was told that they beat anything you'd find at a specialty bakery.  That's saying something, folks!\nHowever, credit MUST go to Patty!  Her recipe started it all!",
