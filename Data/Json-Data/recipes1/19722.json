I did make changes only because my family is not too fond of blue cheese so I substituted the dressing with ranch since when we eat chicken wings we eat them with ranch.  These were such a hit that I made them the very next day and will be making them as an appetizer for Super Bowl.  I will be making tons!!!!!! Everyone should at least try this recipe out if you love chicken wings and nachos you will definitely love this recipe!!!! Thank you for sharing this deliciousness with all of us I will definitely continue making these for the whole family  and friends.",
