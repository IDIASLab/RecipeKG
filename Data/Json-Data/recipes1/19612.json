I don't like coconut so I used almond extract instead (vanilla would be good as well) and I sliced the strawberries into a floret and stuffed them...makes for a really pretty presentation and allows you to stuff them with more filling.  Next time I will cut the milk back to 2/3 cup as the filling was a little on the thin side and didn't set as nicely as I would have liked.  Was a bit better after putting the piping bag in the fridge for awhile but I think a tad bit less milk will make it perfect for nicely formed piped rosettes.  Taste was delicious and I will definitely make again!",
