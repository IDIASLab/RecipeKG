It's a bit more difficult to make than what you might think, despite the easy ingredients, and it can be a little time consuming with the layers.\n\nThese are the only changes I would make to this recipe: Allow it to set overnight, as opposed to only 4 hours. I would recommend freezing the pie prior to serving for easy cutting & aesthetic presentation. I also topped each slice off with an Oreo cookie. Delicious!",

Instead make the pudding layer then the cool whip put it in the fridge for a half hour and then put on the third layer bic if not it can get messy.
