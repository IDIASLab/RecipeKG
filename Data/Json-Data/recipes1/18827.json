Something about the okra being fried in the cornmeal that really sets it off. I have also used this same recipe with out the corn muffin mix just using corn meal and flour. Wanted fried okra and didn't have the corn muffin mix. Fried okra is just good eating. oH, the Yukon Gold  potatoes are fine but I have used what ever potato I have on hand and works great.
