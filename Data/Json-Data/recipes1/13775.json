I did use whole wheat flour but so do other reviewers and my bread came out looking exactly as the main photo does. I see that most people really liked it so I am open to possibly doing something wrong but I don't think I did. I understood this was going to be a dense bread but to me the bread tasted like dough or flour not bread. The texture was clay-like but perhaps it is supposed to be. I knew it would be different than sour-dough or yeast raised bread and was surprised I did not like the flavor as well as the texture. I tend to like a wide variety of things and am open to it. Many reviewers seem to have experience with this bread including from childhood and the good associations with remembering eating it. I can't say whether or not the \"spice\" of nostalgia has helped their result taste better than mine. The only other baking soda-leavened bread I've eaten before is Irish Soda bread and I've only had it a few times. I give it two stars not one in case it was something I did. There's not a big loss if you try the recipe anyway-most people have the ingredients always around. Who knows maybe you will like it?",
