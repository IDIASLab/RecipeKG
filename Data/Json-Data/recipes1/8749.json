Be sure to pat dry the olives to remove as much liquid from them as possible.  This helps when they sit for a while so they don't get too 'doughy'.  I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder to the flour before mixing in the butter and cheese.  I like the taste the garlic adds to this recipe.",
