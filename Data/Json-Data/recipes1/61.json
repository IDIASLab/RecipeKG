When you press the cereal mixture into pan, use a flat metal lasagna spatula sprayed lightly with cooking spray and press mixture down firmly.  Another good tip is to spray cooking spray into measuring cup for adding corn syrup!  It slides right out!  Also, line measuring cup for peanut butter with plastic wrap and there is no mess!",

Make sure you use a double boiler for melting as the butterscotch chips just don't melt very well in the microwave.  Very good but try my version!",
