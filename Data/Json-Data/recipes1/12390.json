I used fresh crushed garlic fresh and dried basil fennel seed white pepper and a pinch of hot pepper flakes. And less salt. I used part skim mozzarella to bring down the fat content and instead of canned mushrooms I used a pound of fresh sliced mushrooms. The many layers shown here by keeping the mushrooms sauce and sausage mixture separate seemed too time consuming so I mixed those together and my layers were simply pasta sauce cheese repeat. I also added some fresh chopped parsley to the top before baking it for 25 minutes. We really enjoyed it with a loaf of french bread and it makes lots - I'm happy to have yummy leftovers!",

I made extra sauce by using a 28 oz. can tomatoes (ran them through the food processor) and an extra 8 oz. tomato sauce adding extra seasonings as well. I also used fresh mushrooms and just sliced them and cooked them in the sauce. Instead of layering everything I just mixed the cooked pasta together with the sauce and layered that with the cheese (using lots more cheese than called for). I ended up with two layers of sauce/cheese. I was looking for something very saucy and cheesy and that was pretty much perfect!",

If everything is already cooked and fairly warm it should only take 15-20 minutes in the oven. It came out very dry and near the edges the macaroni was crunchy. Definitely would be better with a lot more sauce and less time in the oven.",

I don't use the canned tomatoes or sauce I find that Clasico brand Spagetti bottled sauce is best because it's a little chunky and good flavor. I always double the recipe and make two portions freezing one. In the process I probably use about 4 or 5 bottles of sause (28oz - I think).",

The changes I made after reading the reviews was to use only 1/2 the amt. of pasta (I was cooking for 3) 1/2 the amount of sausage but used the full amount of onions (omitted the celery) used one can of mushrooms used a 28 oz jar of speghetti sauce the full 8 oz. of mozzarella and parmeasan cheese. I also just mixed everything together except for the parmeasan which I added to the top as directed. It turned out perfectly - I was told it was the best ziti I had ever made and I agree. If you are going to do the recipe for 8 servings I agree with most of the others - you will need more sauce. Thanks submitter!",
