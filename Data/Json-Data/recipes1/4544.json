Additionally, from years of trial and error I have found that when you divide the dough and spread the strawberry jam on top if you place it in the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes it will help make putting the dough on top a whole lot easier since the cold jam will not shift around so easily.  Then all you have to do is let it return to room temperature and then bake.  Its one more step but its worth it.  Thanks LindaK for passing on this recipe. I'm sure a lot of other families will pick it up as a tradition!",

I didn't have strawberry jam so I used blackberry jam. Very good!!!!....................................... I am updating this review. I just made these with Solo apricot filling and they were awesome. I want to try with the Solo nut fillings next. I also forgot the vanilla and they were still good. Great recipe. Updating one more time...I now make this with my homemade damson plum jam or strawberry rhubarb jam. My two favorite flavors!",

I think I should have prebaked the bottom a little bit before adding the jam and top. And even though it add little cardamom I preferred the flavor before it was baked. After just wasn't to my liking...totally sorry.",
