It overpowers both the honey and the mustard.  Try reducing it by half, at least.\r\n\r\nI used dijon mustard by the way.  The chicken was tender (I let it bake the full 45 minutes, gas oven.)  This recipe is quick to prepare and tastes upscale for a mid-week meal.  I am definitely going to make it again.",

I marinated my chicken for 3 hours and added more sauce than recommended, which proved to be fruitful for the flavor of the chicken.  (Marinating overnight is even better!)  I also, like others before me, used 1/2 dijon mustard and 1/2 regular mustard.  I also used soft flavor/tasting honey to make sure the mix wouldn't be too sweet.  It would be nice to have the chicken taste a bit more tangy and maybe lemon juice would be helpful.  My husband and dinner guests gobbled this up!  :)",

You can also buy prepared Honey Dijon dressing or mustard if you are in a rush. The next tip is to marinate your chicken breasts in the Honey mustard. Its best to marinate overnight but in the morning is fine too.",
