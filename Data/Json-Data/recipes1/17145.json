Also the pieces of elk I used were about the size of a deck of cards and about 3/4 inches thick. I also didn't have to soak the meat to rid it of a gamey flavor (we hang the meat for two weeks before cutting it up to remove the gamey flavor). For this recipe I doubled everything (except the elk and bacon) placed it all in a zip lock bag and marinated it over night. It smelled wonderful in the marinade! I then skewered the steaks with a piece of bacon. I opted not to wrap each piece of meat with bacon so as to lower the calorie and fat content. I served the meat with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and it was wonderful! I'm going to try this recipe with our antelope next. Just a note I was concerned about there not being any added salt in the recipe but with the liquid smoke worcestershire sauce and bacon it wasn't needed. Wonderful recipe that I will use again and again! Thanks for sharing!",

I made this for my Dad with his elk and we used the tenderloin and followed the directions exactly. The only thing we did differently is cook on medium high for less time and it all came out medium to medium well. In hindsight for a good medium rare I would cook on medium for about five minutes or less each side just until the bacon is nice and crispy. We both loved it and will make this again and again!",
