I health it up a bit and use ground turkey, my own homemade taco seasoning and I add chopped organic peppers and sometimes shredded carrot or zucchini to the taco meat. You can even sub half organic black beans for half the meat or double it to include the black beans in the taco meat to really make it stretch for a big family (or big eaters, like mine!). I also make my own salsa to go over the top. This can be made \"lighter\" with lowfat cheese and fat free sour cream without much difference in flavor. Try this with organic flavored taco chips, too! Even better!",
