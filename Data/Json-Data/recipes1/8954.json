Our oven doeesn't have a broiler so I did what another reviewer said and roasted the peppers over my gas stove top which worked nicely. Poblano peppers are not very spicy to begin with they are a step above bell peppers in regards to heat. However when you roast any pepper over a flame the flavor is intensified so it does seem to have more spice. I enjoyed this soup I love the taste. I did not add the salt (I don't like a lot of salt in my food) but I wish I had added a dollop of sour cream as others suggested. I'll give that a try next time. Thanks MARBALET.",
