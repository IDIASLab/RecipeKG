All it requires to omit the machine is putting the dry ingredients together, including the dates (I used dried and pitted rather than fresh), and then adding the water/oil/honey/yeast mixture (after the yeast has been activated) to it. I kneaded it for about 10 minutes and then let it rise twice for about an hour each time in our microwave with a cup of boiling water beside it to help it rise. Baked it at 350 for ~35 minutes or so. Great bread! I'll make another batch soon!",

It's highly sweet so watch out if you haven't got a sweet tooth. The recipe is easily adapted to incorporate other dried fruit such as pears or figs. If you want to be able to find any chunks of date in the bread I'd recommend ignoring the beeps and adding the fruit only about two minutes before the end of the kneeding otherwise the blade tends to just smooth them into the bread.",
