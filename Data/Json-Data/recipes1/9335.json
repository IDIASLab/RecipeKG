The crust was always a bit tricky but this is the most perfect crust for frying easy to make and handle and best tasting yet. The apricots we used came from the largest tree in Las Vegas..two stories high and at least4 ft around and probably a few decads old. The best apricots I have ever tasted grew on it.  We cooked them down with sugar till we had a sweet thick puree for the pies.  But I have to say using the dried fruit is supurb. I love this recipe and fry them in a deep fryer..wrap them in paper towels and put them in a shoe box in the frig..just like she showed me.  Thank you so much for this great recipe. Its a real keeper",

Wonder if you could use this crust for regular pies that are baked?\r\nI had my own filling...I always cut up my apricots into smaller pieces.  I spray a pair of sissors with vegetable spray and cut each dried apricot into 4 pieces.  Place in water to cover and simmer until falling-apart tender...then I add the sugar and other seasonings.  I use minute tapioca as a thickening agent.  A tablespoon or two will do great.  Allow to stand at room temp until cooled and the filling will thicken.",

Crust was excellent but I rolled my crust a little thicker and made 13 pies instead of 18...and the filling was perfect...I stuff my pies a little thicker. I also used only apricots instead of the apricot/peach mixture. I dabbed a little cold water on the inside edges and it prevented the pies from opening during the fry process. Very enjoyable!!!",

Probably four feet around...they cut it down years later and put a bank where their house once stood. Vegas will never be the same! She gave me my first taste of fried pies and I was hooked. I never could make them as good as hers. She was a fantastic cook and taught me a lot. That was over 40 yrs. ago. She used a basic pie crust and fried them in an electric skillet. Mine always were pretty good but I was never satisfied with the crust. It was difficult to work with and fry. Yours is awsome. Answer to my prayers. And using the dried fruit is even better than fresh. Milk makes the crust great for frying and holds it all together giving them a great texture and flavor. I use a deep fryer and they come out crisp and not oily. I pack them in a shoe box and paper towels in the frig. Just the way she did. They don't last long. I heard these little pies originated on the covered wagon trail because they could carry dried fruit flour and of coarse a cow. Thank you so very much for a Great recipe.",
