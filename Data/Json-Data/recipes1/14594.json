(After cooling and tasting, I put it into a pan and baked it at 250 for 45 minutes, and then it was much, much better.) The long, slow cooking of the old recipe blends the flavors and crisps the cereal and nuts into a snack mix rather than just seasoned cereal. The microwave version tastes as good as the bagged Chex mix, but if you want it better than that, bake it at 250 for about an hour, stirring every 15 minutes or so. Pecans are a great addition if you use the slow bake method.",

However, I double all the seasonings, but not the butter, and use whole grain Cheerios instead of the garlic bread things.  I also add quite a bit of Tabasco and cayenne.  Taste the seasonings mixed with the butter before you add the cereals and make sure it tastes spicy - it will be a lot milder once mixed and cooked.  I also cook in the oven at 250 for an hour, stirring every 15 minutes,  instead of cooking in the microwave.  It is MUCH better after cooling on the newspaper covered with paper towels than fresh out of the oven.",

When i make it, i use whole boxes of cereal (my family likes one box each of corn and rice Chex, one box Crispix, and one small box Cheerios. Of course the small pretzel sticks(1/2 bag), one can cashew halves, one can fancy mixed nuts,without peanuts(otherwise the whole batch tastes like peanuts) 12T. butter,4T. lemon juice, 9T. Worchestershire, 1 T. each onion and garlic salts.  Mix all cereals,nuts,pretzels in a large roaster pan. Melt butter and add rest of seasonings, re-warm in mw and mix well so salts are dissolved. Pour over mix in pan, stir well, bake for 45 min. 250 degrees, stirring every 15 min.  Cool really well...I put it outside in the winter so it cools and stays crisp. Freeze in zip bags and use as needed. Enough to take to gatherings and give as gifts.  Enjoy!",
