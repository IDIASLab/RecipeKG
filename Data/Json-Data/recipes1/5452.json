I soaked the sun dried tomatoes in the olive oil along with 2 cloves of minced garlic and two pinches of rosemary.  I chunked the chicken before cooking and added extra olive oil to saute it.  After sauteing the chicken I added the tomatoes with oil, garlic, and rosemary, the zucchini and yellow squash, and a chunked red pepper.  When I added the pasta to the pan I also added enough chicken consomme to coat the entire dish, heated it through, and then added grated Locatelli cheese to the top.",

It was a wonderful light tasting recipe. My husband loved it leftovers were just as good as the first day and we I will make again and again!",

I microwaved zucchini slices, carrot slices and some fresh brocoli  florets until crisp tender.  I then sauted them in EVOO with 1/2 of a sweet onion  cut in 2 inch slices, a red pepper in 2 inch pieces, and a few baby bella mushrooms, sliced.  I added 2 minced cloves of garlic, chicken chunks that I had left over from a rotissarie chicken.  I added sliced sun-dried tomatoes with a little bit of the oil they were packed in.  Finally I added a couple of tablespoons of evoo to the pasta, mixed it all together and added some grated parmesan and sprinkled a small handfull of shredded mozerella.  It was fabulous, restaurant quality.  My family loved it.  We will definitely have this again.",

I added some garlic and allowed to cook. Then I added some halved cherry tomatoes a chopped summer squash sliced mushrooms and chopped spinach. Allowed to cook added some salt pepper and oregano. Then combined it (including the juices) with some penne pasta (all that we had) and mixed it all together with a little crumbled feta cheese. It was great! The turkey bacon really added to it. You could also use proscuitto or pancetta which I think would be even more delicious if less good for you.",
