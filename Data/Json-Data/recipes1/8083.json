Because I read a complaint about the fish becoming soggy due to sitting in so much butter during cooking I cooked all the garlic and butter in the same pot and just spooned a small bit of the mixture over the fish prior to cooking. The fish still absorbed the garlic flavor but it was not soggy at all. I also used probably close to 3 tsp of garlic though. Even though I used larger steaks (both were about 1 inch thick and 8 oz) the cooking time was still long enough. The \"sauce\" ended up being WAY too much for just 2 steaks. I think it probably would have been enough for 4 steaks however we ended up eating it all anyway. I filled some pita bread with feta cheese sliced olives and the remaining sauce and it was delicious. My husband and I both think that my pita bread creations were what really made the meal.",
