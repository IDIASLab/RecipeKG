If you are feeding people from Louisiana plan on 8 pds of Crawfish per person, elsewhere plan on 6 pds of Crawfish per person.  Not a bad recipe ingredients wise, but the cooking times are way off.  The recipe is best if you combine liquid and powdered Crab/Shrimp Boil as the seasoning for the water.  (To that size pot add one cup of liquid Crab/Shrimp boil not a tbsp).  The vegetables added are ok, there are numerous variations of what vegetables you can add as long as you stick with the main ingredients- onions, garlic, and lemon.  You should add your liquid and dry seasoning combination along with the onions, garlic and lemon and let bring to a boil for 10 min.  Add potatoes and corn (normal size corn on the cob cut in half or use frozen corn on the cob, remember to defrost before cooking) and cook for 10 min at a low boil not a simmer. Add your other vegetables and cook for 5 min then return the water to a full boil and add the Crawfish and cook per the following directions:  Once you add the Crawfish to the boiling water, return the water to a boil, cook for 7 to 8 min.  Immediately complete this next step, it is the difference between good Crawfish and GREAT Crawfish!!  Once you turn the fire off after the 7 to 8 min boil time, place a 2 to 3 inch layer of ice in the pot.  Yes, I said ice! (the pot size will determine how much ice you will need).  Cover the pot and let the Crawfish soak for 15 min.  If you have a strainer i",

We are all about the 'craw-dads' and sausage and could do w/o the other items in the pot, but we do add corn and potatoes. We've never added mushrooms, artichoke or other veggies. We do add celery stalks to the pot and a heaping bit of cayenne pepper. From time to time we also add turkey necks.

WHAT A HIT!!!  We modified it only slightly - we used a large turkey fryer to cook in.  We didn't add the artichokes, we only cut onions in half vertically (didn't slice them), we used 8 large ears of sweet corn (each broken in half) and we used 6 pounds of raw shrimp instead of the crawfish.  After working through the recipe and cooking everything but the sausage & scrimp, we dumped the first ingredients into a large tin pan (about 15\" x 24\"), then cooked the sausage and shrimp in the same liquid.  Wehn they were done we dumped the sausage and shrimp on top of the veggies.  What a great looking meal and everyone raved about how good it was, and how much fun it was to eat.  We put out 3 pan for everyone to dump the peels and cobs in and ate off of paper plates.  We'll definately do it again.  Thanks for the great recipe!!",
