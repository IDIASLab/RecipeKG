It was delicious.  I would definitely recommend adding the spices - garlic, thyme, bay leaf.  Everything else according to recipe was perfect.",

I sauteed the chicken with a little salt and pepper before adding to soup and I added a little bit of extra rice.  My husband loved it and commented on how wonderful and homey it smelled after walking in from the cold.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!",

I wanted more veggies, so I added 1/2 a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and omitted the carrots (since they are in the bag).  I had to add a little more chicken bouillon as I found the broth a little weak.  It's very bland even after adding some basil and thyme.  Although I appreciate its ease, I won't be making this again.",
