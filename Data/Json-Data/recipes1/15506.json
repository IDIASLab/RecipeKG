My husband is preparing to run his first marathon so I've been carbing him up all week. I did not have cream of broccoli so I used cream of chicken instead. I read in the other reviews that it was a little bland so I added some paprika sage and pepper...that seemed to do the trick! I also seasoned some chicken tenderloins with the same spices (and a bit of salt) and broiled it while everything else was cooking since I didn't have chicken in a can. Once I put everything together it was very tasty and flavorful!",
