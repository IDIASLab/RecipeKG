I bought a bag of pre-shredded hash brown potatos and fried them up before stuffing the burgers so I wouldn't have to worry about the potato cooking all the way through it also added that yummy fried potato flavor! I've made these with lots of different variations for fillings but my favorite is potato cheddar and crumbled bacon. My boyfriend's favorite is the original potato/mushroom/swiss. Any fillings work well for this burger so get creative! I gave my sister this recipe and she makes hers with cream cheese avacado and sundried tomatoes yum!",
