As for those who who gave this recipe less than great reviews...I wonder if they ever have had a REAL homemade pound cake? This recipe has the texture, density and crumb that a\"pound cake\" should have. For those having problems...check your oven accuracy and mixing methods. Remember there are none of the usual leavenings added. This cake depends on air beat into the fats and eggs in order to rise properly. For those who did not have cake flour...take 2 tablespoons of flour from each cup of all purpose flour to substitute for cake flour. I rate this pound cake as the epitome of all pound cakes. Just a review from a professional baker :-)",

I read all of the reviews/suggestions at least twice and incorporated many of them into my attempt and I am very happy with the results.  It's lovely and everyone loves it!  I used 2.5 cups of sugar as many people recommended.  My husband said the sweetness and moisture level was exactly right.  I used all-purpose flour instead of cake flour and subtracted a total of 6TB from the 3 cups, as per the conversion others gave (thank you!).  I decreased the almond extract to 1/2 tsp and added an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla (total of 1-1/2 tsp).  I creamed the butter, cream cheese, sugar for five minutes on medium/medium high on the Kitchen Aid stand mixer and it ended up a soft off-white color (like the color of Bisquick).  The batter was beautiful indeed, as someone else mentioned.  I divided and baked in two 9x5 loaf pans for one hour and 10 minutes at 325 and my cakes were perfectly done.  The cakes did not actually \"fall\", but the delicious crusty top that had arched up during baking caved back down after removing from the oven to a flat level - so the side profile of the cake was rectangular, not arched on top.  No harm at all.  This recipe is a winner.  I can't wait to try lemon extract and various flavored icings!  Thank you!  ",

Baked in a bundt pan, but the cake fell too much after cooling.  I find baking in  2 large loaf pans is best.  Definitely overmixing is a must for this recipe.  Since this has no leavening agents, you must beat air into the butter and cream cheese until is very pale and fluffy - about 5-7 min. As well as mix well after each egg is added.  Don't peak during baking or the cake will fall.  One thing I don't like about this recipe is th appearance on the inside.  The uneven discoloration as you see in the picture that's posted.  It looks like it's uncooked even though it is.  I like a more uniform look.  But this is very moist, just cut back the sugar.",

I think both are great, but the almond does add that extra \"mmmmm\" factor. I made it both times in 2 loaf pans but made the mistake the first time of taking them out to check on them after only 1 hour. Both cakes sunk in the middle. Still tasty but not pretty. The second time, I left them in or the full 1 hour 15 minutes without disturbing them and had only a slight amount of sinking after they were out. All in all, this is a fabulous cake.
