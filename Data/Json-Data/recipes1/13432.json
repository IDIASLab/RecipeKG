I used at least 2 tablespoons of chile sauce, which I added just after the noodles.  I may cut back on the amount of noodles next time because after a day or two they absorbed all the juice.  I'll continue making this recipe from time to time. **UPDATE**  It's been a couple of years since I made this soup and now I've tried it again and made additional discoveries.  First, if you're using spicy garlic sauce, two teaspoons will suffice and add 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.  If you're using sweet garlic sauce, use 1 tablespoon and add a dash or two cayenne pepper.  Secondly, to avoid loosing all the broth to the noodles, cook the noodles separately, then add them to the soup after the cabbage is just about tender, plus an additional cup of broth and 1 cup of water.  Trust me; you'll love it!",

So I added a small stalk of lemon grass that I whacked with my rubber mallet to crush it a bit, and a few kaffir lime leaves to the broth while it simmered.  I also added a teaspoon full of something called \"Hot Spice Powder\" which I picked up at our local international market.  The ingredient list is: white pepper, salt, spice; so I'm not really sure what all is in it, but it tasted good in the soup.  I used about a cup of teeny, tiny, skinny Fideo noodles.  The result was delicious.  DH put too much chile sauce in his serving, and complained about the heat, but that was his own silly fault.  We both really liked this.  Will definitely make it again. Oh, and I removed the lemon grass and lime leaves before serving. Thanks for the recipe!",

Buy \"no yolk\" egg noodles and enjoy!",

Thai sweet chilli sauce complemented the dish perfectly.  There was just enough flavour from the stock, leeks and from poaching the chicken in the soup base.\n\nI poached the chicken in 4 cups of chicken stock and then added another 3 cups of vegetable stock gradually when the fluid level ran low during the cooking of the vegetables and noodles.\n\nThanks for posting this recipe, Jessica.  Definitely a dish I will make regularly.",
