I had to add two cups of rice milk to the recipe to get it out of the 'brick stage'...and I didn't even add all the ingredients...I wonder if one can of beans can absorb four cups of oatmeal that has been ground up???? Something is dreadfully wrong with this recipe. Would like her to fix it and get back to me because it has possibilities!! thanks. PS: I think the problem with it was the instructions of 'dropping by the spoonfuls' onto the baking sheet. There's no way you can 'drop' this batter..it's like cement. Should have read:\"roll up into a log and cut in half inch widths\"!!!! george maloof",

I altered the recipe after reading other reviews. 1. ground up the oats with the coconut (I like coconut flavor but not texture!) 2. added 3 teaspoons of ground flax seed 3. added 1 cup apple sauce for moisture and 4. used prunes instead of dates and dried cranberries and blueberries instead of raisins. These are amazing! I will make them again with mini chocolate chips as a treat.",

We liked the first attempt well enough to make again with tweaking - have made 4 times now & here are my final tweaks: 2 tsp vanilla 2 tsp cinnamon 3/4 C raisins & 3/4 C applesauce. Without doubling the vanilla & cinnamon cookies were just sweet with no flavor. The applesauce adds enough liquid to make the dough workable - 3/4 C raisins is just because we like raisins - I imagine many other dried fruits could probably be substituted. It's important to not mix the dough one second more than necessary as over mixing results in a tough spongy cookie. I scoop the cookies out with a tablespoon & flatten them a bit once they're on a parchment lined cookie sheet. I usually get about 45 cookies & in my oven 15 minutes is the perfect time for baking. Great with coffee! These are not free food however. I did a rough estimate of calories carbs protein & fiber & the calorie/carb to protein/fiber ratio while better than an Oreo is not in a dieter's favor.",
