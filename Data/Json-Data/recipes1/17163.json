So easy to make and our 2-year old daughter loved it as well (she loves spicy food though) my husband loved it will definitely be adding to the regular rotation due to the simplicity of it it makes a great weeknight dinner...served it over jasmine rice.

I grilled mine as the recipe submitter mentioned and my steak stayed super tender. This recipe is so simple yet it blew my socks off! This would make an excellent marinade for venison wild duck or other wild game. This just may be the best recipe I've had this year so far! Thanks for sharing Aaron!",
