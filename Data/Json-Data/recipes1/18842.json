I think it made her day, having something hot cooking on the oven, and it smelled, well like \"home!\"  She enjoyed telling me stories while I chopped and cooked.  I did it on the stove also, I prefer to do all my cooking on the stove.  My only change was I chopped everything very very small.  It was great, I will definetly make this again!  I loved the difference the searing the meat did!!  Thanks!!",

I like to add a green veggie to this, green beans or peas work well for me (last 30 minutes).  BTW, use ONLY a high quality balsamic when cooking!  A nice variation would be to add a pint of red sauce, or a small can of tomato paste.  Love and good luck to all!",
