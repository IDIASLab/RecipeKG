It lacks a little depth compared to other \"old fashioned\" chocolate pudding recipes maybe because it has so few ingredients but it helps to add about a 1/4 tsp of salt some vanilla and a little cold butter after it's off the heat. Also some reviewers said they has trouble getting it to set. The recipe says to bring the cream and starch to a simmer over low heat; typically corn starch needs to simmer for about 60 seconds to thicken properly. If it's not thickening try simmering a little longer. You can tell when it thickens! It happens fast!",

Since no additional sugar is added I think semi-sweet is best in this recipe. I used Bailey's Irish Cream since I didn't have amaretto. I used regular half and half and cut it with 1% milk so it wouldn't be too rich. It came out thick and has a great texture but I had to add powdered sugar to sweeten this up. As is it's a good recipe just use the sweeter chocolate if you like it sweet because otherwise it won't be sweet at all.",
