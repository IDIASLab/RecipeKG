Cut out the butter completely (we didn't even miss it amazingly) used 6 cups of 2% milk, reduced fat sharp cheddar, reduced fat sour cream.  Reserved a 1/4 cup each of sour cream and cheese plus all of the bacon crumbles & used 1tbsp each to top each serving. DELICIOUS - never would have thought it healthy!  I also used about 6 potatos and coursley mashed them as opposed to cubed. YUM!",

At first taste, while it was still in the pot, I agreed. It tasted like soupy mashed potatoes. I added garlic and onion powder, parsley and cayenne pepper for some zip. When I initially viewed the recipe I felt that there was way too much butter/flour. I cut both back by half, not only to cut down on the fat, but because other reviewers stated that the soup was too thick. You definitely don't need all that roux to make this soup thick. If you do want it thicker, just add more potato, if you want it thinner, add more milk or chicken broth. This is the kind of recipe that you can put in whatever spices, herbs or meats that suit your own taste. You really can't ruin it. Overall, it was very good.",

I have done a bit of tweaking to suit my own tastes.... sub 2 cups chicken stock for 2 of the cups of milk, instead of green onions I add a finely chopped yellow onion and 2 cloves garlic that I've lightly browned in the bacon grease. I mash the potatoes a little bit with fork as well, cut the sour cream down a bit, save about half of the cheese and all of the crumbled bacon to top the soup with. It's even more flavorful and thick the next day.  If it gets too thick I just add a little milk when reheating.",

I tried this recipe exactly, but it was bland and had a thick flour taste.  My hubby said it reminded him of the paste from when he was in grade school.  If this sits for any length of time it becomes similiar to mashed potatos..  For all of you who said it was \"bland\" or \"milky\", try omitting 3 cups of milk and instead, cook half of your potatos in 3 cups of chicken broth.  Puree those, but bake the other half of the taters and cut them in small cubes.  Add you milk to the tater puree and heat to a simmer, you should not need the roux, potatos are a natural thickener.  I would recommend adding some salt, garlic powder and maybe even some chopped onion to the broth before you cook the potatoes, for added flavor.  Continue with the recipe ingreadiens and enjoy.",

I have added everything from the onion, sour cream and bacon they suggest to steak and chives.
