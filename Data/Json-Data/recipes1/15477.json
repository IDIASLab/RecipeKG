The only modifications I made were to add a little garlic salt and pepper. I typically like to prepare more homemade dishes but I can't discount something as easy and flavorful as this on those nights when I'm just not in the mood to cook. This went over really well. I was surprised at how good it was when I took my first bite. One note: pasta/veggie blends typically come with some sort of sauce. If you choose to cook your own noodles and use a regular blend of vegetables keep in mind that you will be missing the sauce and added flavor that comes with the pasta/veggie blend. Maybe try to compensate for that by adding extra spices.",
