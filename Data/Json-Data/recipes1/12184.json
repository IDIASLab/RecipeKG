As a result the molasses flavor wasn't overwhelmeing as one reviewer noted but I was hoping for a little more flavor from it so next time I will try using a 1/4 c of each. I also used powdered garlic and ginger because I was feeling lazy and I agree with the other reviewer who said fresh ginger and garlic are the way to go -- better flavor. I give it 4 stars because I think it has potential so I'll try it again with some tweaks.",
