I thought the lasagna was a bit difficult to roll, or rather, to fold.  Maybe manicotti would have been easier.  Also, 16 oz. ended up being way too much for the amount of filling I had.  Eight ounces would have been plenty.  But, nonetheless, a very tasty dinner.",

The vegetables I used were carrots (came cut into skinny pieces in a bag), frozen peas, a red pepper, and broccoli. I added two extra garlic cloves and some dried basil, oregano, and pepper because of earlier reviews. I also bought large shells instead of the lasagna noodles, which turned out to be easy to stuff. As soon as my friends came in the door, they commented on the wonderful smell. The compliments kept coming all night. One friend (who likes mushrooms) said he might add mushrooms next time to make the taste of the other vegetables milder. I, on the other hand, thought the meal was perfect. My husband commented that the meal was not heavy like some pasta dishes can be. I plan to use it many more times to come.",
