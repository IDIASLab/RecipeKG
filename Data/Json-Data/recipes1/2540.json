For sugar I used 1/2 cup agave nectar and the 2 TBSP molasses (not terribly sweet but the frosting adds to the sweetness). I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup. The sauerkraut I rinsed drained and squeezed out as much water as I could. Also I used 3 apples (they were small). Thanks for this crazy recipe - it's a great way to use up leftover sauerkraut. =) I only put 4 stars since I tweaked the original recipe so much but with my tweaks it's a 5 star recipe for our family.",

The cake baked well but took an extra 15 minutes to cook completely. The texture was excellent and my family enjoyed it. I wouldn't say it's their all-time favorite as you can taste the sauerkraut distinctly. They are pretty open-minded about food but if yours is picky this might not be good. I think it might work better with less sauerkraut and a bit more apple.",
