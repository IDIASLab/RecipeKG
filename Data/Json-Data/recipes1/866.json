Didn't have any nuts so just left those out (would have been good with them though...).  I cheated when it came to cooking, it was for breakfast and we were all starving so I put this in the microwave for 6min 30sec in the tupperware stack cooker base w/cone.  I did pour some olive oil onto a paper towel and wipe it down so it wouldn't stick (never believe non-stick promises!  LOL).  Came out great!  Held together nicely, no crumbling at all, and moist.  I served this with a little bit of cinnamon role icing drizzled on top and with slices of fresh kiwi.  (And each kid got a scrambled egg, can't have them filling up on cake now can we?)  Next time if I am braver I would layer the kiwi slices in the baking dish on the bottom and the middle to see how well that comes out.  They complimented each other so well!",
