Adding blue cheese turns this ordinary side dish into something really special. If you love blue cheese or grits half as much as I do, you'll love this recipe! Please follow the liquid and cooking time indicated on your package, using half chicken stock, half milk proportionally as your liquid. Quick, Instant and Regular grits can all be used by adjusting the cooking time.",
