Firstly had to lower the oven temp as the outsides were burning to 350 (though my oven isn't known for its consistancy). Also added another tblsp of butter (which I used instead of shortening) and a quarter cup MORE milk as it was looking very dry. The dough wasn't at all sweet (I am not trying to make a cracker!) so I added another 1/4c of sugar as well. Not a fan of chocolates etc in cookies so I mixed cinnamon and sugar and rolled the cookie balls in it before putting them in oven. Now almost as good as white flour cookies!",
