For the cucumber I did 3 mini ones. The skins are not tough and the seeds are small so I didn't need to remove either. If I was using English cucumbers I would have done the same. I decided since I was buying a bunch of ingredients that I might as well go with a better brand bottle of dressing. I chose one called Girards Italian dressing. It had a real light and not a tart flavor of most Italian bottled dressings. I thought there wasn't much tomatoes or olives in the salad so I added a little more to my bowl along with a tad extra dressing. I will make this again but more likely for a party. Thank you.",

I added black olives and changed the mozzarella cheese for 1/4 lb. each of colby and monterey jack cheeses. This is close to my Pasta Insalata recipe but without the pasta. It's great for those who cannot have starches. My friend loved it and I've already given her the recipe. This recipe allows for a lot of variations for the meat and cheeses. I used smoked ham but I plan on trying it with black forest later. I recommend adding more olives and tomatoes to help balance the food out. Compared to the cheese meat and cucumber there are not a lot of tomatoes and olives. Please give this a try even with the few reviews.",
