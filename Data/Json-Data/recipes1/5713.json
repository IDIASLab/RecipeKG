I sauteed the carrots and onions in olive oil first, because I have trouble digesting raw onions. I skipped pressing the tofu, just cubed it ahead of time and let it dry out on the counter for about a half hour, then used a potato masher to crumble it. I also skipped the seeds.  The next time I made it I used just the tofu, miso, and tahini and made it smooth in the food processor to use as a dip for raw veggies.  I added some onion powder and nutritional yeast and balsamic vinegar to replace the vegetables, and it was very tasty change of pace from hummus.",

I agree with the other posters that it is definitely better on the second day but I will still gobble it up on the first day. Variations: I have added celery (YUM!) and red cabbage to this. I think celery should be in the recipe. It is definitely an added texture. This recipe works great on toasted whole wheat especially with veganaise (vegan substitute for mayo I am sure regular mayo would be good too). I haven't tried it yet but I can't wait to add tomatoes avocados etc to the sandwich.",
