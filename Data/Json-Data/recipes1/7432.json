When I told my husband what I was making he gave me more than one disgusted look. We both ended up loving this. Besides the turkey for chicken the only other change was the amount of phyllo dough. I only had enough to put about 4 to 5 layers on top and bottom but again I thought it was great. Will definitely make again.",
