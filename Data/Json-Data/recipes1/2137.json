Turns out perfect. Make in a big pot not a saucepan. I used teflon and also teflon pan to bake in. Slid right out. Will be even better after it ages a day or two.",

I misread the directions (oops) and used candied fruit rather than dried fruit so the cake is probably a bit sweeter than it should be; next time I will use the candied fruit (it's so pretty in the cake) but cut the sugar by about 1/3. I also soaked the candied fruit in rum for a week which gave it a nice rich flavor. There was way more batter than for one loaf pan so I also made three small cakes in ramekins and wanted to try infusing them with rum for two weeks but my husband ate them on the second day!

This recipe is easy to follow and it really only takes 20 minutes to whip up everything before heading to the oven. The finished product is moist and dense in flavour probably due to the fact that I pre-soaked my fruits and nuts in rum for about a year. It aged better that way and the flavour comes out concentrated. This will be my family fruitcake recipe I will use year in and out! Thanks Mark! BonnieVic-Malaysia",
