Although this recipe didn t have peanut butter in it it was packed with salted peanuts that give this cookie a wonderful taste. I used my small cookie scoop and it yielded 87 cookies. This was more than enough to share with my family the neighbors in-laws and a good share to take on a road trip to Tennessee which was the intended purpose of making these cookies. The directions tell you to flatten with the bottom of a glass make sure that you do so. I forgot to do so on 1 pan and the cookie does not flatten much on its own. I flattened with a fork and chose to sprinkle the sugar over each cookie rather than dipping a glass in sugar each time. We all enjoyed this recipe and it will be made again.",
