A little less powdered sugar in this recipe than most makes all the difference.  I didn't add the pecans, and chose to sprinkle the coconut on top, but with or without those additions, this is one of the best buttercream frostings around. However, I always use hi-ratio shortening in any frosting recipe calling for shortening and it, too, makes all the difference.  One recipe generously frosted 12 cupcakes.",

Instead of shortening I used 3/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of coconut oil (virgin, cold pressed). It gave the icing a subtle coconut flavour and lovely smoothness. I also didn't add any coconut into the frosting itself, just toasted on the outside. Thank you for the amazing recipe, I will definitely be making this again :)",
