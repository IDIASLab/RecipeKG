If I were to make it again I would probaly try smoked ham to counter the sweet flavor of the cornbread stuffing or try a stuffing for ham or pork or an herb stuffing just to give it more flavor. I did use a mixture of swiss chedder and mozzarella cheese on top which I liked. I think I would use a little less ham next time maybe 3 cups. I also took the advice of the previous review and used 8 eggs.",

I used leftover cornbread and only added about a Tblsp of chicken broth as the cornbread was already moist. Used TurkeyHam and laid some slices of swiss cheese across the top. I also scrambled the eggs and poured them over the whole thing; it turned out \"quiche-like \" with cornbread chunks. I thought it turned out yummy my husband thought it would taste better with the original stuffing ingredients as the cornbread made it taste too sweet. I gave it 4 stars and I'll probably make this again for just me or for a potluck but not for a family meal.",
