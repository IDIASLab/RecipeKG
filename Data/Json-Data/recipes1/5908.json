That morning it only took a few minutes to assemble the ingredients and cook the spaghetti. I had more compliments on this dish than on anything else I've ever served.

I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup and 3/4 of the actual needed sour cream.  I only cooked it on high for 1 1/2 hours cause it did start to burn, but it gives it a nice little crunch.  I will make this again and probably cook it on low and stir it occasionally to keep it from burning on the sides.  I will also add more spinach cause I really like spinach.  Thanks for the recipe- I LOVED it!!",
