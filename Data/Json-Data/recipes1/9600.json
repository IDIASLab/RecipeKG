I marinated my roast for almost 48 hours then grilled it in a grill pan for 45 minutes and it wasn't even close to being reddish/pink in the middle still raw. So I put it in the oven for 1 hour and 20 minutes and then it turned out perfect! Although it was after 9:00 pm when it was finally done we wrapped it up and will be eating it again tonight. The marinade was great it would be fabulous too on a different cut of meat(perhaps london broil or steaks) that are usually prepared on a grill. I will stick with perhaps marinading actual roasts and baking them in the oven.",
