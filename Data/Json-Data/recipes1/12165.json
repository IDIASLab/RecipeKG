This was one of the best and most delicious recipes I have ever gotten from Allrecipes.com!  I did, however, make the following changes:\n1) In place of the cool whip, I used a pint sized container of heavy cream, whipped, and flavored w/ vanilla extract.  I added approx 1 1/2 cups of the whipped cream to the custard mixture, and \"frosted\" the top of the trifle with the rest.\n2) Instead of the blackberries, I used a 16 oz carton of frozen sliced sweetened strawberries in syrup.  I thawed it in the  microwave and spooned the syrup on the cake layers to moisten instead of the praline liqueur.\n3) I made multiple layers of cake, berries and custard, instead of just one layer of cake on the bottom.\n4) I used a 13 oz Entemann's All Butter Loaf Cake and it worked perfectly. \nThis was SO delicious I can't even believe it!  I definitely plan on making it for family and friends in the summer, when fresh berries are in season.  Thanks for an AMAZING recipe!",

Some substitutions (or additions) I made were: cut the lb cake lengthwise in thirds, spread apricot jam on each layer, put back together, then cut into cubes. I then layered the ingredients using a different berry for each layer (fresh berries only - blackberry, raspberry, blueberry,& strawberry)- cake, berry, pudding, etc. I couldn't find any praline liqueur so I lightly drizzled caramel over the cake before adding each layer. I garnished with a big dollup of whip cream and a fanned out strawberry and then placed fresh blueberries around the edge of the bowl...it just looked so yummy and pretty!!",
