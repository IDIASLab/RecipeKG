Instead of a 16 oz. container of chocolate milk mix, I bought a bigger container and ended up using three full cups.  Then I also added 1/4 cup of cocoa for a richer taste and a darker color.  Lastly, I used 1/2 cup of regular creamer, and 1/2 cup of French Vanilla flavored creamer.  The end result was great, and I made 48 decorated mason mugs full of this mix for our school's Santa's Workshop.  In the instructions, I also added a variation: \"for a delicious mocha flavor, add 1/2 tsp. of instant coffee\".  My 10 year old son LOVED making these with me!  Very easy for kids and not much mess.",

It made one of those 1 1/2 gallon ziploc bags full.  I am giving as Christmas gifts and have already recieved many compliments.  I bought the clear gift (treat) bags from the dollar store and put the mix in there and tied with pretty ribbon.  Stuck the mix in pretty mugs with a tag and voila!  Instant gift.  You might want to put on the tag \"mix with either hot water or for a cremier hot chocolate use hot milk).  BTW, it is much prettier if you will add a few mini marshmallows on the top of the mix-the color contrast of the white marshmallows looks great in the bags.  Thanks Fran!  I'm making the 3rd batch tonight.",

I tried a small batch of this as suggested in the recipe and it turned out to be milky hot water with a hint of chocolate in it. I then followed others advice and it turned out wonderfully but let's give credit where it's due to the reviewer who suggested upping it to 3 cups chocolate mix adding 1/4 cup cocoa and half the cream be french vanilla flavor. When I made it that way it turned from a flavorless mystery drink into a nice gift for my family.",

Milk or creamer with an off flavor will adversely affect the mix. I often add more cocoa powder or an excellent quality baking chocolate powder to boost the chocolate flavor. Sometimes I use a little less creamer to reduce the fat content. You can also successfully reduce the sugar content by using Splenda for part of the sugar.",

The recipe calls for a 16 ounce container, a 16 ounce container is a little more then 3 1/2 cups of powder.  I think people are seeing that 16 ounce and automatically thinking that is 2 cups.  There are 16 ounces in two cups of liquid, it doesn't work the same with a powder.  I have made this exact recipe for over 35 years and have never once had any complaints or anyone tell me they tweaked it any.  Thank you Fran for posting it!!!!",
