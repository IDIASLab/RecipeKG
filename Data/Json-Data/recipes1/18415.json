I did not use the marmalade in the sauce (we like our sauce a little more spicy than sweet). Instead I put in two Tbsp. spicy barbecue sauce and I also added some fresh garlic into the sauce. It turned out great. I didn't have minute rice so I just cooked some regular brown rice and used 2 cups of cooked rice. That's probably less than 2 cups of uncooked minute rice but the meatballs turned out moist and firm--not crumbly at all!",
