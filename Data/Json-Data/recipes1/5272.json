I fried them in a frying pan, in about 1 1/2 inches of oil, so had to flip them over once they got brown on one side.",

Now that I think about it I could have used something like Krusteaz or Bisquick but I really enjoyed the cornbreadish taste/feel so I would still use the cornmeal. I also added a little bit of Turbinado (natural grain)sugar maybe a T. I've never fried before this was my first go and it was GREAT! I'd say the secret is to actually wait the 10 minutes they suggest before that it was way too runny. It thickened up perfect though. This recipe made 29 \"pups\". (Boy they went fast!) GOOD LUCK!",
