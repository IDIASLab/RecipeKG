I doubled the recipe (used Club crackers)and put it in a 9x13 pan which worked perfectly for the base. I used 2 qt. strawberries and 12 oz. Cool Whip. To the Cool Whip I added 2/3 bag of Heath Bit-O-Brickle (toffee pieces) which made it even more fabulous! I sprinkled the rest of the toffee on top of the strawberries at the end. It added another touch of sweetness and a great crunch. Thanks for the SUPER recipe - never would have thought to put those ingredients together myself!",

I used pure almond extract in place of vanilla and NEVER use cool whip...fresh whipped cream is so easy to make and takes only a few extra minutes and tastes far superior to the oil & chemicals also known as cool whip. I like to add a little almond extract to the whipping cream too! Thanks Tammy for sharing this recipie! YUM!:-)",
