I'm a crazy Irish pastry chef so of course I didn't do them as the recipe \"dictated\" per se....so I have a wheat allergy, so spelt flour instead, I used 1/2 cup BUTTER, I made up a basic royal icing of 1 c icing sugar, 1 egg white and some vanilla and threw it all over the cookies like in the pic because it looks just so nice and just to make things even more different, I rolled half of mine in sugar, ran off, grabbed a bag of ground almonds, rolled most of the remainder in that and then just for fun I rolled 3 in coconut.  So far I've only tasted the almond ones and they are MOST excellent.  The rest are in the oven, I'll let you know how they taste when the time comes.  Thanks:D",

If you make them the size the recipe says (teaspoonful), you will get 83 cookies - I did.  And they are the typical gingersnap size.  I did not have any issues with the dough holding together.  Perhaps those cooks who did used too small of an egg, or  are not experienced with cookie making?  I did press mine down a bit with a glass, like most gingersnap recipes say to; I figured this recipe accidentally left that part out.  I baked mine on stones, so they needed more like 7-8 minutes instead of 5-6.\nWatch out, they are quite addictive!:-)  ",
