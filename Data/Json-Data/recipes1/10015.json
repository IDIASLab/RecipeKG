So I ended up using 64 crackers (4X the number needed), which of course resulted in there not being enough butter to moisten them.  After I realized this, I removed 1/2 the crackers and added another 1/4 cup of butter, and it turned out fine even though the proportions were off!  Make sure you know that 1 cracker is 1/4 of a \"sheet\" as it comes in the package!",

Sorry, but some of these reviews are just dead wrong in terms of what is meant by \"16 crackers.\"  The only way to fill up the pie plate (I used a 9 inch) substantially enough to get a sturdy crust is to use 16 WHOLE graham crackers: that's 16 of the large rectangles.  Otherwise your crust will be flimsy & very difficult to spread evenly.  However, in using 16 whole crackers you have to increase the butter to a 1/2 CUP.   With those indications it's a great crust.  I made it with Key Lime Pie VII so the no-sugar-needed aspect of this crust was a perfect compliment.  I did not pre-bake (only baked the time necessary for the pie) and I greased the pie plate w/ the butter wrapper.  The pie slices slipped right out.",

A little Pam spray and it's so much easier. Thanks Sara!!",
