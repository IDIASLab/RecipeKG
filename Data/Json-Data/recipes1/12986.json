                "reviewBody": "In order to get authentic tasting chile rellenos, you should use a couple of eggs, seperated.  Whip the whites w/an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.  Beat the yolks seperatley and fold them into the whites (preseverving the volume of the whites).  Then you can dip the stuffed chiles into the egg...and don't worry about slopping it on.  You want the entire chile covered.  When your chile comes out of the oil, you'll have a nice fluffy coating...rather than a heavy egg-y tasting batter that most homemade recipes call for.\r\n\r\nAn easy way to char your chiles is to heat up the broiler in your oven and toss the peppers directly on to the racks.  (Poblano's can be substituted w/great results). You want the entire surface to be browned and blistered, so you will have to flip them occasionally.  Then, stick the peppers in a zip-lock and let them steam for about 1/2 an hour or so.  When you return to them, they'll be cool enough to handle, and the skin will be really easy to peel off!!  Make sure not to remove the stems when you slit open the chiles to remove the seeds and membranes.\r\nFollow these tips, and you will have one tasty little treat!!\r\nAlso, I use white cheese rather than cheddar (I use Oaxacan cheese...but for areas where Mexican cheese isn't available, Monterey Jack is a good substitute)",

I followed one of the suggestions below and also did some research on authentic chile rellenos.  I don't know the exact type of chile's I had, a friend gave me some from her garden.  To char them, I tossed them in an 8x8 pan and put the oven on broil and rotated them as they would brown and blister.  when all sides were done, I put them in a ziplock bag to steam.  I returned to them about 45 min. later and they were cool enough to handle and the skin came off so easily. After slitting and cleaning out the peppers, I stuffed them with the cheddar cheese strips. The only ingredient I used for the batter was some eggs and a bit of flour....I took 3 eggs, separated them, and beat the whites until they were stiff and formed peaks. Then I beat the yolks with 1 TBsp. flour until they were pasty. I folded this mixture into the egg whites and stirred gently.  Then I rolled the stuffed chiles in flour and slopped on the egg mixture.  The batter puffed up beautifully when fried and really makes the authentic chile rellenos. I topped mine with warmed mild salsa. Husband gobbled them up! I am glad to have another dish to add to my collection.  Thanks to Panchita and the reviewers below mine.",

For me Anaheim peppers are too mild and I'll go for the Poblano any day (and who said Poblanos were \"screaming hot\"? They're pretty mild...) So I used Poblanos of course. These were not too difficult to make (time intensive yes. Difficult? No) but the result was not worth the effort for me when I can easily go buy really good rellenos. I'm used to a softer batter - not the crispy fried-fish like texture of these. Done with good cheese though they are a reasonable substitute if you just can't get to decent Mexican food. While I enjoyed these they were not what I was expecting from a Relleno. They got three stars because they were still quite tasty and had I not been expecting a specific result I would have loved them. Definitely worth doing for fun and a taste of Mexico if you're just dying for it.",
