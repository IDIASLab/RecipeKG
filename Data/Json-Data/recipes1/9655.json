My husband and I came up with this recipe about two years ago playing around in the kitchen one day.  Ever since then it has been our family's favorite. Garnish each dish with red pepper or Parmesan cheese to your taste. Instead of making your own pesto you can use 1/2 bottle of pre-made pesto from the grocery store.",

I used 1/2 cup bottled pesto about 5 ounces sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil & spices used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne and used thin spaghetti in place of bow tie pasta. I also grilled up two thinly sliced chicken breasts cooked in a bit of the rich oil from the sun dried tomatoes jar. We had the chicken cut up on top of the pasta with pine nuts and parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. Gourmet meal and something I would definitely make again!",

Fresh Basil makes it MUCH better as does a 1/4 cup of parmesan mixed in and 1/4 cup of pine nuts for a more gourmet flavor. No need to mince the nuts at all, try enjoying their buttery bite. And please don't \"rinse\" your oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes as another reviewer suggested, simply drain whatever amount of tomatoes you want to use, and adjust the amount of extra olive oil to your taste.",

For the pesto in the food processor I mixed the following: 2 cups fresh basil 1 heaping tablespoon of minced garlic 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1/3 cup olive oil & 1/4 cup pine nuts. (I did not saut\u00e9 more garlic). Instead of dried tomatoes I used sundried tomatoes packed in oil and then left out the extra 1/8 cup oil. I also threw in about 1/4 cup of fat free half & half to simmer with the pesto/mushroom mix. Right before I tossed the mix with my fettuccine noodles I added a huge bunch of fresh spinach and let it wilt before mixing it all together. All in all it is a great recipe. I really think it would have been too dry with the original pesto ingredients but the flavor is amazing. I was shocked by the cayenne at first for some reason but after a couple of bites it grew on me as something deliciously different.",

I then added the fresh mushrooms cayenne pepper and 5 oz sundried tomatoes (The salt is not needed for this recipe). After all of that was cooked I drained the excess oil before adding the pesto.
