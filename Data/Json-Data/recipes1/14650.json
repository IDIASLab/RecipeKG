Even if you just dot the top of the flour with some small pieces of butter, it would brown up better.  There\u2019s really not enough water sprinkled over the top to moisten the flour, and what you end up with is a topping with splotches of white flour\u2026not very appealing to the eye.  I baked an extra 7 minutes and still didn\u2019t get that golden brown color.  I stopped there because I didn\u2019t want to risk drying out the delicious juice from the apples.  On the positive side, it really is extremely easy to make (particularly if you have an apple peeler and a wedger/slicer), and it does taste good.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

I used Fuji, since that's what I had on hand, and it's likely that this recipe is five stars with the tart apples. \n\nThe crust baked up beautifully, it was a wonderful texture the first night, if a little sparse. It wasn't overly tasty, which is what I think the tastier apples would have compensated for. By the next day, the crust was mushy, but the dessert was still enjoyed warm with a big scoop of ice cream on top.",
