It was light in texture but heavy in the stomach-so be careful about taking seconds! I used smooth peanut butter and forgot the vanilla- but I still rate it.

I told my friend about AR and she said she'd give them a 5 star so there ya go:) I thought these were really nice too but I did use: Butter instead of Marg 1/2 less flour & a lil less sugar (used 1/2 brown sugar instead of white). These were really really greasy (i guess from the PB??) that's one thing i didn't really like. And it seemed like they needed more of a peanut butter flavor to them. I will probably make these again though since they went over so well with my friends!!",
