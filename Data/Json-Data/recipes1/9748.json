Mine didn't spread out much so I wonder if substituting butter-flavored shortening would make them flat like regular chocolate chip cookies and not a clump like mine turned out). The taste was outstanding. When I made them for a staff meeting everyone had difficulty trying to stop eating them and one guy got a stomach ache from eating so many! I would say these are the ultimate chocolate chip cookie! Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!",

I tried one then reserved my review until Hubs was able to try one too and offer his review which I fully expected would be different than mine. It's an attractive enough cookie and I appreciate that they baked up to a nice thickness - not flat but not cakey poofs either. As I do with all cookie doughs made with butter I chilled the dough for about an hour till it was somewhat firm. But I thought these were too soft (but then I don't care for soft cookies) - if I was to make them again I'd use half white and half brown sugar to help with that. They also had just a tad too much \"stuff\" in them for me - \"stuff\" overload. My vote is three stars for being too soft with too much of the chips toffee and nuts. But I figured that exactly what I DIDN'T like about these cookies would be the very things Hubs did. Sure enough - as he was chewing he held up 5 fingers (rare). He said what he liked about them was that that they were gooey (my \"too much stuff\") and soft. Tastes and reviews are so subjective! Four star average between the two of us.",

Finally I did half a batch w/ pecans and half w/out (therefore only using 1/2c pecans). Even non-cookie lovers (like myself) had snatched a handful here and there. Thanks a bunch Barb.
