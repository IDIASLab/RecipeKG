And I would've pigged out on them with a glass of milk if I weren't dieting. So I'm giving 5 stars for the finished product. I have to say that the cookie dough was kind of gross -- way way too oily. I was wringing the oil out as I rolled them. I have a couple of cake mix cookbooks and many of the recipes require 1/3 c. oil 2 eggs the cake mix and whatever. Next time I may cut back on the oil a little bit and see if the cookies still turn out as good. Also I baked the cookies on parchment paper which may have helped in soaking up some of the excess oil during baking.",

I couldn't really tell if they had cooked enough because they were chocolate so I'll cut the cooking time a bit when I make these again. These seem like they would also be good with peanut butter chips. Thanks for the recipe!",
