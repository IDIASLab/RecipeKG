I followed the recipe exactly until it came to the roasting time - I steamed the carrots for 5 minutes - then I roasted all the veggies in a well preheated 500 degree oven for 20 min.  I cut the recipe to serve 4 people - a mistake - Ron and I ate it all in one sitting!  Fellow chefs you must try this one!!!  So different.  Thanks submitter.",

The baby carrots took about 30 mins to really soften by which time some of the grapes and onion had burned. Next time I'll add them after 15 mins so that they keep a little bit of bite.
