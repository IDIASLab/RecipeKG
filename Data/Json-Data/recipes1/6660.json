As if the cake isn't good enough on its own, the rich, buttery, sweet lemon glaze (which I gradually brushed on with a pastry brush) soaks in and transforms this into something celestial.  The kind of cake that when you taste that first bite you close your eyes and sigh, \"Mmmmm.\" (I'm not kidding) This cake is so good, so delicious, so perfect, that it almost defies description and it will probably sound trite when I try.  It is fluffy, moist, light, buttery, lemony and pretty as a picture. A simply lovely lemon cake.  I can't imagine making this cake any differently than how the recipe directs.  I can only imagine that any change would change its perfection.  Leave OUT the glaze? No!  Frost with butter cream?  Please don't! Don't fill it, don't frost it, don't add, take out or change anything.  This is one of the best cakes,  if made as the submitter directs, you'll ever eat.  (Oh... I forgot.  I did leave out the raisins.  That was a good thing.)",

Also, instead of the frosting, it's really good to combine about 3/4 cup each of fresh lemon juice and sugar to use as a glaze.  When the cake comes out of the oven, let it cool for about 15 minutes, then poke it all over with the slender skewer and pour the glaze over.  It will soak it up and it adds amazing flavor.  Highly recommended.",

First time I baked as directed in a square pan (did not make the glaze) and my family loved it.  Second time I made cupcakes and reduced baking time to 15 minutes.  When the cupcakes came out I spooned over a little glaze on each cupcake. I prefer this cake without the glaze which just adds a lot of calories and not much flavour.   When I made the cupcakes I subsituted 1 cp lemon flavoured yogurt for buttermilk and added fresh lemon juice in place of lemon extract.  I think these two subsitutions really enhanced the flavour of the cake. This is a really good and easy recipe.  The lemon flavour is not overpowering and the cake is moist and yummy.",
