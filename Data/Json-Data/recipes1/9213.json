But I'm always looking for new things to add and I was excited to try this since I love carrot cake and I love pineapple. I thought it would be moist and have a great flavor. I was really disappointed. This was the thickest cake batter I've ever made. I baked in 2-8\" round cake pans at 325 convection. I knew I'd have to adjust the time so I set my initial timer to 50 minutes. I checked the cake at 20 min and it had risen really beautifully so I was really looking happy with it. At 40 minutes the top of the cake was almost burnt the cake had fallen in the center and the insides were still very wet. It just didnt look good or appetizing. The range was here when we bought the house 2 years ago and we have found that the oven is actually about 25 degrees off. Setting at 325 in actuality is 300 for our oven etc.... I turned the temp down another 25 degrees to try to get the cake to quit getting dark and to give the insides a chance to finish baking. At 50 minutes the toothpick came out almost perfectly clean so I pulled it. After letting it cool a bit I tried to turn the cake out onto cooling racks to finish the process. Both cakes fell apart. The cake is really dense and heavy and the top bottom and sides are all very dry. I think the creator needs to hone this recipe a bit and give it another try. Somethings off here. Not a keeper for me.",
