My husband doesn t like eggplant so I used broccoli in its place. I baked the veggies for 15 minutes while I marinated the chicken then added the chicken and cooked it all together for another 20 minutes. Perfection! Yummy and moist chicken. I accidentally used only 1 tsp of dried rosemary (versus the 1 TBS it asks for) and I thought it was plenty. The only addition I made to the marinade was by adding a little bit of salt. Thanks for a great recipe!",

The vegetables get SO sweet when they are roasted like this! I reduced the amount of oil slightly as I don't think it really needs that much and I cut the chicken into chunks to absorb more of the marinade and also cook faster. And of course I tripled the garlic. To prevent cross-contamination from the chicken I tossed the veggies in a bag with some of the marinade spooned in and then poured the rest over the chicken. The recommendation to cook the veggies while the chicken was marinating worked out perfectly. Thank you!",
