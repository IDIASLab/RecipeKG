Thank-you Michele for submitting it.***Tip***\r\nIf you use a Kitchen aide, the mixing process is a piece of cake. LOL  Also using 8oz of cream cheese for the frosting gives it alittle more cheese cake like taste.  5 star recipe !!!!!!!!\r\n                   Midge",

I made an exception with this cake to use up some apples and I'm so so glad I did. For those worried about the time consuming nature of chopping dicing and slicing -- I suggest the use of a food processor. I chopped the apples in fairly large chunks and pulsed them in the food processor until they were small but not turned to mush. I did the same with the walnuts. This saved a huge amount of time and still gave the cake all of the \"chunkiness\" it needed. This cake is very similar in denseness and sweetness to a good carrot cake but even better in my opinion. Definitely take the time to try this!",
