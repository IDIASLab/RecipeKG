My friends and family insist that I make them every Christmas - they don't last long! The dough needs to be worked into balls quickly as it gets crumbly. I found that if you just stick it in the microwave for a few seconds at a time until it's warm again it comes back together so you can finish. A delicious crowd pleaser! Fun to get the kids involved with this one.",
