Never used butter with this dish before but it was certainly a treat Nora! I did as others add a lot more seasonings which made the chicken even better. Of course you can use whatever herbs or spices you like. I found this recipe from \"Taylor's\" reviews and I must say that it was so nice to read reviews from someone who is obviously a very sweet and caring person. As I was reading I felt the same as when a stranger passes you on the street and smiles at you for no reason! Taylor you made my day!
