I opted to use some leftover citrus grilled chicken I had on hand. I also used some red grapes for a little color. I didn't have cucumber salad dressing so I used Hellman's light mayo cut with a bit of sour cream and added a bit of salt pepper and just a bit of curry powder. Overall very good on toasted whole grain bread.",

The red grapes orange mandarin oranges green celery and brown nuts gave it a nice presentation.",
