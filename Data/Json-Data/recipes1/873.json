                "reviewBody": "This recipe was okay but could use a couple of tweaks, which is why I rated it three stars. I followed the instructions, but I halved the recipe because other reviewers stated it made a lot. There were WAYYYY too many cookie crumbs and it was sickeningly sweet ( and I'm not usually one to complain about sweetness). Anyways, I recommend using half the cookies. Also, try using chocolate pudding, as this is how \"real\" dirt cake should be made. Forget about the butter all together, you don't need it for taste at all. All it does is give the cream cheese a thinner consistency once its blended in. So to achieve that, just throw in 2 extra tablespoons of milk instead of the butter. You should also omit the powdered sugar unless you want your cake to be extremely sweet . The pudding and whipped topping are sweet enough by themselves. adding the plain cream cheese balances the taste of the pudding mixture and gives it the perfect sweetness. It's a bummer when you try a recipe with great ratings and end up disappointed with the results. I hope this review helps. (no offense to who-ever submitted the recipe, just giving my honest opinion :) ",

The other cookies don't give it the best flavor. For pool and beach theme parties i use the opposite. Vanilla cookies and chocolate pudding. To make it look like sand.

                "reviewBody": "loved it! I used an 8 inch plastic flower pot. Came out perfect. The pot has holes inside so I lined the inside with aluminum foil. The best way to do so is to turn the pot upside down place the foil on top and press it to take the shape of the bottom of the pot. Remove the foil and turn the pot right side up and place the pot shaped foil inside...Also I made my own whipped cream to not make it too sweet and still came out really sweet.Next time I will not add any sugar in the whipped cream. But really delicious everyone was surprised! Update 06/16/2008: It's been three yrs now that I make this cake for father's day. This time I used chocolate pudding and added no sugar to the cream that I whipped. My mom did not like the salty taste from the cheese and did not care for the sandy texture of the oreos inside so I used mascarpone cheese instead of cream cheese and soaked the oreo cookies for a couple seconds in milk and added them whole to make the layers. I only crumbled some for the top for the dirt effect. What an improvement! So creamy and delish! My mom loooved it yippy!! From now on I will only use mascarpone for this recipe! And kep the cookies whole(about 2 pkgs of cookies.)",
