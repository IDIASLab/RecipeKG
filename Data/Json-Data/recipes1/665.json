                "reviewBody": "I make these every Christmas and Halloween! I use a fairly big dollop of peanut butter right in the middle of the cracker and when I top it with the other cracker I smoosh them until the peanut butter is at the edges. I also use almond bark with a teaspoon of shortening.  It microwaves great and the shortening makes it smooth and easy to dip. Another tip: Make sure that you get off every bit of excess chocolate or they will be sitting in a little puddle by the time they cool and won't be as attractive. One more thing: These are so easy to decorate! I always use holiday sprinkles, applied right after I dip them while the chocolate is still shiny. Alternatively, I put a little chocolate of a contrasting color (white chocolate if I dipped the cookies in milk chocolate, or vice versa) into a baggie and melt it in the microwave. Then I snip off just the barest corner and squeeze it back and forth over the cookies to make a nice pattern. OR I buy candy food coloring and turn the white almond bark whatever color I like! Hope these tips help someone! ",

These always are the hit of any cookie tray and I always get asked for the recipe (and really, I've had people shocked when they find out really what's in it) so make sure you bring paper copies of the recipe and at least double the recipe when you make it. This bends to whatever kind of peanut butter you have, wether it's chunky or smooth, and whatever baking chips you have on hand. You don't have to have a double boiler, you can melt the chips in a microwave safe bowl 40 seconds at a time, stirring well at the end of every 40 seconds until it's the right consistancy. I recommend you use a name brand peanut butter if you can, only because with some cheaper peanut butters, they can get liquid-y and sometimes seperate and it's not pretty. This is also good with peanut butter/marshmallow fluff or peanut butter/Nutella. It really is super bendable and really fun to play with. Even adding a teaspoon of extract, like peppermint, to the melted chocolate is a whole other way to make it different. NOTE: You should guesstimate that it's one bag of chips per sleeve of crackers. That's how it usually works out for me.",
