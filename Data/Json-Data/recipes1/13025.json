Also I added some chopped celery and the last of my freshly sliced mushrooms. Added a little shredded cheddar cheese used garlic & herb seasoned croutons and served over hot rice. Honestly - slop is right: it looks less than appealing BUT taste isn't too bad (not amazing but not bad either) and I esspecially appreciate the little amt of time it takes to prepare and cook - PERFECT for those hectic nights when cooking is THE LAST thing you want to do. Will keep this in mind for those nights when I would rather poke my eyes out than cook.",

Also I eighthed two russet potatoes and sliced a red pepper into strips adding them before the soup. The potatoes reduce the salty flavor and the red peppers added some color.
