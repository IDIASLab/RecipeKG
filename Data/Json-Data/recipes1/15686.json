It was tasty, but the caramel hardned once I placed it in the fridge and when I tried to cut it, the topping messed up.  I suggest a LIQUID CARAMEL TOPPING that is normally for ice cream. That way it is soft.  But keep the caramel candy in the cheesecake part, it was delicious.   ",

I made this recipe almost as exactly stated. The only change I made was the caramel I used. I did not use Kraft caramels, I used Praline Sundae Topping (with the nuts omitted - recipe from this site) for the entire recipe. The amount to be used in the batter (36 melted caramels) would be 1\u00bc cups. (special thanks to redneck gramma for calling Kraft to find out!) This cheesecake baked up perfectly and I did not top it with the nuts and caramel right away because sometimes I like plain cheesecake. When enjoyed plain, you can tell that it is a caramel cheesecake. The flavour is subtle yet noticeable and perfect on it's own. I added caramel and pecans to individual servings and wow, just looking at it was like eye candy - digging into it was heavenly! Thanks for the recipe. Delightful!",
