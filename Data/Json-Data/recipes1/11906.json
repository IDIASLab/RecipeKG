I reduced the mustard to 3/4 cup, and used the pepper in moderation.  (We have little kids)--hence, not so spicy.  Still, it was fabulous!  Thanks for such a great recipe!",

We had sandwiches the next day and my Carolina-raised husband said it was the best barbeque sandwich he'd ever eaten. I steamed the buns and topped the BBQ with a little extra hot sauce and regular slaw (as opposed to BBQ slaw) Yummy - better than 5 stars!",
