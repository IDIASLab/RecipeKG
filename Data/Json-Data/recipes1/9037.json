Rather than refined sugar I used Turbinado (that's all I use) and rather than vanilla I used honey (it's all I had!). I chopped up a batch of apples given to me by my neighbors so I have no idea which type they were using a baby food maker. This works great b/c you can basically do it in one-cup increments and adjust to your taste. I did have to cook it a bit longer than the recipe calls for (using all 5 1/2 cups of apple I cooked in a 9x9 for 55 minutes @ 325)but it turned out great. It's dense and very moist like a wet sponge. But the flavor's great and the kids loved it!",
