I did NOT make the full batch but the following changes (Full batch) are a MUST if you want this recipe to work. Decrease the eggs by half no more than 8 eggs. Increase the baking soda to a total of 8 teaspoons (2 Tbsp 2 tsp) Increase peanut butter to a total of 3 cups. Decrease the oats by 1/3 -use only 12 cups. It may look slightly \"crumbly\" in the mixing bowl but they turn out PERFECTLY! The following is a suggestion - leave the corn syrup out it's not needed. I found 10 minutes baking time was perfect. I'm hesitant on rating this recipe only b/c it's NOT a 5 star recipe as written. It becomes a good cookie IF the ingredient quantites are correct so I'm giving it 4 stars b/c I had to re-work the quantities.",
