I think it cut a little down on the sweetness. Overall it's a tasty bread; I think it'd be even better if I'd used the sauce. Also the walnuts don't stay on the top very well when you try and cut the bread so I'd suggest either punshing them down before baking or simply mixing them in the batter.",
