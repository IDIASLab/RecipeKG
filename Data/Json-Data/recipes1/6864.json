I also added a package of frozen chopped broccoli for some extra veggies and some chopped green pepper. Next time I think I'll add red pepper to add color. Using frozen chopped cooked chicken frozen broccoli and prechopped onion and pepper made putting this together a breeze! Its even better the next day too! will definitely make this again.",
