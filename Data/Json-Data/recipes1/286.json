The only suggestion I have is that the directions for using your hands to \"mix thoroughly\" may not be specific enough for some people who don't know that meand that the dough needs to be kneaded for quite several minutes at minimum.  I think some of the negatTive reviews probably came about because they didn't mix it well enough.\n\nThis is a purist's type of shortbread, if that's what you're looking for.\n\nI just wanted to add that you should sift the flour first.  Otherwise you get a more flour than you need, resulting in a dryer dough, which can lead to a \"flour-y\" taste, even with kneading.  If you don't sift the flour first, then you definitely need to add less flour, maybe 1/4-1/3 cup less.",
