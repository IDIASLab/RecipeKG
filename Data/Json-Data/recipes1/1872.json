By happy accident I'd substituted 1/2 cup of wheat flour since I'd run out of all purpose -- what a difference. I used a microbrew and folded in dried cranberries for more flavor (per another suggestion posted). This is a savory cookie if the recipe is followed not sweet. However I've done a variation where I used the \"sweeter\" Guinness stout and folded in chocolate chips. I think using the basic recipe with 1 1/2 cups all purpose and 1/2 cup wheat flour along with a beer and a folded confection or dried fruit could make this fun (pick a beer like Cherry wheat and fold in dried cherries maybe etc). Also for beer drinkers this cookie is not too sweet (depending on what you add) and is a change from chips pretzels etc. Doesn't look like the basic all purpose flour walnuts (and I'm guessing people pickd the macrobrew pilsner lagers as the beer) is all that great.",

They were awesome although more the consistency of muffins. My brother's girlfriend remembered the alterations and made beer muffins later and reported that they turned out better than the cookies. A suggestion for the beer to use: we used a Sam Adam's seasonal cranberry lambic ale. I'd also suggest a cherry wheat or other types of wheat beers to give these cookie-muffins a more hearty flavor.",

I used 1 cup of Newcastle and I added some raisins and a bit of oats to bulk them up a little. I also added an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a little vanilla but I guess it wasn't enough to make a difference. These were really easy to make and I like that they didn't have eggs white sugar or an outrageous amount of butter. They are sooooo good hot out of the oven!! I love the texture its very soft and kind of spongy! I can tell the flavor will be a little bland when they cool though. Next time I will add some chocolate chips (I think white choc would be great in these) or more raisins and maybe some chopped walnuts or macadamias. Yum!",
