It is very easy and quick but it quickly solidifies as it cools so I think it might be better served in a crockpot or fondue pot. I thought about using my crockpot but I only had a 1/4 of the Velveeta called for so I didn't have enough to put in the crockpot. It has a good flavor but I probably should have put in a little more beer. I was thinking it would be too runny but it really does thicken up quickly so probably the more beer the better. Thanks for the recipe.",
