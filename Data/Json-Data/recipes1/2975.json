I don't measure the bread crumbs but dry 1 loaf of bread, cube it and then double the broth and poultry seasoning. I also use less than a cup of onion and celery.  One cup of each is a little too much for us. This year we added portabella mushrooms and it was wonderful.  I didn't put the apple in but may have to try it the next time. This is a very good recipe and there are never any leftovers. Thanks for sharing your recipe Christine!",

Substitute for cubed bread, I used a bag from the grocery store, which turned out find.  Also, 12 cups is too much, 10 cups of cubed bread worked very well.  2)  USE AT LEAST 3 CUPS CHICKEN BROTH/STOCK.  This made it moist and delicious!!! 3)  ADD ONE CLOVE GARLIC to the onion/celery saute.  And finally, 4) USE A VARIETY OF MUSHROOMS, this will add to the depth of flavor of the stuffing.  I used a gourmet mix and 'baby bellos'.  I did a 'rehearsal' of this recipe tonight and it came out absolutely delicious with the changes I listed above.  If you have any mushroom lovers in your house, this will surely be a winner!",
