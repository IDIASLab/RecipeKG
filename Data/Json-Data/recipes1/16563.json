So simple and so delicious - what more could you ask for from such an easy recipe? I made sure that the cream cheese and egg were at room temp. just as you do with cheesecakes and added a cup of mini chocolate chips to make this even more decadent. This definitely takes regular brownies to another level of deliciousness with only a few ingredients.  Have a cold glass of milk on hand 'cause you're gonna need it!",
