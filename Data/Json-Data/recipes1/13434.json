I made mine gluten -free by using the new Gluten-free Bisquick Mix.I  finished mine  off with slivered almonds before baking.  I like a little crunch. Delish!",

I DICED the mix of yellow squash and zucchini and had to use the sour cream variation suggested by someone else. I had NO RUNNY-NESS but maybe because I diced the squash or cooked a few minutes longer. I also added ground cooked chicken to the mixture. I found I needed salt but would not add it until eating and I think next time the addition of a 1/2 cup of SHARP cheddar would make this dish PURE HEAVEN!! Can ya tell I liked it???",

I used sour cream instead of buttermilk and one egg and minced my onions instead of grating (personal preference).

Cooked it exactly one hour in a glass pie pan and it came out great not mushy. Will definitely make again.",
