In order to decrease the fat I used water chestnust instead of the cashews, and half bacon/half Morningstar Farm veggie bacon...no one at the table suspected a thing! Then, when I opened my new container of sour cream...it was spoiled and I had to substitute. I used what sour cream I had left in the fridge with equal parts nonfat plain yogurt and ranch dressing, mixed in a little sugar to take the edge off the yogurt. I would do the same next time, healthier too!",

Then I added in some ranch dressing and mixed it together to cut the heavy sour cream taste and make the texture a little lighter and smoother. Luckily I did not add the cashews to the salad bowl leaving them on the side for people to add as they wish so I didn't have to deal with soggy cashews.
