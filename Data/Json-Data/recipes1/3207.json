This pumpkin pie is absolutely delicious.  You wouldn't know it wasn't baked judging by it's taste and consistency; in fact this was superior.  And I've baked a lot of pumpkin pies! I won't bake a pumpkin pie again, as this pie was creamier, filled the pie crust better, and in fact was easier to prepare.  I usually add more spices than recipes call for, but this recipe was just right, nice and spicy. Thank you Cathy.",

This was the first pie I've ever made and no bake it's so great! I made this for Thanksgiving the other day and it was truly an absolute HIT! The only odd thing that occurred while heating the filling part/egg spice and milk mixture was that for some reason the eggs seemed to almost scramble.. into little bits. But it was primarily because the heat was set on medium--you should really stir the eggs in slowly while the mixture begins to heat on low and then add the spices and pumpkin last with the heat off stirring after about 15-20 minutes constantly on low. This is only for pure perfection. I just love this pie and I would definitely make it again and again for anything! Not too sweet but not to pumpkinny it's just right! The crust is amazing if you use a graham cracker one. Delish!",
