However I made many alterations to the dish due to time contraints. First I heated the olive oil and browned some garlic and minced onion. I then added 1 cup chicken and half green and half red bell pepper chopped. When the cubed chicken was cooked through I added 1 8oz container of cream cheese with chives and 1 can Italian stewed tomatoes. This addition not only thinned the sauce as others have stated but also it allowed me to eliminate the basil parsley and other spices. Served over the penne pasta and viola!! Dinner was a hit (to my surprise). Sprinkled some dry parsley and parmesean cheese over all for presentation. Great recipe Toni (even altered) and will make again!!",

I served it with grilled chicken soaked in a red wine marinade. I am not a very good cook but this was delicious. My fiance loved it! What impresses me is being able to make a fantastic meal in under 5.00 Thanks Toni-great job",
