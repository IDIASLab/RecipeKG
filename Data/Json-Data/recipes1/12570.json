I used milk with the soup rather than water, I also used cream of mushroom.  I added pepper and garlic powder when I was layering the cabbage and potatoes.  I also sprinkled salt, pepper, and garlic powder on the chops before I browned them.  I used cooking spray rather than oil.  Our chops were a bit dry, but not too bad. I think next time I would either cover the dish to prevent the chops from drying out, or pour the soup over the top of the chops too.",

I don't think it needs to cook quite so long. I also recommend using the deepest 9x13 baking dish you have. It's a pretty tall casserole.",

Maybe throw in some bacon crunchies.  Try to stay low on salt in our house here, but could have used a little more.  Family says a definate keeper. Me too! Oh used the food processor to slice the potatoes super thin.  Worked great.",

I was concerned about the chops drying out per other reviews so I covered the casserole dish w/foil after 45 min. or so of baking. The cabbage tended to be cooked to the texture of boiled cabbage; I may have perfered a little towards al dente'. Also per reviews I sliced the potatoes fairly thin; wished I had gone thicker. My 9x13 accommodated layers of: cabbage potatoe cabbage potatoe cabbage then chops and I forgot to salt the layers until the last layer of cabbage so I salted it good then. I don't think it mattered that much. The chops were fork tender. Overall good winter comfort food.",
