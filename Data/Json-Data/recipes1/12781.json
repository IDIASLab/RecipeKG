Instead, use about 1 cup chicken broth, the juice of 2 lemons, 1 tablespoon honey and 1 tablespoon of corn starch (aka cornflour). Whisk all of these together while cold, then bring to a light boil while stirring constantly. Cook until the sauce becomes transparent and begins to thicken, then remove from heat and top chicken. This will make a much tastier and healthier sauce. Don't forget to throw in some steamed broccoli or asparagus!",
