                "reviewBody": "This behaves more like a quick bread than a yeast bread so I decided to treat it as such. I had huckleberry jam so I used that but since the submitter mentioned the sugar content in jam being different I added 2 more tbsp of sugar to make up the difference (I don't really know if that's correct but that's what I did). I did the dough in the bread machine and took it out to finish. The dough was very sticky and I thought about adding flour but decided to leave it as is and see how it worked. I made the dough relatively late last night so I put it in a bread pan and let it rise in the fridge overnight. This morning I baked it at 350 for 30 min then tested every 10 min with a toothpick until it came clean. It ended up taking 70 min to bake. I ended up with a moist sweet loaf that tastes like peanut butter with a hint of jam. It also has some peanut chunks since I used chunky peanut butter. If I had baked it in the bread machine I'm not sure how well it would've turned out even though my bread machine tends to do well with yeast breads. Still this bread is different so I'm thinking that may be why others weren't so happy with it. It's not a loaf I'd eat plain; needs butter or honey or jam but it's not bad with changes. Thanks for the recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "Well... I was a bit leery about making this bread in the first place but I decided to give it a go as a snack for my two young sisters when they got off the bus. I used creamy peanut butter and concord grape jelly and baked it on my bread machine's \"basic\" setting. It was VERY moist and hard to slice. It seemed burnt on the sides but the top and middle seemed a bit undercooked (the same problem as another reviewer - maybe we have the same bread machine?) Neither myself or my little sisters liked it spread with butter although they both LOVE the plain white and wheat breads we make weekly in the bread machine. It's important to understand that the PB&J flavors are very subtle and unless you tell someone it's peanut butter and jelly bread they'll probably think the flavor of your bread is just \"off\"....but... It is GREAT in the morning to make cinnamon toast. Other than that I'd suggest just making a good old peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead of this recipe.",
