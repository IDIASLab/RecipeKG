I found this to be moist (but really, how often do you come across a dry pumpkin bread, especially with a cup of oil?), pretty, and with the compact but tender crumb you'd expect.  It also had a deep, pumpkin color. Choosing this recipe was merely for the reason that it called for less spice than I'm used to, and no nuts or raisins. I wanted to try something different.  Unfortunately, pretty loaf as it is, a loaf that admittedly turns out perfectly, it is only mildly pumpkin flavored, and only mildly spiced.  In a word, it's basically kind of blah.  Moist, beautiful, but blah.  Amp up the spices, or add raisins, craisins, nuts or SOMETHING, and this could easily be improved to at least 4-star quality.",

I took the advice of a reviewer on there and added 1/4 tsp cloves to that blend--and it's more clovey than I like. I think next time I will make the recipe as stated. So, back to this recipe. As advised by other reviewers, I doubled the spices to 6 tsp, and the pumpkin as well (two 15oz cans vs. one can). I also eliminated the oil entirely, exchanged one cup of white sugar for a cup of brown, and added 1/2 cup of applesauce, and baked for 70 minutes. It came out so perfectly that I'm surprised a blue ribbon didn't materialize on the pan the second it came out of the oven. A perfect chewy crust and a very dense and tender crumb, just WOW. Gorgeous. I'm giving it 5 stars based on that, even though the flavor isn't quite there for me (I'm sure people who like a little more cloves than I do would be delighted with it). Once I tweak my spice blend to my own preference, I bet it will be absolutely divine.",
