                "reviewBody": "This light refreshing and nutritious salad was just what our bodies told us we needed after a couple of weeks worth of \"holiday eating.\" Some of the submitter's twists on the classic Nicoise salad worked for me but some did not. In my view this needed to be a composed not tossed salad and it needed to be served on a bed of greens - mesclun butter lettuce or Romaine for example. I used Romaine. The bottled champagne dressing would be okay in a pinch I guess but with all these beautiful and quality ingredients I believe it deserved a homemade vinaigrette - I prepared a simple and classic Lemon-Dijon Vinaigrette. The boiled new potatoes (test with a fork not a knife) are an important addition and the submitter has it right by letting them soak up some of the good salad dressing awhile before serving. The pickled green beans were too bold a deviation on the classic for me so I stuck to fresh green beans which I tossed in with the potatoes the last five minutes of cooking then removed them to an ice bath to stop the cooking process and to retain their vibrant green color. Now the salmon Hubs and I agree was an interesting and quite worthy variation from the classic tuna one Hubs particularly enjoyed. Finally except for the potatoes which were at room temperature I served this chilled not warm. All and all this was a creative interpretation of the classic Salad Nicoise that allows for individual tinkering and spin.",

Boil at medium heat. After the eggs are started add the salmon fillets and onions to the large pan. Add the green beans when close to the end. Boil eggs in a small pan. After about 20 minutes run cold water over them and peel. Once the eggs are done everything else should be about done.

The green beans I steamed as I don't like the jarred pickled kind. Additionally I added baby cucumbers and kalmata olives.

I started mine off with thin sliced smoked salmon (all I could fine here in Maine) I rolled up the salmon sprinkling them with capers and put them on a plate with a drizzle of EOV and stuck it in the refrigerator while I prepared the rest, the rest of the recipe I followed, but used cherry tomatoes rather than chopped which can have more liquid than I like and I found the \"baby\" new potato's (about 1\" in diameter).\nI did make my own salad dressing a creamy dill. Which I thought went well with the salmon.  We really liked this dish as a nice variation of the Salad Nicoise.",
