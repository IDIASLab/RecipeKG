After the crescent roll layer baked (I did mine in an 11x7 -had a few crescent rolls left over) I put the meat on, a layer of salsa, then black olives, then the sour cream (not a whole container - just enough to cover) then the cheese, followed by Doritos \"Nacho Cheesier\" chips (crumbled.)Served w/chopped tomatoes to top it with and the Absolute Mexican Cornbread from this website (along w/an asparagus dish)- EXCELLENT meal!",

So I'm rating this 5 stars FOR THE GREAT IDEA AND START TO A VERY VERSITILE RECIPE. Okay, now that that's out of the way. First, I doubled this recipe and put it in a greased 9x13 glass dish. I went w/ another reviewer and baked the dough about 4 min. less than what it called for since it will be cooking some more in the oven when it's all put together. DO NOT DO THAT. The crust was doughy and raw and soggy even after cooking the whole thing for 15 minutes at the temperature I used to cook the dough. Next time I will absolutely cook the dough ALL the way the WHOLE time it calls for. Now, I made the beef like I would normally make it for regular taco meat (add seasoning and simmer w/ water to get the consistancy). I also added 1/2 a chopped onion to the meat while it cooked. I layered it in this order: Dough/Crust, taco meat, 1 can refried beans & 1 16oz container sour cream mixed then spread on top of meat, 1/2 jar of salsa, 1 can of black beans, 1/2 bag of taco seasoned cheese & 1/2 bag of sharp cheddar, then the chips finally on top. Everything about thi was amazing minus my faulty error w/ the dough. You could always do this w/o the crust and just use for a taco dip. AMAZING recipe, thank you for the start of a great thing! This is so easy to omit and add items as you choose!",

A bonus is that I almost always have the ingredients on hand, so it is sure to be a quick dinner solution on a busy night. From start to finish it took less than 30 minutes to have the meal on the table, that is a major plus. The only suggestion that I would make is (and I should have been smart enough to figure it out)...spray the bottom of your pan with a vegetable spray. I used a glass 9 x 13 pan and thought that the crescent rolls would be buttery enough that they wouldn't stick...wrong. I garnished with the traditional taco toppings. This is a nice family recipe that was easy and enjoyed.\r\n",

Waaaay too salty for my liking between the taco seasoning and tortilla chips. Next time I will find salt-free ones.  Also, next time I will not completely cook my crecent rolls.  They got a little too browned after putting in the oven the 2nd time to melt the cheese.  I cooked mine without the sour cream as I'm not a huge fan unless it's in a dip.  I just don't enjoy the taste. I served it on the side with salsa.  Fiance said it was really good that way.  I do want to try this again, because I think this recipe really has potential.  thanks for sharing!",

I do see where some might not like the though of a sweet roll in a savory dish - but I'm a little disappointed at the negative reviews. if you see a list of ingredients that doesnt appeal to you and dont make the dish - please dont review it. 2. If you see a list of ingredients that doesnt appeal to you and you make the dish knowing you're going to hate it - why bother? 3. If you don't like chips, or think something is too much - use less.  Each recipe is made for a particular taste. I happen to love this dish, I also know that I like my tacos a bit on the spicy side - so I add some spice! no harm in that, I'm making it to my family's taste. I also dont much care for too much salt in certain dishes (I am an admitted saltaholic) so, I used unsalted toasted corn tortilla's. It's really just common sense and its really just curtesy to rate/review. See the idea behind the recipe! then adjust! Having said that.. I love this on baked/toasted pita's too!!!!
