My grandmother, my mother, and I cook this bacon for our family and friends, and it is always a favorite once it has been tried by one and all. This is excellent for breakfast, snacks, or upgrade your BLT to a place it has never been before. Once you have had bacon this way, it will be very hard to go back to the way you did it before you discover this treasure of a recipe. Something so simple CAN be so wonderful!",
