I added more honey that called for and substitued a Thai Sweet Red Pepper Chili sauce instead of the hot sauce.  It made a really nice addition.  I also added more honey than the recipe called for.  After marinading t for about an hour these turned out to be the most amazing twist on pineapple that I have ever had.  This made a great fruit even better.

I do not mean to be rude but the idea for putting on vanilla ice cream really ruined it...at least for me.  Please try it BEFORE you serve it to everyone that way.  Personally, I think I would have been much better off serving it as is..it is REALLY delicious that way.  I know though, in the end, we all have different taste buds.  But I do urge folks to try it with ice cream before making that your dish, you may thank me.",

I just patted two cans of sliced pineapple (in juice, not syrup) dry before putting them in a ziploc with the marinade (I skipped the butter and used sriracha as my hot sauce, adding a little extra) and loved the spicy zip the sriracha brought to the party.  Absolutely amazing with teriyaki marinated pork chops!",

Note for one batch we did add cinnamon sugar adn brown sugar to carmelize them on the grill. THis was even better.
