Not wanting to use that much fat, I lifted the meat out of pan and poured all the drippings into a tall narrow plastic cup. I was able to ladle the fat off very easily. I then used just two tbls of the fat (discarding rest) in a skillet and proceeded to follow this recipe. I only used one can of good beef broth as I had a lot of meaty drippings despite having gotten rid of all the fat (about a cup or more!). The results were magnificent and still rich and decadent despite losing all that fat. It made an ample amount of the most delicious \"jus\" you've ever tasted. Not a real thick gravy, not a real thin pure jus either, but fantastic nonetheless.",
