I added about a table spoon  and a half of corn starch to thicken it up. It really helped. Be sure to stir it well thought to get out all the chunks. I also doubled the amount of cayenne pepper b/c I really like spice food. It made the dish have a nice zing to it. If you've ever had spicy chicken and shrimp at a restaurant...this tastes just like it. I also chopped up the chicken as recommended by other reviewers. I didn't want to go through the hassle of grilling the shrimp so I cooked it along with my cubed chicken and it turned out great like that. It gives the shrimp a chance to cook in the wine and olive oil to soak up the flavors too. This is a great meal for the whole family. Enjoy!",

When both are done, remove from pan. Deglaze the pan with the wine, add the butter, then add the cream. I'd omit the milk. Add seasoning to your sauce and reduce to your desired consistency. Plate the pasta, divide chicken and shrimp, top with your good sauce. Never leave the goodness from saut\u00e9ing meat in the bottom of your pan! That's the secret to a great sauce.",

Would make it again with some adjustments. We also cut up the chicken before tossing it with the pasta and sauce. Michele Cambridge Ontario",
