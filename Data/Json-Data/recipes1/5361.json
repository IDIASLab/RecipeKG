I made a few modifications that helped with the soggy/gooey problems. I tried cream brie - a bit difficult to 'chop' but can be heated slightly and then spread/mashed in with the cranberries - and to avoid the soggy crust issue I used whole-berry cranberry sauce draining the watery liquid off first. A little fresh ground pepper and some red wine vinegar with the chicken added a nice touch to the overall flavor. I will definately be making this again. Thanks!",

So I browned bite size pieces of chicken breast in Rosemary & Thyme (4 spice bottle capfulls of each) with a little olive oil and drained. I also used brie on bottom of Boboli crust then chicken then dried cranberries topped with mozz cheese and more dried cranberries. Took to office pot luck and yummers was the opinion. Only one slice remained and yours truly ate it for dinner that night.",
