I consider recipes to be guidelines and always consider the recipe reviews.  Here are the changes I made: I used 2 cups of dry plain bread cubes, 2 eggs, Lawry's seasoning salt, 1 t of jarred roasted garlic, 1 cup of mozzarella (in an attempt to make it lighter), a chopped green onion and 3 cups of zucchini.  I also baked it in an 8 by 8 dish.  We had it as the main part of the meal and loved it, the bread was perfect and not mushy and the zucchini was tender. It had lots of flavor and the extra egg helped hold it together.  It surpassed my expectations and I plan to make it again except make a little more so it fills the 8 by 8 dish more.  Thank you for a yummy, inexpensive, beautiful to look at and nutritious recipe!",

I put 1/3 of the cheese mixed in the casserole sprinkled the rest on top. I added some Lawerys seasoning as well. Put in a 8x8 pan and cooked 20 minutes covered, 20 minutes uncovered. Perfection!",

This recipe is so simple and tasty. I like to vary the bread and found that chewy breads such as french or italian, lend a wonderful texture. Try differernt cheeses too. Monterrey Jack or Muenster are great. Other than that, I don't change a thing except maybe less onion. This casserole, along with a salad, has become one of my favorite meals. What makes it even more special is when I go to my desert garden and pick a lovely, fresh zucchini just for this dish! Plant some zucchini and you will be well rewarded.",

It was a really nice side dish, tasty without overpowering.  I used a Monterrey Jack type cheese, and only about 1.5 cups (all I had).  I also used day-old bakery bread,  toasted in the toaster oven, but the 4 slices of that looked like too much bread, so I added another half-cup of zucchini.  Oh, and at that point, it looked too dry, so I added a second egg.  But even with all those adjustments, it came out very yummy.  I also used an 11x17 pan, based on another reviewer's suggestion.  I highly recommend this! It was an excellent compliment to a simple marinated, grilled chicken breast.",
