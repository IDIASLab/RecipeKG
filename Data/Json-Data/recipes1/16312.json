This casserole is great following the original recipe, but I probably added more french onions than what was called for, 1 tbsp Worcestershire, added some cheddar cheese, and some seasonings (primarily garlic powder, salt, pepper). You might think the bread crumbs aren't needed but they seriously are, it thickens the soup making the dish wonderfully creamy. Dish was inhaled. As for another review that said they don't use GMO's, I checked my can and apparently they do now, disappointing for me because I am not pro-GMO but can't seem to escape them so I still use GMO products, at least until my heirloom garden comes in.",
