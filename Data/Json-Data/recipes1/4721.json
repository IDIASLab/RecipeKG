I also cooked it for about 40 minutes, and I disolved a spoonful of corn starch in about 1/3 cup of cold water and added right at the end of cooking. This made a nice thick sauce. I made rice and broccoli as recommended. After dinner, I just put all the leftovers, (chicken, sauce, rice, and broccoli) in one bowl and brought it for lunch today. It was really good all mixed up too! Thanks for sharing this recipe!",

I took others' advise and tripled the sauce without tripling everything and I'm glad that I did. 9 Tbs. ketchup 6 Tbs. soy sauce 5 1/2 Tbs. white sugar 6 Tbs. lemon juice 1 1/2 tsp black pepper. This was perfect. Not too sweet and not too hot. The reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because serving this dish with rice is a must and should have been included that way. The recipe should have at least doubled the sauce as well. I also cubed my chicken because it looked so tasty in the photos that way. I think my changes are what made this dish a success. Overall served over rice with brocolli and a nice loaf of French bread this meal was a hit with my family.",
