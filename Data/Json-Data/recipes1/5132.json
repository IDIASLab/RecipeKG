I think it should be a little bit cooler to serve though! The center is still really soft. I suspect that anybody who has a failure with this recipe will be tripped up by step number 3. Here's how to keep them from collapsing and to avoid the egginess. Where the recipe says \"In a separate bowl, combine the eggs, vanilla, sugar and flour.\"  Don't just stir them together, since there is no leavening in this recipe except the eggs, beat them with the sugar until thick and light lemon colored (about 3-4 minutes with a Kitchenaid) before adding the flour, vanilla and then the chocolate mixture. I got 18 cupcakes from my batch.",

Also, these do need a pinch or two of baking powder to help them rise. Other than that, a fabulous recipe!",
