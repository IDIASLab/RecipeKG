I put some minced garlic in the cavity along with the lemons and rosemary.  I put a mixture of 1/4c, butter, 1/2 tsp. minced garlic, juice from 1 quarter of the lemon and some dried crushed rosemary(I mashed this all together) and put in under the breast skin.  It mad the breast meat super flavorful and tender.  I used minced garlic instead of cloves, and it burnt during the roasting part(425) so if you ar doing the minced garlic, you might want to add part of the wine and broth mixture so that it wont burn.  The gravy was delicious, I did however add a little cornstarch to thicken it up.  Served this with Gourmet Sweet Potato Cassarole(on this site), Basic Yankee Bread Stuffing(on this site), Mashed Potatoes, Green beans, Mushrooms and Cranberries.  I also did as someone suggested to put mushrooms into the juices the last 20 minutes of cooking. What a meal!",

Since there are only two in my house, I made two games hens, but left the wine and broth the same (basically the sauce I kept the same) and it turned out perfectly.  If I used four hens, I would double the sauce because when I boiled the sauce down it was perfect for two hens.  ABSOLUTLEY WONDERFUL.  Thank you for a new favorite, and very moist, game hen recipe...Shannon",

I did make a few modifications, I used 2 hens since it's just my husband and I, In the cavity of each bird I put a quarter lemon, 2 cloves of garlic and 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary. I read the recipe wrong and actually rubbed 1 tbsp of olive oil on each hen, but still came out good. I then put 1 tbsp butter under the skin on each breast, along with 2 sprigs of the fresh rosemary. I sprinkled some poultry seasoning on each hen along with a lemon slice on the breast and then placed them in my roasting pan on top of cubed yukon gold potatoes. After roasting I took 2/3 c. of cheap pinot grigio, 2/3 c. chicken broth, and about 5 cloves of minced garlic and used that to pour over the hens and baste with. Holy cats was this great! My whole house smelt amazing, and the potatoes were the best I'd ever had! I loved how everything cooked all at once and all I had to do was throw together a salad. My husband raved about this recipe, and picked his hen clean. We loved it so much I'm going to be adapting this recipe to a roasting chicken tonight for dinner. Hope it comes out just as good. Thanks you for sharing a great recipe!",

I definitely added some stock to the pan right away like other suggested and I'm glad I did - the garlic definitely would have burned. I almost tripled the sauce for two hens and had a little bit of sauce left over. Next time I'll definitely season the inside of the bird before stuffing it with lemon and rosemary.",
