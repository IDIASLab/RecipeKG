I couldn't bring myself to broil these, I've always pan fried, so I used 1 Tbsp butter and a few Tbsp Vegetable oil on med/high heat.  These are filling, so I served on toasted buns with tomatoes and a wonderful veggie medley on the side.    Thanks for the recipe!",

What a hit this was.  If you use the broiler instead of frying on med-high ...please check them often as they should not dark in color as some have shown but a golden brown. ",

I chopped the onion and celery super fine and used just a little less onion than 1/4c. I was skeptical about broiling them because I have always pan fried my crabcakes but WOW! They were as good if not better that pan fried. It took about 5-6 min per side under the broiler. I used whole lump crab on sale 2lb for 16. I will be making these this way from now on. As a topper sauce I took one part mayo one part Di'jon mustard and a splash of Worstershire sauce and mixed it and placed a dollop on top. EXCELLENT!",
