It is imperative that the flour and milk be thoroughly combined before cooking and that the mixture be cooked to a texture of wet mashed potatoes both for firmness and to cook out the flour taste. Be sure it is chilled before adding it to the butter, or obviously it will melt the butter. This is a great recipe.",
