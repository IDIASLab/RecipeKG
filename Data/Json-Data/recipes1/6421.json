I came up with my own after lots of experimenting that feeds us all and sticks together well. I pack it tightly in a 9x 13 greased pan. I use: 2/3 cup butter or margarine 1 cup corn syrup (I spray the cup with PAM so the syrup comes out easily) 2 cups brown sugar 2 tsp. vanilla 5 Tbsp. cocoa powder (add more if you like a more chocolate flavour) and 10 to 10 1/2 cups puffed wheat cereal Then I pretty much follow the directions that the submitter uses though I don't time the boiling of the mixture. Once it gets fairly bubbly then I remove it from the heat. I also use a medium pot because I'm too lazy to butter the sides. Brenda--It's been a while since I made any but you could try decreasing some of the brown sugar (I don't pack the brown sugar when I measure it). You could try reducing your boiling time if that doesn't work. That's tricky though because not enough and they won't stick; too much and they get hard. Time the boil for right about a minute or slightly less and you should be good. Or grab a candy thermometer and go for a soft ball stage. Honestly I can't remember ever having any leftovers to notice if it goes hard but I think over boiling is generally what makes the syrup/squares harden quickly.",

After a bit of a search I have found the most used recipe is: 1/2 c butter 1/2c corn syrup 1cup brown sugar 2 tsp cocoa 2 tsp. vanilla for 8 cups of puffed wheat. As well by rapid boiling the syrup for one minute I think most people without a candy thermometer run the risk of taking it to a hard candy stage (hence the comments about rock hard squares). Bring the syrup to boil and as soon as it hits rapid boil remove it from heat. Should work out better for most people.",

More like 5 tablespoons if you want a seriously choclatey square...and why wouldn't you?? Try this:  2/3 cup corn syrup, 1 cup lightly packed brown sugar, 5 Tablespoons cocoa..bring to a boil, add 1/2 cup butter, and then boil approx 45 seconds.  Remove from heat and add 2 tsp vanilla.  Add to 8 cups of puffed wheat or puffed kamut.  Press into 9x13 pan (another reviewer suggests wetting palms of your hands then pressing, this works great). A great treat on a hot summer day (which it is in Perth Australia right now) when you don't want to turn on the oven. Another great TIP I just discovered.  I always save the paper or foil from butter and keep it in the freezer...use it to grease pans.  Anyway, after I lightly pressed the puffed wheat into the pan, I laid a butter paper over and pressed with my hands, works like a bomb!",
