I served the meatballs over rice but I might try noodles sometime. A word of caution, try to pace yourself while eating these it's easy to inhale a couple dozen and these deserve to be savored!",

Also, looking at the mix of ingredients it seemed to me that it would produce a really  \"wet\" mixture.  I decided to hold off adding the chicken broth and I'm glad I did as the texture and consistency was just right without it.  Had I used it, I'm afraid it might have been too loose, making it more difficult to form the meatballs.  I did add the optional ginger.  Glad I did that too.  I formed the mixture into approximately 1\" meatballs, and these required  only about 18 minutes in the oven at 400 degrees.   I used butter in place of the drippings for the roux.  The sour cream was different for me - I generally use heavy cream.  Wasn't sure I would like it as much, but not to worry, other than there being a little too much of it, we liked it nearly as well as we do when made with cream.  All and all, a good recipe - just needs some tweaking, I think, to perfect it to suit individual tastes and preferences.",

                "reviewBody": "Yuuuummmm!    This was so good - it vaguely reminds me of the Swedish meatballs my mother used to make whenever there was a party.   I didn't have time for \"day-old\" bread, so I lightly toasted two slices and crumbled those with the cream.  Also,  I used a bit more meat (closer to 1 lb. of beef, 1/2 lb. of pork) but otherwise everything else was the same.   I recommend using all the spices incl. the brown sugar and ginger.   They blend beautifully and the taste is subtle and delicious.   Great recipe; thanks to NomNomNom for posting!",

I think there were errors in cooking time, it took me well over 2 hours to make this and I am not an amatuer cook. I also think that if you try this recipe, do not add the sour cream to the simmered sauce unless you temper the sour cream or it can curdle. I'm sorry but very disapointed in this recipe. I only gave it a two star beccause the meatball was tender and moist which is always nice. Just thought too much went into this",
