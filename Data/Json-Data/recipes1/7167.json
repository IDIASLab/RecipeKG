However once the chicken dish was completely cooked I was not impressed with the overall taste. It needed much more seasoning. It's hard to believe given the amount you use on the chicken. Perhaps the chicken broth really dilutes the flavors. The only way I could save this dish was to add a can of crushed tomatoes. That is just what this dish needed! Only then could my family and I really taste the seasonings from the chicken. This dish was great once I added the tomatoes!",

I made the following changes: customized it to 2 servings used half the amount of pasta substitued chili powder for Cajun seasoning and crushed red pepper flakes as I had none and used twice as much chicken broth. It was easy and very good. I added olive oil salt pepper and parmesan cheese to the pasta while it was waiting for the chicken and it turned out delicious! Will definitely make again.",

I cooked the standard amount of pasta I usually use for four servings. Instead of measuring the spices I simply seasoned both sides of the chicken breasts liberally then added some additional spice to the sauce. I used one and a half cans of chicken broth and to thicken sauce added 2tbsp. flour mixed with 2tbsp. broth close to the end of the simmering time. The last minute of cooking I added a splash of skim milk 2tbsp. fat free sour cream and a couple cups of cherry tomatoes that I had sliced in half. This created a lovely fragrant and rich sauce that is still fairly 'healthy'. The cherry tomatoes added both zing and sweetness. Served with broccoli on the side drizzled with the sauce...YUM! Am excited about the leftovers I brought for lunch!",
