Best pork roast I've ever had or made! \n\nA few notes - I used fresh squeezed orange juice, about 1/4 cup chicken broth instead of bouillon, dried cherries instead of raisins, and skipped the starch. It probably came out a bit more \"broth-y\" than the original recipe intends, but it was still fantastic! Also, another reviewer mentioned it was too salty for their taste - my husband and I did not notice the salt at all, but perhaps using chicken broth instead of bouillon mitigated the salt content.",

I was a little hesitant about 3 Tablespoons of Curry - but no worries this was awesome. I didn't have potato starch so I used a litttle bit of cornstarch mixed with cold water but didn't thicken the sauce until the meat was done. I served this with Jasmine rice and steamed green beans. Hubby says that this is \"Meat and Potato\" guy approved. I will be making this again for sure. As a side note I used a 4 quart slow cooker and there was more than enough room maybe even a little bit big for this recipe.",

So I have made this 3 times now and have decided with a little tweaking of the original recipe it could get a 5 star from me. This is what I think helps but everyone has a different prefernce so see what you think: I doubled all the ingredients and only added 1/2 pound more pork. I added 1/2 of a can of chunked Pineapple and the Pineapple juice in the can I mixed with the Orange Juice. I didn't add the water with potatoe starch because I prefer it more soupy and think the juices seep into the pork better when it is thinner liquid. I also am using dried cranberries as well as the raisins. The cranberries actually have better flavor and is more complimentary to the recipe. I also used sweetened coconut flakes instead of unsweetened. This is the only Paleo recipe I could find on this site and I was thrilled! Thank you!",

After cooking 4 hours I  plucked an orange from my tree and added a tsp of the zest. I did not add coconut but planned to add coconut milk if it needed it, but it didn't in my opinion.  I just used pork chops what was on sale at the store,and cut them up. Very tender sweet and spicy-really delicious- economical- healthy and EASY. Can make sauce thick by adding cornstarch and cold water together at end of cooking but I liked it soupy.",

I only have a bunch of cuties on hand so I peeled them and just threw them in the pot (and mashed them up in the pot) didn't have an apple so used applesauce instead. Didn't have raisins so used dates and didn't like coconut so omitted them. Didn't have a slow cooker so just cooked them in a pot for slightly under an hour. Last thing added frozen broccoli in towards the end of the cooking time. I actually enjoy the taste (without the coconut) very much and the orange pulp made the potato starch redundant. Such an easy but yummy meal to make!! Would be doing this often from now on!",
