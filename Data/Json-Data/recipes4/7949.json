Well as I was mixing the ingredients I found I did not have everything I needed. Such as only 2 eggs no wheat germ or coconut oil. So I increased the flax seed to 1/2 cup to make up for the egg (flax can be used as an egg sub) and wheat germ and used veg oil instead. They came out amazing. Light and moist. This is definitely going into the recipe book.",
