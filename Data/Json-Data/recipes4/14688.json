I misread the ingredients and only had regular beef broth (not condensed) so I used 3/4c broth and added two boullion cubes the 1/4c water called for. It had a stroganoff-type flavor so we served it over egg noodles but it would be great with potatoes or rice as well. Thank you Erin A! This is a keeper and a great way to use our wild game. If you like a lot of gravy I'd consider doubling that part - a lot of it had soaked up by the next day's lunch.",

He ate bowl after bowl, my children raved! I was to nervous to throw all cautioun to the wind, but  I took a good sized taste.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.

Changes I made included rubbing the roast with Montreal Steak Seasoning then browning the roast in a hot pan with a little oil (on all sides) before putting in the slow cooker. I also decreased the pepper to 1 teaspoon instead of a tablespoon. I didn't have onion gravy mix so I made a roux in the cast iron pan (in which I just browned the roast) using a little more oil and 2 tablespoons of flour to which I added the rest of the liquid ingredients. Once all that was smooth and without lumps I added it to the crockpot and walked away from it for 8 hours. Fantastic!!",
