I wanted to include a few more veggies for color and taste.  Along with the green onion I chopped some leek, carrot, and shallot.  Instead of adding to the broth, I cooked in 1 Tbsp. butter and 1 Tbsp. olive oil adding some garlic at this point.  After veggies were softened I added a large can of chicken broth which ends up being more than the recipe calls for but it works. For the rice I used 1 package of Uncle Ben's Wild Rice.  I cut the amount of butter and flour to 1/4 cup of each and then added 1/2 c. half and half, 1/2 c. lowfat milk, the poultry seasoning, and the seasoning packet from the Uncle Ben's Rice.  I omitted the salt and pepper.  There is plenty of salt in the broth and the seasoning mix.  Also, I did not use bacon but put some bacon bits on the side so the kids could sprinkle them on.  Making these changes cuts quite a bit of the fat.  Adding the seasoning packet gives it a great flavor.  Trust me it was fantastic.",

I used turkey stock and I didn't have any half in half so I used 1 c. heavy cream and 1 c. skim milk. I also substituted brandy for the sherry because that is what I had on hand. One other thing just heat the soup through if you continue to simmer the soup continues to thicken and this changed the flavor slightly. Excellent recipe I would recommend that anyone try this.",

I started with 2 tbsp olive oil and saut\u00e9ed 1 tbsp minced garlic then added diced celery and carrots. After cooking for 5 minutes I added about 3 cups of chopped potato. To this I added my broth and rice. Because I was wary that the soup would be too bland I added 2 tsp dried oregano 2 tsp dried basil 1/2 tsp pepper and 2 tsp dried parsley. I also knew the soup would be WAY to thick using an entire 3/4 cup of flour so I scaled it back to 1/2 cup. I also used whole milk to cut back on the fat a little. When I added the cream mixture to the rice mixture it was more like rice pudding than soup so I ended up adding another 4 or 5 cups of chicken broth to make it creamy soup consistency. Oh I also didn't bother with the bacon because I had none. So all in all a good start and with my changes it turned out to be a nice soup. It was a HUGE batch however so I froze some for later.
