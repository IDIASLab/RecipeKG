Mozarella cheese spilled out for me when baking though, not sure how to fix that.  Everyone liked. Is a keeper for a healthier patty!",

I mixed up all the ingredients in the first step--the ONLY thing I did differently was to use half the amount of cloves. I wish I had left them out completely because the flavor of cloves and fresh basil was overpowering. Second the mixture was so wet and sticky there was no way to roll them into balls and then in cracker crumbs. I ended up mixing the crumbs into the chicken so it would hold together and then scooping them into \"balls\". Even then they were still way too soft to fry in oil so I baked them like another reviewer had done. Once baked they had a nice texture and got crunchy on the outside but they tasted awful! My husband was really hungry and managed to eat several by dipping them in mustard but he said they still tasted too much like cloves.",
