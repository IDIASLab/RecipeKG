Instead of microwaving them, I just baked five sweet potatoes for an hour at 400 degrees (after puncturing the skin, of course), then peeled the skin off the potatoes and mashed them up with Amaretto, ground ginger and cinnamon.  The sweet potatoes are so soft after being baked that you don't really need to mash them.  Tastes amazing!",

I put my cut up peeled sweet potatoes in a covered casserole dish for 3.5 min on high then turned them and put them in again for same amt of time. Then they were perfect for mashing. I also put a little bit of water in with them when microwaving so they would not get dried out drained it off before mashing. Worked great! I also did not use almonds b/c I was in a hurry but it would be pretty and I am sure taste great maybe next time.",

I baked whole sweet potatoes wrapped in foil in the oven until very soft (90 minutes?) then let them sit on the counter until I was ready for them. They held the heat very well this way. I used the maple syrup & couple shakes of ginger & cinnamon each. I did add just a splash of orange juice. Outstanding healthy easy side dish I'll definitely make again. Don't forget the almonds! - they are a really nice touch.",

I boiled the yams rather than microwaving them--for some reason I just felt weird putting them in the microwave! I'll probably make this very easy recipe again:)",
