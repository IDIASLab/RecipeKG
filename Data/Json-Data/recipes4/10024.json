I was about to give up when I found this recipe and hit the jackpot! I changed this recipe from the original but I'm sure the original tastes fine. I used 2 cans chicken broth with an extra 1/2 c. water for the 4 cups water for rice. I used Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice and per directions 2 1/3 c. of water but added 2 chicken bouillon cubes. I'm not sure how I could cook it per directions (wild rice) then not drain as all the water is absorbed so I cooked till it looked like the parboiled rice. I also did not drain the mushrooms and added 1 c. ham cubed to the mixture. It was really tasty and I like how I can play with the ingredients and feel comfortable that our dinner will be good! oh yeah I also cooked 375 degrees for 35 min. in our gas oven on middle rack uncovered and all was cooked through.",

I would probably actually give it only 3 stars but I didn't want to mess up the rating (since I think many people might like this). Just a little boring for us. Not a bad dish but I doubt if I'll make it again. I think it would have been a lot better with saut\u00e9ed onions mixed into it and twice the sauce. It wasn't dry but I think making it saucier would be even better. I also topped it with French fried onions. That was a nice touch. I used a rotisserie chicken. The nice thing is that I made two 8x8 dishes and froze one. Although I hope the next one won't be really dry.",
