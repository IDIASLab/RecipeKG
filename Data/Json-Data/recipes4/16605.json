It\u2019s sort of like lasagna, but not lasagna, gooey, cheesy, and just plain delicious. But I followed the recipe loosely. First, why sink the peppers into a quarter inch of water?  As I always do when I make stuffed peppers, I used my own tomato sauce instead, tho\u2019 commercial tomato sauce is a fine substitute, and much better than water!  You\u2019ll want that extra sauce to spoon over your peppers!  Also, I used a medley of colored peppers, as I find store-bought green peppers a little on the strong and somewhat bitter side.  I added chopped onion, minced garlic, and fresh parsley and oregano to the meat and simply used tomato sauce, no tomato paste.  (I am not a huge fan of tomato paste, which seems to contribute a sweetness I don\u2019t care for)  I just cooked it down to the consistency that seemed right.  I used no cheddar.  Even had it on hand, but thought all mozzarella was more fitting.  I ate mine as is, but served Hubs\u2019 with rice, knowing it would be his preference.  (Well, um, mine too, but I\u2019ve got to watch the carbs more and more as I get older.  Hrumph.)  These were done in 50 minutes, and I added the second sprinkling of mozzarella during the last five minutes.  At 50 minutes the peppers were fork tender but still had enough firmness to maintain their shape and not be limp and mushy.  (Note:  I used a pound of meat for just 2-1/2 peppers, and it was just right)",

I did substitute ricotta for the cottage cheese as suggested by the cook, a 15oz. container was perfect. I didn't need all the sauce for the filling, so put some of the reserved sauce on our rice and then topped with the peppers. I waited to top with the last sprinkle of cheese the last five minutes of baking. My peppers were done to perfection in 50 minutes. I did add in a chopped onion to my hamburger mixture and a bit more Italian herbs, basil and parsley to the sauce, since I have some fresh in my garden. My husband could not stop raving about this meal. This one is a keeper!",

I made my own meat sauce rather than follow the sauce recipe here just because I like my own sauce better than any other I have tried. I also used parmesan cheese as is mentioned in the cook's notes and I didn't put in the cheddar. I just can't think of cheddar cheese as belonging in any type of lasagna dish. I followed the suggestion of putting some of the tomato sauce in the bottom of the baking dish instead of water and that worked fine. I will try these again but will substitute the cheese filling from the recipe on this site for Ricotta Stuffed Zucchini for the plain cottage or ricotta cheese. I think the dish will have a little more taste and body to it. The recipe as written is good and it is a low carb way to get a lasagna taste. With a little tweaking I think it will be a great dish.",
