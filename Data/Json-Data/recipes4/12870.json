It tasted like barbaqued spare ribs!!!  I will keep this recipe on hand and use it again.  I did not find just a chile-garlic sauce, so I used Cholula chile-garlic sauce.  The sauce and the meat had a zing to it.  I did not cook the onion and garlic before hand.  I put everything in the crock pot and it sat overnight in the fridge.  I cooked it on low all day.  I then made some rice and served the meat and sauce over the rice.  It was a very tasty meal.",
