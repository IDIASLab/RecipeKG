We have a slight variation to this recipe in my family, adding a little chopped cilantro and we use the green peppers not the red peppers that your recipe calls for.  I find the red peppers to be sweet whereas the green peppers add a bit of depth to the flavor profile.   But I love your recipe offered because it specifies Carolina rice and every Belizean I know sticks to that brand!",

I did add just a bit of dried thyme. We just got back from a trip to Belize a couple of weeks ago, having eaten this dish several times while we were there. \nThose who are thinking this dish is bland, well -- that's because it IS. It's supposed to be! It's meant to be eaten with other items which might be highly seasoned, not as a stand-alone. While the addition of garlic and coconut milk is delicious, it's subtle, and the rice-and-beans benefited from some added thyme and a grind of fresh pepper after cooking.",
