I was a little worried while it cooked because it smelled like nothing but soy sauce but once it was done my DH was using a spoon to get all the juices out of the baking dish! I used a little less EVOO and only marinated for two hours and I think that was plenty. I used about half the cheese called for and no red bell pepper (hate that stuff!) I took other reviewers advice and left out the bacon and secured it with toothpicks instead of twine. I thought all that olive oil kept it moist enough without adding more fat with bacon grease! I cooked it for 50 minutes at 350 degrees and it was a tiny bit on the dry side so watch your oven and don't go over the 145 internal temp recommended by the poster of this recipe. I can't wait to make this again we loved it!",

I cooked mine to the point of almost crispy.  Then I wilted my fresh spinach leaves in the bacon grease.   I also roasted and peeled the skin on my red peppers prior to slicing.   I cooked my rolled contraption in the oven until 142 degrees internal temp (145 would be too done for our taste) and let rest for 15 minutes.  Sprinkle parsley over the top and serve.  The meat was SO tender you didn\u2019t need a knife to cut it.  These simple changes make such a difference in this dish.  It turns it into something you\u2019d expect to see at a very nice restaurant.   This is an absolutely wonderful recipe and SO easy to make.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us!!",

I used a package of thin cut flank steak that was cut into individual servings (super cheap). I think it took a little more time because I had to roll each individual steak but it was definitely worth it. I used toothpicks to hold them together three for each. They were easy to put in and easy to take out. The bacon didn't cook all of the way so I would suggest cooking the bacon half-way first and then layering it on top of the steak pieces. The flavors were outstanding the presentation was beautiful and we will be making this again! Thank you for developing and sharing this recipe with us!",
