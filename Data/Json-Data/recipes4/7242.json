Also I didnt have generic curry powder but I did have tikka masala spice blend so I used that, also added about a tablespoon of smoked paprika and a little bit of ground ginger.\nI forgot to add garlic\nI also decided not to add salt, and didn't feel it suffered for it, the spices gave it plenty of flavour and worked well with the maple syrup.\nLast of all I used 3 tbsp of oil and 3 tbsp of maple syrup (rather than 2 like the recipe said.\n\nI have to say, I was a little dubious about the claim to 'bake for about 20 minutes', I was right to be. After 30 minutes the veg was still pretty much raw.\nI left it another 30 minutes (1hr total) and then it was nice.\nId definitely par boil the potatoes and cauliflower for about 10 minutes first before seasoning & roasting/baking, otherwise allow for a full hour in the oven.",
