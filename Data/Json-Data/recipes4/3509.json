They tasted very similar to gyros I have had at greek restaurants.  The prep is a little timely and I actually didn't have the time to let the meat sit in the refrigerator before putting it in the oven and I was impressed at the flavor the meat had.  The only thing I did different is I added 1/2 tsp. allspice per another recipe and did not use thyme. Another recipe called for 1/2 tsp coriander but I didn't have it and will probably add that next time. My picky husband loved the meat and actually ate it leftover and he NEVER eats leftovers. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!",

I know that it sounds like a lot, but I love garlic and it totally worked.  I also upped the salt as well.  Not sure exactly how much I used, but it was more than the recipe called for.  Not much, but I actually wanted it to taste salty like the gyros that you'd get from a restaurant.  One more thing I did was grill it on the barbeque outside.  I started it wrapped in foil and after 20 mins ( I turned it to ensure even cooking during this time) I took the foil off and grilled it on the open grill.  It was WONDERFUL!  Not exactly like what you'd get at a gyro place, but pretty close.  All of my friends couldn't believe that I made them at home. To answer the reviewer who wondered whether or not the food processor makes a difference, I have to say that it definitely does!  Processing the meat till it's paste-like makes a HUGE difference!  the texture is completely different than it would have been if I'd just left it as it was. I gave it 4 start because of the mods I made to it, but I really liked this recipe and I will definitely be making this again!",

                "reviewBody": "We thought this recipe was a little bland.  I used a whole onion (since I hate having half an onion lying around) and doubled the garlic and thought it could use even more.  I think the biggest problem of this recipe was the salt.  1/4t. for 2lbs of meat is not nearly enough.  Healthier, yes, but not as tasty. I wanted to be a little conservative with the salt since I was serving it with Tzatziki (a little salty) and feta (quite salty), so I only doubled the amount.  It could have used even more.  Sure, you can add salt to the pieces later, but I think the flavor would be better if the meat was salted throughout.  Next time, I think I\u2019ll try 1.5t. or 2t.  I cooked it in an 8.5\u201d loaf pan and it took about an hour.  I also had to leave the mixture in the food processor for much longer to get a tacky texture, so if your processor is older or cheap like mine, you may have to do the same.  All in all, I thought it did resemble gyro meat and would resemble it even more if you tossed the pieces on a grill before serving.  It was moist, yet not greasy.  I will make it again, but will try to spice it up a bit more.      ",

Subsequent times I used the ground lamb/beef combo when a local grocer started carrying ground lamb and it was fabulous.  I followed the directions for ingredients, but I do the following things differently, when I take the loaf out of the oven, I drain off whatever grease, then place a cold loaf pan on top, inside the 2nd loaf pan I placed 2 small hand bar-bell wieghts ( I didnt have a brick) this compresses the meat even further as it cools.  I then place the loaf into the freezer.  I happen to have a cheap meat slicer and slice the loaf as thin strips.  Making sandwiches, I take the strips of gyros, then fry them lightly oiled skillet (your oil of choice).  I like doing it that way, seems to replicate the texture and also a nice warm meat in the sandwich. Have had nothing but compliments on this receipe!  Thank you sooo much for sharing this!!  10-stars if I could give it that many!!",

I upped the salt to a teaspoon, though, as I thought 1/4 tsp would have left the meat bland.  Mine took longer to cook than the directions stated.  I found that a paper towel was an excellent way to squeeze the water from the onions.  The onions came right out and did not stick to the paper towel and then I only had to throw the paper towel away for easy clean-up.  The next time I make this meat, I'll save the juice that bakes off and cover the meat with it in the fridge to keep it moist.  Live and learn!",
