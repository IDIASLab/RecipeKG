For those of you that are not familiar with  nutritional yeast it is quite good on it's own and has somewhat of a cheesy flavor. Shh, don't tell my carnivore friends that the last two recipes I made were vegetarian and they were quite good.",

I also added another 1/4c of nutritional yeast with the salsa as I am a big fan.  Pretty spicy and very delicious.  Not only a really good dip but I see this as something to dress tacos or use as an enchilada sauce.  It's even good out of the fridge, not that I've stood there with a bag of chips eating it  with the fridge door open or anything...  I didn't have any margarine so I just used 2T olive oil.  I decreased the salt to .5t anticipating that the salsa would add plenty of salt and whatever I was eating this sauce on.",
