To make the recipe kosher I omitted both the fish sauce and oyster sauce. I subbed the 2 of them with 1 tablespoon soy sauce. 2. When I went to cut up my mushrooms it turned out they were spoiled so I had to use canned instead. I also used canned baby corn. 3. I threw in some cubed chicken cutlets to make a full meal. 4. I added some crushed red pepper flakes instead of the red chile pepper. I also left out the cilantro. Overall it was good but not 5 stars. I will try it again using fresh mushrooms. EDIT: Tonight I made it again using fresh mushrooms- made a world of difference. I also used 2 Tb soy sauce and 1 Tb Worcestershire for the fish oyster soy sauce which also made a huge difference. I added 4 chicken cutlets like last time but left the sauce the same and it was still enough. Used dried instead of fresh cilantro. Overall a healthy filling and tasty meal!",
