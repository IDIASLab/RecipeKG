Since I work full-time, I only had about 2 1/2 hours until mealtime.  My husband and son loved it - the coating was tasty and the pan juice was not burned, but just right and also delicious.  I did modify the recipe in 2 ways - I seared it at 450 for about 15 minutes, then turned the temp down to 325 and cooked until 150 internal temp, and I added a little evoo to the rub to make it more spreadable and add a little crisp.  The lamb turned out perfect - I saved this recipe in my favorites and will DEFINITELY make it again! :)",

The only change I made was to press a couple cloves of garlic into the dill/rosemary rub. The dish turned out tender, juicy, and tasty. I served it with seasoned potatoes and corn. Will make again - an easy way to impress dinner guests. Try this one, you definitely won't be disappointed.",

This recipe doesn't call for nearly enough (I'm a huge fan.) I didn't realize I was out of dill so I just made a rub of 3 tsps dried rosemary a little olive oil and some salt/pepper (not sure on amounts...just to \"taste\"). I started it at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and then turned it down to 350-375 (my oven is not reliable). When I turned the heat down I added some red potatoes & carrots to the pan. I basted the lamb with a cup of beer (hefe). The temperature & beer are based off the recipe \"Dragon's Leg of Lamb with Garlic and Beer\" on this site. I took it out after about 1 1/2 hours total because my temperature was 150. And I loved the flavor I got on the potatoes/carrots due to the basting I did with the beer/juices at the bottom. I wish I would have added more veggies to my pan.",
