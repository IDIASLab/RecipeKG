        "description": "This is a basic recipe for non-traditional chili using steak. My wife is allergic to chili powder, so I don't use any in this recipe, but you are welcome to add some if you like. This is a very tame, full-flavor, colorful chili recipe that even the kids will like. There are plenty of other variations that you can use with this basic recipe, please change at will. Things we have tried include adding three or four fresh jalapenos, or adding Tabasco&reg; habanaro sauce, or cilantro, or fresh tomatoes, or using red, yellow, orange, and green peppers, or hamburger instead of a steak or roast. Serve with tortilla chips, cheese and sour cream.",

So I added 1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder 1 tsp cumin and 1 tsp salt. I also sort of halved the recipe when I realized 4 cans of beans would make more than could fit in my crockpot...so 1 lb of beef 1/2 an onion 1 can of kidney beans 1 can of black beans 1 can of corn and just two peppers..1 green 1 red. The rest of the ingredients remained the same. And I added mushrooms cause they sounded good. Turned out perfect. A hit with everyone at the potluck. And I can't wait to eat up the leftovers. Good stuff!!",
