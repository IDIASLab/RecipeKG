It was incredible! Beans were also fresh out of the garden. We have chickens so I threw in 3 eggs Kids absolutely loved it and told me this was the best one yet! Thanks for a great recipe. Easy cheap healthy and delicious.",

It really only needed about 2 Tbsp of sesame oil. I also reduced the salt. I'd add some soy sauce in the end to pump up the flavor a bit. Thank you for the recipe.",
