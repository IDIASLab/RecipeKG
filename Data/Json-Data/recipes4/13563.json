I made the changes because I didn't have all the exact ingredients. I used top sirloin steaks instead of the flank steak. I didn't have jalepenos or pickled carrots so I substituted sliced mushrooms for those. Also I used canned artichoke hearts instead of marinated. I cooked the entire recipe on the stove top at low heat for health reasons. I added a little chopped garlic on top of the steaks (from a jar). With all these changes the result was gourmet delicious. My husband and son and I enjoyed it immensely. The horseradish really made the taste scrumptious. Thanks Jeff for a great idea. We will definitely make this again.",

I call it my pantry recipe because everything was on hand with a short walk to my personal \"store\". I used beef stock instead of cubes and canned artichoke hearts instead of marinated a half can of green chili's instead of pickled jalapeno's because that's what I had on hand. I used 2 chuck steaks that I wanted to used up because I left them in the freezer too long I'm sure we have all done that from time to time! So I was looking for a dish with a host of strong flavors to compensate for any loss of flavor to the meat and this really fit the bill. Other than those minor changes I made this just like the author presented. My husband loves horseradish and the aroma comng from the oven was driving him crazy before it was served. After it was served we agreed this would go into my book of favorite recipes. Thanks so much for offering it.",

I also used canned artichoke hears and canned jalapeno peppers since that is what I had on hand. I was super excited to try this recipe as I was trying to find something to make with the beef I had and the ingredients in my pantry that was different than the old stand by stroganoff or beef stew. While this was easy to make I found it quiet sour and the boiled beef eh. I am not sure the pickeled carrots would have improved the flavor as the sourness from the capers and the artichokes was in of themselves strong. I like that most of the time but I did pair this with some green beans cooked with bacon and onions and that seems to help...maybe add some bacon??? I may make again but not likely.",
