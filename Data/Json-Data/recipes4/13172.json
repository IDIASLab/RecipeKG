If you want a sauce to go with this recipe, try this; saute 1/2 thinly sliced shallot, 1/2 tsp lemon or orange zest in 4 tbsp butter until shallots are crisp tender.  Add 2 cups champagne, simmer until reduced by half.  Strain the sauce through cheesecloth, return liquid to the still hot pan.  (Keep the skillet on the hot burner, but do not turn the burner back on!) Wisk in 3 tbsp cold butter, cut into small pieces, adding more butter only after the last is fully incorporated.  Drizzle evenly over cooked tails, serve immediately.",
