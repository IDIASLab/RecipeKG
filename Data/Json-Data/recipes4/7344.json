We used 4 asparagus spears wrapped with 1 slice bacon and still had 3 slices bacon left. My daughter helped put this together and she was skimpy with the siracha sauce but didn't need to as the bacon really mellows out the hotness of the sauce. Only had one person out of 19 that complained of the hotness. I like hot spicy foods so next time I make this I will be generous with the siracha which really does not make it hot due to the bacon, just adds so much awesome flavor (in my opinion). Only had 1 left so almost everyone loved it!\nThank you for sharing this recipe!",
