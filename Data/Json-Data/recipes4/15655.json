I made this a couple times first time by the receipt - it was good but way to sweet. So the second time I switched out the water with unsweetened almond milk and a 1/3 cup of agave - smoother creamier taste - still way to sweet There will be a next time and I'm keeping my other modifications and doing just a 1/4 cup of agave. I would think that it his would be a difficulty pleasure.... but I don't! Keeper quick dessert! Thanks!",
