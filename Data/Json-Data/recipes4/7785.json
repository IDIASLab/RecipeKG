                "reviewBody": "This turned out really good. I used leftover grilled chicken breast which gave the overall flavor an extra boost. I also think baby corn and bamboo shoots straight out of the can have a metallic taste so I put them in a bowl together and drizzled some sesame seed oil over them about 30 minutes prior to putting them on the pizza. I do think chopped water chestnuts would have been a better choice over the bamboo shoots buy maybe I just prefer that added texture they give. I'm thinking coarsely chopped roasted peanuts and diced jalapeno's would make a nice topping too. This was a nice change from everyday ordinary pizza and I would most definitely make it again.",
