I had brussel sprouts that I wanted to use and changed the rest of the vegetables. I used sliced carrots and sliced red peppers. I also sauteed the brussel sprouts and carrots, since they are harder in texture in a bit of olive oil and garlic first - and then continued with the recipe, adding vegetable broth (instead of water and bouillion). I like a lot of sauce, so I increased the liquid amount to 1 1/2 cups and I think this actually results in a good generous serving for 2 - instead of 4. I didn't have tarragon - substituted sage. Also added white pepper to the liquid mix. I also had whipped cream cheese on hand instead of sour cream, so I used that. My teenaged daughter cleaned her plate and I'm enjoying the final bites of mine right now!Just had to write right away since the reviews seemed so so and this was not my experience. I think the outcome would be very similar even if you used all of the ingredients in the recipe, except for the quantity of the sauce. ",

I measured all the spices as indicated used chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water (but just eyeballed the amounts) added a splash each of olive oil and white wine used 3 good dollops of sour cream instead of measuring it out from my large container and put a few pinches of shredded parm right into the pan at the end (instead of topping it once plated). I used the veggies I had on hand: fresh onion and carrot frozen brussels sprouts broccoli (maybe 1/2c each though I didn't measure) and green beans (maybe 1/4c) and jarred roasted red peppers and artichokes (probably 2tbs each). I served it over rigatoni because that's what was in the cabinet. Delicious!",
