I cooked it on my gas stove over low heat so the onions wouldn't burn. I also mixed it with a hand blender rather than puree in a regular blender. I love using my Braun hand blender. Everyone liked it and it had great flavor. I left out the soy sauce and used a little extra white pepper. The tips were like little bonuses in the soup. Highly recommend it!",

I made a few minor changes as follows: I used skim milk for the milk called for in the recipe. 1 medium onion chopped (instead of 1-1/2 cups) 4 Tbs. butter (rather than 6) and I replaced the 2 cups of water with 1 can of chicken broth plus 2 oz. water. Also I only used 1 Tbs soy sauce. As another had suggested I used my Braun hand blender directly in the pan which saved some time and clean-up. I heated the skim milk in the microwave and found the recipe came together quicker than expected. Thanks Holly for a an excellent recipe!",

I also didn't puree the veggies just mashed them preferring a more substantial soup. One very good addition was using about 1/3 c. sour cream and mixing it in a small bowl with 1 cup of the hot soup mixture at the end of the cooking. Be sure to mix it in verrrry slowly or the sour cream will curdle. Once it is thoroughly mixed together add it to the soup pot - this will make for a very creamy soup!",

Second, I reduced the amount of tamari (by necessity I used soy sauce) to only one-third the amount called for - again, good call.  Third, the soup calls for water and I'm not sure why - it contributes no flavor and only dilutes what flavor there is.  I used chicken broth instead.  Finally, I would have much preferred the soup pureed completely.  The chunky tips almost seemed as tho' they didn't belong and added a little bitterness as well.",
