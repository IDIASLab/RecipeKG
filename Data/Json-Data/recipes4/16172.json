For a vegan version, omit the eggs, and use almond milk in place of the dairy and replace butter with vegan buttery sticks. Both versions are quite delicious! Just make sure to let the pudding cool to room temperature to let pudding set and then place in refrigerator to chill for at least 3 hours. Enjoy!",

I reduced nutmeg to half a teaspoon and the spices were perfect for me, but I like my recipes a bit heavy on cinnamon, but it does overpower the coconut taste a bit.  I slowly added one cup of the hot rice mixture to the eggs, and then added the eggs/rice mix back into the main dish.  I will make this again. Thanks",

I wasn't sure how I would like the cinnamon on the pudding (can't stand the taste of nutmeg so that was a no brainer to leave it out lol) so instead I left it out and exchanged the vanilla for half coconut extract and half rum extract. Once it started to cool down I added some very well drained crushed pineapple to the pudding. It was like a Pina Colada flavor. Would for sure make it that way again!",

I didn't have whole milk (or cream) so I left out the sugar and added a can of sweetened condensed milk at the beginning and probably about 1/2 c. of 1% milk at the end of the cooking time. I also added a little bit more coconut milk but not much and some chopped Pink Lady apples. I didn't try it but I'd be willing to bet that some chopped cinnamon and sugar almonds would make an amazing addition as well.",

Others have said they cut the sugar in half, but I thought maybe that was overkill, so I cut down to 1c, which is cutting by 1/3.  And that was 3/4 cup turbinado sugar with 1/4c white sugar, because I thought I might not care for all turbinado.  It's borderline too sweet, so next time I make it I'll indeed cut back to 3/4c.  Also, a quarter-cup of butter seemed like a lot, so I used only 3T and it tastes fine.\n   For the spices I went with only 1T cinnamon and 1t nutmeg, and that was plenty for my taste.\n   To me, rice pudding HAS to have raisins, but I didn't want to just add them at the end like the recipe says, which wouldn't give them much time to plump up, so I added them when there were 5 minutes left of the 18-20 minute boiling period.  That gave them that 5 minutes, plus the 2 minutes after adding the milk & eggs, plus the time for the pudding to cool down, and that seemed to be about right.",
