I modified it a bit because I didn't have canned tomatoes or paste- I used a jar of spaghetti sauce and it worked well. I also used about a cup and a half of mozzarella instead of the parm inbetween layers. I used almost 2 whole eggplants and 2lb of ground beef. Thank you for the inspiration I hope others love it too!",

I made a very simplified version of this recipe. The tomato etc that gets mixed with the ground beef sounded like spaghetti sauce to me so I just used Mids (A.K.A. \"the best\") jarred sauce. Like some other reviewers I skipped the onion layer. Assembly took 10 minutes! Cook time was just a little less than a Disney video on a rainy day. Thank you Thank you Thank you allrecipes.com_______ Too funny. It is 4 years later and I just came across this review from one of my first uses of this website. Guess what? My kids still ASK for this dish about once a month.",

We love eggplant so to start with I cut the slices thicker at 1/4 inch they bake to mush mine were 1/2 inch or a bit more. I also used my own marinara sauce and used a mix of ground beef and sweet Italian sausage. I skipped the onion slices in between the layers completely they serve no real purpose and add nothing to the casserole. I used bread crumbs on top mixed with a hefty amount of good grated parmesan in between the layers I added a nice layer of mozzarella and provolone cheese and no bread crumbs. I baked this for 45 minutes covered at 350 then uncovered for 20 at 400. 80-90 minutes in the oven as the recipe calls for is too long. It is unnecessary to salt and allow eggplant to sit to get rid of the bitter especially when using a cooking method such as this.",
