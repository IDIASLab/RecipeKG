If you do not like the flavor of Wendys chili do not make this recipe thinking it's going to be different.  And please do not offer your comments and rating.  I rated this recipe based on the fact that I love Wendys chili and how close does this chili come to that flavor.  Very close and the flavor perfect.... Is it Wendys? NO, you only get Wendys chili at Wendys!  Is it a good rendition.. Oh yes..... And it's even better on day 2!!!!  If you choose to review a recipe make sure you made the recipe as posted.  Do not review a recipe if you changed it all up and then don't like.  A less than 4 or 5 star review of a changed up recipe is a review of ones own poor cooking skills.  Be real!!!",

Perfect for my busy-wife-and-mommy life!  Great for the slow cooker - I browned the ground beef for about 8 or so minutes on the stove and dumped everything into the pot w/out saut\u00e9ing anything else - super easy!  Freezes perfectly, tastes even better the next day, feeds a crowd for company and potlucks.  The only thing I'd suggest is to rinse your beans.  The frothy stuff you see when rinsing is what causes the \"musical\" part to your postprandial experience so rinsing definitely cuts that down if it's ever been a concern for you.  My husband likes his spicy so he will be adding more chili powder and cumin to his helping; if you like spicier chili you will need to do the same as the way it is written here gives you a mild, ever-so-slight kick.  Or, when you purchase the chili seasonings packets, pick \"medium\" or \"hot\" (I chose the 30% less sodium, mild spice option).  Love that it's also way more economical than running to the local food chain when I have a hankerin' for some of that famous chili =)",
