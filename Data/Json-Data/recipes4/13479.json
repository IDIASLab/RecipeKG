I used regular strawberry jello (not sugar free) which may have made it a bit stickier than if the directions were followed. If you take this route avoid using glass as it will glue itself to the plate. I let it set in a 9 by 9 Tupperware then cut it into strips. Be sure to have a SUPER sharp knife for this process. Normal steak knives will only make you frustrated which also makes me think cookie cutters won't work either. The family votes that the thinner strips were the best the thick ones did come off as rubbery. It was easier to work with while cold also if you have a big batch only take out what you are working with or it becomes difficult. The taste was perfect and the thin strips were as enjoyable as any store bought candy (if not more so!). FYI this recipe does not have chemicals like store bought candies it will need to be kept in the fridge or eaten in short order. If you do it right it wont be around long anyhow!",

Too sweet or sour or something. It seriously does look very pretty. My friend and I used rubber flower and heart molds... maybe I will post a picture of our pretty creation. Thanks for the recipe any way. They are edible and like I said they are just soooo cute. And being the only gummy candy recipe on this site. Make them maybe use 1 1/2 packs of jell-o and six packs of the un- flavored stuff. Thank you very much for posting it! By the way... I'm 11 and my friend is 12.",
