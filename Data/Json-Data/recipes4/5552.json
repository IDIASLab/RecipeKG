I was too lazy to measure the saltines - I guestimated and used one package of saltines (4 0z) roughly crumbled with my hands.  Blending in onion and bell pepper along with eggs etc... is brillant!  Mixing it all together with your hands assures that it isn't over worked yet well mixed.  Then, by free forming rather than cooking in a loaf pan allows the water in the meat loaf to evaporate, leaving a crispy exterior.  Thanks for featuring this recipe, it is a keeper for sure.",

Even though I don't dislike meatloaf, I never cared for it enough to learn to make it.  My first few attempts were-- well-- not good.  When I saw this recipe, it seemed like it would hit the mark.  After all, how could a grandma named Coco be wrong?  It did hit the mark!  My husband LOVED it.  He even commented, \"This will make kickin' sandwiches tomorrow!\" He said Coco definitely knew what she was doing.  I even had a second helping. :)  The texture is spot-on which can make or break a meatloaf in my opinion. The blending of the veggies was a genius idea and actually made prep faster because I didn't have to spend extra time carefully chopping. (I admit that I did throw a couple of garlic cloves in the blender.) Thanks Coco and Steve!",

I actually prefer to find bits of veggies because I think they give more flavor than the \"pasteurized\" version. Mom's version of meatloaf includes bread crumbs but the cracker crumbs made this a very tender loaf. I cooked for the full hour and let rest for 15 minutes. I will make again but I will add more mustard and some ground black pepper.",

I didnt have dry mustard so I added a teaspoon of table mustard and from reading other meatloaf recipes I added 1/4 cup brown sugar to the meat. For the topping I put ketchup on half and barbecue on the other. Both sides turned out delicious but the barbecue gave it a little more of a kick. I do recommend trying! Also I had to cook for 50 mins instead of 45 mins and to add to one reviewer one whole sleeve of saltine crackers is 2 cups. My kids absolutely loved it and my husband couldnt get enough! I will definitely be making this one again!! Thank you Steve for posting!",
