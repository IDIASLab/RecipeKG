In my opinion, the wine sauce should be reduced down about 1/2 way before adding the cream/flour mixture.  I added 1c heavy cream and 1c sour cream since I didn't have half n half.  I also used left over steak from the weekend and chopped it up in 1\" chunks.  Since it was already cooked, I just threw everything in the onion mixture together.  I omitted  the mushrooms because my hubby hates them.  I added peas, 1TBS of worscheshire sauce and a tad of crushed red pepper to give it another dimension.  This was a good recipe.  I'm not one that can just throw things together, though once I have an idea I never stick to the recipe.  So, thanks for the wonderful idea.  It made leftovers.  :)",
