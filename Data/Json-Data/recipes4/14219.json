I served topped with freshly grated parm cheese and crusty bread. So simple and delicious! Thanks",

I used three different types of canned beans and added a tabelspoon of dried dill to make it interesting. I did have to add a good amount of salt - since everything I used was no salt added! The only part I cooked on the stove - was I sauteed 2 red onions and 2 medium hot peppers in grapeseed oil butter salt and 2 tablespoons of sugar to almost caramelize them - then added them to the crockpot. Cooked on low for 5 hours - WONDERFUL - the slight warmth from the peppers was perfect for this 23 degree night we are supposed to have! Thanks! Will use again and again - the crockpot - made this soooo easy!!!!!",

I don't know how to make a recipe without \"doctoring\" it up so I made a few changes because I can't help myself. I only added maybe 3/4 cup of fresh diced tomatoes because I had them on hand from making pizza. I used organic \"Better than Boullion\" instead of cubes because it has a deeper flavor than cubes. While sauteeing the onions and garlic I also cubed and added a small smoked ham steak (figured it would be a good additive). It gave the soup a richer flavor - I am glad I did that. With some fresh garlic toast it was definitely a hit in my house. I will definitely make it again - if I don't my family may hurt me.",
