I couldn't help myself-I added an egg to the 2 ingredients to help bind it together.  I frosted them with a canned cream cheese frosting. The cookies were well received by 12 kids and their moms, earning me high praises.  Thanks Tonia for making me look so good, so easily.  It was like eating the tops of a cupcake-the very best part!  I sprayed the pans with Pam, and the cookies didn't stick.  Mine were not gooey as some described, but I bet theirs just needed a little longer in the oven. (all ovens are different) This recipe is delicious, kid friendly, and easy to prepare and that makes it a winner (and a recipe you hand out to others)!",

I also baked the cookies on parchment paper sprayed with nonstick spray, flattened them slightly before baking with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar, and took them out at exactly nine minutes.  I don't know how they tast cold, because I've eaten several straight out of the oven, and they are terrific!",

You absolutely have to use cream cheese icing though because they aren't sweet enough on their own. I used these for a preschool thanksgiving party and they were a kit with parents and kids!

The next batch I made a little smaller and cooked for 15 minutes. They were done and my kids did like them so that was good. Just be warned...do the toothpick test on them before you take them out of the oven. Also don't expect them to flatten out while baking.
