        "description": "This is an alteration of Beef Wellington. I don't care for the traditional pate and mushrooms, so I looked for an alternative to put between the meat and pastry. This is what I wound up with. This is heavy and filling, so I generally try to pair it with some light sides like grilled vegetables or a salad.  It works wonderfully well with venison tenderloin instead of beef as well! I also discovered (the hard way) when rolling out puff pastry dough on waxed paper, that it is best to spray the waxed paper with nonstick spray first. Otherwise, it tends to be difficult to get back off.",
