I made this several times experimenting with the seasonings and made it again for our labor day cookout using Italian seasoning in place of the basil and thyme. Everyone raved over it. I tripled the marinade recipe for 6 chicken breasts putting the breasts in one bag with 1/3rd of the marinade. I nuked the potatoes for a few minutes in the micro because I found on other occasions that everything else was ready and the potato'e were still not cooked. That solved that problem. I added broccoli and fresh mushrooms to the vegetable mixture and put them all in another large plastic bag with a third of the marinade. I let everything marinate for 3-4 hrs then placed all in a large aluminun foil container poured the last of the marinade over all sprinkled with parmesean cheese covered and put it in the fridge until it was time to put it on the grill. 35 min. grilling time was perfect chicken was done and the veggies were still crisp tender.",

After reading the other reviews, I did make a minor change. Instead of putting the chicken breast right onto the foil, I first dipped it in the mixture, stabbing it a few times with a fork to get the flavoring inside the chicken as well. This worked out WONDERFULLY well, creating a flavorful and moist chicken. This is definately something that will be made again and again. I can't wait to share it with friends.",

After reading tons of reviews here's what i did: I used red wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar because thats all I had and I used Italian seasoning instead of the basil and thyme. I poked some holes in the chicken and soaked it in the marinade as another person suggested (I can't imagine making this without doing this) I also put the potatoes in the microwave for a couple minutes as someone else suggested.  The potatoes still didn't cook all the way and the veggies were way overcooked...but the chicken turned out GREAT! So next time I think i'll cook the potatoes in a seperate foil pack; making sure they cook all the way. And i'll add the veggies halfway through cooking the chicken.",

I used a bottled garlic & herb marinade instead of the suggested oil vinegar spices to marinate the chicken 2. I substituted chicken breasts for 2 chicken drumsticks (skin removed) 3. I chose fresh yellow summer squash zucchini small red potatoes sweet vidalia onions yellow and red bell peppers 4. I spooned a little of the marinade over the top of the chicken/veggies then seasoned with garlic salt freshly ground pepper and topped with fresh basil 5. I double wrapped each packet in heavy duty foil to keep all the juices in 6. Grilled the packets for 40 mins turning often Chicken and veggies were cooked perfectly and delicious!",

I increased the spices as others suggested but that only benefited the vegetables. If I try this recipe again I will ladle some sauce on the meat then add the vegetables and ladle on some more sauce. The vegetables were very good but the chicken was very plain and for some reason dry. I don't know what I did wrong but the chicken was not as moist as I expected it to be. I left them on the full 40 minutes because the chicken breasts were kind of thick. Must have been too long but the potatoes were just done and some weren't thoroughly cooked. However I do think the recipe has potential and that's why I gave it three stars.",
