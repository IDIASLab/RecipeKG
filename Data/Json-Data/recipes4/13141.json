You can purchase pre-made chicharron at specialty markets, however this recipe tastes just like it.

I do think these would be perfectly fine as written but I made a few minor changes due to who I was making them for. Our good friends are from El Salvador and are very particular about the roja and curtido.  After comparing her recipe to this one, I left out all of the green for the roja. The minor change with the curtido is that I used white onion instead of green which was her request. For the filling I ended up adding more cheese to get the texture I was going for. These turned out really good. They had never had them with bacon before and they enjoyed them. She did suggest I add some beans to the filling next time so I'll put that out there. The hardest part of making pupusas for me is stuffing and then forming them. I had her here for help and she did it like a pro. After watching her I realized that in the past I try to flatten them too much. She left them large and fluffy so that they were easier to shape. I definitely recommend making the roja and curtido ahead of time like I did so that the flavors have a chance to get acquainted. I also recommend buying the already shredded cabbage and carrot in a bag to save some time. If you have never made pupusas you are missing out!",
