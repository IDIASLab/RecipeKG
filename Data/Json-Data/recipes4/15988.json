I used the juice of the canned pineapple in place of the water, and whole eggs instead of just whites. Finally, I added a block of cream cheese and some confectioners sugar to the pineapple/cool whip/pudding mixture.   The end result: my husband declared this to be the best dessert I have ever made him.  Thanks for making me a kitchen hero!",
