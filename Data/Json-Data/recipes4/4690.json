I changed the recipe a bit, in addition to the 6 split croissants I add 2 or 3 more, which I tore completely into little pieces .  I layered as directed, but  added steamed asparagus, only used shredded Swiss and mozzarella cheese, which I didn't measure, but it was at least a total of 3 cups cheese. I increased the smoked salmon to a full  pound.  I used 14 eggs and 3 extra egg whites, 1 cup whole cream, then decided that I should put about 1/2 cup milk to egg batter.   I topped it all with the 6 croissant tops I reserved, and let sit over night in the fridge.  Next morning I let sit on counter for an hour to bring closer to room temp. I am only citing the changes I made, all other ingredients stayed the same, except I omitted any added salt.   As others suggested, I reduced cook time to 35 min at 400 degrees Fahrenheit.  Oh my goodness!! It was delish!  Everyone raved and had more than one serving . There was very little left over.   We called it smoked salmon souffl\u00e9 because it was so light, yet rich!  I'll have to seriously stick to my diet for a long time to make up for it, but it was so worth it!",
