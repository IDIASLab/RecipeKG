I seasoned the roast generously with Spike and garlic pepper before searing, and also placed the sweet potatoes on top of the roast instead of underneath (the onions and garlic were kept on the bottom of the crock, though). I made slits and shoved in some garlic cloves, crocked it for 8 hours on low, and it was absolutely perfect:  a handsome, falling apart, no-knife needed roast. The sweet pototoes also came out the right consistency. This will be one of my new favorites.",

The sweet potatoes\r\nwere very tender, NOT mushy and tasted wonderful.\r\n\r\nI had leftovers and when reheated in the saved broth in a saucepan was just as good as the first day it was made. I put the leftover meat in a low oven wraped in foil for a short time and it was still mosit and tender.  My husband loved this and said he definitely wants this as a \"make again\" recipe.  One hint,  if you open the lid even just one time before the minimum cooking time, you loose 1 to 1/2 hrs. of cooking time, which means you have to add that additional loss of time to your expected time done.",

I trimmed all the fat off the roast and seasoned it with seasoned salt and garlic pepper prior to searing. I sliced one clove of garlic and placed the slivers in slits cut in the roast.  Since I knew I would be gone for 9 hours instead of 6, I cut the sweet potatoes into large chunks and put them on top of the roast (I used 2 large onions and the garlic to line the crock pot).  The potatoes were slighty soft, but not mushy.  The flavor of the whole dish was superb.  My mom and husband both agreed that this was a keeper!",

The posting above was made a few years ago, and I've made this several times since, but I thought I'd change it up a little this time.  I've always added more garlic than called for, but this last time I seared the pork roast as I usually do, then I added about a 1/2 can of chicken broth to the drippings, let it come to a simmer to loosen up the bits stuck to the pan, then poured it into the crockpot along with the rest of the broth...that small step took this recipe to another level!!  This is really the only way I cook pork roast.  Thank you so much for this posting.",

I left out the sweet potatoes because I just wanted plain mashed potatoes that I could pour gravy over. I seared the pork with my seasonings of choice garlic Fiesta Fajita seasoning and salt-free Cavender's Greek Seasoning. I saved the 'drippings' from the searing to make my gravy rue then added the broth from the cooked roast to finish it up. I cooked the roast on two onions cut in half for 5 1/2 hours and just cut the cooker off to let it 'rest' for the last 30 minutes while I was finishing up the remainder of the meal. I haven't eaten until I was 'stuffed' in a long time but I certainly did last night and so did my husband!",

Take a hot sauce pan and heat up your spices a bit (do not burn) this should be about 2 min or so and then rub onto the roast.  Then I added the rest in the recipe.  I cooked it at 4 hours high (starting at 7:30am) then at lunch I put it at 6 hours high.  Them meat fell right off the bone!  It was so tender and flavorful I shredded it up and heated up some corn tortillas (Milagro are the best tortillas) salsa and cheese.  Very good!  The spices are what I use when making empanada meat.",
