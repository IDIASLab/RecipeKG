Many white cheeses will work in this dish my preference is any italian cheese blend but I've used colby-jack w/great tasting results too. Added half a chopped onion before baking because the onion really complements the sugar in the honey. If you fear too strong of a mustard flavor or don't have enough mustard then lessen the amount of mustards called for and replace the lessened amount with mayonnaise... Two examples: #1 I did not have spicy brown so I used 1/4 cup mayo to replace the spicy brown - chicken came out great. #2 I did not have enough mustards so I used slightly more than 1/8th cup of each mustard with slightly less then 1/2 cup of mayo to make up for the loss of mustard",

I was skeptical that this could be good (too few ingredients and too much mustard and honey were my thoughts.) I was so wrong; it smells wonderful and tastes great. My tween son liked it too and he doesn't eat mustard voluntarily. The only thing I wasn't please with was that the cheese melted out of the chicken and into the baking dish but I was able to scoop it up and put it on top of the plated chicken. I would make this again. And thanks to recipe submitter gill1980. Also thanks to Recipe Group for choosing a recipe that I never would have; it was fun to participate and I look forward to future recipes.",

I pulled a package of boneless chicken breast out of the freezer and when they thawed they were bone-in. Luckily they were thick enough that I just worked around the bone. I used all the ingredients only my cheese was fresh mozzarella discs. I wrapped the cheese inside of ham slices. This worked out nicely as the cheese stayed contained. It did make ALOT of sauce. I poured half of the sauce on the chicken and baked 25 minutes with foil on and 25 minutes with foil off. I heated the rest of the sauce on the stovetop and added additional sauce as I was serving. We enjoyed this and I will make again using boneless chicken breast but will use the fresh mozzarella as it worked great in this recipe. We heated the leftovers in the toaster oven tonight and they were as good as the night I made them.",
