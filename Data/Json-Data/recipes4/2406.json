I also fried the veggies (used a whole package of baby portabella mushrooms, 2 green peppers and a vidalia onion) just until tender crisp and added them the last hour of cooking in the crock pot so they didn't get soggy.  I used minced garlic vs. garlic powder, definitely add the red wine, added a couple of Tbsp. of low sodium soy sauce along with the worcestershire, and 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes. The horseradish and mustard combo is good, but would be more suited to roast beef or ham sandwiches.  We used a garlic mayo (1/2 c. mayo with a couple tsp. of minced garlic or to taste).  We opted for swiss cheese and put our hoagie rolls under the broiler to get them toasty and to melt the cheese then added the very well drained meat and veggies - we hate soggy sandwiches....... If we go for more of a cheesesteak version we'll opt for some melted velveeta as this does make a lot of leftovers!",

Didn't use a slow cooker and just simmered everything in a large pot on top of the stove for about 1/2 hour. Doubled the garlic powder and crushed red pepper. Only used 1/4 tsp. salt. Be careful of the horseradish/mustard mixture though. I only made 75 per-cent of what was written and I have about 1/2 left! This was truly a GREAT sandwich that I will make often.",

I didn't use the mustard on the sandwich bread, and I made up individual sandwiches in hoagie buns, then heated them in the oven to melt the cheese, and it was a huge success! This is delicious, and a bit like a cross between a cheese steak sandwich and a french dip. I also used a lot of extra mushrooms since my husband and I love them, and this is one recipe I will be making over and over again! The leftover liquid from cooking used for dipping is so tasty, we loved it! Thanks!",

I like horserasdish and brown mustard and I did cut down amt of each to 1/4 c (should have plenty if use 3 Tbsp each) but taste does not go well with this recipe in my opinion...also made bread a little soggy. Wine added some flavor but not necessary for recipe to turn out well. I also put steak in freezer for about an hour and was much easier to get thin slices. Will make again but only butter and toast the bread.",

The only thing I did different was used hoagie roles that I brushed with evoo infused with garlic.  Popped into hot oven for about 3 to 5 minutes until lightly browned then added cheese till melted.  Take out of oven and add steak and veggies from crockpot.  Did not use the horseradish and each person added their own dijon mustard to their liking.  Yummy Yummy Yummy.  Thanks for the great post.",

I read the reviews and omitted the horseradish and mustard although I usually like both - I'm glad I did as I think it would have completely overwhelmed the taste.  I used \"Garlic Butter\" from this site instead, which was great.  The sauce was wonderful, I would dip other sandwiches in it as well when I'm done with the leftovers!  ;)  I made it as written but added a touch more worcestershire.  I also misunderstood \"sliced thinly\" - I think it means shaved but I cut thin strips of sirloin.  That ended up being great but I had to cook on high for 5-6 hours to make it tender.  I definitely recommend the slow cooker to make the meat the right texture.  Be sure to drain well as other reviews recommended to avoid sogginess.  Delicious, I will make it again, frequently!!!",

The cooking liquid made a wonderful au jus for dipping. The only change I made was to use fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. Since the price of sirloin has sky-rocketed here I think next time I may use a cheaper cut of meat. I don't think it would make much difference since the meat is slow cooked anyway. Wonderful recipe.
