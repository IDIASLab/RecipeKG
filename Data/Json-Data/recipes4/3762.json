I have also Overnighted this salad to a friend in Dallas who simply loves it.  Of course, I pack it in dry ice.  It's fast, simple and great for a cocktail party on party rye, on toast or a bagel for breakfast, on rye with lettuce, thinly sliced onions and dill (or sweet)pickles and mayo for lunch or with pea soup and sandwich for dinner.  It's down right Yummy!!!  And make no changes to the ingredients because the salad will not taste the same.",

Just wanted to mention, if there is any left over it is great mixed with a little Italian flavored bread crumbs and stuffed in mushrooms then baked for 1/2 hour at 325 for an appetizer.  You might even add some grated Parmesan to the top just before removing from the oven.   A friend has made this salad with left over roast pork and it is also very tasty.  I grind almost everything left over and give it a try.  I had two left over Chicken Cordon Blue's the other day, ground them up and made chicken salad and it was awesome.  The combination of the cheese and the ham made it delicious.   Thanks again for the reviews.  Happy days and happy grinding. :o]  Winter Blossom ",

I don't know about serving twelve...my three boys asked for second sandwiches and I spread some on Toppers crackers. Aside from a little leftover, it's gone gone gone. I'll make this again!",

But I made a glazed ham the other night and needed something different to try with the leftovers. I'm eating this right now and it's just glorious. I didn't have any relish so I threw in pickle slices in my processor after chopping the ham and it worked out just great. Excellent recipe!",

As the submitter said it's a good idea to add a little more mayo to the mixture right before you eat it to get the texture just right. I made more of this than I meant to last time so I've been a little creative in adding ingredients along with the extra mayo: I substituted Miracle Whip once have added some hot sauce a few times and some chopped jalapenos also all were very good and gave the salad some nice variations. I purchased a \"ham end\" at the deli today (last time I made it with ham steaks) so I'll give that a try.:) Thank you for the great recipe.",

Very good but a little bland for my New Orleans taste buds. So loving all things garlic I added a sprinkle (1/2 tsp) of garlic salt and white pepper. It brought the flavors together beautifully! I also have to say that I used light sour cream instead of mayo. A caterer friend taught me that trick years ago...anytime you want it to last longer and not taste like mayo use sour cream.

The first time I didn't have enough dill pickle relish so I added enough Wickle's brand relish to make the 1/3 cup called for in the recipe. (Wickle's is a sweet spicy bread and butter type pickle). The second time I used all dill pickle relish. I think I preferred the one with a bit of Wickle's in it to the one with all dill pickle relish. Both times I used dijon mustard instead of brown mustard just a personal preference. Without a doubt this is the BEST ham salad I have ever had. I had ham for Christmas this year just so I would have leftover ham to make this recipe... it is that good!!!",
