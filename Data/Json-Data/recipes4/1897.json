The reason behind this is I feel it is lacking something but couldn't place it. Everyone else said it was excellent and better than any kind of nacho dip they had before. The only problems I ran into was that first the velvetta cheese was VERY thick and needed to be melted quickly (please take into account if this is your first time making this the cheese will initially need about an hour or so to melt where you can mix everything else into it) I wound up throwing my crock pot ceramic into the microwave for a few minutes to melt the cheese. After I got everything mixed together make sure you watch that crock pot!! I found out that \"low\" on my crockpot was boiling the cheese on the edge scalding it. I then had to constantly turn the pot on and off and on and off. I am not sure if this is just how my crockpot is or not but just be forewarned. Another hint I suggest is have everyone scoop their own from the crockpot with plastic spoons because if you reuse the same spoon the cheese cools and hardens and looks kind of gross and turns people away from scooping it on their plate. Other than that great recipe and I will be making it again this time with a crockpot liner because dried baked cheese it not fun to clean.",

Since I was making the dip for a crowd of almost 20 I had to double it--and instead of having 2 lbs of sausage, I used 1 lb. of spicy sausage and 1 lb. ground beef.  Instead of just diced green chile peppers I used the Rotel diced tomatos with green chiles.  Also, the dip was a little thick for my tastes, so I used some whole milk to give the dip a creamier texture.  Yumm Yumm!",

I found this recipe when I was looking for a Queso dip recipe to make for a Halloween Party and thought it sounded pretty good. I followed the directions and measurements; however I did add about a 1/2 cup of 2% milk to make it less thick and I used a can of the Rotel tomatos and diced green-chiles instead of using just chiles. I also noticed some people commented on having difficulties in melting the cheese; either that it took too long or burned to the sides of the crock-pot. I poured a little of my milk in first then put all the cheese in on top (I cute mine into REALLY small pieces). I turned the crock-pot on to low to gradually warm it then turned it to warm then to high. I stirred the cheese pretty frequently while it was melting and continually added a few drops of milk to keep it from getting too thick. After it almost completely melted I turned the crock-pot back to low. It did not specify on a type of sausage other than spicy so I used chorizo which I think gave it extra flavor. I will definitely make this again. I may even try adding onions black beans or extra meat next time.",
