I used one Russet baking potato which I microwaved. I only had some leftover french onion dip (a mixture of sour cream and onion soup mix) which I used in place of the sour cream. I layered half the potato which was cut in hunks into the bottom of a small Pyrex baking dish spread on some dip covered with a little of both types of cheeses sprinkled with chopped cooked bacon and sprinkled with salt and pepper. Then repeated those layers. I baked at the recommended temperature and time. Chopped green onion went on top after baking. This was very good and a different way to eat a baked potato and the toppings that I would normally eat with it. Thanks!",

I was having a large group of people for dinner and bought enough ingredients to make two pans of these potatoes. As I started putting the dishes together I found that 1 1/2 pounds of potatoes per pan was no where near enough. I used 3 pounds of potatoes and the quantities of the other ingredients for just one dish. The amount of bacon sour cream and cheese for 3 pounds of potatoes was plenty and would seem that these amounts would be way too much for just 1 1/2 pounds. I fed 15 people and still had some leftover.",
