The best thing about this recipe is it can be served by itself for a main dish on Mexican night, or be eaten with tortilla chips as a dip or even rolled up in a tortilla as a taco, burrito, or enchilada. Garnish with green onions, avocado, tomatoes, or/and sour cream. Very versatile recipe. So enjoy and learn the many uses of oh so healthy quinoa.",

I found the casserole \"guts\" to be bland, so added extra recipe spices of chili powder, cumin, salt and then added a little Aleppo pepper, cayenne pepper and paprika.  I also added 8 ounces of chorizo chicken sausage.  It took me about 3 hours to put everything together with all the prep.  I'm always slow the first time I make any recipe, and making everything (but the tomato paste in the enchilada sauce) takes time.  The end result was worth the effort and the two of us will have leftovers we'll enjoy all week.",

I subbed pinto beans for the black (what I had in the pantry) and after the realization that I didn't have the enchilada sauce I thought I did I used plain tomato sauce mixed with some hot sauce for the topping. I utilized my rice cooker to cook the quinoa while I saut\u00e9ed the veggies and it all came together quickly and easily. I left the cilantro out since my husband doesn't like it and just put fresh on mine. We put this in whole wheat tortillas and it was a great weeknight dinner.
