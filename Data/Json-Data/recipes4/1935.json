Seasoning the outside with salt and pepper was something I\u2019ve never done before either.  As Hubs put it, this was a wonderful treatment of a baked potato.  If you\u2019re thinking it spices it up, it doesn\u2019t.  But it makes the peel of the potato deliciously flavorful and even kind of crispy.  Don\u2019t wrap your potatoes in foil before baking.  And DO rub them with oil as in this recipe.  A medium-sized potato (I pricked it with a fork a few times) was perfectly baked in one hour at 375 degrees.  A baked potato never tasted so good.",

These are delicious - \"crispy on the outside and soft on the inside\". I didn't bother with the whole \"bag thing\" I just used my fingers to rub the potatoes with oil and used garlic powder and a bit of kosher salt. I pierced the potatoes a couple of times with a fork and wrapped them in foil - you really don't want a mess in your oven. These were soooo good -all that was needed was a little butter, salt, & pepper. Great classic recipe!",

I still felt the inside needed a little butter but the potato was nice and soft. I think if I were to do these again I would try maybe doing as directed but them wrapping in foil. Then when the potatoes are done you could unwrap cut in half and drizzle any remaining olive oil and seasonings left over in the foil packet over the top. Yum! Great starting point for flavorful baked potatoes though!",

I baked my potatoes a little slower at 300 degrees for two hours or so. I didn t measure anything. I just oiled the potatoes and then sprinkled the seasonings on to my preference. They turned out very well. We topped them with butter sour cream and pepper. There was nothing left on our plates and my husband usually isn t a potato skin eater.
