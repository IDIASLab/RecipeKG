If you sub biscuits with bread dough garlic powder for fresh thyme for rosemary and bake it in a loaf pan you have just created a NEW recipe! Whew. With that being said this is a terrific little go-to when you don't want to knead and wait (like when you're using a sauce for leftovers) for fresh bread dough. Because of the unhealthfulness (New word there!) we limit the amount our little people eat however it is very easy to just keep picking away at it. Without the appearance of a slice of bread it's no problem at all to grab about 40 little knots and think it is the same serving size. Great recipe. Thanks!",

I put the dry coated dough balls in the Bundt pan, then poured melted butter over the top.  My pan is pretty heavy duty, so it took forty minutes to bake, but the results were FABULOUS.   Every guest LOVED them, even the baby, who licked the cheese coating off the bread.  I will be making this again and again, and encourage you to make the same mistake I did by adding cheese!",
