I presoaked the beans by putting them in hot water and letting them sit while we went to church (I actually goofed and threw 1/2 pinto beans and 1/2 blackeyed peas by mistake, but it turned out great!)  When I got home around 2ish, I transferred them (with their liquid) to the crockpot.  I added 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp bacon grease (didn't have bacon).  I let this cook for a couple of hours and then added a large handful of fresh chopped cilantro.  (I didn't use the jalapeno or tomato.)  I added salt (about 1/2 to 1 Tbl)to taste near the end of cooking time.  It took about 4 hrs to get a great tasting bean with some juice.  You could drain and mash (I \"mash\" in the blender with some liquid) to get refried beans - might try that with some leftovers, if there is some!  Great recipe!  Did cut in half though!",

There is one thing that is not mentioned you need salt but not till After they have softened or they will not get soft. I use chicken bouillon. I season these beans with almost anything in the spice rack bay leaves smoked paprika garlic cumin pepper oregano. My hubby loves beans and would eat them every day. If you want to make Cowboy beans out of this use a can of pickled jalapenos chorizo ham bacon tomato cilantro. These are Great for a party! Garnish with sliced radishes cheese and sour cream.
