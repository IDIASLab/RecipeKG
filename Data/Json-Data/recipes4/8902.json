I did a little tweaking to it and sauteed the garlic onion herbs and mushroom stems (after putting the stems and onion in a food processor) in the butter for about 10 minutes on medium heat then added the sausage and bread crumb and stirred it up. After it was thoroughly mixed I spooned it into the caps baked it and topped it with the cheese. Came out superb. I used three Trader Joe's Italian Sausage links.",
