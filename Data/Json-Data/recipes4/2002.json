It's great for large families and limited time/energy. Very simple to prepare and 110% better than hamburger helper.\nI substituted the hamburger for ground turkey and the beef broth for chicken but otherwise followed the recipe and the result was great! My kids loved it (even my 2 year old cleaned her plate)",

I used 3 frozen hamburger patties (Bubba Burger brand vidalia onion flavor) instead of the ground meat since it contains extra seasoning and is fairly easy to cook up. Also just so you know a 11.5 oz. (small can) of V8 juice is the perfect amount to use. Instead of white rice I used brown to make this a bit more healthy. Everyone in the family enjoted this some of us decided to add diced tomatoes and also thought that sour cream & shredded cheese would be good to add as well. We all agreed that this recipe is a lot like chili/sloppy joe/stuffed peppers. This made for a great 4th of July dinner!",
