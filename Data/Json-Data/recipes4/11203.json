I didn't have any buttermilk so I used the old trick of making sour milk from milk and lemon juice. Everything turned out fine but I didn't need all of the milk. Quick and easy if you want something \"cinnamony\". It's definitely biscuits though so if you're looking for actual cinnamon rolls this probably won't fix the craving! Pretty tasty!",

No worries...the menfolk were happy campers. One said it was one of the best cinnamon rolls he'd ever had. Used the glaze on 1/2 of them and some pre-made cream cheese frosting on other 1/2. Yummilicous!!! Will make again!!",
