My original intent for this recipe was for today's lunch...I started it last night and after letting the pasta chill I added the remaining ingrediants (omitted the corn) and let chill overnight. About an hour before lunch I pulled this out of the fridge and although it had taste it was very dry. Per another reviewer I added some italian dressing (just enough to dampen the pasta) and put it back in the fridge to blend and cooked an alternative lunch (lemon parmesan spaghetti) instead. I just pulled this salad out to taste-test after letting it sit with the Italian dressing addition (apprx 2 hours) and it is fantastic!! I can hardly stop eating it! The heat is \"warm\" (not spicy or hot) due to the chili powder but very tasty. Love it and will continue to make again and again. Thanks Holly!",
