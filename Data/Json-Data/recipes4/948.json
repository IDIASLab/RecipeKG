The directions are a bit contradictory as my Pepperidge Farm (sage/onion) dry stuffing mix directions called for chicken broth butter onions & celery to prepare. So all I additionally added was 1 Honey Crisp apple 1 - 7 oz box of maple flavor turkey sausage (cooked and crumbled) and a handful of toasted coursely chopped walnuts. Didn't have water chestnuts on hand. Added fresh grnd pepper and a bit of fresh grated nutmeg. I bake as a side dish as I don't stuff my turkey. Cooked covered for 30 minutes then stirred it around. Baked for another 15 min uncovered or until top a bit browned. I would add more sausage next time as it wasn't noticable. Otherwise...good idea you can fiddle around with. Oh can be prepared a day ahead and refrigerated (covered). Bring to room temp before baking or it will need longer cooking time.",
