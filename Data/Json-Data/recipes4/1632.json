I know many reviewers have had a problem with the bottom crust being soggy.  Here are some helpful hints to avoid that: If you choose to use the roasted peppers, pat them dry with a paper towel.  Be sure to get hard salami, not cooked salami.  Some deli meats, like ham, are too juicy, so try a different kind of ham - I've gotten apple/honey ham (it's dryer).  Let the pan cool for at least 15 minutes to allow the filling to set up.  For a nice presentation, I cut into squares and place them on a platter with paper doilies.  The paper doilies absorb some of the extra moisture on the bottom crust.  I hope this was helpful!  ENJOY! :)",

Once I spread the bottom crust in the pan, I covered it with a thin layer of sun dried tomato pesto and baked it for 6 minutes.  While that was baking I dried the roasted red peppers between 2 paper towels like others suggested, I also dried the ham that way too.  On the semi-baked bottom layer, I put a layer of prvolone, then salami, then ham, then pepperoni, then a layer of shredded mozzarella, then I sprinkled some garlic powder over all that.  I used 4 eggs and about 5-6 tablespoons of parmesan and put the top layer of crescent rolls on and used 1 more egg for an egg wash on the top of the dough.  I baked it at 375 for 20 minutes without foil, checked it and found it getting to be a little too brown and loosely tented it with foil for the last 25 minutes.  I let it cool in the pan for 30 minutes before cutting it.  I cut it into about 40 little pieces, held them together with toothpicks and served at room temp. They were THE HIT of the party and there was some good food there!!  Thanks for such a great recipe and all the good reviews!",

I also decided to add 1 teaspoon of garlic powder to the egg mixture which added just a hint of garlic. It was a little expensive when adding up all the deli meats and cheeses but definitely worth it. I gave it 4 stars because of cost and I felt it was only good not unbelievable. If you are making this for 10 or more people I highly recommend doubling the recipe and making two dishes worth. When it comes to the cheese amounts I recommend getting 8-10 slices of each instead of going by weight as this will ensure you're able to cover the entire dish. I will probably not be making this again.",

If you like italian cold cuts this is the recipe for you. I find the roasted red peppers are easiest to work with if you lay them flat on a cutting board and press down with several paper towels then dice and do the paper towel maneuver again. I also set the oven for 375\u00baF and baked with foil on for 25 minutes and off for 20. It's MUCH easier to cut and serve if you let them cool a good 20-25 minutes after coming out of the oven. I served the squares with a sun-dried tomato basil pesto sauce (just dried herbs from Tastefully Simple mixed with equal parts sour cream and mayonnaise). Delectable!",
