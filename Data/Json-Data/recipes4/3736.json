I did add an extra 1T of Mayo and 1T cheese knowing that we like wetter saucier food in general. The cheese was half sharp and half Mozz. I did use the onion/celery in specified amounts and just for color I put in 1 tsp of shivered/diced red bell. Couple of Tsp of garlic powder. Some ground black pepper. Used Grand bicuits. Served with a newly developed \"whatsinthepantry\" recipe of 3 cans of Progresso tomato soups - 1 basil 1 Parmesan & 1 hearty tomato. Good for dipping. I will try this again and again. I want to try a flakier more layered biscuit as well as using crescent roll to form triangle pouch. Also plan to use all types of fillings. Thank you for the springboard!",
