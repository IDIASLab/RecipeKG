Despite the fact it's got my dreaded \"casserole\" in its name, I really liked this!  Both Mr. LTH and I thoroughly enjoyed this.  It's not the most *healthy* veggie side, so I can't say for sure I'll make it often, but I do see myself making it again.  I prepped it the evening before for next day baking.  I'd fully intended to toast the bread crumbs before baking, but then i remembered I'm lazy, so I didn't (I did broil for minute at the end of baking to toast them).  THANKS for the recipe!",

About half got eaten at Christmas dinner, but we did have a ton of food, and people seemed to like it.  My biggest concern is with the method; next time, I think I'd make an actual roux as the flour and milk mixture clumped up while making it.  During baking and cooling it did thicken, but I prefer the roux method even if it dirties another pot.  Thanks for the recipe!",
