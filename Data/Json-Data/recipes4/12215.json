Pre-making this drink allows the host to have more time to socialize rather than bar-tending plus you don't have bottles all over the place. I made plenty and enjoyed leftovers later in the week. Despite all of the alcohol this froze solid in our deep freeze. We defrosted it a little in the microwave then used a sturdy spoon to scrape ice into cups. The frozen aspect slows the drinking down which is nice for a social gathering. The drink has very good flavor but doesn't taste strong. Yet still it's very effective. The plastic pitcher I used cracked from the freezer.",
