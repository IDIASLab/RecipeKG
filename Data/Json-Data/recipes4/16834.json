I made the recipe exactly as written. I used dried oyster mushrooms and loved the flavor! I almost used fresh mushroom since they're cheaper than dried but do not I repeat DO NOT skimp out on this! The dried mushrooms add such a lovely flavor that is more concentrated than fresh and a nice texture. It was almost a pity tossing out the soaking liquid from the mushrooms. I'm thinking I may use that liquid as part of the water requirements next time. The only thing I might suggest is adding the potatoes halfway through cooking. I found they were falling apart by the time the soup was done. Thank you Kathie for sharing your dad's soup!",
