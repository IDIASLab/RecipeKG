Also didn't mix this in the bread machine; did it by hand. Dissolved the yeast in warm (110) water and let stand until foamy...then proceeded. Allowed to rise approx. an hour punched down put in loaf pan rise again for about 35 min and then baked at 350 until golden. My boys absolutely devoured it and I actually only got one small taste of it. The texture was perfect for toasting or a sandwich and had great flavor. Having another batch in rising so the rest of the family can enjoy some. Will be a keeper and probably a staple bread recipe for a long time in my house!",
