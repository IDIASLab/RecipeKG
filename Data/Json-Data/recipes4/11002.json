Then, I used 2 cans of low sodium beef broth instead of the water/bullion cubes.  I also ommitted the salt and used half the basil.  Finally, I added the frozen veggies during the last hour and a half of cooking (I didn't want them to get mushy by cooking all day) AND a small handful of macaroni noodles.  Thick but very good! Served with dinner rolls and it was a nice \"autumn\" dinner. Thanks!",
