The sauce does take a while to thicken--be sure to add the cornstarch & water mixture before the cheese and then let it GENTLY boil until it gets to the consistency you like before you add the cheese. It may also help to halve the recipe. Since it was just for the kids I cut the recipe down to two servings (which was plenty) and had no problem with thickening. This is definitely a keeper!",

I reduced the liquid to three c. since others had trouble thickening their sauce. Mine though it took a little while got to a nice thickness. I also increased the onion to 1 1/2 tsp. sauteed it in the butter and then lightly toasted the garlic before adding the half & half. At that point I added about 1/4 tsp. mustard powder (will probably double it next time) and like stylingmom added a little worstershire (about 1 tsp). I used about 16 oz. grated sharp cheddar as I didn't have American and the flavor was good but a bit grainy. I'll use American next time and see what the result is. All in all a great recipe but I highly recommend making 1/2 a batch unless your feeding a crowd. Thanks for the recipe ALISSMOM and your mother-in-law as well!",
