So I decided to throw caution to the wind and use a 15.25 oz box of spice cake mix and a 15 oz can of pumpkin puree because that's what I had on hand. Mixed the pumpkin and cake mix together which resulted in the consistency of peanut butter. Filled the muffin cups up to 2/3rds and used a small bent/offset icing knife, sprayed with non-stick spray, to kind of smooth out the batter.  Baked for 19 minutes and cooled. I had to eat three of these babies to make sure I liked them. Apparently I did. The top was firm with a moist inside. Maybe a dollop of whipped cream wouldn't hurt either.",
