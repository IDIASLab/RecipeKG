I have made them for 3 years now, and would suggest the following filling changes: boil the potatoes in the skins and then peel them, mash the potatoes rather than dicing, and add a dash of nutmeg to the filling to enhance the cheese flavour. As for the dough, I found it a bit tougher when cooked than the varenyky I grew up with. Search for an online recipe with fewer eggs, sour cream and butter in the dough; the sour cream seems to make the dough much more workable and tender. Also, after boiling varenyky it seems to help to subsequently cook them even more, either re-heating them in a casserole dish in the oven, or frying them in a pan with a bit of butter an onion. This helps to make them even more tender. This is great logistically when you want to prepare the varenyky well before a meal but re-heat them to serve.",

They do take a while to make, but perogies in general take a while to make.  I would mash the potatoes rather than leaving them in cubes though.  This makes it easier to handle.  If you mash the potatoes 5 potatoes is sufficient.  Mixing some bacon bits into the potatoes also helps to add flavour.  Overall, great recipie.  Worth trying~!",

I would give the dough 3 stars because mine turned out tough and very difficult to roll out. That may have been my fault though since for some reason I had to add more water than called for because it was too dry with the half cup.
