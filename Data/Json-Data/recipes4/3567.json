I sauteed my veggies including carrot rings in a mixture of EVOO and butter before adding it to the stock. I also added a couple bay leaves. We don't really like kidney beans or frozen peas and carrots so we omitted those. This works really well in the crockpot just add the rice in right before serving. TIP: Add in your leftover gravy. It not only thickens your soup a bit it adds another layer of flavor! It's great to add in your leftover veggies too just to use everything up in one fell swoop. That's the great thing about turkey soup it's so forgiving and you can make it work to feed everyone you know. EDITED REVIEW: Yes I add my leftover gravy. I make sure to add cold gravy that I've skimmed off the fat previously. You can prevent fat issues by cooling the soup before serving so you can skim off the fat if you so choose. You can cut corners and use a canned gravy which makes the soup taste great with little effort.",

They were great:) I will follow this recipe again in the future. oh! I forgot to mention that instead of adding the frozen veggies I added the leftover steamed veggies from thanksgiving dinner. So I threw in the carrots broccoli and brussel sprouts into the blender with the 1/2 cups of stock. I also only had 1/2 cup of rice so I added a 1/2 cup of orzo. I found that this soup was even better the second day... and with a couple squirts of smoky tabasco in my bowl!",
