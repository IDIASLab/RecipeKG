I also added a little chicken broth and some water before baking since I didn't have any tin foil to cover it. It baked in about 70 minutes and tasted wonderful! It's definitely comfort food but also pretty healthy especially with the extra cabbage. The only thing I'd do differently when I make it again is double the garlic.",
