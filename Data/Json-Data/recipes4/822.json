I top with a bit of butter, and drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, garlic and sprinkle a little Italian herb seasoning(Tones). I make huge veggie packets because I want lots left over. Carrots are really good in it too. My husband flips the packets halfway through cooking so  to cook evenly on both sides. They get roasted and yummy. My favorite way to do veggies. I thought I could achieve the same thing by doing the packets in the oven but they don't come out as good. Definately grill! I bet it would be good with corn in it too, either small cut up ears of corn or kernels. Yum!",

Grilling was a cinch, I even kept it on the upper rack in the grill and they cooked thoroughly no problem.  The family loved it.",
