I am rating this a 3 star due to the excessive salt the first time I made it. 2nd time I made it I soaked the beans overnight and then proceeded to follow the recipe using pork roast loin to help cut down on the fat. Added an extra tablespoon of garlic powder 1/2 tablespoon of ancho chili powder and 1/4 cup of dried minced onion and let it cook adding 1 tablespoon of garlic salt in place of the regular salt at the end. Thought it was going to have to much liquid but after shredding the meat and adding back to the crockpot it was just perfect! TWO SIDE NOTES: 1.) Adding a potato while cooking will take the gassiness out of beans! 2.) Adding salt BEFORE the beans finish cooking guarantee they will remain hard - wait until the end to add your salt!",

The flavors all marry so wonderfully. It is a super friendly quick reheat for leftovers too! (OR we've freezed the leftovers and reheat in a boil in a bag method for a whole other dinner!

I used the whole pound of dry beans and personally I think that a little less meat (or more beans) would've been better but I like more beans than meat in my dishes. I used half the amount of salt and it was perfect. The dish does come out soupy but I kept all the liquid in it and used a slotted spoon to scoop everything out extremely tasty. I did not soak my beans so I checked it after it was cooking for 6 hours and the beans needed a little more help cooking so I put the crock on high for the last two hours it was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe.",

It was very salty so I would cut the salt by half especially if you're eating it on crushed tortilla chips. Covered in lettuce tomatoes salsa shredded cheddar and sour cream it's awesome. Also great in burritos might throw some crushed tortilla chips in there also for some crunch.

Instead of flour tortillas try using cheese Doritos.. just make sure you crunch them up real good.. put a layer on your plate first..then add the meat/bean mixture and all your favorite toppings!

Cooked low for 9 hours and then shredded my pork and placed back in the crock and kept on warm for about another hour. Lots of liquid but used a strainer. Was very good but the second day...REALLY good. It made so much I have two containers that should feed four people in my freezer. Update: We used some of the leftovers to stuff some bell peppers just added a can of black beans and tomatoes and green chilies. What a great way to use some leftovers. Update #2: Still had leftovers and used them to make enchiladas just added in some cheese canned rotel jalapenos and rolled up in flour tortillas topped with enchilada sauce and more cheese and baked for 25 minutes...fantastic!",
