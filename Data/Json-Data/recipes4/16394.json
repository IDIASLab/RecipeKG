                "reviewBody": "I used this recipe as a guide since I had a pork loin roast. I tend to avoid putting boneless pork chops & chicken breasts in the slow cooker because in my experience they seem to break down too quickly. I wanted to use some apple to cut the sourness of the kraut, but not too much, and definitely not too much liquid, because the kraut, onions, apple & meat also release much juice as they cook. Based on the many comments from 4 similar recipes on this site I incorporated the following: I seasoned a 4 pound boneless pork loin roast (with Stubb\u2019s all- natural pork spice rub, black pepper, garlic powder & a little salt) & seared all sides on the stove in a little oil. Transferred the meat to the slow cooker with the fat side up (do not add the oil\u2014it gets a burnt flavor with high smoke point searing) & added 1 large jar of all natural sauerkraut with juice, 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 2 bay leaves,  a sprinkling of caraway seeds, 10 whole juniper berries & 2 teaspoons dark brown sugar.  I then topped with 1/2 of a very large granny smith apple (peeled and sliced), 1 medium red onion (sliced) and 2 tablespoons butter (cut into chunks). Cooked for 6 hours at 250 degrees and it was so tender, juicy and flavorful & the kraut/onions tasted great. You can\u2019t taste the apple at all & the small amount of apple, brown sugar & butter cuts the sourness of the kraut juice. Served it with mashed potatoes. My husband said he thought he'd died and gone to heaven, lol, it was that good! :)",

I used caraway seeds which the recipe author says could be substituted for fennel (I typically only use fennel seed in Italian dishes).  First, I wouldn\u2019t add \u201cwater to cover\u201d because I ended up with way too much liquid at the end.  The pork chops ended up being very tender and moist, but the apples pretty much cooked to mush, and the sauerkraut just didn\u2019t have much flavor.  Overall, this meal was OK, but a bit bland.  My friend\u2019s sauerkraut recipe calls for juniper berries, whole cloves, and a bay leaf which bring incredible flavor to the kraut, and I\u2019ll never again make sauerkraut without them.  As suggested, I did serve this with mashed potatoes on the side .",

It was in the slow cooker for 6 hours on low and I made garlicky mashed potatoes to accompany it. Although I loved the pork chops (they came out so juicy and tender) no one enjoyed the sauerkraut onions and apples. The apples and onions were still crisp even after the standard time in the slow cooker and the sauerkraut was somewhat bitter and acidic. I will definitely make my own adjustments to this recipe and try it again. The idea was great it just needs help. Next time I will cook the onions until translucent and soften the apples before putting them in the bottom of the cooker. I also thought that adding some apple juice as the fluid and some garlic cloves for flavor would be really good! The sauerkraut needs something sweet like apple juice to neutralise it. Also juniper berries and a bay leaf wouldn't go amiss! Thanks for the recipe idea though!",
