I thought I would try this \"greens and beans\" recipe as a change. It was a major success. They not only wanted the recipe but took home the little that was left in \"people bags\". Easy and delicious. And \"greens and beans\" was a catchy name they liked too. I briefly cooked the onions in the olive oil. A dash of your favorite hot pepper vinegar will brighten up the greens but I elected to just put the bottle on the table and let each adjust for their taste.",

My favorite is with Swiss Chard - you must cook it quite awhile so it becomes tender and mild. Beet greens are a close second! Ceci beans (garbanzo beans) may be used instead of cannellini beans and it's just as good without beans too. I love this stuff so much I could make a meal of it on its own.",
