Two suggestions: If you are a lemon lover like me, squeezing a wedge of lemon into your soup or floating a lemon slice on top a=can make a good thing even better. Also, if you aren't going to use all the soup at once, instead of putting the spinch into the pot with the rest of the soup, just put a portion into the bottom of the bowl and pur your hot soup on top. Spinach cooks pretty well instantly, and you will be saved from having slimy spinch leaves when you reheat the leftovers. Thanks for the great recipe.",
