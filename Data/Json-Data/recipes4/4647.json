Before the coating sets up, stick the flat side of an unwrapped chocolate kiss opposite the tail, to make a pointy-nosed face. Pick out two nicely shaped slivers of almond, and insert them between the chocolate kiss and the dipped cherry to make little ears. Use a toothpick to make two small dots of melted coating on the face for eyes; stick two little red candies to the coating dots. Repeat with the rest of the cherries. Allow the coating to set until firm and cool, about 30 minutes.\n"

But they are also cute at Halloween or anytime! I never use the red dots. They work best when you make them with friends so you can do an assembly line or else the chocolate hardens too fast. If you can't make them with friends then only make a few at a time for the best result. I also like to line up the \"ears\" in advance that way they are about equal sizes. They are not the most tasty but they are still so fun! Also if you want the face and body to be similar color use 1/2 melted kisses for dunking the cherries this will help. Have fun!",

But I will be making them again soon for Christmas I'll be sure to take a picture then. You can easly change up the color and flavor just by the type of kisses you use such as the cookies and cream and remember that if you can't find a chocolate to match for dipping you can melt kisses and use that to dip your cherries. These are very cute and tasty and always recive lot's of praise.",
