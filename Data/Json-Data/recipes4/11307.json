It was not quick; the vegetables took a long time to cook so I broiled them instead of baked them halfway through. I also used olive oil on them. They were a little bland; next time I would use some seasoning with them. It also took a LONG time for the vegetable mixture to congeal and the cheese to melt. I also used only one carrot and that was perfect. The potatoes were crispy and the whole thing was incredible!",

But I tried it again today w/several modifications and really liked it! I reduced the carrot to 1 and chopped it VERY small and left out the cilantro entirely.:) I also substituted cheddar cheese as I couldn't find the manchego at the grocery store. I also found I needed to add salt & pepper. So....though it doesn't much resemble the original it was still tasty. Thank you!!",

The whole thing needed salt and my rice didn't brown. I used mozzerlla instead of the suggested cheese and omitted the chili and cerrano......lol although this sounds like a negative review...with the changes I would definately try this again.",
