It was difficult to find one that didn't call for Bisquick (which I did not have). This one was great! I only had about a quarter of a pound of sausage so I adjusted the recipe which meant I should use 1/4 of an egg??? I left that out and added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese instead. Also I didn't have any stuffing mix so I substituted Progresso Italian bread crumbs. I was very pleased with the results. And one more thing I noticed in the picture that these balls make quite a mess of the pan so I lined mine with foil. No mess and they were just fabulous. Thank you for the great recipe!",

I doubled it and used two boxes of Stove Top chicken flavor two rolls of Jimmy Dean sage sausage and I added a 16oz. package of finely shredded cheddar/jack cheese. I omitted the onion and celery but added some onion powder (running short on time). I missed the part about changing the temperature setting and ended up cooking these on 350 for the entire time but did follow the instructions for covering the batch. Nearly all of them were eaten and I got many compliments. Even my husband who doesn't like sausage really liked them. I will definitely use this one again! Thanks!",
