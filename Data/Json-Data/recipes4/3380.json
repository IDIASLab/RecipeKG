I followed the recipe pretty much as is but I did sub ff sour cream for part of the light mayo per personal taste. I also realized I'd forgotten the croutons so I topped w/bread crumbs and parm instead. I baked in a large Fiestaware bowl instead of an 8X8 for better presentation. This was very well received at a birthday dinner I made it for. I will make this regularly; thanks for a great recipe!",

I also omitted the croutons and mixed the parmesan into the mixture. Every place I've taken this it has disappeared too quickly and gotten rave reviews. It's easy except for a little mess filling the phyllo cups but oh so worth it. Bake at 350 for about 10 minutes then sprinkle with the paprika.",
