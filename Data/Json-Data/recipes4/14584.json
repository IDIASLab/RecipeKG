My only complaint about this recipe is that the strawberries need some sugar. I suppose it depends on how sweet your berries are mine were sweet but not enough. And I ended up thickening the berries with about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch. Thanks for the recipe I will be making this again.",

I found this recipe (didn't use the toppings) and it was amazing. The brioche soaks up so much of the eggs and cream mixture that the final result is almost custardy. I can see why this is the true french bread for french toast! While I have enjoyed challah in the past for this, the enriched eggy butteriness of brioche is perfect.",
