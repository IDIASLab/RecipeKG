I did tweak it a little though -- we are vegetarians so I subbed vegetable broth for the chicken broth. I also boiled then pureed a potato and a few broccoli stalks to make it creamy without adding fat. Also added a can of drained white cannelini beans to boost protein. Made a yummy hearty meal with crusty wholegrain bread -- will definitely make this again!",
