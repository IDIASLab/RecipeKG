Not what I expected on top of a cupcake.  We left the nuts off because the kids won't eat nuts and we left out the stick, but I bet that would be perfect for a party.  After sitting all night the caramel on top became runny (not sure why) and it ran off the top and down the sides of the cupcakes.  Glad we made them the same day we needed them.  Next time I will make a regular caramel icing to put on top, not just caramel mixed with a little bit of evap. milk.",
