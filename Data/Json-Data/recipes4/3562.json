I held the grill down for a minute and after that just let it be. The bread toasted better than I expected and had better color/texture where ever I had put the olive oil. Added the balsamic to the tomatoes instead of the bread (was afraid the bread would get soggy) and added S&P to the fresh mozzarella. Super fast & easy & tasty = 5 stars.",
