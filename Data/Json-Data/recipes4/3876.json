I had my first crawfish boulette last week at a little restaurant in Lafayette(yeah, don't know how I ever missed these) and have been dying to make them ever since.  Needless to say, myself and better half are absolutely NOT DISSAPPOINTED!! Easy to assemble and quick to cook.  Could not ask for a better recipe.  I did do as the other review suggested and left a few crawfish whole for texture.  Great idea.   Other than that, I followed as written.  I can't wait to make these again for my entire family!  Thank you submitter!!  P.S. Food processor is absolutely necessary. Glad I bought one especially for this!",
