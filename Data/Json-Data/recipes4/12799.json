I would use the same amount of rice and water century egg salt and add the green onions when serving but just regular pork would be used cut into fine strips or ground. In Hong Kong They would add some grated coconut mixed into the ground pork. Use white pepper to taste and the deep fried Chinese bread is great with this.",

The owner said it goes out fast and he kindly saved a package for me. I made the recipe just as it is given and will make this often. The preserved duck eggs make it even better. This is a recipe for those who are familiar with asian ingredients and enjoy them. For those new to the duck eggs a small cup served with other favorite asian dishes would be a nice way to introduce them to this delicious congee. Thank you for this recipe.",
