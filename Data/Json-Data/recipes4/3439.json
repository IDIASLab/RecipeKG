One thing that I was wondering before making this and would like to clarify for anyone else contemplating this recipe is that the pepperoncinis did NOT make the salad spicy at all! Instead, they added the PERFECT ammount of flavor(and I used pretty spicy pepperoncinis). The recipe didn't say what to do with the peppers, so I diced them finely and removed the seeds, and it was gorgeous! My family has zero tolerance for spicy food, and they loved it! This is easily the best potato salad recipe I have ever come across. For best results, refrigerate overnight. ",

I used a double dose of the Dry Ranch Seasoning mix from this site(minus the salt and plus dill) instead of prepared ranch and used chopped pickles instead of relish. I don't have celery seed, so I omitted it and added a couple chopped  stalks of celery. This recipe didn't specify which kind of onion to use, so I used a quarter of a red I had on hand. You really don't need 1 1/2 tsp. of salt in this, the flavor in this salad is just fine with just a couple nice shakes. Very flavorful.",

I am giving it a 4 star because it is darn good and deserves the rating.  I am so tired of people giving a recipe a 1 star rating when they have not tried the recipe.  But yet they cut it down because it has a high fat content.  These people need to back off.  I have lost 177 lbs without surgery.  I do not need to have someone lower a rating on a recipe because they can't handle the fat.  Better they should cut down on their portions.  It is not about the fat it is about putting down the fork.  So for those of us who can practice portion control and know that fats can contribute flavor, give this one a try.  It is fairly traditional with a bit of a twist.  ENJOY it.  I did.",

I made it early in the morning and let it refrigerate for about 8 hours before we ate--it was really good.  However, the next day was just fantastic.  If you have the time, try to make this a day ahead.  One note, one reviewer stated that the recipe was too salty (even though she didn't follow the original recipe!)...it does seem salty before you refrigerate it, but once the flavors blend, everything evens out.  If you're worried about salt, I'd cut it in half and then check before you serve.  Thanks Cheftini :)",
