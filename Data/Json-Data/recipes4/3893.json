I boiled my potatoes in homemade chicken stock and because I only had half the amount of Velveeta called for I used half Velveeta and half Cracker Barrel 2% extra sharp white cheddar. Nice basic cheddar potato soup that went well with black forest ham grilled cheese. My oldest boy chowed down on this with me. I did add a bit of Frank's Hot Sauce when I ate mine. Next time I might add a little more cheese. NOTE: Almost all of the ingredients I used in this soup I bought cheaply at my Grocery Outlet. This soup cost next to nothing to make and it doubled real well.",

I told everyone that they had to at least try it and every single one ended up loving this soup! My potatoes were very large so I used 9 instead of 12. I also used only 4 cups of milk...I saved the potato liquid and used a cup of that in place of the last cup of milk. I hated to see that flavorful water go to waste and the soup was very rich creamy and yummy without the last cup of milk! This recipe is just what I wanted cheap easy family friendly and yummy!

We loved it and this will now be a regular in our home. I 1/2 the recipe down to 6 servings. The only thing I changed is it called for 1/2 lb of Velvetta and I used the whole pound because we are cheese lovers. The hubby and I both ate leftovers for lunch the next day at work and we both had to reheat in microwaves. Reheated it was still very good and we didn't have to add water like you sometimes have to do with other soups. Nice creamy texture. Next time I may add a little bacon or ham (after the holidays with leftovers) but it is perfectly fine as written. Also be sure to read Junebugs comment about adding salt and pepper while boiling the potatoes and adding extra cheese if you wish. This is also something I can make quickly after getting home from work so that's a big in my book! Thanks for an awesome recipe Junebug!!:)",
