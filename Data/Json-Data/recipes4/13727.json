Instead I tasted each part (chili powder tuna wasabi) instead of the sum of the parts: Spicy tuna. The tuna was dry as noted by other reviewers and somewhat fishy. To the rice I added a bit of salt and sugar and it was great... but not good enough to fix the tuna. Sorry.",

Maybe it was the tuna from a can or maybe it's because I thought it was a tad too dry. I feel like you needed more mayo and spiciness to mix in with the tuna. I bought a little container of spicy sauce from Wegman's in the pre-made sushi section. I was 99 cents if I remember correctly. I put a little dollop of this on each piece and it SO improved the taste.",
