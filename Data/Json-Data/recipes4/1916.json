It should read 3 large cans of whole tomatoes, crushed by hand NOT 3 tomatoes, that would make this very spicy as well as very thick.  I don't remember if I wrote this part as well, but I usually drain the 2 cans of beans, and I leave the liquid of the rem. cans. Luckily not many have been effected by the mistake.  thanks again.",

Just kind of taste and add till you get it where you really love it.  I used Original Boca Burgers that I broke up into little pieces, and like so many other reviewers, no one could tell it wasn't meat! It is, however, very important to break the Boca Burgers up into tiny pieces, otherwise, if you leave big chunks I think you can taste a little difference.  This does make a huge amount.  I think it would easily feed 10 or 12....especially if you were to put it over rice and serve with maybe some grated cheddar, sour cream and chopped avacados.....chopped onions would be good too!!",

I added 1 zuchini, 1 red bell pepper, 1 can pinto beans, 1 bag of frozen corn (we like it better than canned), and 1 can tomato paste (I drained my beans and added water; plus I like a tomato based chili). I also added a few splashes of tobasco sauce, I think my chili powder must have been milder than others because we did not have enough spice. I reccommend using the whole stewed tomatoes because they have a thicker consistency. You can use your kitchen scissors and cut them up while they are still in the can. I think I will add a can of white beans next time. There really is a lot of the veggie meat and I like a fair amount of beans. I froze the chili in individual containers and made corn bread muffins and froze those too. We were able to have several chili/muffin lunches.\nThanks for the great recipe Cal :)",

Couldn't much drain the chile peppers, and I wondered whether to drain the beans (don't). \n\nTurned out very well, beautiful, though I might use a little less chili powder next time (and I used a skimpy 1/4 cup). Also used only 1 jalepeno - it was plenty spicy tonight, and will be spicier tomorrow. I used about a teaspoon of salt instead of a tablespoon and it was enough.\n\nModifying review to add my experience cooking it in a slow cooker... I prepared the veggies (onion, garlic, green pepper, celery) as instructed, and then transferred them to the slow cooker before throwing in the rest of the ingredients except for the corn. I cooked on high for a couple hours and added the corn about an hour before the end and turned my cooker down to low at the same time (about 3 hours in the slow cooker in all). It turned out brilliantly. I was worried the veggie crumbles might get rubbery, but they did not, and the spices were mellower but still very tasty. Huge hit at the office, even though they are all meateaters.",

I did make a few adjustments.  I used only one jalapeno and added salt to taste rather than the entire tablespoon all at once.  I'd guess I used about half a tablespoon.  I used canned crushed tomatoes in place of the fresh ones (a 28 oz can I think) and added an extra can of beans since I had some on hand.  I cheated and used ground turkey in place of the veggie crumbles and I let the whole thing sit on the burner over low heat for about two hours instead of the 45 mins.  The result was amazing!  This is awesome chili, I can't wait to make it again...thanks!",
