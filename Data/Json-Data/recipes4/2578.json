They were way too sugary! The dough was very crumbly and I had a hard time keep the cookies from falling apart. They didn't turn golden even after being in the oven for 10 minutes. I would not make these again.",

I do like the soft melt in the mouth texture thanks to the corn flour. I also opt to brush it with egg yolk for better browning and bake it small like the store bought ones (about 3/4inch in diameter) and slightly flatten. Oh I also add 1/2 tsp of salt. Omit corn flour is you prefer slightly firmer cookies.",
