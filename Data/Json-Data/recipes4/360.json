Although, I used a meat thermometer, because my loin was perfect in 1 1/2 hrs.\n\nThe second time I made this, I pureed 4 cloves of garlic, 1/2 of the rosemary, and enough olive oil to bind it together.    I rubbed my pork loin w/ the paste, then put in a ziploc bag in the fridge for a few hours to marinate.  YUM!  I threw in some veggies with my loin (carrots, onions and    celery) and poured about 1/4 cup of wine in the bottom of the pan.  Roasted for about 1.5 hours covered, and everything was perfect!  I scooped out the veggies, and then used a can of chicken stock and some cornstarch to make a gravy out of the pan drippings.  I served with buttered herb rice and the roasted vegetables.  BIG hit!  5 stars!  Thanks!",

I browned the roast then put it in the crock pot and dumped the minced garlic, you know the stuff in a jar and the rosemary on top of the roast and then cut holes in it a kinda pushed the stuff inside and left some on top too.  I didn't make a paste.  Then I drizled a little olive oil on tbe top added salt, pepper and accent.  Threw some dehydrated minced onions on top.  Added the wine and cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hrs.  It came out just as good if not better then the first time.  \nThis is the absolute best pork roast.\n\nI'm not even sure if I used a loin.  I used that big giant pork roast and cut it and made 3 roasts out of it.  Not the small loin cut.",

Mine 2.25lb roast took just over 1 1/2 hours to cook. Also, once the meat is done cooking, cover it with foil and let it rest for at least 10 minutes or it won't be as juicy when you cut it. The roast temp will rise a bit even after you take it out of the oven so account for that in your cooking temp.\r\nI didn't have any white wine so I subbed white wine vinegar and chicken broth for the wine. Still turned out delicious!",

I too reduced the cooking time to 1 hour and fifteen minutes and I even had a little over three pounds of pork loin.  I also put the garlic/rosemary rub on the meat early in the morning and let it sit covered in the fridge all day. I used very little olive oil, just enough in my mini food processor to hold the rosemary and garlic together, around 2 to 3 tablespoons.  My other recommendation would be to double the amount of rosemary/garlic mixture, especially when using more than 2 pounds of meat.  I served this along with roasted potatoes and sauteed green beans with almonds........yum!",

I used fresh rosemary from my garden instead of dried, and added just a little onion and olive oil to the paste rub. About 1/4 through the cooking process, I added a little chicken broth and a little wine to the bottom of the roast, and about 20 minutes later, I turned the roast. I cooked the roast for 1 and \u00bd hours total, covered it with foil for about 10 minutes, and it came out done but very moist.  I recommend using a meat thermometer, cooking time really depends on the cut and size of your meat. I added more chicken broth and wine to the drippings in the pan, a touch of flour to thicken, and everything turned out delicious! I served this with asparagus risotto.

I guessed on the cooking time, but it was about 3 hours.  I cut the slits real deep to put the paste mixture in, then blended the olive oil with the remaining mixture in the same processor to rub on the roast.  I used a roasting pan with a lid and had a ton of juice to baste with.  Oh, I also sliced a sweet onion and layered the bottom of the pan with it and put the roast on top.  And when I put the wine in the drippings, I mixed it with some corn starch first, to thicken the gravy up a little.  It was delicious!  I will most likely be making this again.",
