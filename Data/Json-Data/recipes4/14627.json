I followed the recipe exactly as written - the only thing I changed was to bake these instead of frying. Bake at 425 for 12 min., turning crab cakes halfway through cooking time. My whole family agreed these were as good as and possibly even better than served at restaurants. Chock full of crabmeat and very little filler. I would recommend using the Old Bay seasoning...gives the crab cakes that extra kick!Excellent! I posted a picture for the recipe.",

I threw in some chives, cumin, celery salt, basil, a tiny bit of thyme, cumin, and a smidge of chili pepper. Added an extra egg because they didn't have enough body.  I baked them, then broiled them for the last 5 min. so that they'd be a little crispier on the outside. Threw together a tartar sauce with diced pickles, olive oil mayo, and a little hot sauce.  So good!  Am sending this recipe to a few of my friends!",

That has as much resemblance to real crab meat as canned tuna has to fresh sushi grade tuna. Get fresh LUMP crab meat.

Saltine crackers are good to add, but 16 to a pound of crab meat is waaay too much. You aren't making saltine cakes, 4 or 5 at the most. The \"seafood seasoning\" should be Old Bay, don't use an imitation it's not worth it.",

The changes that I made, I will stick with when I make these again: I used Panko instead of Saltines, Lemon Juice instead of Water, Dijon as the mustard, added one thinly sliced scallion, and most importantly I broiled them instead of frying in oil. Broiled on High 6 min, flipped and 4 min. They turned out perfectly cooked through and nicely browned. Thanks for the great recipe!",
