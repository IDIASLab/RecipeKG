Instead of \"3/4 cup tomato sauce\", use 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon \"no salt added\" tomato sauce (proportion is critical), Franks Red hot cayenne sauce (nice vinegar/pepper balance), Tone's Chili powder (seems to have proportionally less salt than average). I usually deep fry the wings for 10 minutes.  Baking is lower fat, but 30 minutes is a probably a little too short.  I like spicy food, and with the called for 1 tsp ground cayenne with the other proportions gives a good \"bite\" IMHO.  Hope you all enjoy... thanks for the nice comments!!!",

However, I did change the recipe to: 1 bottle Franks (12 oz), 1 (8 oz) can Hunts No Salt Tomato Sauce, 1/3 cup Unsalted Butter, 4 dashes Cayenne & 1 1/2 Tbsp Chili Powder. Baked in preheated 400 F oven for 45 min - dipped in sauce which I boiled over med. temp for 5 min.; replaced on clean 11 x 17 pan, baked add'l 15 min, Dipped again in remaining sauce, baked for 10 min. Then removed from oven and the meat was sooooo tender!  (Probably should bake on a broiler pan to keep as much fat separated from chicken to make crispier) But loved it - all my guests raved and asked for the recipe!  Hurray for a tasty buffalo wings that you can bake and not have to fry!  Thanks for all the reviews who contributed to the outcome of this recipe!",

Baked the wings for 30 minutes at 400 (using the broiler pan to drain the fat) and after 30 minutes basted with the sauce.  The sauce: omitted the tomato sauce and used hot wing sauce (Wing-Time), garlic and butter.  Also added in the cayenne pepper and chili powder (Also added in 1 tblsp Chili Garlic sauce which they serve at Thai restaurants).  Mixed with a wisk.  We like it very spicy, lips are still burning.  Cooked for 5 minutes more, added another layer of sauce, cooked another 5 minutes at 300.  Then used the leftover sauce for dipping (if you dare) and cut up some celery and added ranch dressing.  \nVery good!",

I used all drumettes and I might add that the sauce was enough to do an entire frozen 4 lb bag of drummettes. My only regret is that I only did 24 drummettes instead of the whole bag. We easily could've eaten the whole bag--once thawed and cooked they shrink a lot. I did follow another person's advice and after the frist 45 min bake I dipped them in suace and placed in a clean dish for the remaining bake time. I served with celery ranch dressing and cornbread. I will be serving these a lot! Thanks!",

I made a half of batch the first day ... the sauce didn't seem to coat real thick . I had the remaining sauce in the fridge overnight to make the rest the next day ... after being in the fridge overnight the sauce was MUCH thicker and coated very nicely , so from now on I will mix the sauce a day ahead . Also my husband said they were not \" messy \" enough for wings so I actually dipped them one more time when I took them out of the oven ... I got a thumbs up on the recipe after that and it has now become the one I will always use for his wings",
