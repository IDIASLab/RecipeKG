I made a couple of alterations to make this recipe actually taste good instead of plan like many many recipes! LOL! OK I talk alot... let me tell you what I did: I only made half the recipe first. I substituted 2 Tablespoons of artificial sweetener and used 2 Tbs of fresh squeezed orage juice. I didn't use half of that amount because I really wanted the taste of it. 1/2 of vanilla and of course the margarine Instead of adding water I again used 2 Tablespoons of orange juice:) 1 cup of flour Since I didn't have any peanuts or peanut butter with nuts I didn't use the egg white or the peanuts; I used instead 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter 1/2 cup of raisins and I grated a large fresh orange and used half of the gratings plus I used a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon. Every oven seems to cook or bake differently anyway it baked very nicely for 20 minutes. They came out soft and a little sweet because of the raisins. I will make it again. You can e-mail me at royalblue33179@AOL.com about my alterations in this recipe tell me what you think. Type in the subject box peanut butter cookies. Goodbye and happy baking.",

I also put an additional teaspoons of vanilla in after tasting the dough. I added 1 Tablespoon of honey in addition to the artificial sweetner. Also since I can't have gluten I used 1 2/3 C brown rice flour and 1/3 C amaranth flour. I made one tray and was wishing they were a little sweeter so I dipped the tops of the rest in Xylitol (after rolling in peanuts). They come out looking glossy on top but delicious!",
