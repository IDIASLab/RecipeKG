Kashmir's cuisine combines the area's fruits and nuts with the ingredients and the cooking style of the Moghuls. This rich stew makes a marvelous main dish. Serve it with hot steamed rice or crusty breads. This is lovely!",

I started prepping the ginger and garlic, then thought to myself, \"Those onions are going to take awhile; I should get those going.\" So, while the onions were caramelizing, I finished the spice puree and cubed the lamb. I also added the saffron threads to the yogurt and let them soften for about 20 minutes. I had just about a pound and a half of lamb, but I made the full amount of sauce\u2014just reducing the chiles slightly. Oh, and I didn't have blanched almonds, so just used regular raw almonds. I think the leftovers are going to be even better than the original meal!",
