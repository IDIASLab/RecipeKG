It tastes very much like a famous crunchy peanut candy bar, and can be made in about 10 minutes (total time)! I like to buy a lot candy corn right after Halloween when it is on sale so it can be a very inexpensive candy to make. Sometimes I drizzle some melted milk chocolate on top of the semisweet chocolate after it's cooled just for decoration.",

The candy corn is what makes it all stick together and I felt it needed a little more sticky-ness they were just a little crumbly. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!",

The melting of the candy corn is pretty simple but you MUST work quickly with this as it becomes very hard to stir. Have your peanut butter measured and ready to add before you start melting the candy corn. I poured mine in a parchment lined small cookie sheet. Once it set up (I did not put it in the refrigerator) I lifted out the parchment to cut. This cut nicely into squares and was a nice addition to Christmas cookie/candy platters. Everyone liked it no one raved about it.",
