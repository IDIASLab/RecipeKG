I sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil with an onion and some garlic. I didn't have cream of mushroom but I had sour cream so I used that instead. I mixed the cream of chicken milk and sour cream. Then stirred the rice in then the mushroom mixture. I poured half in an oven dish layered the chicken then poured the rest on. Then topped with crushed ritz. Pretty good that way. My only big change would be to cut up the chicken and mix that in and just pour it all together.",

I'm not a big fan of recipes with cream soups but when you're short on time and you have hungry mouths to feed on a work night, this fits the bill!  I made this exactly as written EXCEPT, I mixed the remainder of the Onion Soup Mix with the canned soups and milk.  If I was to make this again, I would definitely use \"low sodium\" canned soups and only half of the package of Onion Soup Mix as it is extremely salty.  If you like salty foods, you will like this.  My boys, 12 yrs & 7 yrs old thought it was pretty good.  My husband ate it and thought it was \"good\", but they were not saying WOW!  This is a good dish to prepare when you are short on time for YOUR family.  I wouldn't make this for \"SPECIAL\" guests.  I served fresh brussel sprouts on the side as my family loves them.  This can be served with just about any fresh veggie, green beans, aspargus, brussel sprouts, or just a dinner salad.  Thanks for the EASY recipe when you are short on time!!!!",
