Also was the end of term foods lab test for my high school classes. If it did not \"squirt butter\" you did not get full marks:-) so here are a few tweeks to an already good recipe. Include oregano parsley & real minced garlic to the chilled butter. Once wrapped around the butter first roll the chicken in seasoned flour then the egg wash then the seasoned bread cracker or potato chip (plain) crumbs THEN wrap tightly in wax paper and chill for at least a half hour longer if time allows. Can be made a day ahead. Only unwrap when you are ready to place in the hot fat. This avoids the need for tooth picks completely.",
