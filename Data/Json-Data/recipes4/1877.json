Even though I anticipated some issues with this, I tried a half-batch exactly as written, and I had several problems: 1) It was really, REALLY bland; and 2) like other reviewers, I ended up with soggy-bottom salmon. I tweaked my second attempt quite a bit, with great results: Instead of using fresh spinach (which has a really high moisture content), I used very-well-drained frozen spinach. To give the spinach some needed flavor, I sauteed a mixture of finely-chopped mushrooms, garlic, shallots, nutmeg, butter, and salt for about 10 minutes, then added the spinach and sauteed for another 10-15 minutes to cook off as much moisture as possible (I hate to crash a recipe and rewrite it in the comments, but this seriously needed a flavor boost). I also removed the finished product to a rack to cool, which helped alleviate the sog factor. I'd say this dish is a good launching pad to add flavors that suit you - just do whatever you can to reduce the amount of moisture inside the pastry.",

I used frozen spinach, a 9-oz. box, but I cooked it in the microwave and squeezed all the water out.  Instead of salt and garlic powder, I used garlic salt.  I also brushed a little egg-beaters on the top (not sure if that was needed, but it looked golden brown when done). I had to cook it about 15 min. extra to get the golden brown color, so allow enough time.  I was concerned that the salmon would be overcooked, but it was still moist and flaky.  This recipe makes more than what it says, at least enough for 8 - 10 people.",

I followed the recipe and cooked it 15 minutes longer then the recipe calls for and the pastry still was not fully cooked and I used the suggestions of others and rolled it out to be a little thinner. Not sure why it didn't cook all the way through. It looked done on the outside and everything else was done but the pastry was not. Sorry for the bad review...",
