I sauteed the onions and peppers in a small amount of olive oil for a few minutes, before adding the stock and other ingredients.I substituted frozen baby lima beans for green beans. I had fresh basil from the garden available and used about 1/2 cup of chopped basil along with about 4 medium sized roma/plum tomatoes (chopped) and added that to the corn. I did not bother with pesto sauce since I added the ingredients directly into the soup at the end.",
