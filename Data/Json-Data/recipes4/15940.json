I wasn't sure how the flavors were gonna go together but they were great. I decided to only cut my mushrooms in 1/2 because they were on the smaller side. We ate these as is but they would make a great addition to a salad or on a anti-pasta platter. I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
