                "reviewBody": "Very good but my suggestion as to why they may not turn out well...make sure that the enchiladas and wrapped tightly and that the egg mixture almost covers over them completely.  If there is too much tortilla sticking out, they will burn on top as previous complaints have stated, while the inside tastes just fine.  The first time I made this recipe, the top of my tortillas didn't burn but got semi-hard after cooking.  They were still good enough for me to try again and the second time, after making sure that it was mostly covered with the egg mixture, they turned out REALLY GOOD.  I also added more cheese in the mixture. This is a good recipe but it is one that takes practice to make perfect.  Hopefully, readers will take this suggestion into account and try them.  They are worth it and my family now requests them regularly.  (I even made them for dinner once and used a variety of mexican toppings to complete the meal).",

EVERYONE loved it.\r\nWe had a birthday party and had the family over for brunch.  \r\nI found this recipe when I was looking for something different to make.  We all love breakfast burritos and thought this would be good.  I was getting tired of the same old breakfast casseroles.\r\nI used some ideas that some of your other users had.  I added 1 Tbl of green chilis AND jalapenos into the ham mixture.  I did not want to use too much in case it got too hot. \r\nI used a mixture of cheese I found (Kraft) that was cheddar and jack cheese with jalapeno mixed in.  I also used red pepper along with the green.  I made sure I poured the egg mixture over all the enchiladas so they were completly wet. I covered them with foil and cooked them for 50 minutes.  I removed the foil and sprinkled the top with more cheese and put them back in the oven without the foil until the cheese melted and bubbled.\r\nI served them with sour cream, salsa, the left over jalepenos and green chilis - Bacon, sausage and hash browns on the side.",

I also added one more egg, salt and pepper, and another cup of cheese on top of the casserole.  I baked for 45 min covered with foil, removed the foil for 15 more minutes.  When the casserole came out of the oven, I sprinkled with more green onions and dollops of Pace Picante Sauce.  It looked beautiful with all the different colors and tasted divine!

I have served this a few tmes, and have always found that  about 3/4 of one enchilada satisfies an adult.  Because dish is quite dense, serve it with something light, like a fruit salad.  Lastly, because the dish is covered in cheese before baking, you will have great trouble finding each of the enchiladas when you are ready to serve.  Avoid this problem by marking the location of each enchilada with toothpicks before baking.",

I was so glad that I could prepare it the night before and I did incorporate many of the suggestions others gave.  I used Jimmy Dean sausage and added chli powder while it cooked.  I mixed in chopped green onion, chopped bell pepper and a can of green chilis (a must). I used both cheddar and Kraft Mexican cheddar jack cheese in the tortillas.  To the egg mixture I added 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder, chili powder, salt, pepper, cumin and cilantro along with the hot pepper sauce. I sprinkled some of the sausage mix around the tortillas and after it set over night I did add a bit more egg/milk/cream mix to the top with a sprinkle of cheese.  I covered with foil while it cooked and had no problems. This tasted fantastic with salsa and sour cream and the leftovers were great re-heated.  When I made this a third time I did find that using less than 6 eggs and too much cheese made the consistency a little too runny/gooey for my taste. Overall a great find!",
