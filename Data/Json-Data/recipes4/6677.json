I boiled the chicken with seasoning salt made of salt, garlic & celery, so in place of the chicken broth, I used the broth from the chicken & added one bouillon cube.  I used cornbread stuffing, one can of cream of chicken & one can of cream of mushroom,  1/2 c of butter,  & 3/4 c sour cream (because that's all I had) & maybe a couple tablespoons of milk, because the mixture seemed a little dry.  Next time I will have enough sour cream because I think that would've made a difference.  I also sprinkled a little black pepper too.  I will definitely make this again.  I am a big stuffing lover!!...    \n5/1/16.. I cut back on the chicken & added thinly sliced ham...delicious!",

I actually usually 'shun' canned creamed soups, just because I prefer made from scratch sauces. But, I was quite surprised at the 'tastiness' of the mixture - cream soup and mayonnaise is also good, surprisingly. I only use one can of soup to each cup of sour cream (or mayonnaise) and it comes out great.",
