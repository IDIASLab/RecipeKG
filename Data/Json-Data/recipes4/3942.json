I was a little dubious myself and only chose this recipe because I could make it work with what I had on hand. My changes were modest: I didn't have any green onions garlic jalapenos or sour cream so I substituted with regular onions garlic powder bottled hot sauce and plain yogurt. I didn't have enough cornmeal so I wound up using a cornmeal/flour mix. I liked these a lot and think they would be even better if I hadn't made so many substitutions. I didn't make a sauce but next time I will. I'll probably try the cilantro-lime mayonnaise from the crab and noodle cakes with cilantro lime dressing on this site.",

I didn't have cornmeal so I used seasoned bread crumbs added more garlic & used frozen shredded zucchini from the summer crop. When using frozen zucchini I used 2 cups - it thaws & juices seep out reducing down to 1 C. Don't let the jalapenos scare you off. My kids didn't know they were in there and asked for thirds. The recipe makes enough for us to eat two meals & great for leftovers. I'm going to try and sub out salmon next time for the tuna.",

The tuna cakes turned out to be very delicous even though I didn't include the green onions jalapeno peppers cottage cheese sour cream lime juice or cornmeal. I did add about 3 tsps of lemonade and 1 shredded carrot. I was worried that they would turn out dry because of the missing ingredients but that wasn't the case at all! I had to bake them slightly longer added about 10 mins to the bake time. Thanks for the recipe!",

I rough chopped those veggies and then put them in my small food processor. I used panko vs bread crumbs for both the filling and for dipping. I was surprised how good the lime was in this. I made huge patties which turned out crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. I made a mayo sour cream and lime sauce w/ fresh chives parsley and cilantro. Also added kosher salt and fresh pepper and just a tiny bit of basil. My family loved this sauce along w/ the tuna cakes. I did have to cook mine about 20 minutes longer then stated but as I said they were huge. No left-overs....Darn. lol. Enjoy and make your own sauce with these. It's great!",
