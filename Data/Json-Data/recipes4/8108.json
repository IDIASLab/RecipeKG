It makes a huge difference because stock was chicken bones cooked with veggies and herbs. Broth is just chicken bones boiled in water and salt. You found it nearly tasteless because you used broth. I make this without added salt, pepper, herbs, or spices in order to use different flavors for different recipes. This is only your base - experiment and change it up however you like!",
