I didn't have Splenda so I used a Sweet n' Low packet and just sprinkled it stirred and tasted until it was sweet enough for my taste. For some reason the grocery store was out of coleslaw mix so I just shredded a small head of cabbage and carrots and I omitted the sunflower seeds because I didn't have them but I'm sure they would have added another element of delicious crunch. I think I'll be making this on a weekly basis we had it with stir fry but it would make a great snacking salad too! Thank you so much!",
