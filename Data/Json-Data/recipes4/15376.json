I made half a recipe and it cooked much faster than 6 hours so you may want to start checking on it early. Next time I probably will double the raisins and even use golden raisins for a little more eye-appealing presentation (the dark raisins sort of look like kidney or black beans in the oatmeal). I'll most likely add more pineapple as that flavor was crazy good in this. IMO the spices are spot on. I served this with a dollop of honey greek yogurt and a sprinkle of chopped walnuts. I portioned out what I made today into freezer containers so this should make for a healthy/nutritional/fast breakfast reheated in the microwave. Thanks DebbiKat for a recipe that makes the slow cooker a star (and honestly I'm not a slow cooker fan).",

I use a full 20oz can of crushed pineapple, draining the juice, but measure it and use as part of the water.  Have tried different kinds and amounts of sweetener, but finally decided it does not need any sweetener.  I have never cared for hot cereal, but this recipe has changed that!  This freezes very well in individual containers.  Just pop one in the microwave, and your meal is ready!  I just have to comment on some of the negative feedback:  For those who thought it was not sweet enough, I guess they must have been using it for a dessert, not a healthy breakfast (plus if you really want all that added sugar it's pretty easy to add more at the table).  For those who ended up with too much water, check to make sure you were using STEEL CUT oats.  For the ones that said the matchstick carrots didn't cook, the recipe calls for SHREDDED carrots (which you can do yourself!)  I have made this several times since finding the recipe, and it has always cooked perfectly!",

Not eggs, sweet rolls or a big sandwich, OATMEAL! Lol!! I halved this and used a 5 qt slow cooker. It only took about 3 hours. I used the entire can of pineapple, didn't drain it and the full amount of raisins. I don't know what the sugar equivalent of the sugar substitute would be so I just added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead. It was just right, not too sweet. I keep this in containers in the frig, put what I want in a bowl, add milk and microwave a 1 1/2 minutes. Thank you! Great, fun recipe. I know my husband will request it often and I am happy to make for him!!",

I initially thought the amount of water (10cupes?) seemed a bit much esp if you include the applesauce but since I'd never cooked with steel cut oats I figured it'll \"drink\" all the water up and be more like an oatmeal when done I was wrong. After letting it cook for 6 hours (still looked like brown water in a crockpot) I cooked it for another 2 on low.. still watery and I tasted it this morning (let it cook over night) it was a soupy-watery mess with probably about 3 cups of liquid still left over. I had to dredge out the \"oatmeal\" from the bottom of the crockpot. All that water didn't get absorbed or cook down.. its watery oatmeal. Smells great but its not appealing at all. Was kinda hoping this would be the chance I'd get over my distaste for oatmeal with something yummy. I'll keep searching.",

The only other time I've made steel cut oats was with a recipe from this site (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/slow-cooker-oats/detail.aspx). I compared the water called for in this recipe to the previous link and the ratio of water to oats was much greater (probably why people were getting really watery oats.) Here's what I did that didn't really modify the recipe and I was successful: I only made 1/2 a batch so I started with 3 cups of water instead of 5. I could only find matchstick carrots at the store so I put them in my food processor before adding to the crockpot (complaints about crunchy carrots in reviews). When they were done the carrots were still pretty crunchy but overnight in the fridge mellowed them out a bit before I had a bowl for breakfast. I checked on the oats hourly and after about 4 hours I added 1 cup more water. They were done in about 5 hours... That's all I did and it worked great. Even though this is a slow cooker recipe I still made sure I was home at night so I could check it... Now I know what works for my crockpot!",
