My tip for moisture reduction - salt your zuchinni slices, then put in the oven at 350F for about 10 minutes (start to turn brown). Pull them out, pat with paper towels, leave on paper towels until ready to put in lasagna.  This removes almost all of the water from them. Personally, I like to let the juices from my meat add moisture to my lasagna rather than the veggies juice, so that's why I really drain them well.  very good, very healthy!",

The best solution is to serve the dish with a good bread to sop up the juice!  Great dish for large group, or for reheating during the week in a busy household. It gets better every meal because the flavors continue to meld.  Just serve it with a different side each night like green beans, salad.  Excellent dish!",

Took the advice of another reviewer & baked the zucchini at 350 for 12 minutes with just 1 tsp of salt sprinkled on it. Don't forget the cooking spray or they stick!\nInstead of making my own sauce, I just used spaghetti sauce. I also used chicken Italian sausage instead of ground beef.\nAdded the spinach, pepper & herbs (basil & oregano) to the ricotta cheese mixture instead of separately.  Added a layer of chopped broccoli & cauliflower and some shredded carrot to the whole mix. (I wanted lots of veggies!)\nOnly used one cup total of Mozzarella cheese, half in the middle with all the veggies & cheese and the other half on top.  Also only used about 1/2 of a cup of Parmesan for the top.  Was not overly watery for me.  A big helping point for that I think is drying out the zucchini a bit in the oven and making sure you do allow it to rest for that 15 minutes after baking.  The veggies will soak back up some of those juices.  Delicious! My oldest son & husband ate 3 pieces each!",

What's with the green pepper? This isn't chili. Why sauce and paste? How about good Redpack crushed tomatoes?) I did use salted zucchini, but I didn't add the spinach or mushrooms, because I didn't have them on hand. BUT..key points: the spinach is sure to be watery as they prepare it. Try using a bag of frozen spinach, and cook it in a bowl in the microwave WITHOUT any added water. The sliced mushrooms are going to be slithery and wet if not cooked first. Use a skillet with 1T olive oil and 2T butter over fairly high heat: they will exude their moisture and then brown nicely. Next time, I'm going to sear each side of the zucchini slices in olive oil after salting and before assembling.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was excellent, and we will definitely make it more often. I used the slicing side of a cheese grater to get really thin slices of the zucchini, and then after salting and draining them I blotted them with a paper towel. As others suggested, I also left out the water from the sauce, and had no problems with too much moisture in the lasagna. I also followed the suggestion to put garlic into the sauce, along with a bit of salt and triple the basil (we had a lot of fresh basil to use). I thought the frozen spinach was strong, so I might try fresh spinach next time. We loved the result!",
