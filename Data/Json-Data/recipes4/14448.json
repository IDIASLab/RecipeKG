I also made a mistake the last time and opened a can of plum tomatoes before realizing I was supposed to use tomato paste instead.  So I blended the tomatoes up with my hand blender, added the spices as directed and then added 2 Tbs of Bulgar wheat to the meat and tomato sauce, cooked an additional 15 min and it came out great.
