It says half should be used to grease the pan...that's quite a lot.\n\nI used 1/4 cup to melt into the marshmallows then pressed out the squares onto parchment so I didn't use the other butter called for.  Turned out perfect.  I also always just add a generous pinch of salt to take a little of the sweetness and I let the butter brown just slightly to give them a hint of a caramel flavor.  Delicious!",
