I cooked them in a pan on top of the stove w/a little butter (about 7 minutes). Once one side was done, I flipped the pieces over and added the broth/honey/jalapeno/lime juice sauce and cooked it w/the lid on for for about 6 minutes. It came out so flavorful, so moist and smelled heavenly! Next time I would double the sauce as everyone wanted more to pour over their jasmine rice. Don't be nervous about all the cinnamon- it's fabulous :-)",

I followed the recipe to the t except I didn't baste it during the baking time I just poured the marinade in the pan and let it bake for 30 mins. I also left out the cinnamon because we don't like cinnamon in our meats! I only used 2 chicken breast and I must say if the recipe calls for a whole chicken you'll need more seasoning than what it calls for. I served these over mashed potatoes (the liquid ladled over them) and with corn it was a wonderful southwestern meal! And it's quick too great meal for those busy work nights! Note: I would suggest to sear the chicken first then in the same pan add the broth and scrape up the bits so no flavor is lost.",

Instead it just did not add any flavor. - So after that fail I tried the recipe again this time as a fajita.
