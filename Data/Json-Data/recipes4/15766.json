I had more \"filling\" than my 2 medium-sized zucchini could accommodate, so I greased a small casserole dish and put the excess filling in it and baked it, too.  Would highly recommend this recipe.

I didn't have access to any extra large zucchinis so I bought 3 medium sized ones about 8\"-10\" long. I only ended up using about half the meat mixture so I definitely could have used a few more zucchinis probably 6 total. The only suggestion I'd make is to lower the heat to 400F as the meat mixture started burning towards the end. Also the bread crumbs and mozzarella weren't really combining well so I'd just put them on separately. The mint really makes this dish. I'm looking forward to making this for company! Thanks another great recipe Larry!",
