I used dried rosemary instead of fresh since I have quite a bit of it in my cupboards.  Also I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon to cut down on some of the calories and fat.  The turkey bacon provided a very nice flavor.  I prepped the first part of the ingredients in my cast iron skillet, while heating the broth in my crockpot on high.  Once my veggies were softened I transferred the peas and the veggies into the crockpot on high for about an hour and then I turned it down on low to allow it to simmer.  This approach might work for someone who doesn't have a lot of free time or works all day and would like to have the soup ready for dinner.  Just do the prep work and soften the veggies on the stove top and allow the soup to cook all day on low (I kept it on high because I wanted to see how it would turn out).",
