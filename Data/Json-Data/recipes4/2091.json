I have NEVER understood why recipes tell you to bread and fry the chicken and then stick it back into the sauce just to lose the crunchy coating. DO NOT do it... either skip the flour (as another review suggested) or cook the chicken all the way (possibly in another pan). The recipe calls for two onions; you can get by with just one medium to large onion. Before adding the ONE onion cook/fry the bacon first then add the onion. The bacon will never get crispy if you cook it with the onion. Add the garlic at the end to avoid getting a bitter taste. Feel free to add more herbs or spices (another review suggested peppers) to bring in more flavor.",
