I made these balls to practice for the upcoming Holiday, and they came out great!  Use salted water on your hands to keep the dough from sticking to them, and drop the balls into the broth with a slotted spoon.  I also used the freezer to get the dough ready faster.  It took about an hour.  I added some veggies to the soup.  My Jewish mother-in-law even said they were some of the best she's ever had.  I'm not sure if this recipe is kosher or not, but it's great either way.",
