But the flavor was so rich - we served it with wild rice on the side and every drop of the sauce went!  I also would think about making more sauce - we made it with 4 chops for 4 people and it was barely enough sauce so I might think about doubling it next time around, it was so good!\n\nAdded note:  since my initial review, I decided to retry with sherry instead of white wine.  wow!  a really winner there too!  and try it with chicken as well!! you just can't go wrong with this.  you might also try adding the mushrooms with the white wine and chops - they take on the wine flavor and are even more yummy.  and i always double the sauce so there is no fighting at the table :)",

I added a can of beef broth and simmered for about 6 minutes. I removed the meat and strained the broth into another sauce pan. I sauted fresh mushrooms in a litle butter - returned the beef broth to the pan with 1 cup of heavy cream and a little Marsala wine. I cooked it until it reduced a little and thickened. This sauce is wonderfull. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and a veggie.",

The only thing I recommend is doubling the sauce and adding some garlic (I love garlic and put it in everything! ). Second, and the main reason I am commenting: I get so aggravated when people rate a recipe that they have completely changed. I saw someone on here who gave the recipe 3 stars and said the sauce just didn't knock their socks off and they won't be making again. They stated in their comment that they used chicken broth instead of wine, and half and half instead of heavy cream, AND they also added sour cream and flour to the sauce. Well no wonder it didn't knock your socks off! You completely changed the recipe! I'm sorry, but if you're going to alter a recipe that much, you shouldn't be rating it. Make the recipe as stated the first time (adding more/less seasoning to your taste is fine), rate it, and then alter away the next time you make it!! Sorry- I'm done ranting now. This recipe rocks!
