The best slow cooker recipe yet. \n\nMy modifications: \n\nAdded 1/2 pound sliced mushrooms, dry fried at high heat just after meat was removed and just before onions were browned. \n\n\nUsed same volume of potatoes but cut them in to halves and added to crock pot with browned onions, meat and carrots. \n\nCooked on low for 8 hours - came out perfect, and much less hassle \n\nLeft off puff pastry.
