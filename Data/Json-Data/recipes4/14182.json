I would recommend frying them a little longer than 1 minute on each side--they came out a little bit cool, so I threw them in for another minute per side.  If you end up going with the full 3 cups of water, it will take a while to boil down, but it is totally worth the wait.  Will definitely be making again.",

BIG HIT with the men in my house!  thank you for the recipe i loved it!!!!",
