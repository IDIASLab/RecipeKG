We had about 4 ounces of halibut each.  I used about 2/3 cup of buttermilk and only one egg.  I used about a teaspoon of melted butter for each fillet and if I weren't watching my health I would have used more, but 1 teaspoon each was enough.  I used Triscut Rye/Caraway crackers.  I wasn't sure that the caraway would be a good mix for the fish.  Oh my goodness....my first bite I thought wow this would be great on chicken and then I had another bite and I have to say the flavors really meshed for us.  I will be using this basics of this recipe for many other recipes for both fish and chicken.  Thanks!!!! Plain Ole Bob and Thank you for your service too, Sir!",
