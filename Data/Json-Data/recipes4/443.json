I was struggling to choose a recipe, so I decided to try three different pesto recipes from this site.  In A-typical allrecipes fashion I actually stuck exactly to each recipe so that we could truly judge them fairly.  The recipes were Easy Pesto by Rebecca Jane Thompson, Pesto Sauce by Sara, and Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto by FuzzyGreenMonkey.  My favorite was Easy Pesto.  It had a nice nutty flavor because of the toasted almonds.  It's also nice if you don't have much basil on hand because it uses half as much as the other recipes.  My husband liked Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto the best, it was my close second.  The parmesan cheese and pine nuts really make that recipe.  We both agreed that by far our least favorite was Pesto Sauce.  It was very bland compared to the other two.  I would attribute that to the 1 1/2 cups of walnuts.  I would not recommend that recipe at all.  It was a fun experiment and the other two recipes will go into my permanant file.",

As long as there is a nut basil olive oil garlic parmesan cheese and a bit of lemon it is to die for. The different nuts make whole different tastes personally I use walnut because they are so much cheaper. Roasting any nut first in a dry skillet makes the taste even better. I also like to subsitute argula for the basil and asiago cheese on occasion for a different taste. Lemon basil is good but sweet basil is the herb leaf that is typically used in pesto sauces. You can make this with less oil too and make it a bit better for you- but the extra oil makes it that much smoother. Thanks for the good recipe Sara.",

I used toasted pine nuts instead of walnuts. Expensive but worth it. I also added fresh parmesan and the juice of 1/2 a lemon. I'll definitely make this again. I was concerned about the fat and calorie content as listed on the recipe but when I made this I came out with around 2 cups of pesto. The recipe says 4 servings but this pesto is extremely rich. On a smaller-sized bowl of pasta I used like 2 spoonfuls of the sauce - not 1/2 cup - so I doubt I consumed anywhere near the fat and calorie content that was listed.",
