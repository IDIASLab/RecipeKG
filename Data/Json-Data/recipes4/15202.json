It was just perfect flavor. While marinading I flipped the chops about every half hour and spooned the marinade on top of the exposed side of meat and made sure the spices and garlic sat on the meat to really get in there. I also brushed the meat with the leftover marinade making sure to get the spices and garlic in the meat until the last couple flips. Adjust your grilling time depending on the thickness of your meat. Ours were really thick chops so it took much longer then the recipe stated. Using a digital meat thermometer set to 'Pork' Well Done' helps tremendously to make sure they are not only done (for safety reasons) but you get them off while they are still juicy and tender. These were so juicy and tender!!!! Thanks so much for sharing!  Carren",
