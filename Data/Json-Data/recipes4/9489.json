My cake tastes good, but it's now soaked.\nI would consider making some significant adjustments to the quanitities of ingredients used if you're hoping for something thicker (like no water and doubling the chocolate).  Chilling overnight before using made little difference.",

If you need sweeter I would add a little sugar while melting the chocolate. For those who said it was bitter or not the right consistency, they need to read the label to make sure they are using sweetened condensed milk, NOT Evaporated milk. I think some people don't realize they are different. Evaporated milk is just that, thick milk, not sweetened. This is very good on brownies!",

I added an extra ounce or 2 (don't remember) of chocolate. I let it cool completely before spreading it over the cake and it was perfect, just as frosting should be! And OMG it tasted HEAVENLY.   I tried to stay more to the original recipe recently by adding less butter, but it wasn't as good and was more runny. To add the butter, I chopped it up into small pieces and melted it little by little into the pot after the chocolate. I'm sure it's very unhealthy but who cares, it taste like the ambrosia of the gods that way.",

The recipe states to cook till thick but condensed mik and melted chips are already thick? So I cooked it for 10 minutes and noticed it sticking to the sides of the pan better so I figured it was done. After it completely cooled and I had added the vanilla, what was on the spoon stuck pretty good so I spread it over the cake which had already cooled. The frosting wasn't as thick as what was on the spoon or the sides of the pan since it spread well but kept oozing about 1/2\" past the sides of the cake. Dont get me wrong. This is the best fudgy frosting I have tried and it tasted great with my dark chocolate cake. I would like to get it thicker without having to add powdered sugar since that is why I loved this recipe.",

Not sickeningly sweet but it's nice and rich.\n\nSince I was not able to find bittersweet chocolate, I used normal cooking chocolate instead and add more than what the recipe required (about 3-4 rows of the chocolate bar). If you prefer the chocolate to be less sweet and more chocolatey, add some powdered cocoa. \n\nThis will definitely be THE chocolate frosting to use when I do my next batch of cupcakes.

I ended up making the following revisions: I doubled the chocolate and used 72% cacao baking chocolate.  I mixed in about a tablespoon of corn starch with the chocolate and condensed milk.  I left out the water altogether.  The result was a slightly thicker frosting which spread on the cake better.  I  refrigerated the cake after I frosted it. I would still say this is more of an icing, but its easily the most delicious one I have had in a while! ",
