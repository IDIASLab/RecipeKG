Will be making for Christmas dinner this year for the non glutens in my family;-) TY",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is great. I think the spice mixture was aiming more for Stove Top stuffing instead of chicken Rice-a-Roni but since rice doesn't pick up the flavors as strongly as bread the flavor is unlike either one as it is delightfully mild and savory. This is how a side dish should be supporting but not overpowering - a definite keeper. I made two minor substitutions: real long grain rice with enough water to cook it 1.5 cups water to 1 cup rice ratio plus an additional 1/4 cup water on top for the dry ingredients; and fresh celery instead of flakes because that's all I had. You can sub fresh finely minced celery for flakes at a 2 Tb to 1 tsp ratio. Mixed everything together from the start in a microwave-safe covered container and zapped it on high for 12 minutes (700 watt micro) then let it stand for 5 minutes. Heavenly as a side for chicken & gravy! Thank you thank you. Just what I was looking for.",
