I will keep this recipe in rotation. Thanks for sharing!",

I made it just as stated except I used fresh mild green chilis omitted the bouillon to avoid MSG and just added some salt to substitute. I served it with homemade steak and black bean tostadas and fresh salsa lettuce and tomato from the garden. I did put the cilantro in the blender because I didn't see the edit in the reviews and it turned out great. The rice stayed white mixed with green flecks. Maybe because I added the cilantro mix after most of the liquid had been absorbed by the rice just before serving by oversight. I made this recipe a second time to serve a chicken dish made with a Southwest sauce and tortilla strips. I wanted the chicken flavor that the bouillon in the original recipe would provide but again wanted to avoid the preservatives and MSG so I used some defrosted chicken broth from my freezer in place of the water and added a bit of salt. Thank you BCOLLINS1 we love this recipe!",
