You will definitely need more than one teaspoon of oil to coat your pan otherwise your potatoes will likely stick.  First spray your pan with non-stick cooking spray and then pour in enough oil to coat the pan.  When I make these I make half of this recipe in a 10\" cast iron skillet.   Even though I don't measure,  I'd say I use about one tablespoon of oil to coat my pan.  I hope this helps.",

I chopped the potatoes (husband's personal preference) and simply mixed with the cheese and spices, and spread onto baking pan.  Per the instructions, I roasted for 20 minutes, stirred them and continued roasting for additional 20 minutes.  They were absolutely delicious and we all (4) enjoyed them!

I saw on another recipe (and it works) that if you blast the potatoes at 450 degrees for 20 mintues and then turn down stove to 350 degrees for the next 15 -20 minutes, you get a nice crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, roasted potato. I also spray my pans/oil my pans, dump the pototoes and whatever seasonings in the pan and toss the potatoes around it in it. Potatoes never stick,you never lose any of the seasonings and one less bowl to wash.",

I used white potatoes, sprayed the cookie sheet with cooking spray, put one tablespoon of cooking oil on the cookie sheet, sliced my potatoes (I used 4 potatoes) in quarter slices, drizzled them with the cooking oil, and then instead of tossing the seasoning/cheese mix with them in the bowl, I spooned a about a 1/2 teaspoon of the mixture directly on the cut side of the potato and spread it around before placing them cut side down on the cookie sheet.  For me this was a lot easier and ensured that they had a nice thick coating on them because when I tried tossing it with them in the bowl the mixture didn't stick well.  I roasted them in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes and flipped them and cooked them for another 15 minutes.  They turned out beautifully browned and crispy and soft and delicious on the inside.  Next time I will decrease the salt a bit because they were a tad bit too salty but the sour cream that we dipped them in helped out with that problem.  Oh and I also doubled the seasoning/cheese mixture since the amount in the recipe was not enough probably since my potatoes were quartered instead of just cut in half.  I will make this recipe again and again.  My kids loved them and my son was disappointed when he saw that there weren't any leftovers.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe Bellepepper!!  :)",

It removes the starch from the potatoes and insures that the inside will be soft with a crunchy outside. After draining and dying them I put them in a gallon freezer bag and drizzled in the oil to coat, then dipped them in the parm. mixture. I lined the baking pan with parchment paper which made clean up a breeze! Started them out on 350 degrees and finished them on 400. They were AMAZING!!!",
