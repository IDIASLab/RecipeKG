I would highly suggest seasoning the pork chops with salt and pepper as you're browning them, because although the sauce is flavorful enough, the chops themselves were on the bland side. Also, my chops turned out dry and I don't know if this was due to the long simmering time or what. On the plus side, this recipe is easy and presents nicely.",

There just isn't enough sauce and adding water dilutes it so use more tomatoes, about double the amount.  The cook time is way too much.  I seared 2 mins on each side.  They should be brown but not fully cooked.  Simmered for 15 mins, not 45 and another 5 after adding the mushrooms and bell pepper.  Added more mushrooms to make it a whole meal so I didn't have to make a side of veggies.  Granted, if you use really thick chops, you may want to simmer them longer but I would't suggest 45 mins.  I also throw in some red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  Not necessary because the sauce is delicious but I wanted some spice.",

I used a red pepper but otherwise I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. The sauce was so good it might be good as a pasta sauce on it's own and I will defiantly try this with chicken.
