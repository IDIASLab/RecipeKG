FOR NO MESS - I put the flour mix into a big resealable bag, throw all my onion slices in and shake really well until they're all coated. Then take the onions out, add the milk/egg to the bag and stir well. Add the onions a handful at a time, seal bag and mush the bag until all slices are coated, take out with tongs and put on wire rack over foil or wax paper...then put my Panko breadcrumbs into a big tupperware bowl, add the onions a handful at a time (with tongs), put the lid on and shake shake shake.  Put the onions from the bowl directly into the hot oil with clean tongs, woo-hoo no mess!!!",

I floured them with an extra seasoning of garlic powder, paprika, battered them and then placed them in a shallow container with lots of crumbs. To save time I just placed the lid on the container and shook vigorously. It coated them in crumbs very well, alot better than using your fingers as all the places the breadcrumbs fall off because of your fingers weren't a problem. I mean I just don't have the time to coat one by one and this method worked great. I put them in the fridge ready for dinner and still have lots left uncooked which I will fry up tomorrow night.",

Add flour to a bowl with 1/4 cup of corn starch(forget the baking powder)this lighten up the gluten. Add  1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/8  tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp garlic powder to flour.  Pour off buttermilk and add if needed to make one cup, set aside.  Dredge onion rings into flour and set on cookie rack, now add buttermilk to flour and 2 tablespoon of instant potatos.  Let mixture sit for 10 mins, the potatos will thicken batter. Dip onion rings in batter and then into Panko bread crumbs not reg, this makes them so incredibly crunchy you won't believe it.  Put onion rings on a cooling rack to dry for at least 10 mins.  Drying keeps the batter/Panko on better when cooked and less greasy.   Deep fry after oil has reached 350 degrees, flipping over after couple mins until golden brown.  Salt right after they come out of oil.  Do not salt batter as it makes the onions sweat and batter will fall off.",

It's always easier to throw out extra batter than not have enough.  I also added the following to the batter:  Garlic powder, dried parsley, a pinch of cayenne, black pepper, and some paprika.

Breaded onion rings are so hard to find at restaurants now since there are so few old fashioned drive-ins left anymore. I will never have to lust after these again.

Next, I set wire racks over newspaper to put the rings after coating with the batter.   I used a covered pan for the breadcrumbs and shook the batter coated rings in there before laying them out on a piece of newspaper.   The fastest part was the actual frying - quick and easy in an electric skillet.  Served with the Blooming Onion Sauce from this site, there are a couple..we used the recipe that has mayonnaise as a base, but cut down on the horseradish by 1/2. Perfect companion to these excellent onion rings. Enjoy!  Edit - I made these again and they are still delicious. However, I got a new electric skillet and it didn't seem to get as hot as my old one so the onion rings took longer to cook. Next time I will do them on the stove. These are really excellent onion rings!",
