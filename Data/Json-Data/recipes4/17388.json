I did have issues with them melting before they browned enough but I'm gonna play around with it a bit and maybe freeze the cheese cubes first before coating and frying. The coating is so tasty and the combo w/ that and the creamy cheese is really fantastic. I will def be making these again YUM YUM YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing.:)",
