I didn\u2019t have all the ingredients on hand so I made a few modifications: used red onion (a few tbs because I didn\u2019t want the onion to be overpowering), used relish instead of pickles, used bacon bits instead of real bacon (they didn't stay crispy so I would suggest adding them just before serving or use real bacon!) and omitted the peas. There was a bit too much dressing, but it tastes just like potato salad. I wasn\u2019t expecting this salad to be spectacular, but I was nicely surprised.
