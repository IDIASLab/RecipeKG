I added thinly sliced green onions and lots of chopped fresh basil to the meatballs, and used cow's milk romano cheese instead of parmesan, doubling the amount the recipe called for. I used yellow onion instead of shallot, lots of it, and sauteed until translucent and just barely starting to caramelize on the edges. I added lots of thickly sliced celery, too, and sweat it a little along with the carrots. To the broth, I added bay leaf, a little fennel seed, frozen chopped spinach, MSG, and wayyy more white wine than was called for, an entire bottle instead of 2 cups. Oak Leaf Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc is cheap and was very tasty, much better than salty cooking wine. We garnished the soup with chopped green onions.",
