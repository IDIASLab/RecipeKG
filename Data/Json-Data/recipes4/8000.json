I messed up my beef ratio of beef in tortillas and beef in sauce I\u2019d say a little more than half of the beef should go in the tortillas, I only made on pan of 8 burritos with these ingredients and had some sauce left over. I also added cheese in the burritos before I rolled it. Otherwise excited to make it again!",
