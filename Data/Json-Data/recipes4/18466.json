Then I blended them with a date for sweetness and a pitch of salt. I changed the water before blending wonder if this changes anything about the flavour. I used a very fine sieve to strain the milk. I added the milk to my morning coffee. It was creamy the colour is rich and the texture was almost similar to dairy milk. I'm likely to make it again.",
