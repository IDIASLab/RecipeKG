I take it pot-lucks and parties and it is ALWAYS the only dish that never has any leftovers! I've made it with ham and also with sliced deli turkey and have had rave reviews both ways. The only change I've made is to add about 1 cup of sour cream and different kinds and bigger amounts of shredded cheeses about 4 cups. Monterey Jack/Colby mix works really well with the turkey. I'm making it again this weekend and I'm going to try shaved roast beef this time with Mozzarella cheese. Two BIG thumbs up to Anne for making me look like a genius!!",
