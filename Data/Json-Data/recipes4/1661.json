This is not a Italian base sauce, each time you correct the sauce by adding other ingredients you further complicate the taste of the sauce.  In otherwords, your breaking down the original sauce.  This sauce as in the original recipe is a good tangy sauce that has muliple uses.\nThe Italian base tomato sauce is plum tomatoes, with 4 cloves garlic, blend and simmer for 30 minutes.  The last 10 minutes add a whole stem of fresh basil and simmer the remaining 10 minutes.  Then pull the basil out of the sauce, remove from heat and let it cool.  Store for furture use.  Then when you need a sauce for spaghetti, or as a sauce for meat like Chicken Parmesan or stuffed shell, you seasn the sauce to the dish.\nGood taste sauce, I'll use it for shell and chicken parmesan.",

Excellent! We used it for pasta, then the next night for a spicy Chicken Parm.

I also am lucky because in Tucson, AZ, spring is Heirloom Tomato season, so I used my own fresh 12 tomatoes from the garden. For this recipe, I used a Vidalia Sweet onion and 10 fresh garlic cloves (see photo!), all minced very fine and sauteed in 1 Tof EVOO; when they were translucent after 5-7 minutes, added diced zucchini and sauteed all another 5 minutes with lid on low. Added all to the peeled, seeded and crushed tomatoes in the slow cooker on low...and went to bed! In the A.M., the juices had cooked off; it was a very rich, thick and chunky sauce. THEN I added spices but absolutely no cayenne. Wanted to keep it strictly tomato sauce for pasta; cayenne is too weird for us, but to each their own! What I DID add was garlic powder, fresh crushed oregano and fresh basil, 1 tsp. garlic salt and 1 tsp. pepper and let it sit on low for another hour. THEN...I tasted it. NOW is the time to really hone down the flavors to make this your very own concoction, with dried herbs, spices and especially if it needs salt. Ended up adding more salt (about two teaspoons total for the recipe), granulated garlic (this is normal for me, can't have too much garlic), onion powder, dried oregano, thyme, basil and ahem, some cumin. \nI love how this basic recipe lets me experiment!\nEvery time different AND zesty! Thanks, Michele!",

I've had a much better result using canned tomato sauce.  The flavor and consistency is just off but I can't really determine exactly what needs to be done to fix it.  I used about 18 roma type tomatoes from my garden, used dry oregano and 1/2 cup of fresh chopped basil.  We don't like a hot pasta sauce so I omitted the cayenne altogether and used fresh ground pepper for the flavor. In addition I added about 1/4 cup dry sherry, 2 cans of chopped portobello mushrooms, extra garlic, and 2 bay leaves.  I pureed the sauce in my blender because my kids prefer a smooth sauce.  The 2nd time I made it I even added in a can of tomato paste and a can of tomato sauce, hoping to richen and improve the flavor but it didn't help much.  Just as a footnote this this, a trick I learned a while ago is that if the sauce tastes too acidic add 1 or 2 Tbsp. butter, mix it in and taste.  Add more if needed.  It should balance out the acidity.   Sugar also helps reduce acidity.",
