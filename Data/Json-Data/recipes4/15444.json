I then  chopped the bacon into smaller pieces.\nNext I added the onion to the same wok  stirring until it was  soft and splashed it with teriyaki sauce to my taste. stirred in   rice, chopped bacon, \nI microwaved a med. sized bag of mixed veggies and added it to the mix. \n I then added more teriyaki  sauce  and stirred it in a few seconds until the mixture was fully coated and hot\nRemoved the wok from the stove and served on plates and  added some salad Wonton salad strips to the tops of the serving for added crunch.\nQuick, no seasoning except the teriyaki and easy.\nThis is really good for halftime.",
