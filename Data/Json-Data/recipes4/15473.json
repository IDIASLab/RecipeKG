The onlly thing I did differently was I added in some sliced peppers when I sauted the onions.  I had an array of yellow, green, and orange peppers and decided they would be a nice addition to the dish.  I was right.  But, if I hadn't already had them on hand, it would have been just as good I am certain.  Oh, and I didn't have any cornstarch on hand, so I made a roux of 2 Tbsp. flour and 2 Tbsp canola oil to thicken the gravy...perfection!  \nThis was the perfect cold-night meal!  I will definitely be making this again and again!  \nOn another note...the photo I am submitting for this dish was taken AFTER we had already dug into our meal!  My bad...I forgot to take it beforehand ;-)    Update..I made this again today.  I used Lipton onion soup mix, 1/2 in the meat mixture and half in the broth.  I didn't change the amount of onions, in fact, I MIGHT have put more in than was called for ;-)   I also added a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce into the roux I made before adding in the broth.  It was AMAZING!   I had made a mushroom risotto to accompany it along with some frozen peas.  It was a huge hit in my house yet again!",

TIPS: I removed steaks from pan after browning - adding onions and mushrooms to saute. You can use one can of beef broth (14.5 oz) adding water to make the 16 ozs. Plenty of flavor. Then proceed with recipe as written.  Will make again soon.",

This steak had the same taste you want, only better and fresher and made from scratchiness. Not sure how to say that.... And the great things is that if you have fresh ground beef, then you probably have all the ingredients on hand. I took my first bite, and heard the ding ding ding ding from a game show. There's no need to read reviews to find ways to tweak the recipe. Cook it as is the first time; then do your own tweaks if your palette demands it.",

I dislike when people rate a recipe with so many changes that the original recipe is barely recognizable.  I did it as is with all the same ingredients and proportions.  HOWEVER the second time around, I felt that the recommendation in step #2 to remove the beef patties when they are browned, saut\u00e9 the onions and mushrooms, put back the patties and then proceed with the rest of step #2, had the best outcome.  The salt and pepper quantities might changes with the type of broth that you use (i.e. its sodium content) but the salt to pepper proportion was just right for this dish.",

My wife loved it and asked me to make it again, and she usually likes a different style of cooking.  I made it with venison, but it would be great with ground turkey or ground beef.  I served it with a spinach salad, mashed potatoes, and green beens for an old-fashioned, comfort-food, delicious dinner.  I did remove the steaks and saute the onions and mushrooms a little prior to returning them to the pan and adding the broth.  Note that you could substitute beef bouillon for the broth by adding 1 tablespoon or 1 cube and a cup of water for each cup of broth.  When I make it again, I may add a splash or two of worcestershire sauce, but the recipe was great as is.  Add more or less onions or mushrooms to suit your taste.  Double the gravy to have plenty for mashed potatoes.  It is excellent and doesn't require condensed soup like most of the other similar recipes on this site.\n\nUpdate (3 years after my first review):  I made this recipe with ground beef this time and was again pleased with the results.  I added a couple splashes of worcestershire sauce, but I followed the recipe other than that.  I read some of the negative reviews and noticed that some people complained about the consistency of the sauce - either complaining that it was too runny or jelly like.  When thickening the gravy, make sure to add the cornstarch mixture slowly while at a boil.  If your sauce was too runny, add a little ",
