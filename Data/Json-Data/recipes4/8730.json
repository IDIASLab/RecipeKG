It also had all the ingredients we love. Anyway as you can tell by my 5 rating we loved it!!! I have only made this once but am planning on making it again this week. It was super easy to put together because most of the ingredients are from a can which I was a bit skeptical about. However this recipe tasted anything but like it was from a can! Like another review I too used the diced green chilies instead of the jalapenos. It had the perfect amount of spice to sweetness. It is super chunky and I had my doubts about a couple of my kids eating it when I added the corn but they all raved about it and have requested it several times since. I tasted it when I was simmering and immediately fell in love! Of course upon seeing my reaction each of the kids wanted a preview taste too and then no one could wait for the noodles to finish cooking so we could eat! This is definitely a keeper and will be added to our family recipe box for good! I would have given this a 5 if that was an option!!",

Also subbed leftover roasted chicken breast for the chicken tenders - green chilies and some crushed red pepper flakes for the jalepenos (daughter is allergic) and omitted the olives. We really liked the corn. Lovcd finding a recipe that I can just throw together on a busy night. Thanks!",

I used a canned chicken breast from Costco (12.5 oz.) instead of the tenderloins spaghetti sauce with meat Red Gold canned tomatoes with green chiles no jalapenos no olives (yuck) no onion powder using a leftover half cup of chopped onions instead. I had about half can of black beans leftover so I threw those in. And I used regular thin spaghetti as I didn't have any angelhair. It was a quick and easy recipe to make and my picky eater even liked it! Had just the right amount of spicyness for the kids. Thanks for the recipe!",

I used diced green peppers instead of the jalepenos and 3 chicken breasts I cut into strips and seasoned with garlic salt. I also didn't have any diced tomatoes so I diced 3 small tomatoes and used a small can of tomatoe sauce in place of that. Used frozen corn instead of a can of corn. As I do with my regular spaghetti sauce I always add a little bit of baking soda to cut the acidity and a teaspoon or two of sugar. Its cooking now and I anticipate it to be very good!",
