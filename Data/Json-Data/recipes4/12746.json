In addition to her iron supplement I looked up on the internet other iron rich foods that I could make for her. Liver is right up there at the top and I found this recipe. OMG it is good! The three textures of onion (boiled fried and raw) plus the hard boiled eggs add tons to the texture and flavor. Reminds me of when we used to get really good chopped chicken livers from the Jewish deli as a kid. Now I make it all the time. It's so easy! Thanks for sharing AJ.",

I decided to follow the recipe exactly and was blown away by how great it came out. I used pulse on the food processor resulting in a great consistency. It wasn't too oniony and didn't have any of that gamey flavor that chopped liver can get. A great recipe. THANKS!",

Use just one (1) large sweet onion two (2)stalks celery without the tops three (3) hard cooked eggs and schmaltz (rendered chicken fat) in place of the oil. When I have time I used the grinder but in a pinch you can use the food processor. Cut the onion and celery into large pieces. Coarsely process the celery and onion. Add the eggs and then add the liver and process a few seconds until all the ingredients are combined. Add the Schmaltz (to taste) by hand. Season with kosher salt --you'll use a few spoonfuls--and black pepper. Serve on sliced rye bread or matzoh crackers.",
