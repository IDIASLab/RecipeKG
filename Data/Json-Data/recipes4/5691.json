Macarons are made from almond flour and meringue, with even the pros claiming to failure on a regular basis. After going through dozens of recipes and trials, this is the most reliable macaron recipe I could come up with. You could get lighter using the Italian meringue method, but it's less dependable.",

It still worked out very well but that doesn't mean it will work the same way for everyone. My amounts and yours may vary slightly and with macarons, slight variations can result in less than optimal results. A few key steps that always help: Grind up the almond flour in your food processor to make it as fine as you can get it to ensure a smooth macaron, beat egg whites until stiff but not dry, fold in the almond flour/confectioner's sugar mixture very well but do not over do it or it will be too liquidy and your macarons will come out very flat, spread too much and look like amoebas rather than nice and round. Good luck! These are worth it!",

I have definitely ground my almond floor to make it finer with a coffee grinder or food processor. Some of my favorite flavours are a chocolate macaron where i added dutch cocoa powder to the dry mixture and then made a chocolate ganache from Lindt Excellece orange intense chocolate bars. I've also ground up pistachios in my coffee grinder and substituted them for the almond flour. I'm hoping to get some freeze dried raspberries and put them in the cookie part and a chocolate ganache center or a Blackforest using freeze dried cherries. Using freeze dried allows you to add intense flavour without changing the consistancy of the macaron.",
