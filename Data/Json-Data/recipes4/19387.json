        "description": "I love spaghetti Bolognese from my years living in England where it is a very popular dish, but wanted to be healthier. I think ground turkey Bolognese is better than the beef version! Feel free to add vegetables; this is an easy way to get my husband to eat more of them, and I use red lentils to increase the fiber content. This is a fast Bolognese, no 4 hours of simmering on a low stove. Who has the time? Top with cheese, if you like.",
