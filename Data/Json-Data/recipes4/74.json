I've made this multiple times now, and have adjusted it to just my liking: Use a handful of fresh baby spinach in place of lettuce, used only 1T of lite cream cheese mashed together with 1/4 to 1/3 of an avacado and a pinch of onion powder and black pepper(this seemed to make plenty of spread to cover both pieces of bread), add sliced pickles when the mood strikes.  I've tried it sprinkled with a variety of vinegars, and although I like them all, balsamic is my absolute favorite.  I also pass on the EVOO, and sometimes I sprinkle a little drief basil and/or oregano over the vinegar.  Absolutely fabulous & oh, so satisfying.",

Also be sure to use thick whole wheat bread or else the oil/vinegar combo will make the bread fall apart. Delicious!",
