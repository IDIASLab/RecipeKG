I give it 5-stars not because it's such an amazing dish (I mean come on it's just hot dogs & potatoes) but it's so quick & easy and has so much potential for experimentation. I only had brats on hand so I decided to stuff my mashed potatoes in the brats & poured mushroom gravy on top instead of cheese. My whole family loved it! I thought the name \"sheep dogs\" (as mentioned by another reviewer) was very clever for this dish. Next time I try this recipe I may try Italian sausages with marinara & mozzarella topping (i.e. the \"Italian Sheep Dog\") or sour cream bacos green onion & shredded cheddar cheese (i.e. the \"American Sheep Dog\"). As for the brat... well that'd be the German Sheep Dog:-) Just so many possibilities and tons of fun for the kids too!",

It's a quick and easy meal and you can use leftover real mashed potatoes or just make instant potatoes. I put everything on top at once and season it with onion powder or whatever seasoning I feel like adding and bake it until the cheese starts to turn light brown. Remember to use a baking sheet with edges so the cheese can't drip. The hot dogs will be hot inside due to the potato \"insulation\" so let them sit a few minutes before serving. Delicious!",
