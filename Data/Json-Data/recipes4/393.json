Yes an hour and a half is a long time UNLESS you use a chop at least an inch and a half thick. Living in Iowa we don't do thin chops. If your chops are thinner start the potatoes first and add chops the last half hour or so depending on the thickness. You can par boil your potatoes to speed things up or cover and microwave for 10 to 15 minutes. I am not one to add much salt while cooking so we salt ours at the table since there is alot of salt in the broth unless you use low sodium. Happy cooking!",
