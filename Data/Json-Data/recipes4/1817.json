I also added a bit of milk and sour cream on top of the mixture once it was in the baking dish.  I spread it on sort of like a frosting, before adding the bread crumbs.  I also splashed a bit more milk around the edges just to liquify it a little more.  It turned out perfect!  My whole household said that I should make this again.  It was a hit!",

I was in a huge rush when I chose this recipe however (a hungry 2 year old yanking at my leg) so I didn't read the reviews till after. Next time the change I'll be making is adding some milk because it was a tad dry. Not terrible but it did seem to need a bit of milk. I used some alphabet shaped whole wheat pasta to make it kid friendly and my 2 year old gobbled it right up happily! Definitely recommend this recipe, it was quick and easy and uses basic staple foods.",
