It's just not necessary... and I am a certified saltaholic!  I'm not sure that this recipe really needs the Worcestershire, or maybe just not as much. I also added a bayleaf and used fresh garlic (and plenty of it).  Instead of diluting the gravy mix with a full cup of water, I only used half a cup and I also blended in a tablespoon of cornstarch with the gravy mix before adding it to the beef.  I wouldn't use flour.  I'd stick with cornstarch.  Flour should actually be fully cooked or it can taste too, well, floury.  Cornstarch can safely be added just before serving.  I served this over mashed pototates.  It was good.",

Coated beef w/ flour, then sauteed.. added 2 Tbsp minced garlic w/ the onions instead of garlic powder.  1.75 cup beef broth, 1/4c red wine.  Did not add any salt or pepper.  Simmered 1 hour.  Then added the brown gravy directly to the beef (no extra liquid!) and simmered an additional 30 minutes while I made mashed potatoes to put it over.  It ended up DELICIOUS!  A tad bit salty, but we like salt.  Use some Pillsbury Grands to sop up the extra sauce and it was perfection.  Follow these steps and you will avoid the problems that keep coming up - overly salty (no salt, low sodium soy), too runny (no extra water at end), meat too tough (1.5hrs, at the most!).",

I just saute the mushrooms, garlic and onions with a little butter and olive oil before I add the meat to the pan. Using fresh mushrooms and garlic really makes a big difference.  I also like to use only 3/4 cup of water and I add 1/4 cup red wine.  About 15 minutes before I add the gravy mixture, I like to add about 1 cup of frozen peas to the beef tips.  At the end when I add in the gravy mixture I usually use a little less than one cup of water and add some flour or cornstarch to thicken it up a little more.  This is great served over egg noodles or rice.",

So at that point I mixed 1/3 cup of flour with 1/2 cup of milk,  shaken in an airtight container to get the lumps out. Then stir it into the pan. It made the gravy the perfect consistency for pouring over rice. You may want it a little thinner with noodles, but it won't work as the recipe describes. Doing this will also cut back on the \"too salty\" taste other reviewers spoke of. I didn't cut back on salt at all and it was perfect. Actually it was nice not to see my husband salt his food for once.  We really love this dish and will eat it often! Thanks so much for posting it.",

I floured the stew meat before browning, I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of powder, low sodium beef broth instead of water, half of the low sodium soy sauce, and no water with the gravy packet (maybe that's why it was so salty?). The sauce was nice and thick. Next time I will add in fresh mushrooms, maybe 1/2 cup of red wine - and I will leave out the soy sauce altogether. I don't really care for the taste of it anyway.",
