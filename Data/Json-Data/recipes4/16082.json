The egg mixture made a good half inch/inch of topping which we preferred. Instead of walnuts used dry roasted pecans that were on hand. This saved the toasting step too. The eggs were brown cage free and made a much fuller taste than egg substitute. Added fresh fruit slices to fill out the plate. Company meal!",
