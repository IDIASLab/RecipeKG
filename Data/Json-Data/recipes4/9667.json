Feel Free to add fish bones, crab shells or any other shellfish shells you have around.  The best gumbo stock I make is almost exactly like this but we use leftover  crawfish shells from crawfish boils done in Zatarains Liquid.  It adds a real zing to the stock that really helps the gumbo.",

It was incredible and I beleive roasting the shrimp shells really makes the difference. I made shrimp etoufee this past Saturday for Mardi Gras party and wanted to use this stock but didn't have the time to roast the shells and then simmer for the 7 hours to make it. I had a pint of some really rich shrimp stock I had made earlier using shrimp heads and shells and a pint of some rich home-made chicken stock that I added to the water. The house smelled so good and the stock was so yummy. I had some left and added some other ingredients for a small bowl of soup yesterday - Delicious!! Who wold have thought to add cloves? Brilliant!",
