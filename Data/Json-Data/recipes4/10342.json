I used crushed chocolate covered shortbread cookies and chocolate malt balls in addition to the chocolate covered toffee bits. I used Devil's Food flavored pudding and I made the Deep Dish Brownies recipe from this site in place of the cake mix. I also used instant coffee instead of the brewed kind. It was a huge hit at my dessert party and went fast. I also sprinkled some cocoa and a few coffee crystals on the top of the cool whip in the final layer. \r\nThis recipe is always in rotation and I know it by heart. Don't be afraid to experiment with ingredients. Try using some sliced frozen strawberries that are thawed out or, for an absolutely deadly experience, the buttercream frosting from ths site on one layer. Also, Oreo cookies placed on the top and middle layer for decoration also meld in nicely for a wonderful flavor. This is truly deadly and addictive.",

If I am in a super hurry sometimes I'll just by the McCain's frozen cakes (2) and scrape off the icing. If you don't have a Skor you can use packaged toffee bits in a pinch but DON'T try to substitute another chocolate bar I've tried that and it is not pleasing to bite into big chunks of chocolate. Drizzling Kaluha over the cake pieces is also good. Update: If you want to make this toddler friendly (ie. for a birthday potluck etc) you can buy clear plastic cups and layer the cake pudding Skor Bar and end with whipped cream put some chocolate curls on top and you have little individual cake cups. A family member brought this to our reunion and it was the best idea ever for the kids.",

I didnt use a frozen whipped topping because it's not available where Im living so I whipped up cream and added a tad bit of sugar to it. Using cream that wasn't as sweet as store boughten whipped toppings actually worked perfectly as the dessert is already really really sweet!",
