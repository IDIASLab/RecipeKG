I also reserved about 1 cup of the broth, added 1 Tbsp of brown sugar to it and cooked carrots in it. Best carrots I've ever had. Husband and 2 year old daughter also loved every bit of it. This goes very well with sweet potatoes sprinkled (heavily) with paprika, chili powder, and salt and sauted in coconut oil. If I could give the whole thing more stars I would. Thanks for sharing.",
