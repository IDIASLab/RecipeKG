I used to make my daughters birthday cake and got sooo many compliments on it. I pinched off a few peices before rolling it out and used liquid food color to make other colors for decorating. This was really easy to work with easier then fondant if you ask me and it tastes so much better too. It tasted like a white chocolate tootsie roll (my fav. candy). Yummy. This will be my new way of making covered cakes and decorations. Thank you so very much for posting!",

My friend and I made 30 white and regular chocolate roses and 60 assorted leaves to place on a full sheetcake for an anniversary party. Just let it set out a room temperature overnight otherwise its too sticky to work with. We had to dust our hands only occasionally while working with it. We dusted our hands with a little cocoa powder for the dark chocolate ones and a little vanilla protein powder for the white chocolate. Didn't think to try oiling our hands with a little vegetable oil! Thanks Emily B.",

I made about 85 white roses for my mom's 85th birthday.(I used confectioners sugar instead of cocoa mix---but vegetabale oil sounds like a good alternative too!). They covered the top of my mom's birthday 4 tier chocolate birthday cake. It was gorgeous. A real show stopper. Everyone wanted a picture!!! I have 2 requests for this birthday cake for next year! I've been experimenting with the plastic and used it to mold bowling pins and bowling balls for my 7 y.o. birthday cake; I made a school bus for the teachers when they started school this year. It's a long time to learn how to manipulate the plastic chocolate but it is sooooooo worth it!",

The downside to this recipe is that the final product was not delicious. In fact I found it completely inedible.

My daughter wanted a \"big sub sandwich\" instead of a cake for her 15th birthday but made her a cake-sub. I used the \"Plastic chocolate\" to make the pickles lettuce and tomatoes... WONDERFUL!!! TIP: Instead of using oil or powdered anything to roll this out I rolled it out between a silicone mat and a piece of parchment paper -NO STICKING! Also when it started to get a bit sticky from working with it I wrapped it in plastic and popped it in the frig for a few minutes... Perfection!:-)",
