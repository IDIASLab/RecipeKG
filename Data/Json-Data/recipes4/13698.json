I halved the recipe and the only subs I used were sliced baby bella schrooms and I used olive oil spray for the oils. I followed it exactly right down to cooking the filets 5 min on each side then resting for 10 min at which time I finished the sauce. My husband likes his meat more well done so I sliced him two medallion sized pieces off the tenderloin roast and my rare-medium piece was thicker. For the guacamole I mashed two avocados and used lemon juice but I didn't have a fresh jalapeno so I took a jar of salsa and rinsed it off leaving the diced chilis tomato and onion chunks. I used about a tablespoon of that! LOL Creative Cooking at it's finest. I served it on the plate with tri colored tortilla strip salad toppers on top. It was a refreshing taste to go with the richness of the meat dish. For my starch I used a russet potato peeled cored and spiral sliced on my apple peeler then cooked it in butter ground pepper and sea salt in a frying pan. I can attest that it did take about two hours to fix. I pre-slice/cut/measure all my ingredients before I start cooking and that made the cooking time smoother. It wasn't the greatest choice for a week day meal but it sure was good! I wish I had taken a picture of the plate and will be sure to next time! Bon Appetite!",

We didn't have shallots so we substituted with onion using half a medium onion in the dip which turned out to be too much but next time we'll use less.

                "reviewBody": "I followed the recipe loosely using boneless chicken breasts instead of filet mignon as I felt it was a better fit - I prefer my filet with salt pepper and little else. (Ok maybe a dab of butter). I also altered the seasoning to what you might use for fajitas. I skipped the beurre blanc because it was not needed and better suited for fish or seafood. This is a nice dish with a beautiful presentation but the recipe itself is unnecessarily lengthy and complicated. Just cook up some peppers top them with a nice filet (or in my case a well-seasoned chicken breast) and a dollop of guacamole. Done.",

I made a few adaptations to the recipe as follows.  I made a spice rub (smoked paprika, garlic salt, brown sugar, salt, chili powder, black pepper, onion powder) and appied it to the beef the day before I cooked it.  I roasted the tenderloin in the oven at 275 degrees until it reached a temperature of 140 degrees.  This slow roasting method (a la Alton Brown) really sealed in the juices and kept the meat tender.  After the meat reached 140 degrees, I removed the tenderloin from the oven and rubbed it with an olive oil and herb combo and then pan seared it for 1-2 minutes each side.  I then let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting. When cutting it, the meat had the nice red color and was very juicy and tender. I put the bell pepper and mushroom mixture on the plate, put several slices of the tenderloin on top, and then poured over it a delicious cilantro-lime butter finishing sauce. I put the guacamole on top and then sprinkled tri-color tortilla strips on top.  I have included a picture. Voila!  Thanks for a great recipe!  I will definitley be making this again at my next dinner party. Even my friend's 6-year old asked for \"seconds\"!",
