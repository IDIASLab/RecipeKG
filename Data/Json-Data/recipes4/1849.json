I used 3/4 cup cracker crumbs and 3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese plus I used flounder since that was what was in the freezer. The only change I would make is to line the pan with foil and use non-stick spray - the bottom of my fish stuck to the pan and I lost pretty much of the coating. Thanks for this tasty idea!",

I'm an excellent cook and although I was skeptical about the ingredients I followed the recipe exactly since it was the 1st time I made it. The recipe calls for way too many cracker crumbs and the salad dressing is overpowering so you don't taste the halibut. In addition the spices as \"to taste\" which is difficult to tell how much to add when you have so many cracker crumbs! As a result we scraped off the entire topping from the fish and ate it without any of the coating. The coating didn't cook well in our experience - despite the fact we cooked it 20 mins longer than recommended. Sorry I don't recommend this and we won't be having it again.",
