I was at a bulk foods store a couple of hours after eating this recipe, and I was not even remotely tempted to buy any sweets! (Believe me, that's a first.)\n\nI didn't have any Quinoa on hand, and I minced sliced almonds as opposed to using almond meal, but otherwise used ingredients as listed.\n\n  I always add some milk and a bit of brown sugar to my bowl of oatmeal.  Terrific!",

The bonus, it can be made as a make ahead mix -so long as you wait to add the apple and water. Thoughts...I didn't make the full batch, and with an odd number of servings the reduction feature wasn't so handy. Regardless, I reduced it by fourths (1/4 cup oats, 2 Tbsp quinoa, flax, walnuts, etc., you get the picture) the one thing I did change was to use craisins- I prefer them to raisins.\nIf you prefer added calcium swap in milk for the water. Some may prefer a pinch of salt or dab of butter. \nOh the aroma- mmmm so comforting on a cold winter day!!!",
