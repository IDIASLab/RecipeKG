This would be good with some green beans or peas for added nutrition and color too. Very good full bodied flavor and this will be my go to veggie soup.  Thank you so much for sharing!",

If you love a strong tomato flavor to your steak soup, then this is a great recipe for you.  If i make this again, I will definitely omit the paste.  Otherwise, this would be a wonderful recipe.",

After reading the reviews and some saying the tomato paste was too much I added it a Tablespoon at a time and used about half the can which was enough for my taste. The marjoram and paprika flavor is nice and while the meat was simmering I added 1/2 c. cabernet wine (dry red wine) which enhanced and brought together the flavors. It took a little longer for my meat to cook to tender. I felt no need to thicken this soup further as it is soup and not stew. Flavors developed more after allowing to rest. Delicious and great with a hunk of crusty bread.",

Because my steak was already grilled to medium rare I did not put it in with the onions until about a minute before the time came to coat the onion and steak mixture.   I sliced it more thin than cubed so there were more \"pieces\" in the soup.    I used Vidalia onions, because they are my fave when I can get them in California.    I left out the celery leaves, only because I have family that inexplicably dislikes the the taste of celery.   Otherwise I followed the recipe to a \"T.\"    \n\nSuper well received, and the recipe was requested!\n\nWhen I make it again I might add a little more broth because after refrigerating it was much less \"soup like.\"     But it was still good.    I had some leftover red potatoes I had mashed with 1% low fat milk and Smart Balance and simply added the thick steak soup to them and had the equivalent of a healthy delectable Shepherd's Pie.\n\nThanks again!",

Lastly, I replaced the potatoes with barley because of the nutritional benefits it brings. Very yummy.",
