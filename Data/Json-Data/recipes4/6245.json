So I added a little bit of seasoned salt celery salt garlic powder cayenne pepper cumin and about 2 teaspoons of minced garlic to the meat before adding in the veggies. Left out the regular salt and black pepper. I also did not have crescent rolls but I did have pillsbury biscuits which worked out just as well. Served with some roasted (Microwaved) potatoes that I basted in the left over egg and sauteed asparagus. Will definitely make again.",
