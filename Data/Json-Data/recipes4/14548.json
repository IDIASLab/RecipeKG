The only changes I made were to use broccolini instead of broccoli rabe (since my market didn't have any today) and I cut down on the crushed red pepper to about 2 tsp instead of 1 tbsp. It was still plenty spicy and delicious!  I also used whole wheat penne and half grated/half shredded parmesan. Next time I probably won't cook up a full box of pasta, because I didn't end up using all of it. I think 2/3 of a box suits our tastes. Hubby warned me before dinner that he wasn't hungry, so he only had me dish up a small portion. Well guess who went back for seconds and thirds! :)  A definite keeper!",

I followed another reviewers suggestion and only used 2 tsp of the red pepper flakes.. Perfect spicyness factor. For those who don't like spice I would suggest to skip the flakes and just use some diced red or green pepper... I have made this recipe a few times as stated but when I made it today I had some Alfredo sauce in the fridge.. I added some of that at the end of cooking (not much just enough to coat it.. Maybe 1/4 or 1/3cup?) and it didn't change the flavor but was really good! Just creamier/added to the sauce..any pasta noodle would work well (bowtie elbow fettucini ect) a sprinkle of fresh parm ontop is a must!",

The heat from the red pepper flakes overwhelmed the other flavors in the dish in my opinion. However my husband (who likes spicy food) loved the dish and is looking forward to the leftovers! I think spinach kale or broccoli could easily be substituted for the broccoli rabe in this recipe if you adjusted the cooking times.",

I just made a couple small changes. First I saut\u00e9ed sausage garlic and only about 2 teaspoons of the crushed red pepper (trust me when I say this was spicy enough). I had to use spiral pasta instead of penne because that's what I had. Also at the very end I squeezed half a lemon over the pasta. I felt like the dish was very rich and really needed that flavor brightener. It was delicious!! I will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing!",
