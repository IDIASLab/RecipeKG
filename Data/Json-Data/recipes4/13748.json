Also I recommend cutting the kimchi up into smaller pieces. I also added sliced serrano peppers when adding the kimchi. You do not have to use a full cup of kimchi. Best to use korean red pepper flakes (different flavor & texture) available at any asian market in large bags (will last a long time). The vinegar cooks off so if you are worrying about that don't. Lastly I would add more than 1 tbsp of water towards the end to keep it moist. I ended up putting about 3-4 tbsp of water. Serve immediately over hot fresh rice!",
