I marinate the shrimps (I use frozen precooked shrimps) then, boil on medium heat for 15 minutes, once the shrimps are done I remove and place the shrimps aside, then fry the rice with the marinate add water and boil until the rice is almost cooked then place the rice covered in a preheated oven at 165 degrees celcius for 15 minutes or until rice is well cooked, once done I remove all the spices and place the shrimps on top along with a few parsley leaves before serving. I use exactly the same amount for all the ingredients as directed in the original recipe, hope that helps, Bon Apetite!",
