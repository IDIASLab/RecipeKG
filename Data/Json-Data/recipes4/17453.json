Had to eat it with a fork on a plate and warn people what was inside so they didn't think it was under cooked (people mentioned they thought this before I told them). And it didn't have enough lemon flavoring to suit me. May try it again with a lemon cake mix (saves a step-but would be more yellow) or additional lemon zest. Icing also way too sweet to suit my taste. Will probably cut the sugar in half with the icing next time.",
