We've made it several times now, and this last time found me without Lipton Onion Soup Mix in the house; I ended up adding extra minced onion, some onion salt, pepper and a bit of garlic seasoning. It still turned out great, with almost the same flavor as usual. We serve it on tortillas, typically, but have also used it on sliced french bread or a sandwich bun. Great for freezing, as it makes a lot. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",

Then I chopped up a green pepper and cooked it all together on high for a couple hours.  I also added a can of Rotel tomatoes.  I added a 1/3 of red wine because it needed more liquid and a by dinner time it was tender and delish!  It was tender after 3 hours of cooking on high on the stove.",

I've  made some changes too, subbed 1 can rotel for the salsa, added 1 can of diced green chilies, used 1/2 can beef broth for the water, reduced red wine to 1/2 cup, added 1 can black beans, 1/2 a diced onion and some minced garlic and simmered in my slow cooker.  Omitted dry onion soup, because I didn't have any, but it didn't seem to need it.  Very good, and very tender.  Shredded beef, added some white rice and wrapped in flour tortillas with some shredded cheese.  Yum...  ",

I've tried them all - Mijo's slow cooker shredded beef Charley's slow cooker Mexican style meat & shredded beef for tacos. None including this one meet my expectations. Having said this I do think this recipe is the best of them all but will require some mods if I ever make it again. Christy's recipe is a bit too savory IMHO. Even with hot salsa it tasted too much like pot roast. I'd definitely up the amount of salsa next time (maybe in lieu of the H2O called for???). My only changes were slow cooking my roast (I like to find ways to use my sc whenever possible) & adding a t of minced garlic. I seared my roast / sauteed my onion as directed dumped everything in the sc cooked on HIGH for 2 hrs. & then on LOW for another 4. NOTE: Every hr. on high ='s 2-2 1/2 on low. I didn't get around to prepping dinner until Noon. Since I wanted to eat at a decent hr. I started everythig on high but I don't recommend this. Beef cuts are better suited on low. NOTE #2: The low setting is around 200 degrees F & the high setting around 300. One last note.... 4-5 hr. on HIGH / 8-10 on LOW are suitable timeframes for oven cooking times ranging from 1-3 hr. I hope this helps those of you wanting to use your sc! Served on fried corn tortillas w/ salsa red cabbage cilantro queso fresco & a side of Mexican rice. Bacardi mojitos completed our meal.
