It has a yummy, rich topping, definitely not for the person that wants a plain piece of salmon.  I recommend making half of the mayonnaise/mustard topping.  There is NO way you need as much as the recipe calls for, and that would greatly reduce the fat and calorie count.  With that one change I think you'll find this is a delicious way to enjoy your salmon.",

Instead of all mayo, I used 1 cup lowfat plain yogurt and 1/2 cup mayo (to keep it lighter and healthier!), and I only had dijon mustard on hand - so I used that instead of regular mustard.  Didn't have thyme, so I used more fresh basil.  Also, I find it necessary to season salmon with fresh, crushed garlic and salt/pepper..rubbed in with extra virgin olive oil.  Topped each filet with the sauce and baked on olive-oil sprayed foil-lined baking sheet for 15-20 minutes.\nThank you so much for this excellent recipe!  In my binder, permanently! :-)",

I substituted most of the mayo for plain unsweetened yogurt. TERRIFIC. This sauce was so good I will probably use it for any time I want sauce for fish. I just used the dried herbs because that was all I had no problems fresh would be even bettr I'm sure. I have to admit I also put a tiny bit of brown sugar in the sauce-maybe a Tablespoon. I squeezed lemon on my fish and sprinkled it with salt and pepper before spreading on the sauce too. Really Loved it!",

Did not have fresh basil but used dried thyme basil oregano and dill to make the sauce. Sprinkled the salmon fillet with salt fresh ground pepper and garlic powder and spread the dill mixture on top. It was so good! I am glad we had extra sauce because I made roasted red potatoes and broccoli. My 8 year old step-son couldn't stop eating it and he loved dipping the broccoli in the extra sauce. Since it was yogurt and no mayo I figured he could enjoy a little extra and it got lots of green vegetable into him!",

It's better to broil/bake the fish with a little salt and pepper and to use the dill sauce as a dressing on the side of the fish when you plate it. Also I changed the recipe and used 2 parts yogurt and 1 part mayo with dijon AND brown mustard with a little Italian herbs and dill.",
