I still like traditional cookies better, but for a quick easy cookie, these are hard to beat.",

I did a bunch of these over Christmas--we were staying in a hotel room with a kitchenette and it was the simplest round of baking I've ever done in my life.  If you want to make uniform balls, try a small ice cream scoop with a spring-release. I also recommend parchment, and watching for the very first signs of browning on the edge, so you have a soft, chewy cookie.",
