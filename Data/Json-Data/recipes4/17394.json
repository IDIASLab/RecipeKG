I only cooked my quinoa for about 12 mins because that's how I like it. I also rinsed the quinoa beforehand to remove any bitterness .  The red pepper and garlic seasoning I used was salt-free, so I did have to add some salt at the end.  I think next time I will toss in the fresh herbs after the quinoa is cooked, to maximize flavor.",
