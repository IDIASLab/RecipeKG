I sauteed my onions in a heavy bottom sauce pan and added my meat in this case Johnsonville Sweet Italian sausage which I removed from the casing and cooked them together until the sausage was almost cooked. I added the rice the tomatoes undrained and 1/2 cup of water stirred it all together and allowed it to come to a boil then reduced the heat and let it simmer until all the liquid absorbed. Just before serving I added my diced green pepper. Super easy great flavor and a fun twist on Spanish rice. Thanks Mark!",
