During that time we tried several different pear cake recipes, but none came close to this one. Now that it has been found again (and slightly updated), I want to share it with all of you, so that everyone can enjoy it! With love, Sarah.",

The pear flavor doesn't stand out, however, and I disregarded the instructions to mix and mix for 3 minutes after adding the flour.  Also, if you're \"creaming\" turbinado and grapeseed oil, you can stop wasting your time...oil and sugar with this texture will never cream.  Beating has no effect whatsoever.  I'd give the cake a 4-5 stars, but the instructions about a 3.",
