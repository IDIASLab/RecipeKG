However after taking it out of the oven the cake fell--I was afraid the whole things would be ruined. But as it turned out I had plenty of room for the toppings and it was a great success! I think it could have used more than 1 can of the lemon pie filling--maybe a can and a half to two cans....otherwise it was fantastic.",
