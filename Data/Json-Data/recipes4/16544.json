As well as original ingredients I tweaked recipe with 2 tsp each: cumin turmeric then a dash of salt and pepper. Included chopped zucchini. Used a medium roaster because I was worried it would spill over. About 2/3 way through the cooking time I added some spicy Clamato juice because I felt it might be getting a bit dry (1 1/2 cups). This could be the missing ingredient for anyone who felt the recipe was lacking in taste. Anyway a must try for anyone looking to add fiber into their diet!",
