I omitted the rutabega added 5 small potatoes added some fresh basil I had on hand for another recipe and added a bit of salt. The flour/milk mixture makes a nice creamy broth. I do not have a food processor therefore I used another recipe I had for the dumplings. Will definately be making this recipe again and again! Thanks Christine...",

I've tried it with and without the rutabaga and now believe it does not matter whether it is there. Fresh parsley is a must. The salt for the broth needs to be reduced -- start by reducing it to half of what the recipe calls for and add according to your taste. I frequently add fresh or canned corn garlic. I also like to add small noodles about 10 minutes before it is done and frozen peas a minute or two before serving. This soup is comfort food no doubt about it. If you are worried it might be to bland for you I'd 1 1/2 x the onion for extra flavor...I have made this several times sometimes using chicken instead of turkey. It is very good.",
