You only need 3 good sized ears of corn to get 3 cups of kernels not 6 ears like it says. With those changes we really enjoyed this. I used fresh sweet corn I cooked then cut off the cob. This was light healthy and refreshing. It also is a perfect consistency to use as a dip. We will save it to our faves and make this again for sure. Perfect for hot summer days when you don't want to cook.",
