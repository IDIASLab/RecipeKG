We opted for Minute Rice and just followed the directions that were given here. The sushi remained very moist for the two days that it took us to finish eating it. We used 2 1/2 sheets of the nori vs. the 2 recommended. This made the sushi MUCH easier to roll as well as creating more servings. My one other suggestion would be to refridgerate the freshly rolled sushi for a couple of hours prior to slicing, as this makes slicing much easier and cleaner. This also gives the nori a chance to soften up. We decided to use the already toasted nori, perhaps that was why the dish was better the next day after remaining in the fridge overnight. We will definitely be making this recipe again. Thanks so much for sharing, Samantha!",

We LOVE sushi in this house but dont like paying .50-1.00 a slice (especially since it costs about that much per ROLL to make it at home!)  I dont add cucumber (uck) and use regular sticky rice since its what we eat normally (we buy 50 lb bags at the oriental store lol cheap and AWESOME) When I lay the rice down on the nori (oriental stores have nori also.. just ask) I sprinkle a little bit of sugar on the rice; it masks the flavor of the rice vinegar.  And if you like heat, try doing this with imitation lobster and sprinkling it with regular hot sauce! Thanks for posting :)",
