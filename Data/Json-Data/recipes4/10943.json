I also added the fresh basil last, NOT cooking it in the simmering stage for 10 minutes.  As written this is a 3-star recipe, but with these simple changes it is a 5-star soup, one that Hubs compares to a memorable soup we enjoyed at \"Purple Cafe and Wine Bar,\" in downtown Seattle.  (Rating this 3 stars might have discouraged others from trying this easily improved soup)",
