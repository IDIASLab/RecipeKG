If I make this again I would definitely add salt, pepper, garlic and if I'm feeling a little crazy, red pepper flakes. I would also probably cut the grape tomatoes in half so they give up some of their juice while cooking.",

I only had cherry tomatoes so used those cut in fourths. I also added salt and pepper. It was a very attractive and the flavor was ok- but something was still missing. I made the Parmesan crisps but they didn't seem to go ( they seemed greaser making them this way I have made the on parchment paper in oven and liked the result better).
