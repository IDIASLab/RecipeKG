If you don't have lavender it is ok, use a floral honey and it will taste heavenly all the same. I made three batches. In one I used dried rose pedals (equalling 10 rosebuds) instead of lavender and a mild honey. Batch 2 I used floral honey but no lavender or roses. Batch 3 I used rose pedals and cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg for a Christmas effect and they are delicious. They are moist and tender but sturdy. Only 5 ingredients, easy instrucions, even I couldn't mess these up. They don't crumble and even hold up to being dunked in hot tea. Thanks Sueb for another super cookie recipe. All were made with gf flour instead of regular.",

It would have helped if the recipe said if the flour was self raising or plain (all purpose) flour. I ended up using half and half - which may not have been the best idea. Also no idea what size spoon the batter is meant to be dropped from - teaspoon tablespoon or something different. The cookies turned out ok. The flavour is very subtle though even the honey doesn't come through very strongly (and I chose a strong flavoured honey). I added lemon zest as well - so that could be why. Will definitely give them another go maybe with a smidge of salt added. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",
