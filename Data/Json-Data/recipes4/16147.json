A good reason to keep cake mixes in the cupboard for when there are unexpected guests. I've done a couple of variations using different flavours of mixes and add ins. They work well too. Thank you for this recipe.",

My husband thought, it would pair nicely with some frosting since the cookies are soft.  Make sure to have your butter and eggs at room temperature.  Also,  I was afraid of my cookies\r\nsticking to the sheet so I lightly sprayed it with Pam.  Baked for 15 minutes.",

My husband my grandsons and their parents each have their own favorite and their tastes don't correspond. This one pleased them all! I had to use what I had on hand as we were having an ice storm and could not get to the grocery store. I was out of butter and almost out of oil so I substituted 1/4 cup corn oil and 1/4 cup coconut oil and a French vanilla cake mix. The result was wonderful.. I'm making them again today!",
