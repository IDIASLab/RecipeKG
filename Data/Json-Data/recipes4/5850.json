I took others suggestions and used a 1/4 c is cream cheese, 1/2 cup greek yogurt, 1/2 cup grated parmesan and 1/4 cup of mayonnaise.  I mixed these ingredients together and added a small amount of freshly grated nutmeg.  I sauteed half a chopped onion and the added a 10z package of chopped spinach and two freshly minced garlic cloves.  Once cooled, I added the spinach and onion mixture to the cream cheese mixture.  I chopped the chicken (I brined the chicken first for about 4-6 hours) and added the chicken to the mixture.  I poured the mixed into a baking dish sprays with Pam and then added more grated parmesan cheese on top.  Then baked following the directions.  This was a fabulous dish I served with freshly baked french bread.",
