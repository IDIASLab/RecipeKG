I seasoned it well with garlic and fresh pepper than cooked/browned all sides in a pan with olive oil.  It cooked on low in the crockpot for 6 hrs with NO VEGES.  My family loves mashed potatoes with roast.  I used 1/2 c. of wistershire sauce, 1/2 c. Sweet Baby Ray's Original plus 1/2 c. water.  The meat was tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  It turned out delish!!  I can't stop picking at the meat and dinner was over 2 hrs ago.  Thanks for this easy recipe.",
