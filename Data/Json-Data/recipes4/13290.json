I normally make pot roast in my crock pot so this was the first time I had made beef gravy from the drippings. I thickened it with corn starch and cream. The bay and allspice flavors were very pleasant. I considered using a half cup of bay leaves like the recipe suggested but that would have tapped me out so I just used 3 leaves instead.",
