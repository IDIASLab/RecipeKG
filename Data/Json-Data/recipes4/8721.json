Because I didn't have jerk seasoning blend on hand, I added jerk flavours to the dip.  The ingredients that went into the blender were all the above plus one onion, 2 1/2 tsp. thyme, 2 tsp. allspice, 2 tsp. black pepper, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. cayenne, and salt instead of the jerk seasoning blend.  While the flavour was out of this world, the other revelation was the long cooking at a lower temperature.  Usually I make my wings at a higher temp for a shorter time, and while they're good, the texture was much better this way:  crispy on the outside, and meltingly tender on the inside.  I'll never cook wings at a higher temp ever again.",

The sauce has a fresh and flavorful taste. Following are the changes I made or will make the next time I make these: 1. Use fresh jalapeno instead of pickled. I did and it is the way to go for added fresh taste. 2. Make more sauce than the recipe calls for. The chicken can be somewhat dry if you use all of the sauce prior to roasting. This sauce is so good that you can use the extra for dipping and added moisture after they are done cooking. 3. Rotate the wings every 30 minutes. I neglected to do this and while they were quite good they ended up being kind of burnt on one side and not very crisp on the other. Overall an excellent recipe and I will make again.",

I didn't have any green onions so I just left that out. And I only let it marinate for about two hours. I served this over white rice with raisins cooked in-this gave a little balance to the spice. I was not expecting it to be very spicy due to other reviews and they were right. But my husband and I found it a unique flavorful burn. I suggest liberally adding salt once it is on your plate. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!",
