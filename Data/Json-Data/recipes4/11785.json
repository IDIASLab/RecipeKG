Rice and ground beef in tomato sauce, baked under a layer of shredded cheese. A great way to feed several with hamburger, and easy to keep on hand ingredients. Leftovers can be made into quick roll-ups by microwaving in a tortilla.",

I regret to say I forgot to add the bacon, I didn't realize it until the cheese was sprinkled on.  I added a can of corn and a can of black beans (rinsed and drained).  I am a big fan of tomato products so I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with chilies.  When adding salt and pepper I added a few more spices.  I threw in some cumin, chili powder and a little dried red peppers.  Ended up with a little zip to the flavor.  I will make this again.",

After browning the bacon and beef I added the remaining ingredients and placed in a Crockpot to simmer for several hours. I also used a dash or two of Mrs. Dash. More like a thick soup with the cheddar melting over the bowel... VERY good!",
