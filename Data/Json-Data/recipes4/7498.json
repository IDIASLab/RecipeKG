                "reviewBody": "Definitely a keeper. I enjoyed these but made some changes. I roasted the cauliflower without the foil. I also had to use different cheese because I don't have cheddar available to me. I used a 6 place muffin tin. I used three different cheeses, in two muffins: parmigiano reggiano and they were good. In another two I used a mild fontina, and they were delicate and good. In the last two I used pecorino romano and they were out of this world. I used an 1/8 teaspoon of crushed red peppers in each muffin, so if you like things spicy do add more than 1/8 to the mixture. I followed the advice of the other reviewer and added the cheese and the peppers in the mixture. They don't get crunchy on the bottom. I debated flipping them over and broiling them to get them crunchy on the bottom but changed my mind after tasting them, they were good cooked just the way they are. Times and temperatures are right on. Thanks Ladanams for this recipe.",
