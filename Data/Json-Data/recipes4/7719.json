I didn't use canned tomatoes - I used fresh chopped tomatoes and a little spaghetti sauce. I also added a small can of chopped mushrooms. I used Pillsbury pizza dough (refrigerated dough not frozen). It turned out so well - it looks amazing! (wish I'd snapped a picture for this review) My family couldn't wait to dig into it. However I would try a different dough. I made the leftover dough into breadsticks and they were so-so. Pillsbury calls it pizza dough but it tastes a little too sweet almost like their crescent rolls but not that delicate. I've made pizza with that dough and it was okay. But next time I'll look for the frozen dough for this recipe.",

The hubby called this an 'upside down pizza' (he had turned up his nose when I told him what I was making then went back for seconds....) Used the Trader Joes pizza crust (the best fresh pizza crust 1.19 can buy in my opinion) which baked up perfectly - only needed about 2/3 of it for the disposable pie tins. Doubled the recipe to make 2 pies and only needed 3 cans of tomatoes. Also added onion and green pepper. Used a mozzarella and provolone blend (not quite the 2 cups though it could have used it). With a salad this is a perfect meal. Note: Bought the wrong cans of diced tomatoes - celery green peppers and onions and just added 1 teaspoon of basil and 1 teaspoon of oregano and it worked out just fine - nothing was overwhelming.",
