I\u2019m not sure if there is a error in this recipe that you should be using precooked sausages.  In any case, I used precooked sausages and then gave them a head start on the grill before adding it to the shrimp.   I cooked the skewers a few minutes per side until the shrimp was cooked and turned pink.  I think grilling shrimp for 15 minutes would result in a tough and rubbery shrimp.  Please note that I removed the shell from the shrimp for marinating.  It just didn\u2019t make sense to me to marinate the shrimp with the shells on.  What can I say?  We all have our idiosyncrasies.",

I used the large shrimp 16/20 and cooked them on the cooler side of the grill yes they do cook quicker than the sausages so add them when the sausage is half way or a little more to being done. 3. I did not skewer them I served on a platter with the shrimp in the center surrounded by the sausages. I hope this helps! Thank you for trying the recipe!",

I didn't really measure anything for the shrimp marinade but I used EVOO fresh lemon juice lots of minced garlic some salt and some Cholula hot sauce. It marinated for about 30 minutes before we put them on the skewers with the sausage and grilled them. YUMMMMM... we could not get over how delicious this was. Thank you for an awesome recipe! I can't add a photo because we ate them too fast. My husband son and brother visiting from out of town all thought they were wonderful. Oh- my shrimp was small and already peeled and deveined. It did not dry out in the short time it was on the medium-high heat to warm and slightly char the sausage. So so good!",
