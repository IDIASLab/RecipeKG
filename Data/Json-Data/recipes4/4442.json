I can see many uses for it. Instead of round steak I used sirloin and slightly froze it to get the steak thinly sliced.  I used a vidalia onion, cut up a green pepper and added that to the mixture. I used a bit more sea salt, Worcestershire and liquid smoke (just another dash).  And, even though I had the garlic mayo I did add a bit of garlic to the steak, onion, and green pepper mixture - just a little out of habit.  We got some really great rolls for these and the provolone cheese just put it all over the top! Thanks for a great recipe!",

I also added tomato after it was baked, but again, that was a personal preference. We LOVED the garlic parmesan mayo and I think next time I would even add a little more parm. cheese. I think this would also be great with some sauteed mushrooms too. I will definately be making this one again! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Wow It is gone in 60 seconds!!",

To ensure the round steak is tender do the following: pound it out (if you don't have a meat mallet you can stab it to death with a fork then pound it out with the back of a large heavy metal spoon) slice it as thinly as possible...paper thin! or consider marinating it in the worchestershire for a while. The mayo sauce is awesome too.",
