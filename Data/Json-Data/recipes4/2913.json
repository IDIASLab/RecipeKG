The only changes  that I did is that I cooked  the onion in about 2-3 tbsp. of oil until is soft and translucent and added to the slow cooker and mixing with everything, I didn't use garlic and I used beef brisket and bone in, skinless chicken breast( my husband prefers the chicken). Also I covered with water and on top of everything I put some whole, in shell and uncooked eggs. When the chulent is ready you will remove their shells, they will have a dark colour and are very good. I forgot to mention that before I put the eggs in I washed them very well with dish soap. Thank you Niki11784 for a wonderful recipe.",

Advice?\n\nAfter researching this dish more, I see most people cover it with water, and that's what I ended up doing, even though it was a crockpot, and that worked.",
