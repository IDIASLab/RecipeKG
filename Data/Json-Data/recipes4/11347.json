I put some butter in the pan for frying and added the garlic which I cooked for a few minutes before adding the chicken. I spiced up the chicken with light creole seasoning garlic powder black peppere just a dash of cayenne and parsley. I have also added a bit of butter and garlic into the broth to add some additional flavor there as well. Hope everyone enjoys!!",
