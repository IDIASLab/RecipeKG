I was after something different tonight and this was it. Green peppers in stuffing was a first for me. So was bacon. And this was the first time I did not add a beaten egg. Rather than boiling the vegetables bacon and sausage I browned the meats and sweated the vegetables. I added the warmed broth to the combined ingredients. I used about 1/3 less of the spices called for which proved to be a good call for us. Bottom line? Eh nice to try but not a repeat for us. There was so much going on with this stuffing that the bread part of bread stuffing was lost. Two stars from Hubs and I m being generous with my three.",
