I made two at the same time and increased the final 30 minutes to 40.   These were devoured in 5 minutes or less and by extremely picky children (and one grown man as well!)  Enjoy!!",

The usual pastry is a shortcrust or whats know as pie cust here.  That being said this is delicious, the only thing I did find was that the mixture was not enough to fill my pan ~ so I did have to use 1 cup of milk and 4 eggs.  I did think that the oven was also too hot and in future I will cook this at 350 degrees for the full duration.  Ths is a great basic recipe and can be modified to use any ingredients you have too hand. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.",
