Homemade bread crumbs the best--you can leave more coarse.  Broil the top if you want the coating more crunchy or spray tops with a pump butter spray such as \"Can't Believe it's Not Butter\" type---coats better than drizzling melted butter and therefore browns better.  My husband hates dijon mustard and still asks for this salmon dish.  It is also wonderful cold the next day for a snack or on a nice salad!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  It's a KEEPER!",

In my oven, it only took 5-10 minutes on 400* and a few minutes under the broiler to make the top a little crispy and golden. Great recipe- I'll be making this again.",
