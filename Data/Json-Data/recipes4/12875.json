I made it for my Asian mother, who can be a tough critic when it comes to other people's cooking; she liked it so much that she actually suggested I make it again a week later when my siblings were coming to visit. I made it three times in one week and didn't even get tired of it. It is sooo delicious. I added a little bit of sriracha to one batch to give it a little heat--it was excellent.  My husband ate some of the shredded meat on tortillas with molcajete salsa--I didn't think the flavor combo would work at first, but boy was I wrong. This meat made for excellent burritos.   The flavor was so good that when chuck roasts went on sale at the local market, we stocked the freezer so that we would be able to make this roast any time.",

I sear the outsides in the pan and put it in the crock pot with the sauce ingredients. I use a little red wine to deglaze the pan and get those flavorful bits in the crock pot. Instead of celery seed I use celery stalks and sometimes add onions. I also use fresh minced ginger. To make this WAPF compliant I use coconut oil, traditionally brewed soy sauce, raw honey, and raw vinegar. I also use arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch.  I cook it on high for 3-4 hours and on low for 2-3 hours. Every time the meat is so tender it falls apart. I always make enough to have leftovers and store it in the amazing sauce. I am making this today and LOVE it.",

The soy sauce flavor in the juice was overwhelming and it was too strong to just pour all over the meat ... it was more of a dipping-type sauce.   The next time I'll cut the soy sauce down to 1/2 C and maybe add more honey.  I served with white rice and broccoli.  Not bad and worth trying again with some changes.\nUPDATE 3/13:  Made again, kept soy sauce the same but added a cup of water.  It cooked nicely but for some reason some of the meat was dry... I think that is more the cut of meat's fault rather than the recipe.  The juice was delicious, so much so that my daughter asked me to save it so she could \"drink it.\"  Yuck. As good as it was I did not comply!",
