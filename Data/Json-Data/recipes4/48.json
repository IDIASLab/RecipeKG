Perfect blend of flavors (you've gotta like onions though) and soo easy to prepare. I used deboned chicken breasts and cheddar instead then I poured all the leftover \"stuffing mixture\" on top of the finished product before popping it into the oven. It was wonderful! Next time I will try adding white wine. This is really a no-fail recipe. I'd give this six stars if I could. Thanks for sharing!",
