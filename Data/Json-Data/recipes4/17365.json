The molasses overwhelms it and mostly I just smell baked bean sauce of some kind.  The hot sauce also seems a little excessive--between hot sauce, steak sauce, Wocestershire and ground pepper, be prepared to get a real pepper kick in there.  I'm alright with that, but again, not Arby's sauce.\n\nTo cut the heavy molasses taste and the sweetness, I added more Worcestershire and steak sauce and it ended up an odd sort of BBQ sauce as I said.  Totally edible with the pulled brisket I made but not at all what I was expecting.",
