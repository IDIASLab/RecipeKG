I used black beans instead of kidney beans, added some chopped black olives, added a couple of tablespoons of corn meal as a thickener, decreased the chili powder by about a third to make it more kid friendly, and served it in some of those specialty tomato basil burritos, with some cheddar, sour cream, and taco bell mild taco sauce.  TERRIFIC!!!!!  Thanks for a great recipe, Lisa!",

Most of the fat is coming from the nutritional calculator splitting one ripe avocao into 4 servings plus the 4 T sour cream and the 2 T oil. I always use ff sour cream and I hate avocado so cutting the oil back makes this almost fat free for me (assmuing you use fat free tortillas). Since there's about 28 grams of fat by the nutritional calculator(that contribute 250 calories) taking out the avocado and using FF sc and cutting back the oil helps tremendously in making this a good light entree.",
