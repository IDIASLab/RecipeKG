I originally had made filling for homemade Beirocks but I didn't want to go through the tedious hassle of the yeast dough so I decided to make them into empanadas instead. Ground beef filling with onions cabbage and shredded carrot plus I added sliced pickled hardboiled eggs to each empanada. I used the leftover egg whites with water instead of the yolk to brush up on the outside. I'm adding a pic.",
