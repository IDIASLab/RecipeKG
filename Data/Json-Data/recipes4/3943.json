                "reviewBody": "I submitted this recipe and wanted to add some tips that were lost in editing.  Don't brown the chicken until no longer pink in the center or it will be dry upon serving.  Just carmelize all sides and when the chicken is added back into the soup later , it will then cook all the way through & still be moist.  2\" cubes for the chicken are too big, try a little smaller, but larger chunks do stay moist.  Thighs would be great too.  Only saute your garlic for 30 seconds or less!  Also, oil should always be added to a HOT pot or your food may stick.  I hope you enjoy!  Thanks for trying it!  :o)  UPDATE**  I've found that I prefer americanized chorizo, like Johnsonville's.  One of the mexican chorizos I tried lacked any texture at all and melted into a slurry with no recognizable chunks.  Since submission, I've tried this with shrimp instead of chicken & I LOVE it... much better & it's faster!  I saute 1/4c. chopped onions in the oil/butter and then start the chorizo.  I marinate the shrimp using the \"Spicy Grilled Shrimp\" from this site for about 10 min.,  just dumping the shrimp & marinade into the soup after the added cream comes to a boil. Turn off the heat, cover, & the shrimp will cook perfectly in the hot soup in about 7-10 minutes.  2 cups of minute rice thrown in with the shrimp cooks perfectly too.  It's awesome!!",

I was skeptical that the melding of the flavors would be good, but they were beyond good.  This is one of the most exceptionally good recipes I have ever tried.  My mouth waters just thinking about it.  It is on the spicy side, so it's not for the faint of heart.  Superb, stupendous and totally delicious!  My husband immediately put it in his top 5 of all time.  The ONLY thing I would change is not to add the garlic salt but rather just some more fresh garlic.  It was a bit too salty for me.  And, as the original author of the recipe said, I did cut the chicken into smaller pieces.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  I will be making it very often.",

Excellent soup.....great for the low-carber. Even my husband the soup hater said that it was really good. I know I made a couple changes here and there but it was to clean out my deep freeze and to use up some of my excess zucchini/veggies.
