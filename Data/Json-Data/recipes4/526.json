I even had to take out some of the macaroni because there wasn't enough sauce to make it as cheese as I like. \n\nI used some chedder, pepper jack & gorgonzola. I mixed it all together instead of layering. I mixed in breadcrumbs with the parmesean cheese. I added white pepper, garlic powder & onion powder. I also mixed in a lot of jalapeno peppers & a little bit of juice. My boyfriend is a jalapeno fiend.\n\nThe result is delicious! If you're expecting stovetop mac & cheese w/ processed cheese...this isn't the recipe for you! This is BAKED mac & cheese! \n\nI will add this to my notebook of recipes to make again!",

I read some of the reviews beforehand (which I highly recommend) and decided based on those to use a smaller pan so that it would not dry out (I used a Corningware 2.8 liter dish). I didn't really measure the cheese but used I'm sure more than the original recipe called for. I also added bread crumbs to the top for a twist. I followed all the other measurements exactly. The sour cream component makes the difference I think. What I like about this dish is that it's more than just a cheese sauce you melt and pour over pasta as if it were from a box. It's a real old fashioned mac and cheese bake like the ones I grew up with--very cheesy, moist. And it didn't take that long to make. I highly recommend this recipe.",

I was pretty satified with my macaroni but if I would have put more sauce in I would be extremely happy. It was ok, and the sour cream makes it taste better. I did not use any butter in my recipe, I do not think it is needed. Other than that it was a good recipe.",
