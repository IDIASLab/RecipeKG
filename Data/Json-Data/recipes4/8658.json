The person said the recipe was bland, but used turkey sausage and didn't use the Italian tomatoes - of course it is lacking some taste.  If you have to substitute that's fine - but then don't criticize the recipe.  You didn't make it like it was intended to be made.",

Made exactly as per recipe, only substituting spicy Italian sausage for sweet and basil for parsley as that's what I had to hand.

I used penne instead of the bow tie pasta and I took the advice of other reviewers and used canned Italian style diced tomatos. That saved me from a lot of chopping. Instead of heavy cream, I used half and half and used corn starch to thicken up the sauce. This made the dish a bit healthier. Since my husband loves spicy food, I used Spicy Italian Sausage and still added the crushed red pepper. When my husband ate it, he was kidding around and asking me which restaurant I purchased this from. I will definitely make this again!!!",

In addition, while sauting the onions and garlic, I added 1/2 chopped green bell pepper (maybe next time I'll add a whole one) for color and more texture.  It was wonderful.  Although all the adults found it to be the perfect amt of spice, my daughter thought it to be on the hot side.  So for her sake, I may reduce the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp.
