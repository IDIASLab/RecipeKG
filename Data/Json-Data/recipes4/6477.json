We do not add salt to this dish. We find it gets enough from the chicken stock and the soups and adding extra can overdo it. It can always be added to taste when you serve. We like it on brown rice or noodles but baked or mashed potato works well too.",

I did everything as described with the exception of being out of basil so I substituted rosemary. The result is very much stew and very meaty and rich. The chicken falls off the bones at that point. It is easy to fish out the extra bones and pieces of skin while in the pot and before serving. We had it with medium shell pasta noodles. And yes it is just as good the next day.",
