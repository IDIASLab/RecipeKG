I used brown rice so I had to cook it for about 45 minutes and then let it rest for another 10-15. In addition to the green onions I topped it off with cilantro and a few mint leaves. This will be a regular at my house but as another reviewer suggested I too would cut the amount in half. My small family liked it but I'm sure they don't want to eat the leftovers for a whole week.",

This recipe looked easy and I had all the ingredients. Well it is delicious! My only change was to use only one jalapeno since I didn't know how hot they were. Good thing because one was way enough for us. So good and so easy. I will make this again for sure. I may add peas or something it just seems like something else of vegetable form would be good.",
