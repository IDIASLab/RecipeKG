I also added sliced carrots which were also not done after 4 hours. I wasn't worried about it though since I didn't plan to serve it until dinner. I didn't brown the meat first and did add some beef base for additional flavor along with the salt and pepper and a bit of Adobo seasoning and paprika. I sampled it at lunch (minus the uncooked carrots and potatoes) and it really was good. Oh and I didn't have barley so I substituted rice in the same quantity and I used diced white onions instead of green onions. Next time I might use pasta. It's totally worth trying and using as a canvas for other ideas!",

I used 1 yellow onion chopped 6. I used about 1 Tbsp. of dried chives 7. I added about 1 Tbsp. celery salt 1 Tbsp. sea salt and 2 Tbsp. seasoned salt.
