As it turns out, it was delicious with the following adjustments for 4 servings:  1/4 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp chili powder (or to taste), 1/4 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp pepper ( or 1/2 tsp Morton's Nature Seasons.  I had a little left over white rice so added 1/4 cup to the recipe.  Garnishing the top with a few Cilantro leaves gives that extra \"mmmm\".",
