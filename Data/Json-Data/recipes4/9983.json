Hard to tell if this is the doubling or just how it is but the dough was a sticky mess (I just used the dough setting on my breadmaker and baked in the oven) and it rose easily. It almost overflowed my pullman pan but I punched it down then put it in the oven without rising again. Looked beautiful and both hubs and I liked as is with a bit of butter. Thanks for the recipe.",

It rose nicely. When I took it out to form into a loaf it was a very wet batter and I had to add about a cup more flour to get it out of the pan off my counter and to form into a loaf. I then let it rise for 40 minutes and baked at 350. The end result looks like a nice dense bread. However there is no molasses flavor. Probably adding so much more flour resulted in needing more sweetner. It is okay once you spread on some jam or Nutella.",

After reading the previous reviews I added a touch more flour before starting the machine (about one eighth C). I used Canadian all purpose instead of bread flour. I checked the dough when the machine alarmed for adding items and it was a bit dry so I added a few drizzles of water. The final result is a lovely little \"artisan\" looking loaf that has a very very slight hint of molasses flavour that you might not even notice if you didn't know it was in the mix. It is not heavy at all light with a crispy crust. Not sure if this had any effect - I always add about a tablespoon of raw sunflower seeds and half a tablespoon of ground flax to my breads. Try it you'll like it.",
