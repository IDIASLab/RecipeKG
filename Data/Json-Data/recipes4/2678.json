I will put some of each in nonstick foil, throw in fire...and you have a fantastic dinner.  Add some corn on the cob and you have a mighty fine dinner with almost no cleanup!

It's a great go-to when you have a house full of people or disjointed schedules.\n\nA few tricks.  We often have veggie trays with dinner and make foil packs, using the leftovers, the next night.  If it don't have leftovers to use, I cut up a variety of vegetables ahead of time and put them in individual plastic bags.  Everyone makes their own.\nWe just double heavy duty foil and do it envelope style.\nPotatoes cook best if they're on the bottom of the pack.\nSeason to your individual tastes.  Salt, pepper, taco seasoning, chili powder, chicken seasoning . . . \nUse chicken, ground pork, beef or chicken/turkey - whatever you like - but crumble it at the top of your pile and place a small ice cube on top.\nYou can add ketchup, steak sauce, taco or enchilada sauce to the top before sealing and .cooking",
