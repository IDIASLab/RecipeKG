We just really enjoyed this simple and healthy salad. I didn t measure the greens or pineapple just threw them into a salad bowl and then tossed with the dressing. The maple syrup provides a good contrast to the pungent vinegar sweetening it just enough perfect in my opinion. So can you tell how much we liked this??? Skonkie thanks for submitting your recipe this will be made often in this house!",
