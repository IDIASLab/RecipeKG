Pour the chili into a large casserole dish and then spread corn bread mix on top (I use 2 packages of Jiffy skip the oil to keep healthy). Tent with tin foil and bake for 45min-1 hour in the oven (I usually remove the tin foil after 30 min so the top gets brown). This is a great recipe for busy weeknights as you can prepare the chili days in advance then add corn bread mix and bake when you're ready to eat and serve.",

I also drained the black beans. My husband likes sweet chili so I added 1 tsp of sugar and some salt and pepper to taste. After the revisions I'd give it 5 stars.
