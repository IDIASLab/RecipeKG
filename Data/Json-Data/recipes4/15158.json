I diced the veggies pretty small so no problem with undercooking there. I knew chicken breast wouldn't take 20 minutes to cook so I put in the veggies to start cooking while I chopped the chicken. And I wrote \"start rice\" at the top of my recipe so I'll remember to do that next time.:) We ate it with naan bread. Thanks for the recipe.

I was surprised at the amount of chili powder and worried it would taste like a chili but it didn't. This was quite good! It makes a nice curried stew. We ate it over rice in a bowl. Even better the next day. Oh added about a tablespoon of fresh ginger and used chicken stock instead of water. (Had the stock on hand and it needed to be used.) Coconut milk instead of coconut cream. I also ignored the final two cooking times just bringing it to boil and then turning down to med-low for maybe 30 minutes--until the potatoes were cooked through.",

Coconut cream is thicker and sweet for mixed drinks normally so I used the coconut milk.
