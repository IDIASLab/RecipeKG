I boil the water and seasonings, then add the potatoes and allow to boil a few minutes before I add the processed cheese. Otherwise the cheese tends to burn and stick to the bottom of the pan. Cook on low once the cheese is added. I also wanted to note that the recipe says to use one block of cheese... If you purchase the regular sized block of Velveeta, then you actually only use 1/2 the block (1 lb) of cheese. They do have smaller 1 lb blocks of cheese you can buy as well.",

I used a 20 ounce bag of \"Simply Potatoes Southwest Style Hash Browns\" as the shredded potatoes because I had some on hand that I needed to use. And since the soup now had a \"southwestern\" flavor going I eliminated the Cajun seasoning and instead just added a few shakes of Tabasco sauce and left everything else the same as the recipe called for. This was a hit with my family even my picky teenager who told me that the next time she has a sore throat she wants me to make this comforting soup for her--if not several times before then!",

In fact the next time I make it I will use 3 cubes instead of 4. I bought 2% Milk Velveeta cheese. It's 1/3 less fat and adds a milk creaminess I like. If you add this kind Velveeta do NOT let your soup boil. It will curdle. If your soup isn't thick enough like mine wasn't add flour/water mixture and sour cream. Gave a great addl. flavor. I also used the hash brown shredded potatoes. perfect so much less work! You can add so many things to this soup I'm thinking broccoli would be a good addition too.",
