Wish I could have found the cotija but we're a little far north for that so I used a good mountain feta instead; if you go that route I'd recommend adding it to each serving as it's plated since it kind of disappears in the pan. I'd also definitely recommend not sauteeing the garlic with the onions for more than a minute or so since the heat is so high; mine was starting to burn before I could pick my spoon up off the counter. And next time I might halve the recipe since it makes a ton. Still excellent though; thanks so much!",

It's not \"oh my goodness - amazing!\" quality but definitely a nice tasty sort of weeknight side-dish. I tossed the (cheese-less) leftovers the next morning into my scrambled eggs which I enjoyed a lot (probably enough to make this dish specifically for that purpose) which made my breakfast a bit healthier due to the vegetables. Cotija cheese is available in pretty much every supermarket in southern california so I had no problems finding that but I think it would also be good with queso fresco panela or any mild and crumbly sheep's milk cheese. I don't think feta would be a good substitute as suggested by previous reviewers because it's too salty.",
