I doubled the shrimp since 1/6 pound/person seemed a little light. Might go 2 1/2 pounds next time.\n\nWith the exception of the shrimp, the proportions of the ingredients where great. Nice consistency, good presentation and very filling. Ours was served with a side of chilled asparagus.",

Next time, I would add more cheese and maybe a little red pepper flake for some heat.  I needed to add quite a bit of salt to add flavor.  Perhaps I will try the recommendation of cooking the grits in chicken stock next time to see if that adds more flavor.",
