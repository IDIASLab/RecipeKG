I was marinating my flank steak (mixture of Paul Newman's lite balsamic and Wishbone's Italian dressing) when I saw this recipe and changed directions.  I used the first batch of cherry tomatoes (red and gold) from the garden and boy were they ever so good!  Served over whole leaf romaine as it holds up better instead of the butter lettuce and added croutons for a little crunch.  HELPFUL HINT:  To kick up the flavor, try adding and reducing balsamic vinegar. To reduce your vinegar, pour into a small saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat constantly stirring to prevent scorching the vinegar. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the vinegar has reduced by half. Set aside, and cool to room temperature. When ready to serve, drizzle over the greens in place of the olive oil and balsamic vinegar the recipe calls for. NOTE: the vinegar will naturally sweeten as it reduces and will keep for months properly stored. Served with Prosciutto e Melone from AR as a starter.  Thank you cookinmama, this one's a keeper!",

I marinated the steak over night so it was well seasoned when it was time to grill. I mixed up the olive oil tomatoes mozzarella basil garlic and onion (I added those) in the morning so that the flavors would be well blended. I did use a mixture of romaine and spinach leaves as that is what I had on hand. This was very quick to pull together and made for a nice filling meal on a hot summer day. The grilling time of 5 minutes per side at medium-high temps produced a perfect 140 steak. I served this salad with Unbelievable Grilled Garlic Bread from AR and we had a delicious meal.",

I didn't bother refrigerating the caprese salad and made that last while the meat was grilling. I lightly scored the steak on both sides and cut it into four individual steaks to make grilling it a bit easier. I put the steak into a ziploc bag along with the olive oil garlic salt and pepper with just a splash or two of white wine vinegar and let it marinate for a couple of hours. I served the steak along side the lettuce and caprese salad with \"Linda's Best Ever Garlic Bread\" from this site. The only thing left was to open a nice bottle of wine and enjoy!",
