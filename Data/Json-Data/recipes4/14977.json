Also the amount of spices seemed a bit bland upon completing the dish. Keep in mind I didn't have any fresh spices-only dried ones. I did 'bloom' the cumin in the pan in oil like it said but next time I'll try 'blooming' all the spices together. I used fresh spinach which seemed to create a lot of extra water but I think if I tweak the recipe it will turn out better.",

Careful the Cuman seeds burn quickly. Needs far more salt far less water (it was way too watery so maybe half the water). When you put in blender do it on low (3 on mine) and not for very long. Otherwise it will get pasty. Also it felt kind of bland but maybe that was just the too much water causing a problem. For kids that done like spicy use about half the red chili pepper. The amount this recipe makes is not a lot. I tripped it which gave me two meals for a family of 4.",
