Whisk, whisk, whisk. After 5 minutes I tasted it, and it was floury-tasting, so I cooked it a little longer, still floury. Well, time was running short, had to proceed, so I added 2 cups of my turkey stock and the cup of pan drippings. Dear husband took a turn with whisking, then I finished, and IT TURNED INTO GRAVY! It was absolutely delicious, and it was all gone at the church Thanksgiving potluck. \nI AM A GRAVY-MAKER! (Thanks to you!)",

Brought it to a boil and whisked in the  half cup of flour.  It started to get really thick and clumpy but then I stirred in 3 cups of the turkey drippings (I had added a can of chicken broth to the bird prior to cooking) brought it to a boil, while stirring constantly  and it thickened up and tasted fantastic!  Loved it and will make it every year from now on!",
