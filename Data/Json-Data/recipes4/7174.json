This is a very good soup reminds me of a soup my Russian father used to make. A nice comforting soup good on any day but extra good on a cold or overcast day. It's a \"light\" soup but I am a \"light \" eater most days so it is my preference but I'm sure some meat could be added to make it heartier. I've made this soup twice and the only thing I did different the second time was using 10 cups of broth (I used chicken even though I'm sure good veggie broth would be good as well) instead of the water. I also sprinkled dry dill a bit of fresh pepper along with the salt and sour cream dollop just before serving. Yum!",
