Downgraded one star because the recipe just wasn't proportioned as stated.  Perhaps my breasts were larger than the author had, particularly after pounding out.  When you build the breading, use common sense - eyeball it.   I at least quadrupled the breading for 10 breasts and came out ok, but with the original calculations, it would never have had enough breading.  Kind of the same with the liquid dip.  Can't remember if I doubled or tripled, but I ended up brushing the breasts rather than dipping them.  I made it again the next day with sufficient dip and they were very flavorful.  Will make again!",
