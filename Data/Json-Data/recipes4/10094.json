My husband and I recently moved to Tel Aviv and when we went on our first Israeli date I got something very similar to this and LOVED it! I am so happy to find a recipe for it so that I can enjoy it again and again. The smoked flavor is a little strong and is somewhat unexpected especially as it is served cold - but it is very good! Don't be afraid to try it! It really makes this dish unique. The smoking instructions given here are great - I never knew how to do that - Thank you!!",
