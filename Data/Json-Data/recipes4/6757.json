I did not change the sauce recipe at all, there was no need to do so. I also chopped up some roasted peanuts for sprinkling (my sister's request).  I will make this recipe again and again and sometimes add a protein to the noodles to make it more hearty.  Thank you, SarBetEns, for this very good base recipe for a great lo mein dish.",

I couldn't even taste it, so I could have used the extra \u00bc tsp and been fine. My green onions were quite large so I added the whites along with the sauce and noodles, then saved the green parts to sprinkle on top of each serving, along with some slivered onions. Yum! UPDATE: We eat this pretty regularly, but I usually add extra veggies. It just depends what I have on hand; quartered and sliced zucchini, small broccoli florets, red peppers, just use whatever your family enjoys! I don't usually change the sauce because it's delicious as is, but once in awhile I'll add a tablespoon of lime juice. I also use \u00bd veg (canola) oil and \u00bd sesame oil when stir-frying, for a little more flavor. It's very versatile, but delicious as written!",
