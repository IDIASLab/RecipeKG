I needed to add the rest of the box and another cup of water to have enough broth. I love the combination of vegetables and the tofu. I had to use dried parsley, no problem. The flavor was very bland, so I used some seasoned salt. That helped tremendously. I felt good eating it because it feels so healthy. Just a small few tweaks and this was a delicious vegetarian soup!",
