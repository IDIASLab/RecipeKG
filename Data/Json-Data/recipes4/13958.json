A bit time consuming because of making the shredded chicken but so delicious I've made it a few times now (and I'm very picky about recipes when they take over 45 minutes to make). Achiote powder was hard to find. You might look for it under Annatto seed instead if you can't find it (it's a bright red powder). This flavor is what really makes this dish, in my opinion.",
