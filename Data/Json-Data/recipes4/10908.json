The reason some people may have found it watery is because they didn't let it simmer long enough. I usually add some rosemary, salt and pepper while it's simmering.

I made it after having a split pea and barley soup at California Pizza Kitchen.  This tastes just like it.  I add a little onion and thyme, and half an hour before the end of cooking, half a cup of barley.  It's hearty, very tasty, and I love the chewey nutty flavor of the barley.  I cook it for up to three hours, and it is never too watery for me.  If anything, it is a little too thick.  The barely, of course, absorbs some of the liquid.  This is a must try recipe!",
