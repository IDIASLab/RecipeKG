I was definitely not disappointed. I added a little bit of smoked paprika along with the chili powder and used light cream cheese. You could definitely add some Mexican blend cheese or Cheddar if you like - when it comes to cheese and eggs wrapped in a tortilla the more the better! You just can't go wrong here. Thanks for a great recipe Seattle Dad!",

Instead of using sausage my mom uses bacon and i use scrapple. Either way it just depends on what kind of meat you like. Also we make tons of these at a time and wrap them in tin foil and freeze them. Its great for kids to just pop in the microwave. Also you may have a problem finding green chili i know we do in Maryland but it is a must DO NOT substitute we order ours online.",

First I used only 1 medium sized Yukon Gold potato (they are the lowest in carbs) and used egg substitute to cut fat and cholesterol. I use either veggie chorizo or ground chicken chorizo depending on what's available which is similar in flavor and texture but is so much lower in fat and calories. I skipped the cream cheese because we don't care for the texture and substitute monterey jack or queso fresco. Finally I use \"fajita size\" tortillas in place of burrito sized because we just don't want that large of a meal. I admit it's not the original recipe I've described but it's quite tasty with the replacements and I don't feel guilty about about enjoying one of these!",
