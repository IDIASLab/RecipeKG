Tonight I tried this one and it was DELISH! I didn't have green peppers so doubled the onions. I didn't have Parmesan cheese so used mozerella baby creamy Swiss and Colby Jack. I didn't have enough tomato sauce so the bottom is a little dry (my fault). The flavor was awesome even if my consistency fur to lack of ingredients was off. I did take off the aluminum foil once I heard it boiling for about 3 1/2 minutes. So I can only imagine with the right ingredients this will be awesome!!!! Very Happy Chef!",
