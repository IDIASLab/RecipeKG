I did use chicken tenders, so I checked them after cooking on low for about 4-1/2 hours and they were done, so I put them on warm for about an hour and then shredded them...perfectly tender, moist and flavorful! After shredding, I did spoon a bit of the sauce over it so it would stay moist and that worked great. topped each wrap w/ some of the cooking juice (which was delicious) and a bit of shredded cheddar. This is a keeper, for sure~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)",
