I'm sure it was due to the fish sauce (check out the sodium content on the bottle!) so if I were to make this again I would just omit it.  Any flavor it may impart is not worth that huge amount of salt!  I did use low-sodium soy sauce and added a little extra coconut milk.  I'm sure this would be really good if it weren't so darn salty.  I even reduced the amount of fish sauce to one TBS!  I used a red onion, which added nice color.

I added broccoli, didn't have green onions, used coconut paste (no coconut milk), and tweaked the measurements of the other ingredients to compensate for the sweetness of the coconut paste. My wife was not a fan of the spice (I thought it was perfect) but my 2 year old couldn't get enough! I will definitely make this again. Maybe I'll pull some aside for my wife without spice.",

As soon as my basils grow out, I will make this again, but either use more fresh basil, or add some dry basil too.

I followed the recipe exactly otherwise but ended up adding a little more soy sauce and quite a lot more red pepper flakes. To be honest I wasn't sure if it was even going to make it to the table (the flavor was just really peculiar plus it didn't help I was making it with the most flavorless watery coconut milk I have ever bought) but as soon as I added the basil it really came together. I only wish I'd been able to get Thai basil at the store. With a couple of tweaks this could be really amazing. Thanks Gabrielle!",
