I added 1/2 cup of milk and used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead. If my kids even think a mushroom has been in the same room as their food they run!  lol  I also used the drop biscuit recipe from Bisquick as the topping.  The family loved it and it was quick and easy to make.  Thanks for this great, quick and easy way to use up those leftovers!",

I was making this for a group of 6 so I bought two deep dish pie crusts (which I pre-baked in the oven for 10 mins to get it little crispier) didn t think about the top. Stores were closed so I had to think fast...I had two Pillsbury Crescent Roll tubes in the fridge. I laid it out and pinched it all closed. I put it over the top of the pies I then only had to bake them for 20 mins at 375 and the top was golden brown and crispy. I didn t even have to add the aluminum foil as I brought the Pillsbury dough right over top of the pie shell sides. Needless to say nothing was left.....only the compliments.",
