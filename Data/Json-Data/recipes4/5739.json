We love France and French cooking, and this recipe is a wonderfully simple, elegant cassoulet that even I can make and he loves. Wonderful for cold nights and dinner parties.

Made on stove top; did not use bacon; added three carrots and three ribs of celery; used two cans diced tomatoes with liquid; added ground sage and fennel seed. I really can't imagine the canned great northern beans cooking for that long in the newer crockpots which run so hot. I cooked the onions celery and carrots then added the chicken. After chicken was cooked added tomatoes beans and seasonings and simmered for about thirty minutes. Thanks for the recipe!",

I was going to say that it needed more beans, but I just realized that I'd read the recipe wrong and thought it called for one can, not three.  I happened to have chicken quarters on hand, so I used them, then removed the skin when it fell off.  Made it a bit fattier, perhaps.  My husband's suggestion was to add the sausage more at the end - he thought it got overcooked in the crockpot.  Thanks for a great recipe!",

I made this recipe using turkey bacon, turkey kielbasa and chicken thighs.  My husband LOVED it! He couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  I reserved the liquid from both the beans (only used 2 cans) and the tomatoes and i ended up adding some of the tomato liquid back in.  I browned the turkey kielbasa after i cooked the turkey bacon and before i sauteed the onions.  I also left out the tomato paste (didn't have any in the pantry) and it still came out great. Next time i think i'll leave out the chicken and just use the turkey bacon and turkey kielbasa.  I cooked it on high as someone else suggested for about and hour and then turned down to low for another hour and a half.  The beans were soft but not mushy and everything was cooked through.  I'm sure the leftovers will be great if they don't get eaten in the middle of the night.  Overall great dish and i will be making again and again.",

I loved that it was easy, and the house smelled amazing when it was in the slow cooker.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was very good, but I agree with previous reviews that it was a little on the bland side.  I would try it again using a can of seasoned diced tomatoes - fire roasted, or with spices.  I think that would help the flavor.  I used Bush's Great Northern Beans, Del Monte diced tomatoes, and turkey/beef/pork smoked sausage.  Mine was done at 4 hours on low.",

My slow cooker has a clay pot (which cooks faster) and I don't know if that helped with the flavors but I'm sure it didn't hurt. Like many recipes, the flavor only gets better as a leftover dish. I serve it with a cheesy sourdough bread. I highly recommend this Cassoulet slow cooker recipe. Thank you, Smart Cookie, for submitting it.",
