I mean it is okay to eat, but it is really bland. Have you tasted it yet?\" I was shocked as all the previous reviews said it was an excellent recipe. I took a taste and completely agreed with him. With all the ingredients in it I was amazed at the lack of taste. I used Zataran Spanish rice mix, which I feared may be too spicy, and deli style salsa not jarred. I don't know if that had anything to do with the final results. I saved the dish by adding a lot of chili powder, a good dusting of Goya seasoning and some cumin. I also mixed in a few slices American cheese till it was melted through. I hate giving a recipe such a low rating, but I cannot rate it high if the flavor is flat and bland. ",
