I made it the first time without making any variations. The second time I made a few modifications and it made it even more flavorful. I used heirloom tomatoes (de-seeded) and peeled eggplant both times. The second time, in addition to the recipe as written, I sprinkled garlic salt and Italian Seasoning blend over the tomatoes and eggplant. I then sprinkled 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan (not the kind from a can) and 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese on top. Baked 25 minutes, which was enough. This is a perfect recipe to add veggies into a family meal (always a challenge) and use fresh summer produce. Thank you for this recipe!",

I also lowered the temp to 375, and after baking for 40 minutes sprinkled shredded mozzarella on the eggplant slices and broiled for the remaining 10 minutes. \nThis was absolutely delicious! I love eggplant but am not a fan of frying or breadcrumbs so I was thrilled to come across this recipe. What a super way to have a meatless meal. I bought some good semolina bread so the next day my husband made himself a hero with the leftover eggplant. I will definitely be adding this to my cooking repertoire...thanks Jezz and thanks to all the other posters for adding some great ideas.",

                "reviewBody": "Absolutely loved finding a non-breaded recipe and was surprised how delicious! This will be my go-to for summer bumper crop eggplant. Thank you so much for sharing--love, love, love this!\n\nPreparation Must and would eliminate several of the soggy and bitterness reviews I read. As with all eggplant recipes, the key is to sweat the eggplant first. Do this by skinning, slicing, and heavily salting (I use canning salt) and let set for at least 30 minutes -- all the excessive water and bitterness will bubble out. Then rinse thoroughly  and squeeze out all the excessive water with clean tea towel or paper towels.  Then proceed with the recipe.\n\nTip: bake on stoneware and eliminate the cooking spray. I baked 35 minutes at 400, no broiling required for nice brown crunchy Parmesan. Resist the urge to put mozzarella on as some reviews suggested as it's the browned Parmesan that is so very very good. I also put Parmesan between  the eggplant and tomato--yes, I love Parmesan!\n\nSeasoning Variations: use Italian seasonings (mixture of oregano, basil, thyme), garlic powder, minced up jalapeno between the eggplant and tomato.",
