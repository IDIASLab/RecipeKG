The chef recommended it over penne. When I tried it I wished I could make this at home. I found the recipe here and it was FANTASTIC! It was better then the italian place! I add chicken stock instead of the water and I still use the boullion. I like the sauce a little thicker so while it's simmering down a bit, i add a LITTLE flour water mixture while stirring the pan. AND, the kicker that puts it over the top....LEMON JUICE. Squeeze some fresh lemon juice in the pan. SO GOOD YOU WILL CRY. So far, I made this three times and had a total of 17 people try it (i make HUGE amounts of it at a time, usually three pans cooking at once). EVERYONE loved it and they were SO impressed!",

I salted and peppered the chicken before browning, and made sure not to cook it quite completely so that it would not overcook once returned to the sauce.  I used fresh rosemary rather than the dried, as I believe it imparts an entirely different and more subtle flavor.  Served on a bed of tri-color angel hair pasta, this was as good a dish as I've had anywhere.  ",

It contains chicken on the bone cut or chopped into bite size pieces, along with chunks of Italian sweet and hot sausage, chunked up mushrooms, whole garlic cloves, potatoes cut into small chunks, lots of black pepper, lemon juice, fresh rosemary sprigs, and olive oil. All the main ingredients are browned on the stove then finished in the oven in a casserole and seasoned to taste. With a salad and fresh bread, it's a meal all by itself. \"Scarpariello\" means shoemaker in Italian, and this signifies that the dish is rustic in origin and makes use of whatever is handy in the kitchen. So it's pretty open-ended. If you use chicken cutlets, lemon and garlic, it's \"picatta\" - piquant. Nothing is considered wrong in how the dish is made because the results are always \"right\"!!",

You'll see the juice run out if you slice it after it is cooked and you can also fan out the slices(cut on a bias)over the pasta or rice. Also forget the shallots as they are super expensive use red onion. also forget bouillion as it is loaded with salt home made chicken stock is the way to go; after the chicken is done remove from pan reduce the sauce by 1/2 and swirl in raw butter to finish the sauce. Nape oner the chicken and enjoy.",
