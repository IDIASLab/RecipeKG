I served with grilled chicken but would be great with tilapia or fish tacos. I am from texas so added more jalapenos but only because they are mild now in winter. Also added another tomatoe (4 if it was full recipe). Might have been size of romas though. I think the fine dicing is critically important. Am thinking of adding cabbage to this recipe and serving as slaw with some additional tweaks. Very good and a bit different than the norm",
