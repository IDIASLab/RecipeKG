Here are my changes and suggestions. I added a small chopped onion and 3 minced garlic cloves to the ground beef while browning. I used 10 ounces of ground beef and 6 ounces chorizo. This was really the only spice in this casserole. If made again I'd add chili powder and cumin in addition to the chorizo. I would also leave the foil OFF the last 10 minutes of cooking as the casserole was a little too soupy for our preference. PAM made clean-up a breeze!",
