I cut the cloves of garlic in half lengthwise, fried them in the oil until fragrant, and then followed the recipe with the exception of using green beans and pre-steamed carrots along with the yellow squash.  I put them in a casserole dish and continued to roast them in the oven until done.  The end result is so incredible that my \"I hate carrots and squash\" 6 year old asked for more!  The garlic lended a nutty flavor and the whole dish is simple yet amazing.  DEFINITELY a keeper!  Thank you for the soon to be staple in our house!",
