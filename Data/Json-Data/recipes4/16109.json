I also added the mushrooms the last 20 minutes because someone in the house can pick them out (does not like mushrooms). This kept the mushrooms more firm.

I put the chicken strips into a freezer bag with 3 packets of McCormick Chicken Marsala seasoning mix and mixed it well coating all the chicken. I laid the chicken strips on top of the mushrooms in the crock pot. Then I added the wine (which I boiled for 2 minutes prior) and 2 cans of beef broth. I cooked all of this on low for about 5 hours. I added the cornstarch and water at the end which made a wonderful gravy. I served this with mashed potatoes and sweet peas. Everyone went back for seconds including my kids.",
