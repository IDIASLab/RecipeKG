        "description": "Chicken simmered in a sweet (marmalade) and spicy (Sriracha) sauce. Lots of flavor. Great over rice. This recipe is best when the chicken has cooked so long that it looks shredded. It really absorbs the flavors better that way. You could probably substitute beef or pork for chicken. I haven't tried that yet. I'm really interested in seeing what someone with some slow cooking experience can do with this recipe. Could you put everything in a slow cooker and come back to dinner in 6 hours or would the marmalade be a bad idea in a slow cooker?",

I did use 1/2 cup of orange juice in place of half of the water. I liked the results and would do so again next time. I liked that the chicken wasn't breaded or fried. Because I served this over sticky rice I wanted extra sauce so I made another half batch of the sauce. This is very good as is but the next time I will add steamed veggies toward the end of the simmering time to add a little bulk. We love fresh veggies in Asian food and they would be delicious with this sauce. I would add matchstick carrots and broccoli and green pepper. If you are looking for a spicier dish because of the Sriracha 2 tsp. will not be enough to notice. I added 2 1/2 TBS and it was slightly detected. My DH and SIL added extra Sriracha to their dish once it was plated. Thanks for sharing your recipe ppm it will be made again in our house.",

I used BLSL thighs cut to bite size pieces but that was my only change. The next time I think I will toss the chicken bites in cornstarch before I cook them so they get slightly crisp. I know the submitter was thinking more along the lines of a shredded texture but we thought this worked very well. Thanks for sharing!",

I followed the recipe except for subbing 1/2 cup orange juice for half the water increasing the sriracha to 2 Tbsp and adding a corn starch slurry at the end to thicken. So what changes will make this better? Sub all orange juice for the water and reduce the soy sauce to 1/4 cup. While I didn't find the recipe as-written overtly over salty I did find that the salt wasn't quit subtle enough for my taste. I think the substitution of orange juice for the water (thanks Molly for the idea) only intensifies the orange flavor. I will be making this again with sticky rice and steamed veggies it makes a good addition to our dinner rotation. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",

I would think that apricot jam would also be good in place of the marmalade. This makes good leftovers. I will make this again! Thanks princesspottymouth!",

My granddaughter said it was \"too orangey\" and she really likes oranges! \"Sweet\" is in the title of this recipe and we adults did think it was too sweet for our taste.
