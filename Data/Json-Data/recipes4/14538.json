I created this recipe for a camping trip to put on back loin ribs and  people kept coming by and asking me what that amazing smell was, and all 8 racks were gone within 10 minutes after coming off the grill. It's great on: pork ribs/loin/chops/burgers, chicken, beef ribs/burgers/steak, and lamb burgers.",

Be sure to wear gloves while working with the chiles and don't touch your face. I could not find plain mango juice and I did not feel like making my own so I used mango nectar. (Nicola--was this a deal breaker?) Then I pretty much followed the recipe as written. I must say that after the week was over the onions were pretty pungent. I ended up with a little over 1 quart of sauce. Slathered it on pork ribs and they were very good. I still had plenty left over and I poured the remainder into ice cube trays and froze. I could not tell any difference between say day 3 and day 7 in the refrigerator so if I make this again I might just let the mixture sit in the refrigerator for less time.",
