My modifications: Used half field greens and half baby spinach Threw in a handful of walnuts because I had them around Roasted the beets drizzled in a garlic-infused olive oil. I used kosher salt and black pepper to season both beets and avocado-made a huge difference-don't forget this step! Used the same garlic-infused olive oil to drizzle on the avocados and also make the salad dressing. Threw in two cloves of garlic (pressed from my garlic presser) right into my salad dressing Used sliced almonds with dried cranberries instead of pistachios and dried cherries Skipped all cheese to save on calories-and is a great vegan friendly choice",
