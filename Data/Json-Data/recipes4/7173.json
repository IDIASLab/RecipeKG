I had some Bacon-Bleu Cheese Balls from this site left over from the other day and I felt that was close enough to make this recipe using that. Without the bacon in the cheese ball I'm not sure there would have been enough flavor in this dish as written. Even then it needed some salt and pepper added to it and I even sprinkled a little of Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute (an herb mixture) on the chicken. As I cooked it according to the recipe this turned out very nicely with those additions. I also had some leftover rice/vermicelli mixture from the other day (SHORECOOK's A Homemade San Francisco Treat from this site) to use. So we were totally happy with this dinner tonight. Thank you Elizabeth Saben!",
