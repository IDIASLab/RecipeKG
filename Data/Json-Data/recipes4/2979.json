My husband is a fan of bratwurst and since this had so few ingredients and looked so simple I thought I'd give this a try. On top of that there's no shortage of beer in this house so I was able to convince my husband to give up a bottle - LOL. So for a package of 5 brats I used one bottle vs. two with one whole onion thick sliced and half ketchup half tomato-based chili sauce along with some minced garlic and a bit of dry mustard. I cooked this on high for 4 hours and they really didn't need to be finished on the grill because they were done. I thickened up the \"sauce\" that was in the crock pot with a little cornstarch and by leaving the top off. Overall my husband thought they were pretty good on rolls.",
