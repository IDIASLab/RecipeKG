I used all of the ingredients as directed but added about 2 TBSP of honey. I did not use our dutch oven though I lined a glass pan with foil and covered it with foil. I baked it at 375 for 2 hours. then uncovered on Broil for 5 minutes and it was soooo soooo juicy my husband pulled the bone right out of it! It was so easy to whip up all the ingredients too. Try this! The flavor was great and not overpowering at all. OH I JUST remembered I did add one bouillon cube instead of poultry seasoning.",
