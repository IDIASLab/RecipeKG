                "reviewBody": "11/30/2012: I made this for 17 people on Thanksgiving and it was a hit! I used 2 acorn squash and 2 butternut squash and increased the other ingredients accordingly. The only change I made was 2% milk instead of half'n'half. Delicious! The leftovers were a popular choice for lunch and dinner the next day. It was just as good left-over as it was fresh and it was good served cold as well as hot. 10/17/2016 update: I've made this more times than I can count now but tonight for the first time I substituted buttercup squash for the acorn squash and the soup was incredible! You can't seem to make a bad soup with this recipe using any kind of winter squash but my new favorite is buttercup. So sweet and delicious. I always sub 2% milk for the half 'n' half and tonight also substituted coconut oil for the butter and that worked fine too. Thanks FutureChefShay for this wonderful recipe! 09/23/18 update: I forgot to mention that Andouille sausage makes a great addition to this soup. I cut a 13 oz Smithfield fully cooked one into bite sized chunks and stir it in after I pur\u00e9e the soup then let it sit 5 minutes to heat up the sausage before serving.",
