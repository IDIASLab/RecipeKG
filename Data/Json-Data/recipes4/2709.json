I doubled the beef used frozen shredded hash browns instead of patties and added onion to the beef while it was cooking. I omitted the green beans and jalapeno. I cooked 4 slices of bacon and crumbled that into the beef/hash brown mix as well as garlic and chili powder and half a can of cheese soup. I halved the peppers and prepared them as noted in the directions. Once the peppers were stuffed I topped each one with the remaining cheese soup and some shredded cheddar. When done I topped the peppers with sour cream and served. It was delicious! A good alternative to the traditional stuffed peppers.",

I found the mixed ingredients looked a bit dry and uninviting so added the better part of a can of Heinz tomato soup to moisten and flavou - I think this was an important addition as it held it all together. I also added about a tsp of cumin instead of just a pinch. My kids usually only like peppers raw on a veggie plate or in Greek Salad so this was a victory. The 10 min. soak in boiling water nicely prepared the peppers for a quick baking but they were still firm enough to stuff. I will try stuffing them with Spanish Rice on another occasion. Thanks for the inspiration!",

I usually have more filling left over than will fit inside the bell peppers so we eat the leftovers with corn tortillas. Sometimes I add a little chopped bell pepper and then dispense with stuffing the filling into whole chopped peppers and we eat it ALL with the tortillas. I found that this recipe is best with mild anaheim peppers - Anaheims are slightly spicy just enough to add some warmth but not enough to burn your mouth. Green bell peppers are pretty good too. I didn't like it with sweet red peppers however.",
