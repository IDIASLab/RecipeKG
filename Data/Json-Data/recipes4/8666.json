                "reviewBody": "I first made these in 2003 and they've been a staple for my appetizer parties ever since. I use a combination of sweet and hot sausage which because it can be hard to break up during cooking after draining I put in the food processor for a couple pulses. That way it has nice even texture. I also use a combination of pineapple salsa and sweet hot pepper & onion relish both of which gave it a hint of sweetness and zing. Between the hot sausage and the relish it has a real bite. The sour cream cuts that though. I always use a pastry bag to apply the sour cream; makes it neat quick and easy. A make-ahead tip is to pre-bake the wonton skins using a small wooden pastry dowel to press them GENTLY into the tin sprayed with Pam. Spray the skins lightly prior to baking and watch them in the oven; they can burn quickly. I then use a small scoop to fill the cups with the sausage mixture that I warmed up separately. This way you can make both days ahead (store the cooled cups in a resealable bag) then assemble just prior to plating. The thing I love about these is the texture...crunchy (from skins above the muffin rim) and chewy (part encasing the sausage).",

The only problem I had was that although I drained and rinsed the sausage the appetizers still tasted a little greasy as they cooled a bit. I am not really a fan of sausage anyway so that could have contributed to my 'picky-ness'. I think that this is a great idea and will try other fillings. Seasoned and grilled chicken would be wonderful. Beef taco filling would be good. Or even doing a crab rangoon filling and topping with sweet and sour might be worth a try. What about all diced veggies (peppers onions mushrooms etc.) that have been tossed with a little seasoned olive oil and topped with parmesan after baking? The possibilities are endless.",

I left off the sour cream and green onion and prepared a simple dipping sauce of sour cream and taco seasoning for them instead.  I also used plain ground pork and a very mild salsa which made them very kid friendly.  The second batch I made with Seasoned pork and hotter salsa.  Next time I will go back to the plain ground pork and rely on the salsa for the seasoning.  MAKE THESE!  You will receive lots of praise!",

Also took the advice of another reviewer and pulsed the sausage in my food processor a couple of times just to get an even crumble. I also mixed the sausage salsa & cheese earlier in the day - then just popped it in the micro for a couple of minutes filled the shells and re-heated for about 6 minutes just to re-warm the shells. I got 34 out of this recipe instead of 24 - just a heads up for others. Nice appetizer and will make again. Thanks.",
