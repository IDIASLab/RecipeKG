I would recommend pounding the chicken very thin slicing the mushrooms and ham very thin to make prettier chicken rolls. Also I only had three chicken breasts but I used the same amount of all the rest of the ingredients and I'm glad I did because the sauce and fillings are wonderful.",

All I could find for the chilies were dried ones but I still destemmed and emptied the seeds as much as possible and still boiled them for about 30 seconds. I think this is a great recipe for three chicken breasts and if you're going to make six double up on the stuffing and really stuff those breasts!! I'll probably make it again it just takes a lot of time to prepare. Thank you for sharing!",
