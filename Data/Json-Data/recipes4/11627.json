I omitted the swiss cheese although I'd like to try it with next time. I will definately make again but next time I'll cut back on the amount of pepper (a little too hot for me but it'd be great for pepper-lovers).",

The recipe needed to have salt added.  I added about 1 1/2 tsp. and that wasn't really enough.  I also added about 1/4 cup flour to thicken it up a little more.  That came out about right.  All in all it was a pretty good recipe, but probably would have been better with the puff pastry.  The Swiss cheese was a nice added touch.  Update:  Made this again with the puff pastry.  Made two casseroles.  One I put the pastry on and let it sit on the hot filling a while before baking.  Don't do that--it didn't puff very well.  The other casserole puffed much better.  So I learned some things about puff pastry in this experiment.  Think I'd prefer the regular pie crust as a topping on these pot pies, so don't know that I'd try the puff pastry again.",

Here is what I did reduced it to 2 cups chicken broth and added one can of cream of chicken soup substituted onion flakes with minced onions. about a tablespoon substituted pepper sauce with cayenne pepper. about half a teaspoon substituted the carrots and potatoes with one 15 oz can of mixed vegetables. substituted puff pastry with a pie crust Other than these changes I followed the recipe. Cant wait to make it again.",
