There was NO cumin in this recipe.  Most chili recipes call for cumin.  No beer either.  Guess that's what happens when you follow the recipe EXACTLY and not make any adjustments from reviewers (minor adjustment was to only add 5 drops of tabasco instead of 10). I figured since it said \"Award Winning\" that meant something.  I guess not everyone has the same tastes when it comes to chili's.  I have made SEVERAL chili recipes from this site and they have enjoyed all of them on star level of 4 or 5.",

I wanted to stick to ChefJimmy's recipe but ended up playing with it just a little...I always fry my spice off with the onion to avoid any raw chili taste - this also seems to intensify the flavours. About 10 mins on a low heat does the trick. I used a red and yellow pepper as I am not a fan of green. I added cumin and cinnamon simply because I LoVe those flavours. I added more tinned tomarto because we like our chili a little soupy... This clings to the pasta I serve it on. My only other addition was a handful of coriander again because I LoVe the flavour. Served topped with a good sharp greated cheese and sour cream. This is the best chili I have ever made and it is much, much better than mine. Thanks ChefJimmy! Hope you don't mind all the additions!

The flavor was phenomenal (I tried the cinnamon idea from below which gave it a yummy kick) and it was pretty easy to make. The only problem was that it was ridiculously thick even after adding all the additional tomato juice. My husband laughed when I told him that we were supposed to add the flour and cornmeal at the end to \"thicken it up\" since it was already almost dough-y anyway. Since I'm pretty new to the whole cooking business I was afraid to add anything for fear that I would ruin the flavor. Any suggestions for an easy way to thin it out while retaining the flavor?",
