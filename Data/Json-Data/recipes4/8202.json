Use it anytime an adult macaroni and cheese would fit the meal, and you won't be disappointed. As a side note, this tastes even better as rewarmed leftovers than it does fresh out of the oven, so make enough to take for lunch tomorrow!",

I have a feeling with these changes it'll be 5 stars. UPDATE: I made this again this time quadrupling the pears and cutting the salt and Italian Seasoning in half. The pear taste was strong but it was still bland. I think next time I will double the pears and add a splash of balsamic to the pears before putting them in the mix.",
