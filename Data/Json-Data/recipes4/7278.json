I followed the ingredients exactly except I only had sweetened applesauce so I used that and omitted the honey (I later used the honey to top the pancakes- they have too good of flavor to smear with syrup). I do have a couple tips for cooks who had problems flipping the pancakes: I used a cast iron griddle, preheated, on med heat. When I spooned the batter I spread it out a little so the upper side dries a bit and when you flip there isn't any runny batter. Lastly be patient, cook first side past golden to brown (better flavor that way too). I was able to make 6\" to 7\" pancakes with no problems. Will definitely make again, wanna try variations of toppings and add ins. Thanks for the yummy, healthy, filling recipe!",
