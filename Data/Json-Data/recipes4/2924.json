                "reviewBody": "Great alternative to the overly sweet sweetpotato dishes! I do suggest that you do not waste time in roasting the potatoes - way too much time and effort. If you have a pot with a steam basket try this: Fill pot with water (up to about 2 inches below basket) & start heating it up on the stove. While your water is heating peel and cut your potatoes into pieces - as uniform as possible - so it cooks evenly. By the time you are done prepping the water should be just about boiling. Just fill up the basket with your potatoes and place the lid on. It took me about 10 minutes to steam mine because I cut it into about 1/2 inch squares. You will be able to tell when they are tender enough to mash in the processor and you don't have to wait for them to cool down like you would with baking! Makes the whole first step take about 20 minutes versus 90. I also added about a dozen drops of red pepper sauce (tapatio or you could use tabasco) - not enough to make it spicy just to impart more depth to the flavor.",

I wrapped the potatoes in foil and put them in the oven while my turkey was baking. After taking out and resting the turkey I popped the casserole into the oven to bake making this so convenient to make and not taking up oven space. I loved the subtle sweetness and the blend of flavor with the orange and ginger. I did add some candied ginger to the food processing of ingredients and liked that alot. With the addition of the egg this puffed up nicely. The crunch of the roasted pecan added wonderful flavor and texture. I was tempted to sub out some of the oj for some bourbon but I decided I will try that next time. I love sweet potatoes with a holiday meal but up to this point I usually baked them because of being so turned off by 'dessert casseroles'. One could add honey if the sweet potato was not sweet enough. I also used fat free plus milk which is skim but has the taste and appearance of 2%. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!",

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. It is similar to the old standard combination of sweet potatoes and orange juice but has some added body from the eggs and milk. I used the juice and zest from two whole oranges and the casserole had a nice orangy flavor. Next time I might add more ginger as I didn't taste that much.",

                "reviewBody": "The 4 star review is for the recipe not the dish. I followed the recipe exactly and I think it has a lot of unneccessities that could be removed to streamline it. For instance when the potatoes came out after they were roasted the great roasted flavor ws there but after mashing them with eggs oj and rebaking it left so I think even microwaving it instead of roasting would make no difference to cut down on the time. Additionally I don't feel the egg made any contribution. The sweet potatoes didn't taste any different or puff up for me...so I think they could have been omitted. And the ginger could be tripled at least to make it come out more( candied ginger sounds like a great idea) I'm a sweet potato freak but I always only eat it plain with a little coconut or spicy onions and so I was expecting my first casserole to taste vastly different but this was nice subtly orange mashed sweet potatoes. I love the orange flavor...in the morning topped with leftover cranberry sauce...fabulous breakfast:) Oh and I eat it cold...orange flavor's much more pronounced. I tried it few other ways...with butter( didn't like that) and with plain yogurt and a drizzle of molasses. Molasses was unnecessary but the yogurt was very good with the potatoes...but then again I'm a plain yogurt freak;)",
