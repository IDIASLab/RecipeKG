This wrap was very good and for me a great way to use up leftover herb grilled chicken so I didn't bother with the whole marinating/grilling process. I love sun-dried tomatoes and mine are in a \"ready to eat\" pouch so no boiling here either! I opted for a creamy ranch style dressing to compliment this and it tasted great! This was quick easy and perfect for lunch!",

Next time I would marinate them in the dressing called for but I think I would mix the cooked chicken spinach etc with a ranch or maybe just mayonnaise something cream based. Or maybe I was supposed to use a cream based sundried tomato dressing. I wasn't sure so picked up one that was oil-based and very red! But let me say I tasted the chicken straight out of the oven and that dressing is a great marinade just to serve the chicken plain. I marinated mine 10 hours and the chicken was incredible tender & juicy.",
