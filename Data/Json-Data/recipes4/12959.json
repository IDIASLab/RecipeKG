Since it was better the second day, this might be a candidate for a make-ahead dish. And, oh yeah, it makes A LOT!",

My son needed me to make it for his German class on the day they were sampling the foods of Germany.  I spiced it up by melting some butter in a pan, adding the spaetzle with sauerkraut and then sprinkling some parmesan cheese on it.  That made it taste awhole lot better, but probably not as authentic as it is in Germany.

I chopped up 4 slices of thick cut bacon and an onion to fry up in butter to saut\u00e9 the sp\u00e4tzle in afterwards, which came to three batches in my big pot of boiling water. \n\nI'm figuring that the complaints about the blandness of this dish come because of the relatively small amount of sauerkraut - I used this half recipe of sp\u00e4tzle with the same amount as given here. Mixed it all up in the pan and fried it together for a few minutes until all piping hot, then served with grilled bratwurst. Lovely!",
