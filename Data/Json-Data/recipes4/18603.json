It needs to be something with a sufficiently resilient texture, like crawfish tails, or shrimp, or crab, or lobster claw meat (tails would get too tough) or frog legs or alligator.   I've even seen it made with monkfish or gaspergou (aka \"drumfish\").  Anything oily, like tarpon, or flaky, like catfish, is just going to fall apart and get lost in the sauce.",
