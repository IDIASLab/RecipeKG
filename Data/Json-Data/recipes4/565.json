Any leftover white bark coating is great mixed with a little peanut butter and dropped in small wafers on waxed paper to harden. They may stay slightly soft but just melt in your mouth, mmmm...\r\nThese are also great made with peanut butter sandwich cookies (cheap store brand work great)and using creamy peanut butter for part of the cream cheese and dip in milk chocolate coating.",

So I made it easier--I melted the chocolate and coated the bottom of a candy paper (like Reese's PB Cups) and then put the ball in and covered it with chocolate.  Much faster, better to look at than the balls with dripping chocolate everywhere and the taste is the same!  Great recipe!!!  No need for chilling the dough when you do it this way either!",

I made lots of small balls.  I had to use more of the vanilla candy coating (ALSO CALLED ALMOND BARK).  If my wife had not told me to look for Almond Bark I would not have found it.  Anywho...gggreattt.  Fantastic.  I took some to work so I would not get even fatter and many said they were the best of all time!  Fairly easy, very good, very fattening, tell the pig at work that they are cut off at five!\r\n",
