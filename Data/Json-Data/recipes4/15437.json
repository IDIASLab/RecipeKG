I think if I make this again I would use white cranberry juice and and maybe 1 teaspoon of blueberry jello.  The color is so heavy you can't see into the bowl.  The fish have to be pressed up against the side of the glass in order to see them.  Can't see the celery I used for plant life either.  Cute idea just needs some adjusting.",
