This is because when the first nations people were first in existance they did not have butter.  Therefore, they could not use butter.  They only had in their food stores, shortening, flour, baking powder, and salt.  Water was near by so this is what went into their main staple of food.  They ate banic at every meal, and sometimes this is all they ate for a meal.  This was depending on how good the hunting was.  Milk was never used because this turns the dough white.  Usually it was cooked over an open fire or baked in the oven.  The oven should be turned up to a high temperature.  In my house we do not time it we just go by the smell and the color.",

I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and 1/4 c peanut oil (poured off from a jar of natural peanut butter) because I didn't have any butter. As the bread baked I got a little bit of peanut aroma but there was only a hint of peanut flavor in the finished bread. I also used non-fat dried milk powder (mixed in about 1/2 c with the water and oil). It was very tasty and I plan on making this again substituting unsweetened applesauce for the butter/oil to reduce the fat.",
