Then the liquid is poured over the bread so it soaks up and gets a little soggy. The meat placed on top of the bread. The recipe creator is correct it is very rare that you will have left overs but if you do which happens on occasion it is even better heated up the next day. The only thing our family does that is a little different is I add a cup to 2 cups of white wine about an hour before the end of cooking. I also add a small can of tomato sauce or about 1/2 cup of ketchup to the liquid at the start. I like to rub and coat the meat with the dry spices. Also after pouring in enough water to cover I also like to created a spice ball using whole cloves allspice berries pickling spices a cinnamon stick whole cumin seeds which I wrap in cheese cloth and let float around in the bottle as it cooks.",

I see other recipes for this festival meal call for collard greens so next time I'll try it with them rather than cabbage. I don't remember it being so very filling, but my husband and I loved every bite. Any tips on clarifying the broth would be appreciated. My broths always become cloudy. Very annoying.",
