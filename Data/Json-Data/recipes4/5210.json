This is good according to me. According to them it is outrageously delicious! They absolutely loved it and not a bit was leftover! I used my homemade seasoned breadcrumbs but still went ahead a seasoned as the recipe states. Like other reviewers I used olive oil to moisten the crumbs. Instead of laying the fish on the foil lined baking sheet I lightly sprayed a cooling rack with Pam placed that on the baking sheet and put the fish on the rack. This resulted in crispy fish on both sides and also allowed the fish to be easily moved to a plate without leaving any of the coating behind. I served this with a dollop of goat cheese and herb ice cream for dipping. It was a huge success. Thanks for a great and easy recipe Mike:)",
