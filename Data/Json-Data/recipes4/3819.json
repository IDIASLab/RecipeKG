I gave this out as part of my Christmas packages.  Everyone loved it and I'm now going to make more for New Year's.  Thanks!",

It is a little heavy on the Worcestershire sauce in my opinion so I think next time I might cut that in half. Here is a tip. I had the butcher at the market slice the meat from a roast. Made it super easy for me to throw it in a bag and marinate it over night. I did take a couple of the strips of meat and added red pepper flakes to them for a little zip- they were tasty.",
