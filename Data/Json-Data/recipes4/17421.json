After I coated them they went straight into the pan. I had 4 large fillets to cook so I fried 2 at a time in 4 T oil.  Didn't add the water as they already had enough moisture to cook. I completely forgot I had cornmeal until I found this recipe and went searching for it.  Did you know you can use expired cornmeal from FY 2012 as long as it has not been opened? Super simple way to pan fry Swai.  Thank you for posting this recipe!",

I live in Texas and I'm still WEEKS away from being able to use the oven without jacking up the temperature in the whole house! I thought I'd grill the fillets but hubby-kins forgot to tell me we're out of charcoal. I in \"swai\" here at allrecipes and found this great alternative! I used the crushed red pepper flakes with some pre-packaged fish coating mix (zataran's?) I had on hand. Wow!! Great taste and very very easy to fry up.. 5 minutes or so on each side for a lovely browned crunchy fillet. I omitted the last step (add water cover cook) because the fillets were perfect without it. Thanks for sharing this dish!!",
