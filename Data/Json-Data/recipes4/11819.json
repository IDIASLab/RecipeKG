Not to argue too much with PickyCook (and I do appreciate the feedback) but you REALLY have to watch the mayonnaise. 2 teaspoons is really the absolute most you should put in it. A dab is better. Also something else I've noticed - make SURE you use a good quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Since that's the only flavoring you'll notice the quality. And lastly - it's good to make a day or two in advance. The flavors get more depth as the salad \"ages\". I made a batch the night before for a cookout and it was good but then I ate some left overs the day after the cookout and it was just a lot better. Anyway I think I may add bacon next time. I hope other people try this and offer feedback.",
