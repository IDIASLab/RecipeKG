In deference to Hubs' sensitive innards I replaced half the jalapeno with minced green pepper and also cut back a bit on the cilantro, since he's of the camp whose taste buds believe it tastes like soap.  Flavorful, but in a supportive way.  It doesn't \"step on the toes\" of the main dish, in this case, \"Bacon Wrapped Barbecue Shrimp,\" recipe also from this site.  I can see this as being a conveniently versatile rice dish too, the ideal complement to ANY meat or seafood entree simply by eliminating the cilantro and jalapeno if it doesn't fit.  As written, however, it's delightful.",

Allowed the rice to fry in the oil/onions/jalapeno mixture for a minute or two before adding wine & broth/water (didn't bother to measure salt & pepper). It seemed like the ratio of rice/green ingredients was off (1 bunch of green onions = 1/4lb) but it wasn't! We really liked this none of the flavors overpowered the other & it was just nice & fresh tasting. The jalapeno & cilantro doesn't mean it needs to be served alongside an ethnic dish - it's that neutral. Also for those afraid of the jalapeno I scraped as much seeds & pith as I could so I was just left with the flavor of the pepper & none of the heat. Half the recipe easily served 6. Thanks Kimber I'm really glad I tried this!",

In its' place I used a whole green bell pepper. The prep and cook time was approximate. This turned out much better since everyone enjoyed this side dish. It is a pretty dish as well with the minced green flecks of bell pepper and herbs throughout the rice. The rice is tasty and flavorful with nothing overpowering each other (bell pepper parsley onions cilantro). I thought I would be able to taste the cilantro since it is a stronger herb however I liked it in this dish. This is a nice change to plain white rice that we normally eat.
