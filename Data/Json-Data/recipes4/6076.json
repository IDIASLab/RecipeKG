I've used many combinations of fillings including, sausage, bacon, hot sausage, peppers (sweet, hot, jalepeno) mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus tips, onions (really whatever I have on hand). I mix up the cheese depending on the filling and what I have in the fridge (cheddar, swiss, gruyere, parmesan, feta, pepper jack, you name it) I also add hot sauce, spices, herbs (whatever makes sense with the other ingredients). \n\nMy Tip:  If using vegetables that are frozen or watery by nature cook them first to get all the water out so they don't seep into the eggs. The veggies won't cook during the baking process!  \n\nI use my LARGE Wilton cupcake pans and for 8 eggs I get 6 \"muffin size\" eggs cups.  (about half cup of egg to each) One makes a nice meal. I usually make them up on a Sunday, cool, freeze and have them handy all week!\n\nTo make this REALLY easy - use the eggs that come in a carton (egg whites) - cuts some calories and gives the same result as whole fresh eggs.",
