I had no bacon or ham (although both would be great in this recipe) so I used 1 tablespoon butter. No bell peppers, so I added an anaheim pepper, also from the market. Instead of garlic powder I used a fat garlic clove. And I didn't crush the bay leaf but put it in whole & removed it when ready to serve. Great recipe and great seasonings. Thanks GLOKEY--it was just what I needed!",

I bought all the ingredients and it was a tremendous let down. Anybody familiar with crowder peas - I would love a good substitue. I read you could use blackeyed peas but the flavor was much milder - which is kind of a letdown. I so want this to be authentic. Any ideas from any of you would be appreciated??",

The peas have a delicate flavor and should not be seasoned with anything other than a moderate amount of salt and some seasoning meat (smoked ham hocks, dry salt meat, etc.).  Cover shelled peas with lightly salted water with the meat.  Bring water to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer (covered) for one hour.  Remove lid and continue to simmer for 30 min. (this is important to get the rich dark broth that is so important)  Serve with cornbread and cold milk with fried green tomatoes or fried potato/onion patties.  Nothing better!",
