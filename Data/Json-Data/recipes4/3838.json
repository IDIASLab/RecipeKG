I don't think the liquid smoke helps either. Cooking the asparagus like this in the micro only made it tough and almost burned it. Steaming it stovetop or in the micro with water would be a lot better. A few bacon sprinkles could take the place of liquid smoke if you really wanted it to have that flavor.",
