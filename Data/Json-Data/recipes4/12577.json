I used grond beef instead of the chorizo sausage added a can of corn. Instead of using four poblano's I used two poplano's and two green bell peppers. This was a big hit and EVERYONE said \"Mom!!! Make this again!!!\" It is delicious with or with out cheddar cheese on top. (This review is based on 8 servings)",

First I couldn't find pablano peppers so I used pasilla peppers (are they the same? idk) in addition I had a red bell pepper that needed using so I blackened that on up too. I used whole grain pasta that was 13 oz. so I just used it all. To compensate for the extra pasta I added a can of rotel and a can of undrained sweet corn (more veggies and color!!!). I skipped the added salt because my chorizo was plenty salty to do the trick. Since the recipe does not state when to add the chorizo again I did it at the very end when the pasta was done. Topped it off with a small pinch of Mexican cheese blend and a small dollop of light sour cream. Pretty healthy if you make sure to drain that chorizo! Tasty too! My 8 year old came up to me and was like \"Mom that dinner was...\" didn't say anything more but puffed up his cheeks motioned with his hands like his head was blowing up and made an exploding noise.... I said \"What was that? You mean mind blowing?\" He said....\"Oooohhhh Yeah!\" LOL! Silly boy!",
