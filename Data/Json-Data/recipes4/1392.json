Chopped up the stems and cooked in a little olive oil with the garlic. Added some chopped parsley to this. Substituted 1 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs for the croutons and used only 2 T of butter (versus the 1/2 cup of butter). Added the cheese then spooned into the mushroom caps. Sprayed the pan with cooking spray instead of brushing with the butter and baked as directed. Less than half the calories but still DIVINE!!! Next time will add the crab and lobster meat for sure.",

I then decided that tho they seemed a little dry that with tons of cheese and butter there was no way they could be. They were not dry they were great. Everyone really liked them. I did not look over the review first but will in the future. I hope to try this recipe again soon but with the sauce one of the reviewers put over theirs. It sounds yummy!",
