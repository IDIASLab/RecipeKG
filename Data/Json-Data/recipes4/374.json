Also I use a deep 9\" glass pie plate and the Pillsbury refrigerator crust, not the preformed crusts, they aren't as good or as big.  Glad everyone is enjoying this!  ",

I used a regular Pyrex glass pie plate and the recipe amounts were right on target. No spillover whatsoever. Puffed up to a golden brown in 60 minutes. I covered the edges of the pie crust with foil and took the foil off during the last 5 - 10 min. of baking. It makes a nice presentation. Don't be tempted to add salt - I thought about it - you really won't need it. Next time I would add some pepper. Some people might prefer the onions to be sauteed before adding to the mixture. However I think it's fine to put them in raw - just make sure it's a very small dice. Thanks for this great recipe Pam!",

To make it more appealing to my four year old I left the green chilies out and added fresh snipped chives.  The taste was very mild, but we enjoyed it.  As with other reviewers I had more than enough batter for 2 pie shells.  We ate one for dinner and I froze the other for later.",

I omitted the green chilis and used green onions and added spinach and bacon. The base ingredients are perfect for a quiche. I will make this again. UPDATE 4/13/15 - I use the base ingredients of this recipe all the time for quiche. Most recently I made two batches and put them in 2 greased 8x8 pans and added cooked spicy sausage, green onions and mushrooms to one and kale, bacon, green onions green peppers to the other.  They turned out super fluffy and since I didn't use any pie crust they were also low carb!",
