Maybe I should have kept a lid on it, but it didn't say to do that. I will try that next time. My advise is to watch it closly, and make sure it's on a low simmer or you'll be using a brillo pad on the bottom of your pot. I really liked this dish, thanks",

The carrots add a nice touch of sweetness while not being over powering. The only problem I had with this was the dryness. I ended up adding approximately 2 cups more water by the time the sauce was done (I simmered it in my slow cooker for approximately 4 hours on low). I think this would benefit from a can of diced tomatoes with their juices so next time I'll try that addition.",
