I added mushrooms and bought a whole chicken already prepared from the market (3month old keeps me VERY busy lol) and all I had to do was shred it off the bone and throw in the pot. I really enjoyed the soup and def is worth making. A little on the sweet side for some reason I think I would throw in a little squeeze of fresh lemon just for a little zing. So all in all very good. Not 5 star good but def woth the 4 stars. My husband says the same thing. Happy Eating people!!!! xoxo",
