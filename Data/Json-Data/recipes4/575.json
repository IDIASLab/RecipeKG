I added a tbsp of sugar and a tsp of cinnamon to the cream cheese and mixed it until creamy with my electric mixer. Then I spread it on each piece of bread before I cut it. A bit of extra work but it tastes better to me. I also added a tsp of vanilla to the eggs. Next time I would add another apple and mix it in with the bread as well as on the top. Thanks I will make again!!",

I looked up a sub for half and half and it said I could use evaporated milk so I used a can of evaporated milk with half and half added to make 2 cups total.  I now see why some said it was like bread pudding. It is much lighter and fluffier using 1% and I won't make it with heavier milk again.  Original review: As per other suggestions I used only 3/4 package (6oz) of cream cheese spread on pepperidge farms cinnamon swirl bread (no raisin fans in our home), 1 can of apple pie filling sprinkled with cinnamon, only 6 eggs, two cups of milk and 1/4c. margarine. I covered well and then used three bags of beans (bags of water would work if closed well) on top to weigh it down and make sure the egg mixture was absorbed evenly. It cooked at 350 degrees for one hour, covered with foil first 30 minutes to keep it from drying out.  It came out perfect. Fluffy, not too moist and absolutely delicious.  Can't wait to have it again!!",
