You need to first bring the water 2 tsp butter and the seasonin gpacket if there is one in the box to a boil. Then you add the couscous stir and let sit covered for at least 5 minutes. Cheddar cheese tastes the best and if the tomatoes reduce to a thicker consistency you get a lot more flavor. My family loved it.",

Sauteed 1/2 of a finely-minced onion with tomatoes added 1/2 can of drained sliced black olives; used 2 oz goat cheese I had leftover and 2 slices cheddar cheese crumbled up. The tomatoes made it festive and the black olives and goat cheese were very nice together. Will make again next time using finely chopped zucchini & yellow squash with the tomatoes for color. Thanks for the post it was very easy to make with only 15 mins til the main course was ready!",
