I then mix and put in a baking dish and bake for about 45 minutes at 375.",

We sopped up the sauce with our potatoes and broccoli.

Would definitely make it again",

I have been in the mood for pork chops lately and we had some nice Vermont maple syrup in the fridge so I tried out this recipe. After reading the comments about the lack of flavor I decided to kick up the flavor of the marinade by browning the onions in the hot pan after the pork was seared adding a few shakes of red pepper paprika and subbing out the white vinegar with apple cider vinegar. In order to make it a full meal I cut about seven carrots up into slices made sure they got coated with marinade and baked them right along with the chops in the casserole dish. The 45 minutes made everything tender juicy and super flavorful! I might leave off the red pepper next time although it was a nice kick of spice just to taste the maple but I'll definitely be making this again! Great suggestion.",

I made the sauce as stated and I added seasoned salt and black pepper to the pork chops before browning them in the skillet. Since my pork chops were only about a 1/2 inch thick instead of an inch thick they were ready after baking only about 20 minutes. I recommend using a casserole dish just large enough for the pork chops so the sauce will cover the pork chops. If the pan is too large the sauce will spread out too thin and not cover the pork chops. We will definitely be making this recipe again. Thanks for sharing.",

I decided to use cider vinegar because it sounded tastier but accidentally put in 1/4 c instead of a tablespoon; I added a little more maple to compensate and we liked it anyway. I sliced two potatoes thinly and put them with some baby carrots and the sauce in the pan in the oven while it preheated and I seared the pork chops then nestled the chops into the bed of vegetables and baked it covered with foil. I added a little more water to the sauce so the vegetables would cook well. The vegetables came out delicious soaking up the sauce.",

I used a pork tenderloin instead of chops (.75 lb) that I seared on all sides before nestling into a bed of sliced carrots and sweet potatoes. I also caramelized the onions in the pan at the same time as searing the pork. Then I doused everything with the sauce (I used cider vinegar and added a couple squirts of stone ground mustard). I cooked the pork for 45-50 minutes turning the pork once about 1/2 way through and taking it out 2-3 times to ladle the sauce over the top of the meat and veggies. I covered the dish with foil to help keep things moist and cook faster. If I were to do this again I'd start the veggies 10 mins earlier so they'd be a bit softer by the time the pork finished. Serve with crispy white bread to sop of the juices! (I used enough pork for 2 servings but kept the sauce volume the same)",
