I made some slight adjustments but otherwise stayed true to the recipe and enjoyed the combination of ingredients that made this savory and sweet salad. I used a rice blend instead of all brown and used 1/2 cup diced carrots and 1/2 cup of diced celery and omitted the peas. I also diced the red pepper and used 1/2 cup. I used white balsamic vinegar and loved the mild and pleasant sweet flavor combined with the tang of the Dijon mustard. The feta cheese was the crown jewel tying it all together. I liked it best after it was chilled. I will make this again without a doubt. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*)",

I really liked the suggestion from one of the reviewers which was to add finely chopped carrots and celery. It added a nice freshness and crunch. I don't care for raisins so I used dried cranberries and used red onion instead of white. Basically you can make many variations depending on your taste. (I don't care for peas and peppers.). I recommend adding the dressing and the raisins/dried cranberries to the rice while it's still hot, it absorbs the flavor a lot better and the raisins/cranberries plump up a little from the heat. I refrigerated the rice for a little while before I added the vegetables because I like them to stay crunchy.",

Having read other reviews I too omitted the peas cut back on the oil by half and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. However unlike everyone who substituted raisins for craisins I kept the raisins and thought their sweetness balanced out the tartness of the balsamic. I decided to sautee the onions red peppers and raisins to soften them up a bit and blend the flavors. My rice didn't turn a dark brown as described by another reviewer; maybe cause I tossed the rice with the sauteed veggies first which coated the rice in some oil. I will definitely be making this recipe again.",
