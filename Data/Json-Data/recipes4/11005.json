First, I used a large can of chicken broth (48 oz)and then added water to make the 6 cups of liquid. The chicken broth gave it a lovely flavor. Also, I added carrots and celery with the chicken and    just simmered all of it for appox. 30 minutes. (instead of taking the chicken out, cutting it up and putting it back in to cook more). Lastly, I used 1/4 cup cornstarch mixed with a little water to thicken the broth, instead of the flour. It blends in so much easier! This recipe is so good and easy, I will be making it many times this winter. My husband and sons LOVED it. Thank you!",

I used 3 chicken breasts with ribs instead of breasts, and boiled them with an onion wedge, rib of celery, 2 cups chopped carrots, and 1 tsp. salt for 30 minutes, then removed the onion and celery.  Because the chicken is already cooked, I skipped step 2.  I next added 4 more cups water (and another tsp. salt) because it seemed like too much chicken for the amount of broth (would do that again!).  For the thickening, I used 1/3 cup flour and 1/2 cup milk (milk instead of water - makes it more creamy).  I also added 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning, and 1/4 tsp. pepper, as others suggested.  I cooked the dumplings for 25 minutes total (lid off, so that it thickened); otherwise, they weren't done enough.  I also threw in a cup of frozen peas, about 5 minutes before serving.  Nice addition of color (and veggies).  Great comfort food!  Thanks for the recipe!",

HOLY GOSH was it TERRIFIC!! As others, I did make some substitution: instead of water, I used 1 box of low sodium Chicken Broth, and half a box of chicken stock. I added to the broth 1 clove of chopped garlic, some celery, carrots, and a bit of onion powder (didn't have an onion) in addition to the salt and pepper. Then I added one can of the healthy cream of chicken soup before kicking it up to a boil to add the dumplings. After the dumplings were in, I mixed about 1 Tbsp. of cornstarch with some broth and added it to thicken. \nSo wonderful and I highly recommend (even in the heat of the summer! just turn up your A/C and enjoy!)",
