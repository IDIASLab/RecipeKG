I made the sause: used 6 tble. lite mayo 2 teas. of wasabi 1 tble. soya I didn't use any other spice mixed all well reserve in small bowl. I marinated the filets in 1 tble. soya and 1 tble. rice vinegar both sides brushed mayo mixture on top flipped over and brushed mayo on other side covered and refrigerated for 30 min. No longer. Toasted seasame seeds 8 tble. set aside on a small plate. To cook fish I heated no-stick pan sprayed with baking spray on medium meat. Place fish filet one at a time on seasames to coat brushed with the mayo on other side and coated that side. Then into the pan. We like tuna med. rare so I cooked for 2 min. per side for fish that was 1 1/2 inches thick. When fish is done put on serving plate. In same pan I added leftover mayo mixture there is lots as I just brushed on to marinate (both sides) before marinating. I quickly heated reserved up and spread 1 tble. of this to top side of cooked tuna and served immediately. The sesame seeds browned beautifly and stayed on fish. I would also like to try this using a good quality balsamic vinegar instead of the rice vinegar.",

I bought a bag of individual servings of frozen Mahi Mahi at Costco hoping to find a recipe like this in allrecipes. It's not exactly like Cheesecakes, but close enough. Yum yum yum! My husband and daughter kept telling me how good it tasted. I didn't add the five spice, and since I love wasabi added extra. That's something that can easily be played around with. I also doubled the first ingredients so I would have enough to re-apply before I was ready to cook. After re-applying one side I then coated with panko crumbs and did the same on the other side. Oh so good! Thanks for sharing Jennifer!",

I will say that the flavor was most overwhelmingly form the Chinese 5 Spice Powder I didn't taste the wasabi at all really. But the taste ended up being very authentic similar to dishes I've had in China. And it is super easy! I would make it again exactly like I did before.",

I served it with a macaroni pasta with peas shredded carrots and scallions just tossed on little olive oil it made the flavored balanced well and avoid concentrate on the saltiness of the fish (soy sauce).
