When I realized it was going to need more liquid to get the noodles done I used a mixture of the tomato puree and chicken broth instead of water. That definitely added to the flavor and I would replace all of the water with it next time. Watch your noodles closely. They do not make any sizzling noises so if you turn your back on them like I did you will end up with some very brown noodles around the edge of the skillet. Overall I think this was a good recipe but one that just needs a little extra than what it calls for.",

I took the suggestion of the previous reviewer and used more tomato puree instead of water also additional broth (to cook the noodles) and some oregano. I started by saut\u00e9ing onion and celery after the noodles just to give it a little texture. I have made Sopa de Fideo before in various ways and find it to be tasty and filling. This is a good base recipe and I may try a little chicken or sausage next time but I will keep it and play around with the ingredients for fun.",
