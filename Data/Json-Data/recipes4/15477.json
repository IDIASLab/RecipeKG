This recipe only needs changes based off of personal preference, this is why it is five star.  I prefer to chop up the fresh basil and mix it into the couscous before stuffing the tomato.  We love basil, so the more per bite the better.  Also, I mix the tomato that was removed into the  couscous, I hate the thought of wasting it.  Last, like others I add cheese on top then throw it back in to melt the cheese.  Amazing on its own or paired with some grilled chicken.",

I did add butter and salt to the couscous just for more flavor and after I stuffed the tomatoes I covered and put it back in the oven for about 20 minutes to melt the cheese. I'll definitely make this again and can't wait for grilling time! Thanks for the recipe C Murphy!!",
