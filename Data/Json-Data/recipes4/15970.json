I also had to use crushed crackers for the top since that was what I had around. The soy sauce really enhances the flavor, I would suggest to those who thought it bland to add a dash more of that and see if it pops. Thanks for the recipe!",

I made it exactly but didn't have an onion. I'm also confused by the butter to breadcrumps ratio because I used 4 T of butter and it didn't come close to blending with all the bread crumbs therefore leaving a dry layer on top of casserole after baking which I just basically scooped off. Maybe I was supposed to use real bread instead of the canned bread crumbs??",
