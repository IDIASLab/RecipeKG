If there are no mustard greens it is not \"saag\". This could be a \"palak\" dish (palak means spinach). Also no South Asian person (myself included) would ever add milk and/or cottage cheese to such a dish. Cubes of paneer can be added. But as this recipe stands it is entirely inaccurate to call it a saag dish or even any version of a saag dish. This seems be more of an \"Indianized\" creamed spinach dish.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a response to the review by MGPaneer on Jan25 2011(I have not tried this recipe). Saag is NOT name of Mustard Greens in either Hindi or Punjabi. That honor belongs to Sarson. Saag is the name of a dish that is cooked in such a fashion with leafy greens. So if the primary leafy green is Mustard Greens(which is usually the case) then it is called Sarson da Saag (da=of so this translated to Saag of Mustard Greens). This dish could be called Kale da Saag. As for the addition of milk/cream this is a common practice in many Indian restaurants in both India and the US to give the Saag added richness. Home cooks tend to use a big chunk of butter/ghee instead of the milk to give it the richness. So the person is correct in calling this Saag although calling it Kale Saag may be more appropriate since just Saag is usually always with Sarson(Mustard Green). Also Paneer is a type of Cottage Cheese so please go over your info before posting. Just because you Indian does not make you correct(I am Indian btw) Hope this helps.",

I accidentally over blended half of the saag for the last step so it came out looking like babyfood- but such a beautiful color! The only thing I changed was to use olive oil instead of ghee- didn't have any and was too lazy to make some from scratch. I don't know if I'd make this again. It wasn't bad. It helped me use up all the kale I had which was why I thought to make it in the first place but it's really too high in carbs for my husband and I to eat and it didn't particularly wow either of us.",

                "reviewBody": "The contrary opinions on whether this can be called saag and the appropriateness of the ingredients arise from different sub-cultures within the Indian sub-continent. Among Punjabis( people whose ancestors and possibly they themselves are from the Punjab region) the term \"saag\" means a simple curry made from bitter mustard greens and milder greens such as spinach. No milk cream etc is EVER added- that would be blasphemous. For non-Punjabis however \"saag\" means any dish made of leafy green vegetables such as this one. It is common to add cream milk paneer etc to green leafy vegetables. So everyone who posted their ire is correct according to their perspective! For more trivia linguistically \"saag\" is related to \"shaak\" which means vegetable. That is why a vegetarian is called \"shakahari\"- one that eats vegetables.",
