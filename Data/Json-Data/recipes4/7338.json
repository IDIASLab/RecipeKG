I did half the recipe for just the two of us. I pretty much followed the recipe except did put some ground pepper and a bit of Old Bay along with the salt on the fish. The cooking instructions were a bit confusing so we cooked at 350 over indirect heat for 15 minutes and then turned the pan for ten more minutes. The fish and vegetables were perfectly done in the 25 minutes. Simmering in the medley of vegetables gave such a wonderful flavor to the Tilapia. My husband took one bite and said \"this is amazing\". This was also pretty simple to put together served over Ann's rice pilaf on AR. We will make this one again. Perfect summer grilling recipe. Update: We have made this many times now using our cast iron skillet with foil covering a favorite when were camping. Works with other fish also.",

I made half a recipe lightly seasoned the tilapia loins with a bit of salt pepper and a sprinkle of garlic (along with the lime juice) then added the mixture of bell peppers onions tomatoes jalapeno and cilantro (which I didn't measure just used about 1/3rd of a small bunch) fishing off with the rest of the lime. It was pouring outside so I baked in the oven figuring 350 was about medium heat on the grill. WRONG! After 20 minutes the vegetables were still very crunchy and not even warm. Turned the heat up to 400 and cooked for another 20 minutes which wasn't quite long enough to cook the fish throughout. But another 5 minutes and the fish was done but the bell peppers were still kind of crunchy. Next time I'll very thinly slice the bell peppers so they cook faster and plan on cooking at least 30 minutes at 400 before checking. Now tilapia loins are thicker than fresh tilapia so perhaps that explains the cooking time difference. We did enjoy it though and will have again perhaps with fresno peppers for a slightly different taste. Thanks for sharing.",
