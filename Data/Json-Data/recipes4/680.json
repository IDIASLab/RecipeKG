I took another reviewer's suggestion and dipped them in a good quality milk chocolate. This was my first time tempering chocolate. The directions are on this site - Melting and Tempering Chocolate. It couldn't be easier and the results were very professional. If you love French chocolate mints this is the recipe for you. Will definately make again and again! Thanks for posting this recipe!",

Next time I'll cut one row then dip in chocolate then cut some more and dip etc. I cut them all at once. The last mints that I dipped in chocolate dried just a bit on the sides (Denver is dry...) I recommend pure belgian chocolate for dipping making the finished product look very smooth and professional. I put each one in it's own little mini paper cup just like the candy factory does. The family LOVED them!!! I was asked \"You made these?!?!!!?\" more than once. Thanks for the recipe!:-)",

These really are amazing...better than any fudge ever.  They are so creamy and smooth, and the mint is not overpowering at all.  We all love them.  When it comes time to leave them in the fridge and hand-beat every few minutes, leave the blade from your mixer in the bowl - it's so much easier to use than trying to do it with a wooden spoon! I highly recommend this recipe -- easy and fantastic.",

For the Holidays you can melt white chocolate with red food coloring and green and drizzle over it. After they cooled I melted more chocolate and spooned over them nicely.
