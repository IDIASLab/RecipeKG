I was worried that the recipe called for too much garlic and dill but I decided to try it anyways BOY am I glad I did!!! These burgers were exactly what they are called Garlic Dill Burgers. They were definitely garlic but my family LOVES garlic! Adjust garlic to your family's preference but don't reduce the dill it really makes the burger. The only change I made was I omitted the dill pickles because I didn't have any.. but these were Fantastic without! I will definitely make these again - Thanks Martin Mania!!!",

I thought 11/4 lbs of meat was an odd amount. I had a 1 lb package of extra lean beef. I used all the ingredients suggested and for the mustard I used dijon. The reduced seasonings were the dill and garlic powder using 1 teaspoon of the garlic powder and 1 tablespoon of the dry dried dill. I did add an additional tablespoon of chopped pickles though. It was evening so I put them in the broiler on high on a sprayed foil lined sheet. The pickles had the burgers in lots of liquid. So when I flipped them I moved them to a clean baking sheet. When done I used a toasted wheat bun and basic condiments mayo dijon and ketchup. The pickles and dill flavored them plenty. I got 6 burgers.",
