I even added a ton of extra garlic as well as crushed red pepper but it was still bland. I served it with couscous as others suggested and I don't think it worked well because everything in the dish is a bit squishy so the couscous becomes unnoticeable. I think rice would go much better--it's a bit more substantial. Unless chickpeas were substituted for the cannelini beans--then couscous might be ok with it. I served the leftovers the next day over brown rice (would also work well with whole grain macaroni) & topped off with some ground vegetarian \"sausage\" (Morningstar Farms brand--tastes just like the real thing!!).",
