I used the recipe for cooking bacon in the oven from this site, bacon for a crowd which I must say I think is wonderful, make sure you use a pan with sides for the drippings, or check out the reviews for some great tips.  Though I do use the thick bacon I think this could do well with thin bacon if the heat is cut back and watched carefully.  I also have used parchment paper and overlap the bacon so it curls less.  Add parchment or foil to the top so it don't splatter.   Heated olive oil in a skillet and browned both sides of chicken then put in oven to finish.  So yummy.  Thanks so much for the post.",

Stuffing the chicken with muenster and bacon was enough for me. It was also quite spicy. Not bad spicy but relatively spicy so I'd probably either not use the hot sauce with the egg or not use the cajun seasoning with the bread crumbs. I made my own cajun seasoning with the Simple Cajun Seasoning recipe from this site. I used turkey bacon and I didn't like cooking the chicken in the same pan as the bacon. The pan was a burned mess (maybe bc I used turkey bacon?) before I transferred to a baking dish (I have a skillet that can be put in the oven but I misread the directions). I'd cook the bacon separately next time. I also think the breading and egg could have been used for 4 chicken breasts not 3. Overall I liked it and with less cheese and spice would be excellent. Thanks for the recipe!",

This is a heart attack waiting to happen and I had to pull all of the stuffing out to even eat the chicken. I seriously feel the need to guzzle a gallon of water as I type this. My face is puckering from all of the salt I just consumed. However the basics are good and this could be a nice dish if tweaked. The salt is completely uncessary due to the salt in the massive amount of bacon called for. The creole seasoning is also 90% salt. I will make this again with the following changes. Completely omit all salt use 1/2 of the bacon and use smoked gouda instead of whatever cheese is called for in this receipe. I will also cut the creole seasoning into at LEAST half. As far as the bread crumbs use Panko. MUCH better. I'm now going to drink a gallon of water and try to recover from my salt attack meal.",

However it does have a kick-I think I'd leave the hot sauce out next time just because I don't feel it really complimented the rest of the flavors. I used 1 1/2 tsp of garlic salt in place of the salt & garlic powder. The muenster completley melted out of the chicken so it was kind of a waste but I disagree that it was cheese overkill. Since the muenster melted we were left w/just the provolone & it needed more cheese imo. I was hoping for a really rich cheesy chicken breast & it wasn't. It WAS very good tho! Thank you!",
