I did take the advice of several earlier postings and substituted frozen shrimp and cajun seasoning rather than the canned shrimp and regular salt. I also made one other substitution - I used pasta rather than rice. I realize that this is a rather large change but the 8 ounces of penne pasta made for a wonderful pasta salad. I can assure you that I will be making this again in the future. Thanks again.",
