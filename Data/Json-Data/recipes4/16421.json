I agree, and I think the flavors blended better this way. I may never roll cabbage again.",

I've made it with ground turkey or chicken. I've omitted ground meats and added kielbasa and have also made it with sweet sausage.  Always add garlic. Added rice or chopped or slice potato. Normally add a teaspoon or 2 of sugar.  This is a great basic recipe play with the ingredients and spices.  No matter what you add or not it's always satisfying. Kraft recipes also has a version of it also.  Thanks for sharing.",

Instead, take a can of tomato paste and add water to your liking to taste.  Tomato paste is tangy and can be regulated with your personal salt content. Campbell's soup is salt in a can.  I bought two cans of tomato paste in case I needed a tomato flavor. It's cheap, and does not taste like soup, you are putting into, well, soup.  I surfed the web and found a lot of people use brown sugar, vinegar, or lemon in the recipe.  The vinegar and lemon would be used to cut the cabbage bitterness... and sugar... to mimic American-Italian sauces?  They contain a lot of sugar, by the way.  I did add a splash or two of Worcestershire sauce.  BUT THAT'S IT.  Turned out awesome.  I freezed half of it for later. Everyone loved it.",
