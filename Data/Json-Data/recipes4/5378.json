I LOVED these; however, I used them as a vegetable side dish, not as an appetizer.  I altered the recipe only slightly \u2013 the uncooked spinach is so bulky I knew it would be a problem filling the mushrooms caps, but microwaving it briefly until it was slightly wilted took care of that issue handily.  Since I was serving this as a side dish I was tempted to omit the pepperoni and I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t \u2013 the flavor it contributed was distinct, delicious and would have been missed.  These were meaty, substantive and flavorful, not to mention an attractive and inviting statement on the dinner plate.",

And I even messed those up by overcooking the noodles to be absolutely sure they were done.\n\nI am getting married in a month and I somehow agreed to cook dinner for my fiancee for Valentine's day. I was so worried about what I would cook. I joked that it would be fish sticks marinated in Spaghettios, but I was really nervous about making something edible.\n\nI found several recipes here and decided to go with this one. I didn't really know what I was doing, but I bought each item and set down in the kitchen to get to work. The recipe is straightforward, simple, easy enough for a novice and incredibly delicious. She was so proud of me and so impressed and it was a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner. I'm attaching a picture (but it was taken after she had already cut the portobello in half).\n\nThank you so much to whoever created this and thank you allrecipes.com for making it so accesible. I can't believe I made something actually edible by humans, and in fact deliciously so! You made Valentine's Day awesome for us!",

Also when draining the mushrooms after the first baking round, know that they're extremely full of juice and are fragile from being cooked. I'd recommend a turkey baster to remove the juices and not break the mushroom edges trying to pour it out. Otherwise fantastic recipe!",

I sauteed chopped onion and red bell pepper in a little olive oil until softened and translucent, then tossed the raw spinach on top to wilt it down a bit.
