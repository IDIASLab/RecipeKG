Now I typically like my cheesesteaks \"Whiz Wit\" so that's how I made this sandwich. I used a whole onion and good ol' Cheez Whiz. I probably could have went a little heavier on the Whiz but it was fine. I also used a can of mushrooms instead of fresh. 25 mins cooking time would have burnt my tasty sammy because when I checked in at 21 mins it was just at the point of dark where if I would have let it go a bit more it wouldn't have been a good thing. Next time I think I'll take it out around 19 or 20 mins but that may just depend on the brand/type of dough - this time I used store brand. Either way keep an eye on that. I will most definitely make this again. Everyone in this house dove into it. I should have made 2!",
