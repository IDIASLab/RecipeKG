I knew they all (including my husband) loved the \"baked potato salad\" from the Fresh Market around the corner from us but I am back on low-carb and needed something that would be similar for me (as I love the baked tater salad too but obviously couldn't eat it...) and...This was AWESOME! I used full-fat sour cream and full-fat mayo as I am low-carb and low-carbers eat FAT (because it's good for you!) No this is not low-calorie as low-carb does not usually (ever) mean low-calorie...it was WONDERFUL! I bought a block of white cheddar and shredded it instead of using pre-shredded cheese. The friends who invited us over USUALLY make fun of my \"low-carb creations\"... and they ate it up! note - if you want this to be low-er fat go ahead and use fat free mayo (or low-fat ff is gross in my opinion but to each their own)...and the same with the sour cream. Otherwise go for the full fat as this was amazing! And I will be making it again and again!",

It's made with fat-free sour cream and reduced fat mayo after all. Then I looked at the proportions. Even a half a cup of low fat mayo is a lot. And one whole cup of full fat cheese adds on the fat. So I reduced the sour cream and mayo to a total of one half cup and I didn't even use all of it. I cut the olive oil to one tablespoon and used only 1/4 cup of Parmesan instead of a full cup of cheddar. This was delicious and we enjoyed it very much. Thanks so much for the post Sarah Jo!",
