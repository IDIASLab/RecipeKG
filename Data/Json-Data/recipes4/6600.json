We enjoy poppers made on the grill so the boys chose to grill the peppers for a few minutes to give them that cooked and roasted flavor. Once cooled they removed the skins and seeds and chopped 'em up. We followed the recipe exactly other than that step. Everyone's first remark was \"Wow\" followed by \"This is great (delicious awesome fantastic ) and some other comments that were garbled by mouths being full.:) One of the other boys commented that he was glad we planted Jalapenos in the garden because we're gonna need 'em to make more of this dip. Our peppers were very hot - possibly more so because of the grilling- but it was perfect for our taste. Just wonderful. Thanks Cat for sharing your recipe! Update It was requested I make this for an afternoon by the pool. I had a container (8 oz) of sour cream that needed using up so I added it to the ingredients. The result was a creamier dip and easier to scoop without breaking the chips. I plan on making part of the ingredients as it was enjoyed so much.",

The bacon and onions and garlic only add to this super delicious dip. I already know I'll be making this again and again.

Cat-Hill your recipe is absolutely wonderful and so much easier to make than stuffed poppers. I made a half batch to take in to school. Five of us wasted no time polishing off the dip and all four of them wanted the recipe. I let the mini-chopper take care of jalape\u00f1os for me. It did a great job and I didn t have to worry about the oils from the peppers. I baked for 30 minutes in the toaster oven and then reheated it in the microwave when we enjoyed it with our lunch. I added fresh diced tomatoes on top before serving with tortilla chips. Thanks for sharing a winner Cat-Hill.",

I brought tortilla chips to dip but one party-goer even slathered it on his hot dog as a topping. He said it was delicious that way. Just a couple cooking notes: It took me a bit longer to bake it (maybe closer to 30 minutes) and using my stand mixer was a life-saver. It's really really thick.",
