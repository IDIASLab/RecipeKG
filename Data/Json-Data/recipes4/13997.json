I also added stewed tomatoes to the black eyed pea mixture as it appeared a bit dry for stuffing and baked the peppers in tomato juice as I like a saucy stuffed pepper. I didn't garnish it with cheese but my husband thought it needed it...something his Mom did I suppose. Thank you MOTTSBELA for sharing your recipe!

I had a meat eater say \"if I could eat stuff like this every day it would be easy to be a vegeatarian\". Only thing with this recipe is it took way longer to roast the red peppers...closer to 40 minutes. I added mushrooms and used extra swiss chard (rainbow chard actually) like some of the other users. The mushrooms were good for a meaty texture. I cooked the rice with diced tomatoes/broth along with the water. I used chick peas instead of black eyed peas because that's what I had. I think the others would be better but it was still delish. I also added a cheese alternative to the mix to keep it sticky. A few dashes of cumin and drizze of agave nectar in the mix rounded out the flavor nicely. The photo with the red peppers were mine. They tasted as good as they looked!",
