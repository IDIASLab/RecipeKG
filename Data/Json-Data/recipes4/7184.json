I sauteed a small chopped green bell pepper with the onion and garlic.  Also I did not use sofrito...basically the onions, green pepper, and garlic are already sofrito so that's kind of redundant.

Followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of adding a good splash of red wine and using halved olives WITH  pimientos.   We enjoyed this stew with yellow rice and black beans.",

The addition of olives really gave the stew a fantastic flavour.  (I understand that salt wouldn't have been used traditionally, but I like salt!). Thank you",
