I did not chop the chipotles because the recipe didn't say to and to compensate I added in about 1 Tbsp extra adobo sauce. I served it to my husband and son without the sour cream as they are sensitive to dairy and the rest of us ate it with the sour cream. To be honest it was a little rich for me I had a bite before adding the sour cream and preferred it that way. My children did not care for it (too spicy for them I think) but my husband loved it and at all of his serving and my son's. If/when I make this again I will omit the sour cream for all of us.
