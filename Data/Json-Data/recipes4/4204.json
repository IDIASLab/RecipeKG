The maple glaze was so delicious, I spooned some over the chops.  I didn't have maple syrup but had McCormick's Maple flavoring, so I made my own.   The recipe is on the box.  Since I only needed 1/4 cup of apple juice, I used a portion of a box of Juicy Juice.  The smell of it cooking as the juice and syrup were reducing was awesome.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you grandmary for sharing such a SUPER recipe.",
