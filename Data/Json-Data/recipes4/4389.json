Used fresh broccoli and instead of 2 cans of cream of ckn soup I used only 1 and used 1 can of cream of broccoli then the other can of cream of mush. Also used about 1/2 C. more Swiss cheese. This recipe is a winner. I really was questioning the Swiss cheese since most lasagnas that I know of use mozzarella. I went on faith and it turned out great. This recipeis a keeper!

And because I was using more chicken and broccoli I used 4 cans and about 2 1/2 cups of broth. I baked off my chicken in chicken broth with seasonings so I just used that. No need to waste anything! I shredded my chicken and put into the \"sauce\" put atleast 2 cups of that on the bottom if not more of the pan.The bottom noodles tend to burn when I use the no boil noodles.I was smart about it this time!:) Then I layed four noodles sauce placed broccoli then put down my shredded cheese.Did that for 3 layers.It turned out SO yummy! My husband ate TWO full plates. And it was a hit for the kiddos!(3&5)So it was great for the whole family!!:) Thanks for the yummy advice!",
