This recipe also goes great with a salad of mixed greens and vinaigrette.",

I live in a small town and couldn't find any goat cheese so I used plain havartti instead. Also I could only find prosciutto in 3\" x 7\" slices. So I used two slices per breast and wrapped them lengthwise overlapping the ends under the bottom. Thus there was no need for toothpicks. For the last 5 minutes of baking I turned the breasts back so the ends were on the bottom again and broiled for 4-5 minutes. I served this with oven baked red potatoes and Strawberry and Feta Salad from this site.",

I made this for a friends gathering and substituted the goat cheese with feta because I knew some guest were not a fan of goat cheese. The feta worked just as well. I did a light feta so that it did not over power the salty flavour of the prosciutto. Loved the combination of the herbs! I will definitely be making this again!",
