Seemed like the ingredients were a little unusual but it looked like something I could work with. I used 2 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes with garlic. I m still not sure where all the salt is coming from don t add any more. I used grown up Cremini s Portabella s that is homemade pesto dried basil and oregano and twice as much reduced fat Mozzarella. Also I prefer more like a third of my daily protein intake per meal (3 meals per day) so added less chicken than called for. No point wasting protein it is one of the more expensive aspects to required daily needs. I also added a can of healthy choice cream of mushroom soup for flavor and creaminess as well as some white wine during the reduction process. I didn t cook the tomato mixture as long as recommended and added the onion and shrooms early. The polenta was Original on the bottom and Garlic Basil for the upper layer. What I m saying is I m not one to respect a recipe on the first go round. It was a lot of work what with searing the polenta 2 patches in a big pan blah blah blah...but it was DARN good in the end and a change of pace from the whole grain/wheat pasta s that I LOVE.",

I tossed the chicken chunks in the pesto sauce instead of trying to smear it over the pieces of polenta and used canned tomato sauce for convenience. I couldn't find pre-made polenta so I made my own nothing is easier! Next time I'm going to try broiling the polenta in the oven instead of taking the time to fry all those pieces in several batches. I really liked the polenta in place of pasta it gives it such a good texture. Thanks for the recipe!",

I used canned no-salt added tomatoes as I had no good fresh ones and used fresh oregano/basil from the garden. I did simmer tomatoes with mushrooms herbs and onions to meld the flavors and reduce the liquid for about 40 minutes. I liked the addition of the pesto and as some previously suggested tossed the chicken in the pesto before adding to the lasagne. The combination of flavors is good with an overall lighter dish than traditional lasagne. Hubby loved it as it was easy on his GI. I will make again but will also try broiling the polenta to save a little time. Overall a really good and healthy recipe. Thanks for posting chickuh4you!",
