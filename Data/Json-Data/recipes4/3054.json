I couldn't find any jalapeno powder so I used a whole jalapeno minced fine. I don't know what it would be like if you added the jalapeno powder but just by adding the jalapeno it wasn't spicy at all. The flavor of the dish is really good but when I went to serve it there was a lot of runny liquid in the casserole. I think the next time I might leave out the cream and see if that helps. Also the meatballs are very salty there is a lot of salt in the adobo seasoning so the next time I will only use 1 Tbls of the seasoning. Instead of putting the meatballs on top of the dish I cut them in half and mixed them in with the macaroni and cheese. The sauce is really good. I will definitely make this again it's really good. UPDATE: the pasta must have absorbed the excess liquid because I ate the leftovers today and it wasn't too runny.",

I personally thought the recipe was 4 stars but this turned out to be the favorite dish of the night amongst everyone else. Definitely be patient and let all the cheese melt together before adding the pasta. The combination of the different cheeses was great (I actually used a 4 c of a mexican blend rather than 4 c of plain cheddar cheese). Tastes great reheated the next day as well.",

The second time I took my time and really let the cheese melt into the cream before mixing in the noodles and it was perfect. The adobo meatballs are a great touch and round out the dish. My adobo seasoning is salt-free (from Penzeys Spices not Goya) so the meatballs were a great compliment to the cheesiness (sp?) and not overly salty. Also a great idea to add coriander to the macaroni--it's the perfect substitute for nutmeg that I like to add to my regular macaroni. GREAT DISH!",

I did not however have any problems with it being runny just be patient and let the cheese melt and stir. It was the perfect consistency! I'd love to make the mac & cheese without the meatballs sometime because I thought it was a great mexican-type dish all by itself. I also supplied the photo.",
