There are regional variations throughout Wales as to what meat is used; some use Pork or Mutton we use Shin Beef. The quantities used here are based on my own requirements for two to three days, as this soup is one that improves on subsequent re-heating. Serve with lightly buttered bread and a good mature Cheddar cheese",

I love Parsnips in my cawl and my mother likes Brussel sprouts. And leftovers taste better and better each day it sits. As long as it has meat root veggies and Leeks it's called a Cawl!",
