However, this is missing two key ingredients:  butter and salt.  It took everything in me not to add them when I was prepping this, but decided to follow the recipe since I'd be the first \"real\" review.  I wish I'd added them...  I made this the night before and chose to forgo sauteing the veggies for a few reasons:  I'm lazy, we like veggies w/a bit of a crisp, and they cook just fine IN the casserole.  Other than that, I followed the recipe, though I did halve it for the two of us (and froze the remainder of the potatoes and cream of chicken soup together for another future half).  I took a small portion, and did not finish it.  It tastes strongly of cream of chicken soup, which is not a pleasant flavor (most of the other recipes I've made call for the soup, too, and I've never noticed it as prominently).  If you add 1/2C butter and 1 tsp of salt, this would be at least 4 stars.  THANKS for the recipe; I'm sorry it wasn't our cup o' tea.",
