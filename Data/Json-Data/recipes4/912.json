To cut some fat I used milk but in place of the cream I used fat  \nfree evaporated milk (same measurements) I used smart balance in the sauce and butter for the shrimp. In place of  just parm. I used a  pre-shredded blend in the deli section of parm. romano, and asiago. I love garlic so I added a little extra and went easy on the pepper and hot sauce because I was also serving this to my picky kids. This had a nice kick but wasn't too hot. I used fresh broccoli and pesto (I loved the flavor and I don't think just fresh basil would   have had the same affect)Lastly I made the sauce a few hrs. in advance and I think that may have been a good thing as I discovered the flavors had a chance to blend and tasted better after some time. ( another reviewer had mentioned it was good reheated)All in all I was a great hit and will be made again!",

I also at least doubled the garlic amounts as we love our garlic too.  I always double the sauce recipes on anything I make since we are all sauce eaters and don't like dry food, and I'm glad I did, it was just enough.  Boy, is this ever good and you can change out the shrimp or broccoli for other things very easily as well.  This is easy and great enough for entertaining.",

If you like a lot of sauce, you need to add more of the milk and heavy cream. My kids ate every bite!!!",
