I had some leftover ground turkey from another recipe so I threw that in the mix too. My store was out of eggroll wrappers so I was forced to use wonton wrappers and they worked good in this too. They were small and cute and would make for perfect finger foods for a Superbowl party. The recipe does not specify what to do with the tofu once it is drained so I added it in step 3. These are quite a bit of work but worth it in the end!",
