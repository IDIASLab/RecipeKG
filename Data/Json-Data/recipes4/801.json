I do however ALWAYS and ONLY make meat loaf using turkey.  I also only use wheat germ to hold it all together (instead of bread crumbs or crackers or something).  Just substitute same measuring.  Some may not like that texture, but my little family loves it and we usually eat the whole thing in one meal.  I also use one pound of turkey, and still one egg.  Just play around with it, you will figure it out.  Just keep in mind that it is REALLY good for you and can make it just as yummy as your other meat loaf.  I also have added lots of garlic or worchestersire sauce.",
