Made exactly as written but reduced the rosemary to 1/2 tsp. because I was using on 'Alfredo Lasagna Roll Ups' from here and I didn't want it to be too strong which ended up being just right for us. Also I had to use more cheese to get it to the consistancy that I wanted. This had excellent flavor! I will definately be using this recipe again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
