The proportions in the recipe are good but I go through the whole process of roasting and peeling green chile when I make it. I cook the onion along with the beef and drain. We like ours with more liquid so I always add beef broth. In addition the posted recipe didn't use garlic but it is a must have. Green chiles without garlic is like pizza without cheeze. It's a great base to tweak to your own liking. Also it's really inexpensive.",

I used 2 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes and 1 14 oz can of crushed tomatoes and 1 14 oz can of beef broth and omitted the water. I also increased the amount of chopped onions to 3/4 cup added 2 cloves of minced garlic and a TBSP of worcestershire sauce. I used a combination of chopped hot peppers and the stew is still only mildly spicy. We will try one more time with more revisions like using stew meat rather than ground beef and more peppers and onions and garlic. Hopefully this will be a keeper after our next try.",
