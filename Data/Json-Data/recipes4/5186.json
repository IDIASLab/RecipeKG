        "description": "Two of the most crucial ingredients used in New Orleans cooking are Cajun spice and local seafood! Crab has always been my favorite type of shellfish, but I have never really cared much for crab cakes. The overpowering presence of seasoned breadcrumbs used in most recipes interferes with the sweet and delicate flavors of the fresh lump crabmeat. After years of experimenting with many of New Orleans' most famous crab cake recipes, I have created a flavorful, mouth-watering, delicious piece of work! The key is to use a small amount of crumbled crackers instead of breadcrumbs. I hope you enjoy!",

His sensitive innards would never be able to tolerate all that Sriracha in the sauce I thought. But he said he wasn t interested in having any crab cakes anyway so I proceeded. But he tried them and ended up eating two of them we were both surprised at how much we liked them! So different so flavorful spicy and fresh tasting!

                "reviewBody": "I have made this recipe twice: the first time without dipping sauce and I used some fresh parsley I had around and made my own cajun seasoning. It was very good (4.5 stars). The second time I made it according to directions (2.5 stars-- maybe I misread them): dried parsley flakes do not hack it for me; Tony Cachere's seasoning has way too much salt; and I have to believe that there is a typo on the dipping sauce: we could not eat it way too salty. IMHO make it with fresh parsley; add 1/2 lemon's juice cut the Tony Cachere's seasoning in half; use one tsp of basil. Better yet make your own cajun seafood seasoning mix: 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp garlic powder 1/4 tsp black pepper 1/4 tsp white pepper 1/4 tsp cayeene 1/4 tsp crushed peppers (like you use on pizza) 1/4 tsp cumin 1/2 tsp paprika 1/2 tsp thyme 1/4 tsp oregano 1/4 tsp onion powder-- use 1/2 of this mix and add salt judiciously after tasting the final mix before forming the cakes. I don't know what to do about the sauce-- the cakes are so good alone we don't need it anyway. --Bill",
