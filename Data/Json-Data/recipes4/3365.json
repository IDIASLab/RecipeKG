The combo of tastes worked but it needed something sharp to balance the richness of the sesame oil/mayo. Not extra lemon though. Maybe a tiny splash of rice wine vinegar? I sprinkled some Hawaiian black sea salt on top of the dip & that helped add crunch & an interesting flavor. Pretty cool recipe with few ingredients proving that something doesn't need to be complicated to taste good. Thanks:o)",

I did not find it bland at all; it was really flavorful. But I am using the brands available to me in Tanzania (American Garden Mayo which tends to be strong on the vinegar). It was fantastic with artichokes and a welcome change to melted butter or plain mayo. I always stuff artichokes with bread crumbs olive oil oregano an egg garlic and some sort of cheese. Flavors were great with the dip. I might try adding some yogurt next time just to reduce the expense and calories of so much mayo. 1/2 recipes was plenty for 2 people with leftovers.",
