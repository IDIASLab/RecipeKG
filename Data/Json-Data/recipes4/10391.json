Used regular brown onion instead of shallots. Used garlic & ginger out of jars cos that's what I did have.  Only used 1 tblspn curry paste to experiment with flavour.  Depends on your paste I expect but 4 would have been unbearable.  So test it first.  Didn't use as much water but did add some cornstarch to thicken.  It was really good though & will definitely make again!",
