I subbed another cup of broccoli florets in the final 5 minutes of simmering instead of the lentils. I didn't use celery either. I sauteed the onion and garlic in 1T of OO before adding everything else. The coconut milk really adds a nice smoothness to this soup. I try and make a different soup every week during the winter and this one is already one of my favorites!",
