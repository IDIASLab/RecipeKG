We ate it for dinner two nights in a row, it was so good.\r\nHaving made this so many times, I've played with it a bit and here is how I make it now:\r\nAfter preparing the beef/bean mixture and putting it into the bottom of the pan, I put on the olives, tomatoes, and cheese.  Then I bake it and put on the sour cream and green onions (subbed these for regular onion) when it comes out of the oven.  It is sooooooo much better that way.  The sour cream retains its creamy texture, and the green onions retain their bite.  If the sour cream is baked, it gets kind of curdled and we like it better the other way.  Very very good recipe!",

Well here's how I made it- I took the beef and bean mixture (to which I added the jalapenos) and spread it in the 9 x 13 pan and put the cheese on top of that and baked it. When it came out of the oven I added the sour cream and all the fresh ingredients on top of that (after cooling for a bit). The dip went fast! To be honest this didn't make nearly enough for the crowds we are used to. Next time I will probably triple. Thanks for the recipe!",

After reading all the reviews I could not decide whether to bake the sour cream on the dip or 2 layer it after baking so I decided to make 2 smaller dips and taste both!! (plus I hate when people review a recipe after changing it!!!) The first I made almost exactly as stated (I spiced up the meat mixture some bc it wasn't quite spicy enough for us). I found layering cold sour cream onto the hot meat 2 be difficult. Next time i will sit the sc out &/or stir it while making the meat mixture. I did forget to put the jalapenos tomatoes and onions on b4 baking:( & wish i had done that. WIll next time. Result: Very good!! The other one I layerd the meat w/tomatoes green onions and cheese and baked it then topped it with sour cream mixed with taco seasoning (YUM) & more veggies. It wasn't as pretty but tasted even better to us!!! My opinion is: top the meat mixture with sour cream mixed with taco seasoning layer jalapeno peppers (if you like spicy bc the over bring more heat out of the peppers) green onion and tomatoes cheese then bake then top with more veggies (more jalapenos tomatoes green onions olives etc) and serve with a side of salsa:) to sum it up.... Delicious dip whether the sour cream is baked or not and this dip will be put in rotation for mexican nights and parties! Thanks for reading my novel:)",
