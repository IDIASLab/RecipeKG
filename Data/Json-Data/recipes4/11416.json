I used all the oil to fry the onions and then added the flour straight in without removing the onions. Then I let it go on a very low heat for 15 minutes before adding the buttermilk and water. I think a few changes might give me what I was hoping for. I'm planning to try this again and use butter instead of oil and add in some garlic and onion powders. Thanks for letting me try.",
