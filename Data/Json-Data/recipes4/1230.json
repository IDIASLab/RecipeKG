My experience has told me that anything cooked in a foil packet is going to steam rather than get crispy and this recipe did exactly that. My hope was that the butter would brown them a bit but that didn't happen. They were pale and didn t look appetizing and I think I'm being generous with my 3 rating. I think this would have been much better if done the way I typically roast potatoes in the oven on a baking sheet or in an oven-proof skillet and left uncovered. I may try again but not as written.",

He said he enjoyed himself making it too largely because of the flexibility to be creative with seasonings. The green onions however are a must. The submitter is right - they really do contribute a lot of flavor much more so than just plain onions do. Rather than large baking potatoes we used baby Yukon Golds as we love their creaminess and buttery flavor. Hubs seasoned them with Penzey's Shallot Salt and Penzey's Chicago Seasoning. So many different herbs or spices could be used to season these but I'm sure they're just as delicious as is.",
