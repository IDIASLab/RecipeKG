Be careful when adding the vinegar if you use it at all. I followed the recipe and added it only to find it soured the taste. To balance the taste I had to add some ketchup and brown sugar so that the vinegar wouldn't overpower the sweet and beefy taste. Some advice: taste as you go and add a little bit of everything at a time.",
