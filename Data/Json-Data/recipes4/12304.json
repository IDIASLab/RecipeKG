I decided to use only 1 of the soup mix packages used shallots in place of onions & 2 andouille sausages. So with these changes in mind the dish still had a goodt flavor. I also finished cooking it on the stove I wanted to cut down on the cooking time & keep it w/some extra juice. Not to salty no leftovers. Maybe add a touch of hot sauce next time. I'll make it again.",
