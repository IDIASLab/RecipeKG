For inexperienced cooks, it's no wonder they didn't care for this if they prepared it as the recipe is written, with its excessive amounts of butter and olive oil, and the direction to saute the garlic over such high heat. If made correctly, you will simply drizzle a bit of olive oil in a pan, add a little butter, saute the asparagus until crisp tender, and add the garlic at the very end after lowering the heat.  This is a simple,delicious and classic method of preparing many vegetables in addition to asparagus, worthy of five stars if prepared with the necessary modifications.",

After reading the reviews, I made some of the changes that were suggested and it turned out so good that I wish I had made double the amount!  First I melted just 2 Tbsp of butter, then added sliced mushrooms and cooked them for a few minutes before adding the asparagus so it wouldn't get overcooked because I like it crisp.  Then I drizzled just a little olive oil over the vegetables.  I substituted garlic salt for the coarse salt and garlic cloves because so many people said this was too salty and/or the garlic burned.  I also used lemon pepper instead of regular black pepper and sprinkled a little lemon juice over the vegetables while they were cooking.  After I took them out of the pan, I sprinkled fresh parmesan cheese over them.   This was the best asparagus I have ever eaten!",

This was so simple and the flavor was terrific. I didn't add the garlic until the last few minutes so it didn't burn and I used 2 Tbls. of butter with 1 Tbls. olive oil for 1 lb. of asparagus.

A tip you can use with asparagus: don't just cut off the end. \"Bend\" the asparagus until it breaks naturally. Asparagus will break where it is most tender. That way you don't have to mess with the hard and chewy ends. You can also peel the asparagus but I think that's too much work.",

Finally, I just took a knife to the spears and cut each one in half so I could stir them around easier. Next time I will have to drag out my HUMONGOUS frying pan so I can keep the spears whole. I'm not sure what size pan you other folks are using, but I had my hands full....but since I've never cooked asparagus before, it's probably just my lack of expertise. I agree with some other reviews about cutting back on the butter and even the salt (this is coming from a salt lover). You can add more salt at the table if you feel it needs it.  \r\n",
