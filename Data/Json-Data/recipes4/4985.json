Then I partly cook the ground beef with the onions and garlic and drain, so I can get the grease out of the ground beef.  Then I fill the peppers with the exact ingredients you have listed on your recipe and they go in the oven for about 45 minutes or so.   Sometimes after they come out of the oven I top them with shredded cheese.  This is a fantastic recipe and thank you for reminding me of it...I have not made this in years, so this weekend Stuffed Green Peppers we will have.",
