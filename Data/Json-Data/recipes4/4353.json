I used two big cans of chicken breast 1 standard-sized container light chive and onion cream cheese (didn't have garlic at my grocery) about 2/3 cup Frank's RedHot with the 2 T vinegar and salt/pepper to taste. It filled 15 sheets of phyllo and 5 taco-sized corn tortillas (about 2 T filling in each). I was making these for a small party and one of the people there is on a gluten-free diet which is why I used corn tortillas for some. I just brushed the outside of the corn tortillas with olive oil rolled them up and baked them at the same time and temp as the phyllo-wrapped ones. They were excellent too - had the texture of a taquito or flauta. The recipe as-is is very good but here is one piece of advice if you've never worked with phyllo: 1 T olive oil is not enough! Pour some olive oil in a bowl and very lightly coat the surface of the phyllo with a pastry brush after you've folded it lengthwise. I think I used about 1/4 cup total for what I described above. In the future I will also add some blue cheese crumbles to the filling. Also I made these ahead of time and froze before baking and they turned out great.",
