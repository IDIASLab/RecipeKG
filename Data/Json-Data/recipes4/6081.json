For the egg mixture, used light ranch dressing and added 1 teaspoon Frank\u2019s Hot Sauce. Cut the chicken breasts into roughly 2\" chunks instead of 1\" cubes. It took about 25-30 minutes to cook. We made in two batches, and noticed the second batch was a bit more crunchy after turning off the oven but leaving them in w/ the door cracked open while eating the first batch. Both were really good but preferred the crunchier ones from the second batch. Used honey mustard and BBQ sauce for dipping rather than ranch dressing. We will make these again.",
