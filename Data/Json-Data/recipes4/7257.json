I put a bay leaf in with the chicken breasts while I boiled them for some additional flavor I also used twice the recommended cloves of garlic. Since the potatoes were cold in the refrigerator I heated the potatoes up with a little milk to ensure that they would be hot throughout instead of burnt on the outside and cold inside. I left out the beans and put in some left over corn. I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 baking pan for about 30 minutes. Will probably use this recipe in the fall with left over turkey as well.",

I didn't measure the herbs I probably put more than the recipe called for. Also didn't bother heating the cream of chicken first and just mixed it into the pan before layering it in the casserole.\n\nDidn't have milk and was afraid of it being bland so used 2 cans of cream of chicken which might have been too much for only 1 can of green beans. I think the ratio would work with 1 can cream of chicken per 1 lb chicken breast per 1 can of green beans.",
