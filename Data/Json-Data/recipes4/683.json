I made it using my ice cream maker and between the combination of whipped egg whites and aeration from the ice cream maker it turned it to be quite light in texture. If you like denser ice cream and will be using an ice cream maker I would not recommend whipping the egg whites. In fact I suspect you could even leave the egg whites out but try at your own risk. The flavor was excellent. The honey taste was subtle and if I made it again I would probably use even a little more than the recipe calls for to give it a stronger honey taste. The chocolate covered hazelnuts were excellent. Of the 20 or so ice creams and sorbets that I've made this is definitely my favorite.",
