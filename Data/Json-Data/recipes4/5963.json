I skipped the chopped jalape\u00f1os; but I did add the whole jalape\u00f1os. I was curious about how that method would work. It adds a subtle layer of heat without having to chop the peppers. I also used hot Italian chicken sausage and lean ground turkey for the meat. I suggest browning the onions first in 1/2 tbs olive oil then use the other 1/2 tbs olive oil to cook the turkey separately. After browning the onions and turkey I put everything in the crock pot on high for 4 hours. Next time I might add a chopped tomato to the pot and then a bit of fresh parsley or cilantro in the final minutes if cooking. Top with some sour cream and cheddar cheese and serve with a hearty slice of rustic bread and a green salad for a complete meal.",
