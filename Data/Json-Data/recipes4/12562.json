I used sirloin steak chopped into small cubes instead of ground beef. Once I got everything together it seemed a bit unsubstantial so I added a couple of peeled cubed potatoes and about a cup of frozen green beans. The flavor was wonderful and it was a huge hit with both my wife and my son.",

I said no way. so i substituted the red chili peppers with 3 chipotle in adobe sauce ones and did not add the jalapeno pepper and made it less watery - didn't add the 1 1/2 cups of extra water. I used 2 cups of beef broth and the soup and tomatoe sauce about 8 oz because that's all I had and it cooked down to a nice sauce and was really good. No added black pepper. It just didn't need it. I would make it again for sure. You could even add a few cut up tortillas (4 or so) and let it cook down for a great tortilla soup!",
