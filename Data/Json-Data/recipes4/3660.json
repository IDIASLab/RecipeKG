Couple of minor things: saved a few basil leaves and slivered them over top of the salad and added a bit of sweet aged balsamic vinegar because I usually add that to the tomato version of this salad. Also fresh mozzarella cheese doesn't shred so I chopped it into thin slices. Thanks!",

If pine nuts aren't available or really expensive I've seen walnuts pecans or almonds used but haven't tried it myself. I would wait to add the mozzarella until the pasta is cooler (room temp or if it's been in the fridge for a while) or just before serving. If added warm they start to melt. If you add it while the pasta is cold and let it sit in the fridge it and the pasta tends to absorb the flavor of the pesto. I use fresh fusilli from the farmers market. I also add a few dashes of balsamic vinegar for a little tang and cut through that super fresh herby taste.",

I found myself adding more mozzarella and tomato because the pasta overwhelmed everything else. The pesto is very good and did cover the amount of pasta called for. I made this to take to a bbq and made it the night before; before I left I added a bunch of sliced basil leaves to the salad. It added more color and helped the flavor so if you love basil don't be afraid to add more!:o) This was a lovely pasta salad that is easy and relatively quick to make. It was a hit at the bbq. I had leftovers but it made a ton so keep that in mind. Thanks for the recipe!",
