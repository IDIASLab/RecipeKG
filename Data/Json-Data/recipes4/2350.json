Second, you must strain the onion, garlic and pepper mixture through a fine strainer to remove any excess water.  Third, if you add 50% more bread crumbs, it will hold much better.  Also, I freeze mine and grill them frozen.  Doing this has keep my burgers intact and my mouth happy!  Also, I always follow the spice/hot sauce measurments pretty well, and I do not find it too spicy at all, and I find black pepper to be spicy!  Hope this helps with the loose burger issue.",

Following the advice of others, I blended everything in the food processor, beginning with onions, peppers, and garlic, then oats, then eggs and spices, beans last.  I chilled the mixture, then rolled (more like poured -- think thick muffin batter) onto waxed paper. I froze the burgers.  To grill, I oiled some foil that I folded over burger.  Perfect!

I don't have a food processor so I used my Pampered Chef chopper to finely mince the veggies. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem getting the mixture to stick together\u2014this may have been because I squeezed the excess water from the onions and peppers before adding them (I used pureed garlic). They formed up beautifully and didn't stick at all to a sprayed pan in the oven. I'm thinking of making a double batch, baking it, and freezing them once these first four patties are gone. They would be SO handy to have on hand for those nights you don't want to cook. I ate mine on the \"Tasty Buns\" recipe also found on this site. This recipe makes a large patty, which is the perfect size for the largish buns.",

I made this exactly as written and ended up with a veggie burger that was too wet to hold together in a patty and had an odd spice flavour (too much cumin and not enough salt). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat being said, this recipe is a good base to add to- and that's what most people hear are giving their 5 star rating to. With the addition of: grated zucchini and carrot, salt, pepper, more breadcrumbs, and fresh parsley (and the decrease of cumin), these burgers are very, very good.  This recipe is actually one that works well with just about any grain or legume added (wild rice, lentils, quinoa, green onions) so my recommendation is to think of the recipe as a base to build your own creation from.",
