Then I put half back in the blender with two cups of additional water and blended it again. I did the same with the second half. I got one half gallon out of this recipe. I felt it was more like the consistency of store-bought. I was unhappy about the additives in processed almond milk. I used the leftover nut meal in my morning cereal. I am very happy with the results of this recipe. Thanks!",
