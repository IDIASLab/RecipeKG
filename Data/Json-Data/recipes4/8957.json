                "reviewBody": "I had a difficult time understanding the instructions. I'd recommend the following: 1. Use one not two fennel bulbs. Cut the core from the fennel (it's not as tender). Remove the green top from the bulb and reserve the feather-like leaves for a garnish. 2. Layer the potatoes and fennel vertically not horizontally (like a lasagne). If you do horizontal layers the cream sauce won't reach all of the potatoes. Cut the potatoes like potato chips and stand them on their ends not flat. 3. Consider this a potato dish with the fennel as a twist. The fennel when baked will have a mild flavor. My kids liked it so that was a plus. But if you're looking for WOW! fennel flavor you may want to try it grilled or raw.",

At the end I had saved out some fennel sticks and I sprinkled them raw on top added some shredded smoked provolone and broiled for about 1 minute. The full flavor of the uncooked fennel combined with the provolone gave this the extra punch it needed. I will make it again.",
