The spice level is pretty mild -- maybe habaneros next time? We didn't care for the chilled version and ended up microwaving our bowls a few bites in. It was DELICIOUS warmed. Overall this soup is a great way to use up old greens but it needs a little help to be more flavorful and spicy.",

Not too much water - start with a little and bring it to your preferred consistency. Also 1 handful of rice is also recommended. The key to all this is to keep it all on low heat and constantly mix so the yogurt will not overcook.",
