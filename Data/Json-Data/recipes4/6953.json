I had the opposite experience as the other reviewer - I felt this had a ton of flavor especially given that it's only seasoned with salt and pepper! To make blending the beans easier I removed some liquid from the pot and added that to the beans before blending. This is a very hearty soup and makes 6 good sized portions. I'm looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Thanks for the great recipe sarah!",
