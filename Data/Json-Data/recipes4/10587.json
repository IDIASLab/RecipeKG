The only changes I made were: I used chicken stock instead of water since I had some to use up I added a little red wine added one minced habanero pepper w/out the seeds and after it was done cooking I was a little dissapointed since it looked more like a soup with chunks of chicken in it so I shredded the chicken and it looked more like a traditional chili. The chicken was so soft it literally just fell apart when I smooshed it with the spoon I was using to stir it. It is a very hearty and healthy meal!! I served it with sour cream cheese and biscuits.",
