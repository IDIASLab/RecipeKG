Instead of transferring everything to a different baking dish I just added the wine and stock into the same pan, moved the onion mixture to the sides and added the lamb back into the original pan (I started with an ovenproof pan with a cover. One less dish to wash.) I added carrots and potatoes for the last hour and a half. Again, less pots and pans and they soak up that wonderful juice. When ready, I plated the meat and veggies, turned the stove to high, and added a tbsp of corn starch mixed with a half cup of cold water to the remaining juices in the pan. I added a tsp of Worcestershire sauce, some fresh chopped parsley and mint, let it thicken and poured this lovely sauce all over the meat and veggies. Garnish with extra mint and parsley and you've got yourself a 5 star restaurant quality meal there!",
