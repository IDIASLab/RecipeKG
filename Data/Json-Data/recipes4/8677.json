I made individual pizzas used garlic & herb flavored tortillas (oven baked for a few minutes to crisp them up) then topped them with Webber spicy sausage store-brand lite Alfredo sauce and finely shredded mozzarella. The flavored tortillas were a little too much - plain would have been better. But each mini-pizza along with a simple side salad made an unusual and very satisfying meal. This recipe is definitely worth trying especially since it's so versatile that you can make it to suit your taste.",
