I made these dumplings exactly as written even though it seemed to be a bit excessive in the baking powder...I was correct about that! The dough seemed fine and so I proceeded to add them to my turkey soup. Once in the pot however they fell apart completely making a thick unappetizing and chunky soup. The fragments weren't dumpling -like at all...they were soggy and mushy. My family was extremely disappointed and so was I. Sorry but I won't be making these again!",
