Easy to put together, much more economical and the taste was fabulous.  I brine turkeys in a 5 gallon bucket with a lid.  I reduce the liquid in the recipe and put ice in the bucket after placing the turkey in it.  I set the bucket in the garage and in the cooler months the ice stays frozen overnight and well into the next day.  In the warmer months I add ice as needed.",

I brined the turkey for 48hrs washed it out and let it sit for an hour while preparing the stuffing. Then I put my Martha Stuart reading materials to use and stuffed the bird with help of a cheese cloth. Shortly after I lathered my hands up with butter and went to work on the bird. We squeezed a bunch of lemon on it when all was buttered & ready to cook. Then I based it a few times while cooking but not all that frequently. The brining really kept the bird sufficiently moist and tender without the nuisance of constant basting. Both the dark and white meat was extremely moist and tender. My family were truly amazed and we will definitely do this again next year! (now that they know what brining is)",
