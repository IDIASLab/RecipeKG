I thought it was a disaster because I have never made brisket before. It was a huge success and my husband who is a major ham fan stated that he didn't miss it at all!!! Anyway followed the recipe exactly only doubled the ingredients because my brisket was over 9 pounds. Also I slow cooked this at 225 all night long(covered of course). Was just so easy and so delicious!!! THANK YOU! --- P.S - The leftovers(if you have any) make great BBQ sandwiches as well as taco filler with the right seasoning additions oh my goodness this is so versatile!!! Edit to say that the second time I made this I used the crockpot. I MUCH preferred the slow and low oven cooked version that I utilized the first time. I suggest the oven preparation for sure.",

I made this one in the oven instead of a crock pot (since it was over 8lbs vs the 4lbs in the recipe) and slow cooked it (covered) on 200 degrees all night long.  Came out TENDER and juicy in the morning!  Make sure to bake FAT SIDE UP.  I also added a bit of brown sugar.  Note, this will NOT be one of those brikets with a crunchy sugary glaze, but very moist and tender like a roast.  Makes for excellent sandwitches!",
