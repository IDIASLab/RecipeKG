I was a bit nervous after hearing so many mixed opinions about caribou meat -gamey/tough/dry etc. A friend gave us a nice caribou shoulder so..here we are..eating this Caribou stew for dinner!! I made this EXACTLY as written. I have to say....I would have thought it was beef stew if I didn't know better. This made a great big crockpot full of stew...my in laws came over to have dinner with us and they too enjoyed it and thought it was beef. Anyways...thumbs up all around here:) Thank you for a great recipe:)",
