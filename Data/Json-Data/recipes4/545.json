I made this for the first time tonight, and my husband and kids loved it and asked when I will be making it again.  I also made a gravey using the chicken bits in the pan and it turned out delicious (I think the gravey made the meal).  Topped the chicken and mashed potatoes with it and served with a side of steamed vegies.  Perfect fast, easy, delicious, healthy dinner for those nights when you get home from after school sports, etc.  Forget the run to McDonalds on the way home from baseball!***UPDATE***I still make this once a week and when my kids ask what's for dinner and I tell them this, they get very excited!  Be sure to try it with the gravey...After the chicken is done cooking add 3T butter and melt it, then add 3T flour and use a spatula or whisk to stir the flour and scrape up the chicken bits, the darker the rue the better, then whisk in about a cup and a half of chicken stock, more or less depending on how thick you like it.  YUM!",

Just dice about half an onion and use fresh chopped garlic (to your taste). That way the only salt product is the seasoning salt. I also added some fresh ground black pepper. Be careful with the cooking time if you use fresh onion and garlic. I cook mine until it all browns up nicely (which makes a nice sauce in the pan...great if serving with rice) but you need to make sure the chicken is cooked through esp. if some of the breasts are very thick. Even with these minor changes...it is still quick easy and a great recipe!",

When the meal was ready removed the chicken and made gravy out of what was left in the pan. It was delicious and has become my favorite way to cook chicken.",

I Followed advice of another and used fresh chopped onion and garlic instead of powdered. I sauteed chicken until browned on both sides then I added a 8.4 oz. box of low sodium chicken broth. I covered it and let cook over medium heat until chicken was done. This made the chicken very moist and tender. Then I removed chicken from the pan. I added about 1 TBL. of corn starch mixed with about 1-1 1/2 c. cold water to the remaining butter and onion in the pan. I cooked this whisking the entire time until thick and bubbly. This made an excellent sauce to pour over the chicken. I served it with parmesan egg noodles on the side but it would also be good with the chicken and sauce served over plain egg noodles or mashed potatoes.",
