I caught him just as he was pouring melted butter over it all. So ok I let the chicken cook in the oven as recipe specifies for 30 mins. Took the buttery goodness from the chicken pan and poured it into a 9x13. Laid the mostly defrosted asparagus spears (I used frozen so omitted the cook time) on the bottom of pan placed chicken breasts on top and went to make the cream soup/milk mixture. I had cream of celery and no milk so I used water instead. Poured it over the chicken/asparagus. Sprinkled the Italian Seasoned bread crumbs a little generously. The result very tasty! But much to liquidy. Definitely need to use the milk or if using water I'd say cut it in half....Thanks for the recipe. It worked out in the end:-)",

It was OK the asparagus soup I made out of the leftover base was much better. Reminds me of the rich mans tuna casserole using chicken and asparagus instead of tuna and peas.",
