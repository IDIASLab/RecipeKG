Was a little shy on the milk, so I added a bit of heavy cream (maybe 1/4 cup) I had left in the fridge.  Used baby bella mushrooms (1 lb), and added a little more flour to reach the mushroom soup consistency I like.  I gave the soup a pretty good grind of fresh nutmeg.  Although it's a subtle background flavor, I think it's essential and sets this recipe apart from others.  This soup is mellow but still rich and has that earthiness that I so love in a good mushroom soup.  Not only is this easy to prepare, it's DELICIOUS, and I wouldn't change a thing.

I added minced garlic to the mushroom onion mix tho\u2019 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d say it was a critical addition.  Only because the milk I used was reduced-fat, I compensated by using equal parts half-and-half and milk to give it a little more richness.  Loved the hint of nutmeg\u2013 it was a distinct but subtle touch.  Mainly because I had them to use, I threw in some fresh chives along with the parsley \u2013 I liked the little bite of flavor they added.  Had I not added the chives or the garlic, however, I doubt I would have enjoyed this any less.",
