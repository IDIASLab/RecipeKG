My husband makes fun of me for eating it, but hey, when you have $10 to buy a weeks worth of groceries and you only have a dorm frig, this is some great stuff. I still eat it when I want an easy meal. I'm not a big fan of American single slices, so I like to add shredded cheddar. I also like to stir in an egg when the water is boiling... kind of makes an egg drop soup type dish. I lived next door to some students from Hong Kong who ate the same stuff, only they put cut up hot dogs in it too. Not a hot dog fan, but hey... if you like it!",
