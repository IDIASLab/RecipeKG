Of course there were a few changes - I added some butter when frying the onion garlic and carrot. No celery. I rinsed the rice thoroughly and added it to the frying pan to coat in all the butter/oil and then added the two cups of stock. I covered it the whole time and when I checked it at the halfway point it was drying out so I added an extra half a cup of stock and some garlic powder and onion powder as it was a bit bland. It came out really fluffy and tasty but did need a hit of salt - but I hadn't salted it as stock can be salty so I waited till the end. A real lifesaver for me as I can't ever seem to cook rice on the stovetop with any measure of success.",
