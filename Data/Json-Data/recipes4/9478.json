I had to add twice as much sugar a tablespoon of milk and a teaspoon of vanilla to make it usable. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I'm sure there are other people who are looking for a very unsweet straight chocolate icing. I just made a bad recipe choice based on the simple ingredient list and directions. (I was looking for \"vanilla-chocolate powdered sugar frosting\" which I HIGHLY recommend) I MIGHT use this one SPARINGLY (spread thinly) either between cookie sandwiches or on top of them but never on a cake.",

The frosting was very pretty and glossy but it took a while to get it to the right consistency. It took way more sugar than called for to make it perfect. I also added just a little bit of vanilla flavoring. Very yummy with chocolate cupcakes. I will never buy frosting from the store again. Thanks for sharing.",

So I looked on here for something easy with few ingredients and I found this. So happy that I did. I must point out however that it is VERY import to use real stick butter. The second time I made it with my boyfriend it was watery because I used tub margarine. Also this afternoon I used the recipe to make truffles. I decreased the amount of water to about 2 tbs. rather than 3 and didn't use the full 1 1/2 cup of powder sugar. The mix was thicker so I made drops and put them on wax paper on a pan in the freezer and after an hour they were perfect. Sprinkle with cocoa powder and powdered sugar. Bravo.",
