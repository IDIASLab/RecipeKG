I 'lightened' them up by only using one slice of bacon and one slice of cheese per burger. All kidding aside - IF I were to make these again I would either place them on a rack over a lined sheet pan or do them on the grill indirect. I used non-stick Reynolds foil on the sheet pan they did not stick but I did not like them sitting in a pool of grease. (Yes I used lean beef) The 'boys' got a kick out of these!",
