Can be made ahead and left to marry, which increases the flavour and you don't need too much curry powder, (use more if eating without ripening)",

I found that there were too many unnecessary ingredients competing w/ one another in the salmon patties, and that sometimes less is more. That's not to say that these didn't taste good, but I actually was less thrilled w/ the texture - very poofy and squishy on the inside, but well-browned and crispy on the exterior, making me think that I should've made 10 or even 12 smaller patties instead of 8 large. I think if I made this recipe again, I'd do just that, along w/ using plain panko instead of Italian-seasoned, and drop the dijon mustard and/or parmesan - Old Bay is flavorful enough. Thanks Judiebug - salmon patties w/ mac n'cheese on the side is one of our favorite Spring comfort meals!",
