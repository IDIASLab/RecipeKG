My only comment is to tell folks to heat the fat in the pan at 400 degrees for 15 min. before adding batter. Some may think it's sizzling after 5 min. & results won't be as good if fat not hot enough. Do Not open oven door while it is cooking.  And also - I had to use a blender to get it light & frothy.  Wisking by hand just didn't do it for me.  End results - great.",

I altered slightly, using 1/2 the H2o recommended, subbing 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c oil for the fat (I like to save the drippings for gravy) and using whole milk.  It puffed out nicely with a crisp crust that is a pleasure to serve to company.  The most important step to good Yorkies is to heat the fat first!!",

So we tried different things like letting the batter rest for periods of time, including overnight.  They would taste good, but there was not enough rising.  We tried this recipe and the results were AMAZING!  We have never been so excited about this!  We had such success.. they turned out HUGE!  I'm not sure what the trick was here, but we beat the batter for a long time to make sure it was really smooth, and even without letting it rest they turned out beautifully.  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe Mort Tibble, you have made us VERY happy!",

                "reviewBody": "I have been making Yorkies for the last 20 years on a weekly basis and have some tips for those people who say that their puds don't rise. First of all, I use yorkshire pudding pans I bought in England. If you don't have these use muffin pans. Second, I use 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil or vegetable shortening per slot. It has a higher smoking point than butter and olive oil. Thirdly, put your pan in the oven for at least 15 minutes before filling with batter. I take mine out of the oven and put the pan over a direct heat from the oven top and I also put the batter in a jug and pour them in while the pan is over direct heat. They will sizzle and set and THAT is the key. Put them back in the oven and set the timer for 25 mins. They will rise beautifully. I usually make the batter about an hour before I put them in the oven and have never had a problem. Do NOT use any leavening agent such as baking powder/soda. They just don't taste right. I also cut the salt to a half teaspoon and add a good grinding of freshly milled black pepper. I hope this helps those who are having trouble getting their puds to rise.",

The puddings were crispy on the outside and stayed \"puffed\" even after I took them out of the oven. I didn't use the beef drippings though. I prefer the flavor of melted butter instead. All 12 of my Christmas dinner quests raved! I'll make these again and again. UPDATE: I made these again tonight only I used a mini-muffin tin. I liked the texture and size even better than the regular muffin size. Next time I will try adding Parmesan cheese to the batter to see how it tastes. So many possibilities. Another Update: Don't add Parmesan cheese.... it's too heavy for the batter and they wont rise.",

I did them in indivdual pans the way my mother used to do them ( I used 6 small loaf pans), and baked them for 25 minutes.  Each pan took about 2 Tbls. fat and a tad less than 1/2 cup batter.\nThank you for a great recipe.\nI've copied many recipes, but this is my first review---because I absolutely needed to\nlet everyone know how great this is.
