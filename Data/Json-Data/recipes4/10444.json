Used only 1/2c light Teriyaki sauce and 1tbsp light soy sauce but I also only used about 1c cooked jasmine rice. Used more pepper and added just a smidgen of crushed red pepper for added spice. I wrapped the mixture up in lettuce leaves for a completely cholesterol-free meal. Very tasty!",

It still seemed like too much rice. I added black beans and cut the teriyaki sauce back to about 2/3 cup and the soy sauce (I used low salt) back to 2 Tbsp. I cut out the salt altogether and it was still a bit on the salty side. It just didn't seem to work well with the flat bread either. Tortilla wraps probably would have been better. I doubt I will make this again. This recipe feeds closer to 8 people.",

I did not use as much Teriyaki sauce as was called for simple because I did not have that much. I used 1/2 cup of Teriyaki Sauce and this seemed plenty. I did not use as much salt due to how much is normally in Teriyaki and Soy Sauce. I used 2 fresh cloves of garlic instead of the garlic seasoning. I did add three chicken breasts which I first cut into strips then browned in the pan prior to cooking veggies. I took the chicken out of the pan while the veggies did their thing and added the chicken back in at the same time I added the rice. I think had a used as much Teriyaki Sauce as was called for the end result would have been fairly soupy. The only way to have avoided that would have been to reduce the sauce by boiling or reduce the amount of Teriyaki put in from the beginning. Great recipe definately going to be done again at our home. Thanks for the Recipe!",
