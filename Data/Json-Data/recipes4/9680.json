There are wonderful packaged chicken stocks and broths in the grocery store. Secondly, once you've made your roux, start slowly adding your stock. You won't get any lumps this way. Adding the other ingredients first makes no sense to me. Then add the rest of the ingredients. Definitely needed a lot more seasonings. Also added some fresh chopped parsley as a garnish. This was a great place to start Rebecca and a good way to use up some leftover chicken. Soup was hearty and very tasty. Thanks!",

First, I sauteed a whole large yellow onion with three cloves of garlic - then added the roux ingredients and cooked it until bubbly and just starting to turn brown. I, then, added 8 cups of chicken broth (slowly at first), four cups of water and the rest of the called-for ingredients (except for the salt) - plus some baby carrots for sweetness, and some pre-cooked bacon for smokiness. Then, I added a half teaspoon of cayenne, a few pinches of nutmeg and about 15 shakes of mexican hot sauce. At the 45 minute mark, I removed about a litre of the soup (for use later) - then added the creme and cheddar, as well as about 1/2 cup parmesan. Wonderful!!!",

The addition of the chicken was such a nice change, and all agreed that it was a meal all by itself.  I did make a few changes, just to make it easier on myself.  I picked up an already roasted chicken from the grocery store and just cut up the breast into bite-sized pieces, and I used 2 bags of frozen broccoli florets, instead of the fresh.  Obviously, I didn't need to simmer the soup nearly as long.  I also added some sauteed onion and garlic, a bit of cayenne pepper, and about 8 oz. of velveeta cheese.  It turned out beautifully!\n\nThanks again for the recipe.  It's going in the \"keeper\" pile for certain!",

I boiled the chicken first and shredded it first instead of cutting it in chunks and also used 4 cans of chicken broth instead of the bullion. When it was time to add the thickening agent I actually poured out some of the broth into the flour and butter and wisked that together separatly so there were no lumps. Then I added garlic salt and an extra cup of cheese. Excellent!!",
