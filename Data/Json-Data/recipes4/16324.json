I've been relying on packaged stuff, but now I can proudly offer these, and feel awesome about how they are homemade and preservative free. :D\n\nI used olive oil instead of coconut oil and craisins instead of dates. I actually made them for my niece who just had a c-section, but doubled it and kept some for myself. I can't stop eating them. And I goofed and mixed the honey in, instead of drizzling it on top.

I also added about 1/2 cup applesauce. I subbed sliced almonds for the pecans and raisins for the dates (what I had on hand). I think the recipe is really forgiving and you could easily substitute some pumpkin puree for some of the mashed banana and swap in your favorite nut butter oil seeds nuts dried fruit. Can't wait to experiment with my next batch!",
