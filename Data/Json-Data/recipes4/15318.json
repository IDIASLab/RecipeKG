My mouth has been watering all week just thinking about it.  Well let me just say that it was WELL worth the wait.... served over Jasmine rice and I absolutely LOVED it!  I made a double batch to have plenty to eat thru the weekend and maybe for lunch at work next week.  I made a couple of changes from the written instructions, and it came out just fine.  1) I wasn't too sure about the idea of baking yogurt-covered chicken, plus I don't trust the oven in my apartment, so I decided I'd cook them by simmering them with the rest of the ingredients.  I cut the chicken into small cubes (about sugar cube size), rather than strips to help them cook more quickly.  I marinated them as directed, then added them (including all of the yogurt marinade) where directed to in the instructions.  Simmered everything for about 15-20 minutes to make sure everything was cooked.  The chicken stayed extremely tender since I didn't give it a chance to dry out in the oven.  2) I realized as I was opening the tomato paste that I bought the one with italian spices in it...sigh...  So I scrapped the paste and went with a can of tomato sauce instead, and just left out the water the recipe calls for.  3) Added an extra 1/4 cup of cream to make the sauce go a little further.",

                "reviewBody": "Amazing, restaurant quality Tikka Masala. Makes an impressive dish with complex, aromatic flavors that blend together nicely. A bit time consuming to prepare but well worth the effort. For the marinade, used non-fat Greek plain yogurt, and marinated the chicken for four hours instead of two. For the remainder of the recipe, subbed ground cumin since didn\u2019t have cumin seeds, 2 serrano peppers w/ seeds for green chile peppers, 1/4 cup chicken broth for water, and 1/2 cup coconut milk for heavy whipping cream. The main caution for achieving a successful outcome is to consider the heat tolerance for whoever is eating this dish. Green chile (a/k/a Anaheim chile, California Green) peppers range from mild and sweet to moderate hot. On the Scoville Heat Index, a jalapeno pepper can easily exceed 2X the value of a green chile, and a serrano pepper can easily exceed 4X its value; removing the seeds & ribs will also reduce the heat (if not sure, reserve these and add in later if desiring more heat or add some cayenne pepper to taste). For folks who like Indian cuisine, this will be a keeper.",

Unfortunately, I don't live near any good Indian restaurants, so my fianc\u00e9 and I resort to buying the simmer sauces if we are desperate for a taste of Indian and don't feel like driving to a decent Indian place.  I found this recipe and after reading these reviews, I decided to take a chance and make this.  I had all the spices on hand even though they were already ground.  I just slightly decreased the amount of spice where fresh was called for, such as ginger and cumin seeds.\n\nEverything else I used was fresh.   Because I already had so many dry, ground spices, I decided to look up an easy recipe for garam masala too (also on this website; recipe by zen sojourner).  \n\nI used a lot of the tips provided by other reviewers, such as using nonfat Greek yogurt, light coconut milk, and the dry spices that I already had on hand and wanted to use up.\n\nI marinated the chicken for 4-5 hours, and baked according to the directions.  After I turned off the oven, I left in for 30 min.  After I finished cooking the tomatoes, I followed the rest of the recipe.  My fianc\u00e9 and I got distracted and left the pot on a low simmer for the next hour.  I was worried that we might have overlooked it.  The sauce was thick, which I didn't mind as I don't like watery sauces.  It tasted delicious.  My fianc\u00e9 said it was the best curry he's ever had.  It might not taste like the real thing to some one who is Indian, but we loved it and will be sure to make again -so easy.",
