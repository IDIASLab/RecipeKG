I was raised by a woman whose grandparents survived the War Between the States and who had lived through both WWII and the Great Depression. She NEVER used an egg to batter anything -- they couldn't afford it then. She coated her chicken with only seasoned flour. The secret to really good fried chicken is to handle as little in the pan as possible and only turn it once.",

Good healthy color for the chicken, not as crispy as I would like... but all-in-all an easy to follow, good recipe.",

I do however think the cook time is too long. I tested my chicken 5 minutes before time and it was already at 200 degrees so I'm thinking maybe 10 minutes each side, maybe even less. Besides that the chicken was perfect! Making the gravy with some of the leftover flour however was not a good idea; it did not have a good flavor at all. I want to end on a good note so I'll state again, GREAT chicken! Thanks for the recipe! :)",
