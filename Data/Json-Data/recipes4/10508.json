I browned the chops then put all ingredients in a crockpot and cooked on low for about 4 hours... meat was soo moist..could cut with a fork! I also used low sodium soy sauce. I think I could have used about half the soy/teriyaki and would have had plenty to cover the chops and cook..seemed like a lot of sauce was wasted...but overall great flavor and with some tweaking is a keeper!",
