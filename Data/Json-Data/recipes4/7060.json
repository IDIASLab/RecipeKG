We had smoked our Thanksgiving turkey so it was extra flavorful.  I think I'm hooked- now I can't wait to try other fillings.  There is absolutely nothing intimidating about making tamales anymore!  We looked online just to make sure we were making the masa the right consistency and were wrapping them correctly, it's really an easy process.  These freeze beautifully too- just steam them to reheat.  We served with a red sauce and queso fresco.",
