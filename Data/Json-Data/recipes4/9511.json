Use cut up paper clips (each clip will give you 3 units) for the hangers, easier than making holes and looks better too.  Also you can use cake food coloring paste to color the dough instead of painting it afterwards.  Keeping dough in zip lock bags work for a few days and then just add either water or flour to freshen up.  It's not necessary to roll out flat.  I did some pretty thick ornaments and used a lower degree (200) for a longer time.  Less puffing.  Use a garlic press to create hair & beards.  Lots of fun!!!",

                "reviewBody": "I am not a \"pro\" but here are some tips:\n1.) Use food coloring in dough so no need to paint! Food coloring fades with baking, so make dough several shades darker.  \n2.) Roll dough in one direction (up-up-up or down-down-down)  When rolling \"up-down-up-down\" it makes an uneven surface of hills & valleys. Rolling in one direction gives a nice level cookie surface.  3.)  Thicker rolled cookies puffed more, but if you let them sit out an hour before baking, it puffed much less.  Ideal thickness 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch.  Baking at 275-300 for a longer time also decreased puff.  Not all puff was bad, some of our shapes looked great puffy, like our tree & ornament shape, like a 3D effect.  4.)  Keep dough in a ziplock and pull out only what you need.\n5.)  Puffy paints great for \"icing\".\n6.)  Straws were perfect for making holes.  Holes shrink a bit w baking, straws are pefect circle size.\n7.)  Bake on a non-stick or parchment paper so they slip off easily and don't break.\n8.)  Several thin layers of Mod Podge brand were great sealant, do this after you finish painting decorations, etc..\n9.) Add 2 - 4 tsp of allspice to dough for a beautiful speckled appearance\n10.) Squeeze a pea-sized dollop of glitter glue onto ornament & smear w finger.  Gives ornament a pretty sparkly sheen.\n11.)  Paint & seal on top of waxpaper sheets.  Easy clean-up, no sticking or ruined ornaments.",
