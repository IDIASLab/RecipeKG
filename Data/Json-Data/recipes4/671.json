I seasoned pork chops with garlic powder salt and pepper. Browned in olive oil. I made the \"Cherry Sauce for Ham\" recipe from this site (pie filling tablespoon brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon mustard). I poured the sauce over the chops and basted them and turned them in the sauce several times. Placed lid on chops for a few minutes to finish cooking. Very tender and lightly cherry flavored. Served with garlic dill steamed new potatoes.",

I want to add that the left over meat and sauce made OUTSTANDING sandwiches.  The family liked this for dinner and RAAAVED over it the next day in sandwiches and continue to request more of it for sandwiches.  Oh.. and it helps to brown the chops before putting into the crock pot because, in my opinion, the flavor and presentation appeal are improved that way.",
