Heat butter in a saucepan in high-medium heat until it boils or bubbles. 2. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook uncovered until butter turns to a clear golden color. (Butter usually begins to boils with lots of bubbles. When it is done it will have foams on top of it indicating that ghee is nearly done.) 3. Cool it and store it in dry container. Use ghee in you regular cooking. I added I can of rinsed chickpeas/garbanzo beans and served it with whole wheat naan this is how a local indian restaurant we go to has served it. Also its took me no more the 30 minutes from start to finish with clean up. Be careful the yellow colored sauce tends to stain things.",

Ended up mild (but that was no surprise since that s what it is supposed to be!) so it wasn t my favorite next time I will probably add more peas and double the spices- and probably add some either ground or rough cut onions when the potatoes go in. Overall really nice texture. I would serve this with Naan and not Rice however the potatoes and rice made too much of a similar texture and I didn t like it at all. Also be aware that it will thicken a bit as it sets out- so make it a little thinner than you would like- just add more water as you need. Really simple base recipe you could take a lot of places! I think this is especially a good recipe if you are trying to get someone into the world of curries. A good beginner dish if you will because of the mildness. Thanks for the recipe!",
