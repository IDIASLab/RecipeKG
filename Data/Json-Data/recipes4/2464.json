Once filled with stuffing and wrapped with bacon (which I did not pre-cook), I placed the chicken bundles in the slow cooker and cooked them on high for 2.5 hours while I took my son to football practice.  When we got home, they were cooked perfectly!  I put them under the broiler for 10 minutes to crisp the bacon.  The chicken was juicy and delicious.  I really like this recipe.\n",
