Possible reasons for failure in other cooks' attempts at this bread could include the previously mentioned abundance of sugar in the recipe(pie filling, apple juice, additional white sugar), as well as the cinnamon.  Cinnamon (like garlic) is a natural enemy of yeast!  I've found the best way to work around this is to add the cinnamon later in the cycle - my machine has a beeper that tells you when to add ingredients such as raisins or nuts toward the end of the knead cycle, and that's when I sprinkle in the cinnamon.  As for the sugar, I didn't have a problem but perhaps you could try reduced sugar pie filling?",

I don't think I let the bread rise quite long enough before baking -- the top split -- but I was pleased with the results. It was a little on the heavy side but not rock-like. It would make a good breakfast/dessert bread. Update 1/18/05 I finally broke down and got a bread machine. I ended up having to adjust the flour on this a bit to get a good consistency dough. Once it was at that nice \"tacky\" stage it came out beautifully. Flavor was kind of subtle not a hit you over the head \"apple pie\" but even my picky DS likes it! Loaf came out an even pale tan color since the machine churned the apples up completely. The recipe name is a little misleading but the bread is tasty!",
