This means a cheese steak with Cheeze Whiz&reg; and with or without fried onions. This is a cheese steak in a dip. Perfect for tailgating or football games and is best served in a slow cooker with cut-up hoagie/sub rolls. Enjoy!",

The \"Whiz-Wit\" Dip Reviewed: Jan. 2 2011 Let me start by saying I hope AR accepts and publishes this recipe. It turned out phenomenal! I was going to make it for NYE but plans changed and I didnt so I decided to make it for the Eagles vs Cowboys game today.I hope it makes it that long. I made it exactly as written with the exception of leaving out the roasted red peppers b/c I forgot to buy them. I used my own canned jalapenos from my garden which gave it just the right kick. I am using sliced and halved Italian bread. Next time I think I will buy a couple of french baguettes and toast them alittle. Thanks JJsmama for this AWESOME dip! I will be making this again! Fast forward to 2014... I make this highly requested dip to take with me every Eagles home game parking lot tailgating party. Come visit us in Lot M/N to give it a try next time you are in Philly!",

Here is my original review: We just got done eating this for our 'dip night' and oh my this stuff is AWESOMELY DELICIOUS! I did it a little differently but with great results only because I wanted to assemble it ahead of time and cook it later. I cooked the meat and onions and combined those put them into my mini slow cooker and added all the other ingredients (including the optional ingredients) and put it into the fridge until I was ready to cook it. When I was ready I just put it on low and let it go for about 1-1/2 hours stirring occasionally. Everything melted perfectly! I served it with lightly toasted italian bread pieces. This was a HUGE hit with all of us even my little guy. Thanks so much JJsMama for sharing this new dip favorite that I will be making very often YUM!:)",
