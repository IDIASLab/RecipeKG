I think there was too much nutmeg and the rum extract tasted out of place.  I tried this once the day I made it and once the following day, thinking it might taste better after giving the flavors a chance to come together, but there was no improvement.  ",

It seems to me more of a breakfast rice than a dessert. The maple syrup is very tasty in it. I left out the rum extract and cut down on the nutmeg. I used a quick cook brown rice so I followed the package directions to cook the rice and then followed the recipe from once the rice was cooked.",
