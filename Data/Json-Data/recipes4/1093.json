We usually serve them on a Friday night (especially during Lent) with potato soup, bread and butter, the pancake topped with the traditional granulated sugar with applesauce on the side.  We are a German/Polish family.  Leftovers were taken in sandwiches with butter, salt and pepper for lunch.  Don't fret about the discoloration...it is a part of the pancake and never noticed after fried up.  When 5 pounds of potatoes are grated by hand for a large family, the discoloration is not a problem.Don't spend a lot of time and trouble drying out the potatoes, just drain in a colander and the flour takes care of the rest.  If a little drains from the pancake in the fry pan, it will just add a nice crispiness to the edge.  ENJOY.  Our family has for over 100 years.",

The easiest thing to do is as you scrape them imediately put them in cold water so they aren't exposed to the air. They'll stay a beautiful white. Just be sure to drain them really good before frying.\n\nA plus side to soaking them first is that they are much crisper when you fry them up. Not only do they look better but they taste better too!",

I solved the oxidation problem by shredding the potatoes one at a time in my food processor and emptying it into a bowl of cold water after each potato.  I had read that when making homemade french fries to put them in cold, even ice water and then dry them before frying.  I then took a handful at a time and squeezed them in the collander and added them to the egg mixture.  This worked great.  There was no change in color, or if there was it was limited.  Once dinner was over I quickly put the leftovers in plastic baggies and put them in the freezer, hopefully this will keep them from oxidizing.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!!!",

This recipe is easy and sooooo good, impresses my husband every time!  I do have a little trick that cuts down on the moisture from the potatoes - if you peel and boil the whole potatoes the night before (boil for only a few minutes).  Then, cover and refrigerate the potatoes until morning.  This will make shredding so much easier on the arms if you are doing it manually and it also cuts down on the moisture!",
