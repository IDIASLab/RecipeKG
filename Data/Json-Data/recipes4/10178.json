Two other tips, I think in America we've been trained to go easy with salt, but she added quite a bit of salt to hers and I think that's the way it's prepared and served in Russia, with a lot of salt, and the skin should be removed from the potatos. I enjoyed this soup very much.",

It brings the freshness and just enhances the flavor of the stock. One more tip please don't put bay leaves and lots of black pepper into the soup. They convert the basic flavor of your fish. And don't dice the potatoes make a potato balls using a special little coring scoop. Parsley and lemon for garnishing of course. Basically when you are making a stock you should cook onions (whole! then you'll damp them away) potatoes and parsley root!!! this is the Russian trad. soup making way. Thanks for attention. Alex.",
