                "reviewBody": "I bought a vacuum-sealed tri-pack of Butterball\u00ae ground turkey.  Mixed up this meat loaf thinking that the turkey was a 1 lb pkg (why, WHY do they package turkey like this?) and then when I was cleaning up, noticed that the pkg held 22 oz, not 16 (my mistake).  So this meat loaf ended up with an extra 6 oz of turkey.  The only negative comment I have is that it was a bit on the dry side, and I think it should have come out of the oven sooner.  Even with the additional meat, after the final 20 minutes in the oven, I checked the temp for doneness, and it was 189 degrees F (instead of 160).  I will be checking the temperature in the future much earlier, and adjust the time as necessary (or just reduce the temp to 350).  I liked the combination of the ground sirloin and turkey for meat loaf, the flavor was very good. I always use chili sauce (like that extra tang you get)  instead of catsup when making meat loaf, so overall, I was pleased with the way this turned out. I made a couple small changes...used freshly-minced garlic, subbed Egg Beaters for the whole egg, but did use the fresh egg whites.  Thanks, Betsy, for a healthier meat loaf (good sandwiches coming for the rest of the week).",
