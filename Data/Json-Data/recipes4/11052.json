It was too much steak sauce for me. I also only used 8oz of sour cream and it was plenty. I did find this plenty \"soupy\" but I just didn't care for the flavor that much.

It was very thick and really no flavor and 2 hrs in the crock pot is not enough time to tenderize round steak. I followed the recipe exactly. I have now added a can of beef consomme hot sauce Worcestershire sauce garlic powder and mushrooms. I am just hoping that the additional cooking time will not turn the noodles into mush. This is really a beef stroganoff not a soup. Brittany I am sorry;( I know how disappointing it is when someone doesn't like a recipe but everyone tastes are different and others have liked it so Thank you for sharing! It just wasn't for me!",
