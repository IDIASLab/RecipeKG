I gave it 5 * because of the changes I added to it. I par boiled my potatoes whole for about 15-20 min. Just until fork goes in fairly easy when tested. Cooled completely. I used klondike gold potatoes. I used really large ones. I used Bertolli alfredo in the jar. Used 2 jars because my potatoes filled a 13x9 dish pretty full. So I doubled all the ingredients listed. I didn't use the onion because too many in the family don't like them. I added mined garlic about a tsp. Added italian seasoning. I don't measure but it was a good size pinch. Along with the parsely. Did'nt add any salt because of the salty cheeses. Added a lot of black pepper and cayenne. Added a bit more swiss and fresh grated parm.than called for. Baked about an hour. 15 minutes before I took it out I topped it with more swiss and parm and sprinkled with panko crumbs and stuck it under the broiler. Everybody raved about these at our Easter dinner! As far as I was concerned it was the best part of the meal! Thanks for posting!",
