I wanted to do them open-face style so I first boiled the halved poblanos for about 5 minutes to soften and then plunged into cold water to stop the cooking. Since I had 12 halves to stuff I was able to increase the stuffing amount so I doubled the amount of mushrooms (cremini) and Parmesan cheese (the real kind) and diced up a tomato and mixed it in. I had no creole seasoning so I improvised with some chilli powder, cumin, cayenne and salt and pepper to taste. After stuffing I topped them with a sprinkle of smoked paprika and baked at 350 for about 25 minutes. I covered them with foil for the first 15 minutes but it probably wasn't necessary. The peppers were perfectly tender and the result was yum!",
