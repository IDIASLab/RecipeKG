The lamb I used was a bit tough (haven't had the best luck with the recipe I used to cook it in the first place, but gets unique flavor that I like) but this recipe turned the lamb to butter!  It was amazing.  I followed another reviewers advice and simmered the lamb in beef stock then used that to make the gravy.  I made the mistake of thinking my bacon was too thick and so used half of it but my husband and I both wished it had more bacon.  It was amazing.  The potatoes had great flavor, the lamb was just as tender as could be, the onions provided a nice bit of flavor periodically, and the gravy was great (which is interesting coming from me, considering I generally hate gravy).  We will make this often and enjoy it each time.  Thank you for sharing!",

This was easy to prepare and made just enough to have leftovers for lunch the next day. I did the following changes. For the potatoes I used large reds because that was what I happen to have had on hand sliced them 1/4 inch thick with my mandolin and rather then boil I steamed them to make it easier to get the correct consistency without the fear of over cooking. I chopped the bacon before frying then once browned and removed from the pan I proceeded to saute the onions in the bacon fat which I believe added to the flavor of the dish until they were soft. I layed according to the recipe direction then placed the dish in the oven cooking according to the directions and served with a side salad. This recipe is a keeper.",
