Also good on salmon and talapia.  Great as a taco chip dip, or with veggies.  As far as the recipe goes, I followed it except put the roasted red peppers in a glass bowl covered with a lid for about 15 minutes, rather than in a plastic bag (don't care for the idea of the hot peppers in plastic).  I cut the amount of olive oil in half, and still think it could be cut down more.  Other than that, this stuff is fabulous, and everyone who has tried it, from teenagers to adults, LOVES it!!  Try this!!!  It's easy and ssssooooo good!!",
