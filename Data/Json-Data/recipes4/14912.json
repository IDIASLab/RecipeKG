First, please use REAL bacon crumbles, NOT imitation bacon bits. Hormel makes these, as do others. I can't imagine this would be the same with imitation bacon bits. The dry ranch dressing mix adds a great amount of flavor, so don't skip it. However, if you don't have dry ranch dressing mix, you can make your own (below). It makes a large amount, but is great for so many things (on meat, in soups/chili, burritos, etc.) To make it, simply combine and store in an airtight container:\n    1/4 cup dried chives\n    1/4 cup dried parsley\n    1/4 cup dried dill weed\n    2 tablespoons garlic powder\n    2 tablespoons onion powder\n    1 tablespoon salt\n    1 tablespoon ground black pepper\nAnother variation my family enjoys is adding 1/2 cup-1 cup of Velveta Cheese. Also, for clarification, the 10 red potatoes are small-medium sized. If you buy the large ones, that are about the size of the palm of a hand, I would significantly cut back the number.",

VERY GOOD. All the ingredients work together perfectly and there's just enough creaminess and just enough cheese to give it flavor without a lot of fat. Everyone liked this soup, my husband even!",

Here are my modifications: I doubled the recipe, used 3 cups of chicken broth and 3 cups water, added about 6 teaspoons chicken bouillon powder to round out the 'chickeny' flavor, used onion powder instead of onions (onions aren't my favorite), and pan fried the bacon myself (I didn't want to use the store bought bacon bits). About 10 mins after adding the half and half, I also added about 5 oz of the reduced-fat 2% milk Velveeta (per the authors suggestion!) and it turned out AMAZEBALLS! I ladled myself a bowl and garnished it with shredded medium cheddar and sliced green onions. My fianc\u00e9 was walking out the door and I told him (the guy in the profile pic is my fianc\u00e9) to take a taste. His reaction was 'Oh MAN that is delicious. I don't think we'll have any left to share!' Keep in mind I doubled the recipe lol. This dish is a winner, winner, chicken dinner and I will DEFINITELY be making this again!",

I opted to make it completely vegetarian so I left out the bacon and used vegetable Better Than Bouillon (a concentrated paste vs. a bouillon cube). I also added finely diced carrot for color and used one medium shallot instead of red onion. And I didn't have half & half so I replaced it with whole milk. I kept to the spices list exactly and it turned out delicious. I think the recipe is a great base. I can see other vegetables being added or meat variations. Don't be shy to swap the chicken base for vegetable. It really was delicious. I also saw some people mentioning the use of Velveeta. In my opinion, if you are going to make soup from scratch, best to use \"real\" food as much as possible. The traditional cheddar cheese I grated was perfect. Thank you for the recipe.",
