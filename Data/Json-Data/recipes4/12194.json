It isn't clear what to do with the bacon once it is cooked so I diced it up and added to the rice. I didn't drain the tomatoes and the texture turned out perfectly. I think part of the charm is the crunchy bottom and top with a soft middle. Not spicy at all even though I added several splashes of Tobasco to the tomatoe sausage mixture.
