I browned a pound of ground chuck and about two sausage patties in my cast iron dutch oven. There was about 2 tablespoons of grease so I drained that off. Then I layered everything as instructed. In addition to the salt and pepper I sprinkled garlic salt and cayenne pepper between the layers. I cut the bacon into bite-sized pieces and laid it on the top. I put the lid on the dutch oven and baked for 40 minutes removed the lid and baked 20 more and then broiled the top for about 5. What an economical and easy recipe - easy to prepare bake and clean-up!",

Because onions are an absolute no no in this house (I love them the hubby hates them) I have to substitute with onion powder. I added garlic powder onion powder seasoning salt black pepper and some parsley flakes to the dish. Also I didn't layer it I just mixed everything together in our big cast iron fry pan and stuck it in the oven for 40 minutes with the foil on it. I removed the foil and stuck it back in for an additional 40 minutes. It smelled so delicious cooking a definite keeper. I just love this site for recipes!!!! Thank you Kitten!",

I like that it is relatively easy (took a while to chop onions and grate potatoes so next time I'll use frozen hash browns and buy onions already chopped) but if you don't add a bunch of sauces and cheese etc. it's fairly healthy. Kind of like a soup in casserole form. I might try adding some garlic and maybe some tomatoes or tomato paste next time. But overall I liked it. I also had trouble fitting this recipe into an 8x8 pan -- had to cut back to fit it in my pan -- needs a very deep 8x8 or a larger pan for this recipe. Also had trouble getting the bacon done and wound up frying it and putting it back on the casserole. You could skip the bacon if you didn't want to mess with it or wanted to avoid the fat and it would still be tasty. Didn't find it bland at all -- maybe the bland reviews didn't use enough salt?",
