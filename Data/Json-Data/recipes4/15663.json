I used thick and chunky salsa and added some extra onions (what Spanish rice doesn't have onions?). Used a fresh Roma tomato instead of the cup of diced tomatoes.

Next time I'll add some cilantro for personal family preference.",

Susbstituted some of the water with leftover Chicken Broth (1/4 cup) to use it up.   I used medium salsa (1/2 cup), omitted the tomatoes because I used onion and red pepper, and at the recommendation of some, added garlic powder and chili powder - 2 shakes of each.   I will make again and may add a little more of the seasoning because I love extra flavor.  I would give 5 stars but I altered the recipe.",
