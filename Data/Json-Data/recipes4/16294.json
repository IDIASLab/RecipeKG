This recipe is great if you're looking for a make-ahead meal. Pulled pork is great served on fresh baked rolls or pita bread with sharp cheddar cheese and coleslaw. You can serve the pork as is or mix in your favorite BBQ sauce.",

After I shredded the pork I took the juice that it cooked in placed it in a pot and added one large bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Original. I must say that I made 25lbs of pork for a party and that was why I used the large bottle. You can adjust your recipe by taste. It was just enough to add the barbeque flavor to the delicious cooking juices.",
