It gave it an odd consistency that did not sit well with the eggplant.  I would also make my stuffing a little drier, there is a lot of moisture in the eggplant and the stuffing was mushy.  Overall the dish was somewhat soggy. I will try again and eliminate the mayo and make the stuffing a little drier.",
