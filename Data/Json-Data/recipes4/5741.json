The batter was the perfect thickness to produce a fritter that was crunchy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. I used freshly shredded parmesan cheese and I added an extra tablespoon of onion. I also reduced the butter to two tablespoons and used cooking spray (along with the vegetable oil) to try to cut down some of the fat. The recipe seems to be quite versatile. Next time I think I will try adding some garam masala or curry powder and green onions and/or chives.",

This makes a delicious savory fritter that I've served with breakfast lunch and dinner. Also I've found that frying in too much butter and oil makes them greasy.
