I used Sargento reduced fat 4 cheese Mexican shredded cheese, fat free refried beans, and fat free yogurt in the sauce.  I used brown rice, using a little more liquid and extra tomatoes, and whole wheat tortillas to make them even healthier.  Even with these modifications, they were great.  I used uncooked frozen shrimp that I sauteed briefly with the garlic and, as we were putting them together, we decided the salsa was overkill, and skipped it. I would make these for a Mexican themed gathering, without a doubt!",
