I made my own S&S sauce using a recipe online. It was amazing! My husband loved it and told me never to buy from the store again. The recipe is so easy - Combine 1/3 c. rice vinegar, 4 Tbsp brown sugar, 1 Tbsp ketchup, and 1 tsp soy sauce in small saucepan and bring to boil. Mix 2 tsp cornstarch with 4 teaspoons water and stir into boiling sauce mixture to thicken. Makes 1/2 cup sauce and was enough to coat the veggies and sausage. Delish!",

I kept it warm in a crock pot and served rice on the side - it was gone before anything else on the table. Again, the pineapple were a hot commodity.",

I didn't add any hot spice because I used a cajun-spiced smoked sausage. Really easy to make. Just my style of cooking. I disagree with this fat content rating. Is it the sweet and sour? Other similar recipes here using smoked sausage have less than half the fat of this. As an aside I took a taste of this before adding the s&s - delicious on it's own!",
