Ib added red crushed peppers and used 2/3 cup orange juice, 1/3 cup lime juice and added enough chicken broth to cover the meat. I also patted the Meat with the seasonings first then seared one side for a minute before adding the veggies and liquids. The quick sear locked the spices onto the meat and gave it a gorgeous brown color when done simmering. I then fried the meat in olive oil and used it in tacos - SO INCREADIBLE!!! Just top the tacos with diced onion and cilantro, then guacamole and lime juice. Oh I also added Adobo seasoning to the list of seasoning and to the shreaded meatv just before frying it. Enjoy!!!",

Only prob with this recipe was lack of flavor in the pork. I will still make again with a lil alterations next time.",

I usually add about 1T chili powder salt and pepper to taste and about 1/4 t cayenne (we like it spicy). It is ready for burritos. I also make extra and separate some of the meat for tacos. For tacos it is best to put the cooked meat with the after-added seasoning in the oven 325 degrees for about 15 minutes just to get the extra fat and juices off since you will be frying the meat in the taco shell anyway and the extra moisture gets the tortilla too soggy (even if you don't fry). It will store cooked for about 3 days in the fridge.",

I cut the meat in chunks and fried it in a little butter and oil to get that characteristic carnitas texture.  I drained the veggies and poured the juice in the frying pan with the meat and let it reduce.  We ate this in corn tortillas.  The hubby thought he'd died and gone to heaven.  He suggested that it would make a great smothered burrito filling if I didn't fry it.  So we pureed the remaining veggies with some broth, added a little salsa picante (Tapatio,) and made a sauce.  Had smothered burritos the next day for lunch- it was delicious!  Next time I'll pull the carrots out before I puree.",
