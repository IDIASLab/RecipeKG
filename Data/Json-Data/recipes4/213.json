I left the peanuts whole and mixed them with the chocolate sauce on top. I let my sauce cool to room temperature before pouring it on the ice cream but it melted the ice cream a litte and I had little \"marshmallow\" looking spots in the chocolate where the ice cream floated up to the top. Maybe the sauce could be refrigerated a while before pouring on the ice cream. I personally thought this was just average (a 3 star recipe) but others loved it so I gave it 4 stars.",
