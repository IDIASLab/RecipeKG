But... the green chili sauce in this recipe makes these amazing! I don't think I'll ever eat another breakfast burrito without it. I did change the recipe a little bit. I could not find frozen Hatch, New Mexico green chili peppers so I used canned diced and roasted green chilies, since I was using canned I used 2 7oz cans to make sure I got a lot of the green chili flavor. Also instead of using vegetable oil to fry the potatoes in I used the bacon grease (why let all that flavor go?). My potatoes must have been really big because I had way to many after shredding them. I think 2-3 would have been perfect. Thanks for the recipe I will be making this again!",

When simmering the chile, make sure to not let the peppers simmer for too long, they can begin to lose their flavor as they're already roasted/cooked beforehand. Also, if you can find it - use the FROZEN hatch green chile. \n\nOkay. So I'm kind of nervous to say this, as there may be several New Mexicans lurking about... BUT - I do hate green chile. Yes, I am a resident of New Mexico. Born and raised. This was the first time I've EVER liked green chile. I used mild because I don't like my chile to overwhelm the taste of the dish, but I still want a little \"kick.\" I could walk across the street and pay $5 for this burrito at a taco truck, but it tasted 200x better while relaxing in my pj's and chowing down on this baby. THANK YOU \"applejedi1,\" for this outstanding recipe. Now, if only I could eat one everyday without increasing my chances of that heart attack ;)",
