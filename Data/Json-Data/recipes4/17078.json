Sweetness of cranberries mild crunch of apple firm crunch of almonds and the flavor of the Balsamic vinegar swirled in amongst the various textures and flavors to create a warm salad. Fairly easy to whip up. I used a bit more and quartered my Brussel Sprouts because they were small. Used an apple I had on hand roughly chopped whole almonds and used a Balsamic vinegar \"to taste\". I also used about 1T. of bacon fat to really heat things up for the last couple of minutes. Could be served as a side salad but we had this as a main entree. Keeping the recipe in my files and think I will be making this again soon.",
