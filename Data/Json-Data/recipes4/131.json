Also, I use bread and butter pickles sometimes instead of the sweet pickle relish and it gives it an extra good taste.  Bear in mind, the more ketchup you use, the sweeter it will be as ketchup contains more sugar than most people realize.  I suggest adding a little bit of ketchup at a time tasting as you go.
