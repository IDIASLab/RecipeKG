I do however do a few things different: - I use about a cup of milk instead of cream cheese - I add at least 2 cups of sliced fresh mushrooms (cooked with the ground beef) - I use plenty of seasonings while cooking the beef ( garlic powder seasoning salt a little rosemary black pepper - all to taste) - and I use several different types of pasta. Sometimes I use spaghetti sometimes penne scoobidoos rotini etc - depending on what we feel like. They are all wonderful. This is one of our family favorites!",

I usually use whole wheat pasta for a healthier meal for your family and it's still delicious. If your family loves mushrooms you've got to add it to the recipe makes it even better!",

The only difference is that she put diced onion and frozen whole kernel corn in it also (I use half a 1 lb. bag). She used medium-sized egg noodles for the pasta. It does add a few more minutes to the meal but I saute half a sweet onion and one clove of garlic after I brown my ground beef and drain off the fat. I season the beef well while it is cooking (I use Tony's) but any type of seasoning is good. I use only one can of cream of mushroom soup and wisk it together with the cream cheese and one soup can of milk. Then throw it all together back in the skillet and let simmer for a few minutes. I was so glad she taught this to me. I make a meal of it with a salad and some good rolls.",
