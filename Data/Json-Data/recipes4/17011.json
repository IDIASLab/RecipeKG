The one thing I did not like was the way the recipe instructs you to cut the potatoes. I found that trying to fry/flip them was more difficult to do with them so long. It would have been easier if they would have been cut width wise. No biggie but I will definitely do that next time. Don't forget to lightly salt them once they come out of the oil.",
