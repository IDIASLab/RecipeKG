Instead of dirtying another dish to saute the tempeh, I threw it on an empty spot on the baking tray and baked it. The key to roasting vegetables is to spread them out rather than piling them up, which will steam instead of roast. I used two baking trays since I had doubled a few ingredients and swapped out the veges that were done, as necessary.",

I admit I didn\u2019t watch the times while roasting the veggies. I did add them separately and kept them separate. I just kept my eye on them and added them in the order written when it just seemed the right time. I typically go to great lengths to avoid cooked fennel, but this was really tasty. The dressing is scrumptious. I used Raghavan\u2019s Curry Blend, which is pretty spicy. What a great recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us.",
