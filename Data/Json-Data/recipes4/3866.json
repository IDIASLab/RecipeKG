I also used a red/black pepper blend in the flour which gave it extra flavor. I used a whole chicken cut up and fried my pieces in my electric skillet and then transferrred them to a hot oven 350-375 to finish cooking. I also brined the chicken pieces in an ice water/salt bath (so they would bleed) for about 40 minutes before putting them in buttermilk - because of the salt water bath I omitted all salt. Will definitely be making this again! Thank you.",

I omitted the hot pepper sauce and used 1/2 tsp of cayenne for the buttermilk mixture and 1 tsp of cayenne for the flour mixture because I didn't want it to be too spicy for my kids. UPDATED: I have easily made this 50 times and I have a few tips. -If you want to decrease the cayenne don't omit the cayenne in the buttermilk. It gives it an awesome flavor. -I use chicken breasts cut into strips -put chicken with buttermilk/cayenne in a large ziplock back and the put in fridge -mix flour mixture in another bag -dip between bags using 2 forks (trust me...) -Double dip. Always double dip. It makes them really crispy. Dip in flour then buttermilk then back in flour. Then in the oil. -put a cookie rack on a sheet pan covered in paper towels. Put chicken on there after cooking. Keeps them from getting soggy. This is our family go to.",
