I used chicken breasts, instead of thighs, and increased the olive oil to 3 Tbls.  I also seasoned the chicken liberally (before browning in oil) with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I also cooked the onions much longer than the recipe stated (about 13 minutes) because I like to get my onions really carmalized and bring out their flavor-be careful not to burn them!  I served the chicken with oven roasted potatoes as suggested (I used yukon gold potatoes, quarted them, and tossed them with olive oil, cumin, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika-baked at 475 degrees for 20 minutes) and I did toss the potatoes with the onion mixture.  Very, very simple and it tastes out of this world!  Do not be fooled by it's simplicity, and do not hesitate to add your own spices as this recipe is a wonderful base that can be adjusted to suit any palate.  A +++++",

It is delicious and a huge hit even with my 2 very picky children (5 & 13). Couple of tips: season the chicken with salt pepper and a little paprika before you saute use a very large onion (my favorite part of this recipe is the sauce) and use chicken stock instead of the water. Serve it over rice with some extra sauce...yum! I've tried doubling the sauce recipe and it doesn't come out as good. So I've started doubling the entire recipe using 2 pans boneless breasts in one and thighs in the other. (I start the thighs first since they take longer to cook.) Great recipe...simple but delicious!",
