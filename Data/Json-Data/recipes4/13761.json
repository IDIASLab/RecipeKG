Instead of using one cup of water, I substituted one cup of (no sodium chicken) broth. I tossed the potato cubes/slices with seasoning and EVOO. I used skinless thighs for this and reckon the meat would have been a lot better with skin-on thighs that were marinated in the oil mixture. After the chicken was done, I covered it with potatoes, scooped juice over the pile and then sprinkled with Parmesan. I let that cook for another 5 minutes and then broiled between 5-10 minutes. Again, because I used skinless thighs on my first attempt, the potatoes were the star of the meal. However, I will make this again and use skin-on thighs. Thanks for sharing!!!",

Season the chicken w/ Lawry's seasoned salt garlic powder onion powder and pepper. I cut the water by 1/2 added minced garlic and oregano to evoo mixture. Sprinkled additional Lawry's over entire dish. Covered w/ alum foil for the remaining 20 mins of cooking which allowed the potatoes to cook through. Removed the alum foil and broiled on high for 8 minutes to crisp the skin of chicken. This dish was a winner!! Check out the completed custom recipe on my channel.

I made this for company and one of our guests said \"you need to add this to your repeating recipes list.\"  I thought that was good compliment! I made some changes that other reviewers suggested.  I put the potatoes and large slices of onion in a bowl with the olive oil and seasoning (s+p, rosemary, thyme and garlic salt), and rolled it around to cover the vegetables.  Then in the baking dish I put chicken broth and my chicken (I used bone in split chicken breasts cause that is what I had). I put some salt, pepper and a touch of cayenne on the chicken directly, then placed the potatoes and onions covered in the rosemary/thyme mix around the chicken. I also added a few whole garlic cloves for a little extra something.  I cooked it uncovered, then added foil over top for the last 20 mins.  Once it was done I took off the foil, added shredded parmesan  and baked for another 5 mins.  All that to say, there were no leftovers.",
