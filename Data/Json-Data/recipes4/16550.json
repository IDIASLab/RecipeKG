I made fresh lasagna sheets, and aside from this basic change followed the recipe. I think what might help this recipe would be a blend of beef and Italian sausage. Next, because water gives no depth to the sauce a nice Cabernet Sauvignon would be a great replacement. Instead of seasoning the beef,  season the tomato sauce mixture...prepared the day before would let the flavoring meld. Then pour it into the cooked beef mixture. These small changes would likely take it from ordinary to marvelous!",
