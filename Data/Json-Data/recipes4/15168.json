The recipe should warn cooks who are unaccustomed to using store bought wrappers that they should follow the directions on the back of the package first in order to soften them. Since I was not warned, I followed the recipe exactly without looking for additional instructions on the packaging which resulted in malformed, leaky triangles. I think I\u2019d like to try this again some day since the filling was very tasty, but I\u2019ll have to play around with the initial prep to see where the recipe itself was lacking.",
