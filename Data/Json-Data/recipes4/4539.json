One of the best things I've eaten in a long time. I wonder if I could use a cheap cut of meat (like a combo of sausage and stew meat?) and have it come out tender and awesome even though I cheaped out. I bet I could. NOTE: I apparently did not read the recipe all the way through and I made this on the stovetop. I browned my meat then the vegetables combined them and added the rest of the ingredients excluding the cream. I cooked this covered and vented for about an hour and a half then added the cream. Even though I did not follow the recipe exact (I was far too distracted and busy for that today to be honest) this still turned out spectacularly. Even my kids slurped it up! I'm SO making this again. And again.;)",
