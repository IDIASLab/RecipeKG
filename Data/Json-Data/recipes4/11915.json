I have found that peanuts believe it or not make a great subsitution in a pinch for the pine nuts... If it seems dry also add a few tbsp butter.. and or vegetable oil... Enjoy!",

I have never combined chicken and ground beef before it is a good way to use up small amounts of both. Maybe adding some red peppers could zip it up a little.

The only other change I made was to brown the meat and then drain off the fat. I waited to add the butter until after the meat was drained. I did this because I don't normally use fat to brown ground beef and because others mentioned this dish can be dry. My dish turned out moist but needed a little more spice for my taste. I added an additional half tsp. allspice and a 1/4 tsp. more of cinnamon. That did the trick. Thanks for sharing this beloved dish.",
