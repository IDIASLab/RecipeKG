We like to add a few dashes of Sriracha&reg; or fresh chopped jalapeno and onion to make up for the missing heat. The kids are partial to goldfish crackers on top! But as with any chili, feel free to top it with your favorites. If you are lucky enough to live near an Italian market, the salsiccia is best in our opinion. If not, then you can sub another kind of ground Italian sausage. It may be light on spice, but full of flavor!",

                "reviewBody": "This chili is very interesting. The chocolate flavor is pretty strong. I felt like between it and the coffee it made it a little bitter. I had to add some brown sugar to offset the bitterness. Once I did that my 6 year-old liked it. I used tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes and mild sausage instead of the one listed. Also I just used diced green peppers instead of roasting them. Also the amount of chili powder was a bit much for what my kid can handle so I cut that in half. As written I'm not sure this chili is very kid friendly with the bitter chocolate coffee and amount of chili powder. This recipe has definitely given me some ideas for future chilis though.",

Just used the beef - and not sirloin (too expensive). I only used a sprinkle of cumin and sprinkle of chili powder (1/4 of each really sounded like a lot?). I did not broil the peppers I just diced and cooked them with the onions and garlic. Kids loved it. Will make it again.",
