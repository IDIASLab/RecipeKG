My problem was the meat didn't quite get the chance to cook long enough to be tender. It wasn't terribly chewy but not quite the way the way I like it to turn out. Will make this again however, if I can figure out a way around that one small chewy problem.",

I DID sub one cup water with a cup merlot. Makes all the diff in the WORLD.  Coudlnt even tell you the measurments...but seasoned the flour for the meat with garlic salt and lemon pepper, then let the butter and oil simmer for a bit with Safron, Thyme, Rosemary (my fave) and a Ginger Seasame seasoning. It was an absolute throw together that doesnt even really belong on this board...but thought the OP deserved the post because she gave me the idea to begin with, but my family loved it so  much-they request it TOO often.  It has now become a Hill family traditional thing that only I can make because I NEVER DO right it down! HA. I give BIG PROPS to the OP because although I didnt follow the original recipie by any stretch of the imagination, I would have never thought to use the stew meat in this fashion w/ the rice! I've done this with stew meat with noodles hundreds of times.  Funny how our minds get stuck in a rut and thats where they follow....guess thats why Im not on Food Network. HA.  I STILL THINK PIE STYLE SHOULD HAVE WON AND PAULA SHOULDNT HAVE BEEN FIRED! THAT WAS SOME DIRTY WORK THERE!!!!",
