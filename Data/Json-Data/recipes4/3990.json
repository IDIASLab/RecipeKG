I also added a bit of crushed red pepper flake to the cheese mixture and meat. After the meat was cooked I sauted some veggies too and threw those is. I used onion red and yellow pepper and zuchini. I also used a little more sauce and added some basil and oregano. Very tasty and we will have leftovers for a week! Which I love.",

I made a small change because I hate when people completely change a recipie and then rate it. I added some italian herb season to the turkey as I cooked it. Only becuase I'm not a fan of plain ground turkey. Everything else the same and it was so good. The only problem I had is that it did not heat through enough. Next time I will crank the heat up to 350 and cook for 35-40 minutes. Also definitely cover with foil. Ours was a little dry on top.",

I added some more flavor by adding garlic crushed red pepper oregano basil and rosemary to the turkey while cooking and I used an entire jar of sauce even though I halved the recipe. (What can I say? I LOVE tomato sauce!). I didn't have ricotta so I just left it out and I added broccoli to the cheese mixture to up the veggie count. Turned out excellent. Very nice very flavorful. Turkey doesn't always have much of a flavor so I'm always spicing it up. I made this up and refrigerated the night before so instead of the oven on 300 for 30 minutes I upped the temp to 350 and the time to 50 minutes so it would heat through and melt the cheese. I don't think this would have been necessary if I'd made the entire thing the same day. Thanks for the recipe!",
