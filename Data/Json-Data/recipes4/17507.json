Congee is a Chinese rice porridge traditionally eaten for breakfast or brunch, but I personally eat it any time. It is also very good for digestion and has excellent health benefits. Although I've been having congee since I was a baby, it remains for me the ultimate comfort food.",

It differs slightly from the recipe that I make by using short grain rice. I use 1 cup of long grain jasmine rice and 1/2 cup of sticky rice. I gave this recipe 5 stars because the authenticity and taste were there. Thanks for your recipe.",
