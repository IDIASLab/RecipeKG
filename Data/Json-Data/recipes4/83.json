Discarded marinade and baked for 25 minutes in a foil lined (for EASY cleanup!) 13x9 inch pan @ 375 degrees. The sauce in the pan was wonderful served over rice. If you need or want more sauce just mix equal parts of the Pace and Zesty. I look forward to serving this no-fail easy dish for company.",
