I would only suggest that you make sure you get your meat balls good and brown, even to the point of being crusty on the outside, because when they marinate and then cook they will get soft.  Some of mine began falling apart as I stired while cooking, I think because they were not browned long enough.  I also cut the amount of whiskey in half ~ I've never tried it with the full amount of whiskey, so I'm not saying that the full amount is bad.  The recipe suggests cooking for at least a half hour, but I suggest you cook them much longer than that.  At the 30 minute point we didn't like them at all, and my husband and I considered throwing them out, but after they cooked for a couple of hours they really became quite good.  I will certainly make this recipe again!!",

Second double the marinade or it won't even cover the balls as you marinate them. Third medium heat is too high. Cook on low or you'll burn them. Finally you might want to add some oil to the pan before you begin frying. It will prevent the balls from falling apart when you need to turn them.",
