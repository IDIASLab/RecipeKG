I'm glad I decided to try this as I usually avoid recipes without many reviews. I was surprised by how quickly the wine evaporated after I added it. Maybe my burner temperature was too high but the wine was gone after about 5 minutes - there was no sauce to speak of. I continued cooking for the full 15 minutes. Luckily the meatballs were moist and had great flavor even without the sauce. The only complaint we had was that they were a hair too salty. I will make these again with less salt and try cooking at a lower temperature.",
