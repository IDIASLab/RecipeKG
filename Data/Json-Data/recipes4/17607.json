                "reviewBody": "This has replaced the Thanksgiving pumpkin pie in our house and is so much better. I find the traditional pumpkin pie too dense and sweet. To be fair if you look at a can of pumpkin it s actually more squash anyway. This is so much lighter in texture and not overly sweet. To put the portions in perspective 1/2 this recipe with 3 cups of cushaw pur\u00e9e and you get 2 pies. I took a couple of tips from another cushaw pie recipe which said to roast the cushaw for an hour in a 350 oven and then peel off the skin. Either way cushaw holds a lot of liquid so cook the day ahead and put in a colander over a catch bowl to drain the water. Even with this I still squeezed excess water out with a dish towel. I recommend this so the pie isn t too watery. I did add a bit of white sugar (just a couple of tablespoons) for a bit more sweetness but also a bit of lemon extract too. Added a dollop of fresh whip cream when served.",
