A couple things I do to make this easier are, run the cauliflower through my food processor and then put it in a microwave safe bowl, cover with plastic wrap and zap it for about 8-10 minutes and let it sit for a couple minutes to steam through. Then I mix all the above ingredients, I substitute plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream for less fat, and bake as directed. Comes out great every time.",
