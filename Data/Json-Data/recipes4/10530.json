But the next day the leftovers were so delicious that I had to change the rating to a 4. To sear the breasts so they are juicy I used peanut oil with 2 tbspns butter to keep the flavor. I constantly nudged the pieces so the almond crumbs didn't fall off and cooked on high for 2 minutes each side. The butter/oil mix from recipe will just burn on high heat. The egg wash was really watery I used 1/4 cup water with 2 eggs I added 3 or 4 big coves of garlic and some salt to the mushroom/onion mix. I highly recommend adding dry red wine or liquor to the cream sauce as well as 1/4 tspn salt. The grit of the chopped almonds bothered me so next time I'd try putting some almond extract in the egg wash lightly flour the breasts then top the dish with toasted almond slivers upon serving. I served with chopped cauliflower and carrots sauteed in olive oil and garlic. My husband gives this recipe a 5.",
