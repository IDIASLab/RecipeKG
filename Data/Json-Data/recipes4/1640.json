They have a very cheesy flavor the ground toasted pecans along with the cayenne kick the flavor up a notch.Because of the stiffness of the mix I prepare a half batch at a time otherwise it kills your hands and arms trying to knead the mix. My friends love the little cheese crackers and buy them by the truckloads. I had them over for a little cocktail do and surprised them with these crackers. They raved about these so much that I finally had to take them into the kitchen and make up some logs to send home with them.I put 1/2t of garlic powder and I used Extra Sharp Premium Label Tillamook Cheddar cheese. I ground my pecans so the dough wouldn't pull apart when cutting. I cut them 1/8th inch thick and baked them for 15 minutes for a crispy crunchy texture. I did a batch 1/4 in and baked for 12 minutes. When they cooled they crushed in your mouth rather than exploding with crispiness.You decide what texture you want then cut and bake accordingly.I can't say enough wonderful things about these crackers. I might be inclined to leave out the extra salt because the Cheddar is very salty and the cayenne adds to the feeling of saltiness. These are great! Thanks so much for sharing!",
