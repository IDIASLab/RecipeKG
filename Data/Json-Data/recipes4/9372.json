It turned out wonderful and my family loved it.  I did use the strawberry flavoring, but I used about 1/2 tsp more.  I then added an 1/8 cup of strawberry jam.  (Next time I'll use a little more because my family LOVED the small strawberry pieces in the cake.)  The chocolate cake batter DEFINITELY lacked chocolate flavor, so I added an 1/8 cup of Dutch cocoa and 6 tablespoons of melted bittersweet chocolate.  (You could probably use semi-sweet.)  I was NOT pleased with the taste of the frosting...it tasted more like confectioners sugar instead of chocolate.  So, I added cocoa powder, a little melted bittersweet chocolate, 1/2 tsp of vanilla and enough milk to make it \"drizzable.\"  Turned out deliciously.  Upon cutting the cake, we found perfectly marbled layers and will definitely make this cake again AND serve it with neapolitan ice cream!!",

And I did have to bake it about 10 minutes longer. When it was sliced I thought there would be 3 distinct layers of vanilla chocolate and strawberry but was pleasantly surprised at the beautiful swirl pattern. Instead of pouring the batter I spooned all 3 layers into the pan. Everyone at work thought the cake was yummy and asked for the recipe. One of the ladies at work made it for a church supper and said there was none left to take back home everyone loved it. Highly recommend this recipe. It would make a lovely presentation served with sliced neopolitan ice cream!",
