What's left after the marinating doesn't go far when using over rice. I'm not sure about everyone else but I had to strain my sauce after boiling for a little bit because the gross chicken juice/protein/whatever turned to scum and I had to get it off to make an edible sauce. To make this really great it needs some spice. Add some hot pepper flakes or cut back on the maple syrup it was just too sweet for me.",

This makes a very nice amount of sauce for you sauce fans. I cut down on the amount of water by 1/4 as I didn't intend to boil it down as the recipe called for. This is a nice easy teriyaki and the maple syrup is a perfect sweet flavoring for it.",
