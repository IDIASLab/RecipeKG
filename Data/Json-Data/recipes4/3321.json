I only used one egg, extra cheese, and extra Ritz crackers to mix into the casserole as well as top. I did this because I had read in previous reviews that it was runny. I also used two, large, fresh broccoli crowns instead of frozen.  It was so delicious and not runny at all! EVERYONE raved about it and it was the only dish that was completely gone.",

I did change it up a bit. I used 2 16oz packages of broccoli & cauliflower blend since that is what I had on hand. I used cream of celery soup since I don't like cream of mushroom and I also omitted the onion since I don't like onion. I forgot to add the eggs, but it didn't need them. I made this years ago for a holiday dinner and everyone loved it. I would definately eat this over green bean casserole!  ** I made this a second time as the recipe stated and I would definately suggest leaving out the eggs! It had a weird scrambled egg consistency and I much preferred the casserole without the eggs.",

I crushed up one sleeve of Ritz crackers mixed about 1/4 cup into the casserole (to thicken as others said it can be a bit soupy) and spread the remaining 3/4 cup over the top. I used a 9x13 casserole dish and cooked it for 40 minutes at 350 (to soften the onions - they were still a little crunchy after 30 minutes). It was delicious and it got great reviews from my family (young and old)!! I think I will try this again as the recipe is written (only 1/2 stick of butter though - 1 just seems like too much!) - will update my review if I do.",
