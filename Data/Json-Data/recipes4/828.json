If the breading is still falling off make sure that when you pull the chicken from the hot sauce that you make sure it isn't dripping wet. Let it quit dripping if you have to. Then make sure the flour mixture coats the chicken very well. Oher than that, I don't know why the breading would fall off. next time you make it and kids have some, try cutting them up into strips. That's the way I have made them from day one. And I always marinate them overnight. The longer the better. Thanks for trying the recipe.",

I marinated them 4 hours in a baggie with hot sauce, some cayenne pepper, season all salt and garlic powder.\nFor the coating I made an egg wash with 2 eggs, half a cup of milk and a splash of hot sauce.  In another bowl I mixed flour, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper. I cut the chicken in strips and coated them with flour, dipped them in egg wash next then flour again.\nIn a frying pan I heated oil then fried them.  They were fabulous.  Will definitely be on my Fall list for football season finger food.",

They did cook faster and absorbed more marinade than the drumsticks did. I also added garlic powder about 1/4 cup white vinegar and cayenne pepper to the marinade (my hubby likes things spicy). Ran low on coating mixture towards the end and thought I had ruined the last batch but it turned out great regardless. Have made several times and intend to continue!",
