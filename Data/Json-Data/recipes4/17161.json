I I also sprayed the extra large muffin tins that I used with cooking spray first and may have used a bit less oil as I didn't really measure the olive oil but eye balled it.   Rose really high and was light and fluffy.  Just what I was looking for!",

I used a popover pan, and next time I will increase the amount of batter in each cup from 1/4 to 1/3 so I end up with 6 very high puddings instead of 8 smaller. I would think that 1/4 cup batter would work perfectly in a muffin pan, but if you want that hi-rise, somewhat dramatic look, you'll need a little more batter if using a popover pan.  There was a lot of olive oil sitting in the bottom of each popover cup after the puddings were baked, so I'll try 1/2 tsp oil in the future.  I was concerned that if I microwaved the batter for a minute, I'd end up with scrambled eggs, so I micro'd it for 30 seconds, put the lid on the bowl, and then set in the sun for about 15 minutes which gave me warm batter. These were really, really simple to make, and tasted great!",
