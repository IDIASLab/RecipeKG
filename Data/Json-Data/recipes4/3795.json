I placed the fish in baking dish lined with slightly greased al foil. Instead of blue cheese, I used chedder which I think it's a mistake as the flavor was not strong enough. Next time will use blue cheese or feta cheese. Also, I will add 1/2 more tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to the onion and red pepper although I think for most people, 2 tablespoon should be enough. I baked the fish at 400 for 15 minutes and for the first time, I received compliments from husband on tilapia!",
