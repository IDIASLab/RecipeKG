I leave the tomato paste out because I use this broth in place of store bought broth in all my recipes. \n\nHere's another trick. All those pieces and peels of veggies you have when you cook...keep a container in the freezer. Toss the remnants in the container. Every month. Cook yourself up more bone broth. I do mine in a slow cooker for at least 24 hours. The longer it cooks the more concentrated the flavor. Stay away from using cruciferous veggies in the pot. They can leave a weird after taste. Use everything else. I add dried or fresh herbs towards the end. Dried mushrooms and a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar for brightness. Totally optional. I let the mixture cool, strain to get the bits out, and then pour into quart or pint mason jars and freeze. Leave about an inch of space between the broth and the jar lid. They keep in the freezer for 6 months. Again, use in place of store bought stock. It is so worth it. Easy clean up with a slow cooker liner. \n\nYou can make it in a stock pot on the stove or in the oven. Low and slow is best. Pressure cooker if you're in a hurry.\n\nAdd more water if necessary to keep everything surged if you are cooking on the stove, slow cooker, or oven.",

I have read recently that adding about 1/4 cup vinegar to the water and letting the bones sit in it for about half hour before turning on the heat help leach more minerals out of the bones so I always do this now with all my broth.  Always have homemade broth in the freezer, so handy and much cheaper , tastier and healthier than store bought!  Love drinking on it's own, esp during the winter",

The bones were fatty, so the tomato paste sort of slid around.  I was unable to coat the bones, but I clumped the paste  on the bones and it did just fine.  I cooked it in the crock pot less than the 24 hours(about 18), because I was tired of the house smelling like beef soup.  After straining, I had 5 cups of very dark broth (the color of black coffee), which I used in Chef John's American onion soup recipe.  Will make this again.",
