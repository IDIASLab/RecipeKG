I love rice, especially Jasmine and Basmati, but can never get it just right on the stove, and don't always feel like getting the rice cooker out. This is perfect! Just dump everything in, and that's it! Instead of doing the water mixture on the stove, I just put it all in my baking dish (minus the rice) and stuck it in the microwave til everything was melted and mixed together. I then dumped the rice in and stuck it in the oven. That saved having to wash a pot. After 25 minutes of baking, I gave it all a stir and noticed that the rice on the bottom was a bit soggy, so I mixed it up so that rice was on the top and stuck it back in the oven to dry out a bit. I ended up cooking it for about 27-28 minutes and it was perfect and fluffy.  The only thing I might change next time is to use less butter, maybe half the amount, but otherwise this is a keeper!",

I usually use chicken broth and that's it, no butter and no salt since the chicken broth has salt.  Definitely no vinegar, I don't see any need for it.  I make brown rice at 400 for about an hour.  Jasmine about half the time at 375.  Liquid ratio depends on how dry or how moist you like your rice.  The standard ratio for most rice is 2 parts liquid to 1 part rice but add slightly less liquid if you want it dryer.  The best pots to use for oven baked rice are the Le Creuset dutch ovens.",

First time I made it I used the recipe as written, the only alteration was I tripled the quantity, and used a larger, half hotel pan.  It took forever to get done, and was way too buttery for my taste.  Second time I made these alterations: I used parboiled white rice.  I increased the oven temperature to 375.  I cut the butter quantity in half, and didn't butter the casserole ahead of time.  I used vegetable broth instead of water. I left out the vinegar as I didn't think it added anything to the finished product. Before cooking I rinsed the rice with cold water to remove excess starch.  I reduced the amount of water to  1 3/4 cup for 1 cup uncooked rice.  And I planned on it taking 45 minutes to cook.  Which it did.  And it tasted better.",

I used coconut oil in place of the butter. I also added chopped colorful mini peppers and green onions. I set the oven on 350, assembled as directed, added the peppers and onions and covered the baking dish. I baked for 30 minutes, removed cover and baked for 15 minutes more. I stirred about halfway through the last 15 minutes. After removing the dish from the oven I let it stand for about 20 minutes before stirring. The coconut flavor is faint but a nice addition. For a great baked brown rice recipe try Alton Browns.",

The rice was a bit greasy and it didn't taste the way I want my rice to taste.  It is not suitable for serving with Chinese food, and I would never attempt to use it for fried rice.  Disappointing.  I should have followed my instincts when I first read the recipe; reduce the butter, heat the oven to 400 and cook for about an hour,",
