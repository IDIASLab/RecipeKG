Diced up 2 granny smith apples with twice the kraut and and used all apple juice; cooked all for 20 minutes in pressure cooker.  The meat was very tender and could be shredded into the kraut.  Boiled separately creamer potatoes and added to mixture.  Guess I made it more of a stew. This was so good, and even better the next day!",

I was concerned that using more meat than the submitter suggested might result in under-cooking.  I wish!  My lovely 2 pounds of pork tenderloin was overcooked at 15 minutes.  And this is with 2 pounds of kraut, also more than suggested.  As  I said, this was tasty, but I'm going to stop the first cook at 8 minutes, next time.  I did not have fennel, and I added salt and pepper prior to searing.  I also used all juice, no water.",
