A trick I use is to dip my apple in the caramel then drizzle it with the dark and white chocolates. I let that set for a few minutes while I dip several apples. I let them set up on a cookie cooling rack with a cookie pan (covered in foil) underneath to catch the drippings. Then I re dip just the bottoms of the apples in the caramel and then cookie crumbs. It gives a great presentation and looks very pretty when wrapped in clear cellophane tied with a ribbon or raffia. Update... I also wanted to mention That the apples are usually dipped in boiling water for a few seconds to remove the wax right? Well since I make these every year I do something a little different to remove the wax now. I open a new \"Scotch\" scrub sponge and scrub the apple under hot running water. Apples dropped in the boiling water tend to discolor a little. The taste isn't altered but I just didn't like that discoloration. The scrub sponge works great!!",
