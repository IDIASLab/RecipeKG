Genorously season chops with salt pepper garlic powder and onion powder then brown in small amount of oil on each side. place chops over the top of the potatoes in slow cooker. Before mixing the water with the soup pour water into the pan that the chops were browned in. I used about 1/2 C water. Heat water in pan and scpape up all the brown bits mixing with water. Then mix this with the soup and pour over the chops. This makes for much more flavor than plain water. Cook on high for 2 to 3 hours. Yummy and not at all bland.",

I put the pork in my large crockpot with the soup and used beef broth instead of water. Cooked on low for 4 hours and then added the potatoes and cooked another 2 hours added the green beans and cooked another hour. It was well done and the pork was so tender. Lots of leftovers which I think I'll used to make a pork vegetable stew with. Such an easy one pot recipe! I always spray my crockpot with cooking spray so cleanup is a breeze.",

Then I seasoned them very well with garlic black pepper and seasoned salt. I placed unpeeled sliced red potatoes in the bottom of the slow cooker and put the chops on top. Then I poured the soup into the skillet and added milk instead of water. I scraped up all of the browned bits in the skillet with the soup and milk in it and after covering the chops with sliced onion I poured the soup mixture on top. I didn't add green beans to the cooker but instead steamed them and served them on the side. My daughter who isn't crazy about any kind of meat loved the chops. My husband liked them too. They were very tender but didn't fall apart...maybe because of the egg and flour coating? On busy school nights it's a perfect quick meal.",

I did make a few changes based on previous reviewers' recommendations. I used 2 cans of cream of mush soup 6 potatoes onion and garlic powder. I diced my potatoes and put 1/3 in the bottom of slow cooker then sprinkled with salt and pepper. Covered with 1 can soup/water mixture. Then placed my previously pan browned chops (1/2 of them) and covered with another 1/3 of potatoes then remainder of chops and remainder of potatoes and lastly covered with soup/water mixture. I seasoned each layer of potatoes with salt and pepper and the chops were seasoned with salt onion & garlic powder. I then cooked on low for 8 hours. Very tasty. My husband couldn't wait to eat the leftovers the next day! Thanks for a great recipe. This is my first review and I hope it is helpful!",

I seasoned them with salt pepper and onion powder first. Someone else said they used beef broth instead of water to deglaze the pan but I didn't have any. I did find a can of french onion soup that I will probably never use and used the broth from that. I then mixed the cream of mushroom soup right into the pan. It got really nice and brown! I added thick potato slices and seasoned between layers. I cooked the green beans separately for my picky kids. The meat was tender and I thought the sauce was delicious and not too canned tasting.",
