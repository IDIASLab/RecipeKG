Here's how to take a 4 star & make it 5 star: (1) use 1/2 c. low sodium chicken broth; (2) sub Ponzu (seasoned soy sauce) for soy sauce. Ponzu had 400mg sodium / svg lite tarmari has 700 mg sodium and regular soy sauce has 900 mg sodium. That's it. Has a GREAT flavor pork chops shredded apart and are neighbors at the condo wanted to know what smelled so good. We served over Jasmine rice with stir fried mixed veggies. The \"zucchini and onion stir fry\" recipe from this site is really good with this too. Thanks for sharing. We had to find the Korean chile paste at a local Asian market since Whole Foods Earthfare and local Ingles didn't have it but it was worth the hunt to get it!",
