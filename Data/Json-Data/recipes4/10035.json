I thought the addition of cumin was strange from the get-go and I was right. Cumin is NOT a scandinavian spice. If you want authentic Limpa leave out the cumin and add anise instead. I found a better recipe that used brown sugar molassas caraway anise fennel and orange juice. That one came out perfect.",
