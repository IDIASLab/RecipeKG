I had whole (not pitted) green olives and shaved about 20 of them. I figured they would flavor it more due to the cut up pieces so I did not add salt. As it reduced it was flavored perfectly and it didn't need any. The rest of the recipe I followed normally and accompanied it with sticky white rice. I expected a new unique experience with the olive flavor and I wasn't disappointed. My wife and I loved it and I couldn't eat enough of it. My teenager turned her nose up at it but I chalk that up to her not liking green olives. I will make this again and again. This recipe is very different but in a great way...we personally loved it.
