Well wouldn't ya know - I changed it - only because I don't eat regular potatoes unless their mashed with gravy on special Holidays!?! But I do serve sweet potatoes - and that's what I used. We love mushrooms and onions sauteed' on anything - so decided to give this a try and it worked!! My husband would have liked sour cream more but I was fine with the yogurt. All in all it was a very healthy - and fine tasting meal. I served it with a salad - and will make again sometime. It would probably be great with a bit of cheese on top - but I was looking for healthy and low fat. Thanks!",

I made a few changes - I used a medium potato doubled the mushrooms and onions and used plain greek yogurt (more like sour cream in taste and texture but really healthy)! Also 10 minutes in the microwave is a bit long if you're using a 1100 watt model - I strongly suggest starting with a shorter microwave time otherwise the bottom of the potato will get hard (and I like to eat all of the skin!)",
