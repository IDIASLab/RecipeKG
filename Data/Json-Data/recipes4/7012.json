I would definitely cook them separately next time. Also I added poultry seasoning to the chopped chicken and when finished added Locatelli parmesan to the top of each serving which seemed to be just the extra flavor that was needed (a little bland otherwise). It was really good- even my picky teenager had 2 bowls! Will be making again.",

Corn and peas and cut up green beans work well along with the carrots or in place of them. Sometimes I use pasta or else rice or potatoes depending on what I have on hand. This recipe is very versatile and you can get creative by adding garlic seasoning and a bit of red pepper flakes for a little kick. A chicken buillon cube can be added too. I make quite a few batches of soup during the cold months and none of them ever turn out the same but all have been excellent!",
