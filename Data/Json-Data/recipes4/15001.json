The only thing I changed was that I peeled the eggplant because the skin can be chewy sometimes, I added sliced roma (plum) tomatoes, used fresh basil instead of thyme leaves because I didn't have any and omitted the cheese because we can't consume dairy during this purification. We sprinkled red pepper flakes on top along with some fresh parsley.  We didn't miss the cheese. We served it over quinoa. We will definitely have this again long after the cleanse is over.

Some advice:  Make sure you salt the eggplant prior to using to draw out the moisture or the ratatouille will become wet and soggy!  Salt each side of the sliced eggplant and let it sit for 30 min, then rinse off and pat dry. If you don't have time for this you shouldn't add as much water. I used some spaghetti sauce instead of tomato paste (didn't have it) and again, did not add as much water.  1 tablespoon of minced garlic was plenty. Thanks for the great recipe!",
