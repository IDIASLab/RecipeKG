I sauteed the mushrooms and shrimp together with extra garlic and white wine and slightly undercooked since I knew they would cook more when added to the sauce. I used 8 oz cream cheese, extra basil, and instead of water used 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 white wine and the liquid from after the mushrooms and shrimp had sat. Also added parmesan. I think next time I will try with lower fat cream cheese just to see if I can get the same results. I can see doing this in the spring with salmon and aspargus. YUM!!!",

The best part of this recipe is you can change it to your liking, add mushrooms or if you don't like them, use another vegetable like broccoli or asparagus or even pea pods!  I always add extra garlic just because I REALLY love garlic.  The recipe calls for shrimp, but I've also used chicken for this and pasta possibilities are endless!  Penne, cavatapi, fusilli, linguini, fettuccini.. I've even used chinese lomein noodles (for extra protein).  Fresh cracked black pepper to top this is a must it truly brings out the flavor of everything.  Go ahead, try this recipe and post your combination and thoughts!  :)",

Per others - while sauting the mushrooms, I added 1/2 red & 1/2 green bell pepper (chopped), apprx 1 TBLS minced green onion and 1 chicken breast (chopped). I too used cream cheese w/ chives and added a splash of white wine (not the cooking kind wht wine!) to the sauce. It wasn't too thick like others complained about and the flavors were great.  The addition of the xtra veggies made the dish look even more appealing! Served with garlic toast and you have yourself and great meal!! Thanks Karyn & All Recipes!!",
