I left about 1 T of fat to cook veggies in instead of butter. I reduced the diced tomatoes to only 1 C. Used 1.5 lbs of lean ground beef and omitted the veal and sausage. Mixed the cooked bacon in with the meat along with the egg and condiments. I reduced the spicy mustard to 1 T only because I ran out. Next time I make this i will not bake the glaze on I will use it as a sauce on top when serving. The sauce is yummy and I wish it was more evenly disbursed over the meat. Also the sauce made draining the fat off the meatloaf difficult. Every time I tipped the pan to drain the fat sauce would fall off and splatter making a huge mess.",

It has the right amount of everything. There are telephone books shorter than the ingredients list for this meatloaf I know. I even had to go to the grocery store twice just to get everything. Don't fret or give up it is worth it. My husband didn't ask me to marry him though. It's not the meatloaf's fault. He was too busy stealing my portion.
