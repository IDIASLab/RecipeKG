Plus I don't know how deep the author's pie plate is but I made two 9\" deep dish pies from this recipe. If you include the time needed to bake the pumpkins this is not quick or easy. However getting the kids in on doing the mashing is fun. I like the texture of this filling a lot it is firmer than most others less custard-like.

I used a few shortcuts including store-bought crusts (I used graham-cracker crust instead of regular pie crust). I used what I thought was a medium-sized pumpkin but I ended up with WAY more pumpkin flesh than I needed. I also had more success processing the whole mixture in a blender than with a potato masher. Halfway through cooking the cookie sheet holding my 2 pies slid off the shelf when I opened the oven. I scooped the pie filling back in (no way was I wasting it after all that effort) and continued baking. They were kind of ugly in the end but they tasted heavenly. My husband (who didn't prep the pumpkin) has asked that I make it this way from now on instead of using canned pumpkin!",
