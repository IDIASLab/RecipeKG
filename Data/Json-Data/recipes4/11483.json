My prep time was definitely more than 30 minutes, even with my daughter's help (although probably due to my substitutions), but well worth the effort.  I used part sweet, part hot turkey sausage, lots of minced fresh garlic cooked with the sausage & onion, fresh mushrooms (added with zucchini & tomatoes).  I used brown rice, doubled the amount as per others' suggestions, and lots more than a pinch of oregano. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion to remove the mixture with a slotted spoon and allow the liquid to reduce. Per my family's tastes, I used a mixture of shredded parmesan and mozzarella in place of the processed cheese, then topped with more shredded mozz.  Only needed about 30 to 40 minutes in the oven.  Everyone raved!  Thanks Mandy!",

I followed some suggestions also posted here like using a spicy Italian sausage instead of using plain and added other herbs garlic salt and pepper. I found the recipies was too big for my pan by the time I needed to add the rice cheese and mushrooms so I used a mixing bowl. I also recommend using a slotted spoon to remove the zucchini mixture as the zucchini and tomato sweat a lot and reducing the 2 cups of liquid that remained in the pan until it is about 1/2 cup of beautiful flavour. I also made a breadcrumb topping with just 1/4 cup of cheese added. This one is a winner!!!!",

I was also afraid that 1/2 cup of rice wouldn't be enough but it was great. I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe--and coming from me that really means a lot!",
