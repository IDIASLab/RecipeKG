Using the advice of previous reviewers I used italian sausage and ground beef and added about 3/4 cup of water. I did not add the tomato soup either. I found wagon wheel shaped pasta and used it since it resembles a sliced pizza. I also under cook the pasta because it will soak up a lot of moisture and turn mushy. You may need to add a little extra water after this has been cooking for a few hours too. This is a keeper!",

                "reviewBody": "This is yummy.  After reading other reviews I made a few changes as follows:  I used a bottle of spaghetti sauce as opposed to two little bottles of pizza sauce.  I then mixed all the ingredients together instead of layering.  The mixture definitely needs spices, and I added quite a bit (a few teaspoons) of chopped garlic, as well as some basil and S&P.  It got dry and I added a bit of water.  Next time I will sautee some onions as i'm browning the ground beef and add it to the mix, as well as add a can or two of mushrooms (or fresh).  I used turkey pepperoni and there is none of that pepperoni grease.  I will probably use smaller noodles than rigatoni.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is touted as a \"slow cooker\" recipe but really I don't think it is.  Next time I'll mix it all up in one bowl and probably microwave it for about 15-20 minutes (covered).  That way it won't get dry and all the cheese will be mega-melted.  Even putting it in a casserole dish and putting it in the oven at around 350 for about an hour and a half would work.\r\n\r\nBottom line, the mixture is delicious and hearty.  Can't really go wrong if feeding teenagers and probably would be a big hit at a pot-luck, too.  Enjoy!",

I followed the recipe exactly (make sure you cook the ground beef before you place it in your cooker) and then I went out for four hours. When I got home it looked delicious! And it was!! It was the best!! Much better than Baked Ziti or some of those other pasta dishes. My kids had thirds and my sister came over and raved about it. I really enjoyed it and this will be brought to many pot lucks and barbeques. THANKS JILL!!",

Be sure you are using a LARGE slow cooker--I have a small one and couldn't quite fit all the ingredients in. I found the layering to be a little fiddly like making a lasgna. The whole point of using a slow cooker is to throw in the ingredients and walk away for a few hours...no throwing here. Hubby liked the taste but the kids weren't overly thrilled. And it looked like a dog's breakfast. Won't try this one again.",
