I've been curious to try this for a long time and I'll tell you all I did was heat a little bit of canola oil in a small saucepan mix some bisquick with water to pancake consistency dip two oreos in the batter and fry them til golden while I cooked my spaghetti on the other burner. It was that simple. This is one where you don't even need to print out the recipe. I can't believe how good these taste. Sampling the two I made was just perfect also because a little of these go a long way. But I will definitely make these again for family members to try! Thanks for sharing.",
