The Old Bay called for is way too much - also, when steaming the shrimp, make sure to \"steam\" - not boil them.  Use a colander inside a large saucepan.  I make mine using 12oz. of beer such as Fat Tire Amber Ale or Corona, about 3/4 cup of water, 3T Old Bay and 1/4 white vinegar - bring to a fast boil and reduce to simmer.  I also sprinkle a little Old Bay and Zatarain's Blackened Seasoning and a bit of Lemon Pepper over the shrimp - then into the colander (over the gently boiling beer/water/vinegar) they go.  Cover and steam depending on size of shrimp.  I use fairly large size and will keep the liquid on a low boil so the shrimp steam just until tails begin to curl.  Chill or serve immediately.",

                "reviewBody": "Here is my 5 star version. Put a ceramic plate in the refrigerator to chill. Use the largest raw shrimp you can find, ok if it is frozen; I like the 13-15 shrimp per lb. for a minimum size. Defrost, de-vein and shell. Rinse, pat dry and sprinkle lemon-pepper, Old Bay and whatever dry-rub you like to make spicy. I use Steve Raichlin's Creole Rub. Put a 12 oz flavorful beer, a splash of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of Old Bay in a giant steamer pot with a lid; when it begins to boil, set each shrimp in the steamer basket. Put the lid back on, and in 3 minutes, you will have the most delish shrimps ever. Eat one, then spread the rest on the cold plate, stick in the frig for 1 hour minimum, 4 hrs. max. In the meantime, make the cocktail sauce: I use a refrigerated brand of local horseradish that doesnt even have a brand name, it is basically coarsely cut fresh ground horseradish with a little vinegar and soybean oil. if you want GOOD REAL HOT cocktail sauce, REAL horseradish is required, not the processed  in the salad dressing aisle. I use any prepared cocktail sauce from a bottle, doesn't matter what kind; and mix equal parts fresh horseradish with the prepared sauce. You could use ketchup. Whatever! Then, I add the juice of a small lemon, whip it and whip it good and stick it in the frig (while the shrimpies are cooling down) to mix all those fine flavors. About an hour later my husband of 9 years begs me to marry him all over again. That is all. Good luck and have fun. Yeah!",
