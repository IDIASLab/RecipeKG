It's great for a quick dinner or relaxed breakfast. The secret to crispy hash is using precooked potatoes. Goes great with biscuits, too.",

My pulled pork was from a picnic roast that I had used to make some posole. I was relieved to find something besides BBQ to use up the meat I had left. I like spicy foods so I did add a little more cayenne. Serving this with a nice over-easy or soft poached egg is just perfect. I will make this again.",
