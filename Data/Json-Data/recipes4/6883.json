Going on suggestions from other reviews: I prefer stiff mash so adding milk to the broth already in the pot does make it too thin. Three options: strain majority of the broth before mashing and adding milk don't add the milk OR use a full 3lb bag (or more) of potatoes. I didn't add milk; don't think the creaminess was diminished due to the sour cream. Also I used 1 tsp pepper rather than 1T and it is still quite peppery.",
