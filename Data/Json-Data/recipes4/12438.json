It takes a bit longer to make than it states but it is well worth it. I loved it my friends loved it and many asked me for the recipe. I brought the leftovers to Easter and the grandparents loved it too. If you use live crab make sure you kill it before you place into boiling water (15 mins). Also I added a bit more carrots and celery. Make sure to use a white onion.",

Some modifications...I honestly didn't want to put canned crab in the bisque instead used 2 cans of minced clams (not drained) and one can of oysters (DRAINED). Perhaps with the extra juice from the extra can of clams it was too soupey so we added one more tablespoon of flour. We also thought it was a bit bland while simmering so we added one more buillion cube and garlic salt to taste. This was amazing and Matt and Me are super happy we found this recipe!",

I did add extra veggies and even added some left over mashed potato used extra flour/water slurry to thinken but even that didn't do it for me. I guess I just like a thicker soup. Next time I will puree some of the veggie/potato/broth mix and add back before adding the seafood. I also cooked this much longer that the recipe calls for even small diced potatoes need a longer cooking time. Thanks for a nice submission I enjoyed trying this.",
