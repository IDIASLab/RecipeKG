So the sauce would taste like what I'm used to from our local restaurant, I added some of the canola oil I used to cook the omelets to the pan and made a roux. I then added chicken broth, soy sauce, Gravy Master and seasonings. The result was a nice rich gravy that helped make this dish even more amazing than it already is. Thanks a bunch Dakota!",

I added a couple pinches of salt to my eggs as well as mixed a few drops of sesame oil. And being extra lazy... I just cut up the mushrooms up really tiny and mixed it into the eggs also.    So for the sauce... I just left it plain and added a additional ingredient which was a few pinches of sugar to it so it gave it a nice carmelized taste. Then added the diced green onions as well as some toasted sesame seeds on top as garnish.  Yum :9  People were saying they weren't sure how to make it into a thick pancake.  The trick is to make a large / thin egg layer... fold the edges so it's shaped sorta like a octagon. Now you have a nice round and \"thick\" little egg pancake.  Great for fitting it on top of a nice little mound of rice in a bowl.",

I made a few changes to this recipe based on what I had on hand...no bean sprouts but instead I added some diced zucchini and carrots a little shallot and some chinese sausage. I cooked it all just a little bit in some peanut oil drained it on a paper towel and then added it to the egg mixture as directed. The sauce was PERFECT just as it was. This satisfied my craving...but with this recipe in my stash I'm sure it will be back sooner than later! Thank you!",

I ended up squirting ketchup all over it and eating it like i would my eggs. It is very easy to shape them into pancakes. All you have to do it laddle about 1/3cup of the mixture slowly into the pan and with your spatula bring the edges towards the middle of the mixture shaping it into a circle. Does that make sense? I know- im horrible at explaining. But i would think its common sense. Anyways wont be making this version again but may attempt a different recipe.",
