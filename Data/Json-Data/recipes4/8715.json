                "reviewBody": "This made an excellent tasting burger and I was pleasantly surprised! I used gargonzola cheese and the tint of thyme was very good....something I would never have tried on my own. I used dried thyme not fresh. This might be why another reviewer thought the thyme was overpowering. Remember don't use the same measurement when switching. I would probably use only half the amount in any receipe when switching from fresh to dried. I didn't even have to use ketchup or mustard etc. like I normally would. Just a slice of tomato red onion and fresh lettuce on a Martin's Potato Roll was terrific. Since I had purchased a pint container of gargonzola and had extra burger (used 80%) I made 2 extra and placed them in the freezer. Remember to make them large and pretty flat before adding the cheese mixture. Seal the edges good so no cheese can escape while cooking. They will shrink while cooking and with both top and bottom patties they are a pretty hardy burger. These would be great for most adults if trying to cook up something a little different for a change. No flavor was so overpowering that it can't be enjoyed by most. Just follow the directions and make sure to use half the amount of thyme if not using fresh.",
