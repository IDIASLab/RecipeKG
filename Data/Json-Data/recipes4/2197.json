                "reviewBody": "I made this back in October on a grouse hunting trip. Before cooking the meat I \"bled\" it overnight to get rid of the game-y taste (refrigerate in salted water overnight). We also got as much meat as possible off the bird, and cut the \"dark meat\" pieces small, keeping the breasts whole. I sauteed all the meat in the skillet and threw it all into a roasting pan. After it was cooked through I removed the breasts, and put the roaster right onto the stove top to make my gravy in there. I left those little pieces of \"dark\" meat in the roaster and OMG did it ever make the gravy nice. I can't wait to make this again. To Terri: dry partridge is almost inevitable. It doesn't take very long to cook and even slight overcooking dries it out. Baste frequently while it roasts and try not to overcook. I cook it till it's so close to done it might as well be, take it out of the oven and let it rest, tented, in a warm spot. The temp will continue to rise which should get it just right. Use chicken temp guidelines. Good luck :)",

I used a 8\" casserole dish instead of shallower baking dish to house the sauce and the breasts (this somewhat poaches the meat so you don't have to baste the meat while cooking). I also reduced the cooking time to 35 minutes and the meat came out perfectly moist. Parsley is a good addition to the sauce and for plating on top of each breast.",
