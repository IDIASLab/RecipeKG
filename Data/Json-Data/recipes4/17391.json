Next time I will use the low setting exclusively or shorten the cooking time. Since I used a Cabernet instead of port I left out the sugar - which I did not miss. I would like to try the port which would add a stronger flavor. If I skip the port again I will add 1/2t red pepper flakes and increase the amount of onion to compensate. I also think sliced mushrooms would be a good addition either way.",

I also added a pint of water instead of a quart by accident. So there was a fair bit of liquid so I put the vegetables below on the bottom submerged and a pork loin roast on top. The loin was still somewhat immersed in the liquid but mostly above. I also aggressively singed the roast for a good 10 minutes to lock in the juices and to maintain the structure as much as possible during slow cooking. The 6 hours on high was enough to cook it and break down the fat and connective tissues it was not necessary to continue cooking on low and I think it would be destructive to the dish if this were to be done but perhaps this is dependent on how powerful a given slow cooker is and how long one singes the roast. The pork does come out a little dry but I used the jus to make gravy by adding some flour(in the future I will add less water as I had to boil a lot off). The results were excellent. I will keep this recipe in my back pocket it is a good base on which to experiment on in the future for me.",
