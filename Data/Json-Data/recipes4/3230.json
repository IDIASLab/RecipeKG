Mixing the zucchini and mushroom into the sauce helped address the issue of the lasagna not having enough layers as many reviewers noted.  Quite possibly one of the best lasagna's I have ever had.

Do use a dish deeper than a standard 9x13 because it makes a pan FULL of lasagna. If you do not have a deeper one use a cookie sheet covered in tinfoil on the next rack down under your 9x13. I followed the direcitons exactly except I sliced my zucchini into rounds instead of lengthwise. When I read the reviews for this the recipe submitter actually uses dried chipotle chilis but I could not find these at my local shopping places so I did use the chipotles in adobo. I used 2 but next time will add 3 or 4. They add a nice spiciness to the lasagna. I served this with Lime Iced Tea and Harvest Salad from this site and store-bought garlic bread. This recipe is a definite keeper. Thanks for sharing Lori:)",

For our tastes used 1 T. of the chipolte chili in adobo sauce (about 2 chilis) 3/4 t. sea salt 3/4 t. black pepper and it was just perfect. Also used the diced tomatoes as others suggested. Had to use dried spices; 1 t. basil and 2 t. oregano. Used 2 containers of mushrooms Neufchatel in place of cream cheese and a slightly bigger bag of spinach. Didn't have Asiago so doubled the amount of Parmesan. I don't think it made a bit of difference using what I had on hand. This was absolutely to die for! This made one 9 x 13\" and one 9x9\".",

We did not like the cream cheese taste and prefer Ricotta/Cottage Cheese in our Lasagna. The meat sauce was awesome however. The addition of the Chipotle chili and the Hot italian sausace made it! Next time we make lasagna we will use this meat sauce but put it in a more traditional lasagna recipe.",
