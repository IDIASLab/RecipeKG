Love this recipe because of the comprehensive list of vegetables you could use to make a vegan stock and most of all it s a slow cooker method. It s the best vegetable stock I ve made thus far and I didn t have some of the ingredients on hand or had to omit a few because of current dietary restrictions. Flavor wise -- perfect balance overall and much better than store bought. As the author notes add any veggies you may have on hand. I didn t use fennel apple garlic shallot GF beer or Worcestershire. Actually used green onions that were going to be wasted and the stock is absolutely delicious despite the omission of a few ingredients. Also tossed in a few thyme sprigs I had on hand. There s a great amount of versatility in making this recipe! I started making the recipe late afternoon yesterday and let it cook on low overnight about 12-13 hours total with no problems. Another option would be to roast all the veggies on a rimmed sheet tray for about 45 min dump in slow cooker add the peppercorns lemon ginger tamari soy sauce Worcestershire garlic bay leaf and other fresh herbs and water. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe Buckwheat Queen!",
