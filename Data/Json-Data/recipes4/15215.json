Brown meat in 2 TBLS of oil and season meat with seasoning salt. Add the meat with its remaining oil and juices into crockpot. ADD 1/2 TBLS of dry italian salad dressing mix to the other ingredients in the crockpot. 2 large cloves of garlic instead of 1. Instead of 6 small potatoes I added 3/4 bag or 24 oz of a 32 oz bag of frozen hash brown potatoes at the end of cooking when meat was tender. Continue to leave crockpot on High to cook potatoes, probably another 15 min. Finally, I mixed 2 TBLS of flour with 2 TBLS of cold water. The first time I made this recipe I added 3 TBLS but it was too thick.",

Easily reduce-able too....I made a recipe for 4 and still have a full pot.",

I omit the green pepper and substitute a cup of peas at the end of the cooking time and let the stew simmer another 5 minutes.  I've also substituted tomato paste and some red wine for the tomato sauce with excellent results!  Try this recipe - you won't be sorry.  Serve with some delicious rolls or bread and add a little more liquid to the pot if you're family enjoys sopping up lots of gravy!",
