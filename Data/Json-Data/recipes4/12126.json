After that was cooked I added back the onion and garlic, then used a 1/2 can of cream of chicken soup, 3/4 cup of light sour cream, and a splash or two of salt free chicken broth. Once mixed in I added sliced mushrooms and peas. I didn't need to add any salt, but my husband did add cracked pepper to his serving. We also used egg noodles. For the amount of turkey we had, it only made 3 good size servings.\nI typically don't have sour cream around, so this is a meal I will have to prepare for.",

Instead, I slivered one small white onion and one clove garlic, then sauteed the turkey with that.  I also added about 2 tbsps. dried parsley flakesfor flavor and color, and one can of sliced mushrooms, drained, then salted with a bit of garlic salt. At the end, I added one cup sour cream, which you really need to do  if you want this to taste anything like stroganoff and not just ground turkey gravy.  I did like how it turned out, served it over wide egg noodles, and will be making it again. Thanks for the idea!  SUPER easy to pull together.",
