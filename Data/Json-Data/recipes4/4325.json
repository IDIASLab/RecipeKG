Also, in step 4, I repeat dipping the mozzarella sticks into the egg wash and into the bread crumbs. And of course, serve with marinara sauce ;). Enjoy!",

I took the submitter's advice and double breaded them and that created an awesome crispy coating which I loved! Also I didn't measure the milk but I know that I did not use the full 2 cups maybe only 1/2-3/4 cup and I still had some leftover after double dipping the sticks. These may seem a little time consuming but they are absolutely not. All in all this was a great concept and they are good! I will definately be making these again with a few minor adjustments!
