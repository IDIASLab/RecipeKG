I would suggest however that you saute the fennel for about 10-12 minutes instead of only five. Just keep checking it until it softens up enough. Really the only way you'll get it right is to check it (pick up a piece and eat it!) until it's cooked to a level of tenderness that you like. Also I took the foil cover off and just continued to bake it for another 5-10 minutes instead of turning the broiler on (my baking dish can't be used under a broiler). Great flavor tastes even better the next day and freezes really well. A winner!!",

I used hot Italian turkey sausage an Italian blend of shredded cheese 1/8 of a HUGE onion instead of half and didn't have any roasted red pepper but it still turned out so great! I bought some fennel from the farmer's market and was trying to find a recipe to use it in that my husband would still eat - and he did second helpings and leftovers! After reading the other reviews I made sure to slice the fennel as thinly as I could and it was still a little crunchy but it didn't detract from the meal at all. I have tried a lot of recipes from this site but this is the first that turned out like it was supposed to on my first try! The flavor was just wonderful presentation was beautiful not too dry and what flavor! My 18 month old liked it too!",
