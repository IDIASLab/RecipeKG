Just reading the recipe with a \"chef's eye\" you can tell this is far superior to the other ones posted on this site.  i don't give out many 5 star ratings, but this is most definitely one of them.  i was searching for a crab/corn chowder recipe because my husband and i enjoy Bonefish Grill's version so much, but it is pricey - $6.50 for a bowl.  I searched the internet for a bonefish grill copycat chowder recipe, no luck. Came on reliable all recipes, and I was just hoping this chowder would taste good, as it seemed like it would - but it tasted IDENTICAL to bonefish grills (if you are the author reading this, please take this as a compliment!)   The changes I made were as follows:  omitted celery and the shrimp (personal preference). no clarified butter - didnt have time - just used a regular tablespoon of butter, worked fine.  Cajun seasoning instead of Creole (I'm sure its next to the same thing).  and canned golden corn and canned jumbo lump crab instead of fresh.   It was, ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.  Try this, I promise you won't be disappointed.   (unless you don't like spicy - it does pack a little heat! ;)",

                "reviewBody": "Normally I try to stay true to the original person\u2019s recipe unless the masses have agreed to some changes but I had to re-work this recipe for 3 reasons.  #1.  Everybody who is eating my chowder agreed that the Bonefish grill was WAY too spicey (in ALL their dishes, not just the chowder).  I\u2019m a spice light-weight, and my wife is a total spice wuss so I just couldn\u2019t make it as-is based on the other reviews.  #2. I don\u2019t have the alcohol required in my house (I\u2019m more of a Jim Beam kinda guy) and it\u2019s Sunday in PA and I can\u2019t buy it.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll bother next time either since it doesn\u2019t call for much so I would be wasting it.  #3. Corn is now out of season and the only small shrimp I liked at the market was cooked/pieces so I went for it \u2013 and crab around here sucks right now.  So here is the Spice Wuss/Alcohol Free/Out of Season Variation:  I replaced the cayenne with double the amount of Old Bay and dropped Creole seasoning completely.  I replaced the white wine with pure motts apple juice and the brandy with apple cider vinegar.  I used a 1 lb bag of frozen white corn/yellow corn mix partly thawed in the fridge.  Since my shrimp was cooked I left it out until the potatoes were cooked then tossed them in and let it come back up to a simmer then added the crab meat (which was canned chicken of the sea premium crab meat..all real crab).  I then left the whole thing on the stove on warm until dinner time (about an hour) so by then everything was a perfect temperature.",

After letting it sit in the fridge all night, I let it cook one more day on low until we enjoyed it that evening.  I think soups are much better after they have had time to marinate.  Instead of small size shrimp, I used petite shrimp for salad or shrimp salad.    This soup is delicious and definately worth making. I am from Maryland and love cream of crab soup.  This is a lot more than just corn and crab soup.",

I'm sorry but I really wanted to rate this well based on the previous reviews.  I have been to Anthony's and Duke's (fine seafood restaurants) and they have had a corn, crab and bourbon bisque that is to die for and is very similar to each other.  I have been searching and thought this recipe was similar.  I followed this recipe EXACTLY and it ended up VERY bland.  I didn't want to waste so much money with the crab, shrimp, etc. that I ended up going back to the store just to liven it up.  I added more shrimp, creole, brandy, wine and even after all that, it still seemed bland that I put in a tablespoon of vanilla.  After all that, it only tasted fair.  I'm sorry but this is not worth the time and money (at least for me). :( I will keep searching.",

My husband, the Chowder Connoisseur, who has ordered chowder in every city we have ever vacationed at, said it was the best he ever tasted. I did reduce the cayenne pepper for him though. hubby doesn't do hot. AND, I completely forgot to put in the bacon, which I did fry, but I'm a Senior- what can I say.  \n\nAfter cooking the bacon crisp, I sauteed the veggies in the bacon fat- I really think that was enough of the \"fat\". but, next time, I will definitely add the bacon. This is one of the best soup recipes I have ever come across.\n\nThanks Sheryl!\n\n\nNext time, I will put in the bacon, but not the grease... I think it is enough if you just saute the veggies in the reserved bacon fat. Then",
