When I make this I mix all the ingredients in the crockpot (saving myself from cleaning an unnecessary dish) cover and let it cook for hours. I agree with the other reviewers that said it did not need to cook for that long so test it after a few hours. Also this recipe calls for only 2 packages of spinach which makes the dish too runny - it ends up more like a dip. I added an additional package of spinach for a total of 3 and it turned out perfect. You can use any cheese you would like as well. I used white cheddar and it was delicious. This recipe has been around for decades (my great aunt used to make this in the 70's) so it's definitely a keeper. Just tweek it to your likeness and you'll have this staple creamed spinach recipe for years.",

The only thing I did differently than the recipe said was I just mixed everything together inside the crock pot instead of mixing it in a bowl and dumping it in. Saved me a dish! I also lined my slow cooker with one of those slow cooker bags so I had no mess. This was delicious and simple. Next time I may tweak the spices just for fun to see what happens. I used light cottage cheese and american cheese and next time I may use egg whites just to keep this dish low fat and not cancel out the health benefits of spinach. I served this it a birthday dinner with lots of family. Most of the kids wouldnt' try it because it had spinach in it but a couple did and they were surprised that they liked it.",
