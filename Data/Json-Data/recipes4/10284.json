Millet is also a prebiotic. It feeds the good bacteria in the digestive system. Very healthy and delicious!",

I just used some goat's milk as a portion of the hot water amount (I think I had about 1/2 to 3/4 cups left in the carton that I used). Then instead of coconut I put in the same amount of dried blueberries. They rehydrated nicely while baking and gave a lovely fruity flavor to the cereal! The nice thing is that the dates (and the blueberries) give this all the sweetness it needs so there's no need to add all sorts of sugar. I'll be making this again and I'll probably experiment with other kinds of dried fruits as well.",

I don't use soy so heated up 4 cups of coconut milk with 1 1/2 cups of water and used that instead. Other than that I made the recipe as directed. I can't wait to try it again with the addition of some cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice....possibly a rum extract instead of vanilla. I read another review that included dried fruit such as blueberries....that sounds delicious to me and I'll probably try that as well!
