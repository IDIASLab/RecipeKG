Used 1 Red & 1 Green Pepper 1 Red Onion fresh ground pepper 1/2 teaspoon or to taste 4 Red potatoes (sliced like potato chips but thicker and added 1 1/2 tsp Mrs. Dash Italian Medley 2tsp Parsley (freshly chopped). I did with these specs but times 3 as I needed bigger serving size. I used cast iron skillets and it came out wonderful and very colorful. I recommend changing up the peppers to red green yellow and orange. Not only for color but some peppers are sweeter than others if you want something along the lines of sweetness. Next time I will be cutting back on the oil beings that much oil was not needed due to the fact that kielbasa is naturally greasy anyhow. If you decide to add the fresh garlic and parsley add with the onions and oil.:)",

We really enjoyed this dish... and even though I may have changed it up a bit to suit our particular tastes I'm still rating it a 5.

Another suggestion is to add the peppers a little later in the cooking process since they got very mushy but overall this recipe is a 5 ya'll!!!!",

The kielbasa really seasons the potato/onion/green pepper mixture. The only thing I would do differently with this one would be to add the peppers during the last 20 minutes of cooking. They really get pretty soggy and I guess it's just a personal preference to have a more crisp green pepper. Thanks much - this recipe is great!",
