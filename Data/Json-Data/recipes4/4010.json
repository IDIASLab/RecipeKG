Put in CP added the rest Including the pearl barley. I ran it on high for a couple hours and turned it down to low when I left for work. I checked it a couple of times. Please do not cook beef till tender before you add it to the cp. I did it the way I said and the meat was more then fork tender. I had it cooking from 6am till 4:30pm. My hubby liked it a lot! This stew has soo many flavors going on. You get a chunk of beef in one bite and then you get a yam. As I was making this dish I was thinking these items don't go together but some how they work very well with each other.:) I served it with mixed veggies and buttered sourdough bread. I will make this again:)Thank You Very much Basg! One perfect meal for the up coming season!!",

I like barley but doing this in the crock pot with so many starchy potatoes made this turn mushy. And on top of that the barley absorbed a lot of the sauce/gravy. I would also step up the seasoning and probably double most of the recommendations.",

That's okay...more leftovers for me to enjoy!! I used beef broth instead of water for more flavor and had to leave out the sweet potato because I forgot to buy one. I also did not do the stovetop step. I browned the beef and put it in the crock pot then sauteed the onions and garlic and added them to the crock pot with the rest of the ingredients. I cooked it on high for about 5-1/2 hours and everything was perfectly tender. Contrary to the feelings of another reviewer I found the amount of barley to be just right. I'll probably make this again with the sweet potato because I'm sure it adds some great flavor to the dish.",

I was unfamiliar with cholent which I have now concluded is a kind of versatile beef stew. Had I known this I probably would not have made it because my family are not big beef stew lovers. If yours is however it is definitely worth trying. It was the best beef stew I have tried. I did think it had a sourness to it that I didn't care for so I added a tbsp of brown sugar and 2 more tbsp of bbq (sweet) sauce. If I made it again I would use a 32oz. can (double the recipe) of brown sugar baked beans no additional brown sugar and 3tbsp of a sweet bbq sauce. I also added a bag of frozen corn which was a great addition. I browned the stew meat with the onions garlic salt and pepper. Then I added the remaining ingredients (I did omit the barley after reading another review) covered with water and cooked it on low for about 9 hours in my crockpot. I turned it up to high and removed the lid for an additional hour just to let it thicken up. Everything was tender and flavorful.",

                "reviewBody": "This was mediocre at best. I must admit the ingredient list (the combination alone) intrigued me. This didn't taste terrible... it's just BLAND! My fiance added s&p to taste and said that seemed to do the trick. My issue with this is that it's no more than a mere pot full of \"odds and ends.\" Everything works together but doesn't necessarily complement each other. This reminds me of Saturday's as a kid. My mom would clean out the fridge combine leftovers from that week and either make a soup stew or casserole with them. Not that my memories are horrid (my mom always managed to make something good) but I'm not looking for a repeat of that. If I were I'd do just that and wouldn't bother with a recipe. NOTE: My fiance had a difficult time fining barley at our well-stocked grocery store (I had to send him out for last night because I forgot to pick some up when grocery shopping this past weekend). Turns out pearl barley is located in the ethnic aisle next to the Jewish / kosher items. NOTE #2: It is not necessary to cook on the stove first. Just brown your onions / garlic / meat and add to a well-greased slow cooker with everything else. Add either water or broth (I used beef broth) cover and cook on low for 11-12 hours. Served wtih slices of fresh caraway rye bread this was filling nonetheless. Thanks for sharing your authentic quirky recipe Basg. At least I was able to broaden my \"ethnic\" horizions.:-)",

Instead of water I used beef broth for taste and added A1 Steak Sauce and Worcestershire Sauce to compliment the meat. I also added some Rosemary and more Italian seasoned herbs to it so it would not have such an acidic taste from the sauces. I went heavy on the Paprika as I always do but that's the way I like it. When the final product was finished I had enough to feed me for a week and I am not lying. Hence the name Poverty's Cholent Delight.",
