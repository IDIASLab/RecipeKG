So, simply said, this soup is simply excellent...in every way. It's easy to prepare (I bought a rotisserie chicken and made a stock of the carcass), uses just a few, simple, fresh and healthy ingredients, smells awesome good while cooking, pretty to look at, and goes down reaaaaaaal easy and good. I also appreciated that the soup depends strictly on the flavor of its few, good ingredients and doesn't have to be pumped up with a ton of spices and herbs to make it good. Delicious, simple comfort food. Oh - and I prepared the recipe exactly as the submitter wrote it, not using the optional cornstarch slurry. It was perfectly thick and hearty without it!  (I originally posted this review back in February 2011 when it was still a \u201cPersonal Recipe.\u201d  Glad to see it now published as a \u201cKitchen Approved Recipe!\u201d)",

However due to high cholesterol issues at our house, we opted for a lower fat version made by substituting the half and half for fat free evaporated milk. (Fat free half and half will also work but I prefer the flavor of the evaporated fat free milk). We also increased the spinach to 8 ounces for extra iron and decreased the gnocchi by half. I let the soup cook a little longer, uncovered on simmer, to thicken. Saved a ton of calories while keeping the flavor of the original recipe and was super healthy!",

Personally I also had just a hint of nutmeg and a Tbsp of sugar. I would always add these seasonings along with salt and pepper to the veggies once cooked and leave for a minute before adding anything else to let them infuse. Also I would suggest a quick chop to the spinach so you don't get long slimy strings. These changes will make it 5 stars.",

This is so similar to Olive Garden's recipe it's scary! I did try a few things different; but not much. I used about a cup or cup and a half more chicken broth because I made my own homemade gnocchis that my family has been making for YEARS and added about a tablespoon of flour to the soup after I poured in the half and half for a slightly thicker consistency. Turned out AMAZING. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!! I'm definitely keeping this one safe.\n\nHOMEMADE GNOCCHIS \n--------------------------\nfor this recipe: \n1 cup left over mashed potatoes (just butter and milk mashed potatoes)\n1 cup flour\ntsp salt\n\nMix all together with your hands and roll out like a snake and cut into cubes. Use these in place of the premade gnocchis and cook just like the recipe says.\n\nFor another recipe... you can make the gnocchis, boil for about 7 minutes and serve with warm marinara sauce.",

I also added about 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and some spices (to the soup & chicken before roasting) -- thyme, sage, and paprika. \n\nLast time we went to Olive Garden, my husband said he liked this recipe better.
