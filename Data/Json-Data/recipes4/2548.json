You have to put a thin layer of frosting on the cake first if you want the fondant to stick. Using the canned stuff is fine. Just make sure its not the \"whipped\" kind. For some reason it doesnt hold very well. And dont glob it on like youre normally frosting a cake. Just a very thin layer.",

This is what I've been looking for...Super easy to make, sometimes it needs a little more XXX sugar...I leave it sit for aleast 2 hour..it helps with that greasy texture... I use a 20 qt. the Kitchen Aid can't handle the load, so if you use a Kitchen Aid you have to get the dough out ASAP and you have to kneed it longer.. and sit longer because it will get super soft.. as far as rolling it out.. try letting it sit for about 5 minutes before you punch out shapes and or lifting the icing \n\nThanks for the Recipe\n\nJeff",
