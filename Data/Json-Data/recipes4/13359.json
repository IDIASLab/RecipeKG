It was their stuffed bell peppers. Part of what made them unique was their juices and sauce: it was tomato based but very translucent with a slightly sweet and tangy taste. I have yet to recreate the sauce but have developed a substitute which isn't too bad. However, I have in fact finally made the stuffing taste just like I remember it. I hope you enjoy this as much as my family does.",

When you are cooking the meat sauce, place a small cinnamon stick (not cinnamon powder)into the sauce.  Allow the sauce to cook for a good 45 minutes, absorbing the wonderful-ness of the cinnamon.  You can even add a few whole cloves.  This addition applies to anything you are cooking with hamburger meat, example - spaghetti sauce, lasagna meat, stuffed zuccini, moussaka meat, etc.  The taste you are trying to get comes from these spices.  I guarantee it.  Opah, and enjoy!",

Actually it was a toss-up between this recipe and Tina's Greek stuffed peppers recipe. I hate to say I wish I would have tried Tina's peppers instead but I was lazy and thought they were too much work compared to Jeanne's recipe. I guess that's what I get for taking the \"easy\" route lol! While these weren't \"terrible \" there is enough I don't like about them to warrant my mediocre review. For one the filling is VERY dry (I even added half a container of herbed feta to it). My liquid absorbed in half the amount of time suggested (i.e. 8 minutes) but ironically my rice was still a tad crunchy (?). And the sauce... well it isn't a sauce at all! I was wondering how chicken broth and tomatoes would reduce to a thickened sauce but threw all intuition out the window and forged ahead anyways. That was a bad idea.... I'm sad to say I will not be sending my fiance to work with leftovers (since this yields 6 peppers I wanted to give my future in-law's the 4 that were left). Oh well! Maybe this will be to your liking but it wasn't to ours. Thanks anyways Ms. Gold.:-)",
