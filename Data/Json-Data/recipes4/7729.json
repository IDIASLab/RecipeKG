I only had 4 sausages that weighed 3/4 lb so I halved the recipe. I added a yellow pepper used salt free chicken broth 1 tsp dried basil as I didn't have fresh and omitted the salt. I knew there was not going to be enough liquid to cook the pasta in I added 2 cups spaghetti sauce and 2 cups water. I had a 375 gram box of Fusilli pasta that I used which is 13 ounces approximately. I needed to add 2 more cups of water while the pasta was cooking. For future reference I liked the meat to pasta ratio with the 4 sausages and 375 g box of pasta. I would definitely add more vegetables like peppers mushrooms and zucchini. In total I used 3 cups chicken stock 2 cups spaghetti sauce and 4 cups water I would probably add 1 more cup of water as it was really like a stew and I think the leftovers will be quite thick tomorrow. I feel the tbsp of tomato paste is really a waste and I would omit it and just use the spaghetti sauce instead. I really liked the flavour the fire roasted tomatoes added I had never used them before.",
