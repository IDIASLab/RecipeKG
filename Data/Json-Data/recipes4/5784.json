I prefer a little more salt and pepper but that is my taste and I can't find a fault with this alternative to the cream/milk versions we're all used to having.\n\nMy only warning is be very prudent about the mayo and butter usage. It doesn't take a lot extra to make the result a little fatty looking.",

We used white potatoes with the skin left on and they added an extra creamy, melt in your mouth texture.  Left garlic out due to sensitivities to it in our family, but didn't lose any flavor at all.  Also baked it with a layer of shredded cheese on top, just until the cheese started to crisp.  Definitely making this my go to recipe for Scalloped Potatoes from now on.  Would also make a good main casserole dish if you added shredded chicken or pork.",
