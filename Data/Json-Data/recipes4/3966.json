I ended up adding cheddar cheese salt and pepper to try to salvage it. It just didn't work. If I were to try this again I would lessen the garlic powder to 1-2 teaspoons. I would thicken with a roux rather than the potato flakes. The cook time was also off... the potatoes were not cooked enough in the 4 1/2 hours. I ended up having to finish it on the stove due to time constraints. Wish it had come out better. I will stick with my normal potato soup recipe! Thanks!",

The smell of it cooking all afternoon was scrumptious but as it cooked I could tell the onions were going to be overpowering... and while the potato flakes were helpful to thicken it up it may have been too much. If I make this again I ll use about half the suggestion of potato flakes and definitely less onions. I also think it needs one more flavor although I m not sure what I d add just yet. The broccoli is yummy but doesn t have a distinct taste after cooking all afternoon. Either way it was a decent meal and nice to try new things. I almost wonder if it would have maybe been good as a side to a pork tenderloin or even a steak? That would be a heavy meal but on a cold night it might just be perfect.",
