So I combined some of the ingredients from both recipes and created the tastiest cheddar cheese almond flour crackers; using fresh grated sharp cheddar cheese. The cheese also acts as another binder.  I love the idea of using flax seed in the crackers. That enhanced the nutty flavor as well. This is a great snack food by itself or with tuna or salmon salad. The pizza cutter worked very well for precise cutting. Thanks for sharing!",
