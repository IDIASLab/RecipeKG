I cut the potatoes as described and stuffed them with onions but then I drizzled them with olive oil instead of butter. I then drizzled them with a table wine (merlot)and sprinkled them with kosher salt. The wine and olive oil give them such a nice flavor that is cooked in because of the foil (great idea!)",

I used Christian Brothers California Dry Sherry. I replaced the butter with olive oil. Also added some garlic powder to the oil and drizzle sot sauce in with the wine BEFORE the oil. Also cut the onions VERY thin. Half moon shaped wedges fit in good going in an upside down U way. So they bend with the shape of the potato. Also using a butter knife to hold the cuts open worked AMAZING! Glad I read that The oil locked in the juice n flavors. The onion broke down to the consistency of the potatoes. I was cooking for someone that hates the texture of onions. They didn't even believe me they were in there since they had the same texture as the potato. The wine just turns it all to an amazing hand mashed texture. Other wines and different salts could change the taste a bit. So could stuffing in thin garlic slices. but it doesn't NEED improved. Tastes freaking AMAZING _",

It was a hit!  Next time, I will try a mandalin for thinner slices of onion, and melted butter.  I will be making this again, and so will the guests who asked for the recipe.  Oh!
