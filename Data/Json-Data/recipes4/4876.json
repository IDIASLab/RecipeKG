The green pepper and onion is not something we are a fan of with fish. I also did not use as much cheese because it would have been too much. Overall a good recipe and I think any veggies can be subbed in here to sneak them in for children. I also cut the fillets smaller about 2-3oz. each to make it more like a casserole.",
