I did that for my Christmas Cookie exchange on the iced pumpkin cookie recipe from this site (replacing this icing for that one). I baked the cookies in mini muffin tins instead of on cookie sheets and pressed the center down well right after they came out of the oven to make a nice sized indentation. I piped the icing into the hole and they looked so beautiful. They were the most popular cookie at the exchange and I received so many compliments on how they looked as well as how they tasted. And the best part is that piping is actually so much easier as well as faster than a regular icing method.",

I'll fess up to admit I left a few tablespoons in the bottom of the pan so I could enjoy dipping my fingers into it for a sweet treat. This one's a keeper.",

The icing has a nice browned butter flavor but the quantity is small as someone else noted. It was enough for a thin layer on a 9x13\" cake but definitely it should be doubled for a layer cake. I used it on a pecan cake since I liked the idea of butter pecan and it complimented it well.",
