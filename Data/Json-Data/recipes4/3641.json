My brother's girlfriend is vegan, has been for several years, and we always feel bad because we're a meat and potatoes family and don't now what we can really feed her. This turned out quite well. She described it as \"decadent\" and my brother had seconds and thirds. Leftovers were finished at dinner tonight. Definitely keeping this one in my recipe box!  My parents rated it as a 4. Put a little salt in the bottom half of the dish, and I think it really will earn that 5 star rating!",

I made a couple of minor adjustments, mostly just to speed it up. I subbed instant potatoes, prepared just according to package instructions (just easier). I also subbed a  whole bag of frozen peas and carrots (15 oz or so) rather than using the scant half cup of peas + fresh carrots. Like another reviewer, I forgot the tomato and just added some ketchup, along with about half a cup of veggie bouillion to keep it moist. I also added a generous squirt of Sriracha. It was delicious!!! My boyfriend, who converted to vegetarianism about a year ago, said it is one of his favorite dishes that I have made. Since I left out the mayo, cream cheese, and oil in the potatoes, and only used a splash of olive oil to saute the veggies in, this was also a very low fat dish. So much better than we ever expected it to be!!!! A definite keeper.",
