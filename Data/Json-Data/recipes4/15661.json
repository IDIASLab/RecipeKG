It is hearty, filling, and inexpensive not to mention extremely delicious and fairly easy to make. The hardest part and the most time-consuming part for this stew is preparing the vegetables. I chop and dice all my vegetables by hand and so it can consume a little bit more time, but it is very much worth the extra time it takes. Pork, beef, or venison are all good in this recipe, too.",

Plus this recipe sounded interesting and unlike any stew I had made. Sold!  I thought for sure this stew would end up bright red, but surprise! It didn't! The color actually kept getting lighter the longer it cooked and the beets turned a light color.  I made this exactly as written, except I added a couple bay leaves like the other reviewer suggested because I was afraid this would be bland. My only suggestion is to add some salt to taste. It was really necessary to bring out all the lovely vegetable flavors in this stew. It's VERY healthy and I don't feel guilty about having two servings. The best part - it's even better the next day! Keeper!!! Thanks for the great recipe BTheGusto!",

Per some other reviews I added a bay leaf and I added a dash of herbes de provence. I would absolutely make this again, delicious!",
