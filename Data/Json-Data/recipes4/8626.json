Made some changes because 1) didn't have everything called for 2) suggestions from other reviewers 3) needed to use up some things 4) we prefer robust flavors and 5) I'm ALWAYS short on time. I used some browned venison Italian sausage I always keep in the freezer for quick pizzas and to reduce fat. Likewise I cut butter in half and added 1/4 c. olive oil. Used about 1 tsp. rounded chicken bouillon powder since it is quicker than cubes less sodium and since I didn't have the extra fat to cook the cube. Used cider vinegar and added 2 very large cloves minced garlic. Sauteed briefly with the sausage and 8 oz. of mushrooms. Added 3/4 c. of the pasta water the green onion and about 3/4 lb. cubed zucchini and cooked just until squash began to soften then added 2 c. broccoli florets plus thinly sliced stems and about 3/4 - 1 c. thickly julienned red bell pepper. Mixed about 1 1/2 Tbsp. cornstarch and 1/4 c. water and added it to the rest to make it more \"saucey\". Cooked just until all vegetables were cooked crisp-tender and sauce was no longer watery. Served it over whole wheat pasta and sprinkled with some sliced black olives chopped fresh basil and crumbled feta cheese. Quick easy and devinely yummy.",

                "reviewBody": "Tried this recipe because I had Turkey sausage and zucchini and needed a supper dish everyone rated this one high so I tried it. I was very disappointed. Even with the addition of 4 cloves of minced garlic and some red pepper flakes this was just boring. It was not saucey enough to stick to the pasta and was very greasy. I might try to make a alfredo style sauce with these ingredients along with adding some cheeses just to be able to have a different style of sauce.",
