Also I made sure the pan was real hot when I put it in(I used a 9inch round cake pan). Also, I added about 5 minutes cooking time at the end, temp turned down to 350. \nOther than these temperature adjustments, all ingredients were the same, and the second day it turned out so much fluffier. Coming out of the pan- such a difference. Hopefully this helps others like me who don't get the rise they are looking for.",

That aside, I love these! My favorite way to make this is to peel and slice an apple, and spread the slices out on the bottom of the pan (I use a 9\" pyrex pie pan, melt the butter in it in the oven). Sprinkle the apple slices with a little cinnamon and nutmeg, then pour in the batter. After it's done baking, flip it out on a plate and serve. YUM! Oh, sidenote - bake it more like 1/2 hour at 400 and it won't be so custard-y, more like a cross between eggs and a pancake.",

I warmed the milk for 20 sec. in the microwave, and the eggs in a glass of hot tap water for about 2-3 minutes. I added about 1/4 tsp. vanilla, and still used a dash of nutmeg.  I baked this in a non-stick oven safe pan (calphalon) and it turned out beautifully! My daughter liked hers with maple syrup, I liked mine with just butter and powdered sugar.  For my husband, I sauteed some apple slices in a pan with butter, cinnamon, and a bit of brown sugar; then added apple juice and a bit of cornstarch and simmered until thick (a suggestion from another review).  This was a great topping too!! I will definitely make these many times again!",
