The only thing I changed was adding coconut oil instead of peanut oil in the sauce (which is healthier and added a very subtle coconut flavor to the already delicious sauce). The sauce is a little runnier than most peanut sauces I'm used to- it's definitely more of a vinaigrette I added a couple tsps of cornstarch and still found it a little runny- delicious over rice though! There is a pile of sauce left over... if you're just dipping the shrimp you could probably get away with halving it.. A couple of people have mentioned skipping the marinade... do NOT do this! The marinade is absolutely delicious with flavors of lemongrass garlic and ginger... I marinated mine about 45 mins and didn't wipe the chunks off the shrimp before grilling. My bf thought the shrimp was delicious and ate it on its own... I thought it complemented the flavors in the sauce wonderfully. Yum!",
