I also used my own turkey broth I made from our last roast turkey. She just loved it and so did I and I don't care for pea soup but this one was too good not to eat. I didn't put in all the chilli flakes as my little French girl dosn't like things to hot but the soup was sooooo good.I served it with a Johnny Cake I made and now I have a happy wife. I would not change anything except less chilli peppers. Thank you for the great recipe WileyP Wayne & Mona Nakusp British Columbia",
