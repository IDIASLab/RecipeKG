First, I toasted the spices (cumin, cardamom, coriander, cloves) and then used butter (since I didn't feel like making ghee) to saute the onions and garlic in. I crushed the spices and added them to the onions, along with curry powder. I used a home made yogurt, which is more tart than what you generally find in the store. I served it with an Indian-ish rice I tossed together. So I really liked this, but agree that it would have been better with fresh spinach, but I didn't have any on hand. I think that adding coconut milk to this (as another reviewer suggested) would be a little odd. ",

The chick peas I had were cooked dried chick peas (not canned) and I didn't have canned sweet peas so I microwaved frozen peas. I also substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth added some extra water and cooked longer than the recipe called for (based on one review I read and the fact that I wanted to put my daughter to bed before dinner). The result was delicious! For those who couldn't guess based on the amount of red pepper flakes called for this is fairly spicy. My husband and I ate it plain but others might want to serve it over basmati rice or with naan (as a number of reviewers recommend) or for those who really don't like spicy food reduce the amount of red pepper flakes.",

One alteration I made was to replace the vegetable oil with olive oil and combining that oil with the garlic red pepper flakes cumin and curry in a Tupperware container then shaking the chickpeas in the mixture and allowed it to set in the fridge for 3 days prior to making. This allowed the chickpeas to absorb all the spices and taste incredible! For the final product I replaced peas with chopped green bell pepper and sauteed it with the onion then added the chick pea mixture and served it over some thin spaghetti. It is always amazing.",
