And that's what I did with this one.  I liked the basic idea and just switched it up some, from others' reviews.  I used Italian seasoned Panko instead of the dressing mix.  I used parmesan & romano cheeses instead of Colby.  I used Italian seasoning instead of just thyme.  I did not precook the vegies.  Here's how it all went down:  \"pammed\" a 13 x 19 pan; layer of raw diced vegies, then layer of Panko, layer of cheeses; another layer of each, topped with a jar of pasta sauce.  Covered with foil, baked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  Removed foil, added more cheese, returned to oven for about 10 minutes, til cheese was melted and starting to brown.  This is one of the best dishes I have ever made!  Thanks to all, for your wonderful ideas!!",

I also recommend using half the stuffing called for in this recipe (or less) as the taste of the stuffing can completely overwhelm this dish; if you use flavored stuffing mix the vegetables just get lost. I might try it again by thinly slicing and layering the ingredients and using very minimal stuffing. I'd call this recipe only average.",

Also used Italian style stove top stuffing mix and added Italian seasonings to the vegetables when cooking. Added Montery Jack and parmesan cheese to the cheese mixture. Diced the vegetables fairly large and didn't cook quite as long as suggested didn't want them too soft. Was very flavorful and tasty.
