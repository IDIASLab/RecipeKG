I will probably saute the onions ahead of time so they are less crunchy and I get more flavor out of them.  Also, despite the sour cream and mayo, and only a 25 minute cook time, my casserole still ended up a little dry.  I will probably add a cup of chicken broth to the mix before topping it with cheese to give it just the right moisture level and taste.  Finally, an entire teaspoon of salt was far too much.  I cut that down to less than half a teaspoon without sacrificing flavor.",

I gave this one star, only because the crust was delicious.  The rest was very blah.  The casserole basically had no taste, the concept was good, I agree with the previous poster.  If you saut\u00e9ed the onions, garlic, mushrooms, celery and red pepper flakes they would be softer and meld the tastes together better.   I think the use of fresh mushrooms, and fresh green beans would have helped a lot.  I would also suggest a long grain rice instead of instant.  It kind of tasted like the rice box, very bland.  Also, because the potato chips have salt, I would have reduced the salt by at least half.  It also did not require monosodium glutamate.  Sorry, it just was not to our taste.",
