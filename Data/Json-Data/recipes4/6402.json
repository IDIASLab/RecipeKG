I used a fresh lime and didn't measure, just squeezed the juice from the whole thing into the soup.  Realized it provides a \"salt\" aspect which was good b/c I used low sodium chicken broth.  It was fast to make because I used boxes of Swanson chicken broth, chicken breast strips, pre-chopped celery and onion in a container from supermarket - and 3 of those little cups of Minute Rice (2 white and one medley) - very little work other than cubing the chicken, dicing carrots and microwaving the rice and putting everything together.  Cheating but it made a quick delicious meal.",
