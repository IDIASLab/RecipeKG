The bad news is that the person who created this recipe clearly likes almonds much more than they like chocolate. If you make these according to the recipe you re going to end up with blonde almond brownies with hardly any chocolate whatsoever. If that s your thing great; if not you re going to have to make some changes. Add a tablespoon of cocoa powder more chocolate chips and a packet of Splenda. Skip the almond extract entirely. I haven t tried substituting peanut butter for the almond butter but I expect it to be an improvement.",

I first subbed 1/2 cup of peanut butter and 1 tbsp vanilla extract, and added 1 tbsp of cocoa powder, granulated sugar to taste, and more mini chocolate chips. This version gave great peanut butter brownies with strong peanut butter flavor. \n\nI tried a second variation where I subbed just 1/4 cup of peanut butter and 1 tbsp vanilla extract, and added 1 tbsp of cocoa powder, extra mini chocolate chips, and no additional sugar. This  version made more chocolately tasting brownies. \n\nOne of my children preferred the peanut buttery version, and the other preferred the chocolatey version.\n\nI'm excited to try different nut butters (and even Nutella) and extracts to see which combination yields the best brownies.",
