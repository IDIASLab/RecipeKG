DON'T TRY IT WITHOUT REAL CHOPPED ONION BITS, BECAUSE YOU'RE MISSING OUT!\n\nThis recipe tastes absolutely amazing and juicy even with extra lean ground beef, but I suggest some minor modifications. \n\n1) I recommend using double the amount of ranch suggested in this recipe. Others have noted and I have found as well that it is difficult to taste without adding alot more.\n\n2) Don't use as much crackers, just buy leaner beef. The crackers are just filler and detract from the recipe and tend to dry out the meat. I suggest using about 1/2 to 3/4 of the suggested amount of saltines.",

I used a whole pack of Ranch dressing mix and instead of raw onion I used 1/2 pack of onion soup mix. I used Italian bread crumbs in place of cracker crumbs. Very much full of flavor and moist. I made it in the morning and grilled for dinner. The flavor really goes thru. I made a batch this morning and cant wait for dinner tonight! This is a keeper for us!",

I used the Dry Ranch Dressing mix from this site (minus the salt and adding dill) and crushed Ritz crackers instead of saltines. I served them up with a nice sharp cheddar and slices of tomato. EDITED: These are NOT gross. I make these at least once every couple months in a variety of ways. One of my favorite ways to make it is serve it with a doctored up cream-of-mushroom soup gravy and fluffy mashed potatoes. My family LOVES it. This also works with ground turkey or ground chicken. I highly suggest making your own homemade ranch dressing mix if you can. It makes it SO much better.",

I used 1 lb. of 85/15 ground beef and added 1 tsp. of dried minced onion and 1/2 tsp. of onion powder. There really was no need for the egg or cracker/bread crumbs. These came out very moist.
