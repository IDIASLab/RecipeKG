I am an experienced baker and I just couldn't get this to come together by hand with a pastry blender and didn't want to add more moisture. So after working it by hand for a while and still having a lot of crumb I threw it in the mixer bowl on medium speed for less than 30 seconds and it came together. I was a total idiot and forgot the coconut for the filling as I was making these (that's what you get for baking Christmas cookies for 14 hours straight) and I think I would have appreciated the viscosity it would have added to the filling. I sealed my edges TIGHTLY and still I had some leakage with some of the cookies. However they are very tasty and they're lovely to boot. A very nice addition to my cookie trays and I will make them again next year WITH the coconut!",
