I found this and wanted to try cause we don't care for the sweet cornbread. I only had one type of cornmeal so I combined the measurements for that. I also used more oil instead of the lard and I used a second egg. I didn't use the optional items either. The one thing I did do was add a pinch of sugar (at most 1/8 of a teaspoon). I remember Mom always did that and she said it \"softens\" the taste without making it sweet. The batter was a little thicker than I'm used to so you may want to back down the flour or meal or add a little more buttermilk. I baked it a little longer cause I use a smaller iron skillet maybe 7-8 inch. Once the top started to Brown I removed it. The bottom didn't burn either. I do have to say the cornbread was one of the best I've had in a long time maybe even ever. It was dense but that was the flour. I am definitely keeping this one.",
