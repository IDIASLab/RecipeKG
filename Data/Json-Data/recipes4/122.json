Several steps can be completed the nite before - cooking/cubing the chicken, cooking the rice, etc.  I've found that the key is to learn how to cook wild rice first - I always use 4 cups of water to one cup wild rice with a tsp of salt and boil it for approx. 40-50 minutes.  Then I divide it into to large baggies of 2 cups each, which can be frozen for later use.  I added 8 slices of cooked and crumbled bacon, substituted garlic salt for the salt, and ommitted the curry and mustard powders.  I also used 3 cups of cooked wild rice instead of two.  A GREAT recipe that I will use again.",

Suggestion:  Double the Curry.  This ingredient sounded strange to me when I first looked at the recipe, but believe me it's the *KEY* to this soup.   Well any type of chicken based soup, so I'm told.   Who would have ever thought Curry makes chicken soup more \"chickeny\"!!   Enjoy, it's awesome.",

I used a quarter of the butter called for in this recipe and added in just a little extra virgin olive oil to keep the butter from scorching. I did double the mushrooms and I added in quite a bit of fresh minced garlic. I did not need the flour or the salt. I used all organic chicken broth. To cut back on the fat, I used 1/3 cup fat free half-n-half and that was all I needed to make this a creamy soup plus it made it thicker without needing the flour. I did not add the mustard powder as I didn't have any. This is very good, though after tasting it, I did add in more curry powder. The almonds were just right in this soup, just wonderful. I would have never thought of that.",

I baked the boneless, skinless chicken breasts (brushed with extra-virgin olive oil, sprinkled with marjoram, thyme, oregano, a little salt & pepper, then baked at 450 for 30-35 min.)  Turned out great!  This is definitely a keeper!  I even sent a copy of your fabulous recipe to my mother (a native Minnesotan from Hibbing).  Thanks!",

So, against my better judgement, I watched the vegetables swim, not saute, in a stick of butter. And then I winced a little as I added the entire 3/4 cup of flour. I tasted it after seasoning it with the curry and mustard powder which I not only found odd, but unpleasant. After stirring in the almonds I discovered I didn't care for that either. Finally, to this thick concoction I added the prescribed pint of half-and-half. Rather than hearty, creamy and satisfying, I found this excessively thick and floury with a flavor that didn't seem quite appropriate for a chicken wild rice soup.",

Okay the first time...I used the crockpot. After much online research I sauted the onions celery and carrots mushrooms and then added the flour and the chicken broth. Then I put this mix and the rest of the ingredients (except the half and half) in my crockpot on low for 8 hours (I added the half and half the last hour). I used a can of cooked wild rice soup by the way. THIS is the way you do it if you want to use a crockpot. The second time I made this per another poster's advice I was lazy and put EVERYTHING in the crockpot for 8 hours (added the half and half the last hour). Bad idea! It was very watery the carrots and the celery were hard (even after 8 hours!) and the soup was bland. Anyway this is the BEST wild rice soup recipe ever! I will definitely make it again the way I made it the first time. I just have to saute the veggies before crockpotting them. YUM!!!",
