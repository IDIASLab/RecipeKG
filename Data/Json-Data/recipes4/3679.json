Please use less vinegar to start with, since some vinegars are stronger than others, and then if you are a vinegar freak like me, add more :] Cheers! ",

My only changes were to reduce the vinegar - I probably used 3 1/2 tbsp. or so, just added a little at a time and kept tasting, then at the end I probably ended up drizzling in 1/4 cup of olive oil.   Had a little with some toasted baguette and crackers, and then on top of pasta for dinner.  Just delicious!  I think next time I'll try pulsing the almonds first, though, as my food processor is old and tired and I ended up finding a couple large chunks.    I really didn't want to blend the sauce any further as it was just the right texture.",

I used 1 1/2 bell peppers added a few more tomatoes included 2 shallots sub'd basil oil for the olive oil and sub'd spicy balsamic vinegar and a little rice wine vinegar (didn't have red wine vinegar).

Now I have to push back dinner because I keep eating this! So you say this gets better after sitting? I'm in trouble I'm cooking only for myself and thought I'd have a bunch for the freezer. Kept to the recipe except for being heavy-handed with the pepper flakes and paprika (used sweet Hungarian my Spanish paprika is smoked maybe I'll try that next time since I bet that goes with the roasty goodness). I did end up using the entire amount of vinegar it was perfect for me. I think some brands are more sharp and others more smooth so I bet that makes a difference. I asked in the Recipe Exchange if the garlic should be peeled before or after roasting and the submitter herself answered (also Rhianna) within just a few minutes that peeling before hand works better but either way is okay. I used parchment instead of foil on the baking pan and got perfect consistency with a food processor. Just got a great idea since I have more baguette to use up: Make a pizza-type thing with baguette sliced horizontally and toasted topped with romesco then olives artichoke hearts and parmesan! I know what is for lunch (okay maybe breakfast) tomorrow. Thanks Angie this is one of the best things I've tried in a long time.",

Didn't roast the garlic but it was fine raw (if you like that sort of thing) and didn't have tomatoes so I used some leftover marinara sauce and leftover dried bread crumbs instead of stale bread. I used two red bell peppers and one fresh pasilla pepper roasted. I used regular paprika because it's all I had and less olive oil than called for. I love the versatility of this sauce!
