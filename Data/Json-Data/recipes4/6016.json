I mixed the dry ingredients in a large bowl and then tossed the beef cubes in it. Placed them in the slow cooker, layered the sliced onions, and topped it with the tomatoes. Couldn't have been easier. I did use 1 Tbsp. of paprika, as my original recipe calls for  a lot. Served on hot egg noodles, with a side of kale. A hearty and tasty winter meal. Thanks for sharing!",

                "reviewBody": "I would give this recipe 4.5 stars if I could.  I think it's a really good base for an even better goulash.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated, with the addition of some fresh carrots, celery and leaves, parsley, and oregano (partly for texture and added veggies, and partly because these were things that I needed to use up in my fridge :D).  I added the carrots and celery in with the beef and onion, and coated all of that with the flour mixer, and then mixed everything else in and give it a light stir.  I also used smoked paprika, just for a little something different.  The recipe, with the addition of the few things I added, was just enough \"sauce\" for one pound of pasta, which is approx. 4c of dry elbow macaroni.  Unless you are really trying to stretch this meal, I think 7c of pasta (as listed in the original ingredient list) is a little excessive; but you could always add more liquid to create a thinner \"sauce\".  We preferred the thickness of the sauce just as it was once the sour cream was added in, it was perfect for us.  Also, I cooked this on high for 5hrs (stirring it once during that time), then after 5hrs added the sour cream and let it cook on high for another 30min, then turned it off with the lid on for another 30min or so.  This was a really easy meal that I was able to let cook in the crock pot all day on Sunday while I did my cleaning.  Thanks!",
