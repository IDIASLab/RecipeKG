While this particular recipe smelled and tasted different than the Kabsa I have had (I know there are many variations to Kabsa, much like the Spanish Paella), it was still good.  I do think that the broth used to cook the rice needs more chicken flavor, even after boiling the chicken in it, so next time I would add some boullion.  I used 2-3 times more chicken than this recipe called for, and it still seemed like a lot of rice in comparison to the chicken.  P.S. My 2.5-year-old daughter ate this dish without hesitation!  I think the raisins won her over :)",

This is exactly the flavor my friend from Lebanon would make in her rice chicken dish. I never knew the name of until now. This will be a regular and next time I will make the chicken with it. I had already put together Chef John's chicken kabobs for dinner today. One note-be sure to check the package of your rice for cooking times. Mine was only 20 minutes and thankfully I checked it before it turned mushy! Thank you for a great recipe. I made the 7 spice Baharat to use next time:) Update 9/16- Tonight I made the chicken and it was great. We all loved it. I fry my rice along with the onion for several minutes before adding the chicken broth. Then I cooked it for 10 minutes. I kept having a mushy rice problem until I did this. The seasonings in this recipe were perfect!",
