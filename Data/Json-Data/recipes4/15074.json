The curry paste and the spaghetti sauce are a nice touch which were both homemade and it may have been why there was so much sweetness. Maybe a splash of vinegar at the end would tone it down a bit. At first it seemed the soup would be very thin almost watery but once I added the spaghetti sauce it thickened up and turned into a hearty lentil soup. I soaked the lentils for two hours and cooked everything in a pressure cooker for 10 minutes. The lentils were a bit more than al dente whole and not mushy but soft enough not to crunch. Thank you lw for sharing this recipe.",
