Modified by reducing to 1 bag of frozen peas & carrots instead of canned adding 2 ribs of sliced celery just prior to baking adding 1 cup of small diced Yukon gold potatoes (blanched) & adding 1/2 TBSP of cayenne pepper to the filling. Per other reviewers' suggestions we added the bottom crust too. Lightly brushed the top crust with egg beaters and it turned out beautifully!",
