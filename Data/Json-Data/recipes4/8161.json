                "reviewBody": "I'm assuming the 80 servings is supposed to read 8. That being said I halved the recipe with 4 servings in mind. I really liked this but wanted to mention a couple of things. One egg per pound of shrimp is plenty so save yourself some eggs. Step 7 says to test your shrimp but doesn't state how to do that. Eating under cooked shrimp would not be a good idea however 5 minutes in hot enough oil is plenty and there is no need for testing. Lastly I found that the breading set on the shrimp just fine and didn't really need the 30 minutes refrigerating time. The end results was great but I think you can save yourself some time and money with the things I suggested.",
