        "description": "This is so easy and fast to make, and tastes amazing! Even my carnivorous boyfriend loves it. Serve cold as a mid-day salad, as a side dish, or serve warm as the main course. The thing I love most about this meal is its versatility. This is how I usually make it, but I just came up with it one day when wanting a quinoa, black bean, and corn recipe. Feel free to change to suit your preferences! I make it cheater-style with salsa, but it can easily be made with fresh or cooked veggies of your choice. It can be a cool summer salad, or a hearty warm winter dinner by the fire. This is the first of my recipes that I have shared.",
