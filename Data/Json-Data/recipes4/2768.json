                "reviewBody": "Folks if you're having a problem getting the eggs cooked enough it's because this is not prepared like a real frittata which is started out in a skillet. Your pumpkin (4 cups is too much for 8 eggs)and potato and onion should be sauteed (separately of course) then the eggs poured in and cheese added cook till the bottom is set then place in hot oven or under broiler. Sauteeing the veg will add so much more flavor to the pan than pre-cooking in a microwave (yuk); and in a good skillet I have never had a frittata stick. This way it cooks in a lot less time and you don't have a bunch of bowls to wash--just one skillet. Also for any dish to be flavorful and not one dimensional you must season each component--not just the final conglomeration.",

So thank you for launch idea on a wonderful not-so-usual brunch this morning. I substituted baked sweet potato (already on hand) for both pumpkin and potato added raw pistachios and some salt/generous black pepper served with side of steamed carrot greens (I like slight bitter with my sweet). I baked it using cast iron as I usually do with an egg dish. It was wonderful; my husband however ate all of it so there's no leftovers to try it cold.",

I still have some tweaking to do before it's 5 star worthy but I think it just needs a bit more butternut than I added and maybe a little more salt...great as is though...can't wait to make it for my bf...he'll love it!",
