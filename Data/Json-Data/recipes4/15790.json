I used canned black-eyed peas instead of dried frozen greens instead of fresh and grape tomatoes instead of the regular sized ones. I also used potatoes instead of turnips because I had no turnips. (I used what I had in the house.) This is really a good recipe! I followed your instructions except for the dried bean part. The vinaigrette dressing added just the right sweet and acid for the greens. I did add a little red pepper to mine because I like red pepper in greens but this was a super recipe without it! By the way using the canned peas my dish was done in about 20 minutes.",
