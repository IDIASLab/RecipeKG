I save it and use it in the summer when beans are freshest. Then we always have something to look forward to each summer.  I often double this recipe just to have enough for my children to have leftovers! You can prepare this ahead of time, but make sure that the casserole is at room temperature before baking. I often use a mixture of both green beans and wax beans in the casserole.",
