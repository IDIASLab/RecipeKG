I sauted the onion garlic and mushrooms in about 2 tbsp. of olive oil instead of butter and made the whole thing on my stovetop! It was infused with so much flavor and the barley had a really nice chewieness to it. You can substitute rice for the barley - but I like using barely as it is a more complex grain than rice. I will definitely come back to this recipe over and over again! Thanx SunnyByrd! (By the way I love your pics! I'm a big fan of yours! Keep the great recipes - and photo shots coming!!!)",

After 45 min I still had a lot of liquid left (still learning to adjust for altitude) so I simmered it the rest of the way on the stove. This will be a great winter dish--next time I'll make it in the slow cooker and use hulled barley (which takes forever to cook but is a more complete grain and therefore higher in nutrients).",
