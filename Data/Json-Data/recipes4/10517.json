I used it on a double crust Chicken Pot Pie It turned out beautiful it was flakey and melted in our mouths. I don't think that I would choose this for a 'sweet' pie but definately will be using it again for meat pies. I didn't have any plastic wrap so I stored the pieces all together in a tupperware container and they were just fine. I rolled them out on my counter top sprinkled in flour and folded them twice to transfer them to the pie plates and it worked beautifully for me. As I said this was my first attempt at a home made crust so I didn't flute the edges perfectly but it still came out of the oven looking pretty. I baked the pie at 450 for about 25 minutes I usually have to bake them for 35... so keep an eye on your pies as this dough seemed to bake a little faster than normal.",
