Lots of leftover sauce (no pork though); my mom even wanted to take some of the sauce home and find some other meat to soak in it.  Easy and delicious.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe except that I browned the meat the day before and put it in it's baking dish covered overnight in the fridge.  I also made the sauce the day before in a separate container and poured it over the meat just before putting it in the oven. Try it. You won't be disappointed.",

I used maple syrup because at the last minute I discovered I didn't have any honey.  I cut that back to 1/2 a cup but I think 1/4 of a cup would be plenty using either honey or maple syrup.  I found the sauce too sweet to be pouring over the meat once everything was on the dinner table.  I will be making this again.  I didn't have Russian Dressing so I made it following the recipe Chilled Russian Salad Dressing from this sight.  Thanks for sharing.",
