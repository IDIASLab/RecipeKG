Nevertheless it is very healthy and can be easily modified according to personal preference. If no fresh tomatoes are available, use a tbsp of tomato paste. If you like olive oil then sautee onions in it before adding the rest of the ingredients. Olive oil and a dash of lemon juice adds a nice finishing touch too. More people should try this recipe.",

I did not puree but my split lentils got soft enough it was almost like a puree after extending the cooking time by 20 min. I also added chopped Kale (large stems removed) the last 15 minutes. Before serving I stirred in 2 Tbsp lemon juice and garnished with a handful of cilantro as other reviewers suggested. The soup was good but it lacked rich flavor so next time I will use Chicken Broth in place of water as most others have. Very healthy!",
