A couple small tweaks.\" I was doubtful of putting that many \"special\" veggies all together, thinking their flavors would compete w/ one another, but it turned out to be a lovely dish. I didn't have quite as many mushrooms, and I had to sub hearts of palm for the artichoke hearts (close enough); I also added a handful of diced onion to the initial saute. Otherwise I was completely faithful to the recipe and was pleasantly surprised w/ the end result. When I make this again, I plan to increase the spinach, and stir a bit of the pasta water into the chick/vegg mixture for additional moisture b/c it was a bit dry. (Or instead of just tossing the linguine w/ the pesto, split the pesto into the chicken/vegg too.)",

I added finely diced red bell peppers diced tomatoes and mushrooms in with the same pan I had cooked the chicken and garlic in and fried it for a few minutes until fragrant. I wanted the excess water of the tomatoes out so I kept the stove on high until all the water evaporated and stirred occasionally. I added the spinach at the end and it turned out to be amazing! Also I took one cup of heavy cream and heated it on the stove until it was reduced to half and then mixed it with the pesto it was the perfect pesto cream sauce! I mixed the pesto cream sauce with the linguini and topped it off with the chicken mixture it looked and tasted absolutley amazing!!",

I doubled the recipe so that we'd have leftovers for hubbies lunch. Followed recipe, but cut back on artichokes a little (not hubbies favorite :) and minced three large cloves of garlic - less than called for. Next time I'll add more mushrooms, called for amount of artichokes and garlic, and add extra spinach - maybe 50% more. I used FOUR chicken breast halves. Sauteed them in HOT olive oil/butter mix until well browned. Then removed from pan while sauteeing mushrooms (and I added red onion). Then sliced chicken breasts and let everything simmer on lowest heat while I cooked pasta. Then added spinach and pesto. Chicken was slightly undercooked when I sliced; perfectly cooked and tender after simmering. Even my slightly picky, older guests loved this and asked for seconds. Definitely a keeper - Thank you ChezCristy!!",
