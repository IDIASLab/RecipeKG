I had a container of sweetened frozen strawberries that I wanted to use, so I thawed them out, drained the juice into a container and used the strawberry liquid instead of the water.  It really added a punch of flavor!   I also used a basic cream cheese frosting (because we all love cream cheese so much) and added about a cup of the frozen strawberries to the frosting and mixed it well.  Delish!  The end product tasted a lot like strawberry shortcake.  This recipe is a keeper!",
