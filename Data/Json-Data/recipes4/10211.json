I added water and chicken soup mix (I did not have chicken broth) and put it in an aluminum pan covered with silver foil on 325 for 2 hours, and then on 375 for about 20 minutes to make it crispy.

I started by rubbing the inside & out of the skin with butter and then with a basting brush I painted on a nice coat of extra virgin olive oil. I used diced red potatoes half a bag of peeled baby carrots half of a yellow onion (fine diced) and about a cup of chopped celery. I added only about a cup of water since I wanted more of the chicken juices to cook into the vegetables. Cooked my 4lb bird on 350 for 2 hours covered basting about every 30 minutes then cooked uncovered at 400 for another hour. DELICIOUS. ROSEMARY is a must with this recipe the taste is absolutely devine. I also used garlic salt onion salt thyme basil and fresh ground pepper...mmmm! We will definitely be making this a regular meal in our home!",
