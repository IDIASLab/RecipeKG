I made my own tomato sauce and couldn't be bothered to get the frying pan out so I skipped the onions and put the peppers on fresh. They were still nice and crunchy when it came out and that's how I prefer my vegetables. The flavours went really well with polenta and the 2 of us gobbled the whole thing up for lunch (I don't think you could feed six people with this). My only negative remark is that the name 'pizza' and the accompanying picture which is clearly of a regular pizza are a little misleading. The 'crust' comes out soft and soggy the same texture as warm polenta. I meant to take a photo of it for this site but I didn't quite manage to take the slices out in one piece so I gave up on that. Anyway if you don't expect to get a 'pizza' out of this you'll really enjoy it. My boyfriend rated it 5 stars and was happy there was little washing up (especially with the frying stage skipped). I'll make this again but probably won't ever serve it to company because of the sogginess. Thanks a lot for the recipe.",
