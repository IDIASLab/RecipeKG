Well, lets just say I could not keep my husband from dipping into the crock pot over and over again before it was time for dinner. This was really wonderful! I did make two changes though. Instead of using plain diced tomatoes, I used diced tomatoes with green chilis. I also chopped up a small onion and put it into the mix. I gave this recipe 5 stars because I think it would have been wonderful without the changes I made, we just like our food with a little bit of a \"bite\" to it. Not only was this meal yummy, but very economical as well. I served with warm crusty bread and a big salad and I was able to feed my family of 5 for under $10.00, with leftovers to boot. Thank you so much, I will be making again for sure!",

(but IS filling! :) We like some spice & flavor so I used 1 can of Ro-tel (tomatoes & green chilis) instead of plain tomatoes & did NOT drain the can. I like carrots so I added 3 large ones cut into 1 inch chunks & more celery too - fyi veggies tend to dissolve in slow cookers so the larger pieces do fine with longer/all day cook times. Mine was ready in 5 hrs on high in  a crock pot (used small brown lentils). When I am cooking it while at work all day, I'll add large/regular lentils and leave pot on low for 8-9 hours. This recipe is so high in protein & fiber, is easy & inexpensive to make - what more do you need in a recipe?! Thanks a million Tanya!\r\nOops - forgot to say I added 1/2 large onion, chopped, and 2tsp fresh minced garlic! Don't forget it - it makes a difference!",
