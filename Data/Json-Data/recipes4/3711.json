However after everything was assembled in the casserole dish I realized the recipe never stated when to add the parmesan cheese. So I sprinkled it on top since I didn t have any other options at that point. However I am pretty sure it is suppose to be added with the cream to make the sauce more of an alfredo type sauce. Oh well I hope this helps. This dish had good flavors but I probably won t make again.",

It turned out absolutely fabulous and I will definitely make it again. Though it's a little high in fat it's a very delicious recipe.",
