I made it with chicken breasts, which he prefers, and on the stovetop (just simmer for 15-20 minutes once you have everything together) and it came out great.  I agree with many others -- a little bland when made as is.  But add these two things and you will have a more authentic flavor: 1/4 tsp. red chili powder & 1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi).",

This one is right on the money!  I found all the spices at Whole Foods. I truly believe that the quality of spices is part of what makes the dish. Curry paste can be hard to find but you can find the Red Curry Paste Thai Kitchen Brand in the ethnic food aisle of any super market.  I used non fat plain yogurt and low fat coconut milk. It still had a hearty texture to it, but with less fat and calories!   I mixed the spices separately together in a small cup before I spread it over the chicken,  this allowed the flavors to blend.   I am definitely adding this to my weekly menu!",

Doubled recipe (my family LOVES butter chicken). Considering the other reviews, I only used half the amount of tomato paste and it was not at all too \"tomatoey\" but just right. I stupidly made a mistake and did not double the cardamom pods (it would have made it even better). I did add an equal amount of fresh ginger as garlic.  Rather than just mincing the garlic, I used my food processor (small bowl) and ground the garlic and ginger into a paste as that is usually what is called for in Indian recipes.  Added this at the very end of the cooking of the onion and chicken. I used Greek yogurt rather than regular - 0% fat and makes it creamier.  Lastly, although the recipe suggests adding the yogurt before cooking, I have done so in other recipes and yogurt and other dairy is likely to curdle in the crock pot. I added it right before serving.  It really pushed the dish over the top.  My family hasn't stopped raving.  They said it was better than our favorite restaurant's.",

I love the ease of a crock pot, so I didn't Pre-cook the onion since 1) it means I'm defeating the purpose of the crock pot, giving me another item to wash, and 2) the onion will cook in the hot liquid in the pot anyways.  I cannot imagine it made much of a difference in the flavor, if any at all.  I mixed all the ingredients, except the chicken, together in the crock pot, then added the chicken, and stirred to coat the chicken.  To me crock pots are meant to be a 1 step cooking method :)",

I added a chopped tomato instead of canned tomato paste as I am avoiding any canned tomato product.  I also only used 10 cardamom pods - it was still pretty heavy on the cardamom.

                "reviewBody": "I tried to write this review w/o a star rating because I changed the recipe, but wasn't able to. Because I don't think those two ingredients (cardamom & tomato paste) could have made enough difference I gave it 3*. I didn't have cardamom and I didn't want to use the tomato paste because I don't like it. I doubled the recipe and after cooking it in the crockpot the chicken was dry and the sauce was bland which is strange considering there's several spices, so I added 3 chopped tomatoes, 2 large cans of whole tomatoes which I blended, one chicken cube, extra yogurt, and cayenne pepper for a little kick. Was definitely better. This might be better if made on the stove so the chicken doesn't dry out. Hope this helps.",
