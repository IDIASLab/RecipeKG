I make all of this in an oven-proof skillet, so when I finish the saute, I just put the whole thing in the oven to finish.  Increase curry to 2 tsp, add 1/2 tsp cumin, omit parmesean cheese, use olive oil in place of butter, cut chicken into 1-2 inch pieces, add potatoes cut into 1-2 inch pieces (boil first for 10 minutes). And I bake it for 30 minutes at 350, make sure to let the dish sit for at least 10 minutes before serving -it all settles very nicely that way, seems to be creamier that way. Sometimes I add some dried parsely to it just to give it an \"herb\" look.  Very tasty!!",

I sauteed the onions and added some chopped green pepper in a skillet with olive oil instead of butter and in a separate dutch oven I cooked cubed chicken breast with salt and pepper and olive oil. In a separate saucepan I put chopped canned tomatoes tomato paste 1 bottle of beer and all the spices (extra curry and cumin!). I added the onion/peppers to the chicken and poured the sauce & spices over and simmered for about 15-20 min. I have a microwaveable rice cooker so I partially cooked the rice and then added it to the tomato and chicken mixture and simmered for another 10 minutes. Sooo delicious!

The only taste-affecting variable I can think of to blame for such negative results (when everyone else seemed to have positive ones!) would be the type of beer used... but to be honest I was so yucked out by this that I wouldn't try it again regardless.

I browned the chicken with the onions in a large suace pan then poured in 6 oz beer with 1 can crushed and 1 can diced tomatoes. I then stirred in 3 tsp curry 1/2 tsp cumin cayenne garlic powder salt and 1 tsp basil. When the chicken was almost cooked through I threw in some pre-cooked cubed potatoes and cauliflower let it all simmer and right before I took it off heat a few dashes of cream to balance out the tartness of the tomatoes. YUM! Total hit =) I took away one star because of all the changes but the basic recipe is great - very easy to make.",
