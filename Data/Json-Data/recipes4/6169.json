I also used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  I added a healthy bit of dried minced onion.  The end result was very good and I would make this again.  I made the mistake of starting the boiling of the potatoes too late for dinner so they didn't get quite done and I had to cut them up while still hot but that was my fault.  I also did not put cheese on top of the potatoes, just dumped all of it in the mix.  I think they would benefit from some bread crumbs, preferably Panko, on top but again that is personal preference.  Thanks!",
