I used a pound of Bob Evans italian sausage and a ring of Oscar Meyer selects italian herb \"kielbasa style\" sausage (I sliced it).  I only had one can of crushed tomatoes, and since I doubled the recipe, I added a few fresh sliced tomatoes.  I also threw in a little garlic, oregano, and basil.  Super GREAT meal, and I my men loved it!  Cheers to the recipe contributor!",
