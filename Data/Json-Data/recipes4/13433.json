There are a lot of potent ingredients going on here with the curry, turmeric, cayenne, and sesame oil. They all seemed to be fighting to steal the show with curry coming in as the winner.  It completely overwhelmed to the point it gave the shrimp a bitter taste. I think this recipe has potential but the spices need scaled way back and I do mean WAY back.",
