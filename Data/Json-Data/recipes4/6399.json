                "reviewBody": "My family accepts new dishes which makes for enjoying unusual recipes. I was dying to try the pork/curry/feta combination. For 1# of pork I got six smaller burgers. I wanted to start on the mild side so I used 2 Tbl of Thai green curry and used a ginger grater to 'mince' the ginger and garlic. Had no time to fire up the grill so I pan fried them. That was a mistake as the feta melted and stuck to the pan. I served them on above-average sandwich buns with rice and a stir-fry of onion patty pan squash carrots & sweet pepper. Everyone raved even my wife who isn't a big fan of pork. I'll be making it again soon & try it with red curry paste on the grill or broil them. Thank you WDawn for a truly refreshing recipe!-----Jimny",

Found this recipe and was intrigued. Never would have thought of combining pork curry and feta. Based on the other reviews--like me another reviewer made his first review about this item though I've used Allrecipes for years--I had to sign up to say DELICIOUS. \"Boy we gobbled those down!\" said my husband. He wants these to be in regular rotation. I subbed home-made curry powder for the paste and the cilantro turned out to be past its prime so I didn't use that but will next time--for there will definitely be a next time! Thank you for this great recipe WDawn!",

I used ground turkey instead of ground pork and I think that worked just fine. I used Thai red curry paste and when I tasted the paste it lacked the curry flavor I wanted so I added curry powder (a couple of teaspoons?) but would add more next time. I had to use ground ginger in a tube as I had no fresh. Though I used less than the suggested substitution rate the burgers ended up with a bit too much ginger flavor for me. Keep that in mind should you need to use this substitution. Finally I left out cilantro because I cannot abide it. If you grill these burgers you may want to keep the heat lower than you usually do. The cheese and curry paste caremalizes on the outside quite quickly. Still I will try this again with less paste more curry powder and fresh ginger. Well worth another try.",
