I also use Sargento provolone/mozzarella slices (I break the piece in half and then lay the cheese in the zucchini boats they fit perfectly). I hope you all enjoy this recipe as much as our family.",

I cut the recipe in half, instead of rice I used 1/2 cup Quinoa cooked in chicken broth. Used a whole can of tomato sauce (15 oz) and mix Mozzarella in with the mix. I didn't have provolone. When sauteing the veggies I also added mushrooms. After I filled the zucchini with the meat and veggie mixture I added more shredded mozzarella and parmesan. I the topped it off with a can of Italian diced tomatoes. It made a lot of sauce and was so good. Thanks cookinmama for the great recipe.",
