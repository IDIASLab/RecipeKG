The small shells are the perfect size for this. The only change I made was to use 2 tsp. dried dill because I didn't have fresh dill on hand. The quantities of the ingredients are right on except for the tuna. I used 1 - 5oz. can of Tuna (nowadays Tuna cans are only 5 oz. not 6) but it wasn't enough. Even a 6 oz can isn't enough for all the veggies and pasta. Next time I will use 2 cans of Tuna and fresh dill.",
