To make it super healthy I use whole-wheat flour tortillas. And it still tastes just as delicious!",

I halved and butterflied two giant chicken breasts, added S&P, cooked on a grill pan and minced the chicken. I pre-cooked the onion and peppers before adding anything else (about double the peppers), and used diced hot cherry pepper instead of red (just one).   I used fat-free yogurt in place of sour cream, added a can of diced tomatoes instead of sauce, added 1/4 salsa, and added 2 tsp. cumin, 1/4 cup taco seasoning and exchanged cilantro for oregano, and used white beans instead of black.  As with any dish like this I cooked the filling for about 20 minutes.  I used whole wheat tortillas and only used enough taco sauce to cover the enchiladas (maybe 1/3 cup).  I only had 4 tortillas, so the rest of the filling is...dare I say, delicious chicken chili??",
