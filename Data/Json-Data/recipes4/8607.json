I was a little confused about the sausage I am not 100% sure what the chef's intentions were since we were dealing two type of sausage and it was never made clear if there was a different processes for them so I de-cased the Sweet Italian sausage and added that when called for. I Browned the Pork Sausage links par cooked them then added them with the meatballs to the sauce. The Meatballs were flavorful and the sauce was good I added more cinnamon than called for and won't be doing that again. Very good one stop recipe that will please.",
