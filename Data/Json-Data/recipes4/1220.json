When I was in Nepal a year ago, I watched someone make this recipe, only minus the cilantro (a delicious variation!) and I think with some red pepper.\n\nTo make the flavor go all the way through the potatoes, she simply fried cut raw potatoes with the spices, and at least 4 Tbls of oil, for about 5 minutes and then added water and then pressure cooked everything together.  The flavor went all the way through the potatoes!  I have done this with just a covered pot and let it cook longer.  \n\nGlad this great dish is on the site!",

They are great hot and at room temperature - and what little was left I ended up noshing on cold for a snack the next day.",

I cut the potatoes first and then boiled them. I also used half of the turmeric powder. Once the potatoes were done I drained them and added one bullion cube and 1 can of evaporated milk (could have also used a can of coconut milk but didn't have any) to them. Then mixed the spices with the dish and added salt to taste. I also loved the cilantro it was a subtle yet great twist!",
