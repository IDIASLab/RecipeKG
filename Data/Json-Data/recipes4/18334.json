You don't need to use dashi broth but it is a good addition.  But, check to see if you can find dashi broth that does not have MSG.  Dashi can be made at home with konbu (kelp) but don't let it boil or it will get like gel.  Bonita (tuna) flakes and firm to medium firm tofu are delicious additions to this kind of ramen recipe with a sprinkle of the minced scallion (green part only).",

I added some red flakes and cayenne pepper because I knew it was going to be too sweet. It was not so sweet to the point that it's bad but the syrup is pretty potent. I would recommend putting even less syrup than is called for. Nonetheless I finished the whole bowl and personally really enjoyed it. I will probably be making it again because it's better than plain old ramen.",
