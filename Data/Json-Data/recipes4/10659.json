I made this recipe before & caught that mistake the last time, but...this time I was in a hurry & guess what? Poured in the whole amount of seas. salt..oh,yuck! Realized what I did as soon as I poured it in. I didn't want to pitch the whole thing so I tried adding a couple of peeled potatoes to it (supposed to absorb some of the saltiness...it didn't). I was talking to my sister & she suggested pouring all the broth out (just discard it) but not the meat,bacon or veggies & then rinsing all that off & starting over with more broth...it worked!! Only this time, I didn't use any salt at all & cut back on the Worcestershire sauce by 1/2. Perfect! It's a very good recipe if you don't screw it up :)",

I used thin sliced round steak which tenderized nicely with the lengthy simmering only 3 slices bacon and lowfat sour cream and only a little more than half the amount called for. To cut down on the salt I used low salt beef broth and omitted the seasoned salt alltogether...2 tablespoons is a HUGE amount! I substituted Mrs. Dash garlic and herb blend and added no additional salt. So..minor changes for health reasons and still this had EXCELLENT flavor. I only cook with fresh mushrooms so I used 8oz. of those. Thanks for posting...this truly was the best stroganoff I have ever made. Family loved it!",

The flour at this point thickened the sauce beautifully later in the dish and eliminated the need for cornstarch. Completely left out the seasoning salt and tweaked the spices some, such as adding minced garlic and salt & fresh ground pepper to the bacon, celery and onions while cooking. Also added a little extra dash of worcestershire sauce after adding the fresh mushrooms. Served over egg noodles garnished with some shaved Parmesan Cheese with fresh green beans and seasoned tomato wedges. Made a very nice dinner.",

I used good round steak threw the cut up chunks in a plastic bag with seasoned flour and coated the meat well. Browned/cooked the meat until it was slightly crispy and the coating was nice and brown. I used fresh \"Royale\" mushrooms (wonderful!) not canned cut into small pieces and sauteed separately from the meat. Same with the chopped up onions. Did NOT add (a)the bacon (too salty) (b)corn starch (c)Worcestershire sauce or (d)any salt. I used (1)can of Campbell's mushroom soup with (2)cups of water instead of beef broth. After all was ready following the recipe I found here for times and such put it all together in a dutch oven and let it simmer. It was still very salty so I added white wine (Chardonnay) until taste evened out the saltiness. Stirred in the sour cream just before serving again to my own taste. First evening's dinner I used egg noodles and served to dinner guests. They went nuts! Loved it! Second night used the leftover stroganoff over white rice for myself. Both times it was EXCELLENT! I guarantee this recipe will delight you and your friends.",

The bacon is great - I have never had a stroganoff quite like this.  I'm not sure that sauteing the mushrooms separately did anything for the recipe - at least the way that I made it.  If using the stew meat, it probably would make a difference since you would be adding the mushrooms after a lot of simmering.",

My mom who doesn't eat large portions asked for a second helping and my grandfather who is a very picky eater cleaned his plate. I didn't use bacon but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. I agree with other reviewers that the sauce was a little runny so next time I will add more cornstarch. In addition I will use less salt as it was a little too salty for my liking. All in all it was easy to make and I will definitely be making it again. It would be a great recipe to make for company as you can start it well in advance.",

I don't use wine in my cooking and I was glad to find a good stroganoff recipe that didn't include wine. I like others used much less seasoned salt and fresh mushrooms. Very tasty the bacon gave it an unusual and nice added flavor. We will make it again!",
