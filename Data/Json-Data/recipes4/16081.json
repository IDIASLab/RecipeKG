So I made potstickers instead of wontons but with filling and more of it. The wrapper turn into one big noodle after they float to the top so you are basically eating a big bowl of noodles with a hint of shrimp flavor. I definitely recommend adding more to your dumpling suck as chopped veggies and more seasoning. I had a handful of frozen peas and carrots that I threw in just to give it some color but that didn't really help much for flavor. This recipe is okay but bland as written.",
