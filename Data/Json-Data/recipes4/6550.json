We liked all the veggies in there and cooking in milk was a great way to prepare this and get that strong fishy taste out of the fish. I was not able to find wheat germ in my local grocery store but I did find wheat bran. Other than that I did it just as explained. We both liked it but it was too \"runny\" I would not add all of the milk next time I would add some than mash it up and see if I needed more. Other that that this was great! I also tried a couple patties with Chipotle Panko crumbs on the outside and they were our favorites.  Thanks for sharing we will be trying this again with some modifications. Maybe some of that shredded zucchini that is in the freezer instead of white potatoes and crushed flax instead of wheat bran.",

I substituted the whet germ with flax seed meal and I substituted the bread crumbs with a mix of almond flour a little bit of coconut flour salt pepper and Italian seasoning. DEFINITELY add the milk slowly the recipe seems to call for too much which makes the mix too runny to form cakes. I had to add a lot more flax seed flour to thicken it up. I fried the cakes in grape seed oil instead of vegetable oil. I also created an aioli with aioli olive oil mayonnaise lemon juice fresh garlic salt and pepper to drizzle over the top! DELICIOUS!",
