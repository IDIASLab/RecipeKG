We just stick them in a cast iron pot (chopped up) and bury garlic cloves and onion pieces in them and sprinkle with salt. When they are done we drain them.  Also, in our house we separate the eggs first, beat the whites until they are fluffy, then fold them into the yolks and dried shrimp powder that has been mixed together already. Also, we use whole dried shrimp to make a shrimp broth instead of using bouillon or chicken broth. Your recipe is very good though, and very quick and simple to put together for times when you need something impressive fast:)",

Then add them to the blender using the water the chiles were in.  Also if you roast the chiles before doing anything to them it can add great flavor.  Enjoy!",

Most Hispanic stores carry these and some even have them peeled and chopped. All you do is boil them with a handful of cilantro, 2 garlic cloves, 1 whole onion and salt. Once these have boiled drain and rinse.  To give your tortas a lil more flavor add the whole dried shrimp. Just heat them a lil then grind them up in the food processor (me personally I use my blender...works the same). I also use chili guajillos and 2 chili arboles instead of the chili anchos. Your recipe is great but these simple additions will make a big difference.",

I heat them up then I blend them to powder form and combine this with the store bought shrimp powder. This gives the Tortas a richer shrimp flavor.  I don't use chili anchos I use chili Guajillos plus chili puya.  It doesn't have to be lent season in our house for this delectable dish. Thank you for adding ur recipe.",
