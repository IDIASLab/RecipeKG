I substituted the regular chicken broth for low soduim chick broth since the recipe calls for sesame oil and salt. I also used pork and veggie steamed dumplings instead of just veggie dumplings for a little variety. My boyfriend can be a picky eater and he absolutely loved this! Definately a keeper.",

While the broth of this soup is a little bland for my taste, I so much appreciate the quick idea and base for a fun and tasty soup. You can add anything you want to it, use up leftover veggies in the fridge. This soup is truly ready in 15 minutes max, even if you screw around with the flavoring for a bit. I added a splash of oyster sauce, crushed red pepper and green onion, and mushrooms, carrots, water chestnuts and pea pods in place of frozen vegetables. Great idea - thanks!",

Also I through the green onions in last so they'd retain their color. I served in deep bowls and doused with a little soy sauce for extra asian flare and it was fabulous!",
