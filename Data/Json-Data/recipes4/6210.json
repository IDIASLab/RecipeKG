I did have to add additional breadcrumbs to thicken up the mixture. Even with a half cup of additional breadcrumbs the meat loaf mixture was REALLY wet. The amount of liquids seemed to be quite excessive for meat loaf in my opinion. I had my doubts this would hold together at all but after almost two hours of cooking it did mostly hold together though it was very crumbly. The flavor was good but the texture was not something my family cared for. Slam me if you must for veering off from what the recipe called for meat wise but I think had I used the meat called for it still would have been too wet.",

I did make it a bit differently though only because my husband LOVES bacon! I took 8 slices of bacon and put them width-wise on a baking rack. Then I took 1/2 of the meat mixture shaped it into a loaf and put it on top of the bacon. Next I took 3/4 C shredded cheddar cheese sprinkled it over the meat and then took the remaining meat and put it over the top. Crimp the edges so the cheese stays in and then wrap the bacon over the top of the loaf. Set the rack in a shallow pan and WOW! It did take quite a bit longer than 75 minutes though almost 2 hours but it was well worth the wait:) Had a side of orzo pilaf and we were good to go. Thanks for a wonderful meatloaf recipe!",

Add more BBQ sauce and less ketchup for even more of a BBQ flavor. Depending on the fat content of your ground beef you may want to add more bread crumbs. I use ground sirloin hubby grinds so 1/2 cup is enough. Makes great leftovers too. Slice fry slightly until crispy brown and serve with more BBQ sauce. Or make cold ML and cole slaw Sammiches. This is a real favorite at our house!",
