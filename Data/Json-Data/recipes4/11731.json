I used 3 green bulb onions and sauteed them before adding to the lentils.  I also sauteed 3 thinly sliced carrots and added those to lentils early on.\r\nFor my sausage, I used Andouille sausage (it was all I had - I'd use Kielbassa next time for less spiciness).  I cooked it a bit before adding it to the lentils, as well.\r\nI added the cumin, salt & pepper as shown, plus some onion powder & 1/4 tsp of curry, although with the spicy sausage, it would've been fine with no curry.\r\nOverall, I'm quite pleased with the outcome!",
