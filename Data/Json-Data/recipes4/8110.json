This had a good flavor, but I think both cans of Ro-Tel should be drained, as I had some liquid in the bottom of the finished dish.",

Not lengthwise - you\u2019re cutting every strand in half so you don\u2019t get the nice long spaghetti-like strands. Width wise is easier than cutting it along the length. I\u2019ve seen so many recipes like this. Anyway, the sauce is great and would be delicious on regular pasta too.",
