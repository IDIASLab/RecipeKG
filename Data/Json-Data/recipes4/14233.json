Based on my own personal experience, I (i) halved the black bean sauce since Asian condiments can be very salty and ruin a dish (and my version of this recipe was still very salty - next time I would use only 1 tablespoon); (ii) presoaked the shitake mushrooms (3 hours in boiled water) because sometimes they take a long time to reconstitute; (iii) cooked the mushrooms first to make sure they were cooked and soft before adding the other ingredients (took about 1/2 hour for my mushrooms); (iv) pre-marinated the tofu in the mushroom oyster sauce; (v) added the tofu and green onions last to prevent mushiness and overcooking; (vi) added frozen spinach (what I had on hand); (vii) used different proportions (my packages from the store don\u2019t match the proportions specified in the recipe). I served mine mixed with chow mien noodles. Thank you CT Kelly for sharing your recipe.",
