The only change I made was two cans of black beans, just didn't have the red beans and an orange bell pepper or yellow can't remember, but these would not alter the taste. I've never added Worcestershire sauce or liquid smoke to my chili that I recall and it gave nice rustic flavor to the chili, the cocoa is my secret ingredient also ;-). Oh for the oregano I used my garden fresh instead of dry. Everybody loved this chili and sent the leftovers home with the kiddos for another meal. Only change that I'd make is to throw in a nice jalapeno pepper next time. Thanks ctooch99 for the recipe.",

Yup spicy & thick.\" We liked this chili but I just felt the ingredient list was unneccessarily long but to save on time I mixed all of the dry ingredients together in a small tupperware the night b4 (still not sure how a mere tsp of cocoa powder is the \"secret ingredient\" according to the recipe submitter but I included it too.) I prefer to have my chilis going in the crockpot all day so my family was surprised to come home to see chili in a large pot on the stovetop rather than chirping in the slow-cooker and as thick as it was I'm glad that it WAS in a pot so that I could keep my eye on it and stir it frequently. I won't lie - it was a delicious chili but not so earth-shattering that I'd follow the ingredient list to the letter next time I make it.",
