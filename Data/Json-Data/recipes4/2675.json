Didn't puree anything; the onions broke down on their own over time.  A couple hours before dinner I quickly sauteed some cubed potatoes for a few minutes and then added them and a can of garbanzo beans.  Let it simmer for a couple hours more and we had the perfect curry!  It was SO GOOD-smelled amazing in the house while cooking and the taste was perfect.  It was quite spicy but we like it that way.  Served with basmati rice and naan.  This will be a favorite and so easy and adaptable too!  Thanks for the great recipe!",

I would say to make sure your water JUST covers your onions or you will end up with a very thin sauce. Also I used 4T of hot curry paste and it was not very hot. May need more or it could be I used too much water with my onions? I cooked this in a slow cooker with skinless chicken thighs and legs. Very easy.",
