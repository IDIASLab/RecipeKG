I both added liquid AND decreased the rice to one cup. I still needed to add more water before serving as it was no longer really soup. I also added several beef boullion cubes for more depth of flavor. My stewed tomatoes were very large chunks so I chopped them into small pieces. I was fresh out of caribou so I used white-tailed deer venison (plentiful in my area). Thanks for a tasty recipe.",
