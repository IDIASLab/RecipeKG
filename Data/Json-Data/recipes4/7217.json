I like that it has sauce because whenever I eat traditional peppers and sausage I always want sauce on it. I browned my sausage (only used sweet sausage) before putting in the crock pot I used my homemade sauce and I cooked it on low for about 3 hours. The sausages were tender but didn't fall apart. I would definitely adjust the cooking time depending on how your crock pot cooks. Its great over noodles or in a hoagie roll",
