I used the dough hook to knead everything. I let the dough hook do the work for 10 minutes the dough will ride up on the hook so I had to stop the mixer and push it back down. I then wiped out the bowl and lightly greased it with olive oil and put the dough back in. In exactly one hour the dough had doubled in size. I then put it on a floured counter cut in half and put it on two prepared loaf pans I sprinkled the bottom of the pans with corn meal. I made two small changes as I only had 1/4 cup of ground flax seed. I added two Tbs of vital wheat gluten and oat bran to measure 1/2 cup. Yes the dough was very sticky but from past experience I know that this makes very moist bread. The cooking time was a bit off it was done in 40 minutes. I will be making this one again.

My visiting family members loved the taste; it has a sweetness from the molasses and a graininess from the variety of flours and the cereal that makes for a nice little taste. I made the dough in the bread machine finished off in the oven and did not have shredded wheat cereal so just used Grape Nuts. If I ever have Shredded Wheat I'll try that next time. Overall though this was a lovely bread. I made rolls and a free form loaf that turned out well. Thanks for the recipe.",
