I also omit the onions (picky kids) but add onion powder. As for the meat being tough, since I have cooked this many times, I have also ended up with tough meat. I found the answer. I saw on several cooking shows that if you cut against the grain of the meat (in the opposite direction)..it makes it almost fall apart. I let mine simmer for 30 mins.  This is one of our favorites and even my picky non vegetable eaters love this meal!!",

The changes I made were to put the round steak (whole, not sliced) into the slowcooker along with the cream of broccoli soup, water, and soy sauce.  Cooked it on low for 10hrs and when I got home from work, added the chopped broccoli florets into the pot... let those cook for about 45 minutes, and voila!  Dinner was served (and it was yummy too!).  I would have followed the recipe, but I was just too lazy and afraid that the steak would take too long to get tender (DH and I are starving by the time I get home from work and an hour to an hour and a half is an eternity on an empty stomach!).  But anyway, thanks Linda for the inspiration for a new meal in our rotation!",

Yes, I did modify just a touch, I added some minced garlic for kick, and only had 98% fat free cream of broccoli...also, I served it over brown rice, and it was really very good! I too sauted the onions w/garlic and added the beef and then other ingredients. It tasted even better the next day at lunch. A solid 5 star recipe I'm adding to my collection, thank you Linda!",

I had to make a lot of alterations to get it anywhere near good.  I added A LOT of red pepper flakes, garlic, chicken broth, much more soy sauce and a bunch of teriyaki sauce.  Before I made changes, it just tasted like broccoli soup.  :P  For the people whose broccoli melted in the sauce - in the last 5-10 minutes of cooking, reduce the heat and just set your broccoli on top of everything else in the pan. Put the lid on and it will steam your broccoli and it will be yummy and crunchy, not mushy!",
