I used selter instead of water - as the carbonated water helps to fluff up the matzo balls. I used only a tsp. of olive oil instead of the margarine and added some salt pepper and garlic powder to the mixture. I refrigerated the mixture for about 1/2 hour and rolled them into small balls with wet hands to help keep their shape. I let them boil in slated water with the pot cover on for about 25 minutes - no peaking - or the matzo balls will flip and fall to the bottom of the pot. I did not cook the matzo balls in the chicken soup - as I did not want the soup to become murky from the matzo balls as they cooked. I also froze them in a single layer on cookie sheet and then placed them in a zip lock bag - this way I can take out as many matzo balls as I wanted and they wouldn't be stuck together.",
