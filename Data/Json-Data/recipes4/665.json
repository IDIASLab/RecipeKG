Be careful of the order you mix things: the recipe says to mix, \"milk, white wine, etc\" but if you actually put milk and white wine in the pot one after another, the milk will curdle.  I simmered the white wine first, then mixed in the solid cheeses, then the cream cheese, and finally, once it was all melted together, the milk.  It seemed to work pretty well that way, of course, make sure you have all your ingredients ready because everything melts pretty quickly.  Also, even after adding the milk I thought it was pretty thick, so I used extra spinach for the liquid.  That was fine-- it tasted delicious.  My guests loved it and the spiciness was in no way overbearing.",

I had another cheese fondue also (the kind you buy already made in the gourmet cheese section of grocery), but this one was the hit!! I made a few changes though: I did not use any spinach or green onion. I did add some minced onion (about 1 tsp), and used Grey Poupon mustard in place of the dry mustard (about 1 tsp). I also added lemon juice (liberally) during the melting phase to help with the stringingness-totally helped! I also added my milk last which other reviewers had suggested-think this is key! My party LOVED this and couldn't get enough-I will be using this recipe instead of wasting my money on the already made stuff from now on! I also used a Sauvigon Blanc wine-think that helped with the flavor too. Just make sure when you are heating this on the stove to go slow and low. When we transferred it to the fondue pot, it stayed nice & creamy-although it was disappearing pretty fast! Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!",
