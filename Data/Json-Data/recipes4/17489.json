The directions leave out the heating step. I added cooked chicken while it heated on the stove. Mushrooms would be good to add and so would green peppers. The second time I made this with ground beef. I'm not sure what I did differently with the sauce but it was very strong tomato-tasting so I added a tablespoon or two of Italian seasoning.",
