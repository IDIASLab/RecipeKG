I did add some celery while cooking the sausage because I love the crunch celery gives stuffing/dressing. This turned out really good and I liked the flavor the sausage added. The only bad thing about the recipe is that it was too salty. Next time I will leave the salt out altogether and also use low sodium broth.",
