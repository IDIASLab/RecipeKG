The only thing I'll do differently next time is increasing the amounts on the spices and adding them to the meat while it's cooking with the onion instead of with the other ingredients. I used two lbs of beef and a little extra on the other ingredients as well (12oz salsa, a bag of frozen corn) and it made an enormous casserole - I used a 4.8 quart dish and it was probably enough for 6-8 people.",
