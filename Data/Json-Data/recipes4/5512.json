The trick for this salsa is marinating the onions and jalapenos in lime juice for about 5 minutes before adding the tomatoes and cilantro. There are two tricks to this recipe: 1. Hand-chop everything. It takes a while, but it is worth it.  2. The marinating is what makes this salsa special. Hope you enjoy.",

I made it exactly as the recipe stated, using a red jalapeno (which I prefer) and kosher salt.  The measurements are right on the money.  This is great by the spoonful or as an accompaniment to something else.  For those who aren't used to using jalapenos, be sure to read how to handle them, and know that each jalapeno has its own level of heat even by the kind of variety.  So you may want to tread carefully.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I also added a couple cloves fresh garlic. I wanted a variety of textures in this salsa--I threw half of the onion, all the jalapeno, the lime juice, half of the tomatoes, the cilantro and salt in the blender and used the \"ice crushing\" feature to chop them into a finer consistancy. I then folded the pureed ingredients into the remaining onion and tomatoes. This was very good--the longer it sits, the better it tastes. We ate every single bit of it with our Black Bean Taco Salads.",

Your amounts were right on. I need the recipe because I have had people ask me for mine and couldn't give them anything more than the ingredients and tell them to figure it out. Now I have it thanks. I use sweet onion in mine. I also crush the cilantro and roll it in my palms then dice it fine before adding it. It helps distribute the flavor and make it less intense in a single bite. I also use about three medium sized green jalapenos mainly for aesthetics as the green is pleasing to the eye with the red of the tomato. I like the flavor of key lime when I can find good fresh ones though that often doesn't happen in Oregon. I use four to five. I don't marinate but am probably going to try that if I make it the same day as I will use it usually try to make the salsa a day before for the best flavor distribution though sometimes decided on the dinner plan the day of. Also have my special ingredient that I add last after checking the spiciness. Tiger Sauce! My all time favorite hot sauce. It just add a very special flavor. I am careful about how much I add depending on who is going to eat it. Kids and some adults prefer it on a milder side so I often split mine and then spice only part of it up for the more daring side of the crowd. I also do like to add some crushed garlic about a half teaspoon.",

I have just spent the last 3 hours trying to fix it and ended up turning it into an actual salsa with canned tomatoes and sugar and cumin to try and tame the sourness. It is still uber sour, and I am really upset about it. I'm trying to understand if all the amazing reviewers love the sourness of that much lime juice? I don't get it. And the amount of red onion is crazy! 1/2 a cup would have been plenty and I will forever use a sweet yellow onion from now on, the red onion is way too overpowering. \nIf I am missing something from this recipe and I made a mistake, then please let me know, otherwise, this recipe is terrible in my opinion.",
