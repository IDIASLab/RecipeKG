In fact my family enjoyed these potatoes so much; I will freeze diced fresh jalape\u00f1os to make this in the winter months. I admit to using fresh jalape\u00f1os rather than canned. I also used white sharp cheddar because that is what I had on hand. Rather than layering all the potatoes then adding the sauce I put a layer of potatoes in the dish added cheese sauce potatoes cheese sauce etc. I had 4 layers of potatoes and poured the remaining cheese sauce over the top. The potatoes were served with Pittsburgh Ham Barbecues another AR recipe. My dad came to dinner tonight and he thought the meal was delicious. Potatoes will be a repeat in our house.
