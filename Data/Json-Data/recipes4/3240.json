I have also had to share the recipe with my neighbor after he smelled it while it was cooking! I will add that you should soak the mussels before you cook them in order to get the sand out of them: Place the mussels in a large pot (8qt or so) and for every 24 mussels add 4 cups of cold water and 1/3 cup salt. Stir well once to mix the salt mussels and water. After soaking for about 15 or 20 minutes dump the water rinse the mussels and repeat. Complete the process a total of 3 times. We just made this again tonight (the windchill here in MN was -14 but we really wanted to grill.) We added a bag of bay scallops on top of the mussels and then topped off each individual bowl (when it was finished) with a squeeze of lime and a sprinkle of garlic salt and curry powder -- WOW! This was amazing! We served it with a baked potato & a salad. Thank you so much for this recipe!",

As a complimentary side definitely add a very crusty bread as the sauce is perfect in combination with an italian or sourdough loaf.",

I wanted to review for one reason: I am a stove-top mussel cooker and every recipe I see I make on the stove. If you also would rather make this on the stove top do NOT add the lime slices. Instead squeeze some lime juice on right before serving. The boiled lime actually REALLY overpowered everything and gave a bitter aftertaste...I found out the hard way haha!",
