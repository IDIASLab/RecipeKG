After letting it cook for about 3 hours I almost threw it out because the smell was too much. I decided to put the crockpot in the garage instead so I didn't have to smell it anymore. I expected it to taste awful and was a little nervous when my husband brought it in from the garage and started to slice it. I had a frozen pizza ready to go just in case. Much to my surprise it was very very good. The only changes I would make is definitely cooking it in the garage unless the smell of slow cooking venison is something you actually like. The other is that I would season the meat. The recipe didn't call for seasonings so I didn't but it could have used something. It was a little bland. It was very tender though. I served it on buns. I'll be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!",

I used only 1 can of beer and a can of beef broth, a 12oz jar of pepperoncini (w/ juices), a good spoonful of minced garlic, added a good shake of dry onion flakes, and a pinch of dried rosemary. The men (who already love venison) loved this - these made great sandwiches! The smell wasn't strong to us but then again - I did make some modifications. Thanks Ellie for the great & simple recipe!",
