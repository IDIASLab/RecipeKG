Apparently it was over shadowed by the jalapenos. I don't like trout but my man really does and next time I will be tweaking the recipe a bit. I am going to double up on the garlic. Half the garlic will be sauteed with the jalapenos and onions along with some parmesan cheese and a tbsp of butter. When I place the trout in the foil I will place the sauteed mixture on top and allow to dribble off the fish. Then I will place the required butter and the other half of the garlic which I will have crushed on top of the trout and then I'll wrap it all up neat and tidy in the foil packet and bake for the 25 minutes that you suggested. Hopefully that will make him happier...and thank you so much for this recipe...it has great potential to build off of!",
