I very lightly sprayed an old cookie sheet and as long as I only let the cookies set for a minute or two after coming out of the oven they stayed together fine.

Not too sweet either although I used lightly salted nuts so that might have offset the sweetness. This recipe filled 3 industrial-size baking sheets with about 30-50 cookies per sheet. They did crack while baking so I'm wondering if there is a way to prevent that... The best part about these is that you can eat several of them without too much guilt:)",
