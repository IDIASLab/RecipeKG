This was something different fairly simple and really yummy. I definitely recommend adding the beans it seems odd but they do work really well in this. Give this recipe a shot it's SO good!",

I substituted fresh mushrooms for the black beans and grilled them with the chicken onion and spices as the recipe suggested and placed the meat mixture on the bottom of the pie pan. I also made my own spicy marinara sauce and then poured it on top of the chicken. I layered the mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce and chicken and topped it off with the batter and cooked as directed. Thanks for the recipe Acahewowow. It's a keeper.",

I changed it up just a tad and only because I didn't have all the required ingredients. Instead of using the canned tomatoes the tomato paste onions basil garlic onions and oregano.... I just used used a jar or Spaghetti sauce (Ragu Sauteed Onion and Garlic). I also used milk instead of almond milk. And I took the advice of another reviewer and i layered the fresh mozzarella on top of the chicken mixture. I served with a side of linguine and peas. This will become my new way of making chicken Parmesan!",
