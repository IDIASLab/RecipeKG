Once tender, I added flour to make a roux, then added milk to make a thick white (bechamel) sauce.  I added salk and pepper to taste.  I sliced my potatoes, put one layer in a 13x9\" pan, topped with a little salt and pepper, then half the sauce.  I topped this with a couple ounces of gouda chopped into cubes.  Then I repeated the process: potatoes, s+p, rest of the sauce, and another couple ounces of gouda, then baked for about an hour.  I usually make this exactly the same way but without the gouda.  Never again will I do this without gouda - it was PERFECT!  SO flavorful and a great consistency (I don't like them runny).  I forgot about garlic but I don't think it was missed.  SO easy and SO yummy!",

Very similar recipes, with very similar results, yet somehow this one really left me with a remarkable impression.  First, it requires no pre-cooking of the potatoes, which actually made them turn out far superior to those in the last recipe that required the precooking.  Second, the recipe calls for Gouda, and since I used the smoked variety, we were rewarded with a lot of extra flavor. In addition, the cooking time was low and slow, not only giving me ample \u201chands free\u201d time to prepare the rest of our dinner, but it almost guaranteed the potatoes would be cooked through with deliciously melded flavors.  This was truly memorable.",
