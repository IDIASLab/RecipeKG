I've cooked for almost 30 years, 10+ as a professional chef.  In all this time I've never thought to add hamburger to baked beans.  Simple idea that works well.\n\n  But I find it odd that so many people, (Including the author) refer to this as, \"Chili\".  It's not chili.  There are countless variations on chili, from  \"Texas style\", to, \"Cincinnati style\" and everything in between.  But one thing they all have in common is that they contain some sort of chile pepper, be it fresh, dried, paste, liquid, or whatever.  A green bell pepper doesn't really count for this one. There's a reason chili is called, \"Chili\"...It has to contain CHILE.\n\n It's funny how many people have either said that this is their favorite chili recipe or that it wasn't very good chili.  It's NOT chili and it's NOT supposed to be!  I recently tried a new chocolate cake recipe...It wasn't very good chili either...But my family thought it was the best chili they ever tasted! ;~}  I did really like the, \"Slow Cooker Bean Casserole though.\n",
