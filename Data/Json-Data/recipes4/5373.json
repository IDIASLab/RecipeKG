                "reviewBody": "Excellent soup after my alterations! Everyone loved it! My initial reading of this recipe alerted me that it would be a very bland tasting soup. My only alterations were that I used 2 pounds of Yukon Gold potatoes, added 1 sliced celery stalk and added a large bay leaf. I also substituted the garlic powder with 4 garlic cloves that I minced and saut\u00e9ed with the leeks and onions. I used 6 ounces of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and omitted the parsley. I offered crumbled cooked bacon, fresh snipped chives and prepared garlic-Parmesan croutons as options for diners to top their soup serving with. Next time, I will use individual sized shepherd loaves as serving bowls and make homemade garlic-Parmesan croutons out of the scooped bread from the shepherd loaves.\n\nTips:\nYukon Gold potatoes won't get mushy like russet potatoes will when boiling them. Use russet potatoes if you want a thick soup and mash them when they are tender.\n\nRinse the leeks in a bowl of cold water so to remove any sand, remove the leeks and wring dry in towels.\n\nKeep the cubed potatoes in a bowl of cold water till needed.\n\nAlways turn off the heat before stirring in the cheese so that the cheese won't separate.",

Leeks, potatoes, chicken broth and a little milk or cream is really all you need and that\u2019s what you get here.  Still, I wanted a more pronounced leek flavor so I doubled up on that.  While the potatoes were cooking I threw in a bay leaf and a good pinch of fresh thyme just to brighten the flavor.  I used fresh minced garlic rather than garlic powder and skipped the parsley and cheddar cheese.  When the soup was done I pureed it in a flash with my immersion blender. A drizzle of good white truffle oil took this soup from excellent to sublime.",

I doctored it up some added thyme some seasoned salt more black pepper additional chicken soup base and a light sprinkling of cayenne (not enough to make it spicy). I liked it better then but ugh the soup broke. Obviously my fault not the recipes I must have let it simmer too hard after adding the half-and-half. Using heavy cream makes that less likely to happen but I should have been more watchful. I'll revisit this recipe with the added herbs and real garlic perhaps celery.",
