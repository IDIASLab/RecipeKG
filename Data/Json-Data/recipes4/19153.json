After I took the picture, I doubled both milks, and it was still dry. I put it back on the stove, added more milk, big handful of dried cranberries, more cinnamon and 2 tbsp. of coconut sugar. I also added a heaping tablespoon of chia seed, because only 1 teaspoon was not going to add much nutritionally. I enjoyed it much more this way.",
