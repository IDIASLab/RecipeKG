It was a little too watery for us so I made some herb flavored dumplings and turned it into a squirrel pot pie. All in all it wasn't bad and with the changes it is a 5 star make again recipe.",

Many people who have eaten squirrel all of their lives said that they had never had squirrel so tender before. I may never fry another squirrel from now on and I love fried squirrel. I have made this meal again since the church supper and this time I made it for a book club meeting where I am the only male member. Many of the ladies said \"Ewwww squirrel \" but after giving it a taste they ate it up. This time I used 4 squirrels instead of 3 and added a pack of beef stew mix that was made for use in slow cookers. I liked it better this way.",
