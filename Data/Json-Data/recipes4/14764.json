        "description": "I wanted to make a Mardi Gras King Cake for my friends because we are expatriates in Malaysia with no bakeries that can make them, and some people we know have never even tried one!  However, I wanted to make it lighter too, so I made some substitutions and created my own cake that appears and tastes decadent, but is actually quite light. Bakeries in Louisiana do standard cinnamon-sugar fillings, but they do all kinds of other fruit/pudding fillings, too, so I decided to go fruity.  Laissez les bon temps rouler! Add some edible beads for further decoration if you can find them!",
