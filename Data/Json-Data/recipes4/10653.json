I put everything together and popped it in the crockpot for 8 hours, and the meat was falling apart.  Also I cooked the noodles aldente and then threw them in the crockpot for the last 10 or so minutes.  The noodles soaked up the sauce and it was wonderful!  Loved this recipe!!!!",

I use stew beef and season it with onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper. I brown it in olive oil before it goes in the oven. For the sauce, I use a can of cream of mushroom mixed with an equal amount of milk, an envelope of beefy onion, and a package of brown gravy mix. The milk gives me twice as much sauce, and the gravy mix thickens it up. It also seems to dilute the salt, because I haven't had any issues with it being too salty.",

I love garlic and onions, so I added one tablespoon diced garlic and a small onion, chopped. I make the cream of mushroom soup using 1/2 can of milk, then add the onion soup mix and a little more water than called for. I also add about a tablespoon of concentrated beef broth. I added the onions, garlic, and mushrooms to the mixture and than poured over the meat.\r\n\r\nI have plenty of sauce to mix in with the noodles this way. Just a suggestion for those of you who said you didn't have enough gravy at the end.\r\n\r\n",

Better when cooked at a lower temp for a long period of time (preheat oven to 375 and then turn down to 250 and cook for several hours).  Perfect slow cooker recipe - can be left on low all day long!  Try serving over rice, rather than the noodles.",

I added extra cream of mushroom soup (2 cans) because the last time I made it I ended up covering it half way through cooking. Also it made more to go with the 16oz bag of noodles I cooked. I used a can of milk instead of water and added sliced fresh mushrooms rather then canned. Served it with biscuits. My husband Loved it. YUMMY !!! Next time I make it it will be half the onion soup mix (Onion soup mix is very salty)\nThank you for sharing .",

I browned the beef tips with a little butter and the soup mix in my pressure cooker, then added the remaining ingredients, put the lid on and cooked for 30 min.  The beef couldn't have been more tender, and my husband loved it.  I'd rather not heat the house with the oven...if ya know what I mean, plus this was quicker, and probably more tender.

So even though this recipe was a starting point for me, it deserves credit.  I took lots of suggestions from others too.  Browned stew meat (bite-size pieces), seasoned with pepper, onion and garlic powder.  I doubled the recipe, so used 1 can of cr of mush and 1 can of golden mush.  2 cups of beef stock for the water, 1/2 packet of the soup mix plus some real onion (to avoid being too salty).  Added maybe a tsp of Kitchen Bouquet, couple splashes of Worsey, 1/4 tsp dried mustard.  Deglazed skillet with beef stock.  All into crock pot for 4 hours.  In the last hour, added the mushrooms and 2-3 pinches of basil (remember to crush between fingers while adding).  At the end, 2T cornstarch in a bit of cold beef stock to thicken gravy (leave lid off, 30 mins).  Total cook time in crock on High, 4.5 hours.  Made 3/4 bag (about 12 oz) of egg noodles and ran a little short, so use a whole 16oz bag for a double batch.  Overall, it was perfect!  My guys ate this stuff up!  Thanks for the recipe and to everyone for all of the added tips.",
