Chopped the cashews finely in the food processor, so they were fine enough to stick to the chicken.  Pounded the chicken breasts to a little less than a half inch, so it was more tender.  Then I cooked the chicken on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet lined with aluminum; this kept the bottom of the chicken from getting soggy.",

I found that you have to pour the extra sauce over the chicken before serving, and that adds the taste you need.  Also, I omitted the curry and used garlic powder and a dash of teriyaki sauce instead, and substituted well crushed peanuts for the cashews.  The sauce came out like a nice tangy duck sauce.  Orange marmalade would work well in this recipe.  Next time I will try jellied cranberry sauce, port wine, and cinnamon or allspice for the sauce, with minced walnuts as the crust.  Thanks Brennan for a great recipe!",

I highly recommend trying them if you like nuts!  They'll leave your tastebuds tingling!  This is coming from people who prefer and love cashews the most!!  So, we won't be putting this on our regular cycle of dishes for our weekly get-togethers.  Didn't pass the taste test in our cooking club that meets monthly either.  I tried several times to give this a chance.  It's just okay at best.  Sorry!",
