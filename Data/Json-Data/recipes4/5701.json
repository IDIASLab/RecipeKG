I tasted the cheese mixture and was concerned it was going to be too hot but after baking it was just right. I had never steamed the jalapenos before baking and almost skipped this step but I'm glad I steamed them. Since I had already bought bacon to wrap them in like I normally do I went ahead and used it. My family would have been disappointed if I hadn't used the bacon. I made mine with Morning Star Farms veggie bacon and real bacon for theirs. One son did ask that I make a few with plain cream cheese next time. I used about 14 peppers and had some cheese mixture left over. Guess I'll have to get more peppers and I'll probably eat them all. They are addictive! Thanks for this great recipe!",
