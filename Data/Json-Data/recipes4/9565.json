Although it's not bad it's not particularly good. It's a good recipe to keep on hand since it requires so few ingredients and I usually have them on hand but it won't be in my regular rotation. I found the tomato soup too sweet and the cheese overpowering. Maybe next time I'll use more tomato sauce and eliminate the soup and use cheddar instead of American cheese.",
