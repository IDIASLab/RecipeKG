I was not on board.\" After just 2 hrs. on high this chili was scorching around the edges b/c there really weren't any liquid-ey ingredients. I cut it back to low trying to stay faithful to the directions but a couple hrs. later had to add some chicken broth to prevent it from turning into a clumpy burnt mess. Maybe the \"burnt\" gave it some unusual flavor that my family loved but I just didn't enjoy very much. Not thrilled w/ the onion and bell peppers going in raw rather than them being browned w/ the ground beef but that did ultimately make this a very easy chili to prepare. Oh and lastly the only thing that I did differently was use black beans instead of kidney and a small can of chile peppers instead of jalapenos.",

I looked at the ingredient list and modified a few things for example I don't like chunky tomatoes so I used plain tomato sauce instead. Also I did not have dried oregano so I substituted with Adobo seasoning. I also did not have cayenne pepper so I left it out. I figured the jalape\u00f1os were enough heat for the recipe. I left most of the seeds in the jalape\u00f1os as I chopped them. I also did not fry the ground beef and drain the fat from it before putting in the slow cooker I put everything into the slow cooker at once. IMO it's pointless to cook ingredients before putting them in the slow cooker. The whole point of the slow cooker is to not have to do that and also the fat from the meat made the recipe much more moist. Very tasty and moist!",
