Instead of water I poured some pinot grigio in the caserole dish before cooking. The sour cream needs to be heated before putting on maybe cooked on the defrost setting in the microwave because it made the quail cold. But otherwise the sour cream is the perfect compliment to the flavor of the quail meat!",
