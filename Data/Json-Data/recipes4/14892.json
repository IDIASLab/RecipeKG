Cooked 45 minutes on high, released pressure, added potatoes (quartered), 1/2 onion sliced & quartered and 6 carrots (peeled and sliced in 2\" logs); also added 1/2 can of chicken broth I had left over from lunch. Cooked on high for an additional 10 minutes. Great! Could have done 9 minutes on the vegetables in my Cuisinart PC; they were soft - but not mushy. Will make again and might try a variation of this recipe adding a can of cream soup.\nNote: My husband said I should have cooked the roast a little longer in my Cuisinart PC so I will add about 10 more mintues next time before adding the vegetables. It could have been a little more tender.",

I browned and pressure cooked it, but only for 30 minutes since it's a smaller cut of meat.  It turned out incredible.  I made mashed potatoes instead of roasted, but next time I will put the potatoes in with the turkey.  Thank you for the inspiration to try the pressure cooker with turkey - delicious!",

I used one package of Lipton Onion soup and about 1/3 packet of Lipton Beefy Onion soup.  I cooked it in the Instant Pot on meat setting (high pressure) for 45 minutes and then let pressure come down naturally before putting in baby carrots, half a large onion, and large chunks of potatoes (3 large ones), and a sprinkle of celery seed and celery salt.  I added some beef broth  lifted the meat over the vegetables  to make sure the vegetables were immersed.   Then it was manual low pressure for 9 minutes and natural pressure release for 15 minutes and then I released the rest of the pressure and placed the meat and vegetables in a platter and made the gravy as instructed.  It was tender, juicy and so delicious!  My son and I ate more than we should - so  yummy!",
