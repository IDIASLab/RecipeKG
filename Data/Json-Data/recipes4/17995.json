I was looking for a recipe which included broccoli rabe I have to admit I was hesitant to make a recipe with out any reviews but I am SO glad I did!! I did not have cavatelli on hand so I substituted cavatappi. Being pregnant I substituted pasta water for the half of cup of wine and honestly the flavors were still amazing even without the wine. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written using sweet sausage. I did add 1 tablespoon of sugar to the boiling water of the broccoli rabe a trick my grandmother always did saying it cut some of the bitter taste. Kale could be used instead of broccoli rabe too. This recipe will be getting added to our menu rotation. Husband and kids (5 & 3) all gave this recipe 5 stars. Thank you for such a great recipe!",

I've only ever made it sauteed with garlic olive oil and a squeeze of fresh lemon over it - so I was happy to find this main dish meal recipe using it. I made as directed except used rigatoni in place of the cavetelli (hubs request). We both enjoyed this! Thanks Jan for sharing your recipe!",
