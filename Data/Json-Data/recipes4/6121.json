                "reviewBody": "I was looking for a way to do a roast that wasn't the standard 'onion soup and mushroom' treatment.  I followed the ingredient list to the letter.  I followed the cooking method up to the braising time and temperature.  I started out at 350F and after 1 hour turned the temp down to 300F.  The roast was in the oven for a total of 5 hours.  This was fall apart tender and also  moist.  The smell was great, the flavor was good and I still wanted more intensity in flavor with the end product.  After taking the meat out and tenting with foil to let it rest, I took 1 1/2 cups of the juice from the pan, added 1 cup of a nice merlot, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 2 T honey, 2 T balsamic vinegar, 1/2 tsp beef boullion, 1 T of Worcestershire and a few good shakes of Frank's Hot sauce.   I reduced that on the stove top and thickened it just a tad with a little bit of a roux until I had a syrup like consistency.  Pouring a bit of that over the meat after it was plated gave it just the distinct flavor that I had hoped for from the recipe itself.  You could certainly serve this with the traditional potatoes and carrots if you wanted to, but I think it lends itself better to the treatment I gave it, allowing a lesser cut of meat to really shine.",

I browned the meat in a skillet and put it in the crockpot with about 1c of beef broth. I added a couple tablespoons balsamic and red wine vinegar. About 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce and some Cholula hot sauce. Then I sauteed the onions in the meat drippings left in the skillet once golden I added 1 can of diced tomatoes and some balsamic vinegar and cooked until the liquid reduced some. I added it to the crockpot over and around the meat. Cooked on High for 2 hours then low for 3 hours. I removed the meat from the crockpot then cooked some fingerling potatoes and carrots adding some beef broth to the remaining liquid. I also used some of the liquid to prepare quinoa in my rice cooker. This is a winner if you're looking for a change from the 'mushroom/onion soup' style roast. The only thing i will do different next time is add Marsala wine to the mix.",

My boyfriend said this blew his moms pot roast outta the park (and shes a really good experienced cook). Great job SO moist a lot of flavor it was perfect! I approximated the measurements and only used 14 oz. of diced tomatoes and some extra balsamic vinegar. Tomatoes were especially good! I covered a pan with foil and stuck it in the oven after I browned it. And I used a 2.5 lb pot roast so I only cooked it for 3 hrs. Kudos on the recipe you did a great job!",
