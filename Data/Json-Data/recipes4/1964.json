I rubbed in the spices and let the roast sit in the frig for 2 days.  I increased the bacon slices and green onions to 12 each.  I laid 6 slices of bacon out, put 6 green onions perpendicular to the bacon slices, laid the pork roast on top of the onions, put 6 more green onions on the roast going the same direction as the bottom ones, covered it with 6 bacon slices, and tied it up.  I cooked it in a covered pan on the grill and uncovered it the last 15 minutes to brown the roast and bacon.  It is a beautiful presentation and the taste is superb.  Great recipe.",
