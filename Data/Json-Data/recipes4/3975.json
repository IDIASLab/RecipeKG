I used the same amount of mayo 1 tsp of dill 1/2 tsp lemon pepper tad bit more cracked black pepper salt and it was PERFECT!!!!! I think the lemon pepper was key. Just a few shakes goes a long way. Turkey bacon for a little healther fat and whole wheat buns added sauce to fish and to buns.... THANK YOU!! =)",
