I was happy to find the nutritional yeast in the bulk section of Whole Foods and bought only a little bit as it's not something that I've used before and wasn't sure if I'd like it! I scaled this to 3 servings. I also pre-cooked my rice noodles for a bit as the type I was using said to boil for 6 minutes so I wanted to be sure they were cooked. I added the dashi broth powder to the boiling water while still on the stove and whisked in the eggs while it was still boiling then poured the broth over the noodles and veggies in the bowls. My husband and I both loved this! I was in such a hurry to take a picture before it got cold that I ALMOST forgot to add the soy sauce/miso paste/sesame oil mixture on top! Will be making this one again! Thanks Buckwheat Queen!",
