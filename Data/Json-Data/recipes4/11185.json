I was worried about it but surprised and happy to find the end result SO good! It has a different taste and texture..so keep that in mind. I did use spices while cooking my rice and added more when mixing the egg and cheese in. I baked it for a few mins. before filling with veggie mixture and adding a \"top\" crust...and sprinkled cheese on top of that when it had 4 min. left to bake. A trick I learned...to get the crust to form for this I had a bowl of clean water and dipped my hands in and dried them off before forming (otherwise it would stick and not mold for a pot pie crust). That really worked and helped me out so much! Have fun..this is great and my children and I hope to make the pizza next!:)",
