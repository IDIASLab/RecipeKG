I followed your recipe to the letter took some to work and realized how much it was missing. I scaled this to 12 servings. When I got home I added one can of diced tomatoes one large can of tomato sauce 1 small can of tomato paste 3/4 cup of light sour cream (remember 12 servings) a half cup of red wine one teaspoon of chicken broth granules for every two cups of water basil salt and pepper. Now it's got body taste and still not a lot of fat. If this sounds too much like work read the other recipes that use heavy cream cheddar and a lot of butter. After my additions it wins the 5 stars. Thanks for the good working base recipe.",

I was in a bit of a time crunch so instead of using fresh tomatos and potatos I used about 7-8 canned whole tomatos and 3/4 of a can of sliced potatos. I also used the liquid from the tomatos in place of some of the water. Using canned veggies cut the first cooking time down quite a bit since the veggies didn't have to soften. I also added about a tablespoon of beef boullion granuals toward the end for a little more flavor. I'll make this again.",
