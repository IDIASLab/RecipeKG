I peel, slice lengthwise and place yolk side down on my most elegant glass platter.  The appearance is of delicate marble eggs.  Even kids love the taste.  I call them 1000 year old eggs after the traditional Chinese dish...not the same at all, but they look antique!",

What I usually do is that I just throw the eggs in with the sauce in the initial boil and simmer for a few hours and just let it marinate in the fridge in a container until I want to eat one. I also save the marinade for the next batch of tea eggs I want to make. I also found that adding a small amount of sugar makes it taste better. And in general to prevent the egg from cracking in the beginning it is best to let the eggs come to room temperature.",
