It came out with a FANTASTIC crunchy/chewy crust like you usually only find in artisan bread or with a steam machine. I used shredded cheddar jack cheese instead of processed cheese and just kneaded it in. Make sure to let the dough rest after adding the whole wheat flour. (Whole wheat flour absorbs more water more slowly so if you don't let it rest you knead too much white flour in and it turns out dry.) I also added two teaspoons of minced garlic into the cornmeal mix. Fantastic.",
