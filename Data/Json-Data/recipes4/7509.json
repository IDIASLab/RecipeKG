As I always do, I cooked the egg separately like a crepe,  then rolled it up like a cigar and sliced it into ribbons, chiffonade style.  I cooked  the rice and  carrots ahead of  time as well, the carrots nuked in a bit of water.  After cooking the rice I spread  it out on a cookie sheet and refrigerated it until it was good and cold (the best way of doing fried rice).  Once I was ready to put this together for supper, it was an absolute snap.  For really authentic and delicious flavor, I added a wee drizzle of toasted sesame oil.  Topped with saut\u00e9ed shrimp and scallops, with some steamed asparagus on the side, this was a dinner I'll probably dream about  - or at least think about the next time I get hungry!",

Start with cold rice (make sure it's broken apart -- don't throw any stuck-together hunks into the pan).   I increased the soy sauce to 1 tablespoon, used peanut oil instead of canola oil (personal preference when cooking Chinese dishes), added a little fresh grated ginger with the garlic, and added a tablespoon of toasted sesame seeds at the end before serving.  I omitted the frozen peas (don't really like them) and used shelled edamame instead.  Yummy dish that can easily be adapted to use what you have on hand.  I will be making again and again and will add meat and seafood to make it a quick and easy main dish.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a good recipe with the right proportions but I think the instruction to scramble the eggs first is unnecessary. I made a well in the rice added a small squirt of oil poured the beaten egg into the well and scrambled it with my hoak. Then I added the soy sauce salt & pepper and tossed it all together. I only used 1 egg but it was a Large one. 2 Medium eggs would be about right for 4 cups of rice. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could but as written it loses a star for the extra unneeded step of scrambling the egg and removing it from the pan. I think scrambling it last keeps it tender where letting it rest for 5 minutes may make it a little chewy. Otherwise excellent recipe for straight up fried rice.",
