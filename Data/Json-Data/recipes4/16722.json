Usually Gruyere cheese is used but I had some very sharp farmhouse Cheddar cheese in the fridge, so I decided to use that. As long as you are using a very sharp, full-flavored cheese I don't think you can go wrong. I love gougeres with Gruyere, but I think the extra-sharp Cheddar was just as good.",

Some people will say I shouldn't be rating this because I change the ingredients. I used chives (my plant was going crazy)and Gruyere(what I had on hand) but I think the point is the technique not necessarily the type of cheese or herbs. The instructions are perfect just make sure to make a double batch because they disappear fast.",

To all the folk who say they are not cheesy or have no flavor, they need to try different cheeses - a cheese they like since everyone has different tastebuds.   The better the cheese, the better the gougeres.   And if they deflate, it means they were taken out of the oven a little too soon; try turning the oven off, turn them over and leave for 5 minutes.    \nChef John,  I choose your recipes first - they are always a winner!

For a family meal they were great but I would have been disappointed to serve them to guests. The second time I beat the dough for much longer and more vigorously than my first batch. Much better! They still deflated somewhat but they were still pretty and tasty. I used a plastic storage bag with an end snipped away to \"pipe\" the dough onto parchment paper and all that worked well both times. I'll probably make these again.",

But I didn't have any sharp cheddar so I used mexican style blend cheese, which is what I had, it still worked out. Though it's not as fluffy as I thought it would be either, its a bit dense. I might have to tone the thyme down though, cause it's really strong in my opinion. But it smelled soooo good when it was in the oven ??
