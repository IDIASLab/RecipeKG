I made some alterations:  we marinated the chicken in soy sauce/garlic/ginger/splenda, I also made extra sauce, adding a bit more hoisin sauce and added some splenda to the recipe to make it a bit more sweet to ward of some of the heat from the spices.  I skipped out on the salt in the recipe...  I found that this recipe was already on the salty side, so I also used low-sodium chicken broth.  This is now a family favorite!  It's also great with sticky rice.",

I could still taste some 'heat' which was just perfect for my family. Didn't have any hoisin sauce so I added 1 tbl brown sugar as others mentioned. It wasn't sweet tasting at all but was delicious.  I think there was a misprint in the recipe on the garlic so I only used 4 cloves. I also added celery, green bell peppers, mushrooms, and slightly steamed carrots.  I also added 8 oz of al dente spaghetti so I increased the chicken stock to 2/3 cup and mixed in 1 tbl of cornstarch to it to thicken the sauce a bit before adding the cooked spaghetti. Just what I was looking for. Loved the ginger in it.",

I tripled the sauce but only added 2 t. of garlic chile paste which was plenty hot for us and we like spicy.

Instead of putting the broccoli in a steamer I used the steam tray of my rice cooker (because who isn't going to eat this without rice?) and cooked those two at the same time while the chicken was cooking in a separate pot. Instead of green onions I used a red onion just because that's what I had. I also added a coarsely chopped red pepper for some extra flavor and texture. As per another review I also doubled the sauce. It cooked up fairly quickly and was a tasty meal. I plan on making it again. Thanks!",
