I figured I could always stir in some lemon juice after if I changed my mind. But I love the flavor of the dandelion alone. Tip for the person who complained their syrup was too runny because the recipe doesn't specify water amount - the point of boiling a syrup down is actually to cook off the water, so if the syrup is too watery, that just means you need to cook it longer. Next time try dipping in a cold spoon; if it coats the spoon, it's about ready. However, thinner syrup is perfect for cocktails!",
