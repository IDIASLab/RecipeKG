I don't have a bread maker so I did it this way for 2 loaves.  2 cups of warm water with 6 tbsp of honey dissolved in it.  then sprinkle 2 1/4 tsp of yeast and let proof for 10 minutes.  Then add 1/4 cup of oil and 1 1/2 tsp salt.  Then all your flour (I used about 5 cups, half whole wheat and half white) and seeds.  I also added hemp hearts which are high in omega 6 and omega 3 fats.  Then I let rise in a oiled bowl for 1 hour, punch down and divide into 2 loaves then let rise again for 45 min.  Bake at 375 for 30 minutes.  SOOO GOOD!!!",

Combined and then kneaded the bread for 10 minutes or until the dough was smooth and my arms were about to fall off.\n\nSet to rise in greased bowl for 1.5 hours or until doubled in size.\n\nPunched it.\n\nTransferred dough to a greased bread pan, covered and let rise again for 20 minutes.\n\nBaked in a 350 oven for about 30 minutes. Removed from pan and if the bottom wasn't golden I flipped the bread and put it back in the oven until golden.\n\nRemoved, let cool on wire rack and now I'm enjoying it as we speak. So far best whole wheat bread ever!",

In previous reviews, I've said that I don't like the way bread machine bread turns out, so I baked this in my oven. I set my bread machine on the dough cycle, followed the recipe and then put the dough in a greased stoneware loaf pan and let rise for about an hour. Then I baked at 350 for 10 minutes, rotated the pan 180 degrees, and baked for another 10 minutes. It came out perfectly. I wouldn't recommend doing what I did on the first loaf - I sprinkled flax seed on the top, because I thought it would be pretty. Unfortunately, they just don't stick. I'll just throw a handful into the mix next time. \r\n\r\nAnd, if you're unfamiliar with flax, you should know that it really should be ground up well. Your body cannot digest whole flax seed and you will not get the benefit of the flax unless you chew it up completely. It's much easier, and beneficial to grind it in a coffee grinder.\r\n\r\nThanks for a hearty, dense winter bread recipe Erna!",

                "reviewBody": "I've just spent 16 hours trying to make this bread. I realized early on that there isn't enough yeast in this recipe but decided to make it as is. Well after mixing it together and letting it \"rise\" for 2 hours nothing had happened. Since it was evening I figured I could lose nothing by letting it sit in my lighted oven overnight. Yay! it had risen when I checked it in the morning. So then I punched it down and had to let it do the slow rise again in the bread pan. I gave it about 2 1/2 hours and by the end of that time it had risen to the top of the pan but didn't have a bread dome. I baked it for about 30 minutes at 350 in a glass loaf pan. It looks in both composition and texture like a sweet bread. I don't like the initial taste that I've had but I will give it another chance when it's cool. If I make it again it will take some major tweaking.",
