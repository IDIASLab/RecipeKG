Then when I threw the bacon in with the beans the onions went in too. Combined with the garlic it gave it just the flavors it needed. \nIt was such a hit everyone was asking for the recipe!",

I would not change a thing to the ingredients but had to make some slight adjustments to the cooking times. I needed to cook the beans much longer than 3 minutes to thaw them. Also when I put the feta cheese and beans in at the same time the cheese melted before the beans were hot enough. This resulted in the cheese turning in to a big glob that I had to cool and tear apart. I think next time I would cook the beans with the onion powder and pepper and then add the cheese when the beans are hot enough. It was delicious though. Everyone who tried it loved it and I gave the recipe out to several people.",

Hubs would have no part of it but part of the beauty of this recipe was that it was easy enough to accomodate both of us. I used fresh green beans rather than the frozen not that I wouldn't have used the frozen if fresh weren't available. I threw some finely chopped onion in with the bacon and garlic and so omitted the onion powder. To finish I didn't mix the feta cheese into the beans because simply put I didn't like that idea. I just sprinkled some of the feta over the top upon serving. Unusual and delicious with quite a nice presentation particularly for just...green beans. Great recipe and certainly best if not cooked beyond crisp-tender.",
