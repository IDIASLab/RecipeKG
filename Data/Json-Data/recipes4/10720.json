To begin with, as I was measuring out the carrots, I stopped at about 1/4 cup, thinking that using a full cup of carrots would be waaaaay too much.  I filled the remainder of the 1-cup measuring cup with celery and we loved the addition/substitution.  With not much in the way of diverse and complex flavors going on here, I thought it was important to make the very most of the flavors I DID have - namely, substituting a good chicken broth for the water and chicken bouillion called for and adding fresh minced garlic to the onions as they were being sweated out.  Finely, while straight Cheddar is inarguably the best for flavor, replacing half of it with processed cheese (i.e. Velveeta) ensures a rich creaminess that is virtually guaranteed not to break down and separate.  Several good shakes of salt and freshly ground pepper and we were rewarded with a rich, creamy, flavorful and comforting broccoli cheese soup.  I garnished it with a crostini topped with a sprinkle of grated Cheddar cheese and a tiny broccoli floret.  This, along with \"Greek Chicken Wraps,\" also from this site, was a nourishing, easy, and laid back supper.",

A few changes: I was out of carrots, though I didn't miss them I'm sure they would have added a great flavor. I used homemade chicken stock instead of boullion. I also used my immersion blender to blend the broccoli/stock mixture. Lastly, after reading the reviews that it was too thick, I used equal amount of chicken stock and milk and the consistency was perfect. I will make this again, and again, and again...",

It didn't taste much like cheese (I didn't use sharp; sharp recomended) but it was still very good. I used 1 bouillon cube instead of the 1 tsp granuals. This recipe is also very adaptable. I have substituted potatoes and celery for the broccoli and left out the cheese to make a wonderful potato soup. Add a can of minced clams for clam chowder. Plus it is easy to adjust the yield; simply add more vegetables bouillon and milk.",

If there are concerns about texture breakdown, whisking the cheese in gradually instead of adding all at once ensures a perfectly smooth texture.",
