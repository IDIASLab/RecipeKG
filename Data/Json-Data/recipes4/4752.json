I didn't use the ground beef (there was plenty of meat between the two types of sausage) I also only used 3 cans of diced tomatoes and I used tomato puree b/c I didn't have any tomato sauce. Oh and I also upped the wine to 1 full cup (it really boosted the flavor). Anyway its a great recipe and it makes a ton so you're able to freeze it and use later for a quick dinner.",
