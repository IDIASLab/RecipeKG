I did take the advise of other cooks who recommended increasing the milk to 1/4 cup and adding a teaspoon of some sort of seasoning (I've used Bruci's on one occasion and Italian Seasoning on another) to give the gravy some oomph.  I haven't had a problem with the chicken getting dry, but I make sure that the meat stays covered by the gravy by giving it a stir every once in a while throughout the day.  It's possible that by putting the chicken into the pot while the meat was still frozen had something to do with the retention of moisture, too.  The recipe can be made in half the time by increasing the temperature to \"high\" and cooking for 3-4 hours.",

The next thing I noticed is that it had a ton of sauce so I added 1 cup of Brown Rice and 1/2 cup of Shelled Edamame.  After tasting it I felt it still needed a little something so I added 1/4 cup of Shredded Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago cheese blend.  YUMMY!!!   This is gonna be a winner for us! THANKS!",

                "reviewBody": "I changed this a bit, doing something some slow cooker people might not like: adding an extra pan.  I browned my chicken first (5 pieces) in a big SS skillet.  Season with your favorite spice blend (I used a mix of Lawry's & Mrs. Dash).  Brown on med/med high heat, and then transfer to SC.  I then added about 2TBS butter, and a cup of chopped fresh onion (omit dried).  Drop heat a bit and sautee that about a min or two and add a carton of fresh chopped mushrooms (omit canned) and sautee some more.  Increase wine to about 1/2 cup and add to deglaze pan.  Get wine roiling pretty good, scrape bottom, and add spices (parsley, salt, garlic, pepper, etc).  I then added 2 cans of 'cream of' soup (I had mushroom and chicken in the pantry).  Stir that and let simmer for a few min.  Drop heat to low, increase milk to 1/3 cup, and add to mix.  Stir to incorporate, and then pour over chicken in slow cooker, moving things around to get good coverage.  Cook on low or high as directed, though I think 4-5 hours on low should be enough since you've already browned the chicken... caveat emptor: be aware of how your slow cooker works.  I liked this served over rice with a side of English peas.  Some things I might try next time are adding a few TBS of capers, and/or switching to pearl onions added with mushrooms after deglazing pan.  If you don't mind the extra pan and just a little extra prep time, I think this really works.",

(I wrote this review a while back but i have made this dish over and over since then. take time 2 brown the chicken its worth the effort. fresh diced onion is key. but the best tip i discovered is 2 add half a pack of powdered ranch dressing mix into the liquid ingredients.) screw u culinary hags & grads.

I doubled recipe to 8 breasts which I cut into 1-2\" wide strips due to limited amount of cooktime I had before dinnertime. Added two sliced garlic cloves a cup of chopped onions and cooked on high for 3 hours. Very tender meat very watery sauce very tasty chicken.
