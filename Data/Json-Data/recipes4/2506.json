I love it with the turkey sausage but have also made it with grilled chicken.   This is now my favorite recipe!!!!",

The boullion and tomatoes make such a light refreshing sauce that really brings out the other flavors! For best results I wouldn't advise subbing dried basil for fresh (flavor goes down to 3-4 stars w/dried). Great presentation/colors too. Perfect for company! Thanks!!!",

I had to use canned tomatoes since my garden is only offering green maters right now. I also left out the green pepper since I don't like it. I used much less olive oil and instead used the juice from the canned tomatoes when I needed more liquid. I can't have cheese right now (and how I love fresh parmesan!) but I don't think the dish suffered at all without it. Don't worry I got my fat grams by using full-on hot Italian PORK sausage. I highly recommend using fresh basil. Fabulous taste and easy to make with a nice zing - a keeper!",
