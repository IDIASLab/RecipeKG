I simmered the sauce until the onions were tender (about 20 mins) then added 1/2 pound of cubed cod (which I had marinated over-night in lemon juice and black pepper). I heated it all until the fish was cooked (about 20 mins again) and served it over pasta with a little grated cheese on top. Delicious! Thanks for the inspiration.",

The first time I accidently used Dutch cinnamon and thought if regular ground cinnamon was used it would be better, but it didn't change the flavor much. It's just only edible and seems like it's going to be good when you first take a bite, but then it goes bland. I tried adding italian seasonings, more worcestershire sauce, more paprika and some dried red chilis, but nothing seemed to help improve the flavor.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed because the reviews seemed good, but my husband says this recipe gets a thumbs down. Quite strange coming from him because he generally likes everything that I make.\r\nWon't be making again. Sorry.",

I followed all the directions except I substituted halibut for the cod and did not use the amount of pepper listed. Whoa! I love black pepper and even I thought that was alot. The stew was already spicy enough. Also this took alot longer to prepare than 5 minutes (between rinsing the fresh herbs and all the chopping) I would make this again though. Definitely warms you up.",

Recommend cooking the pasta or other starch seperately since it absorbs the liquid when refrigerated and gets mushy.",
