Imade a misteak the first time in that when I added the chicken to the water it dropped the temperature too quick that meant it had to stay more than a minute to get back to boiling, which caused a little toughness. When I did it the second time I worked with smaller batches - the temperature stayed High, and the chicken was perfect. Really is like Chinese takeout!",

                "reviewBody": "Velveting is an excellent technique and a must for making the closest one can get to how the better American Chinese restaurants achieve their excellent results. When I was a very young cook I worked in a bistro. One of our very popular dishes was a basic chicken stir fry made with mushrooms onions and pea pods served over rice pilaf. Customers loved it. It was a very simply dish and the reason why is because we did a simpler modified velveting to the chicken we used. We cut chicken breasts into about 1 inch cubes. Then we made a basic velveting slurry with cornstarch salt wine and a bit of cognac. The chicken was mixed into the slurry and portioned and then refridgerated for the lunch rush. Over the many years I had forgotten about velveting until I remembered it years later. I now use a very similar basic velveting recipe of cornstarch with a good wine fortified wine of mix some good wine with cognac to fortify it yourself. Once you have the basic recipe you can then experiment with other flavors of seasoning or alcohols. The basic 30 minute \"marinate\" time allows the chemistry of the velveting mix to do it's magic. An important thing to remember about velveting is that this not a traditional marinade where the meat sits in a distinct liquid. And velveting is not brining. In brining the liquid is made extremely salty on purpose. The reason is to create a highly saline solution that has a much higher salinity than the meat being brined. The rea",

REALLY.  \n\nHowever, I made some changes to the recipe. I didn't have rice vinegar so I used white vinegar.  I didn't have peanut oil, so I used olive oil. I figured vinegar is vinegar and oil is oil when your going to rinse it off anyway, or use it in boiling water. \n\nThe changes did not change the outcome.  I've always wondered how they made the beef and pork so, well, velvety.  Now I know and I'll never not use this for Chinese cuisine, any recipe with sliced beef or pork again.  I actually velveted  beef,  pork, and chicken. It worked famously!!!!\n\nI was planning to make pork fried rice and now I can't wait!",
