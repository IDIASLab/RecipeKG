I used shredded Swiss cheese instead of cubed, and I did not use reduced-fat soup or reduced-fat sour cream because I had some regular sour cream to use up and my local grocery store doesn't carry reduced fat cream of chicken soup (I'm not kidding). Also, I mixed everything together first (except for the topping) before putting it in the casserole dish instead of just putting it on top of the pasta, then I put the topping on. The topping is very good. It's similar to the topping I use on other casseroles, but I never thought to put Parmesan cheese in it before...duh. I will make this again for sure!",

My family loved it.  Here's the thing, I found it to be very dry.  Some of the noodles get hard (to the point of being inedible).  So I served around them. I quickly made a roux, added milk, sour cream, chicken broth and then stirred in some more cheese until it melted.  It took 5 minutes and it was a great \"side of sauce\".  With the extra sauce, this was sooooooo delicious.  If I rated this recipe lower because it was dry and others did the same, no one would make it and that would be too bad because it is really very good.  To me, this is a minor tweak as opposed to some of the reviews I have read that make major changes to the recipe making it in essence a whole new dish.  So...5 stars for this casserole, just double the sauce.",

Like a few others who have posted reviews I too used the normal chicken of cream soup. I also used a full cup of fat free milk and a full cup of sour cream.. I definitely wanted to make sure it was nice and creamy! I also used Kraft's mozzarella cheese with a touch of Philadelphia.. just to be naughty. Also included two table spoons of onions. Love onions! Because I added a little extra than what was specified I cooked it for about 10 more minutes. Turned out DELICIOUS. Very happy with this recipe! I definitely get that this was a healthy alternative.. I was just feeling a bit spontaneous when I made it. Five stars!",
