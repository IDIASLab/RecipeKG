I used my regular recipe which is very simular to this one with the exception that I add, diced peppers and a heaping tablespoon of horseradish to the filling.  This gives it a nice little nip.  I noticed that everyone cooks their cabbage.  You dont need to do that.  When you buy your cabbage make sure its clean then put it in a clean bag and tie it up and put in freezer for a few days.  The night before you are going to make your rolls, take cabbage out of freezer, leave in bag and put in deep dish.  It will thaw over night and the leaves will just fall off.  I use to hate making rolls because having to cook the cabbage.  Now I love making them even more.  Hope this helps everyone out.",

(Cut the thick stem out for better rolling)  I also think if it's par-boiled it de-gases the cabbage.  Do add a good quality 1-2 TSP of Hungarian Paprika to this, and 2 cloves of fresh garlic as well. I place them seam side down  & I cover the rolls with tomato sauce then sauerkraut and instead of the water for the Cabbage Rolls to simmer in I use tomato juice.  Ready in 2 hours! Serve with a dollop of sour cream!Excellent.",

So this recipe was our last try at the cabbage rolls and it was a hit! My husband and my 5 & 6 year old boys ate them up; they were also enjoyed the next day for lunch. We have made these twice now and are making them tonight. (Edit) after making this again I followed the recipe as stated not so good we threw them out. I realized too late I went through most of the reviews the first time before making. Going forward I will (as I did the first few times according to my notes) par cook the rice and season the beef with garlic and Hungarian paprika. Then will cook in a casserole dish with beef broth (NOT water) at 325 for 3 hours or cook them in the Crock pot with less broth or just the juice from the sauerkraut if there is enough on low for 6 hours. Made this way I would give 5 stars but after following the recipe exactly I am knocking it down to 3",
