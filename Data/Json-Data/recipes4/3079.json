The only change was that I added some pieces of chicken to the soup - that is how we've always made our pozole, a mix of pork/chicken.  And I add a bit more fresh diced garlic since we love it.  We serve our soup in a big bowl, add a scoop of refried beans( it thickens the soup) and add condiments - chopped onion/green onion/chopped cilantro/a pinch of oregano/a twist of some lemon or lime slices to taste.  Delicious, filling, comfort food.  Serve all year - not just for New Year!",

Being what I call a 'Throw Together' recipe (something you make from premade, usually canned seasoned items), this is really quite good. My entire family loved it. My father-in-law even duped my mother-in-law's dinner plans to stay for the soup (gotta love that!) and had several servings. I'd say, that makes this a pretty good recipe!! Thanks for sharing a much quicker version of this great soup!",

I only added a cup and a half of water, 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne, 1/4 teaspoon of cumin (instead of 1/2 teaspoon cayenne), mild enchilada sauce (still very spicy), only 1 and a half cups water, and 1/2 cup of cilantro.  When I served it, I served it with lime and chili refried beans, cheese, sour cream, and chives.  I am from Santa Fe New Mexico and have had many versions of Posole, and I think this is the best!

Even called is family to say how good I can make pozole. Next time I may leave out the onions. It added to the flavor, but the onion slices aren't traditional and threw us off a bit. I also made this a little more simpler by eliminating the step of cubing the meat. I added a whole pork loin.  It falls about eventually, so I didn't see the need for cutting it. I also added more hominy and a packet of Goya Sazon seasoning (that stuff is great in/on almost everything, it's a secret ingredient I use often).",
