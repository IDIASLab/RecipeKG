For marinara sauce heat a couple of tbs of olive oil & saute crushed garlic and finely chopped 1/2 onion.  Add 1 large can of tomato puree, 1/2 can of water, basil, (additional garlic powder and onion powder, & italian spices if you wish), 1 whole carrot which you will remove before serving(this is to remove the bitter taste of some tomatoes & lessen the need to add sugar).  Cook on low for about 1/2 hour.  Add grated Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese to taste, additional salt & pepper and that's it.  Very simple.  To make a meat sauce, just brown ground beef or meatball mix, pour off the fat and add to the sauce.  You don't have to buy jarred sauce which is loaded with sugar and thickeners.  If you really need a sweeter sauce you can add some sugar, but I never do.  The jar sauce is just too sweet.\n\nand I  believe the cheese sauce is velveeta or cheese wiz.  I use grated italian cheese. Can't imagine using cheese wiz!",
