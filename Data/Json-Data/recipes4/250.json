I ended up eating most of them because I hated to see them go to waste. Mine were really crumbly and didn't stay together too well. I did like the taste and texture but probably won't attempt these again unless I have a specific request. I have found other recipes with similar ingredients that sound promising. Maybe I'll give them a shot as well. Thanks anyway.",

Also I think the ratio of flour to cheese is off in this recipe so I added a little more cheese. I think the secret here is to make a workable dough. If your dough is not workable add more flour or if its too dry add a sprinkling of water. A little baking powder helps them not be so flat.",
