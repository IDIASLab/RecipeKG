I halved the recipe -- specifically because I wasn't sure whether anyone would like them -- but other than that I followed it to the letter. My \"analysis\"? I was actually surprised (and very pleased) at how good they actually were! DH and Daughter liked them very much and gave me the \"go ahead\" to make them again (and often) but both my son and I thought that they were a bit dry. Next time I make them I think I'll add a little more applesauce. AND I think I'll make a double batch lol. (Note: In addition to the applesauce and bananas I used Blueberries. They worked very well in this recipe.)",

I adjusted the recipe a little, adding 1/2 cup of applesauce, 3 cups of frozen fruit (blueberries & blackberries), 3 tps of cinnamon, 1/2 tps of nutmeg, 4 tps of vanilla extract, 1/4 cup of honey and no salt. All other ingredients remained the same. I am going to try the recipe again using all ingredients to see how it turns out. Thank you.",
