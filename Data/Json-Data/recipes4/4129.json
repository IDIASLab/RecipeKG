We had some leftovers of potato salad (with onion lemon and vinegar) from the previous day so I invested 1 in a can of beets and microwaved the remaining baby carrots that were counting days on the bottom of our fridge. As the herrings were hellishly salty I soaked them in water for 20-30 min and only used three pieces. I had some sour cream so I added it to one of the potato layers. I also boiled two eggs and added them on top with a thin layer of mayo a pinch of dried parsley and two (leftover) lemon slices for decoration. I haven't added any more salt nor pepper except for what was already in the potato salad and herrings. It was DIVINE. I will make this many times in the future. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!",
