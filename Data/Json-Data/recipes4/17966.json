I cut the chicken into cubes before marinating it and with the rise, I had to skip skip the cardamom because I didn't have any.  The only other change I made was to make 4 cups of rice rather than six, and even that was a lot more rice than we needed for the chicken mixture. So the one recommendation I would make is to read deuce the amount of rice thanks",

I wished I should have omitted the tomatoes because the flavor of the chicken was so lovely and the canned tomatoes was distracting. I thought I had Jasmine rice but only had long grain white rice. The Jasmine rice texture and flavor would have been much better.\nI substituted dried ground ginger for the fresh. I would do that again and the recipe didn't call for any salt and I did sprinkle the rice and the chicken with salt at the end.\nIt was a hit with my husband and three kids age 11,14 and 16.",
