Then I went back to read several reviews and noticed that most people modified the recipes in some way. What are you rating this recipe when you did not use it as written? So annoying. But here is my review. The loaf turned out very moist but this was b/c there is way too much liquid (it was like meat loaf stew) and the flavor was bland. I should have notice that there is no salt or seasoning in the recipe but I thought 4.5 stars can't be wrong! I would omit the milk season the turkey and change to tomato sauce to kick up the flavor.",
