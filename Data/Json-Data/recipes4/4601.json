                "reviewBody": "As written the recipe needs a little work but with some minor changes it is easily improved to 4-star status.  First, don't assume 12 minutes in the microwave is accurate for your spaghetti squash!  The recipe doesn't specify the size but given the 6-serving yield and fairly large amounts of the other ingredients, I'm assuming the submitter meant \"1 LARGE spaghetti squash.\" If you use anything smaller, microwaving this for 12 minutes will be far too long and you will not obtain the desirable long strands. For ease in preparation and out of curiosity, this was the first time I cooked spaghetti squash in the microwave and I learned just how quickly it can overcook!  I used sweet red bell pepper, rather than green, and with \"primavera\" in its title I didn't find feta cheese the best choice - I used fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano. Also in keeping with \"primavera,\" and since I had them available, I used fresh herbs for the dried seasoning.  Finally, it is not necessary to cook the onions separately, before adding the zucchini and peppers. I cooked all three together, but did not OVERcook, then added the garlic, the tomatoes and finally the fresh herbs. Again, if you use a modest-sized spaghetti squash, DO adjust not only the cooking time, but the amounts of the other ingredients, accordingly. (I didn't use nearly close to 1-1/2 cups of chopped tomato, for example)",

                "reviewBody": "I've made this twice. The first time I cooked the spaghetti squash in the oven (see Spaghetti Squash I on this site) because I already had the oven on for something else. This time I followed these directions using an average size squash and it was WAY overcooked after only 10 minutes in the microwave. It was no longer stringy like spaghetti and was very mushy. I didn't have any green pepper so I substituted baby bella mushrooms and that worked so well that I'll use them every time. I also added a bit more seasoning and used only half an onion because we feel like too much onion overpowers the other ingredients. The flavor of this dish was really good even though the dish lacked eye appeal and lost some texture due to the overcooked spaghetti squash. Next time I think I'll cook it for only 8 minutes or in the oven if I have time. BTW you can use canned tomatoes (no added sugar! yuk!) and it's as good as fresh winter tomatoes from the grocery and very economical. (Don't compare with fresh summer tomatoes from the garden or farmer's market of course.) Overall good dish. Just adjust the cooking time in the microwave.",

Put chicken in the pan and seared in a little EVOO and deglazed the pan with some sherry and set that aside.  Then added zucchini and mushrooms and sauteed for a few minutes on high heat added 1/4 cup h2o covered and simmered 2 min.  Uncovered and put all ingredients in pan and added two cans diced tomatoes and chicken broth.  Cooked down and served with parmesean cheese.  AMAZING!!!  Also cooked the squash in the oven.  Cut it in half, seeded it, placed on a cookie sheet face down.  Placed in half inch of water and baked at 375 for an hour.  Was done al dente and perfect!!  Also saved the seeds and roasted like pumpkin seeds, a little bonus with the meal mmmm!",
