We used boneless skinless chx breasts and my husband said the chicken was tough (try covering it in foil if you do bnless/sknless chx for the first half or more of cooking) and the sauce had little flavor. I didn't try the chx but tried the sauce and thought it was b-o-r-i-n-g! It needs more....EVERYTHING! Cayenne brown sugar worcestershire more flavor in general. It tasted like vinegar and tomato sauce. Sorry dear but next time I'll use one of Steven Raichlen's recipes...y'know the KING of bbq?? Now that man knows how to make a sauce! We won't be trying this again. Big disappointment.",
