We prepared these exactly as written and they are absolutely perfect. They took 14 minutes on convection bake in my oven. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and the coconut breading was crunchy and very flavorful, but not overly sweet. I found a copy-cat recipe on-line for Outback's sauce that they serve with these - 1/2 cup orange marmalade, 2 teaspoons stone ground mustard with seeds, 1 teaspoon prepared horseradish and a dash of salt. It really does taste exactly like Outback's. We will be making and enjoying these often. Thanks for sharing!",

I did everything as stated in the recipe, except that I cut down the amount of coconut in an effort to save on sugar and calories (a little coconut goes a long way)...not to mention, I wanted to save those calories for my sauce!  I mixed sugar free apricot preserves, horseradish and dijon mustard (can't remember the measurements...just did it all to taste), and it was a great combination.  I think next time I may add a bit more Cayenne pepper to the cornstarch mixture, since I like things pretty hot, but other than that think the recipe is perfect as is. :)  Thanks for sharing!!!",

The only drawback was that this is very messy to make, at least for me.  But, the results were worth it, so give it a try!!",
