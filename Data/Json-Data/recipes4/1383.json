I have been using something very similar as a filling for Dosas for years. dry roasting the spices takes a couple of times to get it down..particularly if you don't have access to fresher ingredients. A couple of things to consider are obviously if you have an indian market in your community they will almost always have their own fresh made curry powders and if you explain what you want (using Steve's ingredients) it's like they will have it or something similar. Most supermarkets now have pre-made indian spices like Garam Masala (which adds things like Cardamom Cloves Nutmeg)...which is not the same but also a nice flavour. In both cases you can dry roast the powder of add some of the gee to make a paste and then heat that until it starts to get aromatic - but if so you must use ghee as you may not notice if you use regular butter and it starts to burn..Ghee has a higher smoke point. NEVER EVER USE THE MASS MARKET DREAD YELLOW POWDER THEY CALL CURRY POWDER!!!!! It's an abomination and the reason why so many people hate curries they think it is that and it is NOT!!! In India (and Sri Lanka as well as other communtiies that share the ethnic and culinary background) almsot every family has their won curry recipe that is handed down for generations and has it's own special proportions and mix of spices. I had Tamil friends in Malaysia whose grandmother shared her 'formula' with me...it was a great sign of acceptance.",

The potatoes took forever to cook but they did eventually (30 minutes of constant simmering later!). For the person who said they didn't have a grinder what you can do is roast the seeds and then place them in foil. Fold the foil up then take a rolling pin and crush them through the foil. It works pretty much the same. That's what I did because my grinder cannot grind small amounts.",
