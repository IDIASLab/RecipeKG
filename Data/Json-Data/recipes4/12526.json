You could probably add some fresh squeezed orange juice to moisten as well. I added in some ground cinnamon and I would suggest cutting down on the scallions so the onion flavor isn't as strong. Overall this is an easy fast and healthly salad to make esp. if you use whole wheat couscous. It is very pretty and the textures interplay well.",

Like others I cut the amount of cumin down to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. of curry powder. Instead of dried apricots I added an 11 oz. can of mandarin oranges. I did find it to be a bit dry so I did add a little more orange juice. What a quick and easy side dish that tastes like you spent hours! Tastes great room temp. or chilled - Thanks for a great recipe!",
