After decades of meatloaf making :) you grow to recognize how much wet and how much dry ingredients you'll need.  The half cup of bread crumbs was just fine (up to 2/3 cup would have been okay), but two eggs and a half cup of barbecue sauce (or milk, or ketchup, or whatever wet ingredient you choose to use) is an amount better suited for two pounds of meat, not one! Also, Worcestershire sauce has a distinct flavor and shouldn't be overdone - half the amount was just right for our tastes - 1-1/2 tsp.  I skipped the optional chili powder because I was so enthusiastic about the flavors of BBQ sauce, oregano and Dijon - not to mention the bacon! - and I felt the chili powder would be an unneccessary distraction rather than a positive contribution.  I used a meatloaf mix (beef, veal, pork) and added some chopped celery along with the onion - and of course I seasoned this well with salt and pepper. The bottom line is that this was darned good, an interesting change from the usual meatloaf.",

I have a big family so I used 2 1/2 pounds of meat, used ketchup and BBQ sauce in the meatloaf and also about a tablespoon of hot sauce and omitted the chili powder.  I added green pepper to the onion/garlic saute. After wrapping with the bacon I made a topping mixture of BBQ sauce, ketchup, honey and Brown sugar which I rubbed over the top before baking.  Turned out awesome.  I would have given this 5 stars but you needed some tweeks to make it a really great meatloaf.",

I took other reviewers comments into consideration and tweaked the ingredients a bit. \n\nI wanted to make more than one loaf, so doubled the meat and used about 2lbs of lean ground beef, 1 cup of bread crumbs, a green bell pepper suated in with my onion, 1/2 cup BBQ sauce, and only one egg. I thought it would still be too wet, but it worked out fine. \n\nMy glaze was BBQ sauce, ketchup, and a lil bit of brown sugar.  I thought by making 2lbs we'd have a decent amount of leftovers, but everyone enjoyed it so much and had seconds!\n\nI didnt use a loaf pan. Instead I shaped my loafs in a plastic wrapped loaf pan, turned it out on to a wire a sheet pan, and baked it on an aluminim lined baking sheet, so the fat dripped away, and it was easier to baste.\n\nThanks for the recipe. It was easy to make,  and just needed a few tiny tweaks. Most moist meatloaf I've ever had!  :)",
