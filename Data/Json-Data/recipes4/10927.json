Also I only add a couple of palms full of macaroni noodles because I like it a little on the thin side as opposed to thick stew style. With all those wonderful ingredients it will still be stewish which I love. Great recipe though. I personally do not add cabbage but read that is the actual portuguese style. Here in the islands I have eaten it many ways with macaroni and cabbage without macaroni and only cabbage without cabbage and only pasta but the basics are always in the pot and its always onolicious!!!!
