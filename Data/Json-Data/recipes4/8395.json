Reading all the possible adaptations in the description and in the notes I used ingredients to adhere to my family's diets. I used white rice flour to keep it gluten free and chose to use crushed almonds instead of hemp or poppy seeds. Two teaspoons are not enough for the final step, so I ended up tripling it. I made some with almonds and some with sesame seeds. Thank you for the recipe.",
