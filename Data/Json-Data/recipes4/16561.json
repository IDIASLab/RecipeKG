It is SO good!:) I'm sure it would be excellent with the cream cheese too.:) Also I used leftover corned beef that I had cooked in the crock pot last week for St. Patrick's Day. - Instead of the packaged deli stuff (it was a whole lot cheaper my way too!;-) )",

Since they were already cooked I added them at the end to warm up.  I also added the tarragon at the end, as I believe fresh herbs should be an addition at the end.  I did not add dill seeds, as I did not have any.  Also, I made the soup with the broth and the half & half and adjusted salt and pepper as needed.  I did not feel the need to add the cream cheese and corn starch slurry.  The soup was plenty creamy with the half & half.  The addition of the flour into the butter and onion mix truly adds enough body to the soup, in my opinion.  Overall, it was a great way to use leftover corned beef and cabbage.",
