This took much longer to assemble and prepare than I expected it to and I dirtied so many dishes to make it. I was glad that I read through the recipe before I started or I would have taken even longer to make the dish. All ingredients need to be chopped measured etc. before you begin.",

I have made other tetrazzini recipes before and I liked this one best for ease of preparation and very creamy sauce. Overall a little bland I would have liked a little more herb flavor or maybe a spicy kick but a bit of salt and pepper at the table did the trick. The crunchy topping was pleasant. All around happy votes from the kids and definitely a happy turn on our Thanksgiving leftovers. Those who are off put by the nutmeg I use nutmeg a lot you'd be surprised by its versatility.",

So I made it exactly as written except I omitted the mushrooms and celery and I substituted 1/2 cup of shredded parmesan for the cream cheese. I did everything else as written. It's absolutely delicious and it would have only been better if I'd had the celery mushrooms and cream cheese and followed the recipe exactly.
