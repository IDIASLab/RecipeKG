With the modifications, my family loved this soup including my 3 year old. A great winter time addition that I will make again.",

You can use any combination of veggies that you want cover it with the juice and you have a great soup. I usually use frozen mixed veggies add potatoes onions garlic sometimes cans of black eyed peas white acre field peas butter beans or just about anything you might have in the pantry. I generally just cook up some ground beef or some chicken to add to it. Season it the way you like it. Yum:)",
