I did not follow it exactly because I had shrimp and salmon which was already cooked and seaseoned (nor would I ever buy canned shrimp), but the spinach/garlic/parm/mayo combination was AWESOME! I added some mozzarella cheese to that mixture, but only a handful, I cooked the pizza with the shrimp  and salmon on top, and sprinkled a little more mozzarella on too, because it was weird to me, having a pizza with no cheese in top. The spinach-cream cheese-parm-garlic-mayo mixture was a lot, enough for my two pizzas (which I bake in cast iron skillets because its more like PizzaHut pan pizza).",

The second time I made it I only used about half as much of the cream cheese mix as the reipe called for and added some shredded Monterey jack to the top before baking the whole thing for 15 min. The flavors come together perfectly and the Italian herbs make the kitchen smell like heaven. This is a new addictive favorite!",

If I had to do it over again I would cook the crust first then layer and place in the oven again to give the crust more crunch.However I did have did eat the pizza cold for lunch leftovers at work and it was still yummy.",

I added medium pre-cooked shrimp. Sprinkled Italian shredded cheese blend on top then cooked the pizza for 10 minutes at 400. I let it set for about 5 minutes before slicing. My husband and I really liked it. My husband likes heat so he topped his with green salsa. We didn't use all the spread mixture so I saved the remainder for a heated chip or cracker dip lol!",
