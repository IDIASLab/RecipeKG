My whole house smelled divine while they were simmering! I wasn't sure what the bundles were supposed to look like but for us there was too much puff pastry and not enough mushrooms. The cooking time for the mushrooms was off because it took about 15 to 20 minutes to get it down to what I thought would not be absorbed at all and I drained off a lot of buttery/mushroomy liquid--maybe too much butter? I baked them for about 20 minutes and the bundles still had quite a bit of translucent pastry left but I took them out and let them sit for a while because I had made them ahead of dinner. I put them back in the oven before dinner to finish browning up and that worked well. In fact that would make this a really great dish to serve to company because you could parbake them ahead of time and then stick them back in the oven to finish up just before dinner was to be served. I will try these again because they are gorgeous and perfect for a guest plate! I am wanting to see what others do with this recipe. And I do recommend the sherry! Thanks AshleyV!",

Just made it tonight with a few additions, based on the suggestions of the original poster and other reviewers:\n\n- subbed sherry for the white wine (same amount)\n- doubled the mushroom mixture (which meant all the stuff used to make it too - butter, garlic, and sherry)\n- added a chopped up shallot to the mushroom mixture\n- instead of puff pastry, I used two cans of crescent roll dough\n\nI guess since I made a lot more of the mushroom mixture, it took a bit longer to reduce (maybe around 20 minutes or so). Reducing the sherry is a worth the wait though! I made one batch after reducing it for ~8 minutes or so (similar to the original recipe) and another after it had cooked for ~20 minutes - my husband and I could definitely taste the difference! The second batch was better :)\n\nThanks for an awesome recipe!",

This recipe as is is good base but definitely needs some kind of herb to elevate it a bit more without drastically changing it. My recommendation would be to add dried thyme and cook the mushrooms at high temperature especially once the alcohol is added. Otherwise it will take forever to cook. Other than that this recipe is restaurant level but made easy. Will make it again.",
