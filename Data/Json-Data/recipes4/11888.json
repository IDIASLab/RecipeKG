Because I was feeling too lazy to chop the onion I THINLY sliced the onion and made a bed of it for the chops to lay on and poured the sauce over the top of it all.Once the chops were cooked I strained the drippings and made a sauce by making a roux with 1 T. butter and 1 T. flour then added the drippings. The onions were an added treat (if you don't mind cooked onions). So sweet and tender. Served with Japanese-Style Sesame Green Beans (also on this site), mandarin oranges and plain white rice. WOW. As another suggested, it would be great to mix some of the sauce in with the rice (rather than just piling it on top). SO SO SO Yummy.",

I made it for company tonight (which always makes me a little nervous, trying a new recipe with company coming) but it turned out exactly as I was hoping. The only change I made was to use half soy sauce and half teriyaki sauce instead of all the soy sauce that was called for. It was sweet but not too sweet, and the meat was so moist! It tasted like I had marinated it. I did only end up cooking it for about 40 minutes and it was completely done, even a little more dry than I would have preferred.",

I went an extra mile and marinated the chops for three hours in honey garlic salt and manderain juice. Cooked it covered half the time flipped them and then uncovered it for the final ten to fifteen minutes of baking. The frying part in the recipe DOES help so DO NOT SKIP that part. I served the chops with garlic red potatoes and salad with homemade dressing. Fantastic!!!",

I didn't really measure the honey (I'm sure it was about 3-4Tbs) either but I wouldn't change a thing! I covered with foil for the first 30m then took it off till the meat reached 160 which took about 40m more - my chops were about 1.5\" thick. Delicious! Will be making again! Oh - I didn't brown in the pan first but that's just b/c I didn't want to wash the additional pan.",
