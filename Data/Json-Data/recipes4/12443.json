Usually you'll always have potato flakes on hand. To make it a little....more pleasing I would recommend you use low sodium or organic chicken broth to reconstitute the potatoes and instead of milk you use a little sour cream. You can add what you would to this potato salad to make it more hearty just like you would a regular potato salad like chopped celery eggs and bacon. It's great in a pinch and it's always super filling and it's never the same as it was the last time. GREAT for White Trash Parties!",
