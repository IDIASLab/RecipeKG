I used all the ingredients (scaled them down a bit for our tastes) with one exception--the rice I had was basmati, so I cooked it beforehand.  I ran out of liquid in the pan to finish the cooking process, so I added a little bloody mary mix that I happened to have leftover from New Year's Day, and that made the final touch to this.  My leftovers will be snatched from us by visiting family members!  Thanks, Martha C., for our dinner!",
