The only thing I did different was to bake the roast for 10 minutes at 450 degrees then turn the oven down to 325 and bake it until it got up to temperature. This is a technique I learned in cooking school. Cooking a roast at a very high temperature for a short amount of time (10 minutes) sears the outside of the roast and helps to lock in moisture during the remainder of the cooking. Thanks for the recipe!",

I made it last night for Halloween dinner and paired it with seasonal veggies and cranberry stuffing. It was a perfect combination. The sauce was divine but be prepared for the sweetness. I added about a tablespoon of Thai chili sauce for a spicy kick and couldn t have been happier with the results. I also followed another reviewers advice and let the sauce cool a little to thicken. Because the sauce was so sweet I ended up making gravy on the side in case people didn t like it the gravy wasn t touched once. Gravy not touched. Now that s a triumph.",
