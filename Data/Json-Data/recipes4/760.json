I cut the potatoes into quarters but the cooking time for this recipe, as most people have mentioned, is WAY off. After 50 minutes or so, my potatoes weren't even close to being tender and the rest of my meal was about to get cold so I decided to throw everything in the microwave for 10 minutes- usually, that's how I make my baked potatoes so tender. PERFECT SOLUTION, and I highly recommend it. I now put the baking dish with potatoes, 2 TBS butter, generous drizzle of olive oil, and garlic, herbs, etc. in the microwave for about 15-20 minutes - not only does it taste exactly the same, but it takes a third of the time and your potatoes will be tender, guaranteed. For herbs, I just use 1-2 TBS dried italian seasoning. I also use concentrated lemon juice rather than real lemon. PS - Stir the potatoes every five minutes while microwaving just to make sure they're all coated.",

                "reviewBody": "These were excellent. I was missing the lemon juice, but had everything else. I did switch the cooking method up a bit. I had pretty decent sized red potatoes so instead of just quarters, I had to cut them in to eighths, maybe even a little more. I poured everything into a big ziplock bag and shook it all up. I then arranged the potatoes in a single layer on a cookie sheet. I baked uncovered at 375 for 35 minutes and they were perfectly tender. Maybe I cute mine smaller than others, but that amout of time was perfect, they were nice and brown on the outside and mushed just enough on the inside. If you bake on a cookie sheet instead of in a baking dish, I do recommend turning once about halfway through.",
