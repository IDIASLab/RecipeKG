Only problem is that it ended up being a little salty which is weird since I didn't add any salt at all. Likely from the veggie stock. I doubled the veggie stock and just used two cups water. Next time (and there will be a next time very soon) I will amend that as per the recipe. Thanks for this excellent recipe!",
