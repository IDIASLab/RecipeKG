First, I thought i had pressed the biscuit dough thin in the muffin pan, but there was a lot of biscuit at the bottom.  Next time, I will press the biscuits even flatter, reaching further above the mufin pan.  That will allow for more goo inside.  :-)   I also thought the mixture was a little too salty.  I might cut back on the garlic salt a little next time.  The flavor was good, but just too salty for my taste.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken and it worked great,",

That being said, they did come together in no time (I used cream of mushroom soup in place of cream of chicken and the entire 12oz bag of frozen mixed veggies) using previously grilled chicken.  These took 19 minutes for me, and they should have stayed in longer, but I couldn't wait to eat any longer.  These were pretty good.  Not something I'd crave or purposefully make for the two of us, but would recommend for a quick weeknight meal.  However, it was really salty, and I love salt, so I'd recommend reducing the garlic salt to 1/2 tsp.  THANKS for the recipe!",

I did lightly saut\u00e9 half a yellow onion and one stalk of celery because I like the crunch it adds to a pot pie. I also made my own cream of soup rather than use the canned version. I had 2 packages of biscuits so I got 20 little pies. My husband loved them and proceeded to eat 6 of them for dinner. Mine were done at the 12 minute mark. I completely cooled then individually wrapped the leftovers and froze them. I will reheat in the toaster oven when I go to finish them up. I would make these again and I think kids would really enjoy the individual servings. Easy to add ingredients to your liking.",

Using broccoli cheese soup gave it a fantastic flavor that went well with the vegetables. I seasoned with garlic powder onion powder and no salt seasoning from Costco. I added no additional salt. These would be great to use with a variety of meats. Or to make vegetarian you could add tofu. These were easy fast and cheap to make. I will definitely be making them again soon. My husband liked them so much he said he would be happy to eat them every week.",

I was worried about the doughy result given a full biscuit for each pie, so I used crescent dough instead which gave me a lot more room for the yummy chicken goodness.  I actually ran out of filling, so ended up with only 10 pies.  For the filling I thought it was salty as well, so I just added the onion powder and garlic powder (not salt) with some crushed pepper.  Fresh veggies on hand instead of frozen worked great.  I did not like all the cheese calories and fat, so I just sprinkled cheese on top and my son lovesFrench's crunchy onions, so I added that on some without the cheese to see if they liked that better.  It was about the same.",
