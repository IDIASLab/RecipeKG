My original recipe called for a dash of fresh cayanne pepper which is very tasty with the combination of flavors.  I always have to double this recipe and this year I should have tripled it.  I had a lot of visitors this holiday season and even those that don't care for spinach tried and liked this appetizer.  I baked these for 13 minutes; cooled completely; stored in an air tight container and refrigerated.  When I wanted to serve, I baked spinach balls on a cookie sheet for 10 minutes at 350 and served warm.  Perfect!",

Definitely plan on 3 bites per person many had more. We made them on Wednesday cooled and stored them in large zip lock bags. We thawed and reheated them for the wedding on Saturday night.

About 2 cups of Italian bread crumbs instead of the 5 cups it said. I also adjusted the butter and eggs. Otherwise it would have been too mushy. Even with less butter it still was a bit too much. The way I made them they turned out perfect. The prep and cooking time was longer though. I put the spinach in the toaster oven to dry it out easier and I ended up baking these for about 30 minutes instead of 20. This recipe is a good guide though.",
