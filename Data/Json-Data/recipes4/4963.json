I think it would have worked better with a pork shoulder cut (not as lean a cut of meat) intended for these longer cooking times.  I would also cut back on the chicken broth to perhaps only 1/2 to 3/4 cup.  The horseradish mustard gave it a nice kick.  I would also sear the meat before adding it to the slow cooker (simply personal preference for a browner roast) and add a bit ot garlic and thyme to the \"rub\".  I may try this one again with the above modifcations.",

Layer of potatoes then layer of pork cover with kraut then another layer of potatoes. about 3 layers for a roasting pan. Have tried it with various types of pork which is quite important to the taste. Side ribs are what seem best. Have tried with loin but just isn't quite right. Potatoes should be a russet variety. And the kraut has to be a salt cure not a wine cure. The wine cure really ruins the dish. You may want additional salt as the potatoes kill that but only after serving. Black pepper fresh coarse ground when putting together and a bit after works well. When done this really is a fantastic winter comfort food. If you like salty kraut pork and potatoes then try this or one of the versions you will find one that works and will never be able to make it enough to satisfy your taste for it.",
