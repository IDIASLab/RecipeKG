But I liked the ingredients so tried again with chicken broth and absolutely loved it.  Just fantastic!  I made some slight modifications to the recipe--I used a full 8 oz package of mushrooms and two stalks of leeks (this is probably about what the recipe calls for). Used a 50oz can of chicken broth and added about 2.5 cups of water. Will make it exactly the same way next time.",

As written this is an average soup in my opinion worthy of three stars - it lacks flavor in a big way. Having said that I added garlic to the mushrooms and leeks and threw in a handful of fresh parsley chives and thyme. Rather than the condensed beef broth and water I used equal amounts of beef and chicken broth. Hubby liked this better than I did which surprised me since he typically likes heartier soups which this is not. He suggested this might be even better with some chopped green onion to serve and I agree. The embellishments of garlic and fresh herbs upped this 3-star recipe to four stars but was still rather nondescript. We enjoyed it but I'm not sure I'll make it again.",
