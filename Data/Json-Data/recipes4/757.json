Curious I measured it out in a prep bowl to see just how much that amount of seasoning looked like and was amazed--if I didn't know better I would think there was a misprint in the recipe. On the other hand there is nothing extraordinary at all about green beans with butter and almonds which would have made this only average at best even using a more realistic measure of the lemon pepper seasoning.",
