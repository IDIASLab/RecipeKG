Then I refridgerated it in a bag for an hour, but I think it would have been fine without. Then I poured some Progresso Italian Bread Crumbs into the bag and shook it until coated. Baked at 425 for 45 mintues. It was mouthwatering. Served with mashed potatoes and peas and it was a huge hit with almost no work. Try it!",

I coated the tenderloin with oil and made homemade bread crumbs as my girls can't eat most storebought crumbs as they have milk intolerances. I mixed in oregano, basil, rosemary, onion and garlic powder. This was the most moist pork I've ever had. Do place it on a sheet of tinfoil to keep from having to scrub the pan and tent it with tinfoil, because it burns within a few minutes if left uncovered. Uncover during the last few minutes to brown crust. It certainly helps to have it stand at the end. Overall, it was just terrific",

                "reviewBody": "Original Review Dec 2003: This was an incredibly quick and easy recipe.  The presentation is beautiful and it was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of sprinkling the tenderloins with a little garlic powder and black pepper prior to breading.  It does seem to be a lot of breading, but the crumbs contain all the flavor, and using the amount called for ensures you have enough left for a nice breading after slicing.  Line your pan with foil -- the meat won't stick and you won't have a pan to wash! :)  Update - Feb 2009:  I've made this so many times and just wanted to add that I try to remove from the oven when the internal temp is 145 because USDA guidelines for whole pieces of pork have changed since my original review.  Because pork tenderloins are so lean, you don't want to overcook them as they can easily dry out. A bit of pink is good in this instance! Use a meat thermometer and remove when temp hits 145. Keep in mind that the internal temp will rise a few degrees during the standing process. So juicy, tender and delicious! One of our favorite recipes!",

First, you do have to spruce up the Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I always doctor them up with a bit of garlic, parsley, italian seasoning, crushed rosemary, and Parmesan cheese.  I eyeball everything and mix it together. Now, instead of the oil I tried something a little bit different.  I used an egg wash - two eggs with a little milk.  I dipped the tenderloins in the egg and bread crumb mixture twice, essentially \"double dipping\" in order to get a nice thick bread crumb coating.  I sprayed the bottom of the pan with Pam to prevent sticking, put the tendeloins in and took the rest of the egg and breadcrumb mixture combined them forming a stuffing mixture and layed that into the pan as well.  I sprayed a little Pam over everything, baked the tenderloins at 400 for 20 minutes, turned them and baked for another 25 minutes.  They were moist, tender, and juicy - perfect.  There's nothing worse than dried out pork!",

I marinated it for 2 hours in a baggie of olive oil, mustard, crushed garlic, salt & pepper & some sliced green onions.\n\nThen I put the breadcrumbs in a large baggie, placed the tenderloin in & shook it up til it was coated. I baked at 425 covered w/ tented foil. Baked 1/2 hr & then removed foil. Baked til it registered 145 degrees. Let it rest for 10 mins & it was very tender & flavorful. My very picky chef father in law was impressed! I served w/ roast potatoes, salad & leftover green bean casserole we had yesterday (Easter). Thanks for the inspiration!",

Secondly, today's pork is no longer slop-fed like years ago so it does NOT have to be cooked to 165! I tried this recipe and it was too dry without sauce.The fact is with such a lean cut, never cook boneless pork loin past 150-155 at the most. Todays pork is grain fed and does not carry the bacteria it once had. Any good restaurant will cook pork loin to medium at the most. And use a thermometer that you can leave in the meat while cooking. The same reason you don't cut the meat for at least 15 minutes after cooking is the same reason you don't poke holes in it with a thermometer. All the juices will leak out. You can get a meat thermometer with the base that sits on the counter for under $ 10.00. For anyone who roasts meat, this is an essential kitchen tool. It will make all the difference in your roasts. I promise!",
