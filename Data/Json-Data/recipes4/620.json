It sounded too simple to be good, but I was wrong to think that. I used 1 can of Campbell's French Onion Soup and 1 can of low sodium beef broth. (There's plenty of sodium already from the Campbell's soup!) When I took the foil off for the last 30 minutes of baking, I added a cup of frozen peas and some chopped scallions. It was perfect. Not too watery and not sticky; just the exact right texture. This was WAY easier than my other fried rice recipes, and just as tasty! I will be making this one again for sure!",

He likes the boxed rice and I won't buy them 'cause they're expensive.  I ended up changing the recipe quite a bit simply because I found it last minute and had to go with what was available.  I used a 14.5 oz can regular strength beef broth, 3/4 c. water, a package of dry onion soup mix, 2 T butter.  I added an extra 1/2 c. rice just based on personal preference-the amount of liquid in the original recipe seemed like a lot.  I had to cook it on the stove as the oven was in use.  Boiled the liquids, soup, and butter, added the rice and turned to medium-low for 15 minutes, then turned off the heat and let it rest for another 15 minutes.  I make all my white rice this way and it turns out great each time.  I don't usually change recipes like that right off the bat, but I had to this time.  Thanks for the recipe!",
