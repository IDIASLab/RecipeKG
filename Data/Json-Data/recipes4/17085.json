Funny, I usually go very light on the dressing, but this unusual dressing seems a bit skimpy, and I would like more apple, too.  B.t.w., I  had to use my stick blender, because the quantity of dressing stayed below my blender blades and wouldn't puree.  Thanks for the idea, I would never have thought of this combination!",

The 2 cups of kale was plenty and a better balance with the large apple and other ingredients IMO.\n\nA perfect and healthy lunch all by itself (I ate the entire salad for lunch) or a wonderful dinner salad.\n\nI will make it again, thank you for sharing.",
