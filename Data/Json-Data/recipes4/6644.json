For the reunion, used a whole jar of the hot fudge sauce on each layer after reading other comments and it worked well. Also took the idea of nuking the sauce for 30 seconds to make the spreading easier. Layered ice cream sandwiches, fudge sauce, Cool Whip and repeated the layers.\n\nFor Bunco, a layer of ice cream sandwiches, caramel topping, Heath Bar bits, Cool Whip, ice cream sandwiches, fudge topping, Cool Whip. A hit, again.\n\nThe best part was that Friendly ice cream novelties were on sale at a local store-buy 2, get 3 free. The following week, Smucker's toppings were a sale item-buy 2, get 1 free. Talk about a delicious, cost effective dessert-I scored!",
