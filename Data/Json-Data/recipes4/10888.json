Adds another dimension of flavor. Another testimonial is that my two year old son who (believe it or not) isn't a big sweets eater (particularly cake-like desserts) munches this right down. It counts as a fruit serving and what's not to love here? YUM!!",

I also had to bake it for longer so it would come together better. I found it easy to serve it the next day after its has been chilled and then just warm it up in the microwave. Goes great with Ice cream. Thanks so much for a great recipe.",
