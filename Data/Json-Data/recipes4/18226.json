I've been told it's an acquired taste, but having grown up on them, I love them! It's a loose meat sandwich. Use a slotted spoon to portion out the meat. Serve on buns with mustard and sliced dill pickles.",

This recipie is almost exact except for the horseradish was approx 3T and the mustard was 2T per 5lb of meat.  This recipie was advertised to be low fat because we removed the extra fat from the juices...here is how we did it.  Add all meat and sauce and cook while \"mashing\" and stirring while it cooks so the meat texture is fine.  Strain all juice off the meat pressing it thru a colander.  Freeze juices.  The fat will rise to the top and harden, it can be cut off and removed.  The remaining juices are pored back over the meat, mixed and heated.  Serve with slotted spoon.  Mustard and pickle..enjoy!",

To the person who said to be sure to drain the beef before adding the \u201csauce\u201d, you aren\u2019t doing it right. The wet mixture goes onto the RAW ground beef and then you cook and stir stir stir. When it is done there will be no discernible sauce. Just loose meat heaven.",
