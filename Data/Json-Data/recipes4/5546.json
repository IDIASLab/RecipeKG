My picky in-laws (but I don't like goat cheese..) loved them, my 13 year-old son (mom, when can we have those grilled vegetables again?...).  Very easy to substitute depending on what veggies you have on hand.  Have made this 5 times, here are my suggestions: slice the onion THICK or they will get lost.  add zucchini (quartered lengthwise) and/or asparagus, eggplant is good also.  MOST IMPORTANT:  PUT SOME BALSAMIC IN YOUR MARINADE, THEN ADD GOOD/HIGH QUALITY BALSAMIC TO SOME OF THE REMAINING MARINADE TO DRIZZLE ON THE GRILLED VEGGIES.  The avacado is optional but the goat cheese and FRESH basil are a must.  Addistional suggestion:  on the chance that you have leftover veggies, cut them up and add to sauteed onion and garlic, throw in a can of diced tomatoes and some grilled, sliced chicken sausage.  Simmer to desired consistancy and serve over pasta with additional cheese.  I now make extra veggies every time, just so we can have the pasta.  Did I mention I like this receipe :)",

I made the recipe exactly as above except I mistakenly added the balsamic vinegar while marinating instead of after grilling - but it was so good I don't think I'd try it the original way. We used the suggested ingredients plus zucchini (quartered lengthwise) yellow bell pepper and eggplant sliced into 1/2\" rounds all good. The red onion is a must it is a wonderful flavor complement to the other veggies. My suggestion make a lot especially if you're feeding more than 3 or 4 people - it'll be a hit.",

I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I used more cayenne (probably around 1/4 tsp - even that wasn't spicy). For the grill seasoning I used Montreal Steak Spice and used slightly less than called for. I'm already dreaming of the next time I can have this! I wouldn't change a thing! I love the sweetness of the peppers combined with the freshness from the basil and creamy goat cheese and avocado. This is the kind of recipe that will thoroughly impress guests.",

I used 3 mushroom caps halved two red bell peppers quartered about 3/4 of a medium red onion 8 or so asparagus stalks and a large avocado. Just about perfect for 4 large helpings. I may have not used the full amount of goat's cheese but rather sprinkled it over the platter of vegetables until I was satisfied with the presentation. Also we grilled the veggies for about 15 minutes on the top shelf of the grill--they would have been underdone at 5 min.",

Despite burning a few of the veggies it turned out wonderfully and was even better for leftovers the next day. Here are my changes: I used a bag of sweet mixed (orange yellow and red) peppers instead of bell mostly because it was cheaper and I wanted more color. I only used 3 mushroom caps which I quartered. I used McCormick montreal steak seasoning for the grill seasoning because it was what I had on hand. I eyed the balsalmic vinegar and probably added a little extra bc I love balsalmic but probably added too much as it got a little too tart the longer it sat- so I'd say use as directed if not less. I also added asparagus as I needed to get rid of some and I skewered the vegetables for the grill. Everything else was the same. Will definitely make again!",
