I cooked this in my slow cooker for one hour on high and another three on low. I'm glad I checked on it because it was done to the point of smooth applesauce with a faint chunk. The flavor is just right for our family the right amount of tart and sweet not too cinnamon-y. When I make this again I'd do what I did before and maybe cut back on the liquid by a half cup and cut the cooking time back by an hour. That's not the recipe's fault we just like a chunkier sauce.

I didn't like the bits of peel from the green apples; I might peel all the apples next time and then not use the food processor (just cut them in small pieces and cook then down). If you \"process until smooth\" you can end up with the consistancy of baby food; I would rather process for a couple seconds and have some applesauce texture left. The cinnamon flavor and red color is nice and makes this a special apple sauce. I also liked the \"Sauteed Apples\" recipe.",

At first I didn't want to try this recipe - I was not interested in adding \"sugar/candies\" to a healthy desert. But then I realized I was probably going to add some sugar to a regular applesauce recipe. I liked this one - because I wanted the cinnamon taste but not the brown color cinnamon lends to the apples. I (surprisingly)couldn't find red hots - so I used a big box of Hot Tamales. I used a whole Fruit Punch Juice box instead of the cranberry cocktail and I peeled the apples. I cooked it on medium-low for about 1/2 hour-45 minutes.",

It's almost fall and I just can't WAIT any longer to make all of my seasonal favs - pumpkin & maple everything (lol!) apple pie / crisp applesauce cider etc. The smell of this while simmering was divine (it does smell like Christmas!)! I must admit it took me 2 batches to get this right.... Having said that I have some CRITICAL tips to help you avoid what I did wrong. I followed the recipe exact on my 1st attempt. My applesauce was nearly mush but b/c I left the skins on I had to briefly pulse in my blender. My KitchenAid is VERY powerful. One pulse (to break down the skins) was enough to turn my \"sauce\" to \"liquid!\" For my 2nd attempt I peeled my apples cooked for 15 min. ONLY (I stopped after step 1) took everything off the burner allowed to cool slightly & then GENTLY mashed w/ a potato masher. My applesauce was still quite smooth but had an ever so slightly chunky texture (perfect!). NOTE: I could not find a bulk-sized bag of red hot candies. My grocer only sells the sm. 2 oz. bottles in the baking aisle at 1.99 ea. (ikes!). I opted to use a lg. box (think movie theater sze.) of Hot Tamales. One box is exactly 2/3 c. For my 2nd batch I used 1 1/2 boxes (there wasn't enough cinnamon flavor in my first one but 1.5 boxes was a bit too much... grr!). Thx. for sharing Jean! I'm glad I tried your recipe.:-)",
