I followed the recipe, though I did use frozen white/yellow sweet corn, as opposed to canned, and I also prepped both pans (the white sauce and the veg) at the same time on different burners to reduce cook time.  I also couldn't resist adding 2 tsps of yellow mustard to the white sauce and I'm glad I did; it really worked well.  This is a very rich and hearty soup.  THANKS for the recipe!",
