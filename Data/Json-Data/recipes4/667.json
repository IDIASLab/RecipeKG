Given that the majority of the reviewers substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise called for I might have done the same. It makes me wonder if so many did that simply because, well, everybody else did.  Then there were others who said this was greasy or bland and made significant changes to the recipe.  I was nervous that since I made this just as the recipe directed that it was going to be a mayonnaisy, greasy, tasteless flop. I needn't have worried, because let me tell you,  this stuff is good!  No, I mean this stuff is GOOD. It is creamy, and chickeny and not greasy and not mayonnaisy (in fact, had I not put it in there myself I wouldn't have even known there was any). This is so nicely flavored, and certainly doesn't require any messing with to make it better. Once out of the oven (believe it or not I just heated it in the microwave for a few minutes and it turned out perfectly!) I plopped some sour cream on the top and sprinkled it with chopped green onion.  This is a dip I'd be proud to take or serve anywhere or anytime I have a need to  make or bring something awesome good.  Perfect, flawless recipe.",

I've noticed that a lot of people have noted that the taste of mayo is a little strong, and some have substituted 8 oz mayo and 8 oz sour cream instead, thinking the recipes calls for 16 oz of mayo. The recipe only calls for 8 oz of mayo total. If you do want to include some sour cream, I would suggest 4 oz mayo and 4 oz sour cream.  Thanks for all the great reviews!",

I also used 8oz of cubed hot Mexican Velveeta green onion & taco sauce to taste instead of the shredded cheddar jalopeno pepper & green chili peppers. Easier & creamier. I guess I pretty much changed the whole recipe but whatever it turned out great. I have had so many compliments & requests for copies of this recipe. Served it with Frito Scoops. You can make it even easier by getting a couple cans of white-meat chicken. Only needed to bake it about 30 minutes. Try it; believe me you'll like it.",

It is just as good as fresh chicken in this recipe and it is easier to break up. I also add a few dashes of chili powder and omit the jalape\u00f1os because I'm not a fan. When I mix the ingedients together I use a hand mixer. It breaks up the big chunks of chicken and really helps blend everything together nicely. Excellent party dish! Serve with Tostitos.",

Was thinking of using it as a quesadilla filling but when that clearly wasn't going to work I was able to use it as a 'cold' filling in a tortilla and roll up and cut into pinwheels. Worked out perfectly. Needed some sprucing up with green onions spices etc....but a good starting point to work from.",
