The only thing I did different was to cook the onion and celery directly in the roux until tender then added the okra (I used frozen becuase I could not find any fresh).

Finally, I added half a teaspoon of dried savory.  And like a previous reviewer, I cooked the vegetables in with the roux, and because I used frozen okra I added it last.  The gumbo is very good.

This was fabulous for New Year's Day. It tasted really good and was not that time-consuming. Don't let making the roux intimidate you. As long as you keep the heat at medium and whisk or stir the whole time you won't burn it before it turns that pretty roux color somewhere between peanut butter and chocolate. I made 6 cups of white rice to accompany this (4 cups chicken broth 2 cups white rice simmered for 20 minutes) and it was the perfect amount. Highly recommend.",
