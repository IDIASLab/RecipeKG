I flattened the chicken to uniform thickness and marinated it for 24 hours in a vaccum sealed container. For the second half of the marinade added a few Tbsp of coconut milk. We then made coconut quinoa instead of the rice. For the corn salsa I used yellow orange and red sweet peppers. I did not have a red onion so we used a quarter cup of a finely chopped yellow sweet onion. I also doubled the marinade so I would have more to pour on top of the completed dish.",

Although excellent next time I will sub. vegetable or canola oil for the olive oil as I could taste the olive oil and I think a neutral flavored oil would be better. Also I feel any type of hot sauce will work for the sriracha. I didn't use red peppers for the corn salsa I used halved cherry tomatoes. Although good I think some additional seasoning would benefit the flavor. I boiled corn on the cob for 3 mins. then cut off to use for the salsa. Canned corn would work too. Not sure if recipe wanted fresh uncooked corn??? The coconut was neither here nor there so definitely optional. Overall as written an excellent recipe that can be tailored to your taste. I did not make this as meal prep we ate it as a full dinner.",
