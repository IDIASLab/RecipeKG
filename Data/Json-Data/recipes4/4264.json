So you have a layer of shredded cabbage salad shredded corned beef all sandwiched between good sourdough. (I like to buy a french baguette from Panera Bread). Yum. Also you can make any kind of vinaigrette you like. Mine was only a suggestion. I currently use the ratio: 3 TBL olive oil 2 TBL red wine vinegar 1 tsp greek oregano and sometimes a pinch of sugar for a sweeter taste.",

Also like other viewers I added swiss cheese and I also sliced some tomatoes for us adults. And I marinated the cabbage ahead of time so it had time to absorb. There was too much cabbage leftover but perhaps that's because I added other things to the sandwich. Next time I will probably half the cabbage and marinade. Overall it was Excellent my kids loved it my husband loved it and I loved it! Great recipe! I will make this again and again.",

I cheated a bit I had some very lean top loin corned beef from the deli. I made my cabbage mixture early in the day and let it sit in the fridge all day to marinate. I used cider vinegar and left out the salt and just kept throwing in shredded cabbage until it reached the right consistency. After I had my sandwich put together I decided to heat it up so put it in my convection microwave on 350 until the Swiss cheese melted. Heating it was a great idea. Served with dill pickle wedges and chips. I'm not waiting until St. Patrick's day to make this great tasting sandwich again.",
