I didn't have white beans so I substituted with butter beans.  It was fine.  Also used a whole red sweet pepper instead of half a yellow one.  And definitely needed some chopped fresh avocado.  Made a great addition to this salad.  Maybe for some extra Mediterranean flair next time I'd also chop up some kalamata olives to add a little punch.  Overall a great recipe.  My husband, who gave up meat entirely for Lent, couldn't stop raving about it.  This one's a keeper.",
