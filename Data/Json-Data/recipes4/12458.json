I followed the recipe except I thought 1 TB seasoned salt was WAY too much so I just used some regular salt (less than a teaspoon) and added some paprika chili powder and cayenne pepper. An extremely easy recipe and it is filling and good. I served some dry cotija cheese to put on top and that was really good. Next time I would maybe add tomatoes or red bell pepper and olives to make it a little prettier; maybe some cilantro too.",

My kids thought it was okay and my husband actually took a bit of the leftovers to eat (in a tortilla) for lunch today but I certainly will not make this again. It reminded me of dog food. The consistency was way too thick it was bland brown in color and all I could taste was the refried beans. Also I think there must be a mistake in this recipe - 1 TABLEspoon of seasoned salt AND 1/4 teaspoon regular salt?? I just used 1 teaspoon of seasoned salt and it was too salty for our taste. Maybe this recipe could be better if you add more water use regular beans instead of refried and use way less salt....",
