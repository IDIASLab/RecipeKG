What I do (and I know not all of us have one) is I freeze a pack of chicken breast. I have a meat slicer. I then shave the chicken while frozen. This is important if you slice the chicken thawed it will fly everywhere. My wife then packages the shaved chicken into 10 oz. portions enough for 2-6 inch subs. Then freezes each package for future meals. You made want to adjust portions depending on what size rolls you're using. If you don't have a meat slicer maybe your butcher will help you out.",
