I followed the recipe pretty much as written but only used 3/4 c. of mayo and added about a tsp of Siracha for a little kick. Also, I toasted (under the broiler) one side of the sliced baquette bread and spread the mixture on the other side then baked them. I liked the bit of crunchiness the toasting did. I will definitely make this recipe again!",
