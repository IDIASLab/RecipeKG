When you blend up all the ingredients,it is a lot of liquid to add to just 2 pounds of ground beef. I was having a large party and I added it to 7 POUNDS of ground beef. I let it sit longer in the fridge too. It didn't dilute the flavor and the meat was formed into patties that stuck together just fine. I really didn't even need the bread cumbs, but I added them just as a precaution. Everyone LOVED them. They were juicy and very flavorful. Thanks a lot!!!!!",

Both times I have done this we have liked the way the taste and grill up better after they are frozen. Go figure! It's great to have a recipe that's not just plain hamburgers once in a while.

Even with the bread the meat mixture is very soft. I tossed one burger on the grill to see what would happen. It started to stick and fall apart right away. I ended up grilling these on non-stick foil over high heat. I agree with the reviewer who said these grill better when you begin with frozen patties. Freezing would certainly keep them from falling apart. The flavor of these is good. The texture is different from a plain burger. Don't expect it to be the same and you won't be disappointed.",
