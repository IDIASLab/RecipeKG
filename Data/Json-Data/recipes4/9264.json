The ingredients all come together in a delicious way. I'm not sure if it's because we used potatoes from our garden that everything turned out so great. We kept to the recipe, except I have a ton of pepper plants and I don't know if any are serranos, but I know that they are hot, so I might have used a thai chili pepper of some sort... Anyhow the result was amazing and the sauce... OMG! The sauce was so flavorful! Definitely keeping this as a regular. Thanks Chef John!",
