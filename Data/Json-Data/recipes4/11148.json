I would suggest not adding the shrimp until about 15 minutes from the end of cooking time - they cook up quickly. Thanks for the recipe!",

It had just the right heat but then.......the cayenne and red pepper were \"to taste\"........my taste:) I used andouille instead of kielbasa. I also spiced up my shrimp as I cooked it and likewise with the chicken. As for the gravy I didnt think it needed anything else but I had cayenne and red pepper in it already along with the salt and pepper. Great one. Thank you!",
