However, the cream cheese did not add anything at all to it, so I would totally eliminate it next time. The cream cheese chunks did not melt, just remained exactly where you placed them before baking, browned on top, and actually did not have much taste. The end result looked like toasted marshmallows on top. For someone like me who does not make French Toast but likes it a lot, this was a good recipe and one I would make it again.",

Spread the mixture on the bread you're using (I used cinnamon-raisin bread) stack the \"frosted\" bread 3 high, then cube it.  I also used real maple syrup.  It is so much better this way as there is cream cheese in every bite and it is sweetened.  1/2 cup syrup just was not enough sweetness for this big batch, IMHO.  I tried it the original way and I prefer it the sweeter way.",

I needed to make something quick and yummy for a faculty breakfast and I needed to make it the night before. I used a whole loaf of French baguette (16 oz.) and as I was chopping up the cream cheese I thought it was a bit much. I ended up using just one 8 oz. package of the cream cheese and it turned out great. I also had to put it in the oven after only about 30 minutes of refrigeration with the egg and it still turned out great. I also added a can of drained blueberries to the top for a little something extra. I got lots of compliments on this recipe and brought back an empty dish!",
