I didn't have soy milk so added some cottage cheese and about 1/4 cup berries. I have had this for 5 days in a row and think I could and will eat it every day for breakfast. EDIT: I first reviewed this 10 months ago and I am still eatin it at least 4-5X a week. It is healthy and fills me up so I'm never snack through the mornings. UPDATE: It's been 2 years and I still eat this at least 4-5X a week with a big spoon of cinnamon mixed in.",

My biggest problem is the flaxseed oil... it does not combine well and looks oily. Not very appetizing. So I used ground flaxseed. I also use skim milk instead of soy since I don't like soy. Otherwise this is certainly a good way to make oatmeal even healthier!",

I can hardly believe that something so good for you can be this filling and taste so good. I followed the directions as written added half a teaspoon of splenda brown sugar (Only 10 calories) and some organic raisins. I also use vanilla soy milk. The result is a decadent almost desert like breakfast that keep me going all morning. I use ground flex instead of the oil but I find the wheat germ and flax has done wonders for my energy.
