I made the bread in the bread maker--it's what I do to multi task most of the time and I added about a 1/2 c more flour to keep it from being too sticky. This was really easy until it came time to get it out of the slow cooker--the recipe submitter's slow cooker must run a bit cooler than mine since I had crust starting to brown and sticking to the slow cooker. So I couldn't really flip it out without trying to cut at the crust which made a mess. Next time I'll use a liner spray more and that should work better. However taste wise it's lovely (for hubs) if you love buffalo chicken. You can really taste it and I used less since I had the \"really hot\" Frank's RedHot. Since hubs loved it and I like how it worked I'll make it again next time making one for hubs with the buffalo chicken and one for me with something else. Thanks for the recipe!",

I also used BBQ sauce because my kids don't like buffalo. I brushed the inside of the pot with coconut oil. It stuck in just one spot but with a hot crock pot it was still really difficult to get it out. Maybe I'll try a thick coat of shortening next time. The one thing we didn't like was that the crust was too big for the pot and folded over the top of the pizza. That was way too much crust. I will cut back on the crust next time and make it smaller or cut off the excess. Very good though!",
