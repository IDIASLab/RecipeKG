My modifications: I used 32 oz of unsalted beef stock and 2.5 cups of water. Also used fresh garlic. Ended up having to add salt at the end, but I'm okay with that, as I'm sure it's still less than what is in fully salted beef stock or beef broth. Will definitely make this again.",

I ended up cutting the meatballs into smaller pieces after my son tried to nab as many as possible, and I think that's one reason my carnivorous husband liked it so much. Very meaty. I tried it w/ the pasta, but the leftovers soaked up all the liquid overnight, so next day, we started over and left it out. It made me remember why I don't put pasta in soups unless guaranteed you will consume all immediately. I would cook pasta separately and add to each bowl if you want it. It was great without to me.",
