My first thought was GROSS but then I read the reviews and pretty much on the whole they were saying that this was a perfect compliment to a Jamaican Jerk recipe. So I thought I would give it whirl. I'm really glad that I did...and it was a perfect compliment to Jay's Jerk Chicken from this site. Only one person out of the five I made it for didn't like it...and that was solely because she doesn't like bananas. We won't count her...LOL!
