The sauce is a bit overpowering the seafood; I ended up cutting the whole milk down to 3/4 cup of whipping cream add Old Bay seasoning as mentioned by a previous reviewer. I used medium shelled shrimp instead of cooked cocktail because they tend to turn tough and rubbery at the drop of a hat. Also use real crab why use fake other than to save money? Taking shortcuts on this will cause it to come out terrible as other people have stated. Served it over fettunci pasta instead of rice. For New Year's I will make the sauce beforehand and add it to the seafood at the last moment to reheat so I can get it on the table faster.",

I used montery jack cheese and added clam juice and clams to my sauce to make it taste more \"seafoody\". I also used canned crab. Some fish paste added to the sauce might make it taste more like seafood as well. I want to try that next time. Overall my family liked it and I would make it again with some small changes. I'll try cooking the rice with shrimp boullion cubes too.",
