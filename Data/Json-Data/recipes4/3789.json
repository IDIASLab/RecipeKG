I made it exactly as written, using all the 85% beef I had, and a little 93% beef. I found that it took a lot longer to brown all the meat - maybe 20 minutes on medium heat. Also, the recipe didn't say whether to drain the meat afterwards, so I decided not to. As for the \"chili powder to taste\", I used up what I had on hand, maybe 1.5T. It was seasoned, but hardly \"hot\" to my taste. All in all, this was worth making, especially for a carnivore.",
