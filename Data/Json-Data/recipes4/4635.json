The recipe for the meatloaf is better than what you usually see for this type of thing. The Cajun spice and sauteed vegetables are a great addition. I followed exactly as written but reduced amount of celery down to about 3/4 cup and used an equal amount of onion. I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture as well. For the \"bloody\" sauce I used 1/2 cup ketchup 1/4 cup barbecue sauce and 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard. I added a row of corn kernels to make his mouth. I thought a real steak knife was a much better touch than a plastic one. Happy Halloween!!!",
