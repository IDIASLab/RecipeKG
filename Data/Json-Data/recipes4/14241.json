The flavor combinations may sound unique, but they blend so well together.  Each flavor plays off the others making this salad a really well balanced, and healthy meal. I made it a few hours prior to serving so the ingredients could settle in together.  In addition I topped the salad with salted cashew nuts to add a little crunch and cut back on the olive oil to keep it lighter.",
