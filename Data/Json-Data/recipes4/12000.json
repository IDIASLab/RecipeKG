Though, before I cooked the meat, I diced two russet potatoes into very small pieces and cooked them with the onion, olive oil, and plenty of fresh crushed black pepper and garlic salt.  Once the potatoes were crispy and the onion tender, I stirred in the meat, and shortly after a whole link of chorizo.  I also added some hot chili powder and oregano.  If I really had wanted to follow grandma's recipe, I would have used finely chopped top sirloin instead of the frozen pre-ground variety.",

                "reviewBody": "Oh, my God! I'm Chilean. Empanadas, are among my favorite traditional food. Chilean empanadas are unique in texture and taste. This recipe is great! You can also substitute the meat filling (\"el pino\") for Mozarella cheese, poultry, or seafood.  When you use cheese, don't use any of the ingredients for the meat one, just the cheese!  Sparkle confectioner sugar on the top of the fried cheese empanada before serving.   This recipe should've been called \"Fried Meat Empanadas\" (Empanadas Fritas de Pino). \"Pino\" is what we call the mix of all the ingredients in the meat.  For all empanadas, slide ur clean, wet index finger on the edge of the dough before folding and cooking. This prevents the filling from dripping or falling out while fryng the empanada. Poke the top of the dough with a fork about 3 times before frying so air can exit and prevent dough for exploding while frying.  Look for the recipes for all of them and try them. You and ur family will just love them all! Your guests will love them, too. Make at least a dozen of them for a family of three or four. For parties, make sure you make at least 2 per guest.  Cook time is less than 5 minutes. Two or three minutes of deep fry should be enough.  IMPORTANT: Pls, don't use supermarket dough. The dough recipe is as important as the filling to taste the true Chilean empanadas. Add spices to the filling as per your taste. Don't substitute anything! Enjoy! :)",

I halved the dough for a pound of chicken and first of all I have to say that I was nervous about it being messy and sticky and difficult to handle - nope! It yielded 8 large empanadas and one small one with a lot less fuss than I thought (I rolled my circles out to be about 6 inches in diameter and they have to be THIN). Let me also say that it fries up flaky and perfect - just make sure your oil is hot before you slide these in. I tried these with chicken as follows: I sauteed half of a chopped onion in some olive oil and added a pound of cubed chicken breast. Added about 1 tsp. chili powder 3/4 tsp. salt 1 tsp. cumin powder 1 tsp. paprika 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper. I covered this and let it cook on medium heat stirring occasionally. When the chicken was cooked through I let it cool (omitted the raisins and vinegar) and added half a cup of chopped orange bell pepper and a tablespoon of chopped cilantro. Shredded the chicken into smaller pieces and divided into two portions; added habanero cheese to one and left the other as is. Used this to stuff the empanadas and they were fantastic! We liked both versions with and without the cheese. Good with sour cream or chimichurri sauce. Thanks for a great recipe and for taking away my apprehension about making these!",
