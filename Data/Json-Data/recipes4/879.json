In her version she adds a slice of dried beef (not Budding pressed beef-the stuff you want to look for is in the canned meat section by the tuna etc.)under each chicken breast. I have found 2 ways to improve her/this dish. #1 I precook the bacon and chop it up I cannot stand limp bacon! #2 Roughly chop the dried beef and mix in with the soup/sour cream mixture. While I agree with one reviewer who complained about the high calorie/fat content I also understand that we can't eat this every night. Save this for a special occasion and indulge once in a while.",
