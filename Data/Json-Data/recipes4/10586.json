I wasn't thrilled about adding lard to the whole batch so I pureed the beans as instructed and then just melted a bit of lard in a pan and refried a small portion. The rest I heated in a sauce pan. I don't think the lard added enough flavor to warrant the extra calories. With the plain rice this was pretty bland. I ended up stirring it all together adding salsa and making bean and cheese burritos. The kids loved those.",
