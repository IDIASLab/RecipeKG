I used several of the revisions posted by others including adding a can of cream of celery soup using the full pound of kielbasa adding carrots and an extra stalk of celery. I also used whole milk instead of the water and red potatoes (skin on) because they hold together the best and are less likely to dissolve into mush. I started by saut\u00e9ing the onions carrots and celery in a light drizzle of olive oil before adding the other ingredients. This is a keeper!",
