I figured I would keep going anyway and substituted cayenne for the paprika since some people thought it needed a bit of spice. I'm glad I did; it turned out terrific! I used bone-in chicken breasts. Normally I have trouble getting them to cook all the way through but these were perfect. The only problem I had was with the sauce. I reduced the recipe to 2 servings and I found there wasn't enough milk. It turned out fine though I just kept adding a little at a time until there were no lumps. Sorry I don't know how much I ended up adding. I will definitely make this again although next time I'll make sure I have some paprika.:)",
