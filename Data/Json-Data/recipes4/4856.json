I doubled all components of the rub except for the salt.  I kept it at the same measurement.   I heavily sprinkled the chicken breasts with the rub.   I also sauteed the mushrooms in a little butter until they were golden brown before adding to the crock pot.  This adds additional flavor.   I did not add the sour cream at first because I did not want it to curdle or clump.  I mixed the soup, chardonnay,  mushrooms and covered the chicken.  I cooked for 3 hours in the sauce.  I then removed the chicken breasts and whisked the sour cream into the sauce until fully incorporated.  I then added the chicken breasts back into the sauce and cooked for an additional hour.   Boneless chicken breasts definitely do not need 8 hours to cook or they will be dry.  The sauce was thick and very flavorful.  The chicken was moist and delicious.   I served with Jasmine rice and broccoli.  Very simple to make and tasty!   I'll definitely make again.",

The only thing I did differently was I didn't make it in the slow-cooker. I browned the chicken in a saucepan with some olive oil butter (just a bit of each) and garlic as well as the spices mentioned. Then I removed the chicken to a glass pan and put it in the oven at 350. Then I sauteed the mushrooms in the same pan (more garlic and a bit more butter) then added the liquids. I let this simmer on low for about 15-20 minutes while the chicken cooked in the oven. Then I transferred the sauce onto the chicken and let it cook another 25 minutes or so in the oven. I served it on a bed of rice with a side of roasted asparagus. YUM YUM YUM! The wine's definitely the key ingredient.",
