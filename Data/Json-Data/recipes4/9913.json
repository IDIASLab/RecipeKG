I used 2 15 oz cans of whole tomatoes, and cut up the tomatoes myself. I only added 1-1/3 cup of water along with the bullion, and used 3 TBS of the cornstarch.  I used about 1/3 tsp of ground ginger as we are not real crazy about this spice.  It sure made a lot, and it was really really good.  As others said, the next day it was even better with the melding of the flavors. The only thing is that next time, I will use a more tender cut of steak (vs the london broil which I used).  The meat was kind of tough.  But the flavor was excellent!!!!  Good find.",
