My burgs needed to cook for a bit longer than was recommended.  Served them on wheat buns with guac, lettuce, and salsa. I'll definitely make again.  These were totally Tex-Mex, so I might try to change ingredients and toppings to make different \"themed\" veggie burgs: Italian (basil, oregano, thyme, sundried tomatoes, grated parm), Asian (soy, ginger, broccoli), Mediterranean (chickpeas, olives, garlic, oregano, feta) etc.",

I read a lot of the reviews before I made these and noted that a lot of people said they did not hold together well. I did not want to add a lot more bread crumbs like many people had to do because that meant more calories and I am on a diet so this is what I came up with and it worked great. For starters I sauteed the peppers onions and mushrooms in a little olive oil then added them to the beans. Secondly I found that instead of putting everything in a food processor mash the beans by hand so you get a courser mix not mush. Lastly I formed them into patties and put them in the refrigerator for a few hours before cooking. The result was a veggie patty that held together great. I did cut down on the cumin and chili pepper as others suggested as well. All in all it is a great recipe!!",

I just reheated them in the oven at 425 for 6 min on each side. They we great! I didn't use the hot sauce but followed all the other ingredients exactly. You definitely need to top them off with lots of fresh veggies.( lettuce onion tom....ect)I will be making a huge batch to freeze for sports nights when I need to have a fast healthy meal. Thank you for the great recipe! To make the patties I lined a small container with saran wrap and then pushed the filling in and made them as big as I wanted. Then I just dropped them onto the pan. It works great.",
