I've found 1/2 tsp. almond flavoring is enough both in the 2nd layer & in the frosting.\nBe sure and mix the water, butter & flour well before adding the eggs in the second layer or you will have a gloppy mess. Also it's probably important to add the eggs one at a time and beat after each. I sometimes take shortcuts in recipes, but this is one you should follow pretty carefully.\nWhen I make these I divide the first dough into 2 parts and flatten on an ungreased cookie sheet to make 2 strips three inches wide and the length of the sheet. Then I spread the second layer evenly over each crust.  \nI also use skim milk in the frosting & it turns out great.",

I even cut the amount of extract in half for both the puff and the frosting. The pastry looked just gorgeous even though it fell a bit. I frosted it when the puff was cool and sprinkled it with toasted sliced almonds. However I was really unimpressed with the taste and texture of this. The puff sank and created a very strange flavorless custard-like center which was somewhat drippy and unappealing. The bottom layer was really yummy to me like a savory shortbread. It really didn't have a lot of flavor though but the texture was magnificent. Altogether this recipe is definitely not inedible but I wouldn't make it again.",

The middle layer needs more flavor and sweetness. It was very bland. The best part was the frosting. I think I might try this again but skip the bottom layer of crust because it really doesn't need it and it just crumbles and is dry and flavorless. I will add some sugar to the middle layer and more almond flavor. I couldn't taste any almond in the middle layer. Also I don't know if it just my oven but I don't usually have a problem and I bake A LOT....but I baked for 55 minutes and it looked done I stuck in a toothpick and it came out clean but it was NOT done in the middle. I tried to stick it back in but by the time I got it in it had already flattened out and it was too late. Don't trust the toothpick test. I think when it looks done keep it in another 10 minutes or something. I am going to try to find another recipe but if I can't find one then I'm going to try this again and alter it.",
