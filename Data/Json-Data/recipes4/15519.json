My line chef son, Stephen, and his girl friend came down from Big Bear for lunch with us and to collect his birthday cookies and fudge, that Mom has to make for his birthday each year. It didn't start to blizzard until after they left. By then, HWY 330 and 18 were a mess! Well, they made it home in 4 hours, but with their bellies full of your most excellent chili! I poached a large chicken breast, making a stock with with Better Than Bouillon, and then shredded the meat. I halved the recipe and still had a little left to send home with them. I served with salad toppings - shredded cabbage, sliced radishes, cilantro, sliced scallions, cheddar and pepper jack cheese, and baked tortilla strips. This was such a treat on a miserably snowy, cold day! Thank you, my friend, for a such a winning recipe!",

I made this recipe because the name had simple in it there is no added salt no cheese it called for low-sodium seasoning and the recipe submitter is not known to scrimp on flavour. My problem is I don't have access to canned green sauce or canned green chiles; so I improvised. I thought that not using the canned ingredients would have taken away flavour not so. I made my own green sauce and roasted my own green chiles then added the liquid from a jar of jalepenos. Man is this a good chili. Easy comes to mind as well as simple but tastes like one of those dishes that someone slaved over a hot stove for hours. I refuse to tell my family that it only took an hour. The house filled with an aroma that sent all the family in the kitchen for a taste. Simple delicious easy low sodium rich flavour and filling. What more could you want? Thanks bd.weld for your great recipe.",

I am also a big fan of green chilies so I knew with a quick glance of the ingredients that this was going to be a darn good chili. It seems a lot of people translate green chilies and green enchilada sauce into \"too hot\" but that really isn't the case in this recipe. Made as written this recipe was super simple packed full of flavor fuss free and perfect for days you don't have much time to spend in the kitchen. Bonus is that it is friendly enough for the entire family yet more heat can easily be added to the individual bowl of anyone desiring more spiciness. Thanks for the great recipe bd.weld!",
