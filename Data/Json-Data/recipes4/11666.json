Next time, I'll try omitting the extra salt and butter.  We steamed for a tad bit too long so the stems were slimy, but the tops were just delicious!  That was purely our own fault, and not the fault of the recipe - I'm just including it here as a warning to other members - please be careful about cooking too long!  It's really a great, simple, healthy recipe, and I think it deserves more attention.  :-)",

This recipe was a great base, though I agree with other reviewers that adding the salt and butter to the steaming water is just a waste.\n\nI made this as a snack so I could try steaming asparagus. (:\nI knew I wanted more of a kick of flavor rather than just plain steamed asparagus, so I saut\u00e9ed about a teaspoon or two of minced garlic (I love garlic so I pretty much just put a dollop of it in) and a pinch of salt in about 3-4 tablespoons of butter in a separate pan. ((Be careful to not brown the garlic however, as it gets bitter.))\nI drizzled this onto my steamed asparagus, but still wasn't satisfied with the amount of flavor, so I followed Josie's advice and put the juice of half of a lime on there. It was absolutely delicious! I will definitely make this again, though I might try saut\u00e9ing the asparagus in the butter mixture after steaming, and maybe adding some more spices. (:",
