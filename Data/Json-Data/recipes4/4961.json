As the recipe suggests, I used minced garlic to taste, probably a third of what was called for, and only enough chicken broth necessary to allow the bok choy to steam.  I poured enough broth into my large skillet to a depth of about 1/2 inch. Otherwise a great, basic reference recipe for cooking whole baby bok choy, one I know I'll come back to.",

But 2 cans of chicken broth is \"too much\" for 6 heads of baby bok choy so I used an eyeball amount probably 3/4 cup filled up to the sides of the bok choy. Also I did not add the entire 1/4 cup of minced garlic only enough to suit my tastes. I lightly seasoned with hawaiian salt fresh ground black pepper and fresh squeezed lemon right before serving. Delicious! The fresh lemon really adds a lovely zip to the baby bok choy without taking away from the broth garlic and butter. I 'd prepare this side dish again the same exact way with other types of main or asian themed dishes. Tonight I served this along with \"Adobo Chicken with Ginger \" and \"Roasted Corn with Garlic Rice \" all from this website.",
