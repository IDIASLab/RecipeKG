I only have to cook them for about 5 hours though, which i'm blaming the altitude we live in.\n I followed the directions and the ribs came out perfect. The \"Sea Salt\" wasn't specified to being fine, medium, or coarse.  I only had fine sea salt, and the ribs were a tinge on the salty side. But I think next time I will go with Coarse.\nThanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! The ribs came out extremely tender & tasty",

Hubby has mentioned this dish several times since I made it and wants it to be a regular because of the versatility with the finished meat.  I used a boneless chuck style rib as that was what we had on hand and they were delicious.\n\nI made a full pan so we were able to eat them several ways.  Plain out of the pan with au gratin potatoes and salad.  Leftover reheated brushed with barbeque sauce and mac-n-cheese on the side.  A third lunch meal of toasted sourdough bread sandwiches with the meat shredded topped with muenster cheese along with pan drippings/broth for dipping.  \n \nWill keep using this low slow cooking method for tenderness and flavor!",
