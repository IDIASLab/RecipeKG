I beat the eggs really well first then added the rest of the ingredients and beat in my stand mixer for about 1 minute on medium high. It's rather a dry cake - I think it needs a an icing drizzle of some kind. Some cakes get more moist after sitting overnight and if this one does I will add to this review but right now it needs a cup of tea or coffee to go with it.",
