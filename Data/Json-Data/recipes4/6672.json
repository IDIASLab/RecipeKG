Instead of a yellow pepper I used a comination of purple green and red peppers. I also cut up about a 1/4 of a fresh cayenne pepper. I also used red onion not your typical white or yellow. I used regular cream cheese..not a big fan of the reduced calorie one. As far as seasonings...this is where I ventured out. I seasoned the salmon with salt and pepper garlic Old Bay and dried dill. I let the salmon \"marinade\" it the seasonings for about a hour before cooking. We will definitely enjoy this recipe again on \"leftover\" night. BTW: my husband said \"Why go out to dinner when I can get restaurant meals at home.\" So I'd say he liked it too.",
