It's better not to cook the shredded carrot and apple as long as the kale, or the kale as long as your peppers.  It makes for good textures all around.\n\nI changed the recipe a little bit.  Instead of olive oil and balsamic, I used sesame oil and apple cider vinegar.  For my taste, I cooked the kale a few minutes.  Also, after I finished cooking I sprinkled the recipe with chopped almonds.  \n\nThis recipe is ripe for experimentation with the seasoning.  I imagine ginger or turmeric would particularly accompany the garlic well.",

I was a bit puzzled by the name, but the many colors do sort of remind me of \"cowboy caviar\".  Using kale, instead of beans and corn, tames the calorie punch.  The sweetness provided by the apple and carrot are surprising additions, but with the balsamic, they work.  This recipe involves a lot of preparation, and since I had some leftover, I hope it will be good tomorrow, too.  Thanks for the idea!",
