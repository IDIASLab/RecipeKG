Before I served it I decided to double up on the broccoli but that still wasn't enough to give it any kind of body. I felt the cream of chicken soup added nothing to this recipe and definitely wouldn't use that again. If I was to make again I'd double up on the carrots broccoli and tortellini for sure. An extra cup or two of chicken wouldn't hurt either. I would also probably cut back the water to 2 cups or less. Pepper would be a nice addition but I'm ok with leaving it out and letting the individuals decide on how much they want at the table. As written we had to salt our bowls because this was very watery. That was disappointing especially when you look at the sodium levels already in this dish. This soup does have elements of greatness but I feel the proportions are way off.",

Add corn and heat. Stir in spices including some chili powder and garlic and cook about 1 min then stir in chicken Add chicken broth broccoli soup and water and bring to a boil. Add frozen tortellini and stir. Reduce heat to simmer. After about 20 mins add broccoli to the soup and simmer another 10 mins or so. If the tortellini is soaking up too much liquid add some more chicken broth and maybe some more water. Really filling and tastes great with baked garlic bread. The tortellini will soak up the liquid so will likely add some additional broth when we heat leftovers tomor",
