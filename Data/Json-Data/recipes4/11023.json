In addition to the onion, I added about 1/2 of a green pepper. While browning the meat & veg, I threw in 2tsp minced garlic plus 1 beef bullion cube. Rather than use tomatoes w/green chiles & 1c. water, I used (2) 8oz cans of tomato sauce. Great recipe.  I had to improvise based on what I had, but I will continue to make it with these changes as it turned out to be pretty close to my fathers without all of the work.  Thanks for the recipe.  Something this easy, quick, and cheap shouldn't taste this good!",
