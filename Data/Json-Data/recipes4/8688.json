This isn't how I typically make sausage and peppers but I couldn't resist trying this with such a cute and catchy name and I got a kick out of how you came up with the recipe!  I used rigatoni rather than spaghetti because I didn't remove the sausage from the casings, so I needed a sturdier pasta.  I just cut the links into manageable sections.  I added a little red wine and used fresh herbs rather than dried.  At  the end, I couldn't resist throwing in some chopped, fresh San Marzano tomatoes from my garden.  Hubs said he likes the way I usually make sausage and peppers better, but when I reminded him that the whole point was to try something different, he agreed this was very good in its own right! I admit my own Italian bias, but beyond that I have to say you can't go wrong with this recipe - it's delicious!",

I did make some changes (2-3 cloves of garlic instead of 1 added a can of drained italian-style diced tomatoes a splash of red wine 1 chopped small onion multi-grain penne instead of spaghetti and extra sausage cut into bite-sized pieces) but I don't think any of these changed the character of the dish too much. It was tasty and filling and while he ate hubby picked up an Italian accent as he told me about movie references to food in The Godfather. I guess that means it was a success - I'll make it again.",
