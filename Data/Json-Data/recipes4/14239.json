I love the flavors and the different textures of this dish. If you don't like fish you'd still like this. It is not \"fishy\". If you don't like raisins you won't know they are there. They give a hint of sweetness to every bite. The capers and olives a hint of tanginess and a bit of saltiness just enough to make it wonderful. You can serve this with a side of white rice or with some boiled roots (like yuca malanga yautia...etc) OR just do like I am doing right now...eat a bowl of it by itself before it dissapears.

The term 'salted cod' has become a generic term for salted white fish. Pollock is less expensive comes in convenient boned filets and works fine for this recipe. The flavor is less intense but this might be a positive for those who didn't like salted cod because of that.",
