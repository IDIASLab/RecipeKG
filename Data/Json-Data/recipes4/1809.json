My favorite bites were those with chicken and noodles. Egg noodles weren't necessary. Use any noodle on hand. I will also thicken the sauce a little next time. Overall a very enjoyable meal and I will definitely make this again.",

I cut the raw chicken into bite sized pieces before tossing in flour and deep fried it until light brown. Everything else I did the same except I fried the chives in the sauce for a few minutes at the end. This was devoured!",
