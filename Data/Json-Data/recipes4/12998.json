I cooked mine on my bread board and found that 8 minutes was perfect. The ones I cooked for 10 minutes were a little overdone. This is a great basic naan recipe to start with for stuffed naan. Can't wait to try it with garlic. This will be a favorite in my house. Thank you for sharing.",

The only issue i had was with the flaked coconut - couldn't taste it at all it's a delicate taste which was lost in the sharpness of the rest of the spices.
