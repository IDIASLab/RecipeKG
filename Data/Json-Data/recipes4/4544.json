But it is still an awful lot of butter and heavy cream for 4 pieces of chicken. But I did have thin sliced chicken breasts. I am not sure what the whipping of the cream did either versus just pouring it directly on the chicken. I would have to experiment with this to see what I could add. But because of the high calories and fat added to a simple chicken breast I think I would have to think of way to modify that aspect also in order to make again.",
