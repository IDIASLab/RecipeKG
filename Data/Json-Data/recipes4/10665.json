I used turkey bacon in case that makes a difference to anyone and baked my bacon in the oven instead of pan frying it to save myself a bit of mess. After making it I popped it in the fridge overnight to reheat it for the party. But it reheats really well and tasted fabulous with the bread we served it with. I will most definitely be making this again!",

I only rated 4 instead of 5 because I think the reciepe should call for the broccoli to be diced into small piece it ended up being more like broccoli with melted cheese ontop. So next time to make it more \"dip like\" Ill probably use a food processor for the bacon and broccoli or something of that sort. But the taste of this recipe was WONDERFUL!! I dont have any left overs! Also this goes great in a bread bowl",

It is really thin so I agree with the suggestion to let cool and reheat then the consistency is perfect.  If you used less cheese it would be more like a side dish, I think next time I will cut up the broccoli into smaller pieces to make it easier for dipping.  All in all it is decent, though I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up on this recipe.  I'll have to experiment more next time.",
