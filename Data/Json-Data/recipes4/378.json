I set the roast on a bed of cremini mushrooms, used beefy onion soup mix, since that's what I had in the pantry, only 2 T. of soy sauce to avoid this being too salty, a bay leaf, and just a mere cup of water. The house smelled wonderful and the roast was delicious and flavorful with a rich au jus. We're looking forward to having the leftovers as French Dip sandwiches!  ",

What \"made\" the roast was the juice it simmers in and it makes the absolute BEST gravy for hot roast beef sandwiches the next day. I used about 4 large tbsp. of corn strach mixed with water to give the juice it's gravy consistency before serving. You can't find better tasting rost beef gravy than this at any restaurant!!  I will make this time and time again.  Very impressive.  Who would know it is SOOOO easy?",
