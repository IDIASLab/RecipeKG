                "reviewBody": "Ohmigosh, my family LOVED this!  I doubled the recipe and used sausage and ground beef. I like to brown the meat in a separate pan on the stove so that I can drain the meat in a colander before I put it in the pressure cooker (I want my family to eat less grease.) I have one of those 10 qt Power Pressure Cookers from the infomercials. I put all the incredients except the cheeses into the pressure cooker and I used chicken broth (it's what I had in the pantry) to make sure the dry pasta was covered with liquid and stirred it all together.  Then I set the cooker for 8 minutes on the \"Risotto Setting\" and made sure to release the valve and not let it sit on \"keep warm\" to long so that the pasta didn't get soggy.  I stirred in the cheeses, which melted right away, and served.  This will be a family favorite for sure.\n\nUpdate 10/24/2016:\nOk, I noticed all the reviews that said this recipe was bland and my family actually laughed out loud when I told them that, so I set out to find out what I was doing differently here other than the sausage.  I realized that instead of using boring old \"Stewed Tomatoes\" I use a can of Rotel brand diced tomatoes in this recipe.  I think it really punches up the flavor, especially against the ricotta cheese.  Hopefully that helps some of y'all that are looking for something more interesting, because this is a super easy meal and I love making it on weekdays.  It's also great for leftovers.",

I was thrilled!\n\nWe found it very tasty. I used ground moose meat because that's what we have in the freezer, and I actually used 2lbs of meat as I had to feed 7 for dinner. The onion I used was also very large. I had a larger can of tomato sauce than what was called for, but since you had to cover with water anyway, I just threw the whole thing in there as part of the liquid. Also, I very often put more garlic in a recipe than what is stated, and this was no exception - I think I used 4 or 5 cloves (it was a bit older, so it needed some help. ;)\n\nIt cooked up to perfection in my 6 qt Instant Pot set manually to high pressure and 7 minutes (since the meat was doubled). I wish I could say that 7 minutes is the magic number, but my pot didn't seal the first time and I threw it on again for another 5 minutes. I basically stirred in the ricotta cheese and served - we all put our own bit of grated mozza cheese on top. So delicious! We are all looking forward to having this again sometime soon!",

I  didn't find it bland, but then I also added all my seasoning to the meat as I browned it, and I used more than called for. I saw one reviewer used Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  Since the meat cooked down so much the first time, the second time I used double the amount, equal part beef and sausage. I also used tomato paste instead of stewed tomatos, just because I never liked chunks of tomato in my sauce, this is probably why I didn't find it thin as some others said. I have since made it several times, sometimes with the spinach and sometimes without. (Some in my family don't like spinach) When leaving  out the spinach, I had to cut back on salt, it seems the spinach needs it more than the rest of the dish. Once I even used frozen broccoli florets instead of the spinach, worked great and tasted really good. Now that I have mastered my pressure cooker, time to find more recipes!",

For sauce I used some homemade spaghetti sauce (30 ounces) that I added a can of tomato paste to. I upped the seasonings - probably tripled and added some crushed red pepper. Instead of frozen spinach I used about four or five ounces of fresh. I used a box of whole grain pasta which took longer to cook. As others suggested I used broth instead of water. It was probably about 3 1/2 cups of water. After pressure cooking I added cottage cheese as that is what I had on hand. I was concerned about the amount of water remaining but realized that the pasta would soak it up as it finished cooking. I stirred in probably two cups of mozzarella just before serving.",
