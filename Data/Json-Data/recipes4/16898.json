I just used whatever veggies I had in the fridge for the stir fry part. \n\nDo NOT mix the spaghetti squash into the overall mixture. It will get super gummy and turn into mush. Just layer some spaghetti squash down on your plate and then ladle the sauce/veggie/meat mixture on top. \n\nThis made way closer to 6 servings for me.

Being Asian,  my husband and I are usually hesitant on trying 'Asian' recipes due to many failures in the past,  but this recipe was actually delicious. My picky husband loved the sauce and requested that I make more so he can put it on everything from noodles to chicken.  I agree with other reviewers that the sauce needed a little bit of sugar, so after tasting the sauce from the original recipe,  I added approx 1 Tbsp of brown sugar and it perfectly balanced out all the flavours.  Will definitely make it again.",

I do think this is a good start. I do love the idea of using this with spaghetti squash for those who may be gluten intolerant or low carbing it. In my oven I cook my squash at 375 for about 45 minutes to an hour for a crisp tender texture. All ovens are different. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",
