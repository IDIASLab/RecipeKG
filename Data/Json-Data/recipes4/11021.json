I served some over fritos others without added shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream to cut the heat then sprinkled some black olives on top for my son. This fast easy dish was a hit in my house and we will make it again. thanks!",

We had it over tricolor rotini with a dollop of sour cream. I give this four stars because it was quick easy and healthy. It wasn't out of this world amazing but good enough to make a couple times a year. Thanks!",
