                "reviewBody": "This recipe looked good when I read it--was looking for something a bit friendly to our low carb efforts, in casserole form. I submit recipes and don't like it when somebody makes a bunch of changes and then rates it, but let me be clear that I think this would have been a five-star keeper without my messing with it. However, let me share what I did: First, I used a bag of shredded cabbage coleslaw mix because I hate grating cabbage. One bag was perfect. Next, I did the same stuff I read in the other reviews: some Italian seasoning, sprinkle of cayenne. I used 1(15oz)can tomato sauce PLUS 1 can condensed tomato soup (healthy req), because we like that slight sweetness and depth of flavor in anything like stuffed peppers, etc. Here's the tricky part for those who lamented uncrispy bacon. I left it off while baking. Cut the bacon into small cubes and fried them crisp separately in a skillet. DRAINED well on paper towels while casserole baked. Baked in foil-covered casserole as stated, removed from oven when done, sprinkled with the smattering of crispy bacon pieces and a little shredded cheddar/colby-jack cheese. Back in oven for 5 minutes till melted cheese. IT. WAS. AWESOME. Probably the best recipe I've seen in a long time. Served with fresh broccoli steamed for 5 minutes (while cheese was melting)in a little chicken bouillon & 1tsp. butter; desert was the juiciest, fresh ripe pear you can imagine. What a great supper--thanks so much for giving us this great recipe !",

I grew up on the Hungarian version of \"stuffed cabbage\".\nThere are a few cooking basics I felt were missing.\nFirst,  I softened the onion (sweet) and garlic after browning the meat. (I used ground sirloin). Also, I would have cooked the meat in the bacon FAT for depth of smoked flavor.  Bacon does not \"crisp\" while covered in foil.  (This is NOT a low fat, low carb, Blah, blah, blah, recipe. Search elsewhere).  The addition of a can of drained sauerkraut would have knocked this recipe out of the park.   And where is the paprika?  Next time, I would use a spicy V-8 like juice instead of tomato sauce, as the tomato sauce was a little too Italian-y for this dish ( not that there's anything wrong with that, as I am 1/2 Italian also).  There is potential here.  Thanks for the inspiration.",
