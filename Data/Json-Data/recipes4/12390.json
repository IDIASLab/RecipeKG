Cut back 1/2 on the red pepper since my husband doesn't like too much \"hot\" and added 1/2 lb of scallops as well.  Didn't have fresh cilantro so used dried in moderation.  I used a good quality rather dry white wine as the sherry adds enough sweetness.  Thanks",

You either Hate it or you Love it.  Very rarely is there an indifferent.  I just happen to know the one man in Washington state who stands in that middle.  LOL.  Anyway.  I am going to go and make my own fish stew recipe right now.  I will post it when I am satisfied with it, and I am certain that there will be people who think there is too much of this, not enough of that, and what the heck were you thinking making this waste of food product....

I added some extra seafood: shrimp, crab legs, shelled clams as well as canned clams, octopus (my husband likes it), extran white fish as well, and an extra can of stewed tomatoes. I also added a little more water to make it more soupy and simmered uncovered on very low flame to ensure that the liquid stayed more soupy and not stewy. I added the seafood and cilantro after the hour simmering for about 10-12 minutes. It turned out great and I served it with crusty french bread and lemon wedges on the side. My husband said he wants this for his birthday now!! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks \"Dlish\"...is was Delish!!",
