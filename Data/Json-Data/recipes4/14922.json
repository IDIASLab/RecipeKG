I changed up some of the ingredients (picky eaters at my house) so here goes: I used a yellow cake mix applesauce instead of oil unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of water and added white chocolate chips and m&ms. I also omitted the coconut and peanut butter. I made a simple cream cheese frosting. The picky eater LOVED them.",
