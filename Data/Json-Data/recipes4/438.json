Omit the green onions and throw some minced garlic freshly ground black pepper and diced onion in with the ground beef. Stir the cheese mixture into the cooked noodles and place in the bottom of the baking dish. Top with the sauce. Cover and bake for 20 minutes uncover and top with the cheese. Bake for about 10 minutes more or until the cheese is bubbly. This makes a ton of seriously yummy comfort food. Everyone loves it!",

I buttered the spaghetti a bit before layering in the pan and I used a jar of Newman's Sausage and Peppers sauce along with 1/2 a jar of Ragu-  it could have used more sauce so I would use two whole jars next time.  I also combined some ricotta cheese with the cream cheese mixture.  We all loved it!  I might skip the cheddar cheese next time and replace it with mozzerella.  You could also scale down the pasta a bit if you don't have a full pound and it would work fine...the pound of spaghetti really filled the pyrex.  This will be something I make at least once a month-  it makes a ton and I always appreciate left overs so I don't have to cook every day.  Thanks for sharing a great pasta dish.",

I omitted both the green peppers and green onions and used Bertolli Organic Tomato Basil Sauce--YUM O! I saut\u00e9ed half a sweet onion in butter until translucent in the same pan browned up quality lean ground beef seasoned to taste. Tossed thin spaghetti noodles w/ butter and parmesan cheese as suggested by Khristin (no dry noodles like others). Added 1/2 cup of low-fat ricotta cheese and substituted a combo of cheddar/jack and mozzarella for the cheddar cheese. After dinner I couldn t stop eating little bites from the casserole dish. Will be making this again soon! Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!",

But as usual I used it as a skeleton and changed the following...\n1. I didn't measure out the sour cream and cream cheese exactly. I just blended a medium container of SC and 8 oz of CC. Much easier! \n2. I used the 1 lb of spaghettie and added some broken pieces of lassagna I had.\n3. I used 1 lb ground chuck AND 1 lb. roll of sage flavored sausage. I fried it together throwing in the green pepper and 4 cloves of garlic. I also used lots of spices to heat it up like cumin, oregano, garlic salt, seasoned pepper, pepper corn ? (like used at pizza hut to sprinkle on) and minced onion.\n4. I bought 8 oz mozzarella and 8 oz sharp chedder and used all but 2 oz from each. \nIt was delicious!! Since I baked it in a 14x11 pan, there were leftovers of the noodles and meatsauce. There was no extra sour adn cream cheese. I added the noodles to the sauce and froze for spaghetti later. I bagged and froze the leftover pie too.",

I omitted the green pepper (personal preference) reduced the spaghetti to approx. 3/4 lb and increased sauce by about another 1/4 jar. I like very saucy noodles and found that ratio to be perfect. I loved the sour cream and cream cheese. In the future I may take a few short cuts and use prepared meat sauce (rather than browning meat and simmering) and chive cream cheese (rather than cutting green onions).
