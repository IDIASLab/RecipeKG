The peanut butter mix was difficult to spread on the delicate crepes; I was concerned they would tear it really needs to be thinner! The combination of the rich chocolate and the fat in the cream seemed to make the sauce extremely sweet; maybe a few drizzles would have been more appropriate than trying to cover the crepe!",
