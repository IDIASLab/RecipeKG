I thawed it out for half a minute in the microwave and then prebaked it for 10 minutes while I browned the groundbeef. I added about 3/4 cup frozen chopped onion to the beef while it was browning and while that was going on I made Betty Crocker packaged mashed potatoes in the microwave which only take 4 minutes. When the beef and onion was done I drained out the fat and added the rest of the ingredients right in the frypan instead of dirtying another bowl. I doubled the worcestershire and ketchup amounts which worked out fine and gave it a really nice taste. Then I baked it only about 20 minutes since I had already prebaked the crust. Yum. Everyone really liked it my husband wanted to know what I added to the beef! Next time I'll make two since there wasn't any left for anyone to take to work today! Thanks so much. This is going to be a regular at our house.",

It is a recipe that has been added as a regular to our menu planning. \r\n\r\nI made just a couple changes. I cut the recipe in half except for the corn and Worcestershire sauce (I used all it called for), and I upped the ketchup. I used a deep dish pie crust and the half recipe filled it perfectly. \r\n\r\nOne thing that I think I will change the next time I make it is that instead of putting the corn on the bottom I'll put the meat mixture on bottom with the corn between the meat and potatoes. When I cut into it to serve the corn just went everywhere. I figured the potatoes would make them \"stick\" in the pie a little better. \r\n\r\nRegardless of the minor changes I made, this is a very yummy and hearty meal!",

I blended the cheese into the potatoes rather than having them lay on the top sprinkling a touch of paprika to the top to give it some color. I sauteed some mushrooms with the beef too. A pre-baked crust worked really well and I didn't want the juice of the corn sogging the crust so I followed the advice of the other reviewers and put my corn on top of the beef - although I don't know why you couldn't just mix it in as well. It was a nice hearty winter meal that my meat and potatoes family really enjoyed. I served it with the recipe for Sweet Dinner Rolls and it was a hit!",
