(and less oven leakage of cheese). with these adjustments it is a winning recipe. also put the stuffed prepared peppers into the fridge for an hour before breading this also cuts down on leakage because they are firmer. some folks say they arent spicy enoug: this depends on your peppers. some jalapenos are hotten than others just liek some aples are sweeter than others. if you notice you have a bland batch of ppers when you are sedding them (and belive me you'll KNOW if you have a spicy batch from the coughing you'll do) save soem of the seeds or add even more tobasco.",

We also used the bread crumb mix instead of corn flakes. We ended up freezing them on the cookie sheet after they were cooled, then placed in a freezer bag for future use!",

I added some mozzarella to the mix and dredged the peppers in flour mixed with cayenne, paprika, thyme, and garlic powder before re-dipping them in the egg, and then Italian breadcrumbs (which I used in lieu of the corn flakes).  I baked them in a muffin tin, 3 to a cup, and that helped hold them together and keep the cheese in.  Halfway through baking I sprayed them with Pam which helped to brown.  They were very comparable to the deep fried version and I had to keep myself from eating the whole batch!  They are VERY messy and TIME CONSUMING to make, however, so they will not be a regular, but as a special treat they are nice...",

I chose this recipe based on the baking method rather then fried. I followed this recipe to the \"T\" and found it easy to pipe in the filling (using the ol' corner of baggie method) and gently rolling the peppers in milk/egg then cornflake crumbs. Not hard at all milk egg mixture really stuck to pepper and cornflake crumbs a perfect combination. Was delicious! Family ate all (and had quite few from garden). I really like the baked part honestly didn't miss the \"fried\" mess that usually comes with frying. Really worth a very small effort!",

I did a trial run the night before making these and I wasn't to thrilled with the way that they baked the filling kinda ran out all over the baking sheet. Sooo I decided to chop off the stems of the peppers & slit them lengthwise (without cutting them in half). I scraped the seeds out and then stuffed them with the mixture (which I suggest cutting in 1/2 or doubling the peppers because I have 1/2 of it left). I ran out of time so I skipped the breading part & microwave \"steamed\" them I have to say they looked much better than the oven trial and they were gone quick I didn't even get to try one!
