This recipe comes close, with a few additions. I think this recipe as written makes a great solid base, but the flavor is too bland. I sub chicken stock for the chicken broth (a subtle difference, just my preference), and leave out the mushrooms (since my kids don\u2019t like them), but leave everything else. Then I add the following: 1 diced onion, 1 cup chopped celery, cracked black pepper (to taste), and 1 cup slivered (not sliced) almonds. I add all of that to the sauce when adding the cooked chicken, green pepper, and pimientos. Mix well & cook til the chicken is heated through. After incorporating the rice, I also add 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese and mix well. Very thick and spreads easily into a buttered, 2 1/2 qt. casserole dish. This is a favorite at our house and provides plenty of leftovers.",
