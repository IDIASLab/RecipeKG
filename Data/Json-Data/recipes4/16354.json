The only changes I made were to use coconut oil instead of olive oil (I find the olive oil flavor too strong for cakes) and I used vanilla extract instead of coffee extract.  This rose beautifully and I enjoyed the light texture.  Also, unlike the other mug cake I make, this one pulled away from the sides nicely and could have easily been turned onto a plate. No sticking!  And no time for a pic either! Thanks for sharing your recipe DenaMarie!",

I used extra dark chips so it wasn't sweet at all, but gave a wonderful cake mouth feel  that I was craving on my LCHF diet.    Made this a second time, this time subbing applesauce for the oil, adding 1tsp vanilla extract and 1tsp agave syrup to sweeten.  Cake rose higher, and was fluffier in texture.  Just as satisfying as first attempt, and less calories too.  Both cakes pulled away from the sides and easily turned out of mug.",

I'd recommend not melting the chocolate chips completely so you still get those little hits of chocolate in the cake. The 1 1/2 min. cooking time was spot on. You'll likely want whipped cream on it if you have it, but it's very nice on its own, and the texture was surprisingly light. Will definitely make again.",
