On top of the first and second layers, put half of the cheese/veggie mixture. On top of the third layer (the top layer) put your last two cups of sauce. I actually used three cups of sauce for the top and sprinkled the top with extra mozzeralla and parmesan. Other adjustments I made: less onion, added garlic, added mushrooms, used fresh broccoli, and LESS oil. There is no way you need a half cup of oil. That really ups the fat content of this recipe. I sprayed the pan with PAM and used one tablespoon of oil. I sauteed on medium and it worked great.",

Namely, we used 1/2 of a 16 oz box of noodles which is 9 noodles.  Also 1 lb of ricotta cheese and 2 eggs was plenty of filling for a 9x13 pan.  I agree with another view on sauteeing the veggies in much less oil, abt 1 T is plenty!  Will definitely make this (adjusted!) recipe again  :-)",

I lightly coated the bottom of a large skillet with olive oil browned some garlic in the oil and then sauteed all of the vegetables in it. You do not need all of the olive oil that this recipe calls for and it is much healthier this way. The garlic added a nice flavor to the vegetables. I also used fat free ricotta and mozzarella to make this recipe a little bit healthier. The taste was not compromised at all. I used no boil lasagna noodles to make this recipe easier and I only needed one box to make a huge pan. This is a great recipe but like others have said be careful with the directions.",

I used nine noodles (rice lasagna - no boil!), one container of ricotta, 2 eggs.  I sauteed yellow onion and then added carrots and asparagus, then broccoli, red bell pepper and cauliflower.  I only used about a tablespoon of olive oil and some garlic - and also only used fresh veggies.  I can't do frozen veggies.  I cooked it for an hour on 350 with tightly wrapped foil and then uncovered and put it under the broiler to finish.  We enjoyed it for a Sunday dinner and are both looking forward to the leftovers.  One other modification: I put a little tomato sauce on the bottom of the pan before the first layer of pasta.  Then I did: cheese/veggie mix, shredded cheese, dollops of sauce, pasta until the top layer where I only did sauce.  I was easy on the cheese between layers.",
