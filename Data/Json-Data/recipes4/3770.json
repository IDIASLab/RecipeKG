                "reviewBody": "I've made this twice and discovered two very important parts of the recipe that you can *not* overlook:  1) Use fresh strawberries or your own frozen. Commercially frozen doesn't interact as well with the Jello for some reason. 2) MASH the strawberries.  The juice has to be released or there's nothing to break down the gelatin and you get a very unpleasant texture on the top of your cake.  If your strawberries aren't very juicy, sprinkle a little sugar on them before mashing and let them set for an hour or so - the juice will come out.  The cake by itself is pretty, but it does need whipped cream or ice cream (heat the cake up slightly) to finish it off for eating.",

It's moist and delicious. The jello trickling throughout the cake was awesome. I'm totally in love with this recipe. It's incredibly simple too! I made a few changes ONLY and only because I really wanted to try this and didn't have exactly what you called for. I replaced your strawberries with frozen (thawed) strawberry slices I had on hand. I also didn't have strawberry jello, I used what I did have; Raspberry. I love how this cake has marshmallows in it. I wasn't sure how that was going to turn out but as it is, it adds crunch when you're not expecting it. Sooooo yummy. This cake was again, super easy to make and loads of fun. Each step from placing the strawberries to pouring the cake batter was neat. I smiled the whole time in excitement to try this cake. I just had the first piece and I give you 5 stars.  :) Thank you for sharing this with the world. ",

I used a non stick baking pan and made sure to let it cool for twenty minutes before turning over on to a serving dish. I served slightly warm with French Vanilla ice cream and today my boyfriend and his sister requested it for dessert and once again it was great! Thank You for the great and easy recipe!",
