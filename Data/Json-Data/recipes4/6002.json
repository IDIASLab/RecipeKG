I did butterfly the breast (probably could have pounded them too). They were absolutely delicious. I may add some heat (cayenne, crushed red pepper) to suit my taste next time but this recipe is FINE as is, needs nothing,  really great.",

My star rating is based on the recipe as written (minus one star just cause it's pretty high in sodium). My daughter requested it last night and I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I made some substitutions and it worked out well-- we had a lemon essenced sparkling water so I used that and added the juice of 2 lemons and about 1-2 tbsn brown sugar to imitate the lemon-lime soda. I also used diced garlic instead of powdered and about 1/3 the amount of soy sauce and subbed some liquid aminos still using less than the amount called for by about half. (Coconut aminos would be an even better option but I have yet to get my hands on any). We only had about 25 minutes to marinate it but it still came out moist and flavorful with that familiar flavor that I'm used to when it's made as written. Just wanted to share this with others in case they avoid soda like our family does.",
