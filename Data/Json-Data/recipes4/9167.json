I have a question though...was there supposed to be some Taco Seasoning of some sort in the recipe and maybe it was mistakenly omitted? I got all my ingredients out to make and realized I must have left the cauliflower at the store but because I had 2 pounds of beef and I figured the cauliflower was just going to be 'filler ' I thought I could continue without. I had just finished my 48 hour chicken bone broth so after I finished browning the beef onions and diced chiles (store didn't have jalapenos in a can) I added just one cup of broth and the cream cheese then the tomatoes salt and pepper. So my end result was kind of like a creamy beefy goulash! It is so good that I wrote down everything I did exactly and will definitely make again the same way although at some point I may try fresh Jalapeno peppers - see if that kicks it into Taco tasting mode.",

This is a genius way to hide cauliflower - you couldn't even tell it was there! I would recommended covering the cauliflower with a lid while it's cooking, to prevent evaporation, otherwise it is a little difficult blending the cauliflower in the blender.  I used fire-roasted diced tomatoes for added flavor. This makes a very thick soup, so if you prefer yours a little thicker, add a bit more broth at the end. I thought it was perfect as is.  You could get away with only dirtying one pot. I would definitely make this again! It reheats well too.",
