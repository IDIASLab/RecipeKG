Potatoes were very dry on top and completely mushy under the lamb. Top cover potatoes weren't covered by the broth and I didn't add any so they dried out. I think they were supposed to be covered. Lamb was better the next day after sitting overnight in the fridge. Recommended changes: Add a tablespoon of sage. Add some carrots. Completely drain the lamb and onions of all the oil. Add more salt on the potatoes. Maybe add mushrooms for those who like them.",
