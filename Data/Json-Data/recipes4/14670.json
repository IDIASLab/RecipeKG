A nice crusty bread to mop up the liquid makes it all just perfect!",

I used one whole bag of baby carrots instead of one carrot that the recipe called for omitted the white wine since I didn't have any and used Herbes de Provence from a jar (about a teaspoon) instead of the fresh herbs. I put the flour directly into the stew (instead of mixing with water first) and it came out perfect. I served this over whole grain Texmati rice. I will definitely be making this again.",
