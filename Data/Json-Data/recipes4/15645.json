Pasta has too many carbs for me these days, and this recipe is a delicious, less carb alternative. I used almond milk because it has fewer carbs than milk, and, after reading the other reviews, I opted to add 1/4 teaspoon of smoked paprika, and it tasted just right. I might add more tomato and less cheese the next go around, just to see. Also, like most mac and cheese recipes, this one would probably be good with some chopped broccoli.",

However, I really wasn't a fan of the unique Quinoa flavour combined with this dish.  I made this twice--once following the recipe (except I used 2% milk instead of skim) and decided it needed a little bit more flavour, so the second time I added some paprika, garlic and onion powder to step 5.  I also cut up the tomatoes and mixed them throughout the quinoa, and added some extra cheese, and crumbled bacon over the top.  Whole family agreed it was much better with the additions!  My husband and toddler both liked it, but as I wasn't a fan, I won't be making it again.  Thanks anyway for the new idea!",
