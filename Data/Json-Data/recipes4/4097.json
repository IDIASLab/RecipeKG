The bone-in chicken wings plus all the other ingredients adds lots of flavor. But if you're like me and hate rubbery, gummy chicken skins, I used skinless boneless chicken breast because the chicken broth adds lots of flavor. Thanks for posting this recipe.",

When I visit the Phillipines, one of my favorite Filipino dishes is Arroz Caldo and this is even better than what I'm used to getting there! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out superb! My Filipino wife LOVED it and wants me to make more. I want to make more! I did not find it to be overly salty as some reviewers complained of. If, however, you do not normally use much salt you may want to use unsalted chicken broth. Also, instead of lemon, I was able to procure some calamansi lime which is served in the Phillipines with this dish and made it very authentic for me. Happily, and without reservation, I give this a 5-star, two thumbs up rating.",

I only use the fish sauce to taste 4. I use Jasmine rice because it's what I usually have on hand 5. I squeeze lemon juice over the pot while it's cooking to really incorporate the lemon flavour.

The recipe is easy to follow.  I have to add, I *hate* the smell of fish sauce.  However, once you add the broth it's fine, and I can't argue with the excellent end result. :)  So those of you who add it and think they ruined it, you didn't, and it'll be fine.  I'm sure it'd be great without it, too.",
