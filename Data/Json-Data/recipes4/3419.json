I used a large chicken that was marked down. I couldn't fit both oranges inside my chicken with the garlic cloves and butter, so I just used the one. I made the spice mixture and kind of mushed the rosemary and thyme in my hands to not only break up the spices but to bring out the flavor. I took the suggestions of other cooks and roasted it breast down in the beginning and just flipped it near the end with the foil off, to make it pretty and brown. This made for extremely moist and tender breast pieces. I asked my husband to pick out a roast chicken and I admit that I was skeptical at first. It turned out great.\nI plan on keeping the carcass and juice and making chicken broth. For your money,\noranges are always cheap as is garlic and spices. Using the carcass to make chicken broth, you really stretch your money. You could even half the butter and use homemade broth like I did and still come out ahead. This recipe is great! I'd make this again, no question.\nGreat job, Nellie. ",

I zested about a teaspoon of the orange peel then combined it with the herbs and softened butter and smooshed it under the skin. I added the orange halves to the clean cavity. I skipped the broth altogether and dry roasted on a rack while covered with foil at 400 degrees. You will have to calculate time based on the size of your bird. I uncovered the bird the last 30 minutes to brown. Even without the broth, there were alot of juices in the pan, so I put them in a small pan and reduced them to create a nice glaze for serving. Yummy! I have done a similar recipe using lemons for years and truthfully they are both great.",
