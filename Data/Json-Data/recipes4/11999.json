I used regular cabbage instead of Napa which was great and I am not a big cabbage eater.  Used cubed ham and didn't have Cajun seasoning so I added some chili powder, onion and garlic powder, cayenne, salt, pepper, basil and oregano instead.  I didn't serve over rice but that would be good!  We loved the flavor.  Oh...and I left out the Water Chestnuts.  Didn't have them, but didn't think they would have gone well in this dish anyway.",
