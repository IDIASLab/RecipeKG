I'm not sure it would still be traditional au Gratin but I think next time I'll layer some cheese between the fish and sauce for more melty goodness and less of a bubbly skin on top (which is still delicious lol). While this recipe doesn't have the complexity and layers of flavor that other more gourmet-types do with scores of herbs peppers etc. I feel it's really unfair for people to mark down this recipe and claim it's tasteless because of that. If you want to go ahead and doll the recipe up that's fine but it's unfair to the submitter to dock stars or whatnot because of that. Thank you for sharing:)",

Also with the sauce I added some cheese to give it a better taste poured that over the fish and used cheddar and a bit of swiss on the top then put the whole thing in the broiler until the cheese browned. The results were pretty good and I think I'd make it again.",

Newfoundland food is mostly seasoned with salt and thats about it - not every region's food is hot and spicy!",
