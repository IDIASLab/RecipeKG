I don't think I will ever try making it as the recipe says.  I used 12 medium sized new red potatoes and cut them into quarters.  I boiled them for almost 15 minutes.  I then mixed the potatoes, cheese, and ranch dressing, along with 1/3 c of chopped green onions, and placed them in a 2 quart casserole dish. I baked it for about 10 minutes and it came out wonderful.  Some of the potatoes will break down so it is more of a casserole type dish.  One word of caution - pick your ranch dressing carefully.  Since the potatoes and cheese are very mild in flavor, the taste of your dressing will really stand out.  Pick a mild flavored ranch.  I tried using a Bacon Ranch, and I thought the bacon flavor was a little too strong.  With the medium sized potatoes, I ended up with enough food for 8.  I didn't add any extra dressing or cheese either.  In fact, next time I may cut it back just a little.  This one is a keeper!",

After they were cooked I put them in a casserole dish and spread the dressing on and then sprinkled the cheese over the top. I stirred it together and then put in the oven. I think this was a bit easier than fussing with each individual potato half. These are best right out of the oven the leftovers weren't as tasty. Overall this recipe is delicious-we all enjoyed it!",

Even my finicky 13-month-old gobbled them down in no time! This is a great recipe because its so quick and packed with flavor. I modified it a little like most everyone else. I boiled 11 potatoes for a little over 15 minutes and quartered them (although next time I'd slice slice them thick) put them in a 2-quart casserole dish covered with just over a cup of ranch 2/3 cup of chopped green onions and 1 1/2 cups of shredded colby jack cheese. I baked them for almost 10 minutes and they were fantastic. This will definitley be a regular at our dinner table!",

Instead of boiling I put them in a greased 4x5.5\" pan. I sprinkled Italian seasonings and garlic salt on top. Baked in 350 for 50 minutes. Drizzled ranch and cheese over top and mixed potatoes up. Then sprinkled crushed seasoned croutons on top and put in oven for another 5 minutes. So so good! Will definately put this one in the recipe box! Thanks!",
