I tossed everything in the crock pot before work and came home to...well I'm not sure it can be called a \"soup\"; it was more like \"cheesy potatoes\". There was some significant stickage to the sides (I'd sprayed it too) but that is my fault as the recipe calls for intermittent stirring. While the taste is fine the texture is just a bit too gluey for me. I fought the urge to add stock to it this morning and now I wish I had. It's not something you'd serve guests but it is certainly worth trying for yourself to see if it's up your alley. THANKS for the recipe!",
