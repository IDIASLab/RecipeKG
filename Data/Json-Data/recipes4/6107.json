Also---I always add lemon-juice into anything that browns one tablespoon works well enough for most dishes. Then the end image wont look as bad as the photograph pictured. In the end...the dish was too vinegary for my taste-buds so I drained it and tossed some parmesan and romano cheese on top. Now I like it! When I make this again I'm going to use half the vinegar.",

I used fresh brussel sprouts for this and skipped the garlic powder as there were already 2 cloves of fresh garlic in the recipe.",
