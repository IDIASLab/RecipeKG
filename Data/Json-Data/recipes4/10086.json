I doubled the recipe for mushroom soup - 2 cans and 1 cup water (Not onion soup mix)and added a stalk of chopped celery and sliced fresh mushrooms.Also instead of water you can add 1 can of LOW Sodium beef broth. Cooked it on high for 5 hours, adding the carrots(small bag of baby carrots) and potatoes for the last 2 hours. I made fresh bread to suck up the gravy. YUMMY!!!.Thank you for sharing this recipe Katy. I just want to add that I smushed my potatoes before taking the photo - I was so hungry from the smell I almost forgot to take the photo.",

If I don't have that, I use regular dry onion with beef broth instead of water.  I sear the beef before starting in a bit of garlic oil.  Not required but keeps the beef flavor full.  I also put a dash of worchestershire sauce in.  This also works with a pot roast (chuck).  Just add an extra can of mushroom soup. If you like your vegetables a bit more al dente, steam them to desired and ad to pot and serve.  If you like wine in your sauces then use red like merlot instead of water.",
