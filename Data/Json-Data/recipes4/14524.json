Also used my own homemade chicken stock. Flavour is very nice and the thyme and basil work well together which suprised me.",

Really enjoyed the crunchiness of the bean spouts and the fresh ginger and spices.  Could have put more fish into the soup as it adds a perfect balance to the spiciness.  It was a 33c August day, when I made this but my husband and I till enjoyed the heat of the soup while outside at the lake.",
