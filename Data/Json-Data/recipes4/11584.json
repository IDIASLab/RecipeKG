You bet I'm keeping this one handy. \r\n\r\nMy edits - 3x the chili paste, low sodium soy sauce (next time I'll cut that in half), no oil or ground pepper, and the garlic was in the chili paste so I left that off. I also added some curry.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS... I have made this quite a few times now and I must revise my above edits. I don't use the chili paste anymore as I realized that was what was making the dish so salty. Now I just add plenty of ground red pepper. I no longer bother with the curry powder either. I also like to make extra peanut sauce, thin it with water and add it to veggies towards the end. I like to stir fry onion, asparagus, mushrooms and peppers. Then I just put the chicken on top and serve. So good I'm getting hungry!!\r\n",

First of all I trimmed the fat from my chicken breasts (I used the whole breasts) and pierced them several times with a fork. I them placed them in a ziploc bag with the sauce and marinated them for 4 hours. I baked them on a rack in a shallow foil-lined pan at 350 degrees for 45 minutes and then broiled them about 6 inches from the heat for another 10 minutes, turning once. This set the sauce on them and gave them a very nice appearance. Oh, I almost forgot, I also mixed up a separate batch of the marinade and used it to baste with while baking. They were very moist and fork tender. Can't wait to try them in the summer when I can grill them over some wood and get the flavor of the wood smoke in them!",
