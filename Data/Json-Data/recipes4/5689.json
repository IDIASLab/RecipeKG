It wasn't until I got home and reached the last step in the directions that I realized that I needed TWO bags of tater tots.  Make sure you have enough...you will need it.  \n\nI suppose one day I may try this with the Greek yogurt and onion soup mix, but honestly..I loved it so much with my substitutes that I may just continue making it my way.

I also used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken since I was using beef in it and not just tater tots. I figure this recipe would've been just as great had I followed it by the letter",
