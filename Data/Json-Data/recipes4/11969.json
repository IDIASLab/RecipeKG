Upon tasting at the two-hour mark I was disturbed that all I could taste was pepper so I removed as many of the black peppercorns as I could at that point and added in the half a teaspoon of the allspice I had withheld based on another cook's comment. I hoped the full dose of allspice would mellow it out but could not taste it in the end. The final product was bland boiled beef with beef broth with a lot of heat at least for this Northerner but no taste. It is edible but felt this was not worth the effort and definitely will not make again.",
