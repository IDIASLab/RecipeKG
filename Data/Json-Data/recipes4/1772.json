I thought the horseradish went really well with carrots. I followed this recipe exactly, I used dried breadcrumbs, not fresh. When I mixed the crumb/mayo mixture it was very dry and I couldn't spread it over the carrots at all. If using dried crumbs be sure to add more mayo until you get a mixture that is of spreading consistency. My mixture was more of a crumbly topping, which was fine, but next time I'll play around with the mayo mixture. Equal parts of mayo and crumbs just don't seem to work well if looking to spread this, as the recipe states. I will make this again with some tweaking. Thanks (:",

It is milder when mixed with all the carrots, and the amount can be adjusted so there is just a hint until kids get used to the taste.",
