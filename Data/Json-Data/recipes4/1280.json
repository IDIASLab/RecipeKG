Also, buy the best prosciutto that you can afford, ths helps with the saltiness factor. Elegant, & good either warm or chilled!",

It stands up to the cream cheese much better and goes very nicely with the asparagus.  I've made this before as a cold appetizer and it's great that way too.  To do this, boil the asparagus for 1-2 minutes (depending on thickness) just until slightly softened.  Immediately immerse in ice water.  Drain and blot dry.  Assemble as directed and refrigerate.  You should boil the asparagus even for the cooked version or it will be crunchy.  I found that if you boil the asparagus you should reduce the oven time to 7-8 minutes or the ham begins to get too crispy.  Really good either way.",

I also tried one asparagus spear and cream cheese w/ the prosciutto...I found that the saltiness of the prosciutto overpowered the single asparagus spear. This side dish is outstanding with asparagus bundles however! I would even recommend using many asparagus spears... I was disappointed because we ate all of the asparagus and didn't eat all of the prosciutto although i LOVE it! No salt needed it's salty enough! My advice: add more asparagus.",
