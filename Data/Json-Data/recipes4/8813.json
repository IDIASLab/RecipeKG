I make it a few ways but my favorite is made by using 28oz can of fire roasted tomatoes w green chilies. I add baby Bella mushrooms heads of asparagus and onions to the sauce along with garlic cumin and spicy paprika. I have even used okra in place of asparagus if you want to go another route. If I am unhappy with spice level I will add some chipotle to give it some kick or throw some dried chilies into the mix. Salt and pepper to taste. Add parsley on top and enjoy.",

Only other change was to add a teeny pinch of sugar to the tomatoes to cut the acidity. I liked this a lot and will make again! Thanks Lisa!",

I had trouble getting the egg to cook on top though and finally had to cover the pan after more than five minutes of cooking and the whites on top were still transparent. I didn't have whole tomatoes so I used chunky crushed tomatoes. I diced up my onion and peppers very small as I prefer them that way. I will definitely make this again it was very very good.
