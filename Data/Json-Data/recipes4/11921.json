It took about 45 minutes to chop all the veggies (which my lovely husband did while I pain-stakingly picked every ounce of meat off the bones). I browned the chunks/shreds of lamb in the pot before adding the remaining ingredients. For me it was easier than fishing the bones out of the stew. I also soaked my chopped eggplant in salt water for about 30 min to an hour before cooking in stew (this helps to remove some of the bitterness from the eggplant). I also added a whole can (i think it was the 4 oz size) of tomato paste for a richer tomato base. The extra paste also helped thicken the liquid in this stew. I will be making this again and again. 4 for recipe as is but is 5 with the changes.",
