Added a tiny can of diced chilies.  Also added about a cup of beef broth.  Brought all of that to a boil and then dumped the elbows in uncooked.  Let it simmer for 15 min or so and then added the cheese.  Mmmm.  I actually used the Mexican flavored Velveeta.  Gave it a nice kick but still creamy.  This way it is a one-pot meal!  We enjoyed this very much and will make again!",
