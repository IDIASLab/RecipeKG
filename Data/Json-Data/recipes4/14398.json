Do not use thin strips of tenderized blackstrap in the pressure cooker and having a stainless steel pot in my electric pressure cooker prevented me from having drippings after browning the meat. The flavor on this recipe was fantastic! I will have to try it again and either use non tenderized meat in larger chunks in the pressure cooker or make it on the stove top if using the tenderized strips. Also my end product was too \"liquidy\" so I will add some thickener like flour or cornstarch at the end if too thin.",

I used a bit over 2 lbs of steaks probably closer to 3 lbs so not blaming the recipe for the lack of seasoning when I made this. Next time I'll be trying 2 tsp of Papa's seasoning to a 1/2 cup of flour to coat the meat. We felt there just wasn't enough flavor to the meat although overall the dish had a unique flavor profile. The red chilis I used were not hot so plan to add a pinch of red pepper flakes into the pot before sealing the lid next time. Aside from those 2 changes will continue to make this as-is over & over! We used the meat made tacos with a garlic cilantro lime rice and avocado/tomato/corn salad on the side. Really delicious!",
