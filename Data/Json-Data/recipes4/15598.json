Once you get the hang of this it is relatively easy. Lime rinds are pretty tough. I used 13 limes and all but 1 came out perfect. A 3oz. box of jello filled 10 halved limes (so 40 wedges). I put cupcake liners in a muffin tin and placed a lime half in each well. You can lean them against the edge to keep them level. I made them the night before and let them set up all night. To cut the halves into wedges you need to turn the lime face down so you cut through the rind first and don't destroy the jello. I used Pucker (watermelon flavored vodka). For me they were a little strong. I made these for a club party and everyone loved them. I had people following me around to try to steal seconds and thirds. They are time consuming but were the hit of the party. Without liquor they would be a great party treat for kids. I am pretty sure people will be begging me to make them again and again!!!",
