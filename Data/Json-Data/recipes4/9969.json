Just a few things that the \"recipe' people changed from my original recipe: 1) I always use butter not margarine, 2) I always use roasted garlic flavored chicken broth so if you use regular chicken broth try adding a few cloves of minced garlic, and 3) recently I've substituted 1/4 cup of the liquids with 1/4 cup sherry cooking wine.  Of all the recipes I've created, this one is by far my favorite!  Take care!",

I made a few changes to suit what I had on hand: I used 3 stalks celery (not a big celery fan) a small bag of carrots and two onions all medium chopped and only 1 1/2 cups white rice. As other reviewers mentioned I replaced 1 1/2 cups water with 1 1/4 cups more broth (I didn't have any boullion) and 1/4 cup sherry. When making the roux I added 3 tablespoons of store-jarred minced garlic for extra flavor. After simmer it was a bit too thick so I ended up adding more milk using almost a half gallon in the whole recipe. I seasoned with lots of salt pepper garlic and poultry seasoning. Rather than poaching the chicken like I normally might I seasoned a couple of chicken breasts with salt pepper Old Bay garlic and onion and cooked them on a flat top grill in a bit of olive oil. It was a great time saver and added an extra flavor boost. This recipe is definetly a keeper. I look forward to adding other ingredients for different flavors. Great!",

Old Bay toward the end. I also sauteed the veggies in butter/oil first before adding the broth - this gave it a great \"cooked all day\" taste.\nThis soup gets very thick, very fast, so be mindful how much flour/milk you are adding.

It had the potential to be good if you were to made adjustments.  Firstly, if you use 2 cups of rice, this will not be a soup it will be a ricey stew, I would cut it to 1 cup of rice.  You need to add your own seasonings as it is very bland as is...I would put 5x the bouillion and garlic in it next time.  Once cup of margarine is crazy, I used 1/2 and that was enough.  I won't make this recipe again as I now have a pot of gloopy rice stew that I am tired of seasoning and reseasoning...now the dog gets it.\r\n",
