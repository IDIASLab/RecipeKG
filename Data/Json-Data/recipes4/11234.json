They were not a hit with my family. Although the filling was good the pastry was thick and very dry (perhaps the whole wheat flour was the culprit here?). The maximum amount of filling I could fit in one was about 2/3 cup and this was even after rolling out the dough to 9\" diameter. After making the eight pasties I still ended up with 8 cups of vegetable mixture left over (it won't go to waste). Unless you have a really LARGE skillet you may find you'll need a large roasting pan to cook the veggies. Use a small turnip; this will reduce the amount of excess. 45 minutes baking time was more than necessary. I removed my final batch after 35 min. and the pastry was just as hard as if I had left it in for the full 45 min.",

When they ate them hours later they were still warm.The making of a pastie is a long laborious procedure.On that note I will give a 4 star rating as the filling was tasty..But...I will still make a true pastie once in a while.",
