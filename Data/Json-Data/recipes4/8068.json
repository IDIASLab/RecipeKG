This roasted up so beautifully and was perfectly tender, moist and flavorful. This is a new favorite, for sure~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)",

This is better than the peruvian rubs I've tried according to the family. Note that the orange zest doesn't really come through except in the dark meat on the bottom of the bird. Perhaps I'll double it on the next go-round. It's simple and well worth trying.",
