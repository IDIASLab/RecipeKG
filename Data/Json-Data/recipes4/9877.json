                "reviewBody": "This recipe has potential. Things I don't like: 1.) This recipe assumes you are using a particular type of rice. I won't work if you are using quick cook white rice or a longer cook brown or jasmine rice. Maybe it would be more beneficial to list the amount of cooked rice needed rather than give the instructions for cooking the rice. 2.) For a dish with so much butter I think this dish was a little bland. I think adding a couple of different herbs and a liberal amount of salt and pepper make it a great recipe. 3.) Less butter. The butter isn't necessary. I usually skip it without consequence. The things I do like: 1.) Lots of veggies. I also added sliced fresh mushrooms. I am sure others can be added without taking away from the essence of the casserole. 2.) Spinach and cheese! The combination of ingredients is appealing to me spinach being key. It is also flexible. The corn bell peppers and onions can be substituted with whatever you have (given it is not too overwhelming).",
