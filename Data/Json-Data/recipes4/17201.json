                "reviewBody": "Delicious! This soup has become a family favourite. We like a thicker soup so we add 1.5 cups of lentils and we cook it with the ham bone, which enhances the flavour. The celery was omitted, as we don't like celery. Also, we use Red Lentils. They're delicate in texture and eventually start to breakdown, giving the soup a thicker, creamier texture. For this reason, I also cut the carrots and ham into fine pieces. I highly recommend making the soup at least one day in advance. Your taste buds will thank you for it. Overall, I would say it is an excellent recipe. Easy to make and full of flavour.",

I made this with bacon instead of cooked ham, saut\u00e9ing the bacon with the veggies and lentils at the beginning. I followed the notes for a smoky flavour by adding 1 1/2 tsp of smoked paprika. I cooked everything, including the bacon, mustard, pepper and paprika in a pressure cooker all at once for 13 minutes. It came out perfectly balanced in both flavour and consistency. The lentils were slightly al dente-which I enjoy. I was weary of the mustard powder but it works here. I suggest adding the paprika. This is very good soup that will surprise you - not just another lentil soup, trust me. Thank you MermyGirl for sharing your family's treasure!",

Wasn't sure about adding vinegar so only added 1 tablespoon which was enough to perk up the flavor along with the light teaspoon of dry mustard and about 1/2 teaspoon smokey paprika (almost forgot, 2 bay leaves and a tsp of thyme & a few sprinkles of Italian seasoning).  My hubby was skeptical (because it was lentils) but had 3 bowls of it! He loved it and so did I.  Next time I'll add 2 tablespoons of vinegar:)",
