In the first place the rice is way out of proportion with all other ingredients. In the second place there's absolutely no flavor. In the third place it's super SUPER dry. I like my fried rice either full of flavor or saucy or both. This was neither. It might be a decent base for whatever flavor you'd like to add - but it is NOT a good \"stand alone\" recipe. Also I would double the amount of peas eggs salmon onions - or cut the rice in half. But we won't be making it again.",

I varied a lot from the recipe but the heart of it was still there. I used a fried rice mix (which had a seasoning packet)so there was only about 1/3 of the rice there was supposed to be but I still used more peas than called for the same amount of salmon the same amount of onion etc. I also didn't have green onions but I had a Chile pepper so I added that. All in all a really great fried rice recipe that I will turn to often. Thanks so much!",
