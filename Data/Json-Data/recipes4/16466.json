                "reviewBody": "This is a good way to prepare cauliflower, but I need to make a few changes next time.  This recipe really needs a large wok to make successfully, I think.  It nearly overwhelmed my 12 inch skillet.  First of all, I think the meat needs to be seasoned.  A classic way to prepare a Chinese dish is to heat the oil (usually peanut oil, because of the high smoke point) with a couple of slices of ginger, and some sliced garlic.  When they brown, remove them from the oil, and then add the meat.  The flavored oil, along with some soy sauce at this point, would help the meat to have some flavor.  Also, instead of green onions, next time I will sub 1/2 to 1 onion, chopped, to saute with at least 3 cloves of garlic.  My skillet wasn't really large enough to handle the eggs, so I need to cook them to soft scramble stage in a separate pan.  Last, use the sesame oil as a seasoning, instead of a cooking oil, along with the chopped green onions.  I used much more than the 6 tablespoons recommended in the recipe.  Agree with another reviewer, this recipe is very filling.",

It become detrimental to health when it's composition is changed thru heat.  Use peanut, coconut or olive oil when making this dish as I will do.  Then toast sesame seeds and drizzle the oil and the seeds over the dish before serving.   You'll get a stronger taste of sesame this way and no ill effects to your health.",

Hubby said it's up there with his other favourite recipe from AR. That is one high praise. I wasn't sure that straight veggies and pork was going to be enough for my big boys, so I made some rice anyways to add to the dish. The rice is now in my freezer. It was totally unnecessary. The directions don't tell you when to add the peas so I added them to the wok with the pork on it's second round. I also nuked the peas rather than use the stove top. I am so glad I tried this recipe. As another reviewer bd.weld said, \"definitely a keeper\". Thanks so much John Melinte!",

Unrefined sesame oil is best used for dressing or topping vs cooking as it is very flavorful in its pure state. Dark sesame oil has a lower smoke point and no oil should be cooked beyond the point of smoke...if it smokes, toss everything and start over.",

I had imagined so many adaptations to the recipe before I had actually made it (i.e. marinate the meat; switch up the pork for a combination of pork, chicken, and shrimp; add hot pepper sauce and/or fresh grated ginger) but I don't think there is much room for improvement in this recipe \"as written\" now that I have made it. If I didn't know that it was made with cauliflower, I would have never guessed (although the reheated \"leftovers\" did taste like cauliflower, but still delicious). My large \"average\" cauliflower yielded 40 ounces of shredded cauliflower, so a small cauliflower would have been enough. I deviated from the recipe only slightly: used garden-fresh peas (not frozen) and cooked them with the vegetables (not separately); added a couple stalks of diced celery and a cup of sliced button mushrooms (which were in my fridge needing to be used up); doubled up on the garlic (personal taste); and used gluten-free low-sodium tamari (not regular gluten-containing soy sauce). I also used toasted sesame oil for the classical Chinese flavor (not almost flavorless plain sesame oil). Thank you John Melinte for sharing your recipe.",
