As my husband finished off his bowl he said \"This recipe is definately a keeper!\" The spice makes it a bit different from your average beef stew. I thought it was pretty quick and easy. It takes a long time to cook and you have to soak the beans so plan ahead but it was nice to come home to dinner with very little time spent in the kitchen.",

After fishing the meat out and transferring it to the crockpot, I deglazed the pan with the red wine to get all those yummy crunchy bits into the stew. I did not add potatoes to this recipe (because I was serving it over leftover mashed potatoes) and I went light on the cayenne only because I was serving this to my husband and two kids. Not a bad stew, seems to be a little thin to me. I did have to thicken it up a bit with a little cornstarch slurry. I would make this again but double up on the veggies next time.",
