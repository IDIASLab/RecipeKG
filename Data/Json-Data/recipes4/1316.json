With the beef presauteed this would be a VERY quick easy meal. Seems like a cross between baked beans and chili. You can add or omit as you see fit. I sauteed the ground beef with garlic onion coriander cumin chopped carrots and chipotle peppers. Then threw in the beans tomatoes and corn. I also added a can mild chilis. I served it over brown rice but it would be good over potatoes too (maybe cowboy mashed potatoes from this site).",

I didn't have any canned corn so I used a 16 oz. bag of frozen corn and it worked just fine. I didn't drain the kidney beans to make up for the water that would have been in the canned corn. I didn't use a separate skillet to brown the ground beef--I simply browned the beef and cooked the onions together in my stew pot before draining and adding the remaining ingredients. I used 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and that seemed to add just the right amount of seasoning. Good stuff! Nice alternative to chili.",
