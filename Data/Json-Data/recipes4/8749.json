I've made it about four or five times now for parties and the last time I made it, it came out great. I only made a few changes, mainly just in the way it's preped.   STRAIN THE SALSA AND JALAPENOS. Canned and jarred salsa and jalapenos have a lot of water in them. I found that by taking some cheesecloth and a strainer and geting the majority of water out of the salsa before putting it in really helped. I also strained the jalapenos, maybe I was supposed to be doing this all along, but the first few times I didn't and the dip was soupy. (I was using canned jalapenos)  Even if you use chunky salsa it's still runny. For awhile I thought the runnyness was from the melted sour cream, but it's not. It's the salsa. So strain the salsa before adding it if you're going to use something store bought. Also this dip is really good if you get it all layered, and then put it in the fridge overnight until you need it. I usually make it the night before a party and cook it the day of the party, right before I leave the house. Just add about 15 minutes to the cook time if it's been in the refrigerator all night.   Also I haven't tried it, but I'm sure this dip would be good cold too. As in not cooked at all.",
