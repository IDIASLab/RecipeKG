I also doubled the spices, except for the red hot sauce (Sriracha, in my case).   Next time I will leave the quantity of tomatoes as is, but continue with the reduced water and doubled coconut milk and spices.  I used vegetarian chicken substitute and bottled lime juice, and we served it with the shredded pizza cheese we had on hand.  This was fantastic.  My fiance is a VERY picky eater, and he enjoyed it and said I should definitely make it again!  It has a nice warm spiciness to it, without being uncomfortably hot.  If I could give it six stars, I would.",

I made the following adjustments per our tastes: homemade chicken broth rotisserie chicken doubled all spices except allspice used a can juices of Rotel for the tomatoes light coconut milk. I used more chicken broth than the recipe calls for having a total yield of 11.5 cups of soup. In the future I will also add an onion because I can't see any good reason not to. Be free-handed with the lime juice it's the secret ingredient that makes everything come together. Your soup will only taste as good as your broth does -- so use a brand of bouillon or stock that you know and love!

Removed it from the pan then added the carrot ginger garlic and green onion and cooked until soft ( I chopped every thing small) deglazed the pan with the 6 cups water added the chicken flavor chicken and rice and cooked until the rice was done then I put in the rest of the ingredients and heated until hot.
