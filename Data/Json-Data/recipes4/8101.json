Our bird was given to us, so it was 1/3 larger than the recipe called for--no problem!  Cooking time seas easily adjusted, and, 2 hours later (no, REALLY!) We were crunching into the crispiest -skinned turkey imaginable. \nAt first, locating the backbone was tricky, but I peeked INSIDE the body/neck cavities for verification.
