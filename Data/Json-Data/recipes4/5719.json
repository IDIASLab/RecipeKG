I was a little worried about it being too dry at first but after the 3rd hour on high in the slow cooker it really got a nice broth. Overall it was great and everyone said the flavor was awesome. I prefer my chili on the spicier side so I just added some fresh jalapeno slices and cayenne hot sauce on top of my shredded cheese and sour cream. My one friend who doesn't really like anything too spicy said it was perfect. I will definitely make this again!",
