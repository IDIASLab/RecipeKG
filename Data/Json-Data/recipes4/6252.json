I'm pretty sure (almost positive) that if you substitute veggie for chicken stock its vegetarian, if you remove the sour cream from it it should be VEGAN if I'm not mistaken :))))! (only about 80% sure on that). This soup DESERVES its 5 star ratings.  It not only serves as a perfectly tasty recipe stand alone it is SUPER versatile!  I made my BB's from scratch used half of my own homemade salsa and half a can of tomatoes because I'm bad and didn't see they didn't have green chilies in them.   Topped it with a tiny bit of cheddar, sour cream, and cilantro...  AMAZING!! Thanks a ton.  \n                                                     Joe",

As to Fran's rating that said it was too high in sodium with lower sodium choices in beans and broth that was easily adjusted. And I agree with others who said salt could be omitted.
