Spaghetti sauce with about 3 ounces of water. I topped this with a can of Immaculate Baking crescent rolls; since these are dairy free (and wonderful!). This came out delicious! Thank you Michelle!",

I always cook things separate and mix them together later. So I cooked  the mixed vegetables in some vegetable stock and cooked them to about 90% set aside. I used beef sausage instead of the Italian sausage. I also used the crescent dough on the bottom as well. I rolled the dough out in the pan and cooked it for about 20 minutes and put the mixture on top of the cooked dough. Then I put the cheese on top of the mixture and then put another layer of crescent dough on top and spread a tablespoon of butter on top of the dough. This was delicious! I was thinking maybe next time I'll add some sour cream to this mixture that seem to be a good addition to this recipe. Great recipe Michele!",

When it melted, I served the casserole and the underside of the rolls were gooey. Kind of reminded me of Shepherd's pie, without the mashed potatoes. ADDENDUM: I have decided this is much better the second and third day. Flavors were married beautifully. I was still disappointed the crescent rolls didn't bake up better. I do think biscuits would be great on top but make sure they are cooked all the way through.",
