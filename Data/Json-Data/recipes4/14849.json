Substituted shredded carrot for the bell pepper, used 1 teaspoon of minced garlic, 2 teaspoons of Crystal hot sauce and used 1/2 2 egg portion of Egg Beaters instead of 1 egg. I baked first then browned in skillet w/olive oil. I melted thinly sliced low-fat cheddar cheese on top to get that 'cheeseburger' experience.

As others suggested I used oats rather then bread crumbs which made the consistency easy to cook and eat (as well as not adding too much sodium to the mix).  I cooked the quinoa with a quarter cube of vegetarian bullion, and topped the burgers with homemade guacamole,  fresh tomatoes and spring mix and served them on whole wheat kaiser rolls. Overall a very excellent recipe.",

I read several reviews/suggestions first to help me adapt what I had on hand, and the recipe is, as pointed out by several, totally forgiving.  I doubled the cooked quinoa amount, subbed old-fashioned rolled oats for bread crumbs, had to use reconstituted Penzey minced onion since I was out of fresh, and to make it VEGAN, I simply used 1 TBL ground chia seed mixed with 3 TBL water to replace the egg.  The 1st time I made these, I had to use part green pepper and part red non-hot peppers growing in my deck containers, worked beautifully.  Today, I actually had a yellow pepper, and I doubled the recipe using 1 can black beans and 1 can kidney beans (adds a nice reddish color), still used whole rolled oats and chia-egg sub.....the Frank's Hot Sauce is just the perfect amount, adds a lot of character with the cumin, without being too spicy.  Be sure to mix with hands as suggested. This recipe is a KEEPER.  I doubled it today in hopes of having enough to freeze, if my husband does not eat them all today!",

I subbed a can of organic navy beans for the black beans, used 1/2 of a green pepper instead of yellow, upped the onion and garlic, and ground some organic stuffing mix in my mini food processor to replace the bread crumbs (I also doubled the bread to make sure they would bind together.) I added about 2 teaspoons of vegetarian worchester sauce, and left out the cumin. I also subbed the egg with ground flax seed (works every time!) Then I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes per side.
