Some have mentioned that the sauce is too sweet or tastes too much like tomato sauce.  My guess is that the wrong prepared salsa is being used.  You need to use a high quality prepared FRESH salsa, not that nasty stuff in jars or cans that is mostly tomato sauce.  I usually find it in the deli section of my grocery store.  It comes in mild, medium, or hot.  I prefer the medium, but if you think this recipe is too hot or not hot enough, use the mild or hot versions.  If you want it even hotter, add some chopped jalapenos.  When I called the sauce spicy, I meant using lots of spices, not \"hot\" spicy.  Also, it is not critical if you don't want to simmer the meat sauce for the extra time.  I just think the extra simmering gives the spices a chance to meld with the meat for a better flavor and it also thickens the sauce.  I made this several times before I submitted it to make sure I got the spices right.  The red sauce also makes a very tasty salsa.  Enjoy!",

I cut the paste down to two TBS,  this cut down enormously on the sweetness. I now buy the paste in a tube, no more finding a can in the refrigerator with a spot of mold in it. :-)",

                "reviewBody": "I really liked this recipe, much more than the one I was using before. And the fact that's from scratch make me like it even more. I don't live in the US, so \"use a can of ... or a package of ...\" very often don't work for me, just because I can't buy it here. Not sure I would anyway, thinking how things taste better when they are made from scratch, and also I can control what I add to it. \nThough I had to make few small changes to fit my taste. First of all, I am not a huge fan of a very spicy food, so I cut the chili powder on half and it was still very spicy for me (though my husband loved it :) Next time will add even less. Second, I used a large can (28oz) of tomatoes with juice mashed with blender until smooth) and cut tomato paste in half, omitted basil and cut chicken broth to 1.5 cups (because I already had more liquid in tomatoes). Third, I didn't understand why you need to keep cooking the meat sauce for 30 more minutes after adding cheese.. I cooked it for 20 min or so, added cheese, covered with lid and turned off the heat. Followed the recipe in other steps, will make it again!",
