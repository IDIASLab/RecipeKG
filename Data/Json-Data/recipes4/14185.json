Also did not have chili ketchup so I used reg ketchup and spiced it up with a 1/4 cup homemade Thai sweet chili sauce with added 1/4 cup small frozen berries w/pomegranate in the pot but I omitted the water and the flakes since the Thai sweet chili sauce was spicy already.Added one finely diced red pepper for extra flavour. Also fried up the sausages like one of the reviewers said and it turned out fantastic. No leftovers and so glad I tried this with our roast dinner. The sweet sauce was great on the roast beef and on the mashed carrot/potatoes too.",
