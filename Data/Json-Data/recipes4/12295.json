To thicken the sauce you can try a couple of variations/substitions. Use an equivalent amount of tomato sauce in place of the tomatoes. This will cut down on the amount of prep time and be healthier as well because there will be more Lycopene. Another possible substitute is yogurt in place of the heavy cream (less fat). Lastly cook it uncovered. This will thicken it even more. A wonderful recipe do not pass it up!!",

Instead of fresh tomatoes I used 1 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos and 1 8 oz can of tomato sauce. I doubled the garlic and chili powder. I also added some frozen peas halfway through. Recipe was still on the mild side heat-wise but had a great taste. Leftovers were even better! My only other complaint would be that the recipe is fairly oily. I'd scale back on the amount of oil called for.",

I read a bunch of reviews and based on them substituted low-fat yogurt for the heavy cream a can of tomato sauce for the fresh tomatoes and increased the Garam Masala slightly. It turned out wonderfully and I feel so much better that there isn't heavy cream in it (for a healthier meal). Other reviewers suggested substituting mushrooms for the bell pepper but I found the bell pepper adds a really nice flavor. I wouldn't substitute it at all it really adds a lot. Anyways that's my two cents:)",
