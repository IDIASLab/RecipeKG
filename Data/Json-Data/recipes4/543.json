Well, this recipe is just as good, if not better than store bought, the chicken was very tender.  I took another reviewers advise & cut the salt in 1/2 (because of the celery & garlic salts) but next time I will use the correct amount of salt & cut the celery salt in 1/2.  Thanks so much Sara, for the recipe & saving me some cash!",

Break up and put in food processor till all fine crumbs.  This made a little more than one cup of crumbs for me.    1/4 tsp salt 1/4 tsp paprika 1/4 tsp celery Seeds 1/4 tsp ground pepper 1/4 tsp garlic granules 1/4 tsp onion powder dash basil dash oregano  add all ingredients and process again till combined.  Place in large bag.  Add one piece of chicken at a time and shake till covered.    Bake chicken pieces on greased cookie sheet for about 40 minutes at 375 degrees.  Check temperature with internal thermometer and make sure it's at lease 165 degrees.  Yum!  We had cheese topped broccoli and rice on the side.  Double yum!",
