                "reviewBody": "This is a great recipe for people who don't like HOT wings.  I didn't change the recipe at all, but I did change the cooking method.  I marinated the chicken wings in the sauce for three hours.  Then I lined a cookie sheet (with sides) with the new non-stick foil.  I put the marinated wings on the cookie sheet and baked them for approximately 50 minutes.  They do brown very nicely.  I did not baste them.  When the wings were almost done  I brought the marinade to a boil in a large pot.  I boiled it for about two minutes.  I mixed 3 tbs. corn starch in a jar with some ice water, about 1/2 cup.  Slowly mix the corn starch mixture into the boiling marinade until it is the thickness you desire.  Adding the cold cornstarch mixture to the hot marinade keeps it from getting lumpy.  I don't know why this works, but it does.  (Also works for gravy).  When the marinade is the thickness you desire, turn it off.  When the wings are done, add them to the pot and mix to coat with the thickened marinade.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve.  Great recipe.",

These don't need a change..they are yummi and gooey!! Take the freedom to be sloppy..and you won't be able to resist the finger lickin! One person mentioned cooking sauce seperately for basting...but if you fill your tinfoil lined pan with 1/4\" of the sauce while baking the wings, you just baste with that..it's hot and yummy and available for dipping in the end.

I also did not bother re-bastinging the wings or turning them but be sure to grease your pan! Better yet use foil over a pan and grease that.",

The only other change I made to the recipe was using a tbp. of chile paste instead of the sauce. I think it added some extra heat but we liked it! Ooop's there was one more change I put the marinade in a saucepan & cooked it down some because you shouldn't use sauce you marinaded raw chicken in to baste with unless you cook it @ a higher temp to kill the bacteria. I reduced it some & then thickened it up w/ cornstarch mixed in cold water before basting the chicken. These were fantastic...like a spicy asian BBQ. Normally if I have leftovers I either make something different out of them or send them home w/ my son but he is going to miss out on these;o)...we are going to turn around & have them for dinner again tonight. They are soo good! I served them w/ microwave corn on the cob (topped w/ garlic parmesan butter mix) & sesame green beans (both from this site) but I'll make different sides tonight to shake it up some.",

Cooked them for the 50 minutes at 375 and then kicked the heat down to 350 for another 20 minutes and the meat just fell off the bone.
