Beat cream cheese until smooth.  Add pudding mix and beat to incorporate. Slowly add milk, mixing thoroughly.  Don\u2019t worry about small lumps; the hot Jello will work them out.\n2.  Combine the Jello and boiling water, mixing to dissolve.\n3.  Slowly pour the hot Jello into the pudding mixture, beating continuously.\n4.  Pour the filling into the crust and refrigerate until firm, about 2-3 hours (over-night is best).\n\nFor those who can have the sugar and fat, and don't enjoy the artificial flavor, just use full fat and sugar ingredients.  I'm sure that'll taste even better!",

Info that's good to know: Taste and texture is more like a mild Key Lime pie than cheesecake. I used a 8x8 glass Pyrex dish and it still came out great prob. better (made it thicker). I baked the crust an extra 5 minutes. I added about 2 Tbsp of Splenda as well. Gelatin doesn't get \"thick\" - I tried to let it sit to get \"thick\" and after 1 hour of sitting it was still very much like the original state. I used it anyway and it turned out great. Other than that I'll be adding additional lime or lemon extract to make it just a tad stronger in flavor. Overall I find it amazing that this isn't loaded with sugar - it's beyond delicious and I'll be making it for myself as a somewhat guiltless pleasure!",
