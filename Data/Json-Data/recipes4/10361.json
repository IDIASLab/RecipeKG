Warning all recipes usually need to have seasonings added per one's own taste. I also used homemade cream of broccoli soup with from scratch vegetable stock. I did not have cauliflower to add. I substituted an egg for the water and added a little cheese. Turned out like risotto only much easier. Thanks for the recipe; but I usually alter all of them. Hope these ideas help someone else too.",
