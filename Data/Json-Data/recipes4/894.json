I read all of the reviews and made mashed potatoes my own way (margarine 2% milk lots of garlic reduced fat sour cream etc etc all to taste) and then just added the green onions and thawed spinach. The thing about making mashed potatoes as per someone else's recipe is that potatoe sizes vary so much that you really need to do it all to taste and not w/ standard measurements. That is just my 2 cents though:)",
