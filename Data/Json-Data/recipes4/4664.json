                "reviewBody": "Very similar to Arugula Caprese Salad also from this site. If you use the ingredients to taste rather than strictly measuring I like this recipe better. The amount of onions is overkill; almost 3 T. minced for one serving! I did reduce that significantly and just kind of sliced the onion instead of mincing it. I do love the mix of spinach with the arugula the mild spinach a nice counterpoint to mellow the sharper peppery arugula. Unfortunately I had no spinach on hand to add yet it was still delicious. I had a similar vinaigrette leftover from another salad one I had adjusted to the 3:1 oil to vinegar ratio I prefer. The red onion added the slightest bite and flavor contrast to wake this up. Because I had it to add and because this was so similar to a salad I had just days ago I added artichokes and black olives. (And some leftover cannellini bean salad and broken crostini once I took the photos:) Hubs had a dinner meeting this evening so this was a perfect dinner alone meal for me along with a glass of my favorite Cab and a beautiful Naples sunset.",
