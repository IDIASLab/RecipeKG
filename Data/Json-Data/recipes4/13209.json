So this is a combination of what I remember from the recipe and other Keema Matar recipes that I found on-line. You can substitute chopped tomatoes for the paste, and add 1/4 -1/2 cup water to make the sauce. Serve over rice. Enjoy!",

For people not used to this kind of food I suggest adding a little at a time and taste - alot of Indian spices are a real acquired taste. I personally added way more garlic and also some Patak's garlic chutney. It was good but not something I would make again.",

I made it with Patak's mild curry paste and it tasted alright before I started adding more spices much better after following some commenters' advice and poking around to see what the more elaborate keema recipes recommend. I added cumin garam masala chili powder (I like it spicy) and cinnamon a little at a time to taste. The cinnamon was the MVP it smelled heavenly and tasted great! The only change I'll make for round two - I like a more finely ground lamb than what I got from my local Kroger. Will go to a butcher next time around to get the consistency right.",

My grocery store was out of the mild curry paste so I used the hot one - not really that spicy to my palate but it did add a little zesty note. I also used three cloves of garlic - one clove is NEVER enough lol. I will save this one and tweak it more to our tastes.",
