I substituted tomato sauce for the diced tomatos, brown sugar for the molasas, lemon juice for the lemons, and BBQ sauce for the Worchestire. I simmered them for only 1 hour and 15 minutes before cooking them in the oven because my ribs were boneless. They were so tender & the sauce was perfect. Thanks for sharing this!",
