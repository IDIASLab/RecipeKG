                "reviewBody": "This is the best recipe for red beans & rice on this site. It does need tweaking for your individual tastes, though. To make these red beans taste like the ones I grew up on in Louisiana, I did the following: Omitted the jalape\u00f1o. Cut the bell pepper by half. Used a generous amount of Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning. Subbed chicken broth for water & cut it down to 7 cups. Used the back of my spoon to smash up enough beans to make the whole pot creamy. Must! Use! Andouille! even if you have to order it online this is the ONLY way to get the authentic and unique flavor of the sausage right.  Regular sausage just isn't seasoned the same way or contains the same amount of spiciness. My central Texas grocery store has started carrying it, as does Whole Foods and other \"specialty stores\". I only had ham scraps instead of a ham hock but the andouille adds smoky flavor so I didn't miss the hock. Normally I'd use both the andouille & the ham hock.  For those omitting celery, you really need the \"holy trinity\" of onion, celery & bell pepper to call it authentic. Mince it finely and sautee it first if you have to.  Me, I just do a fine dice on the veggies and let them cook down in the pot.",

My mother cookd red beans & rice every Monday, always two bay leaves (left in the pot) whoever got a leaf was lucky.  Usually there would be sausage in it, but if had been a good week we would have fried pork chops. There was no such thing as Creole seasoning back then, if you wanted it hot you add Louisiana Hot Sauce (not Tabasco) to your bowl not the pot.  Red beans were usually cooked on Mondays so mothers could do the laundry without worrying about what was cooking on the stove.",

They are ALL creamy, though, accomplished  by smashing beans as noted by several folks.  Most restaurants serve smoked sausage on the side and season the beans with ham or a little andouille. One tip--don't add the salt until the end or it will prevent the beans from getting soft.",

I subbed hot sausage (from Hillshire Farms) for the andouille sausage and I used ham boullion instead of a ham hock. My only thing is that in the slow cooker the thing would not thicken- so I ended up pouring it into a pan and simmering for about 20 minutes to reduce the liquid. Next time I'll just use less liquid- probably more like 7-8 cups of water. Over all though it is a really tasty recipe that is pretty forgiving when it comes to adjusting here and there for your own taste.",
