One change I made since I was making it for people I didn't know very well, was instead of rye bread, I purchased at my local grocer an \"Asiago Cheese Loaf\" I think any firm bread would be great, but the cheese bread, along with the other ingredients, were a perfect match. Husband, says,\"Put this one into the rotation\" High praise indeed! :) Also, it was so rich, that I think that next time I can substitute Low Cal 1000 Island, and I know he won't notice!",

Do err on the side of *more* dressing and cheese than the recipe calls for to achieve a moist result. I also used thousand-island...super tasty. It *is* an expensive recipe. I found though that the portions are awfully generous: I scaled the recipe back to 4 portions and I still fed a hungry man, myself, and had 2 giant lunches leftover. (BTW, I find it's great reheated...just make sure to reheat in the oven, not microwave so the bread doesn't get soggy).\r\n",

I like this recipe because it mimics the taste, if not the essence of a Reuben sandwich.\n\nI made this twice before posting my comments --- both times in an 11x7 casserole dish and scaling down the ingredients (e.g., 1/2 lb corned beef instead of 1 lb, etc.)\n\nTOAST YOUR BREAD! Otherwise, it will come out soggy. What I did was to cut up my bread and put it into the casserole dish, then put the dish into the oven while it was warming up.\n\nI drained, but did not rinse my sourkraut. I think that this give a bit more flavor to the dish.\n\nI used Thousand Island dressing (instead of Russian) both times. It still turned out great.\n\nEnjoy!",

I also used 1000 Island dressing, and more than 3/4 Cup -- I gave it a good drizzle over the top to lightly but evenly coat it.  The only thing I would do different would be to get the cheese right -- I thought I bought a block of swiss, but noticed while I was grating it that I had picked up sharp cheddar by mistake.  It still came out awesome, but the swiss would be even better.  Mmmmm.  My husband asked me to put this in regular menu rotation.\n\nUpdated to add:  I've made this a couple more times now, and with the swiss cheese, which was better as I expected.  This dish is a great hit with our family!",
