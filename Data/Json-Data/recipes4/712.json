Also known as green chile chutney.\r\n2) Use samosa wrappers instead of filo dough if filo is too crumbly.  These are easier to work with and do not flake so easily when cooked.  Also found at Indian/Pakistani markets.\r\n\r\nTip) I used southern style hashbrowns instead of whole potatoes.  They are already boiled and cut up, so the boiling time is much less.  Basically you are just heating up the potatoes and the peas.  Then mash together like recommended.  (Southern Style is the one that is cubed, not shreaded.)",

I lived in India during part of my childhood and Indian food is my fave ... and this recipe meets full approval and tastes so authentic!  However, like almost all cooks in this website, I modified a few things.  I diced the potatoes into little pieces and boiled them with the peas - I did not mash them. I used more cumin seeds (love the flavour of cooked cumin seeds in Indian dishes), and added 2 - 3 tablespoons of lemon juice at the end of the cooking of the filling (after the potatoes and peas were added in) - this gives it a bit of tangy flavour (a lot of vegeterian samosa recipes call for lemon juice).  I did not use phyllo dough but ready-made thin flaky pie dough - it has a very nice puff when fried and it's a very tasty combination with the filling.  Egg-roll wrappers are not for samosas and do not do samosas justice for the taste, so pls don't use them !  If ever, it's better to make your own dough, though this can be more time consuming. \nBravo and thanks again for this great recipe !",

Don\u2019t let the long list of ingredients daunt you from making this; the meat mixture is pretty easy to make once you get everything together (helps if you measure out all the spices at least a day in advance). I like to put the beef in warmed tortillas and top it with a small sprinkling of grated cheese. Yum. As for the samosa, when I first made this, I baked the samosa in the oven at 400 degrees until the dough was golden (suggested by other reviewers). I also spread the dough with melted butter before popping the samosa into the oven. And I used spring roll wrappers. Since I try not to eat too many carbohydrates, I usually omit the potatoes when making the meat mixture. It tastes just as good, in my opinion.",

For a more healthy version, bake the pastries in the oven on 400 degrees until brown and crisp. I brushed the outsides with melted butter so that they would crisp nicely. I suspect that ground turkey would be just a nice to use as well. My friends and I had fun making then and eating them :) If you are out of garlic, a tablespoon of garlic powder works well too. Also, put in a teaspoon of garam masala for wonderful flavor and a nice aroma. The phyllo dough doesn't make them like genuine samosa, though. I suggest using wonton or eggroll wrappers to mimick the doughy and thick goodness of authentic samosas. My friends and I doubled the recipe and ate them as a meal until we were stuffed. They are quite good :) Also, if you have already browned meat, just cook the onions seperately and mix them all together. I think these would be awesome with left over turkey too!",

It was great! I topped it with Cheddar and Mozzarella cheese and grilled it in the oven for 5 minutes to melt the cheese. After we each had one we made 2 more but topped each with some medium salsa. The combination of samosa filling with the salsa topping just made it a perfect meal. It was given a Yes please make this again so I will:)",
