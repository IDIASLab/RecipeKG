I remember eating this when I was about 7-8 years old. My mom would buy it for me after school. I remember the texture of the sauce (which must be the bread crumbs) however I dont remember the anchovies part. They probably just gave me a plainer version since I was little. Either way. I can not wait to try this and now I may even fly up north to get some from that same bakery! thankyou so much for posting this. Oh and one more thing. I remember parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. Is that part of the recipe?",

I spread a little olive oil in a cast iron skillet laid the dough in and pressed it to make big crusts. Baked at 500 for 10 minutes.",

Once completed, I then added the toppings from this recipe and returned to the oven to bake an addition 8 minutes.  I really enjoyed the flavors and was able to cut down on carbs.  A hit for me!!",
