Like others, I added extra seasonings to suit our tastes. I sauteed fresh mushrooms and the onions with the meat, and added three crushed garlic cloves and a tablespoon of Minor's beef broth concentrate. I also covered the casserole for the first hour, which kept it nice and moist and helped the potatoes cook properly. I then removed the lid for 15 minutes, which helped set up the dish nicely. Last, I didn't add any cheese at all, and didn't miss it. I felt that cheese would only make it greasy and heavier than I would have been able to stand. Granted, it's not gourmet, but it was created with kids in mind, after all. It was definitely something I'll make again when I feel like comfort food.",

Add minced garlic and beef broth concentrate to the liquid. If you don't have the concentrate, just use some powdered gravy mix, or something similar to jazz up.\n3. I used beefy mushroom soup.\n4. Here is the biggest tip:  Microwave the potatoes (thinly cut) for 8 minutes on high before putting into casserole. This will lessen your cooking time considerably.  Mine was done in 1 hr 10 minutes. Cook first 55 minutes with foil on, last 15 uncovered.\n\nAwesome comfort food.",

I added some garlic powder to the soup mixture to liven it up a bit, but I was overzealous and overspiced it, so I thinned it out with some extra milk and a heaping tablespoon of mayonnaise, which worked well, as there was a perfect amount of sauce. I also added about 3/4 cup each of sliced carrot and celery to the sauce. I probably put more than the recomended amount of cheese on, too; I did't measure. Another thing was the recipe didn't specify whether or not to cover; it's definately one to cover! This will go on my recipe rotation.",
