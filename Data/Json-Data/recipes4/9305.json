I couldn't find dry buttermilk powder at the store so I replaced it with plain milk powder. Also I substituted wheat germ in place of the wheat bran as wheat bran is actually less nutritous than wheat germ. Toasting the sesame seeds is definetely a must for this recipe. (And I only use brown sesame seeds instead of white.) Good bread recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "I normally make my breads by hand. I proofed the yeast in 3/4 cup of warm water along with the honey. Since I did not have any powdered buttermilk I replaced that with 3/4 cup of regular buttermilk. The total combined equaled 1 1/4 cup of liquid the recipe calls for. I used 3 T of wheat germ. I found the dough to be slighty wet so I added almost 1/3 cup of bread flour but a little at a time to the dough until it was much easier to knead and handle. I let it rise for an hour under a damp towel. I then punched it down let it rise again a while longer before placing it into a loaf pan. I baked the bread at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. The top was a nice golden brown color and I could smell a nice aroma coming the bread. I took it out from the oven to let it cool for about 20 mins. I cut a slice while it was still warm. The bread is nice and crusty on the outside and chewy. The inside of the bread is very soft light and slightly sweet but not too sweet. The bread is moist and flavorful with a subtle sweetness. The sesame definitely gives the bread a wonderful nutty flavor. The honey adds a nice slight sweetness to the bread. I think the bread could have been baked a little longer as the bread was a little doughy towards the center. The recipe doesn't indicate a baking time w/o bread machine. So next time I will bake it about 40-45 minutes. Overall the bread tasted really good. I served along with \"Sesame Pasta Chicken Salad \" also from this website.",
