I turned this into a 1 pot meal by first boiling and frying the pierogies in a large frying pan.  I removed them from the pan and set them aside. Next I added the mushrooms, onions and garlic in the same pan and sauteed until tender in some oil (did not use the 1/2 cup of butter at all).  I then dumped in everything else except the liquids.  I used chicken stock instead of beer (all I had) and mixed the Worcestershire and vinegar with the stock, and then added to the pan.  Simmered the whole mess until the cabbage was tender and most of the liquid was reduced.  Worked very well and was very good!  This would also be good with noodles instead of pierogies.",

Next time I think after pan frying the pierogies in a little butter (1 -2 tablespoons) will just set them aside instead of adding them to the mixture and just serve the mixture over them because they were a tad soggy BUT it still tasted good. Followed recipe exactly. Was a nice change. Will make again. Thanks for posting. UPDATE: Made this again. Turkey kielbasa is a nice substitute. We love the flavor is it's so much more healthier. I usually buy the Butterball brand 3 ounces is 6 grams of fat vs. 27 grams of fat for pork/beef kielbasa. And honestly it taste just as good. I also cut the butter in half. Cooked covered and set aside the pierogies. When the cabbage/sausage was done I served it over the pierogies which was way better for us that way the peirogies didn't fall apart and weren't soggy. It was great.",
