I used a personal recipe 'Cream of Anything Soup Mix' from AR to make the soup for the sauce. I used green peppers in the soup also. I had mini size pierogies and they worked perfectly in this recipe and presented nicely. I paired this with fresh cut fruit and we enjoyed a nice dinners with enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow.
