The combination of spices and herbs sounds strange, but combined to make a nice, rich, herby flavor. Used the listed amounts of all the spices, w/a few exceptions: I replaced the tbsp of garlic powder w/onion powder (since I used 2 lrg cloves of fresh garlic crushed in my garlic press). I also seemed to be out of basil & oregano, so used nearly a tbsp of Italian seasoning. Also used more than 1 cup of broth, but less than the whole can, since I was cooking 6 chops inst. of 4. I cooked on low for 8 hours -- smelled SO delicious when I got home from work, and my husband wondered what smelled so great when he got home. The sauce was great over steamed rice and the meat was tender and flavorful. Even the kids liked it. All in all, a very easy, tasty recipe -- I will make this again. Would also be good w/a small pork roast.",
