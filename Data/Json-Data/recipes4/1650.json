I didn't have prosciutto but it really needs that flavor. I added peas and it completed the meal. Think ahead and reuse the same pots to make fewer dishes!",

I saute`ed the chicken in olive oil, and added 2 minced fresh garlic cloves, 1 tablespoon dried sweet basil, and 1 teaspoon sea salt. \nFor the sauce, I used 3 1/2 cups heavy cream, and added dried sweet basil, 1/2 chicken bouillon cube, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 tablespoon real butter, and 1/2 cup chicken broth. I used a full cup Asiago cheese, and substitued bacon for the proscuitto. I also cooked the bacon, mushrooms, and fresh garlic in olive oil, rather than butter. \nMy whole family loved this recipe! If you were to add capers and a sqeeze of fresh lemon juice, it would taste just like a favorite dish at a well known Italian Restaurant....which is what I plan to do next time!",

I also added more cheese and used an entire bullion cube to the sauce to add more flavor to it. I added more garlic when cooking the prosciutto. Also I felt that there was too much pasta for the amount of chicken/mushrooms & prosciutto that the recipe called for. I used 2 lbs of chicken 1 cup of mushroom (next time I will make it 2 cups) and 1/2 cup of prosciutto. I was very excited when I saw this recipe and it reminded me of my favorite dish at the Macaroni Grill that they no longer carry. I recieved several compliments at dinner. Thank you for a great recipe!",

This was so easy and quick to make but looks and tastes like you spent hours. UPDATE: This is the second time I've made this and this time I did it with the chicken. Definitely season the chicken with garlic italian seasoning and a little salt and pepper while frying in a bit of olive oil. I still used 2 cups of mushrooms and 1 c. of peas along with a whole package of proscuitto so I doubled the sauce. I don't like a thin sauce so it was pretty easy to thicken with the cornstarch.

I marinated chicken breasts in olive oil oregano sage rosemary basil salt & pepper and then cooked the chicken on the grill. I used a whole package of prosciutto which was 3 oz. In the sauce I used 2 cups of heavy cream a whole chicken bouillion cube and 1.5 cups of grated Asiago. The extra cheese made the sauce very thick even without the cornstarch so I poured in an additional 1/2 cup of half and half to thin it some. I made the sauce in a skillet and when it was done I poured it into the large pot of drained pasta. I quickly rinsed the skillet and used it to do the olive oil garlic mushrooms and then I thinly sliced the grilled chicken breasts and added it to the skillet sautee. That only took a few minutes and I poured the whole mixture from the skillet into the large pot of pasta and sauce and used a large spoon to toss it all together. I topped it with grated parmesan and parsley when I served it and it was even better than restaurant quality. Absolutely delicious.",
