I used 1 t. salt and it was still plenty salty.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!",

They added color and flavor.  Microwave ovens can vary a lot in their wattage, and therefore it impacts the\ncooking times.  ALSO very important --- don't make the potato slices too thick!  It makes them take too long to cook.  Keep them a uniform thickness, it helps.  And stir every 5 minutes, as the recipe states.  I used only about half of the salt, as I don't like it.  Hubby loved it, too. Yummy!  : )  post by Fun2cook",

Since the potatoes were already cooked I decided to saute the onion in the butter until softened and I added the salt to that. I cut the amount of salt in half as I tend to do for most recipes. It was plenty. I added some paprika straight to the flour. I mixed it all together and poured the milk over as directed. I covered it with plastic wrap and microwaved it for 6 minutes. After 3 minutes it was still a little liquidy so I stirred in another spoonful of flour and put it back in the microwave to finish cooking. It thickened up and was creamy. To add a little more flavor I stirred in about 1/2 cup fine shredded cheddar mixed with jalepeno pepper cheese. Although it was not needed. Thanks for a quick and easy side tonight with what I had in the house.",
