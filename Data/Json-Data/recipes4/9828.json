I made exactly as stated the first time but would make the following changes next time: Cut the cabbage and saurekraut by 1/2 (I ended up with two stockpots to hold everything!) to reduce the richness use 1/2 lb of smoked butt degrease everything really well and add 2 lbs of cubed red potatoes to soak up the juices. The soup improves if you prepare it the night before and degrease the broth the next day the flavors meld together and mellow slightly making it much more enjoyable.",
