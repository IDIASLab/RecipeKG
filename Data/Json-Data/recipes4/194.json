Whether you use fresh or canned tomatoes, be sure to eliminate as much juice as you can.

It was runny, despite my chopping tomatoes at room temp, draining them in a colander and then on paper towels; but - they are tomatoes after all! Tomatoes are watery! I actually prefer more of a tomato quiche (basically tomato pie with eggs) but this was a nice alternative. I let this set up but it still kind of fell apart when sliced. I diced my tomatoes and onions (yea, I think adding onions is a MUST!), maybe next time I will do slices but I thought diced made it easier to cut and serve. Next time I will use only 4 tomatoes or 5 smaller ones; 5 tomatoes were just too much! This is best served hot, right after the cooling period. I added more basil and it was well received.

Oh, and I also add a little oregano to the spice mixture.",

I used 3/4 cup of sour cream and 3/4 of cup of mayo for my two pies.  I was afraid of the overwhelming taste of mayo that some people experienced and I'm glad I replaced some of it with sour cream.  Everyone that ate this really enjoyed it but I was not exceptionally thrilled with it.  The mayo with the mozzarella cheese was odd to me.  I really tasted the mayo even though I replaced some of it with sour cream.  I used fresh basil leaves which I left whole.  I added some minced fresh garlic.  I didn't peel the tomatoes.  I sliced them thin and layed them on a cooling rack and sprinkled both sides with salt so that they could drain.  I then patted them with a lot of paper towels.  I used probably half a roll of paper towels.  I had no problems at all with the pie being runny.  Before layering the tomatoes in the pie crust I brushed the bottoms of the pie crust with egg whites and cooked the pie crusts for about 10 minutes.  I then sprinkled some mozzarella cheese at the bottom before I started layering the tomatoes, basil, garlic and so on.  Topped with the mayo/sour cream/ mozzarella and baked for about 30 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  Waited about 30 minutes before I sliced into it.  This pie was not runny or soggy in the least.  I will probably make again but might leave out the mayo completely. Thanks for sharing ! ",
