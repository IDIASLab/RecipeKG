The wine is the perfect complement for this hummus. The only problem I had with this was that it resulted in somewhat of a thinner consistency that I'm use to, nevertheless it did not detract from the flavor. Next time I will reserve the bean liquids and add a little at a time to arrive at the right consistency. The only change I made was toasting the sesame seeds for an additional depth of flavor. Thank you sueb for this keeper.",
