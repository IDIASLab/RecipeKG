Normally when making tuna I add dill relish instead of sweet so that seemed right and my BBQ sauce of choice is loaded with celery seed to that worked too. Seems like an odd combo of ingredients but it worked for me. If I could make one suggestion I think it could use a sprinkle of cheese. I also would have preferred this with corn tortilla as in a regular hard crunchy taco shell or tostado shell but I am partial to corn over flour tortilla so maybe that is just me.",
