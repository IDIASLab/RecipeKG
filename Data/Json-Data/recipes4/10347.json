When we saw the issues with the frosting, we realized what we neglected to state in the recipe. We drain most of the juice from the strawberries into the cake, thus not having all that juice in the frosting. This way the frosting is not so runny. Sorry for the mistake... hope you continue to enjoy this. \n\nAnd to the person who said they could just eat the frosting... my brother-in-law does just that with vanilla ice cream.\n\nEnjoy!",

Which the strawberry cake mixes are just awful. Now on to my review. I am a recent graduate of culinary school in Baking and Pastry So I am used to making icings. However I paid close attention to the hints given for this icing as most said that it was to runny. I actually made this for a cake ordered for a customer who wanted it for a birthday cake. So for the icing I followed the hint and drained the strawberrys I also pureeed them through a thin strainer with an  old fashion mashed potato masher. I then drained the puree somewhat on paper towels. This did leave a need for moisture which I filled with a few tbls of both water and strawberry juice. You dont need to drain but I wanted to be able to control the amount of moisture eventually adding a few tbls of milk as well to give it a creamy texture. I believe the recipe calls for 4 3/4 cps of powder sugar. I actually used almost a 2 lb bag. which was a little over 7 cups. With the addition of the liquid it turned out great of course this made a cup or so more icing then needed. I did end up with a flat icing which is what I was looking for. If I would have omited some of the sugar and added a little more milk this would have made a very creamy homestyle frosting. The reason that I focused so much on the icing is because most people said that they coul",

The trick is to first DRAIN the strawberries in a sieve over a bowl, and SAVE the juice. Use the strawberries as directed; the frosting will not be runny. Add a little cornstarch to the saved strawberry juice, microwave until thickened to a medium gel consistency, then drizzle over the cake and refrigerate. It dresses up the cake! This works in a 9\" X 13\" pan, too.",

Everything\u2019s right this time \u2013 the texture and crumb is right, the shape is right and, most of all, the flavor is right!  They\u2019re delicious!   I used a quart bag of whole strawberries I had previously frozen.  Once they were thawed I pureed them and measured out 6 ozs.  for the cake, which turned out to be a little better than 2/3 cup.  The remaining puree I reduced (to concentrate the flavor) in a small saucepan over medium low heat.  I used a white cake mix; I like the flavor better than yellow (less cake mix-y tasting for some reason) and I also wanted a truer pink color \u2013 didn\u2019t want to try and work around the yellow. I wanted a very distinct strawberry flavor, so I also added in a teaspoon of strawberry extract.  I beat the batter TWO minutes, NOT four, following the instructions on the package.  I made this as cupcakes, and baked them 21 minutes.  For the frosting:  1/2 cup each of butter and hi-ratio shortening,  1/2 tsp. strawberry extract, a pinch of salt, 4 c. powdered sugar and enough of the reduced strawberry puree to achieve the desired consistency for piping, about  4 tablespoons.  I beat it on low speed of my stand mixer for 10 minutes.  The flavor and consistency reminded me of strawberry ice cream \u2013 just delicious.  I have to admit I was not expecting to like these cupcakes as much as I did. It was a happy surprise today.",

We concluded that the recipe should be changed to 1/2 STICK of butter....not 1/2 cup. That will make it very runny. We also used 1lb box of powdered sugar. It was pretty thick so just add strawberry juice 1 Tsp at a time to get it the consistancy that you like. Very sweet cake. I made a double layer 9 in round cake....with strawberry glaze in between the layers. On top and around the bottom I made white-chocolate dipped strawberries....it was beautiful and Yummy!!!!

                "reviewBody": "Wow (and not in a good way). I like to send my hubby w/ office treats every now & then. This time I made Vday treats. These were very appropriate due to their pretty pink color but I'm sorry to say not at all what I expected. My cupcakes didn't turn out at all! I must admit I'm not the world's best baker but I'm not a novice one either (I'm in b/t the 2). Not only were my cupcakes SUPER dry (I made 2 dozen cupcakes which I baked at 350 degrees for 20 min. as suggested on back of cake mix box) my frosting was also TOTAL failure! One VERY important note: You MUST soften your butter B4 creaming w/ your sugar & THEN add your berries. I'm not sure why I didn't do this (duh). I got so wrapped up in reading IMFLIPER's directions I didn't give it a 2nd thought. My frosting was filled w/ lumps that even my powerful KitchenAid couldn't mix. I have 2 more thoughts to share. This recipe calls for a 10 oz. bag of frozen strawberries. It doesn't mention stawberries in syrup (i.e. the sweetened variety in a container that SHOULD be drained). There was no need to drain my berries (there wasn't any juice). I suppose if I allowed my berries to thaw there may have been \"some\" juice but IMFLIPER instructs to use FROZEN berries (?). Second as is this frosting is WAAAY too sweet (my gosh)! I couldn't stomach it & have a real sweet tooth! These remind me of cheap aftificial box muffin mix w/ a sickenly too-sweet frosting. Sorry IMFLIPER. Your dad's recipe is not for me!:(",
