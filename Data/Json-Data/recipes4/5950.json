I am puzzled by the reviews that say this is bland. My husband and I like our food heavily seasoned (and spicy). Both of us were pleasantly surprised when we didn't feel the need to add chile paste, hot sauc, etc! I admittedly measured the spices generously, and I did use coconut milk instead if cream, too. In fact, I found that for the amount if spinach I used (1 lb), I needed to add almost a whole can of coconut milk to get the consistency I wanted. My Indian grocer was out of fresh fenugreek, so I used a couple tablespoons of dry fenugreek leaves, and they added a lot of flavor. I also made the paneer from scratch . . . Yum! I will definitely be using this recipe again.",

The key to making it tasty is adding hot chilli(fresh if possible)and plenty of tempered onion 2 or 3 even and lots of ginger and garlic, otherwise the dish is too bland.I have never used tumeric, it isn't required, I have never used garam masala but a little probably wouldn't hurt. Hope this is helpful.I use butter to temper the onions , I have never used cream or cocunut milk. Sorry I wouldn't dream of it, as I feel it would really ruin the taste. I don't like to tweak recipes, but I am sorry had to. But its a really good dish.",

                "reviewBody": "This turned out great! Easily as good a flavor as what I've had in many restaurants. I did make some intentional and unintentional modifications that I thought would be helpful.\n\nFENUGREEK:  I did not have fresh fenugreek or dried fenugreek so I added a couple of hefty pinches in, stirring and tasting each time.\n\nPANEER:  I read that Queso Fresco was a better option than store bought paneer if you didn't have time to make paneer from scratch.  It was the perfect consistency and flavor!  I DO have to admit my cubes became crumbles because my heat was too high.  Ooop! Lesson learned for next time.\n\nCREAM:  As at least one other user suggested, I used coconut milk instead of cream.  I used the whole can and let the moisture cook down.\n\nCOOKING TIME:  This did not take longer like others have suggested.  I believe that longer cooking times have been due to spinach not being completely drained of water.\n\nSALT AND CAYENNE:  I added a considerably smaller amount of both of these.  I didn't add salt until the end and added it to taste.  I only threw in a couple of pinches of cayenne because I knew my kids wouldn't touch it otherwise.  :)  \n\nHope this helps!  Happy cooking!",

I added an extra bunch of spinach, used a large red onion for the onion, doubled the cream, and served it with brown basmati rice. Tip 1: If you can't find fresh fenugreek (check Indian and Asian markets), substitute watercress or more spinach and either a tablespoon of maple syrup or 1 teaspoon crushed fenugreek seeds. (Fenugreek leaves look and taste a bit like watercress but with a hint of celery and maple syrup and a slight nuttiness.) Tip 2: If you can't find paneer, substitute queso blanco, queso de freir, halloumi, or another firm cheese that will hold up to pan-frying. Tip 3: Use fresh spices. I opened a fresh jar of Penzeys garam masala and used cayenne and turmeric is purchased in the last month, all in the amounts called for, and even with the extra cream and spinach, mine was plenty hot (3.8 out of 5 stars).",
