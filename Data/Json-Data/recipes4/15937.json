The favor was flat and while I appreciated the addition of fresh mushrooms since the mushrooms didn't cook with other ingredients the imparted none of the flavor. I didn't care at all for the cream cheese in this dish. The point was I'm sure was to re-create the consistency but it left the exact wrong flavor that you get from a good rue. I have tried a couple other slow-cooker recipes for stroganoff (found here at allrecipes) and would recommend one of them if you absolutely can't afford the time.",

I did slice the stew meat into little strips to be sure it was tender and cut the cream cheese into chunks and heated it in the microwave before adding it to the stroganoff. It melted in very well that way. (Cover it in the microwave as it can splatter.) Will definitely make this again.",

                "reviewBody": "I followed this recipe faithfully as stroganoff is a favorite with us and slow cooker recipes are always welcome. But the stew beef is the only element that is cooked in the slow cooker. You still have to cook the noodles and put the rest of the dish together. Stew meat is not well-suited to this dish--better to slice the beef thinly and cook it quickly over high heat while the noodles boil. The use of cream cheese especially an entire package makes for a gluey consistency as well. I think it would be far superior with thinly sliced saut\u00e9ed beef saut\u00e9ed onions and fresh mushrooms and a sauce made simply from broth and sour cream seasoned to taste. I'm not trying to be overly critical; the dish just seemed confusing and with far too many clashing ingredients and with no clear goal--taste convenience or healthiness.",
