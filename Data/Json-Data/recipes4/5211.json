I can't speak for the proportions b/c I tend not to measure anything, but the combo of ingredients is wonderful.\n\nAlso for anyone having trouble with the sauce, check out a few of the Chef John videos. They will teach you how to make a roux (which is what this sauce is), and you will never have trouble with sauces again! A good reference is the Homemade Nacho Cheese Sauce by Chef John. \n\nBtw, thanks flygal97. The spinach, onion, garlic saute was a perfect side next to a bed of rice. :)",

The reduction on the other hand was not a very good flavor and it was very gummy and goopy. I am not great at making reductions so I don't normally try. I tried making it twice and just could not get it to be good. I ate the fish with out any sauce and loved it my husband put some lemon on his. So three stars because in my opinion the fish is what matters and it was good with out the sauce.",
