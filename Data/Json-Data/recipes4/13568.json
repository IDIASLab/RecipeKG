My in-laws are from Vietnam so I have stiff competition when it comes to stir fries, but this recipe, won the family over and I plan to cook it again.  I added a bell pepper and about 2 TBSP sugar to the sauce but otherwise changed nothing. Next time I will make more sauce because it was very good, and would be great over extra rice. Tips* to make the wok extra hot, and not to make the food soggy I stir fry all my stir fry dishes one part at a time.  For example first fry up the peas, take them out and set aside, then do the mushrooms, continue until everything is complete, and then once everything is hot and crispy toss it in the wok or skillet with the sauce of your choice. I learned this from an Asian cooking show that was teaching how to make the best stir fry if you do not have a restaurant quality wok with a burning flame in your home. Since using this technique my food has improved greatly in this style of cooking. I hope it will work for you also.",

Here are my variations: Added 1 small sweet yellow onion Doubled sauce recipe(vinegar chicken broth sherry and fish sauce) Doubled corn starch/water Added 1 tsp sugar used and entire head of garlic(about 15 cloves) I prepped the ingredients first then made the sauce. I halved the jumbo shrimp(Costco fresh shrimp are awesome) and soaked them in the sauce while I was cooking the veggies. I then added the shrimp and continued cooking for about a minute then added the sauce and finally the corn startch slurry. I served this over Jasmine Rice and it was incredible. Better than any Chinese restaraunt I've ever had it at. Kudos on this great recipe.",
