Browned the dry rice a bit in some olive oil and butter, set that aside then sauted the garlic and onion and I added some green bell pepper as well. mixed the rice in w/ the veggies then added 2 c chicken broth. 1 small can of tomato sauce and a can of rotel diced tomates w/ green chilis. for a bit of extra flavor i added about 2 tsp of chili powder, .5 tsp of cumin, and salt & pepper to taste. let that simmer and Yummo!! using it as a side to my fabulous  Chicken Enchiladas with Pepper Jack Cheese Sauce.
