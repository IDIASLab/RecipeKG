You are going to have to play with the amount of broth / water you need. I needed more but we like our stuffing to start out pretty moist - then when baked is just right. I baked in a cast iron skillet - the bottom is crispy and the stuffing moist. Add celery if you like it. Also dried cranberries would be a great addition.",
