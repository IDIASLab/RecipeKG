Next time I'll make the following modifications: 1, replace \u00bc t cayenne with \u00bc t cinnamon (cinnamon is the perfect companion for sweet potatoes and pecans); 2, begin preparing and cooking the vegetables first (before cooking the quinoa); 3, add an extra tablespoon of olive oil prior to adding the mushrooms, sweet potatoes and spices; 4, five minutes into cooking the vegetables add \u00bc cup of water to the vegetables.

Here are a few tips/things I'll try next time: TIME SAVER: Microwave your sweet potato and then add it to the pot so you don't to wait 20 mins. Worked out great. KID FRIENDLY: Subtract cayenne and mushrooms add cinnamon and dried cranberries; use 1/2 an onion not a whole MONEY SAVER: Use Craisins instead of dried cranberries Enjoy!",
