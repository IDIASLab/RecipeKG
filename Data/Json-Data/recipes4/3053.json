Also, make sure to grate the onion right into the bowl so you can integrate the juice from the grated onion.  I used a generous amount of parsely instead of the mint.  I skipped dredging in flour and instead used olive oil for health purposes.  These are a hit every time!!!",

My mom made the meatballs smaller than a golf ball so the recipe made 30 for me.  I put them the oven (no flour necessary) at 350 for 25 minutes and was pleased with the results.
