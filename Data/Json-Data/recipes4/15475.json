I added the red pepper flakes as suggested - if I hadn't it would have been WAY too bland for me. So kudos to whoever suggested that! I also added bean sprouts - they added some good crunch which I like. I used sesame oil instead of peanut - will try again when I have peanut oil. Instead of rice - I used Udon noodles which was amazing with this recipe. Play around with the veg as much as you like - you won't  go wrong! oh-- I also added some garlic!",

I didn't have peanut oil so I substituted with sesame oil which gave it intense aroma and flavor. I also added broccoli carrots sweet peppers and pimento peppers (I'm from Trinidad so we get these full flavored peppers without the heat - you can use jalapenos also). I seasoned the chicken breast before adding to the oil using salt black pepper Mrs. Dash all purpose seasoning and Worcestershire sauce. (I read some reviews that said there wasn't any flavor so I made sure that mine was gonna be full of flavor). When I turned the stove off I decided to just add about a half teaspoon of home-made pepper sauce. I'm from the Caribbean so we love to add our Caribbean flair to everything! The end result was an amazing full-flavored succulent dish that I served over basmati rice. Can't wait to do it again:-)",

I had to use canola oil instead of peanut because I thought I still had oil but sadly did not and I added an extra 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and admitted the salt all together. Also I used unsalted slivered almonds that I found in the health food bulk section of our supermarket to imitate restaurant Chinese food almond chicken and I had to use a drained can of chicken noodle soup for the chicken stock as this was another ingredient I forgot to buy at the store. Amazingly with all these changes the end result was fantastic. Thanks for the wonderful recipe. awesome awesome awesome!!!",
