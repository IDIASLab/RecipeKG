I did make two changes - using apricots for the peaches and real brown sugar for the Splenda but I can't see where either substitution would have made these muffins what they were - dense chewy gritty and aside from the fruit almost flavorless. I think if I were to try this I would grind or pulverize the dry quinoa and add as flour and maybe that would help with the texture but it still needs more spice maybe more fruit and maybe even more sweetness. I won't make these again but I am inspired by this recipe to figure out a way to make it work.",

I added 1/4 of oil I haven't tried to half that with applesauce yet. I increased the brown sugar to 2/3 of a cup double what is written and I don't use soy milk so I used 1% milk. With those changes they were very good not sure about the difference that will make in fat and calorie counts but they were tasty and smooth not dense at all.",

They turned out all right they're a little dense and sticky and they are a little bland. I'm going to keep playing with the recipe.",
