I cut up the potatoes and threw them in the crockpot with the chicken broth a bunch of pepper and a can of evaporated milk. I cooked them on HIGH until an hour before dinner. I mashed them slightly with my potato masher. I did use a whole package of hickory smoked bacon cooking to crisp. When the bacon was done and out of the hot pan I fried the veggies in the bacon grease. I didn't have celery but I did have one red pepper and one yellow that I added to onion with a little garlic. After I stirred in the bacon veggies and cheese I let it warm through on LOW then turned off the crockpot so I could stir in the sour cream. Great tasting soup I was quite surprized though it was a little salty. Great with homemade bread on a rainy night. NOTE: I did not need any flour in my soup at all.",
