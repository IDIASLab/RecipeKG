I followed the recipe exactly as written except added an 8 ounce can of plain tomato sauce to the enchilada sauce to increase the amount of the sauce and to \u201ctone down\u201d the spiciness. I also added the juice from the crushed pineapple as well. I dumped the canned pineapple into a colander directly over the saucepan full of sauce. I also simmered for about 30 minutes to reduce the water but retain the flavor. I used whole wheat tortillas and extra sour cream and made about 4 fat enchiladas. I recommend laying the tortillas (like pizzas) on a clean kitchen counter to evenly distribute the filling and to keep the sizes of the enchiladas consistent before rolling them and placing them in a baking dish . They will cook more evenly and the presentation will be nicer. TY Jessie for this recipe and will make regularly.",

Here's what I did: I used the same amounts of crushed pineapple (drained of course) and enchilada sauce (although I used red chunky taco sauce because my grocery store didn't have enchilada sauce). I did use a cup of sour cream (as others suggested) added sliced black olives a can of chicken breast (I shredded it) and a can of diced green chilis. I also used a Monterey Jack and Cheddar blend in leiu of the cheddar. This dish was OUTSTANDING! Perfect for summertime! My bf was VERY skeptical about this but he just finished two enchiladas and was mmmmmmmming the whole time. Thank you!",

I thought at first the crushed pineapple would make them mushy so I used chunk pineapple (drained first). Boy oh boy did the chunks get hot in the oven! Next time I'll stick with crushed to save my scalded mouth! I doubled (at least) the sour cream and added some chopped green chiles. I think next time I'll try it with corn tortillas (personal preference) for an even better flavor. Thanks for the recipe!",

Make sure to squeeze the pineapple to get rid of most of the juice. Add 1-2 tsp. diced jalapenos and a few splashes of hot sauce to the filling mixture. Use hot enchilada sauce instead of mild. It might be beneficial to spray the pan with cooking spray first mine stuck to the bottom. Serve with a side of sour cream. Very delicious!!!",
