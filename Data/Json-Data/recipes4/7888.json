I used leftover chicken from another recipe I made from this site. I cut the recipe in half but otherwise used the ingredients called for. I changed how I cooked it however because I added my cooked chicken to the saucepan with the sauce to warm up the chicken rather than putting it in the oven. That seemed to be a better way to prepare it for us. Served over sticky rice this was a winner of a dinner for us! Thanks for this recipe!",
