It needs an additional amount of meat to match the amount of vegetables calls for. It also lacked flavor and tasted as if I didn't even add the bouillon or onion soup mix. And the broth was flat not thick and creamy. As is I won't make again. Because I had to fix the recipe by making a rue with butter flour herbs and spices and add to the broth to thicken this recipe up to what I know to be a stew. Sorry it didn't work as is.",
