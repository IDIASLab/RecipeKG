The coconut milk makes it thicker and creamy tasting like a bisque but there is no dairy in the soup. Also I used chicken stock, I love the flavor but I'm sure vegetable stock would work very well too. Can be a vegan recipe if you take out the chicken stock and use water or vegetable stock instead.",

I had about 6 cups of leftover pumpkin so I used that instead of canned and because i used extra pumpkin i used 2 cans of coconut milk I didn't add any salt otherwise i used the same amount of other ingredients as the recipe called for and it had good flavour. I'm sure using the recipe as written would be just as good.",
