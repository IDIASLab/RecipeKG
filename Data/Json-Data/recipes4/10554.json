I let the jello mixture get cold (but not jelled) before pouring it over the cake (to which I poked holes).  \nI always make cake mixes with the \"Cake Mix Extender\" recipe, which produces a higher and lighter cake.  I did the same for the Pop Cake and got fabulous results.  Here's what you do:  \nMix the cake according to box directions.  To the batter, add 1 C. flour; 3/4 C. sugar; 1/2 C. vegetable oil; and 2/3 C. water.  Mix well.  If using a 9X13 pan, bake about an extra 15 min. \nI'm headed to the kitchen to make another Pop Cake for my family.  Thanks for this recipe!",
