It ain't a real candy apple unless it has the cinnamon candy coating. The only things I would warn are that (1) This recipe will not allow you to make 12 apples. I bought very very small red delicious apples and was only able to make 5. So in order to make 10-12 consider doubling the recipe; (2) I added an additional TBSP of water than what was called for in the recip in order to stop the candies from burning so make sure to watch out for that (3) I used cinnamon disks not red hots I think the cinnamon disks give them a nice shine. You can find cinnamon in any grocery (Brach's candy to make - think of peppermints but all red and flavored like cinnamon). Otherwise this recipe is MARVELOUS and ridiculously easy though if you have never made them before I would recommend having the candy themometer on hand and just trying to gauge by the water test. Also the wax paper worked fine for me you just have to make sure they have cooled completely before trying to remove them from the wax paper.",

I thought about spraying the wax paper lightly with cooking spray, but decided not to.  I would recommend doing so in the future, as mine cooled for several hours, and the paper still came off with the apple.",

I used Honey Crisp apples and got compliments at the Halloween Potluck I took these to about how good the apples were. I used 2 bags of cinnamon disks double the water and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon extract as my cinnamon disks didn't seem to be quite fiery enough; not like red hots at least. I found that it takes some time to melt this down and before you get there they all combine into a huge piece of hard candy. It was at this point I got nervous but just keep stirring and eventually you will have everything melted. I used a candy thermometer after all was melted and turned up the heat to reach 300 degrees. When you reach the 300 degrees it will be a bubbling couldron of candy and will have expanded a bit. Turn off the stove at this time and start your dipping. You will get a gorgeous glossy candy coating that when set will be hard. With the 2 bags this yielded 7 large apples. This will be my go to recipe for candy apples!",
