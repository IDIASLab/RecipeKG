As far as changes I only had Yukon Gold potatoes so that was all I used but I'm sure it's delicious with the red-skins combined with Yukons so I'll try it that way next time. Since I made this in the middle of the last big snowstorm we had I just broiled the potatoes in my oven. I lined the broiler pan with foil and it was very easy... and as another reviewer said it gives the potatoes a great texture and helps them absorb some of the delicious dressing. Finally because we're all bacon fanatics in our house I added 4 crumbled slices and then just because I threw in about 1/4C. chopped celery and 1/4C. chopped green onion. I'm sorry! I know I shouldn't make so many changes but OMG it was really really delicious... even better than Grandma's German Potato Salad from my childhood! Again Krista many thanks!!",

First I used regular mustard instead of dijon and it turned out great with the regular yellow picnic mustard. I used all red potatoes and used organic extra virgin olive oil because I only keep that oil on hand (and use it for all baking/cooking regardless of instructions... because I dislike having a cupboard full of condiments!). I used celery seed plus a bit of salt because I don't have celery salt. I also added 2 very large cloves of garlic minced and a handful of fresh rosemary from my garden coarsely chopped. Once I cooked the potatoes I coated them with the entire mixture then transferred them to a single layer on foiled pans. Brioled in the oven until brown turning them once (broiled for about 10 minutes watching carefully). Once that was all done I cooled them then tossed with a few shakes of dried dill in the original bowl that I had mixed them in (there was about a tablespoon of the oil mixture left). Delicious!",
