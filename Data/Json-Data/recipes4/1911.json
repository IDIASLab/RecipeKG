Used chiles from the garden that have just a touch of heat (not even sure what kind they are) so I also added a couple of dashes of hot (habanero) sauce which gave the burgers just the right kick. I had about 1.5 to 2 lbs of meat so I just sort of estimated the proportions of everything else. Also omitted the ginger (didn't have & not crazy about)and reduced the cumin as per other reviewers. Served them topped with pepper jack cheese on whole wheat buns with garden-fresh corn on the cob and sauteed zucchini. SUPER yummy!",
