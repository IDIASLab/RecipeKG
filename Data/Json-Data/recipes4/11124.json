You can also use shrimp. We leave the oil out (healthier that way) and cook in this order - Combine water onions and tomato. Bring to a boil for about 5 minutes. Then add tamarind soup base pork and green beans. Cook for one hour. Add bok choy cover and reduce heat for about 10 minutes and serve over rice. An entree'? we do not need one! We love this too much to mess it up with anything on the side! We sometimes also add radishes. Sounds disgusting but it's REALLY great!",

When meat is tender to the prick of a fork I would add the Knorr packet and the tomato wedges. Boil gently for 5 minutes. Then add 2\" long bean slices (instead of string bean) and daikon (sliced 1/4\" thick half-disks). Boil gently for another 5 minutes. Add baby bok choy (bottoms trimmed off) and shrimp. Boil gentlly for last 3 minutes. This process yielded a very colorful and yummy dish! I'm Filipina and this is the first time I've made this flavorful economical and nutritious soup. Thanks to the poster and the reviewers it wasn't a disaster!",
