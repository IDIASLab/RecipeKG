I couldn't find the frozen Bacardi mix so I used 10 oz of Jose Cuervo Margarita Mix from a bottle we had and it worked just as well.  The cupcakes only took about 15 minutes to bake.  I also thought the frosting was wonderful and had just enough for the cupcakes (I don't skimp on frosting).  I think using real lime zest and juice and real lemon zest make the taste so great.  Everyone who ate them said they were the best cupcakes they ever had.  Will definitely be making these again.",

I couldn't find the frozen mix but bought a mix that already contained the tequilla and skipped the thawing stage and it worked out perfectly.  I garnished each cupcake with a lime wedge and sugar crystals and bendy straw.  It was too cute!  Thanks for an amazing recipe!  The taste was light but it was there, not overpowering.",
