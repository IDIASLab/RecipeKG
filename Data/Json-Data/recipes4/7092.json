Personally I like rice in my soups rather than pasta (although I love pasta dished) and in this soup I used pre-soaked Basmati rice in place of the pasta. I'm not one to measure ingredients, I go by the \"seat of my pants\" as my dad would have said, but stuck fairly close to the recipe otherwise. This was made with a carcass with which I made my stock and then the stock was de-boned. My brand of rice called for a 30 minute pre-soak so very little boiling was required ( 10 minutes). I ended up with about 8 cups of liquid to which I added 1-1/2t. of both beef base and chicken base and granulated garlic. Otherwise no alterations were made. You might like a touch of cayenne  or other hot pepper if you like a little heat in your soups. Overall, a very good place to start to make your own version. All  Recipes is my \"go to\" cooking site.",
