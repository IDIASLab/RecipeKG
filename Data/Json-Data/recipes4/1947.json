Due to previous reviews about it being too runny, I drained the tomatoes (I used diced tomatoes with onion, celery, and green peppers).  I omitted the pepper (my family doesn't like them), and added 4 or so cloves of sliced garlic (a must!).  I used Tony Chachere's seasoning, and only 1/2 tsp. cayenne and I thought it was perfect, but some (like my mother-in-law who is very sensitive), might find it a big spicy (nothing a little sour cream on top won't fix :D).  Finally, I planned on adding rice directly in the crock pot, but it turned out to actually be too dry (may be because it cooked for 9 1/2 hours), so I had to cook the rice separately, then stirred it in with about 1/2 cup of extra chicken broth.  So easy, and so good!",

If the \"soupiness\" bothers you, put your cooked rice in ahead of time and it will absorb liquid.  Fortunately, I am able to get andouille sausage in Houston, but I would guess that, if you only had access to kielbasa or smoked sausage, you could kick the cayenne up a notch or two and get the same result.  This stuff rocks.  Thanks for sharing it with us!!",

I am from Louisiana and know a good jambalaya so I was a bit skeptical. This turned out awesome though! I did a couple of things differently but not enough that it completely changed the recipe. I added the full can of chicken broth (didn't want to waste the little that was left), 1 can of tomato paste, 1 bay leaf, and instead of all the individual herbs/spices I just used 1.5 tablespoons of the Creole Seasoning Blend that is found on the site (I use it a lot already and it had all the same herbs and spices called for in this recipe). I let it all cook on high for about 3.5 hours. I added in the shrimp (uncooked, frozen) and 4 cups of cooked rice and let it cook for another 30 minutes. Perfect texture and consistency. Not soupy at all. I will be making it again!",
