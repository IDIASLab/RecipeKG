I then used the soaking liquid for the water called for.  What a boost of flavor! Pearl onions not a staple in my house, I simply substituted chopped, sweet onion, though shallots would me nice too, and added fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder. My only criticism is that half the amount of butter called for would have been adequate, and I am a fan of butter! I served this with Pesto Cheesy Chicken Rolls, also from this site. Update to original 4/4/08 review: For those like my husband who (go figure!)dislike it, you might want to go a little easier on the Parmesan.",

Have made it several times and I crave it. For the mushrooms I just used button mushrooms and 1/2C as the recipe called for turned out to be 3 mushrooms...not enough at all. I now make it with like 10 button mushrooms I'd even add more. I use chopped white or yellow onions instead of the pearl and I use one minced garlic clove instead of garlic powder. I also increased the wine to 2/3C I really like that wine flavor. So with those changes I now love this recipe and plan to make it a lot!",
