I added two small cans of tomato paste and equal amounts of water to it at the very end as well as 1 tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder. I also added a few extra cloves of garlic and only put in half the cayenne as I am not a fan of cayenne. Overall,  this recipe is great and for a more healthy option take out the cheese and it is still wonderful. Enjoy!!!",

Following the recipe as it was written yielded a huge colorful but bland pile. I did everything I could to liven the taste up: I doubled the onion and green pepper I took Candace's advice and added tomato paste onion powder garlic powder more fresh garlic then went on to add more (fresh) basil more oregano thyme more cumin more curry powder two different commercial spice mixes still more salt and pepper and A LOT more cheese... it's got some flavor now but it's still nothing to rave about.. Sorry Janet I really wanted to be able to give this more stars.",

I used the herbs to create a red sauce based on tomato sauce and tomatoes and mixed the mung beans into the sauce with the spices. Lastly I did not mix the cooked millet (to which I added raisins and only cooked for 25 minutes). It was great but not much like the original recipe. Sorry.",
