I made 1 small mistake by adding uncooked potato (2 small yellows cut up) Long Story. But they cooked ok but sucked some liquid from the sauce..so the pie filling as it sat thickened. But Flavor was VERY good Crust was perfect. My two pictures show the completed pie & another with the slice cut out. The sauce was thick and perfect at first cut but as it cooled it thickened. So to finish the left overs I will be making a separate sauce batch to add to it. Very Good. My veggies added were Potato carrots peas celery.",

Everyone that ate it is still been commenting about it (especially the crust) I made for a dinner on Martin Luther King Jr day and a little gathering at work for the second pie.

I had just made 2 pie crusts with shortening (different recipe) for pecan pies just 4 days earlier with the same shortening I used for the crust to this pot pie. I normally use another pie crust recipe but decided to give this one a shot since the other ones came out so well without the butter. I won't be making this crust ever again.",
