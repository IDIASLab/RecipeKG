It was way too much food, I cut the ingredients in half and put in a 9 x 13 pan, still had some leftover to freeze for an individual dinner. \n\nI used shredded mozzarella cheese instead of slices and/or cubes, and cooked the garlic with the meat to eliminate a step. Added 1 1/2 tsp salt, 4 tsp sugar, 1 tsp italian seasoning, and 1/4 tsp pepper to the sauce. I didn't have tomato puree so substituted a small can of tomato paste and 1 cup of water. I had red peppers instead of the green. I used 1# top quality Italian sausage from our local butcher shop, it made a difference since it features prominently in the overall flavor.\n\nThis was delicious. You can taste the long simmering of the sauce in the overall product. This is definitely being added to our family recipe repertoire, everyone loved it and you can feed an army!",
