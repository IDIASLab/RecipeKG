I roasted the peppers and onions before adding used two green and one red bell pepper used green olives instead of black (what I had). I also mixed in some of the cheese before topping. Used italian seasoning instead of oregano (was out of oregano). Next time will add fresh garlic and maybe some fresh herbs. Baked in a large rectangular pyrex glass dish for much less time. I also used 4 hard boiled eggs. HOW TO ROAST BELL PEPPERS: Cut around the outside of the pepper so that you have 4 or 5 large pieces of pepper. Place the pepper slices flesh side down on a foil lined baking sheet. Broil until blackened. Place in plastic bag or sealed glass container for ten minutes to steam. Remove skins and chop before adding to dish. This is a great substitute if you don't want to buy an expensive can of roasted red peppers for another recipe.",

I prefer to use small chopped mushrooms in place of the black olives and add a few red pepper flakes for some kick. Also we upped it to 3-4 eggs depending on size. I think that if you put layers of cheese in between layers of pasta (instead of just on top) before cooking the final dish has a little more structure and doesn't fall apart when you go for leftovers the next day. This is a great meal and makes a lot of food.",
