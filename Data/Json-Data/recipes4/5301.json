I am the submitter ,and  when I make it I do make it with penne pasta.something a little thicker than elbows.And that way it wont be as mushy.You also have to watch it according to how fast your crockpot cooks it.mine is done in 3 hours ,so 4 to 5 hours is a guide. And  if using \nelbows it will be done sooner.just wanted to share some tips :)",

The cooking times are off though...mine only took about 2-1/2hrs. to cook, so keep an eye on it and be sure to stir it every so often, as instructed. I halved the recipe, and used my 2qt. slow cooker, which was perfect. I used mostly Light Velveeta(R) w/ some shredded sharp cheddar added b/c I have bad luck w/ melting cheddar cheese, lol. This was perfectly thick and creamy. Oh, I don't know if this makes any difference, but I also used Barilla(R) Elbow Macaroni (the ones w/ the ridges), they worked out great in this! I can't wait to play around w/ the cheeses, spices and trying it w/o the broccoli too. Thanks for sharing this YUMMY, EASY recipe, Linda...it's a keeper! :)",

I also used fresh chopped broccoli that cooked perfectly and still stayed very green. I threw this together at 4 in the afternoon, and on HIGH this was done by 7. So for me it was 3 hours on HIGH with stirring every 1/2 hour...which I honestly didnt see a problem with...I was home...no big deal to stir every once in a while. This recipe I would not make on a work day...for this reason. My family and I very much enjoyed this! Next time I think that I will incorporate some velveeta cheese for that smoother meltier cheese, the cheddar melted fine but with a bit more of a grainy consistency...all in all a really good mac and cheese and you will be surprised that all liquids do eventually disappear. Thanks!",

After two hours of cooking and stirring I noticed the whole grain penne that I used was getting done so I took the lid off and covered the top with more shredded cheese. Thirty minutes later it was done and ready to eat. I am happy with the end result and wanted to let people know that this does work. Just for my own tastes I added a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce hot sauce and about 1 T of dried minced onion.",
