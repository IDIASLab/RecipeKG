Sometimes, you\u2019re just looking for something that\u2019s simple and falls into the category of comfort food, and that\u2019s this recipe.  We eat a lot of soup and salads/sandwiches for dinner once the weather turns warm (I live in Florida, so that\u2019s most of the time).  I had a piece of a hot chili pepper in the fridge, so I did chop that and added it to the soup pot, otherwise, followed the recipe.  This hit the spot and was exactly what I was looking for!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
