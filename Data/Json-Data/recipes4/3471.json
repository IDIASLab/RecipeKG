I was actually very pleasantly surprised & ended up eating more than I should have. I halved the recipe because I only had a 5 ounce can of tuna. I didn't use the full amount of co mushroom or sour cream, but pretty close to it. I felt the amount of onion powder was a bit much so I used a mix of onion powder, garlic powder & black pepper. I'm not a big salt eater & I thought with the canned soup it would be salty enough, but I was wishing I had mixed a bit in. I also think a dash of fresh lemon juice would be nice to set off the tang of the sour cream. These are all easy changes to suit your tastes. I am not sure I totally loved the boiled eggs in there. Next time, I might leave them out or mash them up more. I had some leftover stale garlic bread so I used that on top. Easy, peasy lunch & very filling. Thanks!",

It was almost nothing but spinach when I made it the single can of tuna in the recipe winding up completely lost beneath all the greens. I love spinach and cook with it every chance I get but I wanted a tuna casserole and this wasn't very tuna-ish at all. It also would have come out incredibly thin in a 9x13 so I did it in my favourite Corningware instead and added cooked penne. It was still alright while not being great. But the strange part was that the leftovers that were in the fridge turned into a pretty good pasta salad the next day! I'll probably keep playing with the recipe as I'm a sucker for a good spinach pasta salad and there's a winner hiding in there somewhere!",
