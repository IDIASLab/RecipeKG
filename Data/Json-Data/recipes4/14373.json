It is even better the next day, so I would recommend making it the day before you plan on serving it so that the flavors really meld. The ganache should be properly chilled in order to get the eclair texture. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and the ganache tasted great. Please don't substitute anything else for this crust, either--the crust what makes the cake taste like a true eclair. The pastry shell stays firm enough to support the filling without getting soft or soggy. I have tried other eclair cake recipes that call for graham cracker crumbs in layers and they do not have the delicious and realistic eclair taste that this recipe has. Freeze the beater(s) along with the mixing bowl and your whipped cream will form stiff peaks faster. And make sure your bowl is completely clean before attempting to whip the cream; that's why you whip it before you mix the pudding. Fold in pudding with a spatula and don't overmix and it will stay fluffy. Hope this helps!",

It poofed up like the recipe said and wasn't as eggy tasting.  It was perfect!\nThis is so delicious! My crust didn't poof up like the recipe said so I was a little worried, but it came out just fine.  It was a bit eggy; I might try it with 3 eggs instead of 4 next time.  Make sure you use heavy whipping cream (if your grocery store doesn't carry \"heavy cream\"), especially for the ganache, and it to a boil before adding it to the chocolate.  It also must sit for 1-2 minutes before whisking it together.  Otherwise it may not harden.",
