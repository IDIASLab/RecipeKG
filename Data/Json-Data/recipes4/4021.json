I've served it about 5 times in the last 3 months to different groups of friends and the compliments were endless. Definitely my most popular dish!! For the best results follow the recipe EXACTLY with ONE exception: Double the lime juice. This really takes it over the top. Use very thinly sliced meat and don't overgrill. Toast corn tortillas on an ungreased skillet. I love love love this recipe! I've made the included salsa recipe twice now and find it to be good but not as stellar as the meat recipe and maybe just a little too tedious.. The way I've come to love this dish is by making a \"relish\" (I use equal parts fresh jalape\u00f1o and white onion with a fair amount of cilantro and a few squirts of more lime juice and throw it in a food processor until it's chopped to the consistency of pickle relish). Serve a scoop of that with a few strips of meat a few sprigs of fresh cilantro leaves and a bit of hot sauce like Tapatio. That's all you need! I've tried Cojita cheese which is good just not necessary. Try it - you'll be adding this one to your recipe box for sure!",
