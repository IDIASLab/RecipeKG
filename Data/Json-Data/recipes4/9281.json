It added little chunks of tomato that added more excitement to the bread. You've gotta try this! Thanks for submitting this recipe.",

For those who don't often bake bread I recommend that instead of using the vague \"warm to the touch\" method of determining when the tomato juice and water are hot enough get out a thermometer and let it get to 110 degrees (or whatever your package of yeast recommends). Getting the temperature right is the key to a good rise. I didn't use a \"warmed bowl\" and don't see why that would matter if you get the liquid the right temperature. I might use a bit more salt next time -- I often use 2-3 teaspoons for two loves of bread.",
