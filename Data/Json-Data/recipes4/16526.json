I started cooking it a little backwards because i didn't have all of the ingredients and I needed something quick and healthy. Started with a can of diced tomatoes and added the spices listed. I used onion powder and a roasted garlic paste I had previously made and keep frozen. Added 2 very large baked sweets and a drained can of chick peas. The spices made the dish! Great flavor; hot but not overly so. I would have loved to try it over rice or have it with chicken but i had a bowl of it topped with a slightly sweetened plain Greek yogurt. This is a very versatile recipe I will come back to often! Fantastic! Thank you!",
