It takes a step of extra planning but the reward is better digestion and nutrient absorption. My personal preference is to soak with buckwheat groats and yogurt with no sweetener. I serve it with a large pat of grass-fed butter. Enjoy!",

It was very bland despite me adding sweeter ingredients. the blueberries did help the flavor a little. I wouldn't recommend, but if I were to make it again, I'd add a ton more sugar/ sweetners. maybe brown sugar and more maple syrup. Baking it made my house smell wonderful though!",

Soaking the oats didn't leave any water to drain out in the morning so it turned out to be a good moisture. There is no added sugar besides the syrup so add more if you have a sweet tooth.",
