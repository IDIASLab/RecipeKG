While browning the  beef I seasoned it with onion powder, garlic powder, freshly ground black pepper, and a smidge of salt. I chopped up one small onion, and after draining the beef I mixed the beef, cream of mushroom soup, and chopped onions together and let them simmer a bit. Then poured the mixture into a 10x10 casserole dish. I added sharp cheddar. Then put the tots on, then added triple cheddar shredded cheese on top of the tots. My family loved it including my 2 year old who typically doesn't eat beef!",

Vary the spices & it's a new casserole each time you make it.   Thanks barryzimm for bringing back one of our faves.",

I also put some cheese under the tatertots and a little on top of the tater tots. This allows them to get crispy.",
