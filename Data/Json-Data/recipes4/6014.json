Of course with any pancakes you can add chocolate chips, blueberries, etc. while cooking. It tastes great with dark chocolate chunks. Make sure you add them on top just before the bubbles all pop and before you flip them so the chocolate doesn't melt so much.",

There was just too much spice all you could taste was the spice. there was no maple flavor to be found! When I make it again I will reduce the spices by 1/2 then I believe it will be a 5 star recipe. One reviewer added vanilla and a bit of sugar...I think this would be wise to do also. We topped the pancakes with Saut\u00e9ed Apples also from this site. I think this helped cut the overwhelming flavor of the spices in the pancakes. Otherwise I don't think we would have been able to eat them.",
