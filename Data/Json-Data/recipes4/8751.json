That way I wouldn't have half a pound of sausage and ground beef left over. I also only used 8 oz of swiss cheese and I shredded it. I used whole wheat egg noodles and no one knew. It was so good. The whole family loved it. The only thing I would change would be the cooking instructions. I would cover it and cook for 30 min. and uncover it the last 5 min of cooking. My noodles got a little crunchy and dried out during the baking.",

The other 1/2 pounds of meat make great meat balls when mixed together. I also think gratted cheese is better than sliced. You do need to cover at first then bake uncovered for the last part.This is great and easy. We truly enjoyed it.",
