I used a large can of cream of mushroom soup, I browned my onions ahead of time, added more mushrooms than called for (I had and extra package) and added a bit of herb de provence seasoning to the meat.  I used pork shoulder instead of beef as well since I am not a fan of red meat.  Meat melted in your mouth after 8 hours in the slow cooker.  It was a bit runny with just these ingredients, so I also added 1/2 container of sour cream mixed with 2TB of flour, and let it simmer for about 30 mins then let it set and thicken up for another 30 mins.  Delicious!  And, like all slow cooker meals, it was even better the next day.  Definitely will make again!",
