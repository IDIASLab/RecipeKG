I wish I had scooped some batter out the second time but I made another cake in order to use up the flan batter. Cooked two hours and cooled longer and the flan almost came out right. Tasted good. My friend said to leave the cake in the water bath all afternoon even all night.",

She kept watching me and I made sure she could not see the sheet I was using to follow the steps.  Anyways, I followed the instructions and then let it sit out of the water for 30 minutes, then did the flip onto a serving plate.  Again waited 30 minutes then held my breath and slowly removed the bunt pan. Came out perfect, let it chill then had for desert with dinner.  To say the least my wife was very impressed,  and thank me in a way I can't explain here :-) :-)  Now she wants me to do again soon.",
