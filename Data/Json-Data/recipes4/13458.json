I had to half this recipe because I was making it for just my boyfriend and I. I substituted the turkey bacon for 4oz of pancetta the turkey sausage for Italian chicken sausage and fresh kale for the spinach. I did not add the pancetta or the chicken sausage to the veggies that were cooking for 45 min. After the 45min I poured in 1/4 cp of heavy cream and 3/4 cp of half-n-half mashed the potatoes with a potato masher and then used my immersion blender to make the whole thing creamy. I added 1 Tbsp of sugar (kinda to cut the cayenne b/c I used a 1/2 tsp of it) and a healthy splash of lemon juice and the chopped and cooked pancetta and chicken sausage. I let it all go for another 30 min and in the end this tasted as close to Chef Michael Chittum's Jerusalem Artichoke soup at Vermillion in Old Town Alexandria VA as a mere mortal could ever dream to come close to!",
