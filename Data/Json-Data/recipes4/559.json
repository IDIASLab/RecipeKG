I did not have self rising flour, so I put 2 cups all purpose flour in a bowl, then took out 4 tsp. and then added 3 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp salt.  You must use real mayo, not Miracle Whip.  Don't even rate the recipe if you use miracle whip, because the roll will not have much flavor. The batter will be sticky, so just use a dash of flour to help if need be. I used about 2 tbsp. of the mixture and just dropped it on the baking sheet.  They cooked in exactly 12 minutes.  So good!!!!   Thanks!",

Great with jam and butter.  \n-------------------\nHelpful hint: mix mayonnaise and flour(& baking powder and salt, if needed) together first.  I always use my hands and knead together until coarse/crumbly.  Then add milk (little by little) and with a large spoon fold liquid into mixture.  Leave lumpy - I know, I know, but it works best this way!!!  Will turn out better than the corner bakery :)\n\nAll done with mixing and baking in under 20 minutes (15, depending on oven, etc.) \n--------------\nFunny story: first time I tried this, it was for a special added touch to our normal eggs and ham.  I always make a mini \"tester\" batch to share with my husband before I try anything new for us & the kids.  Well, these were so good and done so fast, by the time he got downstairs to share... well, they were all gone!  Luckily I had already had a few more mini ones going so he really never knew (Shhh...) Haha!  \n\nWell, needless to say we made them for the kids too & our breakfast was WONDERFUL!  It's like biscuits made our usual that much more like a little cafe :)    Recipe makes perfect amount but is easy to half/double too. \n\nAnywho, hopefully this lets you know just how great and fast they really are :)\nSuper great recipe.  Will use again often & will pass along to friends and family.",
