You soak it not only to reconstitute it,  but also to rinse off some of the salt.  I recommend soaking and rinsing it twice.  \u201cNori\u201d seaweed is bits of seaweed that is pressed together to make the \u201csushi\u201d sheets. That is why when you used it,  it immediately fell apart like tissue paper.\n\nFor my taste,  I like to add a little more meat and sometimes I like to add tofu.  Don\u2019t be tempted to \u201cspice it up.\u201d   Not everything Korean is meant to be spicy.  \n\nI am 1/2 Korean and when I gave birth to my twins, my Mom made me a huge pot.  I didn't know it was tradition to make/eat seaweed soup for new Moms. Although I had had the soup a million times before, after giving birth...the soup had never tasted better.  I can\u2019t explain it, but it was like chicken noodle soup for soul. It has remained a favorite comfort food.     \n\nI asked my Mom why it was good for me , and she said\u2026in her Korean accent\u2026\u201dIt just is.\u201d",

It is dried seaweed in whole strips; it isn't easy to cut up and it leaves flakes to clean. I'd cut up the portion you want to use and put it in water. After you transfer it to pot you can cut it up with a scissor. Some variations: Add chopped/minced clams. Use some beef or chicken broth replacement for some water. (I usually do about 1/2 and 1/2 but I think some recipes use very small portions of the broth.) Add tofu. As another noted use bone marrow to boil in water instead of plain water. Use thin wedges of onion also.",

                "reviewBody": "Mmmm...excellent! a nice bowl of hot seaweed soup! When I make this I usually make a large pot because it goes so fast. I soak the seaweed in water first until it gets soft, rinse, then I use a kitchen scissors to cut up the seaweed in pieces.  I buy my seaweed in a bag from a local korean supermarket. Most times I pick up a pkg of beef soup bones (shank) and/or use bits of cut of beef. If you don't have any beef on hand you can always add beef soup stock. IN a pot with beef I add 1 garlic clove, minced, 1 tsp sesame oil, 1T lite soy sauce, to taste,  cook for one minute, stirring.  Then I add in all the seaweed, 6 cups or more of water and I let it simmer for 20 minutes. I do not add 1 tsp of table salt (too much salt) just a tiny pinch of rock salt. This soup has great flavor and is full of iron!  Other people add in cut up tofu, dried korean fish (anchovies) for stock flavor, korean chili pepper, seafood,etc.  It depends on your tastes. For a traditional korean style seaweed soup, you cannot go wrong with this recipe.. this is very tasty,healthy, comforting and a definite keeper in my recipe box. Tonight I just served this with, \"Korean BBQ Short Ribs,\" and \"Kongnamool,\" (korean veggies), from this website and hot rice. ONOlicious!",

The liquid though tastes right on! I loved it. So this recipe deserves a higher mark which it can get with a few adjustments. I dont think the recipe stated how many it served but my estimate is 3 to 4.. for 4 you probably want to add another 1 or 1.5 cups of water. For those that try to eat it with a spoon rather than chopsticks I would suggest cutting the seaweed into smaller pieces. I am told normally Koreans cut it in about 2 inch lengths which is good for chopsticks but too big for spoons. Overall I enjoyed it.",
