As I suspected this combination was too strange for me. I'm still giving it 3 stars for 2 reasons. One is that the recipe made exactly as written was edible although not enjoyable. Two is that I thought this was great with cheese substituted for the tuna which is how I ate the rest of it after the first serving. That creates a different recipe but I love the cheese version.",
