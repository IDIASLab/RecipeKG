I think you will really love this if you try it the way I did!\n\nI seasoned the chops w/ s,p, and garlic powder, then dredged in flour seasoned w/ pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and some Emrils all-purpose seasoning....&\nbrowned in olive oil.\n\nOn the stove, I boiled the water w/ one large chicken bouillon cube, then reduced, and added one can of cream of mushroom soup. I wisked together about 4 T flour in some cold water and added it to this saice. I let this simmer a little.\nPoured over chops and onions in crock pot. Right before it is finished, or even after it is done, then add 8 oz. sour cream and stir around. \nThis was tasty, creamy and great served over wide egg noodles and freshly steamed green beans sprinkled w/ lemon pepper.\nHope this review helps someone. I think the blandness some complained of will be alliviated w/ the extra seasonings in the flour mixture and the cr. of mushroom soup!! Try it!",

After they were done I again removed them from the skillet and added the sour cream and cooked for a minute. They came out so tender and the sauce was excellent! Good one Ami!!",

I used 5, two inch thick chops, seasoned with s,p,gp (salt, pepper, garlic powder), THEN I dreged them through highly seasoned flour (just use what you like).  I browned them in garlic infused oil.  I then browned the onions and put them on top of chops in crock pot.  For the sauce, I used 2 cups cx. broth, seasoned with fresh garlic, paprika, s,p,gp, and few other random things, and 1 can cream of mushroom soup.  Poured it over chops and cooked on LOW for 5 hours...could have just been 4 hours though.  Last, I added sauteed fresh mushrooms and the sour cream after moving chops to oven.  I think I should have used only 4 oz. sour cream though.  It was perfectly thick and very rich!  We loved it!",

Then I cut the onions along with some quartered mushrooms and sliced a red pepper.  I carmelized all of these in a pan with a little olive oil.  YUM.  Then I followed the directions exactly except for the end where I noticed the sauce wasn't as thick as I would like.  I had no cream of mushroom soup so I threw in some cream cheese.

I didn't have time for the slow cooker so I did everything in a skillet on top of the stove.  I used chicken broth rather than bouillon cubes, and I left out the flour.  After simmering for a while, I took off the lid and the sauce thickened up nicely without flour (and since I'm on a low carb diet, it worked better for me).  I browned one chopped onion and a can of mushrooms along with the unbreaded breakfast-style boneless chops in the skillet, drained away what little olive oil I used, then mixed the broth and sour cream along with the spices I usually use for pork chops.  After simmering for about 25 minutes, I added a splash of balsamic vinegar just to deepen the flavors.  There wasn't a drop of this sauce left, or a scrap of meat.",

I transfered chops to a glass casserole dish and put onions on each chop. Then I added the bullion/water mixture over all and baked for 30 minutes at 400. After I drained the juice and added to a small pot, stirring in the 2 tbsp of flour and cooking for 5 mins. I poured over chops and my husband thought it was delicious.
