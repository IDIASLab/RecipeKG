To mix the dough I first used a fork then my hands the rest of the way, all in the bowl.  There was no need for extra flour since I rolled between wax paper.  My dough didn't become stretchy until after it rested for 15 minutes. 1/4 inch is somewhat thick, so after cutting the circles, roll the dough out a little thinner. I sprinkled paprika over the egg whites, and baked at 350 for 35 minutes",
