I was amazed that I got 3 cups of turkey off of the carcass which I thought I had pretty well picked over. I put the carcass in a crockpot and slow cooked it all night. Make sure you add at least 12 cups of water if you want to get this many servings. I followed the recipe except I didn't have any stuffing to put it. Hubby thought it needed more zip so I added a T of Santa Fe Blend & about a half C of onion & garlic croutons.  I also upped the amount of fettucine to 8 oz. as we like lots of noodles. I broke the sticks of fettucine into 4ths, but next time I'll break them into smaller pieces as they'll be easier to eat.  Yummmmm!",
