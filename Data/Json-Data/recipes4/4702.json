Also I had an orange on it's last leg so I added the zest to the honey mixture cut it into quarters and stuffed it inside the bird along with a quartered onion and about 4 cloves of cracked garlic. This smelled wonderful while it was cooking but my only complaint was that the skin sort of burned so next time I'll keep a close eye and cover it w/ foil before it gets to that point. We all really REALLY enjoyed this and I will definately be making it again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

Keep it covered and uncover the last 20 min of baking to crisp up or use all the other ingredients in a rub and brush with honey the last 20 min of baking. For those of you who said the chicken had no taste, throw a cut up onion, fruit, garlic, herbs in the cavity of the chicken and it will permeate the meat and give it nice flavor.
