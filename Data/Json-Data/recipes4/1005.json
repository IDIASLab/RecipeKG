I not only used smoked gouda, i used jalapeno havarti & marble cheddar. The key to this recipe is to make your base of the sauce w/ the milk & butter & then keep adding whatever cheese you want to use until the sause is cheesy enough for your taste. I also added a pinch of cayenne & red pepper flakes to kick it up a little.i used probably double of what the recipe called for but I like it really smooth & cheesy, it wasn't bland, it was yummy, would totally make again!",

When I make mac and cheese I use a lot more cheese then called for and this was no exception. I used one wedge of smoked gouda and one wedge of plain gouda. While making the roux I also added garlic and onion powders, white pepper and dry mustard. Topped the dish with additional cheese and buttered panko crumbs. Awesome and thank you!",
