The only thing I disliked is that it came out of the oven very watery, I am pretty sure it was the mushrooms as they will sweat when cooking.  In the future, I would saute the mushrooms until they released all their liquid, not just 5 minutes, then add the onion until tender.  Additionally, not covering the dish with foil may help. I used cheddar cheese over the Colby-Jack, as it is a more flavorful cheese, not sure it made a difference.  Thanks!",

If you use fresh fillets they'll be cooked after the first 15 minutes so I broiled the cheese after the initial cooking time and that worked like a charm. The reason for the 4 stars - having access to fresh haddock all year around I have other recipes that are just awesome. This one is great for a quick week-day meal.",
