My husband and I like spicy food but I found this recipe as is is a little too spicy.  I only use a 1/2 of the jalape\u00f1os and cayenne pepper.   I use 2 cans of the green chilies. I wanted my chili a little thicker so I pureed one can of the white beans and only used 2 cups of chicken broth.  I also added a can of black beans and a can of corn.  And finally since the cheese adds a lot of fat, rather than mixing it all in, I just sprinkle a little on top before eating.  This is really delicious.  Everyone I serve it too raves about it.",

Per a previous review, I cut down to 2 cans of beans, and only used 1/4 tsp of cayene pepper and added some sour cream to cool it down but still...HOT! I will make again but I will eliminate the jalapeno peppers altogether (I'm not a huge fan of them anyways), cut the cumin down to 1 tsp and omit all cayenne pepper. Really, the taste is fabulous...if your not weak of tongue. I was practically sweating just eating a bowl! Still, will make again with my alterations.",

Ten bowls later I can assure you he (and everyone else) loves it! Serve with a dollop of sour cream and a scoop of salsa on top...it tastes great once it's stirred in. But be careful if you don't like hot foods or are serving to people who don't. It is considerably hot (and this is coming from someone who eats jalapenos out of the jar wasabi with a spoon and puts cayenne pepper in her green bean casserole). Cool it off with less jalapenos (replace with mild green chiles) if you need to. I also like to serve this chili over a serving of rice (sounds strange but it's really really good!).",

I did brown the cooked chicken w/ the onions, didn't have white beans, just used 1 can navy beans & 1 can dark red kidney beans, added some frozen corn and 1 can of cream of chicken. Then, since it was EXTREMELY spicy (quite a kick) and sort of thin, I added some diced potatoes to absorb some of the broth and \"kick\". My husband was getting it out of the pot before I even added the cheese, which I'm sure is just as good sprinkled on top later.  This recipe really surprised me on how it tasted like something you would get @ a pricey restaurant. It smells really good when cooking and would be an awesome soup to serve @ a party (and impress your guests). Way to go!",

SO! I used only 2 tablespoons of the jalapenos and chopped them up very finely so they would be well-distributed throughout the dish. I also used 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. This is perfect seasoning for us. I also only put in one can of chicken broth on the advice of other reviewers and I added a 4th can of beans to thicken it up a bit. Thank you Cathy! It is great!",
