Instead of topping it with bread I topped it with hashbrowns that I had already cooked in a skillet. I let the casserole bake for about 30 minutes while I was frying the hashbrowns on the stove and then I pulled the casserole out, topped it with the shredded hashbrowns and continued to bake it for about 20 more minutes. Delish! Thanks for a great recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "First off, I consider myself a pretty good cook and I'm not a beginner.  So, I followed a tip to put it in the crockpot and double it.  I had it on low all night.  I definitely wouldn't recommend the crockpot though - no browning on top and sausage and cheese layer on the bottom cooked too much.  I also used the hashbrowns just mixed in with the gravy mix - wouldn't recommend that tip either.  I think browning them on the stovetop and then putting them on top is a better idea just cooked in a casserole dish.  However, the taste was bland.  The top half didn't have enough salt and the sausage/cheese layer was WAY too salty.  Might have tasted better if it was all mixed together maybe?  I brought it to a MOPS group and only half was eaten.  Brought it home and my husband only had one helping and I had to toss the rest.  If I ever do try this again, I'll use the casserole dish like it says to and then brown the hashbrowns first before putting them on top.  I have a fantastic egg casserole recipe that we use for xmas every year and it's fantastic - I hope they post it on this site soon.  I wish I'd have made my tried and true recipe for the MOPS group!  Should have tried it on my family first!  ",

Yes definitely add hash browns, but place a single layer of  hash brown potato PATTYS on the BOTTOM!  It makes a crust.  Follow the rest of the recipe exactly except add two additional eggs and a half cup of milk when using a 13 x 9 pan.  Of course, fresh gound pepper is a must.  I make many breakfast casseroles and this is my new fav!!  Bake 50 - 60 minutes.",

Made last night and put in fridge and simply put in oven this morning. After reading the reviews I didn't use bread and I browned a bag of hashbrowns with the sausage along with one finely chopped onion. I used Jimmy Dean sage sausage. Put that in the bottom of a 9x13 pan put on a handful of cheese and then the gravy mix. Baked this morning and then added a little more cheese when almost done. Thanks for the recipe!",

The submitter of this recipe has offered what I would consider a very forgiving recipe -- I would never leave out the country gravy mix, though.\n\nI forgot the water. Didn't seem to affect it. Like most people here, I improvised with the cheese. I used 1 package of sausage, one packet of bacon, and 12 eggs. Not because I wanted to. I was tipsy. It still turned out great.\n\nNext time I will follow the recipe to a T. What drew me to it was the country gravy mix, and that, folks, is the secret to this recipe's much deserved high rating.",
