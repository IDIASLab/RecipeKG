I am a hopeless lover of cornbread which is what caught my eye. I may have been born in California but to Southern parents. I'm a Southerner at heart. When I was a kid mama and daddy would pick a bunch of salad fixin's from the garden. Then we'd each chop up our own salad of raw mustard greens lettuce green onions radishes and tomatoes and then we topped it off with hot bacon drippings dressing. I knew mixing cornbread and mustard greens this had to be awesome and it didn't fail to make me smile. Did yourself proud Donnasue. I'm goin' after more Cornbread Casserole Don't bother me...",

Having recently joined a CSA and received a huge bunch of mustard greens (which I had never even seen before much less cooked) I came in search of something to do with them that didn't require bacon grease. Well this is it!! I served this casserole like cornbread with butter slices on top and EVERYONE went back for seconds. We ate it with a vegetable soup. This will be a recipe staple.",
