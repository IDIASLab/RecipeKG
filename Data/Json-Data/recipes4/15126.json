And my hubby likes to put little to no effort into preparing and eating food. Having to cut up the stuffed pepper to eat it required a little too much effort for him. So whenever I did make them he would groan a little. So to have all the flavors of a stuffed pepper but in an easy to eat way is a huge winner for me. I followed the recipe pretty close as written. I added an extra pepper and boiled the two peppers for about 4 minutes. It was almost too long as the peppers were in the verge of being overcooked. After cooking the ground beef and onions I added a teaspoon of salt and a little garlic salt and some garlic powder. Mostly because I did not have diced tomatoes with garlic on hand. Those were the only changes I made. It was so tasty and we loved it!",
