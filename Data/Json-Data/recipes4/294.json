They really were kind of bland tasting like cream cheese mixed with salsa. I even added in a litte taco seasoning for extra flavor. After mixing it up I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours to blend the flavors. I heated my tortillas for about 30 seconds in the microwave...if you do this it helps you to get a tighter rollup which prevents the hole in the middle once they are cut. I regrigerated them overnight and then sliced. As I said they were good but they didn't quite meet my expectations. The only way I would make again is if I need a last minute appetizer as I usually have all the ingredients on hand. Otherwise I'll go with a different recipe.",

I don't know how you would fill 10 tortillas maybe if they were very small. But they did taste good in the end!",
