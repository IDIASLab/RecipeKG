The spices are strong (I would have held back a little on the thyme) but compliment the veges. Cooking the vegetables with the rice makes them mushier than I would have liked so I may not cook them much first next time. I also added fresh mushrooms and topped with parmesan cheese when served. Husband generally liked this so we will try it again.",

I didn t do that. I saut\u00e9ed the vegetables separately cooked the rice in chicken broth and then combined the two. In addition looking over the recipe told me this would be \"herb overkill\" for my tastes so I just used Penzey's Fox Point Seasoning (but any seasoning of your choice would work). This was very good with the above-mentioned modifications and I m glad I came across it to make use of the zucchini and asparagus I had in the fridge but it s still a basically flawed simple recipe for rice mixed with vegetables.",

I cut up 2 chicken breasts and cooked them in butter set that aside then cooked the veggies and added the chicken back in right before adding the spices.

I tried to make basmati wild rice but that didn't work out so well...:) (if anyone knows how to make it right I would love the help!) so I ended up making instant rice and mixing it in with the veggie/chicken mixture which was EXCELLENT.
