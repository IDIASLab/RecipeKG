Also I made the whipped cream according to another recipe: 2 cups cream after thickening add 4 Tablespoons powdered sugar and 1 tsp cream of tartar. I think this helps keep the whipped cream from going flat. Company left and the cake has now lasted four days still great! (and by the way it looks just like the picture!)",

I bought one box of cake mix and made two round cake pans but they were not tall enough to cut in half and make 4 layers so I made two. For the frosting I added cheesecake pudding mix to the whipping cream and did a second batch with chocolate mix. I made the middle layer with the two frostings and cherries. I also covered the tire top with the canned cherry filling. I made it for my sons birthday and everyone loved it. The best part is it can easily be modified to be a different kind of cake.",
