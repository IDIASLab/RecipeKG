This is what I ended up with...the pan juices alone are worth giving it a try!!...and the roast isn't too shabby either! Serve with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed green beans with slivered almonds.",

This was not difficult to make but the cook time needed much longer for my 6 lb. roast. Cooked for an hour covered then uncovered and cooked for 1.5 hours. Then let it rest for 1/2 hour. Next time I will leave it in the oven for another 30 to 45 minutes. This was by far the best tasting prime rib I have ever made! The entire house smelled awesome too. Will make again next Christmas.",
