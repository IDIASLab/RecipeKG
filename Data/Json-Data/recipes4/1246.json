Rolled 1/4 inch thick. 1 1/2 inch heart cookies took 6 minutes, 3 inch heart cookies took 8 minutes. These are sturdy enough to use in cookie bouquets. I did not add chocolate, but piped icing. Excellent flavor. They are better after several hours rather than straight out of the oven.",

I took SugarPlum's advice and increased the cocoa (by 1/4 cup) and decreased the flour by the same amount. I'm glad I did- the chocolate flavor is perfect for me. Used organic cocoa and one cup whole wheat pastry flour. Dough was a tiny bit sticky so I stuck it in the fridge for 20 minutes and rolled it out between wax paper. Cut into heart shapes and frosted with pink frosting (Decorator Frosting from this site) for Valentine's Day. I found between 7.5 -8 minutes to be the pefect baking time depending on how thick the cookies were. My babies helped me make these and LOVED it!",

But... my inexperienced friend( it was her first time making cookies) thought it was too dry and added milk...so it wasn't really a shortbread cookie in the end but it tasted great! It was a bit gooey and ever so chocolately!!! The chocolate chips didn't really melt very well and we accidentally burnt a little bit. It was more of a paste instead of something that you could dip in so we kind of spread it on like butter. It tasted really good though and it's quite easy to make. (believe me we succeeded and we are real cooking beginners. We can mess up even the simplest recipe...but man they tasted good!) Even my mom who is really health conscious and looks down on fattening treats loved these and actually complpimented us (which is rare) Soopooh and friends _",

The dough was so easy to work with and my cookies were sturdy. People who complained need a little lesson in cookie making i think. A shortbread cookie should never be rolled too thin. And I always roll cookies between 2 pieces of parchment paper then i chilled the flattened dough and cut the cookies and bake. And you really can't over bake them. As soon as the tops were no longer glistening I took them out of the oven. then i drizzled some melted chocolate over the tops. Beauty!",
