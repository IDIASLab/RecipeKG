I have taken on the tradition of making this pie every year for Easter with my family.\nWe use different meats than this recipe but this \"meat pie\" is different with every single family that still makes it.  It was known as a \"poor man's meal\" during the depression.  People used whatever they had on hand to make this and it became a very personal recipe.  Every recipe/list of ingredients are different therefore, it is TRULY a FAMILY TRADITION when we make it.\nThis Particular version is a wonderful recipe.  Myjo's version is the same as my Grandmother made.  There is nothing greater than to take a bite and feel like you are right back with family members that have since passed on.  It truly is like coming home again.\nIn my Mother's version, we use Italian ham (Ham Cappi), American Ham, Pepperoni and Salami instead of the sausage.  As I said, there are many different versions of this pie, but of all that I have tasted, I have never found one that I didn't like.  Thank you Myjo for sharing such a tradition with all of us.\nP.S., the cracked black pepper does make the difference!  We use it also.",
