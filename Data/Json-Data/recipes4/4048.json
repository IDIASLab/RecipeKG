Be careful with the salt, I used kosher salt and along with the cheese, I thought it was a little too salty,my fault. I Still loved it. We don't like our food screaming hot so I made it with 2 tbs of chopped canned jalapeno peppers. I made grilled carne asada  to go with this and wrapped the meat along with the pesto in corn tortillas. Fabulous!! Thanks again Ken!",
