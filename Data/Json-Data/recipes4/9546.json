We like ours nice and thick, so I used 3 cans of the Cream of Chicken Soup, 3 cups of chicken broth, and cut the veggies into small pieces. I made my own dumplings because I don't like the box stuff.\r\nTake 1 3/4 cups of all purpose flour, 1/2 tspn baking soda, salt,3 tablespoons of veg. shortening, and 3/4 cups of low-fat buttermilk. Add all ingredients, stir til you get the consistency of dough.  roll out dough and cut into 2 inch rectangles. Add to boiling stew and simmer for 10-15 minutes. It's really good on a cold night. It Rocks!!! Thanks Claire..I couldn't have impressed my fiance without your recipe!",

I used chicken broth, in place of the water (next time I'll use chicken stock vs broth for more flavor), added another can of cream of chicken w/herbs, 2 tsp of onion powder, 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp of garlic salt, 1 tsp of black powder and 2 tsp of poultry seasoning.  Helpful hint:  DO NOT \"drop\" your dumplings to close together ~ to cook properly they need room to breathe and the liquid needs to bubble up between them.  Better with the listed changes.  This recipe has potential, but definitely needs spicing up!",

I had made the full amount of dough and had way too much, so I made biscuits while the stew was cooking.  For those that have never made chicken and dumplings before, do not drop too much dough on the top, the liquid needs to simmer around the dumplings in order for them too cook properly.",

I ended up adding 3 chicken boullion cubes an extra can of cream of chicken soup and a can of chicken broth and it still seemed to need more \"chicken flavor\". I think I'll try to make it one more time and use a bag of frozen mixed vegetables instead of the potatoes. The dumplings came out great and you definitely have to use half the amount the recipe calls for because it makes way too many. Also I followed the Bisquick box intsructions and cooked them uncovered for 10 minutes then covered them for an addtional 10 minutes and they came out perfect. My daughter really liked it and she is usually pretty picky. The best chicken flavoring to use is L.B. Jamison's Soup Base and I guarantee it's the best base you will ever use! Do not buy the sodium free to me it's just not as good. I usually don't need to add any salt to my chicken soup recipe either.",
