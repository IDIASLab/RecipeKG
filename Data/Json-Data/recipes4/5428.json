I used two cloves of garlic and an eighth of an onion and used a hand blender to combine them 1/2 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of melted butter and 1/4 cup of Greek yogurt (in place of the sour cream). Then I added the mixture to half of the potatoes and used the hand blender on them. Instead of mixing in the other half of the potatoes, I lined the bottom of the pan with them, covered them with half the mixture, added the diced ham, covered the top with the remainder of the creamed potatoes and then cheese to cover it all.

The red potatoes give more texture while the russets give more binding power. The overall taste was superior. I used 1/2 teaspoon each of the onion and garlic powders and the sharpest cheddar cheese I could find. The flavors exploded. Gonna do this one again!",
