Awesome.\r\nI've made this dish many times now and I've learned that the cooking time of 1 hour is a bit much.\r\nI usually cook it about 30 minutes and it's fine.\r\nI sometimes do the hour but only on VERY low heat or else it gets too dry. \r\nPlus I put 2 cups of Sour cream instead of 1/2 a cup.\r\nIt just seems better that way. 1/2 a cup just didn't cut it.\r\nAlso lately I've been cutting the pork into cubes and mixing it all up and then pouring it over egg noodles. I like it better that way instead of the big pork chops. Both ways are good though",

The original Stroganoff recipe from the mid 19th Century had no mushrooms and no onions but was strips of beef filet in a mustard sauce finished with sour cream. Various chefs have tweaked that original and produced the Strganoff variants that we enjoy today. It was funny for me to eat a Stroganoff that did NOT have thin strips of meat but the whole thing works very well as a viable alternative to pork chops in a mustard sauce. I would have included some onion but was pleasantly surprised that they weren't actually required.",
