Quite the nice breakfast to wake up to, smelling all wonderful and cheery. I'll make this again. NOTE: I used a steel cut oatmeal for this recipe. Very important to know that you'll get different results if you use a different type. Next time, I'll add the nuts right before serving, so it dosen't get all cooked in with the oatmeal. I'd like a little crunch. I should clarify, I used the \"warm\" setting on my Crockpot. Mine's an old 70's version that has one of those. I didn't have any issue with mine burning. I do go to bed really late so mine probably went into the crockpot closer to midnight so mine wasn't cooking any longer than six hours.",

No one has mentioned 'steel cut oats' which are VERY different from whole oats or quick oats and likely part of the issue with those who had failures.  Additionally, you SHOULD NOT be checking it.  It's important that the water remains IN the pot not being lost to the air or a towel!  That is why you can use a lesser amount of water than what is called for on the package.  Once you put the ingredients in the slow cooker, it is a good idea to stir everything but if the instructions are followed and the ingredients are correct and the crockpot isn't faulty (and it's set on low) - this should be impossible to mess up.",
