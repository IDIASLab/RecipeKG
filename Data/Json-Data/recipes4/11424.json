I actually use more onion and spinach but instead of chopping the onion and only cooking til tender, I caramelize the sliced onions first with butter or olive oil and a pinch of sugar. Then add the spinach, omit the water, then add pecans. The sweetness of the caramelized onions works really well with the nutty flavor of pecan and the spinach absorbs both flavors. My 2 yr old and 4 yr old love to eat their spinach this way!",
