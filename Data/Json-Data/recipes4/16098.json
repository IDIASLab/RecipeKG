I sprinkled a tiny amount of salt on top of half of them before freezing the first time then coated with the dark chocolate. This added a whole new dimension to the candies. The salted caramel ones were favorites by far! There was no way to tell which you were getting so the kids enjoyed the treasure hunt! I'd definitely make these again. I'm giving 4 stars because I changed the recipe and didn't use it exactly as written.",
