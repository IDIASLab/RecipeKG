I used fresh spinach, dried thyme, canned crab, and frozen okra. We do not eat pork so I omitted the bacon and pig's tail. It was still delicious! I can only imagine what it would have been like with the authentic ingredients. I will happily make this again. I loved eating callaloo when I was in Trinidad and Tobago and am thrilled to be able to make it at home. Thank you for sharing the recipe.",
