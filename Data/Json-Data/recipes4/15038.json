And, for the onions, I stewed them in the juice separately until almost transparent, before adding in the sliced tomatoes.  This method cuts down time for me, and I enjoyed this treat.  This was a nice variation.  Thanks!",

I do think that I prefer Italian-style stewed tomatoes over these but that's just a matter of opinion also. I've never made my own stewed tomatoes so this was fun to try. Just to be clear the flavors were ok I just prefer the other version...Thanks for sharing.:)",
