I am always trying to find different recipes for the wings and this one really hit the spot. My husband grilled it instead of us broiling it. His day off he loves to grill and I wasn't going to deny him that. Next time I will probably broil it but it was really good grilled. I couldn't find the ginger and the cilantro was only grounded but it still tasted really great without them anyhow. My husband said they were fantastic and so did my daughter. This will probably be a recipe we start using more often. My husband said it was great but next time he'd add a little sriracha to his. (He likes things hotter.)",
