Authentic Gulyas is made as a soup, with meat, carrots, onions, parsley and small dough dupmplings called \"csipetke\". Of course paprika is one of the most important ingredients. Some variations are present throughout the country. Paprikas is made with onions, tomatoe, peppers, garlic, paprika and meat. You can cook potaoesin with the meat, or cook dumplings or pasta to go with it. Some people do use sour cream to make it more creamy, and if cooking with hot paprika,it also cuts the heat.
