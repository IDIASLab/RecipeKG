You can use this recipe wherever meat is called for, shape it before cooking to make nuggets or patties, and after cooking you can grind or shred the 'meat' to fit whatever the recipe calls for. This recipe has a slight chicken flavor, but if you want it to have more of a beef flavor, just add beef bouillon or soup-mix to the liquids in your broth. Seitan soaks up so much flavor, the possibilities are endless so go ahead and experiment with your favorite seasonings.",

In a separate bowl, combine the water and tamari or soy sauce. Using a sturdy spoon and working very quickly, gradually pour liquid into gluten mixture. The gluten will develop very fast and become very rubbery and elastic. If there is any remaining dry mix, quickly add a small amount of water to soak it up. Working on a flat, clean countertop, knead the dough a few times then shape into a log about the diameter of your fist. Shaping the dough can be a little tricky as it is rubbery and resistant, but just be patient. Set aside to rest for 15 minutes while making stock.\n"

I knew seitan expanded as it cooked but this absolutely exploded in size. There was already too much liquid in the dough itself. As I was needing it I squeezed out at least 1/4 cup. Then the simmering added even more liquid to the chunks. I wasn't crazy about the spongy texture once it was done cooking so I squeezed out as much liquid as I could. It came to almost 2 cups. And even though I added extra seasoning and some vegetarian chicken broth powder to both the dough and broth it was still very bland in flavor. I didn't add the kombu (not available around here) but I can't imagine that would have improved the flavor that much. I will use the seitan I made but I don't think I will make this recipe again.",
