                "reviewBody": "Got a few tips. Don't mix different greens; they have a variety of cooking times. Washing greens is VERY important. I soak for 1 hour in a large stockpot. I pull them from the water (pour on your plants) and individually rinse each leaf in running water placing each wet leaf on a large cutting board facing the same way for easier cutting. In batches I chop off the tip of the stem (hello compost pile). Then I chop the stems all up in 1/4\" slices and put in the cold skillet reserving the leaf. I use my largest cast-iron skillet that has a tight fitting lid. Bacon fat is great or olive oil but my fave is my own homemade chicken broth. I add 1/2 cup in the bottom of the skillet to stems with 4-5 minced garlic cloves cover and cook on medium heat while I am chopping up the leaves. (This lets the tougher stems and garlic tenderize a bit and flavor the broth.) I chop up all the wet leaves into bite-sized pieces toss them in the skillet (be careful it is hot!) and cover cook on low heat and set the timer for 10 minutes (because you may need more broth). Depending on your burner you may need to add more broth to this concoction to keep it moist every 10 minutes. I have eaten them after 10 minutes; I have also waited until the rest of dinner was ready after an hour (better)! Just keep 'em wet. Serving time... drizzle on Bragg's Amino Acid to kick up a salty flavor without adding sodium! For high blood pressure it's the best salt substitute EVER! Thanks rjkuns!",

I had heard about stir-frying or saut\u00e9ing greens, so when I came across this recipe, it seemed like it might be worth a try. Well, I could not be more wrong. \nI did not use a mix of greens, just collard greens. I  had more than a \"mess\" of green, probably about 3 bunches and it took way too long to saut\u00e9 them. I thought this would be a quick way to get delicious greens, but it was more work preparing greens this way than my normal way. After what seemed to be at least 45 min., maybe more, I sampled the greens. They were still tough and the stems did not cook down enough for me.  The taste was also very bland. \nI added some broth, water and additional season and boiled for at least another 45 min. Still did not like the greens. They were still tough, bland and the stems were not to my liking. I added more water and cooked for at least another hour. The same results. It does not seem as if the greens were any more tender than before I added the additional liquids. After the rave reviews, I am definitely disappointed and won't be making this dish again.",

I never thought to wilt them before and you are entirely correct that the bacon fat really complements the greens.My mustard greens were super-tender and not bitter at all. I used canola and about 5 strips of smoked bacon (not maple). I left about 2.5 strips in the pan for flavoring the liquor. I went ahead with the broth approach and differed substantially enough to make a new recipe (Come check it out!) The green's liquor takes about 2 1/2 hours to really get good. On the other hand more ready supplied liquor of the other type will allow you to bide your time waiting!",
