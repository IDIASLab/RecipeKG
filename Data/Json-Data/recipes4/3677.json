I used 8 cups of vegetable stock, powdered thyme, and about 2 tsps of parsley (no other herbs).  Definitely saute the vegetables first in a bit of olive oil and butter if you like.  The increase in flavor makes it very worth while.  I pureed about 3-4 cups of the soup which gave the soup some additional flavor and added body but still left the fun chunky pieces to eat.  This is what I would do again the next time.  If you aren't worried crazy about calories, right before you take the soup off the heat, swirl in about 2-3 tablespoons of butter which will give the soup a great sheen and flavor.  Great soup to serve with Irish Soda Bread on a cold March day.  Thank you for sharing.",
