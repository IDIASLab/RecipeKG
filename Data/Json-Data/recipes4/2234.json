I would definitely make it again because it was relatively simple for something that involved a crust and it's always nice to have a variety of ways to use up zucchini. I made it with lower-fat turkey sausage and it still tasted great. My only suggestion for improvement would be to watch your baking time. 35 minutes plus an additional fifteen minutes would have been way too long in my oven. Luckily I peeked at it 20 minutes into the cooking time and realized the top was already getting very brown so I put the tin foil on it at that point and then baked it only an additional 10 minutes. So it was 30 minutes total cooking time in my oven plus resting.",
