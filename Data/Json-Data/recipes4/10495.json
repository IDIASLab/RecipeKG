But the complaints about the dough being too sticky are simply the result of flour that has absorbed some moisture from the air.  With all pastry crusts you have to be judicious, adding half the liquid, then half of what is left, etc. until the dough has the \"right consistency.\"  I live in Oregon where it rains most of the year, so our flour may absorb extra moisture, but you can't tell how much until you are working it.  In a really dry climate you might have to add a little extra water, but with this recipe that is unlikely.  Anyway, it isn't the recipe folks; this crust is terrific!",

I put about 2/3 of the dough on the bottom and sides of the pan, prebaked for about 5 minutes so the bottom crust wouldn't be soggy, then added the pot pie filling, top it off with the top crust. I baked it at 375 for 45 minutes. My whole family was very pleased with the taste and flakiness of the crust. Will make many times! THANK YOU! ",

On the second try (too embarrassed to explain what I did on my first try) I sliced my butter thickly & froze it for about 30 minutes & then let my food processor do the work for me.

I think they are  \"never fail\" because they never fail to taste great not because they are easy.
