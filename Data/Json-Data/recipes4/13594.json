I used brown rice instead of jasmine and used the directions for the brown rice to liquid ratio for microwaves. I used 1 cup rice 2 cups light coconut milk(didnt want to waste a half can of coconut milk so i used the entire can) 1 cup water 1/4 tsp salt and 1 tsp brown sugar. All other ingredients were exact. Cooked mine for 10 mins full power then 20 mins 50% power in an uncovered 2 quart baking dish. I thought it turned out great. I was looking for Rumbi rice from the Rumbi resturant chain and this came out really close. I would say the salt and sugar is needed for this recipe but it just depends on how you like your rice.",
