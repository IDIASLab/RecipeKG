All in all easy recipe but still to me tasted of more condensed milk with almond cherry flavor(and I'm basing this off of not eating much white style fudge). The batch should be lined in a pan with a sheet of foil that has been buttered because I buttered my dish very well but it was still very hard to remove out of a pan that wasn't lined so. I normally line all my pans with foil if I'm making fudge but didn't on this instance. While I thought it tasted nice & it's flavor was rich I could see making again however the person I made them for loved it very much.",

Because I had about a cup of milk chocolate chips around I used it plus two cups of white chocolate; figured that milk chocolate is as sweet as white chocolate so it wouldn't be throwing sweetness off. Don't be tempted to add sugar! It's not disgustingly sweet like some of the recipes here and it gets more than enough from the sugar in condensed milk and these types of chocolate. Next time though I'll try it with all white chocolate just as it's written. I know that almond extract will be superior to vanilla in this recipe because it's perfect with cherries so I'll buy some of it for next time. It's fast and super-easy to make because it's not a real fudge which is tricky demanding and takes some skill. It's a tasty candy though and it's quite good enough to give to friends or take to work.",

To R&B - Regarding your question if you cut this in 8 1\" rows in each direction (7 actual cuts along each side to create 8) it should give 64 1\" pieces if you use an 8 X 8 pan.",
