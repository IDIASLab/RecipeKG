Three Foster Farms chicken breasts make enough meat for this soup. I usually buy them at Costco. Sometimes I'll add a can of Campbell's Healthy Choice Tomato Soup if I have it on hand to make it a little tomatoey. (Is that even a word?)

I tend to shy away from recipes that say \"easy \" because they are usually simple bland & not worth the tiny effort you put in making it. Exception here. Followed the recipe pretty much except I had cooked chicken already (heated & added the seasoning) peppers as listed 7 1/2oz jar italianstyle peppers (drained) 15 oz diced petite tomatoes (undrained) unseasoned black beans (mostly drained). I added leftover rice about two cups; & two ears of corn. I add any already cooked foods to soup at the end. They just need heating not cooking. For this recipe black beans rice corn tomatoes fireroasted peppers. Not much prep for a good soup; & most of us who are thinking soup really don't want to cook only eat.:) Top with shredded cheddar a dollop of sour cream & diced jalapeno. Mmmm! 2/10/13 Bag of three pepper & onion blend in the frozen foods works great! Kroger has one 12 ounces. Perfect - & a time & money-saver!",
