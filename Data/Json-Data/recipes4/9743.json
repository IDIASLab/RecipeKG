I started by sauteing the onions celery and carrots in a dab of oil before continuing to enhance their flavors. Then I added the garlic. Then the water tomato paste and beans. When the veggies had softened up I gave the soup a taste. It tasted like a watered down tomato not even the veggies added flavor. So I added a few spoonfuls of organic chicken base Italian seasoning salt pepper and red pepper flakes. I like a chunky soup and had never heard of anyone pureeing minestrone so I skipped the blending step. Then I added the pasta some more water because I could tell the pasta would soak most of the broth up and also a handful of frozen spinach. My end result was a good soup. I served it with shredded Parmesan cheese and biscuits.",
