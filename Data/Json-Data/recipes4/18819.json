The tartness of the tomato and yogurt provides such a nice contrast in flavor to the pierogis and sausage. I made this exactly as directed except I didn't have lemon pepper so I added a dash of fresh lemon juice and some black pepper instead. It was fantastic and so perfect for a cold winter night. I've made it 3x now and and it even works with hot dogs instead of sausage. Thanks SO much for the lovely recipe!",

I upped the pierogies to 20 because I didn't want to leave 5 in the bag. My sons and I all loved it. My sons are huge pierogie fans anyway. It is great with hot sauce added on top. Definitely will make it again.",
