It was so flavorful and tasty. Towards the end because I didnt have that puree thing I decided to mash it with a potato masher and then I threw 3-4 cups in the blender. As for the rest I left it alone because I did like those little bites of cauliflower in the soup. It is pretty spicy but I liked it that way. For those of you who want a little kick but not too much I would cut the cayenne down to 1/2 teaspoon. Overall Im in love. Definitely making this again sometime soon.",
