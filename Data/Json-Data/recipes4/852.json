I simmered a leftover ham bone in about two quarts of chicken stock (add water if needed) for about 30 minutes or until the meat fell off of the bone. Then I used 4 slices of regular bacon which I browned with the vegetables as the recipes instructs. I added this mixture to the soup and then tossed in the other ingredients. I added one 15 oz can of Goya small white beans a can of pinto beans and just one 15 oz can of diced tomatos. I added macaroni noodles at this time and then simmered it all for 30 minutes. I think the beans should be added at the end as the recipe instructs because they do get soft and a whitish foam cooks out of them. But even so the soup looked and tasted wonderful. Remember that canned chicken broth already has alot of salt in it so I did not add any - just pepper and parsley. It tastes even better a day later and I was able to skim off some fat after it sat in the fridge overnight.",

I was suprised by how few spices go into this soup but it's still very full of flavor any more spices would have been over kill I think. I made this according to the directions and it was great. The only change I made was in the beans I just bought two cans of white beans because i couldnt find the ones this called for but it was still great. Next time I may add some mushrooms or sausage.
