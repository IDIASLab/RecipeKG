It loses alot of juice that way, so I will use my cast iron skillet to-day. \nBut folks, please - common sense. 160-165 on an instant-read thermometer can take varying amounts of time.  If you're trying a new recipe, don't set a timer and forget about it - check on it! It's not Angela's fault you burnt your meatloaf.\n\nI'll come back around after my first skillet meatloaf over charcoal later on. \n\nOh yeah, this is the real deal. I used half pork and half 80/20 ground beef, so there was a good deal of rendered fat, which I poured off about half way through cooking.",

I followed it exactly with one exception: I used only 4.2 pounds of meat--although I did use parchment on the bottom of the skillet. Even with the reduced amount of meat in a standard 12\" iron skillet the center of my loaf was a full inch above the sides of the pan. I cannot imagine how big the skillet in the picture must be for the loaf to turn out that far below the edges of the pan. A skillet that size ain't fitting in my oven. Even with only 4.2 pounds of meat 1/4 of the loaf comfortably fed our family of five. Unless you are feeding a small army or a scout troop keep that in mind when it comes to quantity. The flavor was great although I also take issue with the cooking time. Even given the huge size of the loaf it was simply too long--I would estimate by almost 45 minutes. I had to cover the top with foil to prevent over-browning and the bottom came out with a very thin and crispy--almost burned--crust. So the flavor was was great but I would not follow this recipe too strictly unless you want to freeze half of it for another 2 meals (again for a family of 5).",
