Before anyone jumps on me for rating a recipe I did not follow exactly, the day I made this we had 40-50mph winds, so I was not about to go out to the store...I made this with what I had on hand, and it was WONDERFUL.  I plan on making it per the recipe in the future, but here goes...did not have walnuts so used pecans/almonds...used peeled, cubed, sauteed eggplant instead of the mushroom, used cream cheese thinned with a bit of heavy cream instead of the cottage cheese, and finally a cheese blend in place of the swiss.  I halved the recipe and it made 2 small loaves.  Served it with a onion gravy...WE LOVED IT!  Like I said, this is a very forgiving recipe so don't be afraid to explore some substitutions...it works!",

I also let it cool in the pan as I was in the middle of cooking many dishes. I have a feeling this recipe is pretty forgiving because it came out wonderfully.\n\nI cut about 11 slices, and it came out to 361 calories each, 13 carbs, 17 grams protein, and 27 grams fat.\n\nI will definitely make it again!",
