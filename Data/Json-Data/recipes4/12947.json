The flavor of the salsa really inhanced the stock and I didn't add anyother seasonings besides the chili powder and pepper. We thoroughly enjoyed this very much. I didn't really see that after adding the rice that it was neccessary. But you could as easily added barley brown rice or oatmeal. But I'll leave the rice out next time. TY was delish.",

(Those roasted tomatoes and peppers just add a wonderful flavor.) Instead of plain corn I used a can of cream-style corn to add some extra thickening. I added a can of cooked chicken just to give it some extra protein and texture. I added a dash of cumin to the chili powder. Finally when I sampled it I thought it was way too salty so I peeled and chopped up a large potato and threw it in to absorb some of the salt. The final result is FANTASTIC! Where I grew up you just HAD to have blackeyed peas on New Year's Day -- supposedly for good luck in the new year. The traditional Southern recipe was little more than the beans in water with ham hocks. But the family I married into does not care much for blackeyed peas so I always try to fix them some other way. THIS recipe -- with the modifications I mentioned -- is by far the very best of my efforts so far! I think I'll just call this my official New Year's Soup and make it every year from now on. And not just on New Year's Day -- this will be a delicious satisfying hot treat on any cold winter's day!",
