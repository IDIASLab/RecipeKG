I used about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips and might even use less next time. I m really glad I used unsweetened coconut because I do think they would have been way too sweet if I used sweetened. I also doubled the pecans. I will definitely make them again! In fact I need to have a few left over for cookie plates for neighbors and so I will probably be making more tomorrow Update: I made it again the very next night and they didn t turn out quite as good but they were still delicious! I think I used too much of the condensed milk on the bottom layer so the crust was too wet. Also probably didn t bake quite long enough. I do think they are better with a tablespoon or so less of the condensed milk ( the first time I made them I had some leftover because I was afraid of getting them too gooey). These issues would probably answer the complaint from other reviewers of them being too gooey.",
