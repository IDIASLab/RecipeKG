Reduce corn to 3/4 cup. I preferred to not have this recipe taste like a burrito, so I did not add any taco seasoning like some reviewers did. Instead of the taco sauce as the recipe calls for, I preferred to only add 1/2 cup of Enchalada sauce for better flavor and to steer clear of the burrito recipe. Between the green chile's and the enchalada sauce that will make the meat mixture moist enough \nwithout over doing it. I also preferred the flavor of \"Blackbean\" refried beans instead of the regular. Also I fried the chimi on each side and served it with some of the enchalada sauce on it topped with cheese, tomato, lettuce, sourcream etc. This recipe is fantastic my family really enjoyed this. \nI consider myself to be an excellent cook, and I was not disappointed at all, and I will include this recipe as one of the best I have. Try it today, you will not be disappointed!",

I make them to the point where I roll the tortilla and then I freeze the Chimichangas in individual packets. When I want to use them I take out as many as I need, microwave them until they are warm and defrosted and then spray them with Pam and bake them. I serve them on shredded iceburg lettuce with sour cream and salsa on the side.",

Also added 1 can of diced green chilis in place of the bell pepper and mixed the refried beans right in with the meat. Very easy and it tasted fantastic. I still had some meat and bean mixture left so I refrigerated it and later made appetizer chimis using soft taco size tortillas for wrapping. It just takes maybe 1T. of meat mixture to make one. They're adorable! I froze them and will use them later this month for a small party we're having. Thanks Nicole for a great recipe!!!",

I was worried they wouldn't have that nice crispy fried taste to them if baked but as long as you bake until they have a nice lightly hard touch (I had to bake them 10 min longer to achieve this ...just touch tortillas until desired doneness) they were fabulous!  Definitely take the advice of cutting the corn to 3/4C and save the rest for a side dish the next night.  I also added a can of green chile to the mix or can be used to substitute the green peppers and onions.  Also great idea to only make what you need and save the rest of only the meat mixture and freeze.  They thawed out and worked wonderfully the second time around, and saved me the trouble of having to make dinner!  I DO add at least half a package of taco seasoning, and never have taco sauce, so use enchilada.  I also agree you just need 1/2C of sauce to make these work w/o being soggy!   For a SUPER quick side dish with minimal ingredients, try the \"Best Spanish Rice\" from this site.  So easy and so good.  ...and if you have chicken to get rid of, the \"Chicken Chimichangas\" is equally fabulous. ;)",
