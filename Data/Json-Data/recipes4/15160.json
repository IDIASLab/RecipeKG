As a Roman Catholic on Ash Wednesday, I needed a meatless dish and, because I am \u201chitting the road\u201d again in a couple of days, finding ways to use the fresh produce in the fridge was a priority.  An ingredient search quickly led me to this recipe and it was a winner for me.  I didn\u2019t measure anything \u2013 the beauty of cooking is that you can use ingredients to your own tastes rather than adhere to strict measurements as is the case, for the most part, with baking.  If you want more soy sauce and oyster sauce (as I did) add a little more!  More sauce?  Add a little more cornstarch mixed with water or chicken broth.  I had mushrooms as well as broccoli to use up so I substituted the mushrooms for the indicated water chestnuts, which I really think I prefer anyway.  I tossed this with some spaghetti to which I added a good dab of butter and finished it all with a sprinkle of chopped green onion and toasted sesame seeds. It was a simple and deliciously satisfying dinner. I and my tummy are doing a happy dance.",

This is very weak on flavor and just feels like it\u2019s missing something.   To perk it up, I doubled the amount of oyster sauce and also added a tsp. of sesame oil which helped a great deal.    After reading the instructions, I felt this recipe lacked some basic cooking principles, so I chose a different route.  After saut\u00e9ing the garlic, I added the shrimp, stir-fried until cooked and transferred to a separate plate.  To avoid the risk of a clumpy sauce, I mixed up all of the sauce ingredients (including the corn starch) in a separate bowl and then added it to the wok.  When it was thick, I tossed with the steamed broccoli, shrimp, and water chestnuts.",

I used 1lb wild caught frozen shrimp powdered ginger instead of peanut oil I used olive oil and instead of chicken broth I used veggie broth. I used a store bought veggie stir fry mix instead of the fresh broccoli. I love lots of sauce in my meals so in a separate bowl I added broth with a couple spoonfuls of flour. It really thickened up everything. I will be making this for my family again! Oh before I forget I also added about 1/4tsp of cayanne pepper as I thought it was missing something just couldn't figure out what.",

I also left out the water chestnuts and I used a lobster base instead of the oyster juice. I also added in a little white pepper. I know this sounds like not even the same recipe by the time I was done but I believe it would have been just as good as written. You might say that my inventory dictates my recipes. Oh and I used fully cooked shrimp. I should have thickened my sauce before adding in the shrimp but I didn't so they got a little tough but still tasty. I will make again.",
