I had to use red and orange bell peppers because my green one was WELL past the point of use. I also only had plain tomatoes so I added some chopped garlic and Italian seasoning to make up for it. And I added mushrooms...because they were about to go the way of the green bell pepper and I couldn't stand to waste them! This was great and I intend on making it again with the green bell peppers but it's always nice to have a recipe like this in your arsenal that uses common ingredients (at least in my fridge) and comes together for a quick meal. I served it over whole wheat pasta and it was light filling and I now have leftovers for lunch! thanks!",
