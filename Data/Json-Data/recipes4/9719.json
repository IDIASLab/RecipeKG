Even doing so required a full 20 minutes to soften the potatoes, and\n\n2) Rather than throw out half of the clam juice, I added it all.  But not before I put 2 tablespoons of flour in it for thickening.  After adding, I brought it back to a boil and stirred until \"the desired thickness was acheived\"\n\nMy wife, a New England clam chowder aficionado (I prefer Manhattan-style) proclaimed it to be the best she's ever had.

I appreciate you posting this recipe as I'd never made a creamy chowder before, and needed a good, basic guideline & procedure to follow.  I cooked the chopped onions and diced bacon in a few tablespoons of melted butter, then added a couple of tablespoons of flour thus creating a roux.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe, but omitted water and substituted more clam juice instead, doubled the potatoes.  After the potatoes were cooked through in the clam juice, I reduced the heat to a low simmer, then I added twice the amount of clams (I used half minced clams and half chopped clams), and used 1 quart half & half with about a pint of heavy cream. I stirred it often making sure the cream wasn't allowed to boil.  I threw in a couple of tablespoons of dried parsely, and a couple of teaspoons of dried dill weed.  I served this at a potluck with fresh french bread, and got huge raves, and lots of recipe requests.  Thank you!!!  07/15/2012: Made this again last night...just delicious! I've found that precooking the bacon til crisp then adding to the roux of butter, onions and flour makes a huge difference.  Also, replacing all water with clam juice adds great flavor.",

I let the clams (2 cans of minced and 1 chopped) warm on the stove in a separate pot with the clam juice and water. Then I added the clams with liquid to the roux.

That will change the flavor and texture completely. Light cream and freshly ground pepper are added to the hot chowder just before adding the clams. I have never used canned clams but I'm sure they are similar to fresh. I don't trust a chowder that \"you can stand a spoon in\". I make a simiar corn chowder with chicken broth and celery when the corn is fresh and plentiful.",

This was excellent though the only changes I made were to use 3 cans of whole baby clams and to thicken it a little with some cold water/flour. Thanks for the recipe!",
