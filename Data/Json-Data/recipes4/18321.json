I did mix and match the chicken. I used 1 split breast and 3 thighs. It was kinda hairy at first but it all came together. I read all the previous comments and applied more seasoning. It was just perfect! One thing I haven\u2019t seen written anywhere is that people aren\u2019t supposed to eat the bay leaf. Not because it\u2019s poison but because it\u2019s sharp. Keep that in mind when cooking with them. Trash them after or ensure everyone knows to remove them from their bowl.",

I lost my wafer dumpling recipe in one of our relocations so I came here looking hoping I would get lucky and there was a nice person who posted one. I despise biscuit dumplings and was refusing to make them til a new wafer type recipe was found. I did make some changes to this recipe. I like my chicken and dumplings with a little more herbs and spices so I added rosemary, thyme, oregano, poultry seasoning, black pepper and some basil in small amounts into the dumpling batter before rolling it out. I forgot how much effort goes into rolling those things out! Turned out really well for me and I added a small bit of spices to the stew broth as well. Seal of approval and a you should definately make this again and often from my husband. That right there is shocking and almost unheard of as it had carrots, celery and onions in the broth. We loved this recipe and want to say thank you for posting it to the site. Definately going to be made on a regular basis here from now on.",
