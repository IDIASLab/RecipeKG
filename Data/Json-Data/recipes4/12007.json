But the lentils & rice alone are way too bland -- I added some curry garlic and a bit of lemon to the mix. The recipe was somewhat confusing - are we really supposed to spread the entire batter into a skillet and flip the whole thing when ready? That sounded very daunting; I made patties which worked just fine. Topping with a mint/yogurt sauce or chutney is a good idea - it's pretty dry otherwise. I probably won't make this for dinner again but will make a bunch to freeze - they make a great lunch. Do not attempt to make this without a food processor! Agh!",
