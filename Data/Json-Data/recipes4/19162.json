I browned the pork cubes on the stove top first deglazed the pan with some water (I didnt have any broth home so just used water) and then added to the crockpot. I also added extra garlic pepper and a couple of bay leaves to the crockpot. Cooked on high until the pork shredded about 3 1/2 hours. The ancho sauce makes a lot so would probably half it next time. Served on corn tortillas with crumbled queso cheese mexican crema cilantro citrus pickled onions thinly sliced cabbage and avocado slices. Put sliced radishes and lime wedges on the side. I think the pork would also be really good served over creamy polenta. The citrus pickled red onions and queso really added a lot to the tacos. To pickle the onions: 1 large red onion thinly sliced into half rounds. 2 Tablespoons apple cider vinegar juice of 1 lime heaping teaspoon of sugar a couple shakes of ground pepper and salt",
