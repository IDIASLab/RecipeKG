I had lots of fresh pumpkin and was able to make this from mostly what I had in my cabinets and fridge--didn't have some of the ingredients but substituted courgette for the carrot cinnamon for the cloves and I didn't have curry powder (I upped the cumin). I cut down on the time needed by baking the pumpkin pre-cooking the potatoes using tinned lentils using canned tomatoes instead of fresh and frozen thawed and drained spinach. Next time I'll be sure to have all of the correct ingredients. This is great with brown rice. Thanks for such a great recipe!",

I subbed spinach with kale and a butternut squash for the pumpkin because that's what I had on hand. It will definitely get made again on our house. It is a great recipe to fiddle with for your own needs(like what's in the fridge) but also good the way it's written. The only major change I made was to add the cooked lentils in with the kale and apple because I like my lentils to have a good texture still but a very good recipe. Thank you!",

I made this last night following the advice of others: doubled the spices added an extra apple and used 1/2c of brown/red lentils instead of 1c. I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin as suggested by the author which came out great. The only problem was the lentils turned to mush and the consistency was more like dhal. Next time I will cook the lentils for only 30 min (set aside uncovered) and then add the cooked lentils to the pot last after the potatoes are done. So essentially just combine the lentils with all the other ingredients just before serving. I served this with basmati rice.",
