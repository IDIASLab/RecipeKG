What is missing from this recipe is 2 teaspoons minced garlic and 1/2 tsp minced ginger ;-) I liked that you added cumin for a taste twist but it's really not necessary. The turmeric definitely needs to be doubled, or more to taste. Oh, and definitely reduce the oil to 1/4 cup. Oh, one more thing ... It's much easier and you'll have more control if you cook this in a large pot rather than a skillet ;-)",

The restaurants call this dish tikil gomen. I have to say this tasted almost exactly like the tikil gomen I've had before--this is probably partially because I doubled the spices (as recommended) and also used niter kibbeh, Ethiopian spiced clarified butter, instead of olive oil. (There are many various recipes for niter kibbeh online--it's really flavorful and keeps for months!) I was just looking for something to make with cabbage and potatoes, but I'm glad I found this because it inspired me to make an Ethiopian dinner with Ethiopian lentils (mesir wat). This dish turned out much better than the lentils! Definitely a keeper!",

Also, I had a wee problem with temp. as I have an electric stove. I absolutely love all ingredients in this so I'll try, try again! :0)I like my potatoes crispy on the outside and soft on the inside so next time I'll do these seperate and will add at the end. I enjoyed making it and seeing the wonderful color come to light from the Tumeric. I will keep trying! :0) ",

Reviewers said 1/2 cup oil was too much so I started with 1/4 but had to add extra.  Mine started to stick.  Maybe they used non-stick pan & I used stainless dutch oven.  I doubled all the spices as suggested except salt (1t pepper, 1t cumin, 1/2t turmeric.  Some reviews said the potatoes didn't get done so they added them at the beginning.  I did that plus I used red potatoes which cook faster.  I shredded the carrots for faster cooking too and added 2 cloves of garlic.  I cooked carrots, onions, garlic & potatoes for 5 minutes.  Added the spices & cabbage and cooked COVERED for 25 min. stirring occasionally.  It was excellent.  I put in 1/2 lb. of kielbassa toward the end but next time will serve with ham or pork chops.  That would be EXCELLENT.  Thank you for a wonderful and different recipe.",
