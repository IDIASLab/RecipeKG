I didn't have carrots and am not crazy about them anyway, so I omitted them and tossed in a can of ceci beans to compensate. I used a mix of chicken and beef broth and included more broth rather than to add the one cup water called for.  I wasn't sure I'd like the green pepper but it turned out to add a good, subtle flavor. The herb seasoning was just right. Hubs and I both enjoyed this nourishing, satisying and hearty soup. I served this with \"Parmesan Herb Bread,\" also from this site.",
