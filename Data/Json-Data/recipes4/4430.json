I halved the recipe for my boyfriend and I and made it in a smaller pan so they may have been thicker than usual but I liked them that way. Reminded me of French toast but chewier. We both decided that these would taste great done in little yorkie pans (or muffin pans) to make them individual and then stuff them with bacon or sausage. As it was this morning we topped ours with honey peanut butter and bananas (not all at once though). I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the whole thing as soon as it came out of the oven and that turned out to be a great addition. Looking forward to experimenting with this recipe!",
