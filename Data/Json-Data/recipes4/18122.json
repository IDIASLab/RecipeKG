I used lemon gas and garlic from the squeeze tube which was great. The recipe didn't specify how much curry or wine so I just went by taste. Other that that it was delicious!",

That said, I did not have lemongrass, but used lemongrass oil in the broth.  I still used 2 T. red curry paste and it was PLENTY hot; and we like our food spicy.  Didn't have coconut powder, so used toasted coconut and pounded it with mortar and pestle, to match the peanuts.  I liked the texture of leaving it mixed sizes.  Finally, we had sauce left over so we ate it over rice.  Still tasted great.  Would definitely try again.",
