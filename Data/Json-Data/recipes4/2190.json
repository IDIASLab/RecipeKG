I do not do the meringue on top... My recipe calls to chill the batter overnight then use as much confectioners sugar as necessary to roll out the sticky merigue batter and cut the star shapes... so the sugar mixes making a stiffer dough. It is very sticky and messy you will think there is no way to roll out and cut shapes add more confectioners sugar and work it in. Bake star shape exact same you could top with the meringue before baking I leave plain they are very sweet. As I said EVERYONE LOVES them. The do crack easily though.",
