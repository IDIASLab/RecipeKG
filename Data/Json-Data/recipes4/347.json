First, most fajita mixes contain MSG (some people are adverse to this, understandably) Here is a good mix recipe: 3 Tbsp. cornstarch\n2 Tbsp. chili powder\n1 Tbsp. salt\n1 Tbsp. paprika\n1 Tbsp. sugar\n2-1/2 tsp. crushed chicken bouillon cube\n1-1/2 tsp. onion powder\n1/2 tsp. garlic powder\n1/2 tsp cayenne pepper\n1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes\n1/2 tsp. cumin\nPreparation:\nCombine all of the ingredients in a small bowl. Pour into an airtight container.Makes the equivalent of 3 packets of commercial or purchased Fajita Seasoning Mix. \nAlso, to crisp a tortilla; spread tortilla with butter before baking or wet with a bit of water. Awesome recipe!",

I omitted the bacon, instead of green peppers I used green chili peppers, used green onions and made my own fajita type seasoning that was not as spicy. Used two tortillas instead of folding one, brushed lightly with butter then grilled on the griddle about 3-4 minutes per side.  Turned out perfectly browned and crispy, not dry at all.  Served with a mixture of sour cream, salsa, and guacamole.  Thanks for the initial idea.",

I've tried baking them in the oven with and without brushing with oil and/or butter, but the tortillas always come out very hard. Suggestion: Spray a frying pan with veg. oil spray and grill them at med. heat for about 4 min. on both sides -- they turn out tender and crispy. Also recommend sprinkling some cheese on the tortilla before adding the meat mixure, and then the rest of the cheese on top. This helps hold everything together.",

I didn't use the full packet of the seasoning mix because I don't think I used as much chicken as the recipe calls for. I used 8 tenderloins and half of the packet seemed to do the trick. I cooked these on my George Foreman and served them with homemade pico de gallo and guacamole.  Will definitely be a repeat.  Thanks Heather.",
