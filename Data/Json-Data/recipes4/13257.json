I only had one head of cauliflower and had to use onion instead of shallots because my store didn't have shallots.  I also used an entire bulb of garlic.  I subbed 1% milk for cream to lighten it up and added a dash of crushed red pepper and a handful of shredded cheddar (i forgot to adjust the milk for less cauli and needed to thicken it up a bit).  This is not the most visually appealing soup, but it tastes GREAT!  I will reduce the thyme a little next time per personal preference.  ",

I used 1 head of cauliflower, added 2 potatoes and 2 large carrots, added 7 large cloves of garlic and 3 shallots tossed them all in 1/4 cup EVO, layered on a roasting pan then sprinkled with ground pepper and sea salt and roasted. I upped the chicken stock to 4 and left out the water. I also added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  I used 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream. After I blended everything with a hand immersion blender I added 1/2 cup of both freshly grated Asiago & 1/2 cup of Old Cheddar and salt and pepper to taste.  Amazing.  Garnished it with fresh bacon bits, fresh chives a few pieces of roasted Cauliflower florets and a little of the grated cheese blend. and served it home made buttermilk biscuits (recipe from Allrecipes)  Great for this cold rainy fall day.",
