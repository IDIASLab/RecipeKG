        "description": "I am excited to share with you guys our cream of wheat recipe! I grew up eating cream of wheat from the box with brown sugar. It was easy and fast for the busy mornings on the go and it was more nutritious than other cereals. Cream of wheat nutrition, when you make it yourself, is easy to calculate and you know there are no artificial flavors or preservatives. It is a clean and simple breakfast. I wondered how hard it would be to make cream of wheat from scratch utilizing our whole grains. It turns out it is very simple! Top with brown sugar and fruit, if desired.",

I was not willing to risk the wheat berries in such a large quantity just in case it didn't turn out well. So glad I did! First - there is not enough liquid to cook for 30 minutes. At the 30 minute time the berries were a bit soft so I proceeded. The berries never blended they spun and spun but didn't do much else.",
