I used used 1 tbsp olive oil and 2 tbsp of balsamic vinegar instead of the balsamic vinaigrette. I also used a spring salad mix instead of spinach.

Instead of using the balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing I used Brianna s Home Style Blush Wine Vinaigrette Dressing (it s what I had at the time). It was more of a thin dressing that added a mild flavor. I also used a spring mix instead of just plain spinach and blue cheese as opposed to the suggested goat cheese. I couldn t find any candied pecans so I just lightly toasted them with a sprinkle of brown sugar and it was amazing. One thing that I do suggest is to let the chicken chill so that the greens don t get soggy. I also added some craisins to the salad for a little more taste and texture. Overall this salad was surprisingly delicious and I would make it over and over again.",

I made this using leaf lettuce feta cheese and saut\u00e9ed pecans not candied. I also threw in some blueberries in addition to the strawberries. I skipped the olive oil altogether and used Our Favorite Balsamic Vinaigrette by MATTSBELLY also on this site. Hubs grilled the chicken basting it the last few minutes with some of the balsamic dressing. After grilling I let the chicken rest for about 5 minutes sliced and placed atop the salad. This was very good and the balsamic dressing paired very well with the chicken and fruit. I d certainly make this one again.",
