Delicious and guilt-free! I used seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan cheese, with salt and pepper added for flavor. Even my picky kids loved it. I'm only sad that my husband - who swears that he's not picky - wouldn't even touch it, because he says he hates eggplant. I'm sure he'd change his mind if he gave this recipe a try!",

The eggplant browns quickly, so be prepared to watch it like a hawk.  Brown is good; black is not.  I didn't burn any, but it was close.  As other reviewers suggest, I mixed some grated parmesan cheese with bread crumbs.  When finished, make sure you give the eggplant plenty of salt.  \r\n\r\nIt was great plain, but in reading other reviews, I'm going to use spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese for a nice main course of leftovers.  I used the fried eggplant as a side dish today, but as eggplant parmesan, it will work great as a main dish.",

I found it was too greasy but who doesn't love some fat flavor, lol.  Eggplant soaks up a lot of oil in frying.  Now I preheat the oven to 400 degrees, put alum foil on the baking pans, spray the pans with olive oil, put the breaded eggplant on the pans, spray the top of the eggplant with oil and cook until fork tender.  It depends on how thick you cut the slices.  Most times 10-15 minutes will do and it still comes out nice and crispy.  You still get the flavor of frying without so much fat and this is an easier and cleaner method of oven frying eggplant.",
