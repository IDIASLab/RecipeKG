A couple of things I did differently: I wanted to make this my whole dinner, so I layed dry noodles on bottom of pan (used bigger pan) instead of cooking them separately. So that meant I needed to use 1 cup of milk instead of 1/4 for more liquid for noodles to cook. I also added a package of snap pea frozen veggy medley mix to the mixture. Worked out GREAT!",

All of these I added to the soup and milk mixture. Would suggest using fresh rosemary next time some of the sprigs were still hard. I put my chicken (8 tenderloins) in one of my pampered chef stones covered the chicken with seasoned salt then put 4 slices of colby jack on top (didn't have any swiss and I'm not a big fan of swiss anyway). Then covered with the soup mixture. Made some bertolli piccolini penne pasta and served the chicken/soup mixture over the top. Also made some mixed veggies on the side I don't prefer them but my husband mixed them into his \"casserole.\" It was very very good! Not quite enough sauce for us. Going to double up on the soup mixture next time. Will definately make again. Thanks for the great recipe it's an awesome last minute meal idea with ingredients most people have on hand.",
