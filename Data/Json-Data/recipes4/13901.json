Second with all the onions the recipe calls for it took incredibly long for it to turn golden brown. Around 45-50 minutes and that was after I turned the stove up. If I cooked it on low I would have been there all night. Third it took more than 40 minutes for the lamb to get soft even though I cut it into small pieces than chops. It was not ready in 1 hr 5 minutes. Not even close. After all that the taste was merely okay nothing special. It definitely was not worth the time and effort and I would not make this again. I'll try Madhur Jaffrey's bhuna next time.",
