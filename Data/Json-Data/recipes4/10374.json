I had lost my recipe and looked on All-Recipes and was surprised to find it, but even more surprising was that it didn't get a ton of five star ratings!  I use French vanilla instant pudding mix.  Make sure the cream cheese is soft before you try to mix with the pudding.  I make the pudding and beat the cream cheese separate then add a little cheese to the pudding at a time to make sure it doesn't get lumpy.  It is so yummy when done right. Thanks for the recipe again.  S.F.",

To save work with this, just get the Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Sheets, place one in the bottom of the pan and bake according to directions.  It's perfect and doesn't get soggy. As others have stated, I have used french vanilla and white chocolate pudding mix. Any flavor that strikes your family's fancy will do. My toddler grandkids dive in and honestly are wearing it by the time they are done! You have got to give it a try. UPDATE: I had friends for dinner and wanted serving dessert as simple as possible. I bought Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Cups, baked according to box directions. Filled with the pudding mixture, topped with the whip cream and drizzled the chocolate over all. Absolutely beautiful presentation.",

Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe. Here is a tip: When you are making the puffy pastry layer after you have mixed in the flour turn off the burner and let it cool for 10-15 minutes; then wisk in the eggs one at a time. If you leave your stove top on it will make it dry and doughy. The texture of the puffy pastry layer will be a thick stretchy liquid. IT SHOULD NOT BE DOUGHY AFTER EGGS ARE ADDED. Pour on very greased cookie sheet and spread with spoon. After baked it will be poofy and ridges; similar to german pancakes. This recipe is sooooo good!",
