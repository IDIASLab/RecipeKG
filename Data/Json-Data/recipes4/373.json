Very simple ingredients that produce a yummy waffle.  I did add about 2-3 T sugar and about 2-3 t vanilla to sweeten it up a bit.  I also added about 1 -1 1/2 cups frozen blueberries.  My daughter and her friend loved them.  This recipe does make more than 4 servings in my opinion.  I got about 7 6 in round waffles out of it and they are very filling.",

I made as directed except used others recommendations and added 2 Tbsp. of sugar (don't like mine too sweet especially since I'm using pure maple syrup on top) 1 tsp. cinnamon and 2 tsp. vanilla. In place of the milk I used 1/2 buttermilk and 1/2 regular milk. They cooked up nice and light not thick and chewy like the waffles I usually make. I was able to get approximately 7 - 7\" waffles plenty to freeze the extras. Thanks for a great recipe Karen! (BTW be sure to give your waffle maker a quick spray of oil before pouring each waffle).",
