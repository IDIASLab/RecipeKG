I'm not a fan of cream cheese so I used provolone for me (and American for Mr. LTH). I used 12 grain bread for mine (and pumpernickel for Mr. LTH). Outstanding! I've been on a ham pineapple and onion pizza kick so this was a much more figure friendly way to feed that craving (and I'll add some onion next time too!). THANKS for a great recipe!",
