In addition I rarely use my Crock-Pot and was in the mood to. This recipe called out to me and I SO looked forward to making it! It was wonderfully aromatic as it was cooking and the finished dish didn t disappoint. However I did play with the recipe some. Rather than the proportions directed in the recipe I used half tomato sauce half hoisin sauce. I added a good glug of mirin (rice wine) a few shakes of soy sauce and some minced garlic. I found I only needed half the amount of sauce called for. If I was to make this again I would use only half the recipe of sauce for the same amount of ribs it was plenty. Just as was the aroma as this was cooking the flavor was equally as tantalizing. I served this with Stir Fried Sesame Vegetables with Rice also from this site and garnished it with some chopped green onion and toasted sesame seeds. To complete the meal I accompanied it with Chinese-Style Broccoli Salad. It was a beautiful and colorful presentation nutritious and wholesome and deliciously satisfying. Five stars for sure with the modifications - especially the addition of the soy sauce and mirin.",

I cooked them on high for 4 hours and the bones we're falling out. I love the ease of this recipe and the short list of ingredients. I would suggest trying a whole onion adding garlic and some sriracha for some heat. A good side in my opinion would be quinoa sticky rice or a steamed/grilled veggie.",

                "reviewBody": "I made this over night 9PM - 6AM. This morning I woke up to a very aromatic home. This is a super easy & tasty recipe. I used 2.6 lbs of country style ribs (on sale 1.79/lb) & adjusted the recipe accordingly. Prior to browning the ribs I cut off much of the fat but left enough for flavor. Then I browned the ribs in olive oil about 2-3 minutes total. I used olive oil only because I have it in the house & didn t want to buy peanut oil that I know I ll hardly ever use; not sure if it really makes a difference. I couldn t find shitake mushrooms so just bought a 4 oz can for slice mushrooms; not sure if that makes a difference either. Also used 1 Tbs dried minced onion. I incorporated the suggestions of reviewer \"naples34102\"' & used low sodium rice wine low sodium soy sauce & fresh garlic clove that I minced. I agree with naples34102's comment about the sauce; all in all it's really a personal preference. Instead of 15 oz can tomato sauce I used 6 oz of store bought jarred garlic & basil marinara that I had in my fridge & 8 oz hoisin sauce. Looking forward to enjoying it tonight for dinner! Of course I did bring a bit to the office as a lunch appetizer! For those living in Boston s north shore it will cost you about 11 - 12 to make this recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "Good as is though I suggest removing the meat from the pan and browning a diced onion to make use of the browned bits left from sauteing. Then if you want to you can deglaze with a bit (I think I used about 1/2 a cup maybe less-kind of depends on the width of your pan) of mirin and pour into the crock pot with the rest of the ingredients. You can skip this as the pork contains some salt usually and will both brown and deglaze the onion but the mirin will help with caramelization. All of this takes only a few more seconds and deepens the flavour dramatically. Some chili paste made mine a little more fun too. Definitely sprinkle toasted sesame seeds over them. I added a couple drops of toasted sesame oil to the pot because if I could I would drink the stuff straight from the bottle.",
