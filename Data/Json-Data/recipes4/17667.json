(Turns out the equivalent should have been 4 cans!) Because of my accidental omission the patties were a bit sticky to work with but then they cooked up beautifully. We ate with tomato slices and avocado slices. If you like it spicy add a little bit of hot sauce after or cayenne (sparingly) while mixing the ingredients together. Also great with a dollop of plain Greek yogurt and a squeeze of lemon juice. Delighted and can't wait to try again!",

Some clarifications in directions would be helpful, such as: how many cups of cooked chickpeas do you get from the dried chickpeas? do you drain the chickpeas before adding? Maybe because I didn't drain aggressively, but my mixture was very, very wet, and I added about 3/4 cup of panko crumbs to help it to hold together. With this addition, it had a wonderful texture and held together in very wide patties while I pan fried them and ate them. It has a definite falafel vibe going on, so I served with a sort of garlic mayo-tzatziki sauce that I made up. Yum!",
