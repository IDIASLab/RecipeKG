What a hit! Make a glaze and use some fun sprinkles on top. I have since used this idea to make a \"Santa Vomit Cake\" for Christmas using plain batter red and green. What a great idea this is..... You can use different colors for different holidays...... Red White and Blue would be great for the 4th of July. Thanks for such and neat idea (P.S. when you color your batter you can just \"plop\" it in the pan. It will marble while it bakes!)",

We used pink green blue orange yellow and purple for the cake and neon green blue for the frosting. I also bought colored sugar (we made this into cupcakes) and topped each one with the different colors. They turned out amazingly bright and everyone loved them. My sister actually wants me to make a cake like this for her birthday. If you make cup cakes just pour about 2 cups of the batter into 6 different bowls and add the gel coloring.. blend together and dump a tablespoon of each color into the cups. Two boxes made 34 cupcakes.. half of which were gone 30 minutes into our celebration.",

We layered the colored cake batter into muffin pans to make cupcakes and did not swirl the batter. To make layering easier I put the batter into sandwich baggies and piped it into the pan. I really thought the colors were going to be dull but was pleasantly surprised at how bright they turned out after baking. I frosted my cupcakes with Fluffy White Frosting from this site.

The colors were wonderful and the marbled effect was really neat but the second it was finished this funny smell washed over the room. My 4 year old son asked \"Why did you make a cake out of playdough mommy?!?\" and sure enough after a quick testing not only did it smell like playdough - it also tasted like playdough.... ew. Any suggestions as to what I might have down wrong?!?! I used a Duncan Hines white cake mix box and....oh.... I used vegitable oil instead of canola. Do you think that would have made a difference? Either way I'm dissapointed because after all that planning and preparation.... I'll be buying a store bought cake for my husbands birthday tonight.:(",
