They were very juicy and flavorful and they were plenty enough salty from the bouillon alone (I think they would have been much too salty with the extra 2 tsp. salt).  At the end of cooking time I removed the chops from the pan and thickened the juices with 3 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 3 tablespoons cold water and it made a nice, thick, brown gravy that had a very good flavor.  I served the chops and gravy with mashed potatoes and broccoli spears.  This was a delicious, easy meal that I would definitely make again!",

The 3rd time I made them, I used 1 tsp salt instead of two, 1 tsp of sage PER chop (i like sage,can ya tell?)   beef broth, 4 whole cloves of fresh garlic and I cut up 1 medium yellow onion. I took other users advice and thickend it up with 3 tbs corn starch and 3 tbs cold water. Came out awesome! Thanks!\nEdit* After going back after several months and reading reviews after I made this one, I would recommend timing your cooking to the thickness of the chops. It seems the thinner ones will dry out and you might need to cut back on the frying/cooking time, Just a suggestion!",

I recommend browning for 3 minutes per side then cooking on the low setting for 15 or 20 minutes. Check the inside of the meat at that point. 45 minutes cook time seems completely unreasonable unless the chops are super thick or you prefer them dry as the desert. I did not like the overwhelming sage flavor which comes across better as a more subtle flavor in most meats I think. After reading the reviews I didn't use any salt at first but then added 1/2 teaspoon or so after tasting. I doubled the water and bouillon mixture because I needed more gravy. I added 2 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon corn starch to thicken the gravy after removing the meat. The gravy was wonderful but I will not prepare the meat again without reducing the cook times and sage.",
