I thought I would try to give him a little touch of his father who was not able to be with us for Thanksgiving.  He commented that these were better than his fathers.  Kootos to SouthernGirl3!  The only thing I did different was put the liquid in a crock pot on low the night before with the ham hock.   It made the meat so tender and you really get a lot of extra flavoring.  Other than that, my recommendation is to make extra because they were so good.\r\n\r\n",

First, wash your ham hocks off and put them in a pot, cover with water, bring to a boil and cook over medium heat for about fifteen minutes and pour the water off.  Then, start a fresh pot with water to cover and cook until almost tender, but not quite done.  It could take as long as three hours.  It depends on your cookware, your fire, etc..  You can boil them on high heat, but watch them and add water if necessary. Then, when they're almost tender, but not too tender, add your remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.  You won't need too much salt and I always use crushed red pepper, a white or yellow onion, quartered, a few cloves of garlic, chopped and even some cajun seasoning.  Simmer about an hour, or until the greens are the way you like them.  Some people like them chewy, so take a few out after about 45 minutes and taste them for tenderness.  These steps are necessary to keep from having your greens too salty or overcooking them.  Serve with vinegar and hot sauce, like Louisiana Hot Sauce. Yummy!",
