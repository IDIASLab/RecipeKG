I cooked all this for 10 minutes, cooled it down and added the potatoes and some green peas. I then cooked it for another 10 minutes.

The ultimate fast food when rich, hearty beef stew takes only 30 minutes from beginning to end!  I use a similar basic recipe such as this, but add a TBS of tomato paste to the beef broth base.  I don't use bouillian because of the salt factor.  I don't bother to parboil potatoes and add the carrots and taters at the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Comes out perfect every time.  If you par boil the potatoes it removes the \"stick to your ribs\" factor that's so devine about stew!  Try the School Lunchroom Rolls recipe on this website with this stew.  VERY nice together and oh, such sweet memories!",

I dredged the meat in flour with spices, then browned it, removed it, and fried an onion, plus a bell pepper and some garlic.  I threw in a carrot, the meat, water, a bit of Worcestershire, and bouillon, then cooked under pressure for 10 minutes.  The carrots were already done at that point, so next time I'll throw them in with the potatoes.  After the ten minutes, I added 4 potatoes, 1 big sweet potato, a large zucchini, and a bit more water and cooked under pressure for another ten minutes.  Finally, I removed some of the liquid and mixed it with some corn starch to thicken.  I served it with homemade whole wheat bread, and it was a hit.  Thanks for a simple, adaptable recipe!",
