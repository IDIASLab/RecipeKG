I didn't use the ground lamb but used a lot of meaty bones and a leftover leg bone that I had frozen from a prior dinner. I used the same basic spices and this turned out great. What I did with the bones was to cover with water and simmer for a few hours with a large diced onion and an envelope of onion soup mix and a few bay leaves. (I didn't have the beef consomme or even an oxo cube so thought this would add the necessary salt and flavour). I then strained the whole thing picked any meat off the bones and added the diced tomatoes can of tomato soup and chili powder and doubled the barely called for. Turned on a very low simmer for a few more hours got home from shopping and added a couple of handfuls of frozen mixed vegetables and some fresh celery and in about a half hour sat down to a very lovely soup for lunch. I also got several containers for the freezer. Thanks for the great ideas. Wouldn't have thought to mix the chili powder in this soup. I think it made for a nice little added zing.",

IT DOESNT NEED IT!!delicious. i had ground lamb and ahve never eaten it much less cooked it. we found exactly one pound for sale one day and decided to buy it. i didnt know what to do with it and i looked on here. the first thing that popped up (after you click on rating) was this. not one person including me has rated this less than 5 stars. i just realized we had barley the other day in our cabinet and had also never cooked THAT before (gimme a break. im a fairly new cook) and gave it a try especially bcuz of the impossibility that anyone was able to rate it less than 5. glad i tried this. i made this on christmas and thought i had all the ingredients and looked back at the recipe and realized it said one 28 OZ when i thought it was just a regular can and everythings closed so i had to use just one and a can on tomato paste but everything else i left alone. oh and it said in your description you could/should add any other veggies so i used everything here and a little fresh broccoli as well. WOW! thats very rare that every single person that rates esPECially on this website gives something 5 stars. idk why more ppl havent tried. it is SO GOOD!!!!",
