I used olive oil instead to be even more healthy and I put some garlic powder, Season salt, a little bit of cayenne pepper, a little Mrs Dash, and Herb Poultry seasoning (kinda like Italian Seasoning) and they were a lot better than I thought they would be! Also they are a really healthy version of the French Fry. I also cooked them a little more than the recipe said! Totally would recommend them to anybody!!!! I even saved the breadcrumb mix so I can make them again.",

I crushed up crutons and put them in a second baggie with some extra salt and pepper. I then shook up the wedges in the second baggie. I cooked them on 450 until brown without turning. Absoulutely wonderful! I will definitely make these again. So easy to make and better than french fries because you can actually taste the potato. And as a bonus my husband loved them!
