I let my mixer knead it and then baked at 350 degrees for about a half hour. I didn't have enough dried pineapple so I added some chopped dried apricots and I forgot the powdered milk. You can really taste the mace so if you don't like that flavor reduce it or leave it out. This bread is delicious--reminds me of what you can get at a bread store. YUM!",
