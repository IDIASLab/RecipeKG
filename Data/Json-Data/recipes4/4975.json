I tried to reduce fat and calories by using light sour cream light cream cheese and 2% sharp cheddar; I didn't feel like the flavor of the dip was compromised. I used the entire container of sour cream instead of the 8oz called for in the recipe. The flavor of bacon was good but not over-powering using real bacon pieces (found by the salad dressing at the grocery store). I served Ritz reduced fat crackers along with veggies (red pepper carrots and celery). A super easy recipe AND good?!? It's a keeper in my book:)PS- Even better after it sits overnight!",

There is a lot of flavor to this. Found that it works best if left out of the fridge for about 30 minutes before using on potatoes or spreading in celery. Thanks Luanne A. for sharing this recipe. UPDATE: We spread on French bread slices and popped the bread under the broiler. It made for a yummy creamy treat.",

The bacon really adds a nice smokey flavor to the dip and the onions give it a slightly spicy taste. I didn't set the dip in the refrigerator overnight like the recipe states since I didn't have time but it still tasted great! In fact I don't know if that step is necessary because when I tasted it the next day it seemed the same to me. So if you're hesitant to try it because you're making it at the last minute it will turn out just fine. This will be a dip that I make often whenever I need something easy and quick to take somewhere. Thank you for the recipe Luanne!",
