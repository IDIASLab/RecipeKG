Well as soon as I got home I searched and found this recipe for blackened tuna.  A few days later I had a friend over and we tried this recipe and what a success.  It matched closely to the blackened tuna I had at the casino and possibly turned out better.  This recipe is very simple and takes little time.  The only thing you need to watch out for is buying a cajun/creole seasoning without salt.  Because of the generous amount of seasoning you will put on the tuna, the salt content is extremely high if you choose a cajun seasoning with salt.  Just a tip for people who need to watch their salt content.",

Half the butter/oil and pour a small amount in skillet. Season tuna steak and put in skillet.  Smoke will be intense when you first put steaks in skillet.  Pour rest of butter/oil on steaks then turn.  Cook for same amount of time as original recipe calls for.  Steaks will be nice and blackened.  I also use this recipe for swordfish.  Very delicious too.",

If you enjoy the air quality in your house you will not attempt this one indoors! The first time we made super spicy blackened tuna indoors we couldn't breathe! The best way to cook is to use a seasoned cast iron pan and lid and stick on the grill. Make sure your grill is hot so you can seal in the moisture of the tuna and always be careful not to overcook. You can read about seasoning your cast iron pan on the internet at about. com.",
