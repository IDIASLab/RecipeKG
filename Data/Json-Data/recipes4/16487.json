Returned the shredded pork to the crock pot and heated for add'l 30 min.  Served on toasted Kaiser Buns.......DELICIOUS!!!",

All you really need to do is put your roast in the crock pot, I like to use a pork tenderloin 4 pounds or more, and dump a jar of hot banana   peppers on top. Cook until it's done.  Put it in a very very large bowl and take your hand mixer to it, it'll shred up in a matter of seconds, banana peppers included. Then mix up a blend of your favorite barbecue sauces start with Sweet Baby Ray's and what other sauces you like along with some vinegar and go on from there and don't forget to add the Liquid Smoke that's the key to the whole thing.",

The taste was not overpowering so my son who doesn't like barbeque sauce flavor could still eat it (and it tasted great)! If you want it saucier simply add some onto your pork on your sandwich. Top with coleslaw and you are all set to go! Fair warning- this gets very soupy during the cooking process so in order to place it on a roll and not have the bread turn to mush you need to be sure the meat is drier. If you are eating it out of a bowl no sauce problems at all. One of the best parts of this recipe was the incredible smell it made all through the house for almost the entire day- superb!",

Lots of leftovers in our two person household so I discovered the even better taste the next day! As I used a sweet barbecue sauce it made a very delicious base for wraps the next day. I just heated the pork and wrap for a few minutes and added a salad greens mix pea shoots julienned apple julienned cucumber and avocado no need to add dressing as there was plenty of flavour in the pork and wrapped it up. I added a large salad on the side for more greens Super delicious! My son loves the pulled pork! We have eaten and enjoyed lots and I still have enough for one more night! I will make this again!",
