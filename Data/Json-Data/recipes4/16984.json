Ok, here's my tweaks.  Since just salt and pepper just seemed too bland, I added some onion powder which was just the right touch.  Also, since we don't like runny casseroles, I beefed up the rice about a half cup.  Lastly, we love cheese so i added quite a bit extra.  Last note is that I broke up the biscuit dough into small pieces and scattered them on the top which covered it perfectly.  Quick, easy, cheap and goooood.  Our new go to comfort food.",

I did tweak a few things I added one large yellow onion while I was cooking the chicken and seasoned it with pink Himalayan salt pepper and onion powder and a T. Of minced garlic. For the water in the pan I added 2 T of Worcestershire and cooked threw. When I mixed everything in a mixing bowl I added two cups of fiesta cheese and I steered a bag of mixed frozen vegetable and did 1 10oz Can cream of chicken and 1 10oz Can of cream of mushroom just like my mom would do. This made of one killer recipe!!! Will make again and again my family loves this!",

I boiled all that for about an hour and a half then drained, discarded vegetables, chopped the chicken and followed the recipe. I also used cream of mushroom soup and whipped up a batch of drop biscuits to top it off. This is a good base recipe and can be altered to your specific taste. Wonderful!

Would definitely make again but would cover biscuits for first half of cooking as they browned before casserole was sufficiently warmed through.
