For those who don't know what browning sauce is, it is made by Kitchen Bouquet and it is called Browning and Seasoning Sauce.  I've used it to make brown gravey from the juices of a roast.\nI will be making this dish often.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.\n  ",

I sauted a bag of frozen Pepper Stir Fry in olive oil and then added the meat. The gravy was delish with a little doctoring. I also added some red pepper flakes and I used Adobo instead of season salt with an extra splash of Soy. My husband gave it two thumbs up. Was really good but there were no left overs at all. Only fed 2. Oh well. My meat came out a little tough but I would definately make again. My friend said to buy rib eye and slice it. Any suggestions with meat?",
