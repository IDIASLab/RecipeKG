I particularly liked the bacon garlic and tomato so there was no way I was about to change that. But I wanted something more complex with a greater depth of flavor. Also the microwave cooking method didn t appeal to me so I cooked it completely on the stove-top. And I figure the time I saved by not pulsing anything in the food processor and not bothering to puree any of the soup made up for any time lost by not microwaving. So I saut\u00e9ed some diced bacon added the directed holy trinity of onion celery and carrot the garlic but I also added a jalapeno pepper seeded and minced and a chopped poblano pepper although bell pepper would have worked fine too. (These measurements all based on the recipe scaled to 3 servings) I wanted it a little meatier so I added some cubed ham chopped cooked chicken would be another fine choice. I let that simmer awhile before adding the beans some frozen corn and a handful of chopped fresh cilantro. I used beef stock a little extra than called for in order to accommodate the extra vegetables. I served this with a little plotch of sour cream and some crispy tortilla strips. I tasted this before supper for purposes of writing this review (tho I never taste when I cook never have) and before you know it I had chowed down two bowls. This stuff is awesome good.",

I made a few minor changes just using what I had on hand nothing that would have had a huge impact on the end product. I made this soup without the bacon and used ground chipotle powder and bottled crushed chili peppers instead of the hot pepper sauce. I also threw in a can of corn...it just seemed to need that. I also did the whole recipe on the stove top and skipped the fooling around with the microwave. When I make it again I will probably still skip the bacon but will try adding a few drops of liquid smoke. The soup was a HUGE hit!",

But... here goes! -I think a lot of flavor would be lost if I nuked everything, so I did this on the stove. Taking some comments from Naples review, I picked up a poblano to add to this...and what the heck, I thought, a small sweet potato would be yummy too! I added the poblano and potato with the mirepoix/holy trinity. Once the veg cooked down, I added beef stock (canned) and tomatoes... fresh from the farmers market which I diced. With all the extra veggies and since I was halving the recipe, I only added one can of black beans (which I put in after the tomatoes simmered a bit). Here's where it may get weird: I had about 1/2 cup refried beans leftover from a different recipe and stirred them in. You'd never guess they were in there... I swear, but it made for a thicker broth. I didn't puree anything. Let me tell you how awesome this turned out! :) If you've read this far, hopefully you'll give the recipe a shot, even if you find yourself tweaking it too! It's delish! Trust me when I tell you: it's fantastically delicious!",
