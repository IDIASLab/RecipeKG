It got old, so I went looking for something new I could do with eggs and avocado. When I saw this recipe I was dubious. Having tasted all these ingredients separately, I just didn't see them tasting good together lol. Boy was I wrong. OMG this is so yummy! Even now that I'm not on mushies anymore, I still make this for lunch weekly. I always try to figure out what makes all these things taste good together, I think it's the sweet pickles. I use a pre-made sweet pickle relish cause I'm lazy lol, it really just ties everything together. So don't doubt it, try it! Yum!",
