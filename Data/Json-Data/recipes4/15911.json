I salt the slices for a while and dab off the water.  Then I put them in flour and let them set for a while.  Before making the hushpuppies, I dredge the catfish in the cornmeal/salt and pepper, and let them set a while.  I then dredge the tomatoes in the flour and let them set.  I set the table and heat up the deep fryer, then I dip the tomatoes into the egg/milk (instead of water) and then into the cornmeal.  I let them set.  Each time you let the flour or cornmeal set, it \"glues\" itself to the food.  I then mix up the flour egg/milk and cornmeal with some baking powder and minced onion, onion powder and make the hushpuppy dough.  Well, I got off the subject, but I hope this helps someone.",

I find that the cornmeal gives it a heavier taste and holds more oil than panko crumbs do.  I also gave them a quick spin in the blender to make them a bit finer.  It worked like a charm.  I added some cayenne pepper to the flour and left the salt out until the minute I took them out of the pan.   I placed them on a rack on a rimmed baking sheet so that the air could circulate around them and put them into a preheated oven of 275F while I cooked off the rest of them.   WOW!   They are AMAZING and were perfectly browned AND not greasy AT ALL!   Great recipe!",

One did them 2 parts flour to one part cornmeal and the other did 2 parts cornmeal to one part flour so it is just a matter of personal preference I suppose.
