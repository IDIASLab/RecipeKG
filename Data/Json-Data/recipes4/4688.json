I substituted granulated sugar for confectioners' and added 1 T of corn starch knowing that it may be gritty in texture. But I could not get the balls to form nor did I know how to dip the messy balls into the chocolate my hands were sticky. It was all so messy I put it aside. I will use the mixture to make a groundnut sponge cake Nussschnitten. Substituting granulated sugar may have caused the problem in forming balls.",

I used toothpicks to dip but they stuck to the \"balls\" when I tried to drop them on the cookie sheet. Would give this five stars if the directions addressed the dipping part.",
