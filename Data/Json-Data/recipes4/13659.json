Not sure what's different--I remember discovering the peanut butter but I was more fascinated by the bananas with mayonnaise and chopped peanuts that were served as a side dish. It totally distracted me. Anyway we love this dish and I'm taking it tonight to the church potluck where other former African missionaries and a few African exchange students will be eating.

Extra salt and pepper It still need helped so I added a large can crushed tomatoes and small can of whole tomatoes That did it! Created the taste combo I was looking for. Also used mushrooms carrots celery and bay. Just a trace amount of potatoes (2 small) which I added at the end. Then a huge container of baby organic spinach once I turned off the heat. Delicious!",
