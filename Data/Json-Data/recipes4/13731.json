I also added some pepper because that is what I like. Otherwise this is a great recipe for a busy night. Pop it in the oven and forget about it.",

I baked this in an 7 x 11 pan. When you add the macaroni mixture to the pan cover with about 2 3/4 cups of boiling water. Don't stir. Cover with foil for 30 minutes - after 30 minutes gently chop the spoon through the mixture and bake uncovered for about 30 more minutes. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",

Also the crumb crust actually SANK. I think I will seek out a recipe that is much more specific about the amount of liquid. I would have given it one star... BUT! I keep everything. I never throw anything away. So I stored this in the refrigerator overnight (after it was cooked and partly served) and YOWSAH! It was firm and when sliced and reheated quite YUMMY. So I'd have to say plan to cook it longer and if possible cook it a day ahead.",
