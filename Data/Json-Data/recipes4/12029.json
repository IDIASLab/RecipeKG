I could see by the quantity of dry rice that it was wayyyyy too much. I just scaled it down to what I normally use...1 cup rice to 2 cups water. Didn't have any cardamom pods so used 1/2 tsp. ground cardamom. Also stuck 4 cloves in w/the rice and frozen peas. Used heaping 1/4 tsp. tumeric for the yellow color. Very nice dish. Definitely recommend the cilantro. It adds a nice layer of flavor to the dish.",
