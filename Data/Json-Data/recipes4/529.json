I added a TABLEspoon of Worcestershire and several dashes of hot sauce as well as increasing the flour to almost a full cup because we're at HIGH ALTITUDE. I rolled the dough onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet which I think probably better keeps the crackers from sticking. I highly recommend rolling out the dough until it is VERY THIN otherwise the squares come out like thin cornbread with only the corners getting crispy. Be sure to separate the cracker squares on the baking sheet. This is a recipe I will use again - next time making the squares a bit more \"fancy \" perhaps piercing a design on the dough (before cutting) using the tines of a fork or some other decoration. I served the crackers with the Vegan Black Bean Soup (5 Star Top 10 Vegetarian Recipe) - a \"SOUPER\" combination!",

I sprayed the dough with a light mist of canola oil and baked as directed and wound up with 84 crispy little jewels.",
