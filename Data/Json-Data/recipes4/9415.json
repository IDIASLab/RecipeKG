I added some s&p thyme paprika and garlic powder and that seemed to be a nice combo. Also I'm not sure you NEED to add the 1/3c. milk... ours came out just slightly runny and probably would have been fine without it. Probably a matter of personal preference. Lastly took the advice of some others and sprinkled some sharp cheddar cheese on top the last few minutes of baking.
