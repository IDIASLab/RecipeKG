With this recipe, however, my macarons stuck to the parchment paper and that has never happened to me before. I liked that the macarons aren't as sweet as the ones I've made before and seem lighter. That's why I would like to try this recipe again and see if maybe I should have baked a little longer... I'm not sure what the cause of my problem was but these cookies are difficult to master so I will troubleshoot until I get them right. I have previously used buttercream as a filling and it is great (strawberry or lemon/lime) but I went with dark chocolate ganache this time and it is decadent! Update: Made again and decided to bake at 350 degrees for 6 minutes, then switch cookie sheets (I moved the one that was on the upper rack to the bottom rack and viceversa) and bake for 6 more minutes. They didn't stick to the parchment paper this time. I added a few drops of creme de menthe oil to half of the batter and colored it green. Again, I used chocolate ganache to stuff them with. Very good!",

At first I was worried they wouldn't turn out well because I'm not that great when it comes baking and French macaroons at professional level. I gave it a try today after reading reviews and tips. They turned out really well! This is so simple compared to other recipes I checked out. I dyed them blue using very little food coloring knowing the color fades a little. We bought keylime icing and had that in the middle. They had the perfect consistency. Even my picky younger sister ate them and ended up loving them. This recipe is a success!",

First, I put my almond flour in the food processor and pulsed it a few times.  I had a really hard time getting the AF through my sieve the first time around.  Seemed to make it easier.  Second, use a silpat if you are able instead of parchment.  It makes a huge difference with them sticking.  I had no problems.",

I started with this one, and couldn't be more thrilled that I did.  I followed recipe exactly as recommended.  I used parchment paper, as they stuck to my silpat. A couple comments: I made two batches: Batch #1, I didn't beat the egg whites and castor sugar as long and baked exactly as recommended.  They turned out vibrant in color, and not overcooked, a bit chewy and got rave reviews.  Batch #2, I beat the egg white and castor sugar a bit longer (it was a bit more stiff) and then baked on convection.  These were very crisp, not as vibrant in color, but still maintained a great flavor.  The texture was extremely different.  These also got good reviews, but cracked more and weren't as pretty as my first batch.  They also weren't as easy to fill with the buttercream b/c they were more delicate.  They did, however, fall right off the parchment paper with no issues! I made yellow lemon with a raspberry buttercream, green mint with a dark chocolate buttercream and purple almond/vanilla with rasp on some and chocolate on others.  Went off beautifully for dinner party.  MMMMMMMMmmmm\u2026:-)",
