I doubled the recipe and by doing this I found the dough a bit too stiff so I added another tablespoon of water....this made them better to spoon out into the tins....it is a rather stiff dough though but bakes up real nice. If using paper liners after cooling them put them in a large zip lock bag....the moisture will loosen up the papers a bit. Will make these again.",
