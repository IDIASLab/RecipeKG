You get so much color from the vegetables that I don't think that tri-color pasta would enhance presentation. I used mini-cukes so no need to peel and added a little more honey to suit our tastes. After refrigeration the pasta really soaked up the dressing so I think I'd add more dressing the next time. This is a nice pasta salad with a lot of fresh veggies and was enjoyed on a hot summer day.",
