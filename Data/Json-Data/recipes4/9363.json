I used a 'banana cream' pudding mix, 1\u00bd large bananas, and I baked it in a 9x13 metal pan. It only took between 35 and 40 minutes, so be sure to keep an eye on it or it might end up kind of dry. My cake was wonderfully moist. I followed the glaze recipe but added 4 oz of softened (left on the counter for a couple hours) cream cheese. I needed a little more milk to make it spreadable, but it was awesome. Sprinkled some walnuts on top, and let it set for a couple hours. I DID leave it in the pan, but it's easy to lift out slices if you grease and flour the bottom of the pan. We had company over and she loved it! Thank you so much, Barbara!",

Use a package of lemon or vanilla pudding and add 2 cups of shredded zucchini 1/2 to 1 tsp cinnamon and a dash of vanilla if you wish. I also used applesauce instead of the oil and used 4 egg whites and 2 eggs instead of four whole eggs to cut down on fat. Very moist and very delicious!",

First whip the cream cheese with electric mixer add in confectioners sugar until well blended. Add in cool whip with a spoon. Spread on cake sprinkle crushed wafers all over cake and VOILA.",
