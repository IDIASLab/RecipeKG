I forgot, so I called him and he followed the recipe and made it himself!  Let me add, the most my son has ever cooked was grilled cheese.  I recently decided that I'd never taught him how to cook and should do so soon! I'm a single parent that just didn't take the time to show them.  Well, here was my chance, albeit over the phone!  When we got to the onion part, he said, \"what's an onion?\"  Oh please, he really didn't know what an onion looked like? Well, he figured it out and I talked him through quartering it, etc.  He then asked where he should put it.  I said shove it up the same hole that you took the bag of stuff out of.  lol.  My other two younger kids loved the chicken too and we are going to all start cooking together!",

It deserves 5 stars because of the moisture of the chicken flesh - between the slow cooking and the wine there was not a dry spot in the chicken even in the breast. I'd like to try to find a way next time to have the sauce flavors penetrate the chicken more - perhaps I'll inject with a syringe halfway through baking. Note: of course this is not a \"crispy skin\" chicken recipe (it's covered when cooking). Probably if you gave it a good 5-10 minutes broil with butter on the skin at the end you could get a crispy skin although I don't have experience with such a technique. Overall thanks for the recipe!",

The chicken had delicious flavor and it paired nicely with 'Parmesan Garlic Orzo' from AR and a tossed salad.  I now have the carcass and some added spices and veggies in the crockpot, overnight, making a wonderful broth in which I will freeze tomorrow.  Thanks, FrackFamily5 for sharing your chicken recipe.
