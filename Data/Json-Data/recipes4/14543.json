When cooking the chicken you basically cant leave it and I would suggest turning the heat down when you leave it to simmer. To make the rice a little tastier I added curry and pepper to it and then when it was cooked I threw in some peas and scrambled egg- delicious! Overall very tasty juicy easy to make and it didn't make a lot of dishes so I will definitely do this one again!!",

I know the tendency is to blame the cook, but I use timers in all my cooking and did so for this one. Clearly, there is a problem somewhere after the first 8 minutes. The other side of my chicken was burnt well before 12 minutes after turning it. (And yes, I added water and poked the holes before) If the recipe is followed as it is written, it is not edible. I had to edit this a couple of times, because I was quite grouchy after attempting this recipe. All this recipe yielded was an irritated husband, an irritated wife, a messy kitchen and a hungry household. Save your time, frustration, and the mess!!",

Turns out great every time - - the last few times we made this one we used it as a wing recipe - bake the wings (on a pizza stone if you have it) in a preheated 375deg oven for 10min each side. Transfer the wings to the honey mixture and bake again in the oven. Depending on your oven bake for another 10min each side. The wings come out crispy and delicious!",
