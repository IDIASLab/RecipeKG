Note: if using fresh green chile, add 1/2 cup of chicken stock for added liquid. Serve with your favorite corn bread.",

I did use fresh Hatch green chiles so I did put chicken broth in it. I also felt it definitely needed more liquid. I added a can of drained Rotel (green chiles & tomatoes) and a can of cream of chicken soup. I did not have any cream style corn so I used drained canned corn. It was perfect! At the end I threw some cream cheese in just to fatten it up!! LOL It was a little spicy so that's why I added the cream cheese!! Enjoy.",

                "reviewBody": "It was good I made some changes the 2nd time I made it & I think it enhanced the recipe. Cook the bacon a little longer than called for (crispy edges) it gives the soup more of a concentrated bacon flavor. 2 onions vs 1 add a green pepper 2 stalks of diced celery 1 jalapeno (the cream kills the heat but you get a little bite vs only green chiles) 3 cans of cream corn vs 2 4 lbs of chicken vs what the recipe called for. 1 can of condensed cream of chicken soup and 1 tablespoon of better than bouillon chicken base (this stuff is amazing). The extra corn & chicken flavor really livened it up. I took one of the chicken breasts cubed it & simmered in some chicken broth until I could shred w/fork and added it to the soup. So you get a mix of shredded & chunks of chicken. I thickened it up w/a little instant mashed potato flakes easy trick for soups if u want to thicken. I also added some quesadilla cheese to the soup. Top w/diced green onions when serving. Next time I make this I will try some variety of white beans. I think beans would be a nice addition. Thanks Papa Dar. Thumbs up!",
