After mashing with a potato masher I didn't like the texture so I put it through the blender. The result was a creamy delicious soup. I was going to add bacon but thought it tasted great the way it was. It's not a good diet food because of the high fat and calories but it's an excellent comfort food and treat. The three servings produced were quite large.",

I used homemade chicken stock instead of water and bouillon but when I cooked it like the recipe called for the potatoes absorbed all the liquid and all I was left with was mashed potatoes. I used 3 medium sized potatoes and ended up adding about another 2 cups of stock. I also used an 8 oz block of cream cheese instead of the cheese spread which I added and then pureed the soup. I added 6 slices of bacon cooked crisp and chopped up. It tasted fantastic and everybody in my family loved it. Will definitely be making this one again.",
