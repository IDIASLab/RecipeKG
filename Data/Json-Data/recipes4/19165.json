You know the kind you unscrew the lid and drop your jewelry down in the tray. While they do work okay there has always been a few issues I have with them. 1. I've never felt comfortable dropping any of my rings with stones in it because I don't know what all is in it and if it would damage them. 2. The liquid becomes black after the first two uses and the smell is rancid. 3. The containers are small and only work for small jewelry. For bigger pieces you have to get an old toothbrush and do them by hand. Well not anymore! I tested this recipe out with some of my more tarnished pieces and it worked like a champ! The best part is that I was perfectly comfortable dropping the ones with stones in knowing that none of the ingredients would harm them. This worked great and it is one I will use often. Goodbye store bought cleaner! Thank you for sharing!",
