Instead of using water, I used organic beef broth. This is very, very good. I had a cup and a half for lunch today and I'm thinking about going back for more. What I love most about this is it's filling without going overboard and you can indulge and half a little more without feeling guilty. GREAT recipe--a snap to prepare.",

Some people don't like chili minus the \"beef\" component, so I take some wheat berries and quinoa and cook in some veggie \"beef\" broth by Better Than Bullion and it gives a great flavor, and texture to the chili that satisfies my non-veggie friends.  Additionally, the grains give a lot of nutritional value in an almost non-fat medium.\n\nHope you enjoy it if you give it a try, and thanks for a great recipe!",
