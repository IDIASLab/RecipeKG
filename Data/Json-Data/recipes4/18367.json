Well, it didn't to me until I was pestered to try it by my coworkers during my time in Korea. It's a very healthy and invigorating soup made with a baby chicken stuffed with ginseng, daechu (red dates), and glutinous rice, and cooked in lightly salted boiling water. Enjoy with rice and other banchan or side dishes.",
