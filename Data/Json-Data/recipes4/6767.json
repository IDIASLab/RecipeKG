So easy to make!\" 1st I've never seen frozen blend of green beans and carrots so I used frozen green beans and 1/2 c. baby carrots that I quartered so they would cook evenly. I don't quite understand the main photograph for this recipe as it appears to have feta butternut squash (?) and mushrooms (?) in it. Other than the fresh to frozen carrot switcherroooo I was faithful to the recipe. I thought this was a tasty and new way to eat our green beans but b/c they weren't very good reheated the next day I would reduce the servings next go-around so that there weren't any leftovers.",
