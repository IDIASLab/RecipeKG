I don't like having to deal with the fresh jalapeno, so I subed for the jarred sliced kind. I just added the juice to the oil and it tasted great without too much heat. I also chopped some of the jalapenos up and added them to my sour cream mixture along with a couple of tablespoons of the jalapeno juice. I like to go ahead and add the cilantro directly to mixture too. Instead of cabbage I chop up romaine and add on top of the sour cream sauce and fish :)This recipe is also great with pacific snapper!",

Just put the slices on an oiled foil lined cookie sheet and drizzled some fresh lime and creole seasoning. They cooked up to a perfect flakiness at 425 degrees in only ten minutes. The sauce just needed more flavor was very limey tasting and I had some chipotle peppers in the fridge so I chopped one and put it in the sauce that went on the slaw boy was that ever good but not too spicy. I made my slaw up early in the day and gave it time to marinate. I did use the plain sauce as a topping without the chipotle in it. These were so very good and really easy to make and. Served with some juicy Florida corn on the cob.",

I used Blackened Seasoning on the shrimp when I sauteed it, the rest of the recipe was the same...loved it!  My son who is home from college saw me making the sour cream/lime dressing and said the restaurant where he works (in Lubbock, TX) makes this to serve on enchiladas.  It was great on the slaw and as a topping for the tacos. Will definitely try this with Tilapia too.  Great recipe!",
