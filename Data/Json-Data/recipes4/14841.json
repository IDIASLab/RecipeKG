I use all the same ingredients, but I don't follow the directions exactly, because I thought it was a bit complicated with too many bowls, extra time for marinading and an oven. Instead I threw the mushrooms and onion (I use fresh onion) into a deep skillet with the marinade sauce. I sauteed that until it is soft, about 5 minutes, then I add the sour cream sauce and toss for 1-2 minutes like it says. Then I toss in pasta. So much easier like this and it tastes great. I can't say how it compares to the original recipe, but I like the way mine turned out and it is a lot easier for me. The only ingredient I omitted is the wine because I don't have it. My hubby also really likes this and compliments it everytime I make it.",

I'll admit I did cheat a little and not make it vegan I added a little cream cheese to finish it off. I also sauteed some onions in butter. I know I know not the exact recipe but OH so GOOD! This is going to be a regular recipe for me and I will do it vegan. Btw - also did some Shitake mushrooms with it and as others suggested added the marinade into the cream sauce (yes all of it).

I have to confess that I used regular dairy sour cream because I had some on hand so our version was vegetarian but not vegan. I would like to see the recipe adjusted to actually serve four people. The two of us ate every bite and we are not big eaters. Honestly if I had tried to serve this to four people it would not have been enough. I suggest using four portobello mushrooms and increasing the sauce and the marinade by 50%. Whatever--it's great!",

I do some modifications because I am gluten sensitive and also need low sodium. I use gluten free fusilli pasta instead of flour I use 2 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of soy sauce I use coconut aminos. I also double the olive oil and balsamic vinegar when cooking the mushrooms because I don't add wine. I use 1/2 of a not-beef natural bouillon cube in the vegan sour cream again to keep sodium down. I also add 1/2 tablespoon of basil for flavor. I use white pepper instead of black pepper ( personal preference). Instead of store bought vegan sour cream I use the recipe online called \"the best vegan sour cream\" from glutenfreeveganpantry.com. I copied the recipe and pasted it below. It works fantastic in this recipe and no need to buy vegan sour cream. I omit the salt out of this recipe to keep the sodium down again personal preference. The best Vegan Sour Cream 1 cup cashews soaked over night cup 2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice tsp sea salt 1 tsp nutritional yeast cup water INSTRUCTIONS Place all ingredients into your blender (I used my Vitamix) Blend on high for 5-7 minutes scraping down the sides as needed until very smooth and creamy. Transfer to a mason jar or other airtight container. NOTES The best vegan sour cream can be stored in your fridge for 1-2 weeks.",
