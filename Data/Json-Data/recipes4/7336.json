It's also easier than the others - bonus! I used a 42 ounce jar of pasta sauce and thought the sauce ratio was perfect. I used a variety of different pastas I had left in my cupboard and I followed the suggestion that Italian cheese blend could be substituted for the cheddar and thought this was amazing.  I will definitely make this dish again!",

The ginger and garlic help keep the gamey taste out of meat (a Pakistani recipe secret!). I always use Newman's marinara sauce but I also added a little water to thin it and a tsp salt and half tsp black pepper. Salt and pepper are to taste. In a bowl I combined the mastaccioli pasta (3/4 box) shredded mozzarella 1 jar pasta sauce 1 pound lean ground beef and stirred them all together before putting half of the mixture into a backing dish (I froze the remaining). Cover and cook for about 15 mins. I had the oven on 475 for the biscuits so the pasta went in too. Enjoy!!",
