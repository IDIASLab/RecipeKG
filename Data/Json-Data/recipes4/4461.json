This recipe was given to me by a friend and has gotten rave reviews from squash lovers and squash haters alike. Fresh squash, bell pepper and onion are given an extra boost of flavor and texture from cornbread stuffing mix.  This is a lightened-up version of the original recipe, but you won't miss a thing!",

I added sliced zucchini, garlic, grilled jalapeno cheddar sausage, and corn to the last minute of the above saut\u00e9ed mixture. I mixed cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and spices on the side, and then combined it with the veggie/sausage mix.
