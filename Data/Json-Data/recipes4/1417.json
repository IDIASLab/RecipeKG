I used 1 and a 1/2 onions and the aroma was very pleasant while cooking. My husband is a very picky eater as is my son and they both enjoyed the entree. The meat was tender and fell apart as I took it from the bag. I made sure the fat was trimmed off the front I think that made the difference between tender and stringy. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish and will make it again.",

I rubbed the beef with rib rub wrapped it up in 3 layers of foil and before I closed it up added a maybe 1/2 each of red wine vinegar and soy sauce. Popped it on the BBQ over indirect heat for 4 hours. Every once in a while I turned it around NOT over. By the time I figured it was done I poured the sauce in a lil pot added some chopped onions/cilantro. The family Loved it! 6 thumbs UP! Thanks Tobysgirl Keeper for sure!",
