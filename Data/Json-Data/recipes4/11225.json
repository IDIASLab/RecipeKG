                "reviewBody": "Doubled the recipe and substituted a jar of medium salsa for the two tomatoes required (Safeway Select Roasted Tomato Salsa: EASILY the best salsa available in any supermarket!). I also added a tablespoon of ketchup to nullify the spiciness a bit to make it more kid friendly. The only problem I ran into is that the additional moisture of the salsa made it impossible to brown the bacon inside the vegetable mixture. So Instead of cooking the bacon until it was brown and crispy I just made sure it looked more or less \"done\" and reduced the moisture a bit before adding to the beans. I also dumped out some of the standing water in the bean pot to reduce moisture there. In the future I will probably prepare the bacon in advance though honestly it wasn't AT ALL bad with the bacon just \"done\". My kids (ages 11 9 and 4) really enjoyed it and the ketchup added just enough sweetness to the dish to make it taste like baked beans. Lastly we served this dish as a main dish with rice and tortillas. I and my wife found that wrapping a mixture of beans and rice in the tortilla made for a very nice burrito. Anyway thumbs up all around.",

When looking over the recipe I noticed there were no spices so I added ground cumin and was glad I did. Once the bacon carrot onion and garlic were cooked and tender I did not drain the fat from the bacon before I added the beans and I liked the extra flavor it provided. I simmered this for about 10 minutes adding chicken stock as necessary so it wouldn't dry out. This was tasty but I think the bacon fat and cumin were significant flavor contributions. Loved the addition of the tomatoes carrots and parsley for color. This was a perfect side dish for the \"Chicken with Tomatillos and Poblanos \" also from this site that I served it with.",

Since I don't own a pressure cooker I use either the crockpot or a Dutch oven. I empty 2 to 4 cans of undrained black beans in the crockpot add two cans of water cover with lid and cook on low to medium. While that is heating on the stove I brown diced bacon draining on paper towels when crisped and reserving a tiny bit of the fat. In the reserved bacon juice I saute onion carrot and tomato. I always use more carrot and tomato than the recipe calls for. The carrot pairs nicely with the black beans. I add 2 chicken bouillon and then add this mixture to the beans in the crockpot. Cook on low-medium for maybe an hour depending on your crockpot's temperature. I cook rice in the rice cooker while the beans are cooking. I garnish with parsley or cilantro fresh salsa or sour cream. Leftovers are to die for. You can add more liquid or chicken stock and make this a soup. Very very tasty.",
