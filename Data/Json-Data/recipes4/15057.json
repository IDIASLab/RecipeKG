I diced up 1 medium onion and 1 red bell pepper and sauteed those with the zucchini and garlic. After sauteing, I added them to the greased dish where I placed a half jar of marinated artichoke hearts in a sparse layer on top (I will use the whole jar next time..they were tasty!). I followed the recipe to a \"t\" other than that and it turned out great! It really creates its own side, and with all the veggies and the use of olive oil (and I used lite salt) it made for a healthy AND delicious meal!",

I added just a bit of dry white wine to the oil b/c the heat was a little high and garlic began to brown too quickly. I would have never guessed that veggies alone could create such a fantastic sauce. The fresh basil really adds to the flavor. Served over pasta and everyone had seconds and thirds!!
