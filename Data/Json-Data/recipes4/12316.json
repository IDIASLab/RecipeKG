Bread flour would probably have made a more dense and chewy loaf, so for comparison, I will make this again with the correct ingredients next time.\n\nI also did not bake the loaf in the bread machine. After the dough had risen, I removed it from the machine, shaped it into an oval loaf and let it rise again. I slashed the top a few times and put it in a 350 oven for 45 minutes. It turned out very nicely.",

From experimentation, I prefer to cut the caraway seeds to 1-1/2 teaspoons, and the cocoa to 2-1/2 tablespoons, and increase the yeast to 3 teaspoons.  I found that dissolving the molasses in the warm water helps, too.  I prefer using strong blackstrap molasses in this recipe- it gives the bread a more robust flavor.  Also, this bread actually turns out better on the quick cycle in my breadmaker than on the whole wheat or multi-grain settings.",

For the liquid, I used a combo of potato water (from draining potatoes for mashing) and leftover coffee.  After reading \"Best Bread Machine Bread\" on this site, I tried adding the molasses and yeast to the warm liquid and let the yeast bloom for 10 minutes before adding remaining ingredients.  Our first loaf is almost gone.  For the second loaf I added 3/4 cup raisins dusted in some of the flour.  I put raisins in at beginning of cycle, increased caraway seeds to 2 Tbls. and salt to 2 tsp. and let bread machine do its thing.  The texture of the second loaf is even better than the first.  My husband, a native New Yorker accustomed to excellent deli bread, gives this bread high praise.  It's a keeper.\n",

I have the solution for you!  \n\nI originally made the recipe exactly as written, and then I made it with a few modifications to make it SUPER RISE.  In fact, it hit the glass top of my breadmaker and was really light and people loved it.  If you want it to SUPER RISE, do this:  1) add the full amount of vital wheat gluten.  This is NOT optional!  (Need I explain why?  Bread rises because yeast releases CO2, but that isn't sufficient--you need protein structure to contain the CO2 and keep it from escaping, and that protein is GLUTEN!)  2) Add 2 tbsp (tablespoons, not teaspoons) of honey  3) Add 2 tbsp (packed) of brown sugar 4) Use Fleishmann's Rapid Rise yeast (NOT active dry yeast).\n\nIf you follow these 4 additional steps, and the pumpernickel is not light enough for you, I'll eat my hat.",
