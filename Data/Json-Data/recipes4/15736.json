I did not have time to soak the millet and it still worked out just fine (the texture had a little bit more of a bite but that didn't bother us at all). I added the curry powder cumin and millet to the onions and garlic and cooked for a minute or so before adding the water. Next time I will use ghee instead of olive oil and add a little cayenne. Thanks for a delicious recipe!! Instead of adding 1 tsp. of salt I just added it to taste.",

I did add tomato I did add culantro and peas I did add a scotch bonnet pepper to the pot just to give it some heat I used grapeseed oil. I sauteed the garlic and onions with the curry and the tomatoes before adding the Millet and the peas. I didn't soak the millet I just rinsed it off prior. After the two and a half cups of water I just added the cumin and some salt and pepper. I've been meaning to try millet this is my first time ever making it so i'm happy it was simpler than I thought and I think the next time I make this I will add some golden ray butter and maybe some carrot.",
