While I cooked the rice (2 cups white long grain rice), I sauteed the sausage in a small saute pan. Meanwhile,  I sauteed onion and pepper in a large sautepan until tender. Then added remaining ingredients except the tomatoes in one pan and simmered. I added the tomatoes in the last 5 minutes. When rice was done, I stirred in the rice. Very enjoyable rice dish! And the leftovers make a great fried rice!",
