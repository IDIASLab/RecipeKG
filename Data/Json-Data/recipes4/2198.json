A better way to cook the eggplant is to slice it in 1\" pieces, place the pieces on a paper towel, and lightly salt them.  Leave them for at least a half hour (2 hours is ideal), then pat them dry.  Cook them at about medium on the stove in some oil, stirring often, for about a half hour or until they lose most of their water and turn a darker color.  The texture and taste of the eggplant really comes out this way.  The rest of the recipe was quite tasty.",

We had an indian night and this by far was our favorite dish.  Perfect soft consistency.  Pick 2 small eggplants instaed of a large one because it will be more tender and not have the bitter flavor some eggplants get when they're too big.  Perfect spices, and the onions are amazing.",

I finished cooking it and my 14 year old daughter came floating into the kitchen with a euphoric look on her face (she's my most discerning taster), and said, \"Dad, what is that smell....hmmmmmmmmmm.\"  I said, \"here, try it.\"  (she claims to \"Hate\" eggplant).  I gave her a fat forkful of this with a big chunk of eggplant and her face melted into bliss producing, after a few resonating moments a satisfied smile.  I said, \"what do you think?\"  She said, \"it's amazing.\"  I said, \"thank you, I'm glad to see that you have an appreciation for eggplant.\"  her mouth dropped and her eyes opened wide and she said,\"are you serious? this is eggplant?\"  I said, \"that's right kiddo, thank you for being open and willing.\"  This was a big hit and is in my list of staple meals that we eat regularly.",
