I made only a few substitutions, regular broccoli in place of broccoli rabe and added in a fresh zucchini from our garden.  Used Cajun chicken sausage from Sprouts.  Other than that, kept the recipe exactly as is. I imagine this would be great with spinach or kale if someone did not have broccoli on hand.  Will make this again!",

I subbed chicken broth for white wine (didn't have a bottle open). I also used turkey Italian sausage, which I find can be harder to brown evenly due to the texture. To compensate, I let the sausage cook a little longer and added some extra liquid when needed. This dish has a wonderful kick and literal zest that we really enjoyed. I immediately had requests to bring the leftovers for lunch the next day! This one is a keeper.",

Added more spices when sauteing the onions & garlic including my favs oregano, tumeric, rosemary. Added the white wine using it to steam a wide variety of veggies including carrots, yellow squash, zucchini. Added mushrooms, sliced grape tomatoes, green peas, fresh red pepper last. Then mixed it with parmesan cheese and stirred in cooked pasta. Much easier to make than standard pasta primavera, lower fat too. Squashes absorbed the flavor of the wine & spices and really tasted good. Thanks for sharing the basic recipe. Encourage others to adapt it to their taste preferences.",
