Instead of salt and chicken broth I used 3 cubes of Consomate Tomato and Chicken Bullion (Mexican Section) and 6 cups water.  It'll save you a little, adds good flavor, and gives it more of a red appearance like Campbell's.  Oh, and I used an immersion blender.  All in all my Favorite Tomato Soup!",

I wanted to try something different and this soup is wonderful. im not exactly how many pounds of tomatoes I had. A friend gave me a whole bunch of them so I just stuck them all in the oven. I did roast the onion too and I just added the chicken broth slowly until I got the consistency I wanted. I added cheddar cheese on top in my bowl. the best soup ever!

The had beefsteak tomatoes on the clearance shelf so I grabbed a bag, almost a perfect 3 lbs.  This is the second time I've made it and very pleased both times.\nMy tweaks included chopping up half a jalapeno with the tomatoes, sticking a few mushrooms in with double the garlic when I added them to the pan.  Used veggie broth (Better than Boullion) and put a few dashes of Worcestershire in the stock.\nEven after sitting for an hour I could notice the flavours deepening.  Will be awesome tomorrow!
