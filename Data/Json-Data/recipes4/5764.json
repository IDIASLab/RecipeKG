They are low carb and do not use breading, therefore they have more of a baked and seasoned texture.

This is also tasty made with shredded parmesan (can be found with the bagged shredded cheeses) instead of grated. I sometimes add minced garlic or garlic powder to the seasoning as well.",

Tilapia, by nature, can have a very muddy or earthy flavor if you're not used to it. I don't understand why the other reviewer blames that on the recipe! I would make this again. To avoid a soggy filet on the bottom, I flipped mine halfway through cooking. I also added a bit of garlic powder. I really like that it's low carb - perfect for my south beach diet.

I sauteed it about 3 minutes per side on about a temp of 6 or 6.5 on my stove. It was quick, easy, and delicious. Only change I made was we squeezed fresh lemon juice over ours before eating. ty",

Easy -- place a cooking rack on your baking sheet and place the fillets on the cooling rack. Ta da! No more soggy bottoms! :)   \nAlso, if you find the olive oil to oily in the finished product, you can use mayo or melted butter (just brush on fillets with a pastry brush), then coat with Parmesan mixture. I often cut back on the Parmesan and add in some seasoned bread crumbs since I don't worry about carbs all that much and the little bit you use here won't make much of a difference anyway. This does add a bit more crunch to the finished product as well. I also add a dash of garlic powder to the breading mixture. Just play around with this recipe and tweak it to you and your family's liking. :)",
