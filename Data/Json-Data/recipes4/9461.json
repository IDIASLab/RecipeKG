You may have to play with the level of heat (that's what I needed to do) to get great results. But when you get it right, MAN, THESE TATERS ARE GOOD! I was just popping them in plain, without even adding butter. The crispy outside and fluffy inside make these really, really good. Definitely worth a second chance.",

And I do not have access to them but I decided to use my nonstick pans anyway with the thought they would not turn out the same as advertised. And no they didn't but I'm okay with that. They actually cook pretty well this way even in a nonstick pan--they turn out very soft and buttery and the salt flavors the potatoes almost like the Salt Potatoes I've tried--but with way less salt. I also put in some dried rosemary and parsley and I liked them that way. I had to cook a bit longer--about 10 minutes more but I knew they were done when one potato pretty much fell apart in the pan. Nice potatoes and easy--just don't expect a crisp outer shell in a nonstick pan. I also don't know what the \"screaming\" is all about--maybe they are \"screaming good\"? Not a clue but thanks for the recipe!",
