I had no scallions so did no after-cooking topping. Because of my husband's preferences I omitted the ginger and garlic (which I thought might be a bit strong for salmon anyway). Also I baked instead of grilled for simplicity's sake. But all that said I think the heart of the recipe is the marmalade-soy sauce-oil-vinegar glaze which is delicous and keeps the salmon moist. A keeper recipe good for 2 or company.",
