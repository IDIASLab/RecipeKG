Only I didn't grill it (no room on the grill), I buttered the cobs and sprinkled the seasoning on, wrapped them in tinfoil (already husked them)and popped them in the broiler at 400 for 1/2 hour.  Very tender, better then boiled. The child in my house didn't try it, but I'm sure he would love it!!  Thank you for the recipe. P.S. can't wait to try it on the grill!!",
