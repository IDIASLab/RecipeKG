I did add a bit of salt per our tastes, and sprinkled the feta on top of each portion b/c my little guy doesn't care for it. We eat rice every week, so this was a nice change from the usual, and is definitely going into the rotation~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I followed the recipe as written except for the following changes which I don't believe significantly changed it: I used brown rice and added 1/4 tsp. of Greek herb mix since the feta I used was plain. I will definitely make this again and will include sauteed onion or shallots and some oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes for extra flavour. Thanks Terry for sharing your recipe!",
