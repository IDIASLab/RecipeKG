                "reviewBody": "So I looked at what other people were saying about this \"new mom kugel\".  First off, the reason this kugel does not have cheese is because often times when we have \"kugel\" is when we are having a meal with meat. If you are Jewish, many people choose not to mix milk with meat.   So I thought that the other adaptions and reviews were right on.  First off, add the spice. I usually do a few shakes of black pepper, salt, garlic powder, onion powder and sweet paprika. I also added a 1/2 tsp on chicken soup mix powder. I also mixed 3 cloves fresh garlic to the onion saute.  If you are making it dairy the parm cheese is a perfect addition or I would say cheddar would also work.  Thank you for a great side dish!",

I rated this with 5 stars with my changes because the recipe was so easy and used a minimal amount of ingredients.  I couldn't imagine cooking eggs/quiche without cheese, so I added about 3/4 cup feta cheese, 1/2 cup parm cheese and garlic powder.  also decreased to 1/2 onion since I was making more of a breakfast quiche.  I also used 2 - 10 oz packages of chopped broccoli.  SO Easy and the ingredients readily available in the kitchen.  Will definitely make again!  Only cooked for @60 minutes until golden brown.",

I made some changes to this recipe which made it a 5 star for me. I took the suggestions from StephD and added 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese and added 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder because I didn't have any cheddar cheese on hand and the parm cheese was the perfect flavor. It didn't need to bake for 90 min. but one hour was sufficient and I would recommend coating the baking dish heavily because the egg mixture will stick to the pan. I enjoyed this very much and so did my husband.",

I also added 1/2 to 3/4 of a can of artichokes that I chopped up.  I did not have time to cook the onion so I just used onion and garlic powder.  I also used fresh chopped broccoli.
