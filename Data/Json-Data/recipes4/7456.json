I did however cut and individually wrap the salmon pieces. I grilled them over medium heat for 5 mins per side then I moved them over to indirect heat for the remaining 5 mins - total of 15 mins. Next time I will only grill for 10-12 mins. While there is nothing \"smokey\" about this recipe it is very tasty and I will definitely make it again. One pound of salmon for 2 people makes VERY generous servings. I prefer to cut a pound into 3-4 pieces. Also no need to oil grate (!?) since the salmon is not directly on grate. Thank you wendi!",

It smelled smokier than it tasted. Next time I'll add 2 drops. Also, instead of using the BBQ, I cooked the two 4 oz. salmon fillets in a preheated oven at 400F for 15 minutes. My wife, a retired high-school foods and Home Ec teacher, said it was perfectly done. I'll have to take her word for it - most of my cooking is by the book or guess work and sometimes I get lucky. (This meal earned me an \"A\") I placed the foil packet on a rimmed cookie sheet and when dishing up the salmon, poured the liquid remains back over it. Served on steamed rice with a Caesar salad from a bagged kit on the side. Thanks for posting the recipe, Wendi. It was lovely and I will make it again.",

I made it as close to the instructions as possible but did not have the ingredients for the creole seasoning so I used Old Bay seasoning instead nor did I combine the seasoning with the syrup instead I put the seasoning on the salmon then drizzled the syrup (which was butter flavored) on along with some hickory smoked liquid then put less on than a tablespoon of butter for both cuts wrapped in foil and cooked it on my electric BBQ for 20 minutes in between 350-375! It was perfect!!! Made broccoli cheddar rice and green beans! Will defiantly keep this recipe! Thanks for sharing!",
