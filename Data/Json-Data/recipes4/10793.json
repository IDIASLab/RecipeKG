Leave it for about 20 minutes.  The eggplant will be covered in \"sweat\", because it is sweating out the bitterness.  Rinse off your eggplant, and cook accordingly.  Yes the water that comes off will be sort of brown.  This will make the eggplant taste better and will eliminate the unnecessary step of boiling, which will make the eggplant mushy.",

I am beginner to cooking with eggplant so I took advice from everyone, sweat the eggplant in a colander,marinated the chicken in balsamic,lemon juice and olive oil and I layered it with ricotta. I think I overdid the cayenne and salt. Anyway wasn't bad for my first try,  I topped with an Italian five cheese blend, we eat cheese by the pound at my house so I knew that would go over well. Next time I will get black olives to use in it. I agree use lots of spice.",

I then diced up the chicken the same size. While the chicken and onion were cooking I crumbled 300g feta (12 onces if you are in the US) over the eggplants.  I added the tomato paste, oregeno, red wine (about 1/4 a cup), the water and 1/4 cup of olives to the chicken mix.  This turned out great, a bit liquidy as the eggplants do release a lot of moisture - so next time I will take away 1/4 a cup of water and use the red wine in its place.  Serve with a crispy greek salad with plenty of tomatoes and cucumber.",

I did change one thing because I have yet to discover tomato paste for sale in Japan.  I ended up using a can of crushed tomatoes, reduced in a saucepan for 1 hour, and omitting the water.  \n\nDespite my being worried about the eggplant sitting in water for 30 minutes, I followed the recipe but it didn't turn out mushy at all - in fact it was quite the perfect texture.\n\nAlso, (regarding an earlier review) I didn't measure out the amount of oil I used, instead just brushing a thin-ish layer on both sides of the eggplant strips - just enough to cover it so it doesn't burn when saute\u00e9d.\n\nSuggestions for next time would be to add grated/minced garlic when adding the tomatoes, and black olive halves over the top just before baking.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed, and this recipe comes highly recommended.",

I marinated diced chicken thighs in a splash of lemon juice and balsamic vinegar. Salted the eggplant slices for 30 minutes then sauteed. Added 1 diced roma tomato with chicken/onion. I used half red wine for the water and whisked the tomato paste into that before adding to the pan. After pouring the simmered mixture over the eggplant I deglazed the pan with chicken broth and poured that on top. It is a good dish, next time I would dice the eggplant instead - the slices were too large for our liking. Served with egg noodles but rice might be easier to manage.",

I also dotted the eggplant with small spoonfuls of ricotta cheese in between the eggplant and chicken, which added a nice creamy layer.  YUM!",
