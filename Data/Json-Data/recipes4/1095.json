I used a package of taco seasoning with the meat, omitted the onion, jalapeno slices, salt, and pepper (taco seasoning has most all that), and used 1 cup lowfat cottage cheese instead of cheddar (as the \"Broccoli Cheese Cornbread\" recipe on this site called for).  I baked it for 60 minutes, but it still wasn't done in the middle, so I microwaved those pieces and they were fine.  I used \"Jiffy\" brand cornbread, which is very sweet; that, along with the can of creamed corn, overpowered the flavor of the taco seasoning, so I think next time I will add some chili powder.  Note that skim milk works fine in this recipe.  This was a super easy, filling, and large casserole, and I will definitely be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and cooked the ground beef with pack of taco seasoning and fresh garlic and I doubled up on the jalape\u00f1o's and reduced the milk to a cup. I also increased the cheese by 1/2 cup putting 1/2 cup into the mix and then 25 minutes into baking I put the balance on top. I must say it smelled great while baking and looked great coming out of the oven! The 20-25 min time is way off as noted by others, it took a good 50 min to cook through. Definitely glad that I tried it and will probably make this again. \n\n",

When I cooked the ground beef, I added onion, garlic powder, pepper, a dash of season salt and a pinch of salt.  Then when the meat was done, I added a can of manwhich sloppy joe sauce and added slices of cheese along with some american easy cheese by kraft.  As the cheese melted and the manwhich blended with the meat, I snuck in a can of peas for some nutrition, lol.    For the cornbread I used 2 boxes of jiffy mix, 2 eggs, and the creamed corn.  I added my milk last which was a very little bit that I eyed, because I noticed that the creamed corn, helped smoothed out the batter as well.  So I only added a little bit of milk to finish smoothing it out. Then I folded in my groud beef, placed everything into my buttered pan and placed in the oven.   But instead of placing cheese on top of the cornbread, I made my cornbread like I normally would, which is to rub some butter on top of the cornbread so that it turns golden brown, but only do this once the top is firm enough to handle being touched.  I didn't need the cheese on top cause I had cheese in the meat.    In the end, this was great, quick and easy.  I will definitely make this again !!!!!",
