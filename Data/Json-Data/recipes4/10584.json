I also threw in a handful of bean sprouts and shredded carrots. I used a little more soy sauce than called for..(but I love soy sauce so for me the more the merrier). I made this to go along with the broiled tilapia recipe also found on this site. Thanks Krista.",

Constantly was ordering this dish frequently at restaurants and never NOT order it when eating chinese/thai/japenese food. It occured to me that it would be fabulous to simulate the type of fried rice I devoured at these restaurants right at home. This recipe looked the easiest as I am by no means an experienced cook. I put in green onions and carrots instead of normal onions and beans and I also had left over chicken breast which I sliced up and added in to make it \"Chicken Fried Rice\". At the last minute I realized I had no Soy Sauce left so I improvised and used Lea and Perrins Worschestire Sauce instead. It turned out to be delicious!! Obviously It didn't have the soy sauce flavour but what I ended up with was tasty and unique. This was soooo easy to make and I am considering making it again tommorow! This is a home run!!!",

I made the following changes to the recipe: sesame oil instead of veggie oil; 1 cup mixed frozen (thawed out) veggies instead of onion and green beans. I also used low sodium soy sauce. The rice came out pretty tasty for homemade Chinese food but it was a bit too salty for my palate. I might decrease the salt next time to 1/4 tsp since soy sauce has a good amount of salt in it to begin with. I also feel like the taste is \"missing something \" though I have no idea what. I will look to reviewers' comments next time to make improvements. Will try this again and play with it a bit.",
