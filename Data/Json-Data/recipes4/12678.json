I modified this recipe a bit by 1) adding chopped broccoli and zucchini to the mix doubling the dry spices to accommodate the extra veggies 2) adding some 2tsps chili spice and 2tbsp parsley 3) using fat-free chicken broth rather than water (this works for us since we are not vegetarians) and 4) mixing in 1/4c of parmesan cheese into the mashed potato mixture. I also sprayed the baking dish lightly with Pam and baked for 30 minutes before browning. It rocked my family loved it and it tasted even better as leftovers for my workday lunch the following day! Give it a shot if you have the time.",

Subbed veg. broth in place of the water and added some salt and pepper to the vegetable mixture as it cooked. Used some leftover mashed potatoes I had in the freezer (made with russet potatoes half and half butter salt and pepper--a recipe from Cook's Illustrated). I wondered if I had to cook the frozen peas before mixing them in with the mashed pototoes but turned out I didn't--just mixed them in frozen and they came out fine. I mixed the parmesan cheese in with the potatoes and peas and kept the whole thing in the oven about an extra 10 minutes--didn't do the broiler step. It was yummy. It does have an Indian taste though as another reviewer pointed out and that might not be for everyone.",

I love both vegetarian food and Indian spices but I thought the flavor of curry powder was overwhelming and a little one dimensional. It would have been helpful for the recipe author to specify the blend of spices in her curry powder. Perhaps my blend didn't suit the recipe and that's why I didn't care for it. That said it was easy to prepare and I liked the consistency. If I did make it again I would probably stir some sour cream and chopped cilantro into the vegetable mixture to add another dimension to the flavor.",
