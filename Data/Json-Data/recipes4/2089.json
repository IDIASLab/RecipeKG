I used vegetable broth and left out the chicken and cheese and I used uncooked quinoa instead of cooked rice so the soup was a little heartier. Plus I used fresh oregano (and a little extra to pump up the flavor) and about 1/2 tsp sea salt. By itself the broth was VERY spicy but the garbanzos and avocado helped mellow out the heat. For me it didn't need the cheese--the flavor combo actually tasted a bit cheesy on its own.",
