I also reserved about 1 1/2 cups of mozzarella to sprinkle over the top, along with some more parmesan.  I did not use the pepperoni because I felt there was plenty of meat and flavors already.  Very easy and very tasty!!!",

It wasn't quite 64 oz like the recipe calls for but it was enough! I used the traditional kind and ricotta cheese kind. Next time I think I will use the chunky garden vegetables kind, or chop up some green peppers to put in there as well. Also, I will mix cheese with in the pasta mix as well instead of just on top. And for the meat, I will use just a half pound of hamburger and 1 1/2 pounds of the italian sausage to add a little more spicey-ness to it! Lastly I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and sauteed them about 5 minutes before I put them in the mixThe auther says she halves it for her family and makes the whole recipe for family gatherings; She's right on! I was making this for just my fiance' and I and I decided to make the whole thing because we wanted leftovers since we don't cook a whole lot...we only ate maybe an 1/8th of it and we were FULL! Next time I will definatly halve the recipe and there will be enough still for a day or two for left overs. GREAT recipe! I will make again, it's a keeper!",
