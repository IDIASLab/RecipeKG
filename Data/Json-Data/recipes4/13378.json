                "reviewBody": "A very tasty flavorful recipe. I love the addition of the cumin and fennel seeds (yes they are pricey but they are a must in the dish. Ground cumin will not work. And you'll probably find yourself adding the seeds into other dishes. They create a nice zip to salads.) I usually add 1/2 lb of ground beef to make it a heartier meal especially during the cold winter months or if I am too lazy to make rice but the vegetarian version is also nice. I think turnips are an underused vegetable and this recipe uses them to maximum advantage. I like how the turnips start to absorb the tomato mixture flavor. My only problem is that I usually have some water leftover in the pot. The liquid doesn't create a real sauce so I usually drain the mixture before serving. Overall great dish. It won't appeal to all taste buds but we certainly enjoy it.",

I added a couple grinds of fresh melenge pepper in place of the salt. I also used regular garam masala because I didn't have any Kashmiri garam masala and added it in the last few minutes of cooking. It was wonderful with the changes and would prob be wonderful with no changes. It is extremely flavorful and the blend of spices is perfect. You won't miss salt at all in this dish if you choose to omit it. It has the sweet savory taste of a good Indian dish with the turnips adding a nice sweetness to the dish. No one will know they are turnips unless you tell them. I was asked what they were because they were 'so good'. I served on a bed of Saffron rice. It was a perfect compliment to this. I would suggest a bed of rice to accompany this dish. Use your favorite.",

The recipe was easy took about 20 minutes start to finish and the flavor was wonderful. I agree that the fennel seeds are crucial to the flavor. I normally don't like turnips but the spices covered (or mellowed?) the sharpness/bitterness of the turnips and I scarfed them down with no problem (as did the kids who just said that the \"potatoes\" were a little weird)! The sauce is a little watery but we served it over rice and the rice soaked up a lot of the juice.",

I used 1 c. stewed tomatoes as I didn't have fresh. Next time I'll try using the whole can. This was just wonderful. It was a blend of spices that we don't use often enough so it had a very unique fantastic flavor to us. A true keeper. Thanks!",
