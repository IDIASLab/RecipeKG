Instead of Apricot nectar, I used about a half cup of preserves and a half cup of water. I used more dried apricots, about 3/4 of a cup, chopped. I only had dried ginger and garlic, and used about 1/4 tsp. of ginger and 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder. The flavor was amazing! All my kids ate it without any complaints (and two can tend to be picky about salmon.) I did have to watch it under the broiler though. After broiling for about 10 minutes, I baked it for another 10 on 350 since the rest of my dinner wasn't yet done.\r\nThanks so much!\r\n",
