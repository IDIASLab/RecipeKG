I used both leftover kielbasa and about 3 beef brats which I sauteed in olive oil with the onions eventually adding thawed frozen multi-colored peppers. I added additional apple cider vinegar and also honey adjusting the flavor to my preference. In place of the tomatoes I added a few tblsps of ketchup. My pineapple was fresh but I didn't add anything close to two cups. A little garlic powder and cayanne can't hurt either. Will be good for today's game....GO PATS!!!",

It's a different take on smoked sausage and I can't honestly say I'll do it again since we love more savory dishes prepared with smoked sausage. This works great with pantry items so for a quick turn-around it's worth the effort. I do think the sausage should be sliced thinner though.",
