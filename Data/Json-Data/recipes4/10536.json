Once I added the noodles the liquid was basically all gone...and I ended up adding chicken broth I had on hand to at least keep it simmerable for two hours. Tasted great though and very easy ingredients are usually ones you have on hand and with two kids with the flu I was happy to have found it. I think its a great simple recipe to try but I wouldn't add ALL the noodles at once till you're comfortable with the amount of liquid in the soup.",

I had to make so many changes I should have wrote my own recipe. First of all there isn't enough liquid for the amount of ingredients. I used 12 cups of liquid and the amount of chicken bouillon accordingly. I cooked the vegetables in the broth. I cooked the chicken seperately. It was bland to say the least. I then added a few bay leaves some dried oregano and basil poultry seasoning and lots of black pepper. I added the chicken back and simmered for about 15 minutes. I cooked only 6 ounces of the egg noodles which was more than enough. I added the noodles at the end to keep them from being mushy. My soup at this point was delicious and got rave reviews. Just a note... it doesn't take 2 hours of simmering to be done. Mine was done in half the time.",

Then I switch the crock pot to high and add the noodles (half what the recipe calls for 12oz is waaay too much)about an hour before serving.",
