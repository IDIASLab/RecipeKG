I used flank steak instead of sirloin and I didn't have any green onions, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  We both though it needed a bit of something, so after the first few bites we added some crushed chilis for a bit of heat.  There are so many different ways you could make this by using different veggies and seasonings. I liked the addition of the sesame seeds. I'll make this one again!",

(1) I added roasted garlic infused olive oil instead of vegetable oil and (2) I did have seeds so I used sesame seed oil. I mixed both oils for the amount needed.  (3) I added more fresh garlic.  (4) I used leeks instead of green onions, since that is all I had. (5) I lightly seasoned the meat with garlic salt and lemon pepper.  Be careful not to use too much garlic salt since you need to add soy sauce.  The meal was wonderful with white steamed rice.  Very simple and easy to make.",
