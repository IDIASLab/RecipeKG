I recommend using LOW SODIUM broth like I did as it was salty enough using the low sodium variety. I might even dilute it down the next time with 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup of low sodium chicken broth. This was really good. I suggest a dash of pepper on the chicken mixture before you top it with stuffing mixture. Thanks Stacy this will be a keeper!:)",

With that said I found the recipe as written to be lacking in not only additional simple ingredients but the amounts as well. 5 ounces of evaporated milk is not enough to result in a creamy consistency. Use a whole 12 oz can. Feel free to add other veggies and herbs. I added chopped celery and mushrooms as well as fresh crushed garlic. Hubs liked it and came back for seconds. For a busy family that doesn't really \"sit down\" to eat and wants something to fill the hole this will work. For me I'll pass.",

I found the recipe to be pretty easy. I admit I made some adjustments due to having read a few recipes like this and our own tastes. I had made my own stuffing mix and seasoning blend. I used cream of chicken because it is what I had. (I know the celery would have been great too) I did not have evaporated milk so I subbed sour cream. I also added about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar to the creamy mix. I think it added a nice touch! If you do not like this recipe as written try adding some herbs to your liking and some cheese.",
