I substituted a number of things:  shrimp for the chicken because I needed to use it up, broccoli for the zucchini, added 1 more tomato because they were on the small side, and mozzarella for the feta.  I also didn't use the second 2 tablespoons of olive oil.   And I used 2 garlic cloves minced.  It only took me 45 minutes to get it on the table after receiving this recipe in my e-mail wondering what to cook for dinner.  It was a lifesaver.  My husband said it was as good as going out for a nice dinner.  A very versatile recipe.",
