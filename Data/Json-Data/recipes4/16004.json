He thinks this is what \"sealed the deal\" so to speak!   lol  I let him think that ;-)\n     \nThis casserole is in the oven as I am writing this.   I stole a little bit before I put it in the oven and it is AWESOME!   OF course my husband's version is very straight forward.   Blue box Kraft Mac and Cheese, 1 can tuna, a slice of Kraft Singles on the top (cut diagonally, because he's fancy) hahahaha   Then baked.  PERFECTION!   lol  Just between us though... This one is MUCH better!   I did swap out the mushrooms for peas just because I was in the mood for peas, I also added in a little Dijon mustard, but that's it.  Oh, and I still got Kraft Mac and cheese, but the fancier one that has the cheese sauce in it,( because I'M fancy!  lol) unlike the orange powder (what IS that stuff anyway? )lol   I love it and can't wait for my husband to get home so he can have it tonight.   Thanks Melissa Loudy for posting this :-)",

Tip: for those who think 1 cup of bread crumbs is too much. Just sprinkle over the top until desired amount is reach. Problem solved. 5 stars for ease in making the over all taste and its a good meal if your on a budget. Most usually have every ingredient on hand anyway! Great recipe!",

The recipe is basically make the mac and cheese according to the box, add a can of tuna, tops with breadcrumbs and voila! I added a bit of shredded cheddar as that's how I always make mac and cheese. I used 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs and that seemed still too much so 1/2 cup would probably be better. I should have used my tiny casserole dish because the medium sized dish was too big. By thinning it out so much and then adding breadcrumbs, it ended up very dry. I also only cooked it for a little over 15 minutes because it was so spread out. This is a super easy recipe but next time I'm going to use less breadcrumbs and a smaller dish.",
