First, it should be noted that the cauliflower should be very dry before mashing or the results won\u2019t be thick enough.  Knowing this is an issue of concern because I\u2019ve made this before, I knew adding the cream would not be a good idea so I left it out.  Also, I wish I had added the Parmesan \u201cto taste\u201d rather than the full amount, which for my taste was too much.  In addition to being a little too Parmesan-y, this needed some rounding out of flavor, and was improved a great deal with a little pepper and garlic.",

My husband said it was killer and my mother in law wouldn't stop raving about it.  A big hit. I love that there was no baking step.  I used a stick blender and it was all made in one pot.  Two heads of cauliflower was two pounds in the store, but after trimming and cutting was a little less so I might use slightly less cream less time just to make it thicker.  I had leftovers the next day and made myself lunch by topping a bowl of this with bacon and shredded cheddar cheese.  A great success worth writing my first review for.",

It was still a bit runny but not too bad. Next time after cooking the cauliflower I think I'm going to wring it out by putting it into a towel/cheese cloth and wringing out the water and then letting it dry out a bit. Then I can add the other stuff to make it \"creamy\".",
