I questioned him on his Mom's version to make it as close to her as I could and this was it! i have made this at least 50 times and it is always a big hit. I did make a few changes. I leave out the ribs completely. I sautee onions and green peppers in olive oil and put them right into the slow cooker. Also, a huge short cut, I buy two rotissarie chickens and just pull all the chicken right from the bone (this saves sooo much time)! Put the chicken in the crock pot along with all the other ingredients. I also double all the ingredients (still only using two rotissarie chickens)to have a full crock pot and have enough to freeze.This is just GREAT! Everyone tasting it always wants the recipe and very simple to make too.",
