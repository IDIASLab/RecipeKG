Based on some of the reviews that said it was too mushy, I checked it after 4 hours and determined it was done.  I also reduced the tomatoes to just 14 oz.  This recipe brought back wonderful memories of my mom's ratatouille.  As kids we LOVED saying the word and joking that we were eating stewed rats!  Kids can be strange.",

I confess I didn't have Red Gold brand so I used store brand. But thanks for a delicious and easy recipe!",
