Also seasoned the breasts and browned first while cooking the bacon somewhat to lose a little of the fat. Removed the browned breasts and placed the onion on the bottom of dutch oven potatoes and carrots next then the chicken and finally the bacon on top before adding the diced butter. Placed the lid on the dish and cooked at 350 about an hour and then turned to 300 until dinner about another hour. The chicken was tender as were all the veges and the bacon gave the dish a decidedly spicy flair. There was quite a bit of \"gravy\" on the bottom probably because the onion had cooked away to nothing and mingled with the bacon drippings and butter. Easy and complete meal in one pot.
