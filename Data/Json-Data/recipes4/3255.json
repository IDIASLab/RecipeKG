I didn't have italian seasoning so I used 1/2 tsp basil and 1/2 tsp oregano (I started with 1/4tsp each but it needed more flavor) reminds me of spaghetti. It only needs about a minute under the broiler though next time I think I'll just mix the cheese into the whole thing and not dirty another dish. My boys all gave me a thumbs up so it's a keeper.

I began with half a packet and ended up adding the whole packet... good! I used a dash or two of Emeril's Kick It Up Sauce in place of cayenne pepper. Also added twice as much of diced tomatoes than called for as well as added about 1/2 cup of water. A half hour of cooking is plenty! Good recipe that I will make again but believe that the flavor of the ground beef I used contributed to the flavor as well as the Muir Glen roasted diced tomatoes.",
