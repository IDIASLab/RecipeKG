        "description": "This flatbread with its sultry flavor makes for a unique appetizer or can be served in wedges to compliment a main course. After attending summer BBQs and pot luck get-togethers where I first tasted this unique bread, I finally persuaded my Middle Eastern friend to ask her mother for this recipe. While not at all spicy, Za'atar, common in Lebanese kitchens, is a blend of many spices that will make your taste buds sing. I often cut this flatbread into bite-size pieces and serve it with small individual bowls of a good quality extra-virgin olive oil for dipping. Double dipping allowed this way!",
