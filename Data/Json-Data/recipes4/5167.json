I used real parmagiano-reggiano and asiago instead of fontina. \n\nI served this with farfalle pasta, grilled chicken breasts that were thinly sliced, 6 slices of julienned bacon that I rendered until crisp, I sauteed chopped onion and the minced garlic in the bacon drippings -- drained all of those and set it aside. I also diced 3 roma tomatoes and wahed 3 cups of fresh baby spinach. \n\nI made the alfredo sauce in a large, deep skillet and when it was done I added the al dente pasta. Then I added the sliced chicken breast, bacon, onions, garlic, tomatoes and spinach. I stirred the ingredients until combined, covered the skillet and brought it up to temperature on low heat, stirring occasionally until the spinach was wilted. \n\nDelicious doesn't even come close to describing the meal - much better than I've eaten at any chain Italian restaurant... and the sauce was the star!!",

Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly; cutting everything in half to make a smaller portion. I felt like a rock star when I was done, and I was stuffed when my bowl was empty.  I put the sauce on farfalle pasta with grilled chicken, spinach and mushrooms.  This was better than what I would have gotten in a restaurant.  Now when I have a craving for some pasta Alfredo, I can just make it at home.  I can't wait to try it with some shrimp and fettuccine. This really is a fabulous recipe.",

I followed the recipe and it was indeed rich and buttery but the Parmesan cheese never melted. It tasted great (which is why I'm giving it 3 stars) but the cheese left a gritty texture. My husband works late so I put some aside some for him and he was not impressed at all. He said it reheated poorly and the sauce separated making it unpalatable. It's a good basic recipe but next time I'll leave out the Parmesan and use it to garnish or use a different cheese and less butter to prevent the sauce from breaking down during reheating.",
