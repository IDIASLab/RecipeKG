We like our pork a little pink so we did adjust the time to suit ourselves. Only trouble we had was there seemed to be too much flour which thickened the gravy to a paste hubby's first time at gravy so he added water and tried his best but the lumps were there. Didn't care cause it was best gravy ever! A million thanks for sharing this recipe! It will be a keeper! Yey KayDe5056! My 300th review on AR was a hit!",

I thought for sure that the 1 tablespoon of garlic salt in the gravy had to be a mis-print so I cut it back to 1 teaspoon and it was still too salty. We ended up rinsing the gravy off of our sliced pork and throwing away the gravy. Sorry but I probably won't make this one again.",
