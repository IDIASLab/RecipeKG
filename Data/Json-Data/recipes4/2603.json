I give this version 5 stars: Use 3/4 of a cup of diced red onion, and 3/4 of a cup of diced green peppers, for one zucchini. Use half a jar (at the most) of sliced and pitted black olives. You need at least a half a cup of feta. When layering, mix in at least 1/2 a teaspoon of rosemary and a pinch of black pepper. (Or it will be tasteless). Also, layer in one teaspoon of finely diced capers. Non-stick oil is not required - it has a lot of moisture due to the veges. A thin film of olive oil on the bottom is plenty. I made these changes and it turned out excellent. It would have been tasteless and disproportionate if I had followed the original recipe. (Other reviews have mentioned that it is \"missing something\" and I agree. It is missing rosemary and capers and a little pepper)",
