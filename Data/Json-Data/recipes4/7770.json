I fix it exactly as you do until \"skin-side up on a rack\" because I don't use a rack, instead I slice one large onion, 2 smashed garlic cloves, slice lengthwise 2 carrots, and two celery stalks.and a couple of rosemary sprigs under the chicken as well as two on the top.  I lay these in a pan to create a bed for the chicken, then proceed as above. When it's time to remove the chicken I discard the aromatics and then drain the pan juices for a wonderful sauce either with broth or wine.  Sometimes at the beginning I will strew around the edges of the chicken 1 dozen new red potatoes, don't throw these out with the aromatics just tuck them close to the chicken while it's \"resting\" and awaiting it's sauce. Experiment with the herbs too in your aromatics, like a TBS of oregano sprinkled over them, the flavor will come up to the chicken while cooking.",

Cooked for 50 minutes and let stand for 10 minutes during which time the temperature rose a bit more to get to 165 degrees.  I salted it on top of and under the skin with kosher salt and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours to draw out the moisture for the crispiest skin. It's important to use a young 3-4 lb fryer versus an older/heavier roasting hen which will turn out stringy and tough due to the short cooking time.",
