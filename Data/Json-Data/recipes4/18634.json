It is typically served stuffed with prosciutto and a local cheese called squacquerone but any soft cheese will work. Enjoy!",

I couldn't get mine to brown without oil so I brushed a little of the flat top and they immediately puffed up and browned. This is a very easy recipe and I'm surprised that no one's made it before now. Thanks for sharing.",
