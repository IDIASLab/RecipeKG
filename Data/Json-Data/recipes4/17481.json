I thought I had seaweed but turns out I was out so I added a pinch of salt to the dish. My stomach is very confused right now, but my tastebuds are happy",

I left out the walnuts but I love this recipe and have made it several times in the past few weeks including for other family members. I usually increase the amount of miso to about 1.5 teaspoons and spinach to a large handful. The seaweed and the extra miso are pretty essential for a bit of seasoning. It's great for the single cook or for using up an avocado.",

I would tweak it next time in the following ways: First, I'd add the walnut pieces at the end with the avocado. I'd like a bit of an acidic accent to distinguish all the flavors, perhaps mirin or rice vinegar. Last, I had to add soy sauce to spice it a bit. All the tweaks would be to my taste as I said, this was excellent and I'll cook it again. Thanks.",
