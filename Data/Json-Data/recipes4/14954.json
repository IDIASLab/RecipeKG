Paired it with my Traditional Sauerbraten for a home run.\nIf you don't have a press or ricer, the (traditional) way my Grandmother did it was to put the dough on a cutting board and then \"slice\" small pieces into the boiling water.  It's hard to explain, but basically she would cut about a finger's size of dough and scrape it to the edge of the cutting board.  Works great with this recipe!",
