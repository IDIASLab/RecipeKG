I simply didn t care for the thyme in this recipe but admittedly this just could be a personal taste preference. When I think creole I think bold highly-seasoned food but this was very mild and mellow. I don t know maybe keep the coconut milk but substitute some creole seasoning for the thyme? Or perhaps substitute chicken broth for the coconut milk keep the thyme but add some creole seasoning? This was OK and worked as a side dish to some grilled shrimp but maybe retitle the recipe because it s really a misnomer in my opinion. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

It seems every time a recipe calls for coconut milk, the result is bland. There was only a hint of clove taste also. Maybe those should just be added directly with some finely diced onion? It was easy, though, so I'll try using chicken broth instead and hope for a better flavor next time.",
