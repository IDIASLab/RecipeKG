I did not have an onion on hand so I used some dry, minced onion - never the same - and used minced garlic instead of powder. I think this recipe is a 5 but my husband said 3, he thought it was good but missing something - an onion perhaps? Loved the recipe, I have two deer in the freezer so I will definitely use it again. I do not feel that it would serve 8 though - at least not in this house!",

I've never made a stroganoff that has a tomato base to it, and I really liked the flavor that it added. I changed the method of cooking to be all stovetop, as the venison I used was quite tender, and wouldn't need to cook in the oven for an hour and a half. So I simply cooked the onion and mushrooms until all moisture evaporated, then added the venison, and  cooked until browned. Sprinkled all that with the seasoning and flour, cooked a minute, then added the rest of the ingredients. I did find that I needed 1 cup of chicken broth, as it wasn't enough liquid as written. I simmered the sauce for 25-30 minutes, then added in sour cream to taste (probably half the amount listed). I would definitely make this again. It tasted great! Might even add some dried herbs next time to take it up a notch. Thank you for the recipe!",
