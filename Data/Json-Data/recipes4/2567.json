The back of the can said \"Serving size 3 peppers in adobo sauce\".  I thought \"I like spicy - what's one more pepper\".  My sauce came out RED, not a creamy sauce like I saw in the picture.  Then I pulled the can out of the trash and read further \"6 servings\".  That means I had the equivalent of 18 peppers!! Whoo!  Talk about spicy!  I was able to take 1/9th and add some milk and sour cream, and it came out pretty good!  (Now I just have to fix this 8 more times to use up the rest LOL)",

If you control the amount of seeds that go into your sauce, you control the amount of heat.  I like to use a lot of peppers, for the flavor, so I try to get rid of most of the seeds so it's not way too spicy.",

I made changes according to my ingredients on hand: used lo-fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 8 halves)instead of leg quarters extra adobo (yum) and forgot the margarine completely. Instead of roasting the chicken I cut the breasts into 1 inch pieces and browned them on the stovetop in a bit of olive oil. From then I followed the recipe instructions & served on brown rice. Really flavorful healthy AND it couldn't be simpler! Thanks so much for the recipe Guera!",
