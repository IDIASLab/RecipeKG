My husband is a type I diabetic with high cholesterol, and this is so low-carb he doesn't have to take extra insulin AND it is good for his cholesterol count. He's very happy with the counts and the taste. I usually don't like the splenda recipes I make for him, but I had a few of these and they were really good!   I made them twice the size of normal meringues and cooked them ten minutes longer. They were too soft and getting brown on the outsides, so I wouldn't recommend this.  I will make them the right size next time.   btw: 1/2 Cup Splenda = 8 Tbsp = 24 tsp = 12 packets",

I had hoped to be able to pipe these like the ones I found in the store but it was too soft. I put mine in for an hour and left them in for a bit longer with oven off. The consistency was nice. Since I don't have health issue that require me to go sugar free I think I'll try this again perhaps with 1/3 sugar and 2/3 of the artificial sweetner.",
