Upon my most recent visit to Athens, my aunt let me in on a secret that takes this traditional dish to another level. Instead of the usual lemon juice, she said, add the juice of one orange. I tried this upon my return home and it is absolutely delicious! It may be awhile before I go back to lemons -- and this dish is as delicious as it is simple.",
