I sauteed the red bell pepper with the garlic (which I added more of) and some chopped onion in a little evoo/butter before adding the condensed soup water tomato juice (I used V-8) the spices and tomato. To make it creamy without too much fat I added a quarter cup of fat free evaporated milk. This was a nice tomato soup perfectly spiced. The only issue I had was that I would have liked more tomatoes and tomato flavor. Next time I'll use either less water and more tomato juice and I'll add more diced tomatoes. NOTE: This makes more than four servings unless you have really happy soup eaters. More like six healthy servings.",
