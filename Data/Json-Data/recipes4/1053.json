I followed it to the \u2018T\u2019, and therefore can review it.  \r\n\r\nI didn't give it 5 stars, because I felt it could have eased up on the Worcestershire sauce a bit.  I found that flavor overpowering, for the same reason I would never put a steak sauce on a good steak in a decent restaurant:  let the flavors stand on their own.\r\n\r\nSo less Worcestershire, and bump up the traditional jerky salt and pepper aspects, and you will likely have a winner.",

Avoid/remove the fatty or gristly areas (use for soup or stock). Lightly freeze the slabs.  Cut  along the grain to get the traditional texture - across the grain doesn't work well.  \nMarinate two days for extra flavor saturation. A few times a day, massage and turn the bag to redistribute the marinade evenly.  \nLine the bottom of your oven with foil to catch drips.  I don't turn the oven on until I have it all loaded so it's not hot to work with.  I also wipe down the door which gets VERY messy before heating.\nSeparate the thin cuts from the thick cuts.  Squeegee the marinade off with your fingers to remove excess.  String tips of like sizes onto wooden kebab skewers.  (I get 10 pieces easily on a skewer.)  Then lace them through your oven rack so they all hang down.  Alternate sides of the rack so you have them evenly distributed.  Place the thinner cuts towerd the front so you can easily remove them when dried.  Place a hot pad in the door to hold it slightly open to let the moisture escape.",

I cut down my baking time to 3.5 hours instead and it was well done. Another suggestion is that do select meat with least fat as possible and you will reduce tremendous amount of grease dripping while the jerky's being cooked (and your oven won't smell like it's burning too!).",

                "reviewBody": "My first time making beef jerky. I followed the recipe quite closely only leaving out the Italian seasoning and upping the hot sauce. I didn't hang them I put them on a rack over a sheet pan and used balls of tin foil to make the rack tilt on an angle to let the juices run off. I did four hours at 170 (lowest my oven goes for some reason) and they were nowhere near done...did a further 2 1/2 hours at 190. The texture is a bit off...any bits of fat (I did trim but there's always a bit) are oddly chewy and the rest varies from crunchy to tough. I think that the marinade requires an acid such as red-wine vinegar or lemon juice to give it a better texture and tang. It isn't bad...but it's not great. If I try again I'll use more hot sauce and some vinegar...It's a good thing I started early in the morning or I wouldn't be making the (baked) dinner I had planned. Thanks for sharing. EDIT: After letting them cool they were MUCH dryer than when I took them out of the oven. I think that the recipe should specify that they might not seem quite done when the time is up but that taking them out and letting them cool will dry them out further. I suppose if I had been experienced with this sort of recipe I would know that but I didn't). They are a little too dry now a combination of my own mistake and unclear directions. Again thanks anyway.:)",
