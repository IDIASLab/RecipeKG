This is a form of processed food which is really unhealthy, and can be replaced with one onion and 1 tsp. of salt.  2. I love my slow cooker because of its ease and convenience - when all ingredients can be put into the cooker at the same time.  I find it excruciatingly annoying to have to go back every half hour and add something else (therefore making it ultimately pointless).  I did try this recipe putting everything in at once - and it was a truly good dish (on rice).",

I used Spice Islands curry powder for the first time and overall the dish just tastes nondescriptly spicy with kind of a curry flavor.  Looks like I need to find another curry powder!  It still tastes good though and physically it turned out beautiful.  My method was a bit different.  Dumped everything in the pot (only change was to cut back on the peppers and use a can of coconut MILK rather than CREAM since coconut cream is that super thick, super duper sweet stuff you use in cocktail drinks and find in the liquor store) including 1/2 cup of water and the carrots (I like my carrots cooked through and they would not have been if I put them in near the end), stirred it up, set it to low and came back 5 hours later to a lovely looking curry in a rich sauce.  All I had to do was add some salt and it was ready to pour over rice :)",

Here are the changes I made: 1. Used light coconut milk instead of coconut cream to make healthier 2. Used a whole 10 oz bag of carrots didn't measure 3. Substituted 1 can chickpeas for 1 potato 4. Added some cauliflower (should prob be added with the carrots). 5. Added 1/2 an onion at the beginning Additional changes I want to make next time: 1. Add an extra can of chickpeas for protein 2. Add a handful of peanuts or cashews at the beginning With these adjustments - an awesome recipe! Delish!! Hint - spices will be cheaper at an Indian grocery store or in the international section of the reg grocery instead of with the normal spices.",

Like another reviewer recommended, I substituted 1 medium white onion diced and a teaspoon of salt for the package of dry onion soup mix. I also used three whole carrots, cut on a diagonal, instead of the matchstick carrots. I also cut the red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper by half, to 1/4 teaspoon each, which was the perfect amount of heat. I used coconut milk because I live in small town with no ethnic markets, and couldn't find coconut cream. Finally, I added about 1/4 cup of raw cashews. I put everything in the crock pot, and added an extra 1/2 cup of water, gave it a stir and cooked on low for 3 1/2 hours (didn't need to check and add water at all). I then tossed in 1/2 cup of frozen peas, and cooked with the peas for another 1/2 hour. Served with basmati rice and naan.",

I left out the Lipton soup mix and sauteed one onion and two cloves of garlic with the bell pepper in olive oil and then added all the ingredients and cook for less than an hour on low on the stove. I also added a can of garbanzo beans. I added the peas frozen at the very end. We served it with a green salad and flat bread for dipping.
