If you have any sense, you know that you have to use the very sweet strawberries, not the sour early season ones!  Also, since it is not made with milk, eggs, sugar, vanilla, this is not going to taste anything like what you are used to with tapioca pudding.  This dessert is made to taste totally different from your ordinary tapioca and it does it's job VERY well.  Whenever I make a recipe the first time, I make it exactly the way the submitter suggests.  Then if I am going to change it any, I do so on the second or third run.  The next time I make this, I will make a few changes:  I will mix half milk and half water, I will also sprinkle sugar on it or add a tbsp of honey",

I used defrosted frozen strawberries (what I had) and the liquid from the strawberries for the water. When I tried this right after making it while it was still hot I wasn't thrilled--a little too tart. However let it cool in the fridge and the sweetness of the strawberries will come through. I topped it with chocolate chips thinking that would help but I should've swirled them through while hot--it's a little too much to eat the tapioca and chomp on the chips. Still that's my addition that didn't work as the textures are too different. Don't be afraid to try this but don't expect traditional tapioca and don't be afraid to experiment. Thanks for the recipe!",
