There was no bitter after-taste, only the melt-in-your-mouth taste of buttery spritz.  The confectioner's sugar also makes this cookie very smooth.  GREAT recipe!  It's a definate keeper!",

I have NEVER been able to get a dough to go thru it without a hassle - until now! This is the most wonderful dough to work with. I did use all vanilla and no almond but stuck with the other measurements (I always use unsalted butter so I didn't play with the salt at all). It was a breeze - no chilling the dough. Couple of hints though - be sure to let the cookie sheets cool completely so that your dough grabs it (I even put my outside on the deck to chill them). Also I found that I got WAY more than 3 dozen out of a batch - I used the wreath and camel and tree patterns and a double recipe gave me more than 12 dozen cookies (I gave up counting at that point:). Finally I always find spritz taste better the next day (like pizelles they need that overnight rest to really let the vanilla shine thru). Good luck and definitely try this one!",
