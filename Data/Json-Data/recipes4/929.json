As another viewer suggested, I left the shrimp in the bag after the first shaking, refrigerated it for about 20 minutes while I finished my scotch and water and the deep fryer was heating to temperature, and then sifted excess flour off.  Placed in the deep fryer for 3 minutes, removed and covered with the sauce.  PERFECTOMENTO!!  I served it to myself with a spinach salad with mushrooms, hard boiled eggs, bacon bits, and the spinach dressing  from another contributer to this site.  I highly recommend this to any young, middle-age, or senior citizen.",

I've made rubber out of the big shrimp when boiling or grilling or they aren't done enough. These are fantastic. We love Buffalo Chicken Wings and I have a standard recipe I use for the sauce using Frank's Hot sauce (it's slightly garlicky as it is) and butter. I used that instead of making the sauce in the recipe. These were terrific! I've made them several times so far and I'll make them again.",
