I couldn't find the banana pudding flavor so I bought the cheesecake flavor and it still tasted light and delicious. This is one of those desserts that is great just the way it is but I think you could modify to suit your own tastes. I would love to see what might happen if I added a can of well drained crushed pineapple. Fantastic. Thanks for sharing!!!",
