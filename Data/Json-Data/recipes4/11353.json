I used 2 pound of lean stew meat, and I was in a hurry, so I half defrosted it, then I put it in a skillet with a cups of water and some garlic cloves, and let that defrost some more until the water evaporated and it slightly browned.  Then I put it in my crock pot with 2 cups of beef broth and the full amount of chili powder and more cumin than the recipe called for...about another half teaspoon more...and the red wine vinegar...left it on low for 8 hours.  When I came home, all I had to do was stir it and it all fell apart, and the juice was absorbed, but it was not dry at all, it was still very juicy.\r\nI made chimichangas out of it, but it could totally be used for everything!  Burritos, tacos, taquitos...I'm going to try it next with chicken, but the beef came out awesome...and because it was already cut up, there was no fat to mess with.\r\nMy husband and I both really enjoyed it!\r\nYou could also make machaca out of leftovers, if you have any!

I lightly browned the meat, then added all the rest of the ingredients, except the cheese, and pressure cooked for 15 min. I turned off the burner, but left the pot on it and let the pressure drop on its own, about 20 min. I removed the lid and transferred the meat to a dish with a slotted spoon and shredded it with two forks. I then returned it to the the pot added a small can of green chilies and cooked the juice down, but was careful not to dry the meat. I used large flour tortillas and even with scaling the recipe to 2 servings it still made 4 chimichangas. I put the cheese on top of the meat before folding. There was plenty of filling. I pan fried them in just enough oil to cover bottom of pan. I served them topped with mexican shredded cheese, salsa, and sour cream. I didn't have any guacamole or would have used that too. They tasted just like the ones I have eaten at Mexican restaurants. I Will definitely make these again.",

Found via Food Network some additions that made the flavor jump into the meat: Remove cooled meat to separate bowl saute 1/2 onion chopped & 2 cloves garlic minced in remaining meat juices and 1 T oil. When soft return meat to pan. Add 2 chopped tomatoes (I used 1/2 can rotel) & 1/2 chopped bell pepper (I also added 2 jalapenos). Let simmer til meat is moist not juicy. Remove from stove and assemble. I also added salt/pepper (since this recipe doesn't call for ANY). The meat is AWESOME. When assembling I did add some shredded cheese so we'll see how that comes out of the oven.",
