I can be an extremely lazy cook and while I wanted to make applesauce with pears to use up the pears I had, I really didn't feel like cooking it last night, so I put it in the crock pot overnight.  I eyeballed ingredients, mixed it up, and left it on low all night.  Woke up to a wonderful smelling house.  I chose not to puree this but just mashed it with a potato masher in the crock pot so I'd get a chunky applesauce.  It worked perfectly, and this is very tasty.  I used rather tart apples so was worried I'd need sugar immediately, but it is definitely sweet enough warm not to worry about it.  Very nice for breakfast with a side of toast!  Thanks for the recipe!",
