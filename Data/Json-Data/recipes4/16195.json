But I had most all of the ingredients minus the cream of mushroom and I was craving soup so I decided to give it a go. Glad I did because this was down right delicious. Salty but delicious. My main change was that I knew 3 cans of cream of mushroom was just too much for my liking so I replaced one of the cans of soup with broth. My other change is that I only had red bell instead of green (no biggie) but I only had half of one so I threw in a carrot to make up for my lack of bell. My cooked chicken was actually leftover grilled chicken and it added a ton of flavor. This soup was excellent and full of flavor except for the fact it was too salty. I recommend using reduced sodium soup and broth too. Ditch one of the cans of cream of mushroom and thin it out with low sodium chicken broth in place of the water. The rice also cooks in 30 minutes so 2 hours is not needed either. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this one and I will definitely use it again with my tweaks.",

I would probably cook it with a potato or two next time.",

I found that the hot sauce, used sparingly, seems to bring out the flavor in soups especially cheese soups, surprise, surprise.  I now use it in tons of dishes I would never have done before.  I always have frozen shredded carrot on hand separated into 2 cup increments, and tossed in about 1/2 cup.  Added frozen peas and a cup of left over Costco roasted chicken to the soup bowl and poured the hot soup over.  Truly wonderful.",
