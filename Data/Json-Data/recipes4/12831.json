I did use the smoker instead of a dehydrater and because I was using the smoker I left out the liquid smoke. Out of the 3 recipes I tried on this site this one was probably my favorite. The beer really tenderized the venison. I will most definitely make again.",

Anyone who really cooks knows that personal preference will guide you to make changes/substitutes to recipes according to your and your family's tastes. My family loves smoky flavor and worcestershire so I use the full amount. I do usually buy low sodium soy sauce and teriyaki and I don't notice a difference. I don't know how many times I have had to substitute on the fly because I forgot to check the pantry for the ingredients first. I always use twice the meat called for this recipe. I have probably run out of nearly every ingredient on this list at least once; there is always a way to handle it. Today I doubled the recipe but didn't have quite enough worcestshire or soy sauce. I used a little Mirin and added more teriyaki. Sometimes instead of regular salt I use seasoned salt. I have used onion powder and garlic salt. Whatever floats your boat. Cooking is a science experiment and trial and error is the path to perfection.",
