We have played around with different recipes and feel this makes something truly enjoyable - smooth, creamy, and packed with flavor. You'll need a sturdy blender, a nut milk bag or cheesecloth, and a bowl large enough to hold your milk during the filtering process, and finally a container to store your milk in.",

My dates were fresh and plump not dry at all. I considered skipping the soaking method but wanted to try the recipe properly. I am so happy I did. In an hour the dates had broken down and this resulted in a smoother texture in the final milk. Excellent idea great recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us.",
