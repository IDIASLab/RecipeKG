I've never heard that before! Asking for more meat?! Served it with \"cole slaw\" recipe from this site (the one without mayo - wife doesn't like mayo either) french fries, desert was apple pie ala mode with caramel syrup.

I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical with the combination of the ingredients in the marinade but this is the best I have ever eaten. I made baked potatoes and steamed cauliflower broccoli combo. It was a perfect Sunday dinner. I bow to you sir!!! :)",

I mean this recipe's marinade/sauce is the true star.  It is a blend that does not resemble cola, coffee, hot sauce in any fashion in the end, yet combined and set, then cooked resembles a sauce that will make you a star!!!\nIf you are afraid of heat, then back off the hot sauce, and cayenne pepper.  DO NOT omit them, as they are a intricate part of the flavor, simple add a drop or two of hot sauce, and the pinch of cayenne! \n\nI served \"Roasted Parmesan Rosemary Potatoes\" and \"Grilled Vidalia Onions\" (recipes from this site) with this steak, but I do plan on making this steak many times more this summer.  \n\nI then plan on making this marinade/sauce for a stuffed round steak recipe that I have in the fall and winter!!!\n\nI have followed Chef John for a while now, but I am now a devoted fan!!  Thanks for the easy, flavorful, star making recipe!!!",
