Grilling them in the foil packets covered with sauce made for ribs so tender the meat was falling off the bones. The BBQ sauce and applesauce combination gave just the right sweet/spicy taste. These are definitely going to become a staple in my menu planning. \n\nETA:  The last time I made these ribs I used a disposable foil pan rather than wrapping them in sheets of foil. Believe me, it didn't affect the taste at all, but was much, much easier to handle on the grill. I just prepared the ribs as directed using the foil pan, which I then covered with foil. Made cleanup a breeze.",

I followed the instructions and by far the best ribs I ever tasted. My wife said that I set the bar for her taste buds. My brother and mother told me that I might have them beat (they are experienced grillers). I used spared ribs instead of baby back which I will try next time. Watching my friends and family licking the bone clean was well worth the time and effort. Thanks for the recipe:)",

I added liquid smoke and I cooked them in the oven for 3.5 hours at 300 degrees. This was from the frig to the oven. Very very tender and was a big hit with all. I have a smoker and smoke my ribs very often while these are not at that quality with the added liquid smoke it comes close.",

My grill goes to 1200 if I let it...is that high? I kept it at 400 and the bottom of the foil was rock hard burned and stuck to the ribs. Do you keep the cover down? That affects the temp so would have been good to know. That being said the sauce was good though I would do 3:1 Q sauce to apple. I think this works better if you marinate overnight then either smoke or cook on indirect grill heat.",
