If you follow the directions and shut the heat off and let it sit it works swell for a slight hint of flavor. If you just boil it you don't notice it so much. I have found out if you use less water (not more spices) it gives more flavor to the pasta. Use 1/2 gallon of water and place pasta in the water when it is cold. Bring to a boil and turn off the heat let it sit 8 Min. WOW!!",

With the sauce I don't think there was a noticeable difference in flavor. But I decided to indulge in a little pasta with butter & parmesan and could taste a subtle flavor. I do the same thing by adding marinara sauce to the pasta water.",
