                "reviewBody": "While I find this recipe very good in theory or concept (or I wouldn\u2019t have chosen it in the first place), in my mind it has a couple of obvious flaws.  I loved the idea of soaking the chicken in buttermilk, particularly with its additions of fresh garlic and bay leaves.  I also loved the idea of coating the chicken in both Parmesan cheese and potato flakes.  Where I had the problem was with the garlic powder and paprika \u2013 well, frankly, with the Parmesan and flour too, but that\u2019s a much smaller issue. To use the same amounts of paprika and garlic powder as you do Parmesan and flour just seems like\u2026a misprint?  A typo?  This can\u2019t be right.  I used a good sprinkling of each, nowhere near a full tablespoon of each.  And while you need a lot less paprika and garlic powder, you need a good deal more Parmesan and flour to coat all these chicken pieces (I cut mine in about 1\u201d strips).    I placed the coated chicken strips on a cookie sheet lightly greased with cooking spray.  I drizzled them with melted butter and baked them at 400 degrees, about 15 minutes, turning them once about half way through. I served them with barbecue sauce and ranch dressing on the side for dipping.  Very, very good \u2013 but with the above-mentioned adjustments.",

I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts which I prefer because they are not as dry typically.  Pretty quick and easy!  I'd say it took about 15 minutes to do 6 chicken thighs... if that long and it crisped up nice and tan.  I did put them on a rack on top of a cookie sheet and this kept them from getting soggy on the bottom side.",
