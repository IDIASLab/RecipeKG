Also added a small amount of red onion and a shake of red pepper flakes (sorry I don't always measure). Served it over rice (1/2 cup each) point of this is that the two of us ate it all -- it wouldn't have made enough for 4 and we're not really big eaters so you may think of increasing the recipe. But--maybe we ate more because it's so good. Lorry",
