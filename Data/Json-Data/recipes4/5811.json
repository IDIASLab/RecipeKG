I however added 1 can of corn drained and 1/2 c of parmesan cheese and 1/2 small onion an hour left. I did not cube the chicken n left whole. Afterwards yes was very oily but anyone who knows mayonnaise is made up of oil. So I drained most of the oil n sauce into my food straps outside dog dish. Severed over egg noodles. We loved it. Will make again. Thank you for sharing something different.",
