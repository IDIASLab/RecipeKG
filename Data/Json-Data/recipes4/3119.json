I admit, the name caught my eye because I'm from Grand Rapids, same place President Ford grew up and was laid to rest. So I figured I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did! First of all, I love the prep - it's very simple. I could sprinkle the seasonings on the meat on the cutting board, and saved myself the hassle of having to dirty more dishes. I'm a huge fan of cooked onions, and found two onions to be perfectly appropriate. I did let them cook a bit longer than 5 minutes.\n\nI used Merlot in place of Burgundy, and 2 cubes beef boullion dissolved in 1 cup water in place of the consomme (because that's what I had on hand). Still close enough to the original. I also left them to simmer a bit longer than it stated, just because I knew my meat was pretty tough in the first place.\n\nI took the first bite and almost melted. The beef WAS fork-tender! Delicious flavor all the way through. I removed the meat and onions, and added some cornstarch that I'd whisked into cold water, brought the liquids back to a simmer, and ended up with DIVINE gravy. All in all, an excellent meal that brought back fond memories of my childhood.",

We served it over egg noodles the first night and my hubby raved aboout the sauce. We had it over mashed potatoes the second night and it was just a s good. Don't waste your money on expensive burgandy. I used the P. Mason jug wine and it was great--even for my husband the wine snob. Be sure to use Consumme and NOT Boullion.

Also, I season the flour I'm using to dredge the steaks with thyme, garlic and onion powder rather than season the steak. However I do lightly season steak with kosher salt and pepper before coating in the flour. (Kosher salt is a lot milder and won't overkill the gravy)  Once steak is done take it out of the pan strain the fat out and put it back on the stove medium-low heat until it bubbles. Slowly stir in a mixture of 2 tsp flour to 1/3 cup cold water. Stir into gravy mix until thickened.  Great over mashed potatos!",

I added some Worchestershire sauce minced garlic salt and a bit more thyme to the sauce and that seemed to perk it up. This was okay really just mediocre. We ate it but no one was wowed. I don't think I'll be making it again. Sorry but thanks for the post.",
