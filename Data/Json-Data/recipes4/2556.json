Also the raisins didn't give it that something crunchy I was looking for but rather were an unpleasant chewy ingredient. So for my second try I omitted the cookies and raisins and added redskin spanish peanuts. It was a hit! The peanuts added the crunch that I was looking for and the salt was a good contrast to all of the sweet. This will definately be a new fall must have treat!",

You could really pick and choose all kinds of ingredients to put in it and do different seasonal color schemes. For me the candy corn is going to be kept to a minimum just for how pretty it is because the chewiness isn't the best with the other ingredients. I laid waxed paper on a baking sheet and spread my ingredients over that then once my candy corn was sprinkled over the top I pressed down with another sheet of waxed paper to embed all the bits into the white chocolate and waited till it was chilled to peel off the paper. It's a really pretty snack and hard to stop nibbling on despite how sweet it is.",

I used paper liners then dropped in a mini oreo pretzel pieces and raisins. I used my smallest cookie scoop to pour over the white coating. Then I pressed in 2 candy corns pieces. These turned out so good and it was really easy. Now they are all individually wrapped treats. Love the chewy raisins and the salty pretzels. This candy has it all. Great fun Halloween recipe!",

I made a second batch with chocolate flavored bark and just broke the cookies into quarters. This worked MUCH better. (I will try this again with the white bark.) I omitted the raisins and the flavor was really good. Great fall gift/recipe. Also kudos to Meredith for a beautiful photo.",
