Be carefull not to put the breading on the roast over the same pan you are roasting in. The loose bread mixture falls in the pan and becomes very hard while cooking. You don't want it in your gravy. I had to pick these out before I made gravy so I will know better next time. Definitely make when you want to impress someone!",

The crust was great but 150 degrees put the meat in medium-well range. Overall the meat came out juicy. One thing I also like to share is the term for the meat: A Rib roast and Ribeye Roast are the same cut of meat except the Rib roast typically has bones and the Ribeye roast is boneless.",
