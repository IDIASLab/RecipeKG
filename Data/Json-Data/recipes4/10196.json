I only had about 1/4 tsp vanilla extract left so that's all I used. I blended the tofu in a food processor with the liqueur. Then I added the chocolate melted with all the other ingredients. I blended until it was REALLY smooth. I refrigerated the whole thing for 4 hours. Thanks!",

It's true that it tastes funny if you eat it right away. Make sure to give it plenty of time to chill. I'd say 24 hours would be ideal. Then top with some whipped cream and oh boy! We had the bowl licked clean. My husband is suggesting increasing the chocolate content a bit and I agree. I also took the suggestion of adding 3 tbsp of sugar to the original recipe.
