The chicken finished cooking in the oven. I also used the Pepperidge Farm stuffing and I used the whole bag. (14 oz or so. There is no seasoning mix with the bagged variety. I added the TINIEST bit of poultry seasoning to mine and stirred well.) Be sure to use extra broth. (I used the whole can.) As others have stated--it IS necessary to cover for most of the baking time. I uncovered for the last 15 minutes. Just as good with less cheese. I also used reduced-fat soups and couldn't tell the difference.",

I used reduced sodium broth and 1/2 of a 14oz bag Pepperidge Farms herb stuffing( no seasoning bag comes with this).I still thought it was way to salty. I'm not an expert but it seems to me that the saltiness was coming from the herb seasoning. Next time I will use plain stuffing and if you use herb seasoning packet try using only half of it.Maybe this would help in cutting back on the saltiness of this. I made with some frozen chopped spinach and put some sauce on top and it was wonderful. I bet it would be good on potatoes too.I will make again with these changes and hope it helps because it really is a tasty dish.Thanks Stephanie!",

I just didn't see any need to boil the chicken prior to cooking in the oven & it came out just fine. I also did not cook in strips; instead I cut up the chicken into cube sized pieces. It wasn't as salty as the other reviewers suggested since I used a low sodium chicken broth. However next time I think that I will also use a low sodium cream of chicken & low sodium cream of mushroom (I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of celery soup). I will definitely make this again!! Thanks Stephanie!!!",
