So when I added all the ingredients it looked like it needed a little water.  So I added about a cup of water because it was really thick. But all and all I loved it.  Very tender and taste was great according to my husband. I didn't have time to do low for 8 hours so I pumped up the heat about 3 hours on high and then low and it still came out great. Will add more water next time. Gravy thick but husband loved it",
