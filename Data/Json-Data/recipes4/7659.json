I used ground turkey and almond meal, but I am giving you alternative suggestions below. This is a great paleo recipe and very addictive. I like using an ice cream scoop so they are all the same size! Perfect for entertaining. Yummy!",

I'm not sure if I didn't use enough eggplant, but I could barely taste it (a positive in my son's book).  I might use more next time.  I just put all of the veggies in my food processor to start (after roasting the eggplant) and then added the meat, bread crumbs with herbs (I didn't have almond flour) and egg, pulsed, and done.  So easy.   This was a great way to use up our eggplant, thank you!",

I saut\u00e9ed onions and garlic, added half to the meatballs and used the other half to boost the flavor on the bottled sauce I was using.  I included the Parmesan cheese and used Italian-flavored panko breadcrumbs instead of almond flour.  I let the roasted, scooped eggplant sit in a colander while I prepared the rest of the ingredients, which got rid of a lot of liquid.  Once everything was mixed I cooked a small amount to check the seasoning.  This led me to add some red pepper flakes and a little more basil.  I formed the meatballs by hand, which was easy and made them round and pretty.  While they were baking I added mushrooms to the saucepan, added the bottled sauce and tweaked the seasonings.  The baked meatballs were added to the sauce, where they simmered until my guests arrived.  A couple of notes - I only made one half-sheet of meatballs.   The little left over made a great burger for me the next day.  I only used one bottle of sauce, but a lot was soaked up by the meatballs.  Next time I will add more.  My guests raved over the food.  There were only three of us, but I had very few leftovers.",
