For the potaotes I cubed and microwaved for about 8 minutes to soften. For the sauce started with a jar of Boston Market turkey gravy and to this added a package of Knorr roasted turkey gravy mix and 2 cups of water. Actually still had to use a little cornstarch to thicken. Poured this into a casserole dish and put this into a 400 degree oven till bubbly. Once bubbly I took it out and place a sheet of puff pastry over the top and baked an additional 15 minutes.",

First off I made my own pastry crust using a basic 1 1/3 C flour 3T shortening 5T butter and 4T water and salt. For those reviews which used store bought crust the homemade will add much more flavor. It's a lot easier than some people think. I increased the chicken to 2 C and used 1/2 of a bag of mixed veggies instead of fresh carrots and celery. And I only added one potato because the bag of potatoes I recently bought are really large. After reading reviews about blandness and dryness I increased the butter flour and milk by 50% for extra gravy. Next time I will double it because I like more gravy. I also added fresh thyme for additional flavor. It was delicious! If it had more gravy it would have been 5 stars. I will modify the next time for sure then it will be perfect.",

My suggestions to make it easier to do: 1) deal with the crust after having made the filling; it's best to let it cool a bit 2) add the turkey to the first skillet and make the gravy by itself.

                "reviewBody": "i made a few substitutions to this recipe. i'm not sure if that affected the flavor because overall i felt this really was kind of bland. I used califlower in place of potatoes and a can of chicken broth in place of the water and bullion. i'm not a big salt person but i added more than called for and i still felt it needed something. i will try this again but will add more seasoning to it. i did prebake the bottom crust as someone else suggested. I recommend this.",
