I enjoyed the flavor combination made by the asparagus and sesame oil. The prawns were probably the least interesting because of the other aspects of the dish (but still good!). I used Kikkoman Teriyaki Sauce and Marinade but I would suggest using a low sodium teriyaki sauce. With a few minor changes I would definitely make this again. It's a perfect recipe for those busy nights!",

I sauteed it lightly in organic ghee turmeric salt and ginger. I poured in organic coconut water instead of water. Added the organic coconut milk Cooked rice. It was deliciously decadent and fluffy. Then I roasted tender organic asparagus and broccolini and cut them up over the rice. I used delicate tender boneless bbq pork ribs. I cooked the veggies and pork while the rice was cooking. Sprinkled with sesame seeds and tiny slices of organic spring onions. It was so delicious. It can be paired with chicken seafood beef pork.... such a great a versatile recipe. A good tip is to prep everything before starting the cooking process so that it is all ready at the same time and you can eat it all hot.",
