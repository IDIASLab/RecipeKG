I used the large link sausages and cut them in thirds and added potatoes and carrots with garlic powder, salt, pepper and oregano to add flavor. I also used a 1/2 bag of 15 bean soup and a 1/2 bag of black eyed peas and let it cook on low for 10 hours and sausage cooked just fine. Very tasty!",

I thought for sure that the 5 bouillon cubes and pound of sausage would make this extremely salty but if fact it was quite the opposite. I make a lot of soup and I never could put my finger on what this was lacking. Adding herbs would be a must if I ever attempted this again and I think using chicken broth in place of the cubes and water might have helped too. This was super simple and I think it has potential but it definitely needs some tweaking in my opinion.",
