This is great as is!\" There is a comparable recipe on here for a spiced applesauce in the slow-cooker that calls for sugar, so make that if you want the extra sweetness, otherwise, this recipe is just perfect the way it's written! The only thing that I did was add about 1/2\" of water at the start, and ohhhgosh after a little while, the smell was wonderful. Ran my immersion blender through it to serve to the baby, and I had mine straight from the crockpot warm w/ some plain Greek yogurt and a sprinkle of granola. GOOD STUFF, thanks Cookingfor7!",

I dumped a bunch of apple chunks (not thinly sliced, but peeled, quartered, cored, then quarters cut in half or third) in a slow cooker, sprinkled on spices, and walked away.  I didn't use the full measure of spices (probably used less), but the slow cooking strengthens them so much that it didn't matter.  Also, the no-water thing was a leap of faith, but it was perfect!  No burning, just apples releasing their own juices to be cooked down.  And, yes, a whisk really is all you need to break up the apples when they are done cooking.  Thank you!",
