Namely after combining the liquids with the flour and mixing it never forms into dough. It remains a highly viscous and sticky goo. Now I know that it should firm up if you mix it but no amount of mixing seems to fix this. I end up having to add another 1.5 or so cups of flour in order to get it to form dough. But then the bread ends up being quite dense (which may or may not suit your taste). Maybe this recipe is only for bread machines?? It doesn't seem to work well if you try to make it by hand.",

While we won't be making it again if you do make it don't worry about how gooey and viscous the dough is (others have commented on their concerns about this). Adding more flour would make it far too stiff to eat (it already leans in that direction). If you let it stay gooey it bakes fine. I used a bread machine and at first it appeared to be gooing up the bread pan without any hope of adhering as a loaf but then it balled right up.",
