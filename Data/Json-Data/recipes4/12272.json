I cooked it in the oven as we served 6. One note when you triple the recipe (6 servings) there is NO need to triple the sauce - I can't imagine anything with 1/3 cup of fresh ginger - yikes! And nearly 4 cups of liquid - unnecessary. Use your judgement. But we enjoyed it both times.",

I did turn the fish over and finished cooking under the broiler. I did add 1tbsp each of fish sauce and reduced sodium soy sauce. Even though my hubby is not a fan of cilantro I was able to convince him it is good and it lends a bright green color to the dish. The kids weren't as impressed but the older one ate his plate clean. I liked the crunchiness of the cabbage too.",
