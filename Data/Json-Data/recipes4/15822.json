The only big difference between this recipe and mine is that I use homemade tomato sauce and it just doesn't get better than that!",

I halved the recipe but I floured it as written crumbed it as written and then just melted a little fontina cheese on the chicken in the pan. I thought the chicken needed a little more moisture than just the tablespoon of oil that it called for so I did add a little Italian salad dressing to the chicken before adding the cheese. We had this with a good dinner salad and it was perfect for us tonight. Thank you so very much Janice Tofuri! The chicken was superb!",
