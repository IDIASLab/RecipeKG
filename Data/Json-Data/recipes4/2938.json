So I came up with this easy recipe myself a few years ago.  It's bursting with flavor and has become a comfort food staple in our home.  Use plain or Italian bread crumbs. We like it with a Caesar salad and garlic mashed potatoes.",

Next time I will cook it to 155 as I like it a little rarer.The flavors were great regardless.",
