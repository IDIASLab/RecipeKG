We thought this pancake recipe was GREAT--we loved it. NO leftovers. Great way to use random overripe bananas.",

The OJ taste overpowers the other flavors so I would dilute the OJ (1/2 OJ and 1/2 water as another reviewer suggested). Also I didn't get much coconut flavor and I added the full 1/4 cup as called for--maybe I'll try using sweetened coconut flakes or coconut extract next time as I was really hoping to get nice coconut flavor. As written three stars is appropriate but the above changes would certainly put these pancakes into my family's rotation of weekend treats. Thanks for sharing your recipe!",
