The frozen dough is so easy to usr,I roll it up like a jelly roll cut slits in it and bake at 350 for 30 min. Thanks for sharing!",

Next time, we will probably substitute pepperoni for the ham and add a little bit of Alfredo for some extra moisture to balance out the crunchy shell.\n\n\n--UPDATE--\nAfter making this countless times, Hubby and I finally have figured out exactly what works for us.  We always make extra, too, since the leftovers are outstanding.  I prefer to fill mine with shredded mozzarella, salami, and turkey pepperoni.  Hubby fills his with shredded mozzarella, salami, pepperoni, and Italian chicken sausage. Really, you can't mess this up and you can make it however you want.",
