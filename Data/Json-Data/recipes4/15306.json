My vegetables cooked in 10 minutes I used 1 tsp of Better than Bouillon in place of stock cubes. I made the sauce w/1 TBSP each of olive oil and butter before baking I sprinkled the top with a few TBSP of panko crumbs that had been mixed with a drizzle of olive oil. I baked the casserole in a 7X11 pyrex dish for just under 20 minutes. Make sure you drain the cabbage and carrots really well before placing in the baking dish as they hold a lot of water. I put mine in a large wire strainer and pressed out any remaining liquid with the back of a serving spoon.",
