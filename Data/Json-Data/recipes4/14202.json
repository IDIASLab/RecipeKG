I was concerned about the rum flavoring being too much but everything came out perfect! I used a bundt pan and the cake turned out nice and moist (I did have problems getting it out of the pan but I think I should have waited for it to cool a little longer before trying.) The frosting is very yummy. A little tip: if you forget to thaw the whip cream like I did, an electric wisk works wonders. I also used a little extra toasted coconuts on top. Very excellent recipe. It's rare that I find one that I don't feel the need to alter very much.",

Over the last 4 years I can't tell you how many times people have asked for my coconut pineapple cake recipe. I just refer them to your recipe. This is the best cake I have ever had. I make it as a 2 layer cake sometimes for special occasions and the only thing I change is to double the frosting recipe and sprinkle unsweetened coconut mixed with sweetened coconut all over the outside. It keeps it from being too sweet. There has never been a single bite left on a plate and it sold at a charity dessert auction for over 450 just a month ago. I froze the cake after I frosted it so it would keep on the dessert table until time to serve. It is still the most asked for recipe I have.",

It's not possible to find an 18.25 ounce box of cake mix so I used a 16.25 ounce box and cut the oil to 1/4 cup. I added dark rum instead of the extract. I thought it was perfect but a couple of the people said they couldn't taste the pineapple. Next time I may add crushed pineapple to the icing. This time I used a 13 x 9 pan but it would make a beautiful layer cake. And maybe I would put the crushed pineapple between the layers.",
