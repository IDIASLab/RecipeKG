However, if you have left-over egg mixture...add the left-over bread crumb mixture to it and cook it in the frying pan after the chops are done. When mixing the two together, you need a slightly pourable consistency, so adjust accordingly, more milk or more bread crumbs as needed.  Once it's in the pan, just spread it out a bit with your spatula. Let it cook for a few minutes and then, using your spatula, cut it into 'pie wedges' and flip over and finish cooking till it's lightly browned.  Serve it on the platter with your chops.    My mom and her mom before her never wasted anything. My 6 brothers and sisters and I grew up loving it, as did my 4 children and their friends.  Just a nice little side dish, especially if you don't have a lot of meat to go around. Mom just called it 'egg and cracker'. (...and yes, I'm sure it's probably not the healthiest side dish, just thought I'd offer it up as an alternative to dumping it all down the sink)",

Perfect every time. I use this same method for oven fried chicken. No oil required and use Egg Beaters instead of eggs. I also dredged the chops in flour then egg then breadcrumbs. I also added fresh parsley instead of green dried confetti. You can also substitute Italian breadcrumbs for panko and it makes for extra crispy crust.",

These came out just as advertised but I should have read more of the reviews and went with 1 less egg and half of the bread crumbs (although it did make it quick and easy to bread with all of those crumbs!)  I did transfer to a glass casserole for baking and easy table presentation.  Might add ground rosemary next time.  The 2 T. olive oil probably could have been 3-4 T.  They did come out looking picture perfect though and hub must've complimented them more than anything else I've made (and I cook a lot).
