This was so simple but the end result was bursting with flavor and tasted as if I had fussed over it for hours. There is only two of us and I was worried that the leftovers would be soggy but I was worried for nothing. The chicken held its crispness and lunch the next day was just as good. I plan on making this often. We enjoyed this very much Howard. Thanks for sharing!",

I just have to say I ate every bite of this reheating leftovers twice after the original cooking date and it was even fabulous reheated!!! This will definitely be a regular \"go-to\" in my house! My husband loved it too and he is not the easiest to please. I highly recommend it!!!!",

They worked out great and I don't think it changed the texture or taste too much. Also used olive oil to saut\u00e9 chicken and veggies since we have lactose issues. Butter would have added more flavor but it was still really good. It was a little bland but that might have been because of the changes. I will make this again since my husband and I both enjoyed it. Maybe add more salt and more spices. Thanks for the recipe. We really enjoyed it!",
