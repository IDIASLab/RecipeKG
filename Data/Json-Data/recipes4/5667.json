I was not at all sure why the oil was necessary but used about half of it anyway. I skipped using the high setting on my slow cooker and instead cooked this for 7 hours on low. The meat was tender flaked easily and was still very moist. Our plans changed for that evening so before shredding it I placed it in the refrigerator until the next day. When I took it out to shred I saw that a lot of fat had risen to the top and congealed so I removed as much of it as I could. I didn t return the shredded meat to the slow cooker because there was so much liquid remaining with the vegetables that I would have ended up with stew. I drained as much liquid from the veggies as I could but still ended up serving them on the side. We had this wrapped in a tortilla along with shredded lettuce sour cream and salsa. I also served Mexican Rice III (very good) also from this site as a side. This was good and I liked the hint of lime flavor but next time I would eliminate the oil using only enough to sear the meat. And I would also skip the beef broth perhaps replacing it with some bouillon granules.",

After several failed attempts to find a restarant that can make it I took to the kitchen myself. I was afraid between the jalapeno chili powder and cumin that this would be too spicy but that turned out not to be the case. I followed the recipe to the letter only omitting the oil and it was AMAZING! Putting the meat back in the slow cooker after shredding it is a must. Letting it cook in all those juices after shredding it really makes it special. I had a lot of juice in the crock pot in the end so i just pulled the meat out with tongs to serve in burritos and then used a slotted spoon to remove the left overs. We've used this several ways...burritos tacos nachos...always amazing!",

I wasn't sure what some reviewers meant by \"didn't taste very Mexican.\" The large amounts of cumin and oregano are tell tale signs that this dish is going to taste authentic. I know some people expect Mexican to taste one certain way but that's like expecting bacon wrapped little smokies and boxed mac and cheese to share the same flavor profile since they are both American junkfood right? Also this dish is supposed to be soupy whenever you get it at a restaurant the beef is making the tortilla or bun soggy from all the tomatoes and peppers and onions and beef drippings.",

I almost shouldn't rate this because I used a bottom round roast but then thought I'd let everyone know it won't shred like a chuck roast will. I had to slice it instead of shredding after six hours and then put it back into the liquid on warm for about another 30 minutes. However other than just rubbing the roast with olive oil I followed the recipe and the flavor was wonderful. My meat was still so tender and although not real Mexican tasting it was very flavorful and juicy. We made tacos and my sons made flour tortilla wraps. You will need a slotted spoon to scoop out your meat though a whole lot of liquid in the pot. I liked the cooked veggies on my taco. I'll probably try this one again maybe up the spice some for more Mexican flavor. Thanks FireGuysWife.",
