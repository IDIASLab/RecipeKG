After waiting over 45 minutes for my RV oven to \"heat up\" and getting a headache from the propane, I decided on Plan B.\n\nI took the cheese mix, folded in the potatoes and put the entire concoction into a slow cooker. I figured at this point I had nothing to lose. I cooked it on high for about 1 hour and then changed the setting to low and left for about 2 hours. I checked it upon my return, and low and behold, I had a dish that was respectable for the RV community potluck. I added the parmesan cheese about 20 minutes prior to completing the cooking. People enjoyed this casserole.\n\nI had some leftover \"sauce\" that I folded into some additional frozen potatoes and made latkes. They were especially yummy! \n\nThe moral of the story...when your oven is on the fritz, don't be afraid to drag out the slow cooker!",
