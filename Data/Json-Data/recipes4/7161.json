I chose to make a potato crust rather than use a pie crust and I assembled it all the night before (partaking the potato crust first) for an effortless breakfast the next day. I used a steam able bag of frozen broccoli which made assembling even easier. The directions don't say when to add the cheese; I'm assuming you should add it w/the broccoli/ham mixture as it didn't work so well added to the egg mixture. I had to bake mine a bit longer since it'd been refrigerated. THANKS for the recipe!",

I added a little more Swiss cheese on the top and sprinkled the remaining paprika over it. I baked in a 9\" deep pie plate. Cooked about an hour and let stand about 10 minutes.
