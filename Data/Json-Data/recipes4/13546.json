For the beans I used one can of chili beans in hot sauce and two cans of chili beans in medium sauce. I topped the chili with cheddar cheese chopped red onions and avocado. My boyfriend must have told me he loved this chili more than 20 times this weekend. It was spicy enough to tingle the taste buds and leave a little burn but not melt your taste buds hot. Perfect.

In fact my grown son, a fine cook in his own right, still says I make the best chili (go figure, I don\u2019t like chili and I never taste when I cook).  That said, this is some of the best chili I don\u2019t like that I\u2019ve ever eaten!  Ok, I changed it up, but I only did so in a big way with the heat factor, cutting back drastically on all things hot because of Hubs\u2019 sensitive innards \u2013 but the truth is I don\u2019t enjoy food that makes my throat and lips burn either.   So that meant no cayenne or habanero, and just a teensy bit of jalapeno.  I guess it was essentially \u201csissy chili\u201d but we loved it.  While I cut back on the heat I increased the beer!  I made half a recipe, which meant I only needed half a beer.  I don\u2019t like beer so I wasn\u2019t about to drink it but I didn\u2019t want it to go to waste either, so it all went in the pot!  I used all beef, no pork, and adjusted the tomatoes, sauce, paste and water to get the consistency I wanted.   I also threw in a can of kidney beans.  Except for the beer and the cornmeal, this isn\u2019t vastly different from how I make my chili, but then I don\u2019t \u201csimmer at least two hours\u201d and \u201crefrigerate overnight\u201d before I serve it.  I can\u2019t put my finger on what it is exactly, but this chili really comes together like no other \u2013 not too hot, tomato-y or chili powder-y, just a perfect chili with lots of body and character.  (COULD it be the beer?)",
