After browning the pork on the stove top, I put it in the slow cooker. I deglazed the pan with the liquids, including a splash of white wine, and poured that into the slow cooker. I added extra juice to cover the meat. 45 minutes before serving, I added cubed potato, slivered onion and chopped tomato (20 minutes before serving). I thought this made the dish more authentic when compared to our local Peruvian restaurant.",

The larger pieces makes browning the meat go faster. I'm not even sure browning adds that much. Second I used cider vinegar and cut down the orange juice by a third the second time I cooked it giving it a more mellow and lass acidic flavor. Third and this was special: This last time when the meat was tender (and before thickening the sauce) I removed the meat from the pan put the liquid through a fat separator added enough water to bring it to 4 cups brought it to a boil added 2 cups well-rinsed basmati rice cooked the rice until nearly done and returned the meat to the pan to re-heat. The rice was a beautiful color and had great flavor with one less pan to clean. Serve with plain yogurt if desired. Broccoli or cauliflower make good side dishes.",

Before adding the o.j. and water to the skillet however I first poured it into the bag to capture remaining spices etc. I didn't find the liquid to be too much OR too little. Added vegetables as others suggested including larger chunks of fresh zucchini. Since I browned the meat in an oven-proof skillet I just slow-baked it (325 degree oven) right in the skillet for two hours; adding the veggies midway. Personally I loved the flavor the sauce and the addition of veggies. Will definitely make this again!",
