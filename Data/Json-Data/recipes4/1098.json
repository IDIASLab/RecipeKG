I never made it much less ate it before, so I came on allrecipes in search of some help.  This got huge raves from my hubby he told me he was so spoiled by this that he could never go back to the can hash again.\r\nThank you so much for a super easy recipe.  I did add a lil more broth, the potatoes just sucked it right up but other then that i stuck to the recipe.  This is a keeper for sure and a great way to use up that left over corned beef.",

As an added bounus, I scooped out small portions from the frying pan and placed them on my griddle(which I had bacon cooking on), forming \"squares\" to fit my spatular. No grease, oil, butter, etc. Crisping then flipping them after about 2 min. or so. It gave them a more hash brown texture and the kids loved them! Thanks for sharing the recipe.",

I probably had about a pound of corned beef but only used 2 large (they were big) potatoes and the entire 14 oz can of beef broth. Chopped up a medium sized yellow onion. I let it cook for 15 minutes covered then took the cover off for about another 15 so it could get a little crispy and cook out the liquid. Served with over easy eggs on top. Delicious! This fed 4 adults with good sized portions. Thanks!",
