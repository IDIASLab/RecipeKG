I followed the recipe exactly except that I used chicken pieces (bone in skin on for moister chicken) and omitted the potatoes. I doubled the recipe as I was feeding 10 people. The result was pretty disappointing. When the chicken cooks it releases its fats and they collect in the bottom of the pan. Had I had the potatoes in there they might have absorbed some of the grease. As it was I scooped the veggies in there (as directed by the recipe) and immediately regretted it so I scooped them out and continued to keep them separate. Even so they were not crispy and delicious but rather too oily. We love roasted veggies but I usually spread them out on a cookie sheet so they can crisp up. Maybe if I had not doubled the recipe it would have worked better? I would say I would try again for just us but when I served the leftovers (nobody went back for seconds) to my husband later his comment was \"Don't bother to make this again.\" What a shame. It looked delicious.",

I am not really proficient at cutting up my own chicken but I did the best I could. I followed the recipe pretty well---didn't use fingerlings but rather diced red potato. And I didn't use all the vegetables called for because this was just for two of us. Otherwise I cut up an organic Costco chicken and marinated it for four hours. I think I should have used more salt and pepper but somehow I didn't see that until the chicken was ready to bake. I thought the marinade could have used some. I also think that when I make it again I'll use less olive oil and cut up the garlic to add to the chicken while marinating it. So there are a few changes necessary for my taste but this was really a good idea. I will use this again! Thank you so much Risa! I'll look forward to our leftovers!",

Plus I had limited ingredients since this was a last minute meal and I didn't want to go to the store nor did I want to take all the extra steps so I threw everything together and cooked all at once. It turned out great!I I used only 1/2 the olive oil but all the spices juice and garlic which I added to the mixture for marinading along with a tablespoon of soy sauce just to spice it up a bit. I marinaded 2 chicken breasts and one onion for a little over an hour. I then put all the other ingredients (sliced up regular potatoes one onion and broccoli along with the marinated chicken (which I then chopped into 1 X 2\" pieces) and onion into a glass baking dish covered with tin foil and put it on our smoker set at 350 for 35 minutes (I didn't want to use the oven since it's so hot outside). It turned out great although the chicken was a bit overcooked so I could have probably put it in for 10 minutes less. My husband and I both loved it and would make it again!",

I only marinated the chicken and potatoes (including shallots) separately then baked them in my large cast iron pan together. I had dark bone in meat and boneless breasts so I let the dark meat cook with the potatoes 30 minutes longer. than the breasts (which were in for 30 minutes). I did NOT add herbs/olive oil to the other veg (just a little coconut oil and garlic salt for cooking). The other veg I roasted in a 9x13 pan. I also did not add the lime as we do not like citrus in our main course. I loved that my prep could be done ahead of time then the cooking was being done while I was spending time with my guests.
