Mixed that together then poured it into the casserole dish and covered w/ cheese and baked 20-25 minutes. After tasting I really should've cut the chilies in half you could hardly taste the awesome flavor of the enchilada sauce. My friends that ate it loved it they agreed that had I not added the enchilada sauce it really woul've been missing something. One friend also suggested halving the amount of chilies and chopping up the olives better rather than just putting them in as is from the can.",

I just cooked the rice (with organic chicken broth instead of water) and I just mixed up the cooked rice with the chilies the monterey jack cheese and olives. I poured the mixture in the baking dish and just sprinkled the cheddar over the top and baked it. This was good but not quite there for me. I think this would have been have been good with some fresh minced garlic fresh chopped onion and maybe some cumin? Maybe half tomato juice or tomato sauce in place of some of the sour cream? It needs a little somethin'-somethin'. My littlest ate the heck out of this even with the olives so that was a win in my book.",

I think if you like things without a lot of spice or seasoning you would like this as is. Based on this recipe I would give it a 3. With it as a starting point - I made it a second time cooking the rice in chicken broth and adding cumin and chili powder while cooking. After it was cooked instead of layering I mixed the sour cream green chilies monterey jack olives 1 can mexicorn and 3 green onions. Topped with the cheddar and baked according to directions. I think it is a great starting point. Try it as is and then adjust to your taste. Thanks Kristina!",
