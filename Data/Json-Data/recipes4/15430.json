If you don't have a metal tea-ball or herb bag, you can seal the peppercorn in a piece of cheesecloth tied with some kitchen twine. This way we get all of the pepper and none of the hassle. Keep noodles and soup separate until serving. If you mix the noodles in with the broth, they will get soggy and overcooked.  If you have leftovers, store the noodles and soup separate or make a new batch of noodles the next day.",

Also we add 1 peeled kohlrabi or 1/4 cabbage. Caution with the number of carrots or the soup will be too sweet. We included 2 stalks of celery (whole) 1 whole tomato 1 green pepper - seeded 1 whole onion and 3 cloves of garlic. We also discovered that even the type of stockpot will make a difference. Enamel works best. Cook the chicken for an hour and then add the vegies for the second hour. Also once it's brought to a boil turn to simmer. You don't want it to boil too long or this will result in a cloudy soup. It should be as clear as possible. Agreed do not cook noodles or even reheat with soup. Do them separately. Best with homemade noodles. Strain soup once it's done and serve the chicken carrots and celery as a second course.",
