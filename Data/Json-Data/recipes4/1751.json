The tips I have for this recipe: 1) A standard 14oz carton of tofu fits into an 8\"x8\" pan if the tofu is cut into 3 thin slices instead of 4. I also cut each of the 3 slices into 8 triangles. 2) The sauce is enough to cover two things of 14oz tofu. Either use twice as much tofu or make this sauce all at once and use half of it (and the rest later) or use the \"customize this recipe\" feature at the bottom of the main page to change it to 2 servings from 4. 3) Start 2/3 to 1 dry cup of brown rice when the tofu is draining and then make the sauce then bake this and it will all end at the same time. 4) Brocolli. This is soooo good with brocolli.",

I would definitely use two cakes of tofu with his recipe. I typically, based on what is in my house, substitute parsley for the cilantro and use a tablespoon of ketchup plus a teaspoon of liquid smoke for the dried chilies. I also find that the amount of oil is unnecessary. I use 1 tablespoon of each oil, and have excellent results.  I also flip the tofu over a bit past halfway when baking.  I usually brown these again in a dry skillet before serving.   Lastly, make this recipe, you will enjoy it!!",

I used light soy sauce and did not use any canola oil in an effort to reduce fat. I used jar minced ginger and added in a teaspoon of jarred chilli and forgot the cilantro. (still tasted great will try with it next time)I prepared the tofu per the recipe and with no time for marinating just put it in the oven for 30 mins. After baking there was plenty of sauce (I didn't take out any as suggested)I tipped the tofu and sauce in a wok with some frozen stir fry vegetable mix coooked it all together and then served it over rice. Everyone loved it. The aromas from cooking made everyones mouth water. This recipe is set to be a regular at our place. Thanks for the recipe Meaghan it has great asian inspired flavours.",

That was really tasty and the brocolli came out perfectly tender-crisp. The sauce is excellent and tastes even better the next day. Thanks for the recipe.",

I would also recommend marinating it overnight and baking the tofu without having liquid in the pan. It will come out firmer which I think is better for tofu. Baking as stated in the recipe the tofu came out too soft for my liking. I thickened the remaining marinade with cornstarch for a nice sauce to serve at the table.",
