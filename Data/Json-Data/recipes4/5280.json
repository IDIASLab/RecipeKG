This photo is the second day - microwave heated, tasted better with age. I'd heard about using eggplant instead of pasta to 'enhance' health component and shave a few calories. What a great deal eggplant turns out to be - this summer I'm growing a couple of eggplants in our garden after using eggplant on this! I did 'mostly' this recipe, it was a great hit. Reading review I passed on the ketchup. The leftovers were even better than the first day - and the second day it held together \u2013 totally.  This is wonderful- so good. :)",
