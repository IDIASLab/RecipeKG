You need to add probably 3/4 c. ketchup to the meat, or add cheese.  Instead of covering the top of the cornbread part with the shredded cheddar, next time I will probably add the cheese into the meat mixture.  We doused ours in ketchup to eat it.  I will try again, because the flavor was really good (I doubled the onion and salt).",

I only made one change (well besides following the instructions from the other comments about putting the cheese directly on top of the ground beef) I used green chiles instead of jalapenos - wasn't quite as spicy as it could have been. We served it with sour cream - I think we'll add a bed of lettuce next time. I'm also wondering if I reduce the amount of ground beef and substitute some refried beans if the flavor would change drastically or if it would just help hold the bottom together a little more. My daughter wasn't crazy about the corn bread part (but she's not a bread eater) but loved the meat. Oh and instead of using a boxed mix of corn bread I mixed up 1/2 of a batch of \"Homesteader Cornbread\" (it's another favorite recipe of ours from allrecipes) and poured that on top - absolutely delish!! Thank you for your wonderful creation!",
