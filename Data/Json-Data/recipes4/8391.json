I can't get fresh chicken sausage in my area and subbed with Italian Sausage (used 1 lb ground turkey 1/2 lb italian sausage) omitted the egg and milk due to dietary restrictions but the meatballs held up fine and were not dry or falling apart. The smell of the meat mixture seemed slightly off to me and I added a tad more basil and parsley (dried as that's what I had on hand; flavor of chicken sausage varies and my italian sausage was weak in seasonings). Really enjoyed these in comparison to straight turkey meatballs. The sausage seems to add the lack of fat along with additional flavor whereas straight ground turkey meatballs tends to be on the dry side and requires more seasoning. I added these meatballs to Basic Marinara for the Instant Pot by Bren and it was an excellent spaghetti and meatballs dinner! Will use these going forward for turkey meatballs! Thanks for the recipe Olivia!",
