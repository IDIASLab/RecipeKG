I think next time I make it I'll use a different type of pasta----maybe thin spaghetti or linguine. Last time I made it I put it in the slow cooker for a work potluck and it was better than baked. I didn't cook the noodles and put it on high for 3 hours. Much creamier than baking.",

However I would STRONGLY recommend the following substitutions: - reduced fat cream cheese for \"processed cheese food\" - light margarine for butter - fat free 1/2 and 1/2 for the regular - add green onions! Additionally I didn't bake the dish. I didn't see the point and it would (I assume) dry out a FABULOUS dish. I also substituted red bell pepper for green (based on what I had around). The above substitutions greatly reduce the \"guilt\" of this \"guilty pleasure\" without sacrificing ANY taste! I don't really see how the processed cheese food would work in this recipe but cream cheese makes it so decadent! I just had to put it up in my fridge to stop eating it! A",
