I've made it many times, always testing as I go and depending on my mood, I adjust the heat by using \"mild/medium or hot\" salsa which is key to if it would be bland or spicy, those spices count.  Great technique for me so I can keep dried beans stored yet still get a fix for a sudden craving!  It's a technique with dried beans you could use in many more circumstances.  I just cooked until thick - on my particular stove, that was 20 minutes.  As many stoves, salsas and beans and quality of spices as there are in the world, try to be fair or informative regarding recipes.",

I made a bulk batch here it is: (9 cups of bean flour 3 TBSP salt(I used 6) 3 TBSP ground cumin and 3 TBSP chili powder. Stir until well blended and store. Preparation instructions: place 1 1/2 cup bean flour and 3 1/4 cups of water into a medium sauce pan. Bring mixture to a boil over medium heat and cook until thick about 15 minutes. When desired consistency remove from heat and add 1 cup salsa stir and serve. Yield approx 3 cups. When I use this to make bean dip I also chop up pickled jalapenos into it as well as a little of the jalapeno juice. Yummy! Thank you so much for this time saving tasty recipe.",

I have to admit I have found some new ideas I hadn't thought of before. Then I found this particular recipe. I was so excited I had to try it out right away never mind that dinner is already done and eaten. I am truly hoping that this will turn out great. It would be great when I am short on beans and someone drops in. If it turns out I will be sure to share it with all of my friends and relatives. Although the beans are not done yet they are not grainy. I think the problem for the cook who said the beans just would not get done is old beans. Old beans will not cook up well. Try buying the beans at a store that has a high turnover rate.An area with a high Mexican population would be good especially at a Mexican store. They turned out great. I will definitly use this again. Try adding a small amount of garlic and onion for even more flavor.",
