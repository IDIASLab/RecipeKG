I used about 1.5 pounds of ground beef, 3/4 of a diced onion, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup bread crumbs, @ 3 teaspoons of diced garlic, 1 teaspoon italian seasoning, salt, pepper, a little onion powder and a little seasoning salt.  I baked them for 25 mins on a broiler pan so the fat would drip off.\n\nOnce I added the meatballs to the sauce (I originally made a half batch of sauce since I only made 1.5 lbs of meat) I decided I wanted more sauce so added another can of cream of celery and then added 2 beef bullion cubes and about half a packet of dry onion soup mix since I didn't have any more canned onion soup.  I also added one soup can full of water.  I cooked the whole pot on high for about 3.5 hours on high and it was really delicious.  The only thing we felt it needed was more salt.\n\nWe'll most definitely have this again.",

I cut the recipe in half (makes a LOT!) used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery and I didn't make it in my crockpot. I boiled the noodles put the meatballs in the microwave and threw all the other stuff in a pot on the stove to heat through. When it was all done I just mixed everything together. The crockpot would have worked great but I didn't want to wait...I'm terrible about last minute meals what can I say?! It ended up being SUPER quick and tasted great! My husband said \"needs more mushrooms but it's really good!\" It's a really tasty stroganoff. YUMMM!! I think it's a keeper!",

Removed and drained.  For sauce used 1 can cream of mushroom, 1/2 envelope dry onion soup mix, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 cup milk.  Heated through added meatballs and served over buttered egg noodles.  Good flavor, similar to stroganoff",
