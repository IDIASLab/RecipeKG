During last hour I sprinkled a package of onion soup mix over all and let simmer more until the soup mix had diffused into the dish. This turned out delicious. I didn't thicken the sauce that was left in the pan--just ended up spooning out the cabbage and pork chops onto plates and throwing the juices that were left away. Thickening the sauce just didn't sound good to me. But the pork chops were extremely tender and whole dish was really delicious. Thanks for an excellent starting recipe.",
