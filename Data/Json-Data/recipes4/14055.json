I tried so many shrimp and grits recipes trying to get the right one and then voila Natasha brought this jem of a recipe into my life. It has been the rave of every dinner engagement I've brought it too. For the sake of time and access to ingredients I have made a few modifications: 1) I use chicken and beef stock instead of veal (still delicious) 2) I boil down the shrimp shells in a little water and make my own broth to add to the mix 3) I don't bake the grits. Nor do I add eggs to them. One of these days however I would like to try it.",

Someone mentioned that they did not \"have any clarified butter\" Huh? You MAKE clarified butter. I don't think you can buy it but who knows. You just melt the butter and skim off the milk solids and what you have left is clarified butter. It does not burn easily when you clarify it cause milk solids are what burn. Wonderful!
