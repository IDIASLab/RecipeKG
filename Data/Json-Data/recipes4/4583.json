                "reviewBody": "I've tried a couple of biscuit recipes that use buttermilk baking mix and they were excellent.  What I found, however, by making THIS recipe is that the mix doesn't really shave any time off the preparation nor is the process necessarily simplified. These biscuits were mixed and on the baking sheet in no time.  I wanted the freshness and color of green onion, so I chose to use that instead of the dried minced onion.  I found I needed more buttermilk to bring the dough together, so since I had none left I used cream.  They were perfectly baked and golden brown at 12 minutes.  Once out of the oven I brushed them with melted garlic butter which gave them a boost of flavor as well as an attractive sheen.  The Parmesan is a distinct flavor in the biscuits, so the title is just a little misleading.  If you don't like Parmesan, you're not likely to care for these biscuits.  They're SO pretty - very inviting.  I appreciated their larger size compared to other drop biscuit recipes.  They\u2019re crusty on the outside, buttery and moist on the inside.  Flavorful and just delicious. They\u2019re just what I was after to accompany our soup tonight and I\u2019m looking forward to enjoying one with some scrambled eggs in the morning too.",

I mixed and dropped the batter onto a parchment sheet. They baked up in 12 minutes leaving behind a wonderful cheddar aroma. The first thing I noticed were the pretty speckles of green onions with the yellow cheddar cheese baked in all over the biscuits. The biscuits feel light and airy to the touch and are a lovely golden color! They are moist tender and very cheesy-just the way we like our biscuits! I could also taste the parmesan reggiano. I think these biscuits turned out just right not too salty or dry. Flavorful and delicious! This went nicely with \"Beef Barley Vegetable Soup \" also from this website. I also think these biscuits would complement a bowl of hearty beef stew or chili.",

I also made six large biscuits instead of 12 small (baking time and temp. was the same).  These were great- the only thing I thought was maybe they could use more salt, but I recommend following the recipe the first time and deciding for yourself.",

They came out pretty but I wonder if that could have been part of the reason they weren't full in flavor. Will definitely make again but will try with the dried onion and see what happens. I also might add a little Old Bay Seasoning next time for added flavor. 11/26/11 update: I just made these a 2nd time because I had green onion and sharp cheddar that I wanted to use up. This time around I added more cheddar a little more onion and a dash of season salt. This batch was much more flavorful! Definitely 5 stars with those changes.",
