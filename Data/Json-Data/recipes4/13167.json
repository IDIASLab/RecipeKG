We aren't EVEN going to like this. TOO limey!\"  But I went ahead and served it anyway, hoping for the best - and hoping I had enough other food in case we couldn't eat this.  But to my surprise, not only did *I* like it, but Hubs did too!  It's obvious this rice is much better served *with* something, in this case carnitas. They were perfect together!  The amount of lime juice and zest ended up being just right, but I know the full amount of cilantro would have dominated to a fault - glad I cut it back to a fraction of what the recipe called for.",

Boil for about 17mins, then remove from heat, remove lid also...put a dish towel on top and return lid...allow it to sit for about 10mins...this makes sure the rice is fluffy because the towel absorbs the excess steam...after it sits, then stir in your cilantro and fresh lime juice to taste...for my family its usually 1 to 1.5 limes....this has saved me from buying cilantro rice from Qudoba every other day for my 2yr old!

I started with melting the butter, then saut\u00e9ed 1/2 of an onion and 2 cloves garlic for about 5 minutes, added in the rice and cooked for 3-5 minutes, then added in chicken broth (instead of the water called for), and seasoned with salt and pepper to taste. Then cooked it according to the rice's package directions. And last I added in lime zest, lime juice, and cilantro just before serving. I did increase the lime juice to 3 tbsp, because we like limes in our household. Overall an amazing and delicious rice recipe that makes a wonderful side and is so flavorful!",
