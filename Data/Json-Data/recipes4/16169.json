I subbed ground beef for stew beef as that was what I had on hand, olive oil instead of vegetable out of habit, didn't have canned figs so I used fresh/dried, also didn't have red wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar. Overall, my family & I really enjoyed it. It was a little too sweet for my personal taste but that can be fixed pretty easily. I fully intend to make this again as it is well worth the time put in.",

It was a bit sweet, so I'll cut the honey in half next time (and save a few calories).\n\nI don't know what serving size you are using, but I'm using about 12 oz for a serving size and according to websites for recipes, the calorie count is actually about half of what this recipe states, so they either use high calorie dense foods or double their serving size.",
