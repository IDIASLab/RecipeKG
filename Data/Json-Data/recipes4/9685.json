I added some celery and chicken base, cooked the potatoes in 6 cups of water and added 2 cups of skim milk in place of the last 2 cups of water right before I stirred in the rub noodles. Hubby ate three huge bowls full and wouldn't let me throw away the dab of soup left in the kettle; plans on eating it for lunch today. A good 'old school\" potato soup and a definite winner.
