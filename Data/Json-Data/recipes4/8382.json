Everything else was the same. I took other reviewers advice and cooked them at 325 for 25 since I was doing 2 consecutive batches.  They're quite light and held their shape nicely.  They cooked perfectly golden brown on the edges and bottom.  Great recipe if you're looking for something different and lower carb.",
