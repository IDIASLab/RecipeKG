I decided to try and make vegan pancakes with protein powder instead and they actually turned out surprisingly delicious! You can use any flavor of protein powder too: I've tried vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate so far. Strawberry and chocolate have been my favorites! Tastes delicious with a hot cup of tea or coffee or even with a chilled glass of almond milk!",
