I have a whole box of Candy Cane Cocoa (which is what I usually keep around or mint cocoa) so I figured that would be perfect for this. I did about 1/2 a shot of the peppermint schnapps since the cocoa was already minty and 1 1/2 oz of Kahlua and it was GREAT! I couldn't taste the liquor in it at all! This is going to be a regular winter drink for me! Thanks!",
