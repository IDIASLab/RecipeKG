I didn't need a full 1/4 cup of olive oil for cooking the veggies and used the same pot. 1/4 cup just isn't very much of each vegetable and so I used whole small bell peppers 1 small sweet onion and a good 1/2 cup or more of mushrooms chopped and fresh minced garlic and oregano. I'm glad I did or I think the tomato taste would have over powered the dish. That said this was a very nice tasting shrimp dish had the nice Italian flavoring and yet a spicy zing to it. I did omit the salt since I watch my salt intake. I think some feta cheese would make a nice addition to the dish.",
