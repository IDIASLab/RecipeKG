I made this exactly as written aside from omitting the red peppers because I didn't have any and adding in a few cloves of whole garlic. I used hot Italian sausage. My little guy wiped his plate clean, and so did we, lol! This is a definate 10 star recipe that I will be making VERY OFTEN! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Followed the recipe with the exception of using 1 each of green, red, yellow and orange peppers and threw in a couple of carrots I needed to use up. I also did not peel the new red potatoes.  A couple of the kids and I don't usually care for spicey (hot), so I used 1 pound of sweet itialian and 1 pound of hot italian sausage. This was the perfect blend for us.  I also threw in a little fresh thyme and fresh parsley right before putting it in the oven. It did take apporox. 40 min in my oven.  This is definately a recipe that will be a reapeat here. Everyone loved it and said they are looking forward to having it again soon. Thanks for sharing!!",

Instead of wine I used beer(Im so used to it with sausage and was too lazy to get a bottle of wine :P ) and i doubled the chicken stock. I also added cajun seasoning and garlic salt as well as about 4 cloves of garlic.  it was delicious! the potatoes came out PERFECT and very soft, the sausage had great flavor. im not even a big pepper fan but i absolutely loved them this time around. will DEFINITELY make this again!",

The potatoes were perfect (I was skeptical). I put a lid on the peppers and onions which helped to soften them quickly.  I cannot tell you how good and flavorful this came out.  There were only 2 of us and we ate almost the entire dish ourselves.  I'm eating the leftovers-not sharing!  :)  Thank you submitter.",
