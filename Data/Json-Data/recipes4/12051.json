I have never bought jarred sauce before so picking one was a challegene. We like hot & spicy foods so we used hot picante sauce. I used spaghetti noodles insted of rice and shredded grilled chicken on top instead of cooking it in the sauce. Now that I have this recipe maybe we will eat spaghetti more often. Enjoy.",
