And yes, it is extremely fattening (although this really does end up being more than 4 servings).  A few things: I don't undertand why it says to cook the chicken for 30 mins...I think the adding watert and cooking the chicken step can me totally omitted(this recipe does not take nearly as long as it says). The cream cheese and butter don't blend well, I was worried I had done something wrong, but adding the cream completely remedied the problem.  Also, more chicken is definitely neccesary to give more substance. I might try lamb next time. A decadent meal...but certainly worth the (very rare) treat.",

Instead I used 1/2 cup of cream and 1/2 cup of whole milk. As a last-minute decision I steamed some broccoli chopped it and added it in as well. The outcome was fabulous! Definitely a five star dish. The garlic white pepper and cayenne was especially nice on the chicken. Believe it or not it gets away with five cloves of garlic and tastes just right. Hubby couldn't believe it when I told him there were five cloves in it. Alright I think I better go do some stomach crunches now. (yeah right.)",

Even with all the modifications this was still very good. After dousing this with pepper at the table I realized I couldn't taste the saffron so I would avoid adding additional pepper. I served this over vegetable pasta to mitigate the unhealthyness of the sauce. If I made this again I would cut back on the cream cheese and possibly add some extra half and half or milk to make this sauce a little thinner.",
