I think that made a difference in this recipe because with dried pasta it was dry. The only other thing I did differently was to use dried parsley rather than fresh. The flavors in this were really good but I think that I will have to add some kind of liquid to make this good for my family. I will try it again using the correct pasta because it is worth the flavors! Thank you richlor!",
