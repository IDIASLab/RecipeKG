Then I used bacon instead of hamhocks because I had bacon on hand. I also used a box of chicken stock and some water with chicken bouillon instead of just plain water for extra flavor. And then towards the end I added a tablespoon of butter for a savory flavor. I also omitted the okra because that's not what I had on hand. However note that if you use okra it will thicken the mixture up a lot as okra is a natural thickening agent.",
