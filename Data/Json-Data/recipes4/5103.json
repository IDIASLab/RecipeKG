I made it as written only using low-fat cottage cheese and light sour cream. My son took most of the leftovers back to school with him.

I was curious being with Weight Watchers and I can say it was definitely a waste of points how many I don't have a clue I didn't eat much of it and will have to throw it out. I have come to the conclusion that the only way to have this is with the full fat ingredients low fat and fat free do not do this justice. The best recipe on this site \"Moms' baked macaroni and cheese\" is hands down the best!! I will just have to go back to that one and have it only occasionally. Oh well live and learn!",
