I tried it anyways and we loved the combination. I halved the recipe and it made more than enough for the 3 meals for my husband and I. That's a good thing now he has lunches this week! We did not find the meat the least bit spicy despite the chipotle peppers and adobo sauce. When serving I layered the shells shredded lettuce the meat mixture cheese tomatoes avocado sour cream and a squeeze of fresh lime juice. A wonderful meal that will be a great summer addition to our menu when feeding a lot of people at the lake. Thanks cookingmakesmesmile for sharing your recipe. This was a very good recipe group pick this week.",

I only used 3 chipotle peppers and added a small jar of roasted sweet peppers. Next time I'll substitute all chipotle for roasted sweet red peppers. 4 stars for adults and fail for kids.",

The inclusion of chopped potatoes gave it an additional texture and taste that we both enjoyed. We added cheese salsa and sour cream on top. I only wish I had avocados to add to the meal. Next time I will! I had a bit left for the next day and served in a warmed soft flour tortilla. It was good too. Thanks for the recipe I will definitely make it again.",

I chose this recipe because tostadas are one of my favorite Mexican comfort food and bring me back memories of my childhood in Mexico. Johnsonville's mild Italian sausage was perfect for this.I only used half of a tablespoon of olive oil as the sausage can be oily and sauteed some garlic as well with the onions and potatoes. I didn't need to season the meat because it is spicy enough as it is. I substituted the chipotle peppers for the chipotle sauce that comes in a can which is much milder. I spread some re-fried beans on top of the tostada and used lettuce red onion sour cream Mexican crumbling fresh cheese the sausage with potatoes and avocado as toppings. It was really good!!",
