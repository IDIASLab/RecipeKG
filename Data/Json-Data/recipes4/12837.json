I sauteed the pork in the pan first and then removed it...then made the sauce in the same pan so I could use all the little bits of flavor stuck to the bottom.  I cooked the mushrooms first, added flour to the mushrooms to cook for a bit (to get rid of the \"floury\" taste).  Then added the wet ingredients.  I then added the pork to the pan again for about 10 minutes to cook in the sauce to reheat.  Turned out really well.  Thanks for the post.",
