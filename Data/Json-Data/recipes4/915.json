I added some Tyme and ground pepper for a bit more flavour and used some mozzarella with the cheddar cheese. I also COVERED it to bake it then removed the foil for last 10 minutes and broiled to brown the top. Very good recipe.",

I guess it's a matter of \"to each his own \" but I thought it was WAY too rich (and I love rich foods) WAY too salty and even the smell of it made me sick. It was just too ooey and gross for me. My boyfriend felt bad that I hated it though because he loved it so much and wanted me to make it for him again! He had 2 huge helpings! Maybe I'll try it again but with garlic powder not garlic salt and I'll add some sort of veggie like asparagus or broccoli to absorb all the goo. Good luck to whoever tries it - it's definitely a hit or miss recipe.",

After reading other reviews regarding the strong onion flavor I tried using 3 Tbls. of dried minced onion soaked in an equal amount of cold water to reconstitue. (2 T. dried minced is normally equal to 1/3 c. fresh minced or 1 med. onion chopped) Then I added it to the soup mixture after sqeezing out the excess water. This worked very well for two reasons. Because of the minced size it seemed to distribute throughout the dish well; and it made the lesser amount of onion enough to add flavor without being overwhelming.",
