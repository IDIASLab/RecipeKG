But since the ingredients seemed simple and it WAS after all a Moms group I decided to try it. They LOVED it. Everyone absolutely RAVED about it! I couldn't believe it...and every person INCLUDING my husband who snuck into the kitchen for the goodies went back for seconds! I did use 4 eggs and 3 cups of cheese as others had suggested and it worked out perfectly. I have already given out the recipe to friends and will use this recipe often myself!",

The next morning, I pretty much cooked the tater tots fully (maybe 5 mins. short of full cooking time) and put them in a 9x13 pan as a base.  I crumbled the sausage over tots and poured the 2 cups of milk and 6 egg mixture over everything.  I finished it off with 3 handfulls of cheese.  Cooked for 40ish minutes to a nice goldern brown.  It came out FABULOUS!  The tots \"melted\" together and came out very much like hash browns with eggs, sausage and cheese on top.  The extra extra eggs gives it much more flavor and makes it more substantial.  Season to taste.  Will be giving up the bread version of this as the tots give much better flavor!
