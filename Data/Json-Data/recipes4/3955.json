At first he looked at it and said \"what is this?\". I told him what was in it and he just made a face. Well after he took a couple bites that all changed. I was so surprised that he liked it so much. Actually he has asked me to make it on a regular basis. So I would recommend this reciepe to everyone. It may seem like a werid group of ingredients but man is it good. The only thing I did change was I put half of the amount of chili pepper and subsituted the other half of it with smoked paprika. (just because I have terrible acid reflux) Well it worked because I was able to eat it with no problems. Anyone who try's this recipe please rate it and comment. I'd love to see if everyone feels the same.",
