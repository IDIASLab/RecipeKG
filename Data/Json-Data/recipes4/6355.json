I increased the recipe to an entire pound of penne pasta increasing all the other ingredients as well but I was unsure if I had added enough dressing and not wanting to drown the delicious salad I decided to leave it as I made it and just put the dressing on the side so people could adjust as they wanted. It was 1/2 and 1/2 some liked it as I made it and others used the dressing like ketchup. No matter there was very little left at the end of the game and it was first picked to be taken home by my friends. A perfect salad for a football party.",
