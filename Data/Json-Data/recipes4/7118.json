Caramelize the cabbage,onions, and pepper in a larger pot using olive oil and slowly saute until transparent. This will bring out the natural sweetness of the cabbage. In another frying pan cook the bacon to desired doneness. Drain off the fat before adding bacon to the sauted vegetables.  Add just enough bacon drippings to flavor the dish. Sprinkle with a little Beau Monde Seasoning and serve. Full of flavor without the fat.",

One can add in shredded onions and sweet peppers as desired, a little bit of chopped fresh hot pepper or garlic, whatever seems to fit and the family or guests like.  I would do a bit of bacon in the microwave until crisp and then crumble it over the dish last thing.  It gives a nice finish and leaves out the a lories and fat in a whole pound of bacon.",
