I did make a few alterations to the original recipe:  I used 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth and water combined in place of the 2 cups of water.  I also heated the pecans in the oven a few minutes to give them a more nutty flavor.  It needed more salt added before serving to bring out all the flavors. Remember, brown rice has a short shelf life and should be kept in the freezer.  If this recipe doesn't turn out, your rice or your spices may be old.",
