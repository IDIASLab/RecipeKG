I guess I will have to change my recipe now.\r\n\r\nI only made half a recipe so instead of throwing away two half cans of soup I used only one can of Cream of Potato soup.  I also really liked the hint of dill in the backgroup.  I added a little extra cheese because I like my potatoes extra cheesey.  I thought they had great flavor and so did my husband obviously.  I will make again for sure.",

Bake as directed and be sure to check your potatoes at the one hour mark. Not all ovens bake the same so a quick check at one hour could save you from burnt potatoes. Once your potatoes are baked you will have a wonderful tasty side dish to please your family!",

Depends on the amount of hashbrowns you use. My favorite is cream of mushroom. I don't add too much milk or dried dill however I do add a pinch of cayenne pepper and some seasoning salt instead of regular salt. I also mix in a cup of grated sharp or old cheddar cheese into the hashbrown mix as well as a generous amount of cheese on the top. I have yet to come across any of my guests to complain about this dish. Usually I am asked for the recipe. By the way thanks Maureenburr for sharing your mum's recipe.
