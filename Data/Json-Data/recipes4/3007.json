It locks in the juices and flavor.You can use the broiler to do this. Add the drippings also to the Kraut. No garlic please !!!. You can grate an apple and add it to sweeten the Sauerkraut. Bayleafs (1 or 2) are a must and so are the pepper corns  and Karaway seeds. If the Sauerkraut is to vinegary, rinse it until you have the desired flavor or just simply add an extra can of water. Remember, the longer you cook it, the better the taste.   Every one loves my Sauerkraut...Happy cooking",

It's important to know how your crock pot cooks when it comes to cooking meat.  This particular recipe calls for an 8 \u2013 10hr cook time.  That works great if I\u2019m using my 30+yr old crock pot, but my 2yr old crock pot will have this done in 4 hours because it cooks 10x hotter than my old one.   If there is one thing you don\u2019t want to do, that is over cook a pork loin because it gets really, really dry if it\u2019s overcooked.  Another option to consider would be to use a pork butt roast.  It gets tender and juicy the longer it cooks and isn\u2019t as easy to overcook as a loin roast.",

This is the part I feel passionately about - DO NOT PUT THE KRAUT IN UNTIL CLOSE TO THE END. I hate kraut that's been pulverized to mush. I poured in the brine at the beginning of cooking putting in the kraut 1hr before the finish just until it warmed. The meat/potatoes do taste better after it's had time to sit with the kraut but you really don't want to cook it that long together. Things I feel less strongly about: Try fooling with the amount of caraway - I like it more subtle around 1t. Try a bit of apple cider vinegar to brighten it if you need. Try searing the meat before you put it in.",
