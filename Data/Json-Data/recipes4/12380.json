In order to make a rue with the right consistency, I used at least 6 tablespoons of drippings to the 2 tablespoons of flour.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe for milk and water.  The gravy cooked and thickened nicely.  I'm giving 3 stars only because I was in a hurry, and had I not saved any more drippings than the 2 tablespoons called for in the recipe, I'd have been in trouble!!  Will use recipe again, but more drippings.",
