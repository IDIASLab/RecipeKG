But even so the stew needed at least 1/3 a can of tomato paste for flavor as there wasn't a ton there and even though I tossed the lamb chunks in flour and browned them beforehand it really wasn't very thick. I think with modifications this could be a really nice recipe - the whiskey is a good background flavor.",

I cooked on high for four hours and then took out the shank and took the meat off and diced it. It put the bone back in the pot along with the meat. The flavor is in the bone. I use scotch because that is what I have and it is similar to Irish whiskey. We love this recipe and I will make it many more times.",
