I used boneless, skinless breasts, and watched the baking time closely.  It still took approximately 30 minutes, but they were done to perfection--crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside, with just the slightest hint of honey flavor.  I served them on a bed of spring greens and drizzled them with ranch dressing and served garlic crescent rolls on the side.  DELICIOUS!!  Next time I'm going to try this coating with catfish fillets on the stove top.  Thank you laurag, this is now in my permanent file.",

I used thin cut boneless chicken breasts but forgot to cut down on the cooking time and the chicken was a little dry. Next time I will use regular breasts so the chicken will remain juicy. The combination of honey and pecans imparts a slightly sweet flavor but it's not overly so. I served this with baked sweet potatoes and a spinach souffle found on this site and the combination of color and flavors went beautifully together. Good family weeknight meal.",
