I did make some substitutions/omissions based on what I had.  I used fresh kielbasa instead of the smoked, fully cooked kind because I was out (I think mild Italian sausage would probably also be great), and I also was out of potatoes.  I sauteed the onions and sausage in the oil, then added the carrots, and then the kale, before finally putting in the broth.  Once that came to a boil I added the macaroni and garlic (without letting it simmer 45 minutes), which was cooked in about 9 minutes, and lastly I added the beans.  So it ended up being a quick, delicious, nutritious soup, and my husband raved about it all evening.  We forgot about the parmesan, but I'd like to try that on it next time.",

Although I did make a couple minor changes, it did not alter the basic flavors that the creator intended, therefore the high rating.  Did cut back on the amount of pepper called for, no potatoes on hand so that was omitted, and finally thought a little additional flavor would enhance the broth so i added a small amount of dried crushed rosemary.  Will be using this one again for sure!",

It says one bunch of kale, but bunches can be quite big and it can overpower other ingredients. I would say use 3 big leaves of kale for this recipe and it would do it. I had to add more chicken broth to make it more soupy instead of a stew. Just use a little bit less kale. I am also put less noodles in this soup, I put half a cup of noodles instead of one cup. I totally omitted salt and put a little bit of pepper. Otherwise, it's very hearty and healthy soup.",
