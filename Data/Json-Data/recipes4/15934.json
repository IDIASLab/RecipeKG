I used 2 really large Fuji apples instead of the 3 listed in the recipe, and I added a teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  In my opinion this turned out way too soupy, next time I will reduce the amount of liquid to 3 cups (1/2 water & 1/2 apple juice) instead of the 4 cups of liquid stated in the recipe.  The flavor was very good; I don't think I will add the brown sugar next time either, I think the apple juice will give it enough sweetness.  I wanted it on the sweet side this first time to ensure my kids would eat it but next time I will leave out the addtional sugar.  They can always top it with some brown sugar or maple syrup when they eat it.  Plus the extra sugar made my blood sugar spike and I got real jittery mid-morning, nixing the sugar next time.  I sprayed my crockpot with cooking spray and had just a bit of sticking to contend with but nothing major, I had good results with this; will make again with a few tweeks.",

I used 1/2c of almond milk 1c of unsweetened apple juice and 1 3/4 cups of water with three Granny Smith apples cored chopped up and placed on top of the steel-cut oats mix. I also used a tablespoon of cinnamon. Set the Zojirushi cooker on porridge and set the timer for when you wake-up. If the mixture is too thick thin it with additional almond milk. There is enough for three to four portions depending on one's personal consumption. This is the best oatmeal I ever have had. My seven year-old son thought it wasn't his cup of tea.",
