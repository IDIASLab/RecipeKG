I had all the ingredients and was looking for a way to use the peppers up plus 1/2 lb. of sausage so this was perfect. I was also looking for a stuffed jalapeno recipe that didn't use cream cheese and wasn't deep fried so doubly perfect! The rolling out the sausage was a bit messy I ended up just pinching off sausage and molding around each pepper. My FIL said it was a 5 star (I asked him to rate 1-5 as I didn't want to eat any not that fond of stuffed peppers) he really liked the flavor of the sausage/spice combined with the jalapeno.",

I tried to \"healthify\" this with turkey sausage and made my own seasoned bread crumbs (not Shake'n'Bake--which is full of fat & chemicals). I just don't like handling slimy canned chiles so I used fresh chiles. I picked serranos because they're consistently spicy and I like the flavor better than jalapenos which are too vegetal for my taste. The chiles steamed inside the sausage which kept them fresh tasting and tender-crisp. Cheese was melty pleasure: Yum! Next time I'll make the crumbs less spicy so each layer will be a unique experience on the tongue. I'll make this for one item in an appetizer course--surrounded by healthier selections!--at my next dinner party.",
