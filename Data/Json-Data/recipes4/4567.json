Can taste the chocolate and peanut butter strongly.  I used pure maple syrup and really couldn't taste it.  Also I used semi-sweet baking chocolate squares instead of chips.  I also added a few handfuls of cashews to add a nice surprise.  I definitely will be making this again.  And for those without a double boiler I used a pot about half full of water and put a stainless steel mixing bowl on top of it.  That worked great.",

This may or may not be the best fudge in the world depending on your definition of fudge but it did what it was supposed to do. Only licking the cooled spoon silenced the chocolate craving monster until next time. I didn't find the maple syrup overwhelming at all. In fact you might really have to pay attention to discover it's there. Stir until everything is melted and combined. Pour in a dish and refrigerate. Couldn't be easier. A child could make it.

I mixed the ingredients well in a glass bowl and microwaved for one minute then removed it and stirred alot. I repeated that once more and it became a beautiful thick yet light creamy hot fudge. The dominant flavour was chocolate then peanut butter and I couldn't really tell it was maple syrup that gave it its sweetness but I did use 100% pure Canadian Maple syrup. I also used grated dark callebaut chocolate instead of chocolate chips. As a sauce it was delicious - hopefully I can wait the six hours to let it solidify.:) Update Once solid it is still delicious however I would not call it fudge. It is more like a soft chocolate square - kind of like the Moritz Icy Squares you can buy. Super yummy and super rich - so cut into small pieces.:)",
