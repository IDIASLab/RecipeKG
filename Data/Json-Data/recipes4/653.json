I simply mixed flour, garlic powder, salt and peper together and just floured the porkchops with that mixture, no eggs. Then I browned them in the shortening. While they were browning, I dumped 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of beef broth,  1 envelope of onion soup mix, and two 4 oz. cans of mushrooms in the slow cooker, and mixed it all up. After the porkchops were done browning (about 4 min. on each side), I added them to the slow cooker and covered them with the soup mixture, and let them cook for 5 hours on high. They were so tender and the taste was out of this world, the aroma filled the house. There were no extra spices needed. I served them with mashed potatos and corn. My kids loved them! I will definately make this again and again!",

Season with salt, pepper, season all, and little sage. Use 1 can cream mushroom and 1 can cream chicken, with the 2 cups milk. Serve over rice. Turns out perfect and my family loves the gravy over the rice. In fact I am making this tonight!!",

To drippings in pan saute 12 oz. sliced fresh mushrooms. Then add 1 can of cream of mushroom soup 1-1/2 cans of milk then 1 packet of onion soup mix. Mix ingredients and bring to boil then add to slow cooker. I used six thick boneless chops and had more than enough gravy. Fork tender no need for a knife.",

I found that the egg and flour coating gave the chops kind of a slimy \"skin\" - next time I'll just season the chops and brown them without the dredging step.  Also, instead of slicing I would chop the onion.....the slices in the gravy looked a little too worm like for me :)",
