                "reviewBody": "We liked this recipe but didn't love it. It had good overall flavor but each item by itself was by itself was bland. For instance the pasta was bland unless you had a piece of chicken or zucchini (unfortunately I had to sub Butternut squash for the zucchini) with it. The squash was plain unless you had a piece of chicken or pasta with it. And the chicken was bland unless you combined that with something as well. You get the idea. I think this can easily be a 5 star recipe with some additions. Definitely needs onions and garlic. I think broccoli in with the pasta would kick that up a notch. I think also having some cheese melt through the dish while baking would help a bunch too. I recommend this recipe with some of your own tastes added.",

I halved the ingredients to feed 3 peopIe that is 660ml of V8 vegetable juice if you can only buy it in litre cartons added a teaspoon of minced garlic to the pot and an extra pinch of ground coriander. Each of the 3 chicken breasts I sliced part way through and spread 1 teaspoon each of basic pesto and soft cheese mixed together into each cut placing the chicken breasts on top of all the other ingredients. Finally season each chicken breast and drizzle with olive oil. I cooked it all using a cast iron pot with lid for an hour. Most the liquid had been absorbed and the chicken breast was perfectly cooked. It was all very tasty. I would check it after 40 minutes and adjust the cooking time if necessary.",
