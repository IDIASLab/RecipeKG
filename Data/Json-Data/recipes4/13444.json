I also didn't use tomato sauce but tossed in a can of drained chopped tomatoes instead. I'm not a huge fan of rice so keep that in mind but this wasn't too bad. The flavors worked well and it goes well with chopped chicken to make it a full meal. This does make a lot of rice though--so make sure you like rice or have enough people to consume it if you make the full batch. There is way more than 5 servings in this recipe! All in all not bad and hubby seems to like it. Thanks for the recipe.",
