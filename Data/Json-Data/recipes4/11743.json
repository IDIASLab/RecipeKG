If you want more flavor -- I use chicken broth instead of water and canned El Pato sauce in my rice before I add the rest of the ingredients (the El Pato sauce doesn't really add a lot of liquid so keep on about the same proportions of liquid as before.) I've also noticed that the HOT rather than MEDIUM picante sauce makes it almost too spicy but you can scale up or down depending on your taste. Also add a little minced onions garlic and celery in the meat (hot pork sausage and/or ground beef) makes it really really good. I didn't use too much cheese on top at first but this is the best part. The kids also like this inside burritos. Great! UPDATE: I was out of Sour Cream so I used Ranch dressing -- not 8 ounces but just enough to get the creaminess through the mixture. Came out great and no one mentioned the difference.",
