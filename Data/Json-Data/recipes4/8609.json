The cheese is Locatelli (not Locatella), which is Pecorino Romano. I have also made it using regular sausage rather than Italian sausage. I should also add that I now make the sauce in the microwave, just keeping an eye on it until it starts to boil. Comes out fine and saves a lot of time.",

After making a few changes, it now rates *5* (according to the family).  Instead of 1 cup heavy cream, I used 1/2 cup of 2% milk and 1/2 cup of heavy cream.  I also used only 1/4 cup of butter.  (I made these changes for 2 reasons, one to reduce calories and the other to lighten the richness of the sauce). This turned out very creamy and light, but not heavy and rich!! No leftovers at my house.  Will definately make again",

Oh and then I added some scallions in with the parsley so I changed it up a bit but made it a bit healthier with the veggies.
