I use the plum tomato paste with a little sprinkle of italian seasoning and it so rocks. Also I give it a little parm cheese too. If I'm hungry I'll mix baby bella mushrooms with a drizzle of EVOO and a clove of minced garlic in a bowl and stick it in the microwave for about 30 seconds. I use the mushrooms & garlic for the inside and coat the outside with the remaining EVOO and WOW it's great. Fabulous recipe!!",
