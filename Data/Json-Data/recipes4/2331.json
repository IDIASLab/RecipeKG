I didn't use the preserves for fear that it would be too rich - instead I used fresh strawberries and whipped topping in the middle to hold it together. A warning for those considering making it - its really hard to remove the brownie from the pan and move it to make a layered cake. Still the combination of the dense brownie the light whipped toping and the fresh fruit was delicious. To make it more healthy I used apple sauce instead of oil in the brownies and light whipped topping. You can also buy sugar free brownie mix that tastes almost as good as regular with fewer calories. Highly recommended for chocolate and strawberry lovers.",
