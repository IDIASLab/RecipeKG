The broth is very flavorful - especially with the addition of the minced ginger and earthy mushrooms. I used bay scallops in this recipe and ended up adding more than just four scallops to each bowl. I would continue to make this recipe and maybe switch it up with some shrimp or sukiyaki-style sliced beef.",
