I did add more garlic and used soy sauce instead of 1/4 cup water but the broth before that was pretty tasty...just had to make it unique:). The cayenne gives it a bit of a kick but it was ok for all 4 of my kids. I have no idea what Squambo is supposed to taste like but I think it would be a good way to use up various fresh vegetables before they go bad. Yum!",
