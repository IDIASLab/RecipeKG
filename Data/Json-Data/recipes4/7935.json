There are the most healthy, delicious wraps you will ever taste! Use as tortillas or as a pasta/bread substitute in any meal. Fill with stew, meat, taco fillings, whatever is for dinner/lunch that would normally be served over/with pasta or bread.",

I followed the directions exactly and it came out VERY soft and sticky. Even after adding a lot of coconut flour I added arrowroot and tapioca starch. It was too late to delete an egg and I didn't want to waste an entire cauliflower. It was like 'rolling' out tapioca pudding and it certainly did not fry up crispy but soft and tender. It tasted great and we ate the pieces. I am going to try again and next time will drain the cauliflower very well and omit an egg. Dry frying did not work very well nor did adding oil.",

I baked it rather than pan frying it, so I was able to eliminate the need for flour. I spread the whole batter out on a parchment paper covered cookie sheet and baked it in a 400\u00b0 oven for 7 minutes, rotating the pan at 3 and 1/2 minutes. I found these wraps to be nice and flexible and I think this recipe is very amenable to seasoning different ways to get different flavors. I will definitely use this recipe again.",
