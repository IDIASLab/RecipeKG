First I cubed my chicken while slightly frozen, so it was easy to slice and would cook faster. Then I followed what the buliion label said for cubes to cups of water, which was 1 cube per cup of water. I also added 1 can of cream of chicken. I also cut up some carrots and threw them in then too. I let that all boil and cook. Then I added the noodles and let them cook as well. We dont like soups that are mainly broth so I added probable more noodles than most would as well as more chicken and carrots probably too. But my boyfriend is SUPER picky and he loved it. ",
