I used cans of corn, green beans, and potatoes since I didn't have mixed vegetables on hand. I loved how easy this was because you really didn't have to follow the measurements exactly, you can do it to your taste preferences. And since I had the broth the meat cooked in I didn't need any broth. I will make this again.",

I also used frozen vegetables instead of canned as I just don't use canned vegetables.  This is a good recipe to use up a dry roast.",

I adjusted it by using a can of corn and can of green beans but I only used about 3/4 cup of hickory bbq sauce. Be sure to include all of the liquid from the veggies. I only had chicken stock so I added beef cubes to it and cooked it on high for the full hour. I took the suggestion of serving over rice and it was awesome and just as good as leftover for lunch as well! I wouldn't have tried something like this on my own. Even my picky son liked it!",
