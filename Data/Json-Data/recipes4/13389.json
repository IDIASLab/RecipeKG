I just squirted the juice of 2 limes in and also added 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I didnt add any cheese.  This was just delicious and I bet its delicious as is - I just cant help myself and end up changing things around a bit ;-)  ETA:  I cooked the quinoa in veggie broth and added serrano and jalapeno pepper and some frozen sweet corn (just toss in the bowl frozen) - soooo good!

I added a chicken boullion to flavor the Quinoa itself and since other readers complained it was mushy I cooked it only the 20 minutes til it was al dente. The texture was perfect and seemed to be just as good the next day. I was out of garbanzo beans so I had to pass on that. I only had stems of cilantro left from dinner last night so I chopped those fine didn't have the cheese added avocado garlic onion and fresh tomatoes. It is really good! I would recommend people who are shy about trying Quinoa to use this recipe! And... it's good for you!",

I substituted black beans for the garbanzo beans and cheddar cheese for cotija, as I was unable to locate this cheese. I also use 2 fresh tomatoes in place of canned dices tomatoes. Adding some spice, such as chili powder and cumin and maybe some cayenne pepper make this a wonderful dish. Also, I recommend eating this hot as a full meal for 4. It is great in this fashion.",
