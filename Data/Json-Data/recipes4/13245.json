My dressing was well seasoned so I left out the onion, celery seed and garlic.  I also added a few tablespoons of homemade chicken broth over the dressing, a few pats of butter on top of the potatoes and a layer of frozen green beans (precooked in boiling water until almost done to make sure they would be fully cooked in the dish).  I usually get tired of leftovers after 2 or 3 days but looked forward to this at lunchtime for the whole week.  This one stays in my recipe file.",

Perhaps a little chicken broth added to the turkey mixture would have helped. Or maybe a layer of cranberry sauce between the potato and turkey layers???
