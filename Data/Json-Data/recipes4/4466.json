I also don't like vermouth so I used a dry white wine (a cheap sauvignon blanc). I followed the directions up to using the phyllo dough. I used a sheet of puff pastry instead and used toothpicks to hold the pastry together on top. After that I used a quick spray of Pam on the top and sprinkled rosemary on it. Next time I make this I will defnitely used the phyllo dough as the puff pastry did not brown enough/get flaky enough for me. It's delicious! Give it a try! All of the ladies at the potluck asked for the recipe.",
