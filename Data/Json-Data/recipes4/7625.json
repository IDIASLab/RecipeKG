My intent was to make this as a gluten free appetizer. I used imitation crab meat without reading the ingredients on the package. It contained wheat. I wanted them GF for a guest. Not the fault of the submitter of this recipe, it was my mistake. I will make this again as I really enjoyed this dip. It was even better the next day! My thanks to Janelle who submitted this recipe to Allrecipes.",
