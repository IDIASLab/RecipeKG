First, don't think of this as a substitution for mashed potatoes because you'll be disappointed.   You never can get mashed cauliflower the same texture as mashed potatoes.  However, this is a very nice cauliflower side dish, loaded with flavor.  We did add salt and pepper at the table, so I'd probably add that before baking next time, but other than that, wouldn't change a thing.  We're not vegetarians, but we enjoyed this vegetarian side dish!  Rachel, thanks for sharing!",
