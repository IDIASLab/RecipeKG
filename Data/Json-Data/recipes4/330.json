For better time approximation, it took at least 2 hrs. for the mixture to reach the simmering point (Step 2), and I found that the potatoes needed longer than 45 minutes to become tender (Step 3) (I cooked them for 1 1/2 hrs.)However, my Crockpot didn't have a \"medium\" setting, it only has \"high\" and \"low\", so this might have made the diference.

Here's something that I've found that takes it from \"okay-good\" to \"perfect\": add a very generous teaspoon of country Dijon mustard toward the end...when you are cooking the potatoes. Be sure to use new, or red or white potatoes; russets will fall apart with too much cooking or reheating. If using ham hocks (which are fatty) try cooking them alone (in the slow cooker), strain meat, keeping the broth, allow broth to cool and remove the fat on top. Now add cut ham pieces, potatoes and green beans to the broth in a large pot, and gently boil until beans & potatoes are tender. Ham slices are faster (cook at least two, cut in 1\" squares) less fatty and just as delicious, with less work than skimming fat from hocks. Which ever you choose, don't forget the country Dijon!
