                "reviewBody": "Actually the way you brew the coffee is also very important. I think 4 cups of water or half cups of coffee is too much water, 1 to 2 cups of water is enough. In Vietnam, we brew coffee in a tille tin coffee brewer that is placed right on top of a invididual glass that already had condensed milk in it. Glass holds iced coffee better than regular hot tea/coffee cup. You can use tall cup that look like glass. Literally, 4 glasses need 4 little brewers. Put 2 table spoon in each glass. Put 2 table spoons of coffee for each brewer and pour in hot water only double amount of the dried coffee or so. The very hot water abborbs into the coffee and droped down drop by drop slowly bring with it the deepest flavor. It should stop dropping when it has approximately equal the amount of condense milk; replace the brewer. Then you use a long spoon whipped the condense milk and black concentrated coffee liquid until they blend well together and you can smell its combination. Finally you pour ice on it(double the coffee and condensed milk combination). Stir the ice well until the ice melt that make the coffee become very cold and raise the coffee volumn up enough for you to \"drink\" it. You don't have to have the Vietnamese coffee brew, just remember to put very little water into the coffee. The more bitter the coffee drops the better. That's what make Vietnamese coffee style unique and special.\r\n",
