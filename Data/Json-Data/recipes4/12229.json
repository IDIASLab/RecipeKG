I will reduce the oil as someone else has suggested, and maybe add some diced tomatoes (personal preference- I put them on almost everything) *I would definitely recommend adding the salmon when the onions are just about done. Great alternative to corned beef hash :)",

I basically just saute onions and fry potatoes until softened and slightly crisp/golden brown. In parallel I fry two pieces of salmon (I don't use filets). As everything is frying I prep the sauce. I double the sauce recipe as I find that the original amount does not completely coat all of the ingredients. I've also recently substituted dried rosemary for fresh dill in the sauce as I was out of the latter. I found this to be even tastier (and less messy) than using dill which I did the first time I made it. Once the salmon is slightly fried to the point of being softened I allow it to cool for a few minutes and then mince the fish meat with a knife/my fingers removing any bones. I then combine potatoes onions and salmon in a big frying pan (by this point each is fully cooked) and allow it to fry for 5 mins mixing frequently. Two minutes before I am about to turn off the heat I pour on the sauce and mix thoroughly. Results are extremely delicious!",
