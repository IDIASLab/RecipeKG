I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it was really watery on the bottom after baking.  I will make again but will probably add another egg or two.",

I did find it a bit salty but that may be because we are not accustomed to eating American cheese. There was a little water at the bottom of the pan but not enough to concern me. I did only refrigerate for an hour before baking. Looking forward to leftovers for breakfast tomorrow:) Thanks for sharing your recipe Karen!",
