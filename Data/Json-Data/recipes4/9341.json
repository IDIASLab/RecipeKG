As for the frosting I use 2 boxes of pistachio instant pudding with 1 pint of heavy cream (whipped) 1 cup of milk and add a little almond extract to it.",

I didn't read the directions well and put the milk in the cake on top of the water so it was quite moist!!! But it turned out great. Follow the real directions and I'm sure you'll like it. It takes some TLC but it works! I am making one for Thanksgiving tomorrow by popular demand. Try it! I didn't think i'd like pistachio cake but it was wonderful! i made the pudding mix like the recipe said and let it set up for a bit then i folded in cool whip and let it set again for a bit. Then frosted the cake and refrigerated it. Patience paid off as it was the rave! Plano TX",
