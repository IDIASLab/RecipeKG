I served with a salad and biscuits and fed my family for 1.50/person. would definately make again since it is just pantry staple items. Can't beat that. I did season the chicken with s&p before dredging and then once on the baking sheet I got a little nervous about the simplicity of it all and sprinkled the chicken with seasoned salt paprika and garlic powder. It didn't have an overwhelming mustard flavor like I expected-which was nice. My crew was pleasantly surprised by this dish!",
