Suitable to make by hand or in your bread machine. I adapted this recipe from one I found online, while looking for bread recipes that use amaranth flour. Very good with butter and honey. Amaranth flour is available from Bob's Red Mill&reg;. Stores that have a decent selection of natural foods or natural markets should stock it.",
