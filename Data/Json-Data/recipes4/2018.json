Next time (probably this weekend) I'll pump up the spices a bit add some smoked habanero and maybe some cheese and finish them in the smoker at 200 for a few hours instead of the oven. Thanks to ND24 for the advice! After making this several times what works for us is: 1. Let the mixture cure for 3 days instead of one. Mix it each morning. It makes the texture even better. 2. I added two chopped smoked habanero peppers and a quarter cup of sharp shredded cheddar.",

I'm always looking for a new way to disguise deer meat but I've found that with many recipes I still can't \"fool\" myself. Not so with this one! The only substitution I made was deer meat for the ground. It came out perfect and I agree with other reviews it has WAY more flavor than the store bought. This will go in my permanent recipe collection. Definitely a keeper! We can't wait to see what happens when we add jalapenos and cheese!",
