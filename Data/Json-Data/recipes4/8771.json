Allrecipes.com tends to change the directions... anyway just simmer the asparagus in a skillet with 1/2\" water until tender. Sautee the onions and mushrooms together until they're both soft add seasonings and pour over asparagus on serving dish. Top with cheese.

During prep I browned a pat of butter in a saute pan stirred in a small amount of brown sugar until it was caramelized and sprinkled the mixture onto the pecans then roasted them on high heat in the oven for about five minutes. To balance the sweetness I threw in a VERY SMALL amount of powdered cayenne as well as a dash of crushed red peppers to the asparagus as I cooked it off. Remember a little sweet and a little spice go a long way in this dish. The final product went over VERY well with my guests.",

Do not try to use the pre-grated kind you can buy in the store (or worse yet the kind the the green can) - grate your own. If you don't then I wouldn't even bother making this. Also the sweetness of the parm is so good - I would not use pecorino. We grill asparagus at least 3x a week - great change to our nightly side dish. I used dried shitake mushroom and added some water to steam them in the pan after I sauteed them with butter. Other than that I followed it exactly and it came out great!",
