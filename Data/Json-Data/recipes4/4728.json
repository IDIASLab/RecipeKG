Don't be afraid to try it! It is so nice to find a recipe that uses so few ingredients and ones that I usually have on hand.",

I used chicken tenders and did reduce the catalina dressing to 8oz. b/c that's the way I make the oven version. The smell/taste of this always reminds me of and Asian-y or Chinese-y type of dish, so I served 'Asian Coconut Rice' and 'Garlic Broccoli\" (except used green beans), both from this site...a great match! Served the chicken and sauce over the rice~YUM! Loved that I was able to do this in the slow cooker and get the same results. A great new way for me to make this yummy chicken!
