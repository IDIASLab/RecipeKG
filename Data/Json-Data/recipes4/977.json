You can use either sweet or sour dough bread, both are tasty!  I will usually assemble the Cheesy Breads the morning of the party on cookie sheets and cover with plastic wrap and keep in the fridge.  When everyone has arrived at the party I just pop them in the oven and serve them piping hot!  If you don't want the bread to be crunchy, broil them instead of baking them.  I've tried them both ways and crunchy is better!",

I did have to add a little more mayo to make the mixture spreadable...using high-quality black olives, fresh green onions and the crustiest bread you can find.  Rather than slicing the bread into individual portions before baking, I usually cut the baguette lengthwise, bake it whole, and then cut it into bite-sized pieces after it comes out of the oven.\n\nUPDATE: 01/06/06- I still have to say that this is the most requested appetizer for every party that I attend.   People want to know if the cheesy bread will be there (regardless if we will be)!  1/2 a packet of ranch is really all you need (otherwise will be too salty)...definitely experiment with other toppings such as grilled chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, or even a spicy chipotle in adobo kick!  Yum.",
