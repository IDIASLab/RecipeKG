My modifications:\n-white cake mix\n-3T of cocoa \n-1 full oz of red coloring\n\nI chose to go with another frosting (Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site) because I prefer more of a dense cream cheese taste and texture.

My only experience with Red Velvet Cake is one lushious experience at the Claim Jumper Restaurant which prompted me to look for a recipe. I am an expert at knowing a delicious dessert when I taste one and this one is amazing! I added 4 Tbsp Cocoa as other reviewers suggested and 1 tsp vanilla extract. This was absolutely delicious. I did not use the frosting. Instead I made my own cream cheese frosting (1-8oz Cream Cheese 1 stick margarine 2 cups powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla). I made this for the office as cupcakes and also for my mother in law's birthday. Everyone raved about this and several wanted more than I had. I plan on making this for my niece's baby shower this weekend and can't wait to devour again. Thanks so much for a really easy amazing recipe.",
