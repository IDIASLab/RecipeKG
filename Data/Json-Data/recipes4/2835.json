                "reviewBody": "Absolutely the most addicting dip ever! I was skeptical that the ingredients would taste well together, and nothing more should be added (like bacon). Well, I used fresh parmesan, and it was perfect, better than cheddar. I tried adding bacon and it detracted from the taste. The dip was not mild, but not tearfully spicy either, so if you need it REALLY hot, doubling the jalepenos would suit you. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND using panko (Kikkoman makes a grocery-store version) crumbs on top of the parmesan (10/08 UPDATE TIP!!! MIX the 1/2 cup panko crumbs WITH your FRESH grated parmesan and sprinkle the mixture atop. It comes out SO crispy and golden, and prevents the cheese melting into a hard crust you can't scoop through. Perfect, perfect!); and you'll bake up a beautiful golden, crunchy coating -- that \"deep-fried\" taste! Do bake in the oven. Last but not least, the large crowds that have devoured this agree that the best DIPPER is TOASTED FRENCH BREAD slices (place on pan under the broiler for a couple *careful* minutes per side), distantly followed by butter crackers. Tortilla chips are the least favorite, and sourdough bread (my usual favorite) seemed too sharp to accentuate the dip. Hope that helps any questions YOU might have! =) ",

It does make the best \"popper\" flavor.  You just have to trust me.  In order to get the correct consistency, you have to stick to the recipe.  Do not substitute with sour cream and you must use the mayo.  The best presentation you can do is REAL shredded parmesan cheese on top, and bake it in the oven in a glass pie dish.  It comes out golden brown and gorgeous!  Mmmm...  Also, you'd think bacon would be great in this.  It's not.  Again, you just have to trust me.  People rate this recipe less than 5 stars when they add to it and that's not the recipe that I've shared.  Please stick to the recipe for the best results, and use the baked variation with real shredded parmesan cheese (not the green can stuff).  Enjoy!!!",

The dip had heat but no one said it was too hot for their taste buds. I also used shredded Cheddar cheese (1/2 in the cream cheese mixture and 1/2 sprinkled on top.) because that is more an ingredient in poppers than Parmesan. And because others suggested it I also sprinkled lightly with bread crumbs for that \"fried\" popper taste. Baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and served it with Tostito Scoops. This \"dip\" tasted exactly like jalapeno poppers. Try this you will not be disappointed.",
