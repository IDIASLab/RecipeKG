Also I'd never heard of sage sausage before this but it was right next to the other breakfast sausages so all the ingredients were easy to find.",

I LOVE LOVE LOVE (did I mention I love?) the slow cooker as it's cooking option. Definitely freed up oven space. I read a lot of reviews first and listen to the majority of the reviews and add the chicken broth 1 cup at a time when stirring (I checked on it every 45mins-1hr). I did end up using just about all of the stated cups of broth. I also added a can of sliced chestnuts. I was worried that the spices would be too overpowering NOPE. No one believed me this stuffing was NOT from a box:) DEFINITELY to be made again!!!",
