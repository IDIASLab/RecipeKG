I threw the steak in a pan with a little oil on the bottom and cooked it on both sides for about1-2 minutes on high heat just to quick brown it. Then I put it in the crock pot and added the 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of French Onion soup but did NOT add the can of water. I cut up a few slices of onion and spread them over the top. Cooked on high for 2 hours and 2 hours on low.  Then I put the gravey in a pan over medium high heat and sprinkled in a couple of tablespoons of flour to thicken. Awesome taste and meat fork tender.There is no way your meat can be dry or tough. This is fool proof. I made mashed potatos and put gravey over it too! If your meat is thicker and the top of it is exposed you might consider adding the water to it, but if it is thinner leave the water out. A much richer taste.  Either way you will probably want to thicken it up by whisking some flour into the gravey. Enjoy!",

All I had was regular steaks (not round) so I wasn't too sure how it would turn out, but it was just incredible!  I seasoned the steaks with pepper and garlic salt and then browned them in a little olive oil in a skillet.  Instead of cooking the steaks in the oven, I just simmered everything on the stove, covered, for an hour.  My steaks were not dry at all...so flavorful!!  I only had 2 steaks, so I used 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup, and 1 whole can of the french onion (no water), and added in a 4 oz can of sliced mushrooms.  I also added a bit of flour to the gravy at then end to thicken it up.  I mixed up some instant potatoes, microwaved some frozen veggies and had an incredibly easy, GOOD, and well-balanced meal.. .and the best part, I only put in about 5 minutes of active work.  I will definitley make this again and again when I'm looking for a good home cooked meal, but don't want to cook!!",

I used the slow cooker and the meat cooked over 8 hours. \r\nI only had a pound of round steak, I used cr. of mushroom and then Lipton Onion soup mix plus 2 cups of water. I also added about 1/2 cup of mushrooms. About 30 min before serving, I stirred in 3 tbl of flour dissolved in water. Served over mashed potatoes. This gravy was very flavorful and this seems to be a very budget wise meal. The gravy will be reused to serve over biscuits on the weekend. Thanks for the great recipe!!",
