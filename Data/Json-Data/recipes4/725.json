                "reviewBody": "Excellent, but this recipe can be made even easier.  (For other reviewers who are browning the meat - there's really no need. Since it's shredded, browning the meat doesn't add much to the flavor or color.)  I just put the pork in, even without salting it sometimes, then pour about 2/3 to a full bottle of BBQ sauce on top and cook on low for 6-8 hrs. or high for 4-5 hrs.  Adding the beef broth just makes it soupy and the pork gives off a lot of juice while cooking anyway. BBQ sauce alone can tenderize the pork perfectly.  And I tried with and without coffee and it made no difference in flavor or tenderness - so don't bother.  When pork is done, I shred the pork, add the remaining BBQ sauce or how ever much you want and let it sit in the crock pot on high for another 30-1hr to heat through.  I like Stubbs Original BBQ sauce (a little spicy) or Stubbs Mesquite BBQ sauce (thick & sweet) or mix 1/2 and 1/2 of each. Eat with warm Kaiser buns and you're in heaven.  So easy to make but taste like a lot of work.  Awesome dish!  Finish off with a slice of Coconut Sour Cream Cake (from this website) and you're transported to Southern Heaven.",

                "reviewBody": "This pork turned out soo tender and moist!  I used a 9 pound bone-in pork shoulder and trimmed it down to fit into my crock pot.  I added a can of beef broth (left out the coffee b/c the roast will give off a lot of natural juices) and some salt and pepper and put the lid on it and let it do its thing in the pot for 8 hours.  The next morning my apartment smelled awesome and I shredded it and had the pulled pork all ready for Sunday dinner!  Come sunday, I put the meat back in the crock pot with a bottle of Baby's Ray's and let my guests dish out their own sandwiches.  My advice to someone who wants to do Pulled pork, use the shoulder or butt portion roast.  I wouldn't waste a cut like tenderloin on some thing like this.  The long, slow cooking toughens a cut like tenderloin, whereas a cut like the shoulder has lots of connective tissue and fat thatt softens as its cooked.  Save the tenderloin for shorter cooking times.  This is a really easy recipe to follow and turns out really well.",

He also said this was the best thing I ever cooked (and I am a fairly good cook). I agree - it is really good! We usually drive 40 minutes to a restaurant in Maine so he can get a pulled pork sandwich. We are going to save money and a lot on gas now! I made a smaller roast because my crock pot is small, so I cut the recipe in half. (Our 2.5 lb. roast made about 5 good-sized sandwiches.) I used Hunt's BBQ \"Hickory\" sauce and it was perfect (not too sweet and slightly smokey). I added a small amount to the shredded pork and then we added extra on our sandwiches as needed. I served the shredded pork on toasted kaiser rolls. Really good!",

I was leary because I've never made pulled pork before, but this was soooooo easy to complete and the flavor was just incredible with my homemade BBQ sauce.  I made a small tweak by adding 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke to the broth.  Started it at midnight in a slow cooker on Low and went to bed.\n\nI wasn't sure what to do with all that broth the next morning, but reading the various reviews I went ahead and removed the shoulder from my cooker (about 11am) then poured the broth out into a large gravy separator.  Pulled the pork apart on a tray with forks (being careful not to overdo it and make it too fine) then returned it to the cooker.  Added 1 ladle of the broth back in ... along with 3 cups of my BBQ sauce.  Cooked it one more hour then served on kaiser rolls with side dishes.  Oh Wow!!!  None of us could believe how great this turned out.  Everyone was commenting on it and nobody could stop with just one sandwich.  \n\nI can't see eating the pork without a BBQ sauce or gravy as some reviewers commented, but with the right sauce - this is a definite HOME RUN !!!   Thanks, Sarge.  I'm making this again when family comes to town in two weeks.  They'll love it.",

I added three minced cloves of garlic and some onion flakes. I sprinkled the roast with salt & pepper and then seared it before putting it in the slow cooker. It cooked all day and smelled delicious when we got home. After six hours it really did fall apart easily. I took about a third of the meat and placed it in a pot on the stove. I added the season broth and BBQ sauce. Sweet! The plain meat itself appeared dry at first but then we put the \"au ju\" as my hubby called the seasoned broth on the shredded pork and placed it back in the slow cooker. Delicious! My hubby was very impressed and had two of each sandwich...plain and BBQ. That was his birthday dinner and he loved it! Thank you! It's a sure bet I'll be making this again in the future!",
