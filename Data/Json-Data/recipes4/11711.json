I found the \"gravy\" took a little more cornstarch than mentioned to thicken to my liking the addition of the mushrroms produces extra liquid. Thank you for your submission we enjoyed trying this!",

I did edit the recipe: I ended up dicing and keeping the bacon inside the recipe. I had some chorizo (Spanish sausage) just laying around so I threw that in too. I tripled the garlic and threw in a can of garlic and basil tomatoes with the liquid. I skipped the cornstarch and the cold water and added two tablespoons of flour instead. I added a couple more orange peels and threw in a sprinkling of basil and white pepper. I put in a whole can of chopped olives and used sugar snap peas since we love the crunch. I didn't use the pickled onions and just threw them in raw. I actually cooked everything together for about 1h 45 mins and added the peas in for 10 minutes at the end to preserve the crunch. It came out UNBELIEVABLE! Hope this helps someone!",
