I ended up with 5 slices of bacon after breakfast this morning so I used them and I don't think I had as much blue cheese as called for in the recipe. I also did not return them to the oven to broil after the garlic butter was added. These are very good and will be made again. I think they would be good with chopped green onion mixed in too.",
