FASTEST, EASIEST, TASTIEST soup I've ever made from scratch!  \nNow for my additions. I added two carrot sticks, finely chopped and a bay leaf.  Also, instead of onion powder, I used two cloves of garlic, pressed in the garlic press.  \nI have an electric pressure cooker so I simply set it for high pressure for 30 minutes and let it naturally release the pressure. Consistency was perfect!  Prep time was about 10 min so whole thing was done in about an hour!  SPLIT PEA SOUP IN AN HOUR!  Gotta love the pressure cooker and this recipe!",
