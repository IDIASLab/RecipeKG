The corn flakes sometimes stuck to the pan leaving me with a couple of naked filets. I squeezed some fresh lemon juice on them at the end and everyone seemed to like the fish. For the sweet potato fries I used frozen but seasoned and baked them as the recipe directed. Everone liked those fine too. The cole slaw...it was not good. The yogurt gave it a sour taste and chalky consistency. I like the idea of a healthier slaw but next time I'll stick to a vinegar based slaw.",
