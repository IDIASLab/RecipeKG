        "description": "This is my grandma's lumpia and pancit that she has been making since before the family moved to the U.S. when my dad was a child. This is very popular with both family and friends. As soon as my friends in high school discovered my grandma was in town, my house became THE place for lunch! She serves her lumpia with a garlic and vinegar dipping sauce.  It's very pungent, but oh so tasty. You can make a large batch of the lumpia and freeze it, so you can fry up some when ever you crave it! Spring roll wrappers are the best to use, they are thinner and lighter than egg roll wrappers.",

I find this recipe intriguing and when finished with fish sauce or pancit seasoning or any myriad combination of seasonings it is quite tasty and satisfying. I think that's what they mean when they say \"season to taste.\" I also believe any decently educated cooking instructor would know that pancit is a noodle and the name refers to several noodle dishes made with those noodles or similar type noodles. Usually a stir fry with different meats veggies and noodles flavored with soy sauce and fish sauce. There are many variations. A good pancit is priceless and never a casserole. Spring roll wrappers can be found in Asian markets some very large grocery stores Wegman's grocery stores or online. Bon Appetit RT Crum",

Do you honestly think 1 pound of chicken cooked in water is going to do anything? Then it was bland. I added onion and garlic to try to save it. Then 8 ounces of canton noodles do not need 8 cups of water to cook in. The recipe made it seem as if you should use all of it. Quite frankly I only used 3 cups to get the noodles right. Pancit is a casserole not a soup. The remaining half of the mixture is supposed to go into lumpia's (made with spring roll wrappers not lumpia wrappers) and the mixture is way to coarse for that. Definitely have to chop it fine. Good luck making this. I've been a cooking school instructor for 13 years and I had to really change it to get it to work.",
