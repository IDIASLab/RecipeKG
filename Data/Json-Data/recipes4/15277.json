If you want to spiff it up a bit, you can add diced onions, and celery to the bottom of the crock, put the chicken on top of the vegetables, pour in the combined liquid over the chicken, and put the stuffing mix on top. I use Mrs. Cubbison's stuffing mix (16oz), but it still works great. After cooking the stuffing on top, you can pull out the chicken and stir the stuffing into the liquid. I work away from the home so I had to slow cook on low for the day and the chicken has great flavor, but ends up as shredded chicken after 10 hours. Luckily, my family love it. We all give it 5 stars!",

Stuffing mix (Chicken Stove Top) with the soup and water I was concerned it may be a little dry so I mixed in about half of the broth to that mix instead of in the bottom of the cooker with the chicken. It was pretty good! I'm not certain if my alteration was truly needed. I used cream of chicken mushroom soup as I didn't have plain chicken on hand. I will probably make this easy meal again. Next time I might play around and add cranberries mushrooms celery and serve the chicken with steamed broccoli and a small portion of the dressing for a healthy meal. Thanks Beth!",
