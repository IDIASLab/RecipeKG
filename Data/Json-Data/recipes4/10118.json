Use plenty of foil as damper will expand a lot as it cooks and bury in coals with a shovel. (Is best to use a fire that has died down to just hot coals.) As the submitter said damper will be cooked when it sounds hollow. If your really keen wrap a handful of dough around 5-10cm of the end of a clean stick and toast it over the campfire; once cooked pull it off the stick and fill with honey and butter!!! A bit of trial and error but good fun and delicious!!",
