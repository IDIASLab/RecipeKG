You can prepare this the day before and simply throw it in the oven when guests arrive so YOU can entertain while the oven does the work. I hope you like it as much as I do! (You might try a little less black pepper. My new black pepper was spicier than my other and 1 tsp would have been plenty.)",

When I made the mustard mixture I had to make a another with less pepper because 2 tsp. of pepper is just way too overpowering! I didn't have phillo dough so I substituted cornbread mix. It worked out really well and was a good flavor addition to the corned beef and cabbage. I also didn't have Swiss cheese at the time so I used Parmesan/Romano. That worked out alright in a pinch",
