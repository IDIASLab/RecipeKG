I coated them with olive oil rather than cooking spray and finished them with a fragrant good quality truffle oil I brought back from Italy. Truffled potato bliss.",

Truffle oil has a very distinct flavor, and personal taste preferences will kick in, but doubtful I'll use it again on french fries, but there were no leftovers either.",
