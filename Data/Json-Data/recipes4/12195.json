The nitrites and nitrates cure the ground meat; without them, you have fresh sausage which should be used within a few days.  Tender Quick is not the same as table, sea, kosher, etc.  If you used table salt in this recipe, you have a very salty fresh sausage.  One tablespoon of Morton Tender Quick is the usual amount used per pound of meat.  If you order Instacure online and use it instead of the Tender Quick, you can then adjust the amount of salt and still have a cured bologna.",

Use the correct ingredients and you get the results you're looking for.  The bologna we buy now is JUNK...real bologna back in the day was more like a sausage.  Mmmm, I can't wait to have a fried bologna sammich like my grandma use to make!  Thank you! Will post again. :)",
