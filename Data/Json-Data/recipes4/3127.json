                "reviewBody": "Yes it is a \"cakey\" cookie. However if you want a firmer denser (less-cakelike) cookie substitute a stick of softened butter for the applesauce. While I do sub applesauce often b/c it lowers the fat content...it also changes the texture of baked goods creating a spongey texture. You can also do 1/4 c. applesauce 1/4 cup butter or oil. I increased the spices and added 1/2 tsp. of ginger too. A browned butter icing is yummy drizzled over tops. Just brown a bit of butter until it's nutty brown and beat in a bit of powdered sugar until it's your desired consistancy. Next time I make these I will sandwich them with marshmallow fluff beat with cream cheese. Excellent \"fall\" whoopie pies.",

Flattening them before baking helped with the second pan but still they came out airy light and very moist... just like cake.",

To avoid greasiness I used parchment paper instead of greasing the pans.",
