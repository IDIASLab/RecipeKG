Our vermicilli fideo only comes in 5 oz packages here so I used a 26 oz box of stock and only 1 and about 2/3 the other tomato bullion cube and then simmered it until the liquid was reduced. I added a generous pinch of both ground cumin and oregano. Awesome meal! Original: Thanks Amy! I found my new favorite fideo recipe. This was great. Quick and easy to make. I used chicken boullion cubes instead of tomato and mexican tomato sauce and water for the broth. I did add some comino and topped this with sour cream and some mexican cheese blend. I snuck in a pinch of oregano too as suggested by another reviewer thanks SB for the tip! This turned out great and I will be making this one again (and again).",
