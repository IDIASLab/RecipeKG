Also no dried rosemary so I used an Italian seasoning blend that had rosemary oregano marjoram basil and thyme and that worked fine. Finally I only had cannelini beans on hand and that also worked fine - I actually think I prefer them as they are a bit creamier than navy beans. The result was one excellent dip! I do think that for us an extra head of garlic might have been too much but otherwise this is one of my favorites now. Great for veggies toasted pita wedges tortilla chips or even crackers.",

First I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and increased it to 3/4 cup. I also added two tablespoons of lemon juice for a bit of zip. Caramelized the onion for some sweetness (from the recipe I think that's a bit longer than originally stated). The main changes I made were in the spices. I used 1 tsp cumin 1/2 tsp each of ground coriander sumac Aleppo pepper and paprika and then a pinch of Cayenne. With the changes made I think this one served with pita bread will be a staple for us when we're doing a Mediterranean/North African menu.",
