I also serve the marinara sauce on the side for dipping and seed and slice the pepperoncinis before adding them. If you love cheese (and who doesn't?) you can grate some parmesan over it too once it's done baking.",

I definitely woulddn't attempt these again without making TWO very important adjustments. First I'd fry up my sausage and then add just enough pizza (or spaghetti) sauce to moisten. This time I drizzled my nachos with sauce as Christina did (over the meat layer). Had I served it on the side my nachos would have been SUPER dry (even more so than they already were). I'd also change the cooking method. Instead of broiling I think baking at 350 for 10-15 minutes would yield a better outcome. I nearly burt my nachos and I rarely ever burn anything! Other than slightly modifying how I prepared these I only made one additional change. I sprinkled my nachos with a couple of sliced green onions because they just seemed to be missing that little something... I think sliced olives would be a nice touch too but since my hubs and I don't care for them I didn't bother. All in all these were good but my allegiance still goes to Laura B. for her restaurant style chicken nachos also on this site. I'm glad to have given your recipe a try but I'm not a convert just yet. Thanks anyways reneeg!:-)",
