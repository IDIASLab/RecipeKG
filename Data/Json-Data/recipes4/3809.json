Here's my suggestions for next time:   -- substitute red potatoes if you don't have new potatoes and dice them into 1/2 inch chunks -- after cooking the bacon, remove it and cook the onions in the bacon fat.   Add another T or 2 of butter if necessary -- once the onion is cooked, add the potatoes and garlic.   Cook for a couple minutes and then add the green beans and broth -- do not add too much broth as this will make your 'sauce' too soupy. --  make sure you have a large enough pot to be able to mix the vegetables as they cook.  Otherwise the bottom cooks and the top is still raw. -- Once the dish is plated,  sprinkle the bacon on top for an attractive presentation. -- Enjoy!!",

No need to fry up bacon, you could just use bottled real bacon bits.  Also since the small new potatoes aren't used whole, they are diced, you could just use 3 or 4 regular size potatoes.  Loved the balsamic vinegar in this. Will be making this again!",

That gave the potatoes & green beans the right cooking times (both were fresh from my farm, so getting them perfect is super yummy).  It turned out amazing!!!",
