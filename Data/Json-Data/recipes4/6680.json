The quiche came out clean and neat and nothing stuck to the pan.   I strongly recommend doing that.",

First, I fried up 2 pieces of bacon, then added the butter and olive oil, as well as about a clove of minced garlic.  Then I added the onion and sauteed it as directed.  I also used cheddar cheese, rather than the mozz, and made a little extra - 4 eggs, etc.  I had great luck using a glass baking dish sprayed with Butter-flavored Pam.  No sticking at all!  This was so easy to do, that I'll be adding it to my \"things I do all the time\" file... :)",

                "reviewBody": "I read the Cook's Notes, and decided to give this a sprinkle of paprika to give the top of the quiche a little more color (that worked beautifully).  I sprayed the dish liberally with cooking spray, and had zero difficulty getting it out of the dish.  I was concerned that it might not look too appealing if it was too shallow/flat, so I did use a little smaller baking dish dish (8x6x2).  This will puff up and then deflate after it comes out of the oven, but the texture is moist, and the flavor divine.  In an effort to get the fat down, I substituted half-and-half for the whipping cream, and I don't think there was much, if any, sacrifice in flavor.  More realistically (at least in this house), I think you're looking at 6 servings.  This was lunch today with a nice green salad, and I anticipate the leftovers will be gone tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, we liked it.",
