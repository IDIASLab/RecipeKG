I wouldn't prefer it as an entree/meal, but in a smaller portion it is fantastic!  I subbed smoked ham for the sausage (and sauteed it and the onion in a bit of butter), but other than that followed the recipe, though I did reduce the thyme a touch per personal preference.  This was delicious and unlike anything I've ever eaten.  I think it would be delicious w/some leftover mashed potatoes added to the mix, too.  THANKS for the unusual recipe, KFREESE!",

I use a 14 oz. can of sauerkraut and I add a bit more thyme to mine, as well as black pepper. I also leave the sausage as a coarse chop. Please note:  You MUST add 1-2 T. of lemon juice at the very end - this adds a perfect tartness and zing, and it is a traditional part of this recipe.  My family loves this recipe and it's perfect for a winter evening.",

I had some sauerkraut that was leftover from another recipe which had apples carrots and caraway seeds in it so I used it. I did not use the thyme as I am not a fan and the sauerkraut was already seasoned. I halved the recipe but used 4 Tablespoons of flour to be sure we got a thick soup. It actually turned out too thick and I had to add some chicken broth. Thanks for educating us on a different kind of soup. We will be having this again.",
