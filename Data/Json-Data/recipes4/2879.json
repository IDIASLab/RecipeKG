BTW - I brined the chops in 1/4 cup table salt to 1 qt of water for 30 minutes.  It makes them juicy and not dried out when cooked.  Just rinse them off after 30 minutes, blot with a paper towel and proceed with the recipe.  It will NOT make them salty.  Brining works with chicken too.  I also added some heavy cream the last 5 minutes of cooking time.  Excellent recipe.",

Once we reach the double digits on ingredients, I get nervous.  When I set out to make this, I thought it would be a challenge...especially with that ever present fear of ending up with dry pork.  My fears were unwarranted.  This was insanely easy.  I used thin sliced, center cut pork loin chops so I didn't have to pound it thin.  I even mixed the flour and spices in a ziplock baggie, and threw the meat in so I didn't dirty another bowl.  Threw in a pre-sliced package of baby bella mushrooms so I had almost no work at all.  For those contemplating taking the meat out while the sauce thickens out of fear of overcooking, fear not.  The wine in a covered pot apparently takes care of that.  Last fear was that the marsala would be a strong flavor.  Nope.  It blended beautifully.  Easy?  Absurdly so.  Taste?  Delicious.  That earns it a solid home on the regular rotation at our house.",
