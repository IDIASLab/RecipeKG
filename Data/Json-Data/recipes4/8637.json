I also added some fresh ripped basil in right near the end to brighten up the peas a bit. Try it out! Hey I see njmom thinks like I do! Amen on that basil at the end.",

Also, the peas needn\u2019t be cooked for five minutes \u2013 tossing them in just before serving is all they need.  The pasta does absorb a lot of the sauce, but rather than adding more cream I simply added some reserved pasta cooking water.  \u201cSuper Easy Spinach and Red Pepper Salad\u201d completed the meal.
