From a presentation point of view I didn t like the way the top of the muffin collapsed. I also wasn t crazy about the dense texture since I m used to a lighter cornbread. It s OK. Shantelle thanks for sharing your recipe.",

I also wanted to reserve some of my sour cream for another recipe, so I reduced that to only one heaping tablespoon of the cream plus a tablespoon of margarine to balance it all out. Turned out fabulous!",
