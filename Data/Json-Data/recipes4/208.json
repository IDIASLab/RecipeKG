Some advice: oftentimes swiss cheese can be used in place of gruyere and since the gruyere was expensive I decided to go this route. I used an inexpensive swiss and the flavor was too stong for this dish. Next time I will try either Cracker Barrel's Baby Swiss (which is hard to find and why I had to use a store-brand of block swiss) or spring for the Gruyere. I also used only button mushrooms since I prefer those to shiitake. Finally next time I make this I'm going to cover the dish with foil after pouring the sauce over and baking since the sauce basically bakes away and/or \"hardens\" onto the pasta in it's half hour in the oven.",

I added some red pepper flakes in with the garlic & since I omitted the chicken the ricotta mixture seemed boring.. so I spiced it up a bit with some coriander parsley S&P and a pinch of allspice. It gave the shells plenty of taste. I wouldn't change the sauce. It was very tasty!",

Once it cooled completly I cut up the chicken in a fine dice. I also chopped up the mushrooms into smaller pieces. I added 2 cups of ricotta cheese and 1 tsp. of italian seasonings to the chicken/cheese mixture. Once it was combined well I put it in a pastry bag and used it to fill up the shells much easier this way. It filled up 20 jumbo shells. I noticed that a lot of the shells broke so I am glad that I cooked more than 8 oz. I would have like more sauce so maybe the addition of a cup of chicken broth would do the trick. Also for the blandness these stuffed shells taste great with a little spaghetti sauce drizzled on top.",

I bought the Gruyere it was expensive but worth it sharp and delicious - it does not taste like swiss cheese to me more a cross between swiss and sharp provolone. I too chose to use marsala wine instead of sherry I think marsala is not as strong and the substitution was delicious. My sauce needed a lot of thinning from chicken stock the roux stayed in roux form once i added the liquids slowly... it seized right back up. Delicious even if it took a while and dirtied a lot of dishes.",
