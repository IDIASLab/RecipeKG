It was messy, time consuming (getting the chicken wrapped securely around those pats of butter is HARD....rolling the chicken breasts pierced with skewers/toothpicks in the coatings and getting them well-covered is even harder!!) and the end result was very bland.  Maybe I should have used some salt (which is not listed anywhere in the recipe)??",

I did not have fresh herbs so I used dried ones and added one more tsp of lemon juice. I also prefer my chicken kiev baked so I added some extra virgin olive oil to the bread crumbs prior to the coating step. I then baked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. They were so good my 5 and 3 year olds made up a new word to describe how good this was. My husband thought they were better than the store bought brands...definitely will make these again....They were a big Valentine's Day HIT!!",
