This is one that works well and can be easily changed with the herbs you have on hand or in your garden. We are starting clean-eating this week and tweaked some recipes. This can also be used as a pizza crust, topped with hummus, bruschetta, pesto, or even egg/tofu salad. It's great for any gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, or vegetarian diet.",

However the water ratio was too much I added about 3 TBLS of gluten free flour to it as it was too liquidity. I used 2 Corning Ware pie plates when I baked them this worked well. Topped the bread with hummus spinach tomatoes crumbled bacon and sprinkled Cilantro as the final step. YUMMY!",
