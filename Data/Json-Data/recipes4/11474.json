Couple squeezes of brown mustard,  worshy sauce, soy sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, and sriracha hot sauce. i marinaded it for about 1 hr 15 minutes. i cooked it with olive oil and in the liquid for about 1 1/2 minutes to a simmer and then drained it. i cut long green onions and slightly saut\u00e9ed those with the beef. AWESOME. I love spicy and added extra sriracha hot sauce. my boyfriend did too and he loved it.\nsince i drained the marinade the rice was slightly dry so we added a touch of soy sauce. the beef was salty enough so i wouldnt recommend putting it on the beef, only the rice.\n\nI suspect bok choy would be amazing in this. next time!\n\na nice version of beef and onion on rice. \nyum! im stuffed.",

I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the marinade and it was perfect.  \r\n\r\nI heated the oil in a large non-stick pan so the meat could be in a single layer.  I cooked on medium for about 3-4 minutes per side.  I guess it depends how thickly you slice the steak.  I sliced mine between 1/4 and 1/2\".  \r\n\r\nIt was snowing here and it was so nice to make such a tasty recipe where I happened to have all the ingredients on-hand.  \r\n\r\nWe are going to make this again - soon!",

I used only 1/4 cup of Worc. 2 Tbsp Honey Mustard and mixed in 1/4 c Brown Sugar so that the flavor would be in the marinade. If the marinade is too thick you can thin it a little with water or apple or citrus juice but avoid adding additional Worc. Sauce or you are back to having too much \"kick\" for some folks. I sauteed onions garlic mushrooms and red pepper strips then added the steak strips to cook. It was fabulous over brown rice.",

Sauce, 1/4 cup tamari soy, 2 tablespoons minced garlic, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper, 2 tablespoons Boetje's stone ground mustard, 1/2 cup olive oil. Blend all ingredients in blender till smooth.  Put steak, or chicken, strips in ziploc with marinade and pop in the fridge for as long as you like; i did mine for 3 hours and it was wonderful!!!!  Saute some yellow and red peppers along with 2 yellow or white onions and 1 tablespoon of minced garlic in a little olive oil until tender crisp.  remove veggies and saute strips for about 6 min. total. remove meat and add leftover marinade, boil for at least 5 min.  Serve everything over long grain white or brown rice.  Delicious!!!!",
