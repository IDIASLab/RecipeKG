We had to modify slightly due to dietary restrictions so we make a replacement for tomatoes sauce intended to taste very close to puree tomatoes and no chili powder.

Note you need minute ride and it didn't specify so rice was crunchy. We didn't notice to bad as we ate with chips as this was our variation on our taco Tuesday night.",
