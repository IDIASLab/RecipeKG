I did add some minced garlic - the equivalent of about one clove just for good measure. I pounded the chicken down thin as instructed and poked it with a fork. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it go for 8 hours. It smelled great and tasted even better. It's sweet yet has just a mild kick with nice citrus flavor. Plus the chicken has a beautiful color to it. And as the submitter suggested I served it with warm tortillas homemade salsa guacamole and warm black beans topped with a dollup of sour cream for a Southwestern flair. What's great about this recipe is you could easily take this and add some cumin and curry (1/4 tsp. each) to the marinade then serve with couscous to give a Middle Eastern flair. This is a definite keeper!",

However this isn't too great to eat on its own (according to me) and would do justice if added to salads or served on tortillas with salsa. Whilst I'll keep that in mind next time I think I will also add some chopped cilantro to the marinade....and perhaps allow the chicken to sit in the marinade overnight. Nevertheless good recipe.:) Thanks Osider760!",

Served with grilled sweet potatoes and a tossed salad w/Balsamic vinaigrette. The dinner was just perfect for Florida summers and it WAS better than El Pollo Loco as another reviewer mentioned. I'll definitely use it for a taco filling with just some cilantro jalape\u00f1o onion and queso fresco. Yum! Hubby suggested the marinade would make a great reduction and I agree. And such a versatile jumping-off recipe - it could work well with a little pineapple juice or extra honey to give it an island flair. I halved the recipe for 3 people omitted the coriander (didn't have any) and used full amount of red pepper for kick. Biggest surprise - we could taste each citrus component. LOVE THIS RECIPE! Call me goofy but I think it would make superb fish tacos too.",

This was marinated for about 10 hours. Not sure what coriander is - but could only find whole coriander. I just broke/smashed it up with the back of a spoon.
