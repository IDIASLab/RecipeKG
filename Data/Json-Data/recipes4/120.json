But a few additions:  add 1/2 box of 10oz. frozen, chopped spinach to meat mixture while cooking for more nutrition & color.  Moms, this is a good way to sneak in something green.  Also, as previous reviews states, the cottage cheese needs one egg to bind together or else it's too runny. And add a few dashes of grated nutmeg to cottage mixture- (an old italian secret!).  And one more trick for lasagna makers: no need to wash an extra pot to boil lasagna noodles.  Put very hot tap water into a large bowl and soak the raw, hard noodles for 20-30 min.  Noodles won't be cooked, but soft and can complete it's cooking in the oven.  I learned this trick from a caterer, try it!",

I did use Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese (wanted a classic feel), however, I don't think it had any impact on the taste.  I read all of the reviews and based on all suggestions made the following alterations:\r\n1.  Doubled the meat amount.\r\n2.  Added 1 teaspoon dried oregano to meat/spaghetti sause mixture.\r\n3.  Added 1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasonig to meat/spaghetti sause mixture.  \r\n4.  Used Presco Spaghetti sause with mushrooms\r\n5.  Added 1 teaspoon dried oregano to cheese mixture.\r\n6.  Added 2 eggs to cheese mixture\r\n7.  Added 2 teaspoons of fresh minsed parsley to cheese mix\r\n8.  Added a layer of sauteed mushrooms after the meat layer.\r\n9.  Added a few slices (5 per layer) of Provologne cheese after the mozarella, except for the top (no Provologne cheese there).\r\n10.  Did not grease the pan, but put a layer of meat instead.\r\n11.  Did not cook the lasagna noodles beforehand.  They cooked very well in the oven.\r\n12.  Kept in the oven heated to 350F for about 50 minutes.\r\n\r\nNext time I'll try Italian sausage and some garlic in the cheese.",

When I get to the top layer I top the last layer of cheese mixture with a light layer of only mozzeralla chesse.  Make it the night before and bake it the next day---really lets the flavor set in!!

                "reviewBody": "This recipe turned out very good....but of course I tweaked it a little bit. I used a pound and a half of ground beef due to other's suggestions to add more beef. I used one whole medium onion chopped and 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic and sauteed them before adding them to the browned meat. I spiced that up with a little salt and pepper garlic powder and italian seasoning. I then added just enough gravy (spaghetti sauce) to the meat mixture so it was absorbed but not runny then I let that simmer. (Hint - use at least 52 oz. of sauce total in the recipe or else your lasagna will be dry.) Meanwhile I mixed up the cheeses (I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese and locatelli for the parmesan - more authentic) and used Barilla lasagna noodles and did not boil them first - followed the no boil suggestion. I layered with my ingredients according to the Barilla box - but sprinkled a little Italian seasoning on the final layer of mozzarella cheese. Covered with foil and baked at 360 for 55 minutes then removed the foil and baked for another 5 minutes. My husband could not wait to eat it and he has been raving about it for 3 days now. Thanks to Bob and Barilla!",

Also, don't grease the pan, just add a thin layer of the meat sauce and it won't stick.  I substituted 1.5 bls of ground turkey for the beef and fresh garlic for the garlic salt.  This was my first time making lasagna, so I was a little lost as to what to do for the top layer since the directions were vague.  For the last layer, it's noodle, sauce, then mozzarella cheese.  And at the last 10 mins, I sprinkled on parmasan and it was good.  Thanks for sharing.",

I also found that using the exact quantities outlined in this recipe that the meat sauce was half what I needed to complete the layers. No way does this recipe serve 12 people. I think this lasagne would be OK for those used to \"American Italian\" cooking but I'll be sticking with the traditional recipe given to me by my Italian neighbour.",
