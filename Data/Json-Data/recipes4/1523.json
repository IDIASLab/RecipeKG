The pineapple is a fantastic embellishment and meshes perfectly with the ham and cheese. I used rye bread for another interesting touch.

I don't have swiss cheese so I used American slices (not my favorite but at least it melts well!). I didn't find this to be soggy at all. I put the pineapple slices in between the ham and the cheese to protect the bread. I also used homemade bread--the Cottage Cheese Bread I on this site. Worked well. I think I would like it a bit better with dijon mustard on the bread but I'm of the opinion that any grilled cheese can be made better with dijon mustard or ketchup. Thanks for the recipe!",
