It's hearty and spicy award winning chili that is sure to hit the spot on a cold winter's night. The key is in using name brand tomato soup, I have tried it with others but haven't gotten the same results. Your friends will never guess the secret ingredient. Enjoy!",

I did not use any chicken stock and I'm glad I didn't. I like my chili thick and I believe the stock would have made it more like chili soup. For a little more liquid I put about a half bottle of beer which was the perfect consistency for me. The only other change I made was I added 4 cloves of garlic with the onion and I cut back on the chili powder to 4 tablespoons - which was plenty. I used 3/4 teaspoon of red pepper - which was plenty of spice. I also used Bush's Chili Beans. Topped with cheddar cheese and slatines - YUM! Perfect for a cold night. I can't wait to eat leftovers tonight.",

Taste isn't bad but it strikes me as more of a pasta sauce that someone added a lot of beans and chile powder and left out the Italian spices. In Chile the meat should take center stage and have a good balance of vegetables and spices regardless of the heat level. In this tomatoes clearly dominate with the beans a close second. Meat flavor is seriously lacking and it is very thin and soupy even tho I followed other reviewers suggestions and cut the chicken broth amount in half and increase meat 50%-which are the only changes I made. Sorry Justin.",

We mixed in some sour cream and cheese and it was excellent. This is really good with the amusement park cornbread recipe from this site.",

Let me tell you, it makes all the difference in the world. Before you make this chili, make sure you have a good chili powder in the cubbard. The taste of this chili is truly one of a kind.
