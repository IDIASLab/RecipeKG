A win-win for a pre-diabetic fitness freak like me. However as written it's a bit of a snooze flavor-wise. Luckily you can jazz it up easily with stuff you probably have lying around. First thing it's screaming for acid. I used fresh squeezed lemon. Next it needs some seasoning. Salt of course onion powder and garlic powder as well for me. I ended up tossing in yellow red & orange bell peppers because I had some I needed to use. You easily could leave them out & have it be just as good though. I also added a little extra oil since I used a full cup of quinoa which I prepared with vegetable stock rather than water.",

I increased the quinoa to 1/3 cup (2/3 cup water) and instead of the tomatoes I used Ro-Tel (diced tomatoes with peppers) and put in 3 tablespoons of red wine vinegar and mixed in 1/4 cup of finely shredded cheddar jack. This made a great salad meal on a hot day when you don't want heavy. Wonderful when served with warm wheat tortillas.",
