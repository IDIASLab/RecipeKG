In my head, I thought these beans went into the oven. When I realized my mistake, the recipe no longer appealed to me. I could see why the one reviewer said it tasted \"sandy green beans\". Maybe if the bread crumbs were sauteed in butter first and them sprinkled over the beans it would be better. I didn't use canned dry crumbs, but threw a couple of pieces of white bread into the food processor, along with fresh garlic and the cheese. I sprinkled the crumbs over the beans and poured melted butter over the dish. I put them in the oven for about twenty minutes and they came out very good. Kids and hubby loved them.",

I blanched the beans and mixed everything together several hrs before I was to serve dinner. Kept in the fridge then popped in the oven @ 350 for about 10-15 minutes. I think since everything had time to set and mix together I didn t get that crunchy effect other people were experiencing. Will definitely be making again!",

Ten minutes is way too long for green beans they'd turn to mush and there is too much olive oil and that wouldn't help with the mush factor either so it's no wonder that people are complaining about the bread crumbs being soggy. However I found this recipe to be easy to adjust & it turned out to be the best dish on our holiday table! I steamed the green beans with some sliced garlic until they were just slightly under cooked. Then in a saute pan I cooked 4 strips of diced bacon and when they were almost brown I added some quartered mushroom and the herbs (I used fresh but dry would still work great). Instead of adding the olive oil I sauted the steamed beans and garlic in the bacon mixture (which I hadn't drained) and then added the bread crumbs & parmesan. Next I put the whole thing in a baking dish sprinkled it with more breadcrumbs & parmesan and put it in the oven for 15-20 minutes (just long enough to finish cooking the beans & mushrooms). The parmesan didn't really melt but it browned up with the bread crumbs and made a nice crunchy layer on the top. It was incredible! It's the only thing that I made that had no leftovers! I have never served green beans at the holidays before but I will from now on! 5 Stars for the finished product!...But I never would have gotten there without this recipe!",
