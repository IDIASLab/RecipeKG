I made a few minor tweaks: 3 cloves garlic jasmine rice cabernet sauvignon wine and instead of hot pepper sauce (I didn't know what kind to use) added a bit of hungarian paprika and cayenne pepper. With chicken this was excellent. I can imagine this working well for rabbit pork squab squirrel or other medium bodied meats. Two notes: 1. I have noticed from cooking this and blood sausages that blood responds poorly to being cooked in cast iron. I would recommend any chefs trying this recipe use stainless steel or another inert cooking surface. 2.) My fresh blood had separated overnight but I was able to homogenize it by slowly pouring boiling water over the mass and pushing it through a strainer. I will make this with fresh blood next time to obviate this step.",
