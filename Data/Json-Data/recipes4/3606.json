But I've never used the two together and I was a little uncertain about trying it - it turns out I needn't have been.  I used a rump roast - I made slits and inserted slivers of fresh garlic.   I used just the 8 ounce package of mushrooms I had on hand and that was plenty, tho' I did add several cippollini onions (a nice touch, by the way).  The beer taste disappears entirely and gives way to a rich, deep beefy broth. The roast itself is robustly flavored and fork tender.  Normally I'll dredge the roast in flour and then brown it in butter but, the truth be told, I was too lazy this time - but it didn't matter as the roast sure didn't seem to suffer for it! Awesome good - glad I tried it in spite of my skepticism.",

Strain the liquid from the vegis to a sauce pan, add some beef stock and thicken with a roux to make a nice gravy to accompany the dish. However; DO NOT use a standing rib roast for this recipe unless you are rich and WANT to waste your money and ruin a beautiful piece of meat! This recipe (or any recipe using a low and slow, moist heat cooking method) should always and ONLY use a cheaper cut like a chuck roast or similar tough cut of beef. A rib roast is already a tender cut and does not need or respond well to the long cooking times used in slow cooker recipes needed to break down connective tissue and render out fat. If you want to cook a rib roast use a DRY heat method. Otherwise enjoy!",
