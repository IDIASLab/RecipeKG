The only thing I would change would be the amount of enchilada sauce... of course this all depends upon your personal taste and how strong your sauce is  . My bottle  was actually even a few ounces short o what recipe called for and it was stil a bit much. I would use the sauce.. that was good, but maybe swap some out for chicken stock to make it more soupy ans less saucy",
