The only changes I made were to add some salt and pepper to the pork while it was browning and I substituted cheddar for the Colby. We ate this \"nachos\" style topped with more cheese (we're from Wisconsin and there is no such thing as too much cheese!) and sour cream and scooped up with tortilla chips. You just HAVE to try this recipe - it's so much better than you think it's going to be! To cut down on the dishes I did everything in one large oven-proof skillet and then just popped that into the oven instead of dirtying a 13 x 9. I can't wait to make this again! Thank you for a killer dinner!",

I used 1 can of tomatoes and green chiles and a 4 oz can of tomato sauce in place of the can of tomatoes and can of chiles. I didn't add the water because of how I made the rice. I added 1 Tbsp of green chile powder. I added a can of drained sweet corn. I used Campbells Healthy Request soup (can't have regular due to MSG). I added 2 minced cloves of roasted garlic to the meat as it cooked - and used peppercorn pork tenderloin. I used Southwestern Salsa. I also used shredded sharp cheddar. I didn't cook the mixture in the oven - just let it simmer on the stove top and added the cheese at the table (didn't want to wash another pan). I served it with tortilla chips and fresh avocado on top. I'm going to use all the ingredients but the rice and make a dip substituting ground beef for the pork. I'm also going to try the entire recipe with chicken. Very yummy and \"stick to your ribs\" and great on a cold evening - lots of leftovers too!",
