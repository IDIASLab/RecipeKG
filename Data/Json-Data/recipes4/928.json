I used 2 1/2 pounds of lean ground beef (I had about 10 people to feed and I like it meaty and thick), so I doubled the chili mix, the kidney beans, steak sauce, green and red pepper, as well as red pepper flakes and cumin. Instead of stewed tomatoes, I used one big (32 oz?) can of organic fire roasted chopped tomatoes with the juice.  I did NOT add carrots or celery.  I added about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper, and about 5 tablespoons of fresh cilantro.  Finally, I shook in some chili powder to taste.  Of course I sprinkle this with freshly grated cheddar before serving and serve corn bread or muffins on the side.",

It does taste great re-heated. To make things quicker we use the Oscar Meyer real bacon bits found in the salad dressing aisle. It is peices of real chopped bacon in a vacuum sealed bag already cooked. I thought it may make a negative impact on the taste but it really didn't. It cut down our cooking time and also the fat content. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!!!!!",

                "reviewBody": "Awesome!  My husband and I tried this last night, and we are hooked!  I made the following adjustments to fit our tastes/nutritional menu:  we substituted 99% fat free ground turkey for the ground beef; we made our own chili seasoning with cumin, chili powder, cayenne pepper and garlic powder;  we omitted the bacon and tomato paste;  we added half a can of tomato juice (some reviewers suggested water or beef broth, but we like a more tomatoey chili) and a second can of sliced stewed tomatoes;  we added more carrot (we diced 1/3 of a bag of carrot chips), more green and red bell pepper and minced garlic to the mix as well as 2 cans of drained/rinsed organic black beans (in place of the 1 can of kidney beans) and a can of drained white corn.  I also cut down on the parsley to 1/2 tsp and dried cilantro to 1/4 tsp.  Wow!  As the chili cooked, the liquid dissipated a bit, so we added more tomato juice as needed and upped the amount of steak sauce (we used A1) and added more white wine (marsala) to taste.  The result was a very hearty and delicious chili with the most superb taste!  I served it with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and chopped white onion for a kick with a side of organic blue tortilla chips.  We can't wait for leftovers tonight, and we will definitely be making this recipe again and again.  There is so much you can do with this recipe to adjust it to your personal taste preferences, yet the end result will always be great.  Thanks so much!",

Obviously that required more liquid be added to this already somewhat \"dry\" chili so I added two small cans of tomato sauce--just enough to keep all the ingredients from sticking together like paste. Every few bites one catches a whiff of bacon which is quite pleasant indeed. I used real bacon which I think is clearly the way to go. The 57 Sauce cilantro and parsley all contribute their own subtle additions. This recipe is well planned and I highly recommend it. It takes a little time but is quite worth it. Just excellent!",

I didn't add celery or carrots. At the advice of other reviewers I added a 14.5 ounce can tomato sauce and a 14.5 ounce can beef broth to thin it out. I also added one whole red pepper and one whole green pepper. Even my complete \"country boy\" brother in law raved over this one (and he was skeptical about the wine in the chili!!) It's not very spicey so if you like it hot add a few more pinches of red pepper flakes. VERY GOOD!!",
