Instead it tasted like broccoli, rotisserie chicken and quinoa individually...nothing really blended to form complex flavors. It was fairly easy to make and was ok, but probably won't make it again. I even added a few extra sprinkles of both cheeses because you just can't skimp on cheese if you want real comfort food. All to no avail. I think it probably would have helped to use raw chicken instead of rotisserie so the chicken could have absorbed some of the flavors and the chicken juices would have added more flavor to the quinoa and broccoli. Wish it would have been better.",
