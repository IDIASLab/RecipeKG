What's great about it too is it's very inexpensive and makes a lot. I used minced garlic from the jar and added about 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar to cut heat a bit and cover more of the roast. I also added two vidalia onions that I quarted and added half way through cooking. I cooked this on low for 8 hours and the smell was heavenly. We served this on toasted hoagie rolls with provolone cheese. Everyone loved it! Thanks Joyce for a great recipe!",

Since only my husband and I eat this (it's too spicy for my 4 year old) I only buy a 1 pound roast (and it's usually an arm roast because we are picky about fat). I do not use the garlic but I do add a package of McCormick AuJus and 1 cup of water one hour before serving. Also before adding the mixture remove roast from crockpot shred and then put it back in. I cook it on high for 3 hours and low for about 6 hours. I love it and I'm not a big roast eater. It is always so tender no knife needed!",
