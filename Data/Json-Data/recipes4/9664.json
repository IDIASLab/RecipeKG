                "reviewBody": "I'm quite surprised this recipe is called \"Moroccan\" as the significant ingredients aren't used in Moroccan cooking (my hubster is Moroccan so I know Moroccan cooking).  With that said - I altered the recipe as follows:  I used brown (aka green) lentils as these are more traditional (and added a handful of red lentils for texture), 1 heaping tablespoon of ginger paste, 1 can of red kidney beans, 1 can northern white beans, 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can stewed tomatoes.  Do NOT use cardamom or garam masala (these are INDIAN spices not Moroccan).  I strongly recommend salt/pepper to taste, cumin, and RAS EL HANOUT.  Ras el hanout is a classic blend of Moroccan spices - similar to garam masala but different.  Ras el hanout varies from one Moroccan to another but generally it's the following spices (usually whole spices all ground together but you can use the ground versions as well):  \n<  \n1 t cumin, 1 t ginger, 1 t salt, 1 t pepper, 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/2 t coriander, 1/2 t allspice, 1/4 t cloves and a pinch of saffron  >>>\nI pressure cooked everything together for about 10 minutes and voila - delicious!  Here's a helpful cooking tip:  If cooking on the stove (or even the crockpot)- the lentils will cook faster if you do NOT add the salt or tomatoes until the end... salt and the acidity of the tomatoes prevents beans/lentils from softening which will prolong the cooking time.  ***UPDATE*** Recipe with Indian spices is good too - make sure to double the spice though.",

Some friends walked into the house just after I started to boil the soup and they commented on the wonderful aroma that filled the house! I used brown lentils instead of red, I used red kidney beans instead of cannellini (which is white kidney beans), and I diced my own carrots, tomatoes, and celery. Fresh is always better than canned! I also used bagged beans instead of canned because of the higher nutritional value bagged beans have, so I had to let the soup cook longer (I made it around 8 AM and it was ready by 9 PM. I didn't have any cardamom so I used 3/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 3/4 teaspoon of ground cloves. Garam masala is a spice combo of cinnamon, cloves, and black pepper, so you don't really need more garam masala... A great taste!",

I used 4 cups (a carton) of veggie broth and 2 cups water.  Cooked in my crockpot for about 12 hours on low, and it was perfect.  Thick and yummy.  I added an extra 1/2 tsp. of garam masala because I love it.  I only used a sprinkle of cayenne.  Served with warm mini wheat pitas from Trader Joe's.",
