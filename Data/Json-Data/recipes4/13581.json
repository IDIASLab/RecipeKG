Either way I was recommended it to get the wax off of some apples for a recipe. It didn't quite get the waxy shine off of the apples but I guess it cleaned them better. I ended up rewashing them in super hot water to remove that. Plus I was afraid of a vinegar after taste on the apples. If it kills something possibly deadly and that is the intent than great stuff.",
