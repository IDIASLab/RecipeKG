I dropped one egg into my measuring cup and added enough warm milk to make 1 1/2 cups of liquid. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It's not exactly a complaint but this made one HUGE loaf of bread. My kids loved this bread and I will make it again. I will probably make smaller loaves in 8X4 bread pans the next time.

It makes a nice loaf with a lot of interesting textures and it makes awesome toast for peanut butter. It is honestly one of the more forgiving recipes for bread so you can happily add or change things. I ve also tossed in sunflower seeds slivered almonds ground walnuts pumpkin seeds sesame seeds and flax seeds for that added crunchiness. It is a great recipe written as is but you honestly can add a ton of different things and make it unique to your own taste. I always try the original recipe with no changes and it was a very good bread. I took it to heart when they said substitutions and have went nuts with variations! Thank you so much for this tasty healthy delicious versatile recipe!",
