The chuck roast marinated all day.  When it was time to grill we put the meat in a pan and added the marinade to the pan.  It grilled slowly for about an hour.  The results were a delicious roast with fantastic flavor.  I then boiled the marinade to make sure it was completely cooked.  Once cooled, I added the leftover roast slices for another meal.  We used part of it another night served over a baked potato.  Still having meat and broth left, into the freezer it went to use in a pot of beef and noodles or a stockpot full of beef vegetable soup.  Loved the taste of this and so glad I didn't discard the marinade.  (5-stars)",
