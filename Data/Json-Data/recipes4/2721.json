I doubled the curry powder, and added 2 cloves of garlic, mushrooms, carrots, cranberries, salt, pepper, and the spices recommended by others, apart from the extra chilli. I added a splash of soy sauce at the end, too. It turned out beautifully.   I think it would probably go better again (although would require a little more work) by frying up the spices, onions, garlic and chicken before popping them in the slow cooker.   I noted someone was concerned about too much liquid in the final result. The apples do release a lot as they cook, so I decided to eliminate the milk, which can separate in slow cooking, by adding a 50g sachet of powdered coconut milk to the stock, which I made up with a full teaspoon of powder in a cup of boiling water.  This was great. :-)",

I enjoyed this meal with the additions of carrots instead of celery cranraisins for color and tartness (put in just a few minutes before serving) and the additional spices of cumin cinnamon and chili powder that another reviewer recommended. Also for some texture I didn't add the apples at the beginning but rather about half way through. I also used yogurt instead of milk. I served it with baked potatoes. The one thing that I don't like is that there seems to be more liquid left over than one may expect - but it still tastes really good and has some really unique and different flavor combos.",

I will agree that the apples seemed out of place and would use potatoes instead if I fixed this again and would also add raisins for extra flavor. I also added well over the amounts of carrots and celery and was glad for the color. Since the other reviews said that it was watery I used double the amount of grain which worked out well.",
