I followed the recipe and found that even though I had a huge roast, my crockpot slow cooker set on high for 4 hours was way too long. At about the 3 hour mark I checked up on it and it was already way overcooked. I would recommend perhaps cooking it on LOW for 3-4 hours. Other than people being disappointed with the rarity of the meat (It was all well done), the flavor was fantastic and the recipe was fun and easy to follow. I would definitely try this again, but I would adjust the cooking temp and times.",

After I saute'd the onions I de-glazed the pan with 1 cup of water. I made sure to pour the liquid into the bottom of the slow-cooker but still pile the onions on top of the roast.\n\nThe resulting gravy/broth from the roast was like Au Jus!  It would make an amazing onion cream gravy if you want to take to the next level.  The broth is pretty salty so be careful.  The roast was seasoned perfectly.",
