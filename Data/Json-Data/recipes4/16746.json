I didn't cool it down overnight like the recipe instructs, I just stuck it the freezer for 15 minutes and then I proceeded with the recipe. My only changes were to add more veggies like some sliced zuchinni, mushrooms, celery. I stir fried the veggies for a few min. as we like them a little crunchy. We paired this with Asian Lettuce Wraps recipe found on this site also, super good and healthy dinner :)",

I goofed up here and there. Too much onion. The pan got too hot when I added the egg but this allows lots of flexibility and room for error. My husband said it tasted like it has meat which is a good thing for him. I'm afraid I found something that he wants me to make again. Also we served it with some bok coy and cabbage. That's it! I would be eating more now but I promised I'd let him take some to work tomorrow.:)",
