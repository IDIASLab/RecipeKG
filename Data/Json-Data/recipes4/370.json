I added 2 tablespoons of the zesty dry italian seasoning to the meat, as well as fresh sliced mushrooms, while it browned.... and then fresh sliced zucchini. I mixed some of the pasta sauce with the noodles (3/4 lb) of penne, laid it at bottom of baking pan.  I then spread the ricotta mixture on top of that, put remaining meat sauce as next layer, and lastly the mozzarella with a few shakes of parmesean .",
