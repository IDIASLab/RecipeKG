I needed some Mexican appetizers for a party but didn't have a ton of time, so I just bought a bag of frozen meatballs and put this sauce together the night before. Then the day of party I just threw the meatballs in the crock pot with the sauce and a few hours later, they were done! Everyone loved them. I think I could have threw in about twice the chipotles though. Maybe the brand I got was a mild one. But I do like it spicy!!\n\nThanks for a great recipe. I'll definitely be making these again!",

The meatballs are excellent and the sauce is fantastic! I had to add some sugar to the sauce as often is the case with tomatoes as they always vary in their sweetness. I halved the recipe and got about 90 one inch-ish meatballs. I think I'll make them 1.5 inches next time as they shrink when browning. Thanks for an easy yet wonderful recipe!",
