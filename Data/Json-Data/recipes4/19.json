I, like many other reviewers, was a bit skeptical of combining the chicken w/nothing more than 1/8 c margerine and the dry salad dressing mix, but figured there must be a reason or Judi would not have submitted it this way, so I resisted the urge to add the canned soup in the beginning. I did add a splash of red wine that I had on hand, but other than that, there was very little liquid. Also used Good Seasons Mild Italian dressing mix, since my kids don't like highly spiced food. I turned the crockpot on low and cooked for about 7+ hours, and of course the house smelled incredible. The chicken chunks were golden brown and had a roasted taste and appearance, something that wouldn't have occurred had I added the soup at the beginning. I then added a can of reduced fat cream of chick soup and a brick of red. fat cream cheese. Plopped the brick in whole, covered, then stirred after it had softened. Turned out so delicious, and in no way reduced fat tasting! My 6-year old daughter ate so many \"appetizer bites\" out of the pot, she was full by dinner time! Very creamy and rich tasting, and the dressing mix provides just the right amount of seasoning. We served over noodles -- delicious! Very easy, tasty recipe -- and seems \"fancy\" enough for company. Putting this in my Favorites folder.",

I cut down the chicken to 2 very large chicken breasts because my crock pot is only 1 1/2 quarts and it's just me eating (I don't like tons of leftovers), but I left all the other amounts for the sauce the same.  I cooked the soup (Campbell's 98% Fat Free), margarine and dressing mix plus 1/4 cup of white wine with the chicken from the beginning, then added 4 tablespoons of 1/3 less fat cream cheese (Neufchatel cheese) and about half a cup of fat free cream cheese.  It was fabulous- EXACTLY like Angel Chicken Pasta on this web site, which I love and is my favorite recipe in the world, only less fat, much, much less preparation, and fewer dishes that don't have anything burned or stuck on!  I think I'll be making this often now, thank you so much, Judi!  Update a while later: this is also awesome with pork chops instead of chicken and I use no butter and half the cream cheese.",

I threw in the frozen chicken breasts and cooked on low for 5 hours.  I then shredded the chicken in the crock pot, added softened 4 oz. Neufchatel cheese, and about 1/3 cup of fat free sour cream.  It cooked for half an hour on high.  When I tasted it, I thought it tasted almost exactly like a pasta dish I always get at the local Italian Restaurant, minus the spiciness.  To add a little kick, I threw in some chilipiquin peppers that are growing in my back yard.  Served it over wheat egg noodles.  EVERYONE in the family loved it!!!!!!  THANK YOU!",
