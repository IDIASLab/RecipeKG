After fixing it several times, my husband 'discovered' that you were supposed to spread the garlic on the chicken. It's one of his favorites now. This recipe is very easy to adjust up or down.  Just make sure your pan is big enough if adjusting up.  I usually add more potatoes, since we like them.  Serve with a mixed greens salad.",

I had a 4 pack of chicken thighs I wanted to use, so that's what I used instead what it called for. I only had a small square brownie type pan, so I used that instead of a roasting pan. I used one whole garlic cluster, separated and peeled, about 14 cloves or so. I had to bake it 20 extra minutes to get the thermometer to 165. I don't think it needed all that garlic, not that it hurt it at all, but you really only got the garlic taste by smooshing the cloves onto the chicken at the end, and each piece used about 2 cloves. It turned out great and the potatoes were to die for! I didn't have to add any salt once to them on my plate (which is unusual for me) and they were so buttery! I will be adding this dish to my regular rotation.",

Tenders also cook faster than bone in meat. If we make this again, I will try some sweet potatoes, a side of butternut squash and more spice for the meat. As an aside, this is naturally gluten free if you use GF spices, and so forth. I love recipes with simple, natural ingredients. This was quick to assemble, and I was able to make a batch of No Bake Cookies V while it baked. =)",
