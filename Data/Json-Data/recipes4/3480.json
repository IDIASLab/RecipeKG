Frying/ browning food in oil creates carcinogens, so I always cook in a small amount of water or broth and add organic EEVO at the end of cooking for the health benefits. I stirred in the chopped spinach at the last minute and used organic since spinach is high in pesticides and loses nutrients when cooked. Fresh chopped tomatoes added near the end so not mushy (and some dried basil and oregano) instead of canned since acidic foods leach more chemicals from the can lining. Half quinoa and half pasta, plus 1/2 can cannellini beans and it was really good. Organic cheese instead of factory farmed. And we SAVE money by eating healthy:)  (and not buying unnecessary chemicals like air and fabric fresheners, etc.)  Thanks for the yummy base recipe!",
