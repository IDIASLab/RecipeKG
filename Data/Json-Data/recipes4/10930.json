Cultural bias I guess. Anyway a hearty bread completes the nutrition and the meal. (I have made fresh rye rolls since the soup is so little effort.) Tomorrow you can have \"instant\" bbq ribs (glaze with favorite sauce and broil to make a crust) carnitas tacos/burritos pulled pork sandwiches meat nachos. And the meat freezes well too.",

I substituted two bags of frozen mixed vegetables (corn green beans carrots etc.) and frozen potatoes as desired and followed everything else but no soy sauce. Well I added a few standard soup seasonings from my kitchen also. Stellar! Wonderful. The ribs add just the right touch of \"weight\" to the vegetables to make the dish hearty. And the soup thickens up over a couple of days very nicely. It gets better over time. You may think the five cups of water is a alot but it's not. You may even want to add more depending on how thin you like your soups. I really don't like the taste of beef in a vegetable soup but I like my soups hearty so this was a perfect option.",
