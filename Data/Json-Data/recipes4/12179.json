I added 3 chopped tomatoes to the onions and mushrooms and sauteed them for an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Finally I added 1/2 teaspoon cumin and 1 teaspoon chili powder and 1 can of mild diced chiles and sauteed for an additional minute or so. I mixed in the cooked millet and beans and stuffed the peppers. I topped the peppers with a sprinkling of mozzarella cheese and bread crumbs and baked them in a preheated oven at 350F for about 45 minutes. The stuffed peppers came out great. I had some of the stuffing mixture left over and I simply baked that along side the stuffed peppers. I will definitely use this recipe again.",

You don't need any more salt. Perhaps pepper garlic and/or onion. After we put it in the peppers I topped them with some bread crumbs and last but not least some shredded parmesan cheese. That was the only cheese I had in the house. We don't microwave anything so we baked it at 350 for 30 min. the recipe says until tender. It came out real good with the suggestions made here.

                "reviewBody": "Great recipe! Only problem was that the bouillon made the millet way to salty. Then again I was using a product called \"Better than Bouillon\". It's always worked great but it must be way saltier than bouillon cubes. Next time if I use \"Better than Bouillon\" I will only use 2 cubes worth. That really was the only learning curb of the whole recipe though. I added a few hardy shakes of \"Mrs. Dash Fiesta Lime\" seasoning salt and that really kick it up a notch. Also stirred in a few glugs of some cheapo picante salsa. A must! I cooked it in the oven not the microwave and it turned out great. Millet can be tricky to cook some times (the outside is mush and inside it crunchy still). This link gives excellent instructions on how to cook millet to perfection. Toasting the millet for a few minutes before boiling really is key! Gives it a fantastic flavor. http://www.vegancoach.com/how-to-prepare-millet.html. Oh! Also added a tablespoon or so of nutritional yeast to add a cheesy flavor. Serve with few good dollops of guacamole and voila! Amazing. Thanks for the excellent recipe!",
