I finished in about 90 minutes, but the majority of that was simmering time, including 30 minutes at the end. I used canned tomatoes and prepared ginger and garlic to save chopping time.  The tip about cooking the onions for a LONG time is right on target; the first time I made this recipe I didn't brown them enough, and the sauce tasted like raw onions.  The second time I browned the onions VERY well and was rewarded with a very mellow flavor.  \r\n\r\nAs for additional seasoning, while there IS a curry plant with leaves that are used in Asian cooking, \"curry powder\" is simply a mixture of many of the spices already used in this recipe (cumin, coriander, turmeric, etc.)  I didn't add any salt to the sauce, but I served the meal with the salt shaker so everyone could salt to taste.",

I have to respond to the other reviews: curry is NOT a seasoning, its a combination of seasonings. Indian dishes are extremely time-consuming and difficult; this is the easiest one I have encountered. And lastly, to compare it to restaurant Indian food is absurd. No one makes burgers like McDonald\u2019s at home. You shouldn't tell an Italian that their spaghetti taste nothing like chef Boyardee, should you? Home made food is always different, if you want cheap restaurant food, go for it.",
