I love it but it didn't take long to see this that this diet horrifies most Americans and is very difficult to find recipes that accomodate my guidelines. I'm always looking for foods that will delight my guests without compromising my hard work. This one makes such a beautiful presentation and so savory they will not even notice how healthy it is! I couldn't wait to try it so just used what I had on hand which meant only 2 cloves of garlic cherry tomatoes and basil from my garden and a well-seasoned stone baking dish (so no oil needed). I sampled it with the 2 vinegars I had: balsamic which was very robust. Used in very small quantity not too bad. My favorite was a delicate unflavored brown rice vinegar. I heaped extra fresh (not cooked) basil for more flavor & it was delicious. Next time will add even more herbs like tarragon chives or rosemary as well. I think cheese would mask the flowery flavor. I will make this often and have fun experimenting variations - thank you for submitting!",

I also added bread crumbs but waited until the foil came off. I cooked it longer than required only because we were grilling and the rest of the food wasn't quite ready. I loved the slightly burned flavor. This is an awesome recipe that lends itself to a myriad of variances. I'll be doing it again!",
