I cut this recipe down by half and used two very large BLSL chicken breasts that I pounded down semi-thin and cut into largish chunks. Before adding the chicken to the casserole I did lightly bread it with a little whole-wheat white flour onion/garlic powder paprika oregano and fresh ground pepper and browned it in a little EVOO. I did not have green onions so I used one small yellow onion. I did make my own cream of chicken soup from scratch (I try my best to make what I can from scratch without using processed products or high fat ingredients) while incorporating a little of the sour cream. I cooked the onions (with a few minced cloves of garlic) after I browned the chicken in the hot EVOO then added a little glug of white wine to deglaze the pan then a cup and a half or so of organic chicken broth. I let the sauce reduce then wisked in about a 1/4 cup or so of reduced fat sour cream and just a touch of fat free half-n-half. Wa-la cream of chicken soup without using processed foods! I'll tell you my family loved this casserole. Even my picky kid who will darn near turn his nose up at anything scarfed two helpings. I had one bite and thought it was heaven. Next time I'll serve this with homemade fluffy biscuits. Just a side salad wasn't enough for my boys. You needed something to soak up the extra sauce!",

What killed it for us was the corn flakes. 4 cups is way too much they overtook the dish. It made it hard to eat and we all tried picking them out. Normally we like that type of thing. I wouldn't even make it with them again I would use either Ritz if I wanted cracker or broken biscuits and I would only use half the amount.",

I believe that some garlic and onions would up the flavor tremendously so the next time I try it I will be adding that. I also think that using shredded or ground chicken would work much better. Chunks/strips were a bit cumbersome, I also think that a cheese mixture would bump up of the flavor. All in all, it is a good recipe but it just needs some modifications for our household.",

There was too much of everything to fit in my 9x13 baking dish. I could probably have gotten by with about half of the chicken and half of the cheese. It also seemed like there wasn't quite enough of the soup/sour cream mixture, so will probably double up on that next time. i was worried about it spilling over in the oven, so put down a sheet of aluminum foil. Thankfully, it didn't spill over. Will enjoy this again and again. Thanks for sharing Holly!",

It is the best casserole I've ever eaten!! My only alterations- I didn't use parmesean cheese because I didn't have any I only used 4 (whole) chicken breasts 4 cups of cheese (6 seemed like too much since I used less chicken I used 98% fat free condensed soup and I didn't add the extra butter at the end. It tasted perfect. I won't change anything for next time except to maybe add an extra cup of cornflakes for the top. Also don't leave out the green onions they add A LOT of flavor!

Had to do some substitution based on what I had: only used 6 chicken breasts substituted 5 cheese Italian blend cheese for 2 cups of the swiss and used crushed club crackers instead of cornflakes. I did saut\u00e9 the mushrooms & green onion together in the pan before I cooked the chicken breast. Also I deglazed the pan with white wine and mixed the cream of chicken soup & sour cream in the pan afterwards. Will definitely make again & again. Thanks! still making it a couple years later. It's easy to throw chicken breasts in the oven while cleaning the kitchen then slice and throw in the fridge for the next day. Made it without sauteing the mushroom and onion still don't use a full 10 chicken breasts always sub 1 sleeve of club crackers crushed for the corn flakes and is still a hit.
