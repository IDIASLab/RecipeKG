Sprayed my pan with some olive oil spray and fried the veggies poured the dry quinoa on top and sprayed it then stirred then added the juice/water. I had no walnuts so i toasted pecans instead they were perfect! I used half the amount of raisins and still though they were a bit much. Next time I will cut back some more and add extra spice 1Tbsp was not enough for us. All in all excellent!",
