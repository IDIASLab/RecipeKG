They were spicier than I expected so I had to use rice and corn in the soup to cut the spice level. My parents loved it so I passed it on to them, then the girls at work loved it so I passed the recipe on to them also. Hopefully, y'all will love it too. It's a nice comfort food. Serve topped with cheese.",
