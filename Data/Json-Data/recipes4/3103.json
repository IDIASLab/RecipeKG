I was missing a few items so took a chance and replaced merlot with cabernet and basalmic with red wine vinegar. (In other words any red wine and vinegar works.) I also added about an eighth a cup of brown sugar. Sorry for obliterating the recipe but my family really liked it. It was a bit too sweet after a full serving for my 9 year old so a full 5 stars to you (since I was the one who added the sugar). On top of garlic mashed potatoes a winner! We will make it again.",
