Ooooh, he loved it so much he ate the whole pan (1 lb) of asparagus, and was slobbering for more.  I probably used 1/2 c freshly shredded parm all said and done.  Thank you!!!",

You can spray a pan with Pam, then you line up the asparagus and shake it a bit so all sides are coated with the spray. Then sprinkle with kosher salt and pepper. Bakes at 450 for 5 minutes. Then sprinkle with paremesan when you pull the pan out of the oven. Baking and spraying with a fat-free cooking spray may make it a bit healthier",

Then, I sprinkled on the cheese to taste about 1/3 of a cup or less and microwaved 1 more minute. I sprinkled on a little salt when I took them out of the microwave. I didn't mean to change the cooking method but, I did it out of ease. And, I used all of the ingredients listed, but scaled them back to cut a few calories. In the end delicous!",
