But a quick question...I have heard that you need to let the venison \"sit\" in vinegar or lemon juice to get the \"odor\" out before you prepare it. Would that be the same thing you are doing when you put the \"kiwi and red wine\" in it? Thanks!",

I made this recipe as written using all of the listed ingredients with the exception of the mushrooms. Not because I didn t have them but my family is not a fan of them. I used Barefoot Cabernet Sauvignon for the wine and my family was not impressed. They said the taste of the wine overpowered the dish. The recipe calls for balsamic vinegar giving no measurements so I added 3 TB as did a previous reviewer. The ingredients were in the slow cooker on low for about 8 hours. Family said the meat and veggies were cooked perfectly but they could not get past the wine taste. I found this odd since they are both wine drinkers. They are not sorry that they tried this recipe it gave them a chance to try a new vegetable parsnip but I am sorry that I am leaving a low star rating. I may give this another try sometime but I will use a different wine choice.",
