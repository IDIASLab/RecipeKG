Perfect amount of vanilla and eggs. I didn't have a glass pie dish so I baked it in my round glass casserole dish for an extra fifteen minutes and it came out smooth and creamy and light and fluffy. Gorgeous! Totally didn't need the whipped cream I made for it. Thanks so much for this recipe! (I didn't have pumpkin pie spice either so I stole a list of spices from a different recipe - I don't remember which one but I'm sure it's similar).",
