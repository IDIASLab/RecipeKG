Use leftover banana from recipe mixed with whipped cream for a low sugar topping! These waffles are very dense because of the almond flour. My family can usually finish 1, maybe 1 1/2 waffles a person if serving with other things like eggs or meats. We like to use the leftover banana mush mixed with whipped cream and butter to top them.",
