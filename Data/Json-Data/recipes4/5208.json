I roasted mine in a 400 degree oven alongside the fish I prepared for dinner. Both were done in 15 minutes (as a point of reference my asparagus were on the thicker side) For a seasoning twist I used Penzey's Chicago Steak Seasoning instead of just ground pepper. Easier and five-star excellent if simply roasted in the oven period.",

I baked it at 475 for about 12 minutes and then broiled it for about 4 minutes. I added the lemon juice prior to cooking and it kept that vibrant green color. I added a little salt as well. I did skip the steaming as we prefer a little crunch to our asparagus. This is a wonderful recipe and I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe and thanks for the tips.",
