With that being said 2 onions were plenty. I also only used 3 carrots out of personal preference. I wanted the potatoes to be the star. The recipe does not state to do so but you need to peel the onion carrots and potatoes prior to grating. This turned out good and if I were to make again I'd add some herbs.",
