My fish rack for the BBQ wasn't big enough so I ended up making a big foil pouch. I cooked it on one side for 10 minutes and then 8 on the second side. When we split the pouch open the bacon was cooked but not enough so we threw it on the grill for a minute or two then chopped it up and sprinkled it over the cooked fish. (FYI - 1 pound of snapper / rock fish is about 5 fillets) Delicious. We served it with the Fresh Tomato Salad recipe (also found on allrecipes.com) which was a perfect pairing. YUM! We'll definately make again!",

Please note I'm only rating this at 4-stars as I made some changes mostly because a) it was raining b) I don't have a \"fish rack\" for my grill and c) did I mention it was raining.:) Nonetheless after wife and I consumed my version I'm sure Curt's version with appropriate attentiveness would definitely rank 5-stars. I had an 8-oz. Snapper filet in the fridge that needed to be used. So what I did was preheat my convection oven's broiler put 4 \"thin\" slices of red onion on the rack of my boiler pan put the Snapper on those onions (skin-side down) lightly seasoned with Old Bay topped that with 4 more slices of red onion then 6 half-strips of bacon laid \"crosswise \" overlapping each about 1/8 inch. I slipped that into the oven with the top of the bacon about 5 inches from the broiler elements and checked it until the bacon looked \"done \" about 30-35 minutes. Fish flaked perfectly bacon was \"just\" crispy and some of the onion was partially caramelized. Sweet juicy and delicious. Almost can't wait until I get a \"fish rack\" for my grill to try Curt's recipe as written. Until then I'll definitely do this as above again... wife's still raving about it might even try it with walleye grouper or sea bass.",
