She is not really a Macaroni and Cheese person herself but she loves making it for people.  I tried Chuck's recipe this past Thanksgiving and it blew my Mom's out of the water.  Sorry Mom!  She agrees with me also.  I am originally from California and we had this restaurant in downtown Los Angeles called Clifton's Cafeteria and I thought that they made the best Macaroni and Cheese in the entire world.  Well, I have finally found the recipe for it.  Thank you Chuck for bringing back wonderful memories and for one of the best recipes on this site.  By the way, my Mom actually loves Macaroni and Cheese now, and is always wanting me to make Chuck's Favorite Mac and Cheese.  It is now my family's favorite too.  ",

Some suggestions though which most people have already mentioned:  The amount of bread crumbs needs to seriously be reduced.  Instead of 1 cup, I would only use a 1/4 of a cup with the 1/4 of melted butter.  This will provide a light garnishment on top of your dish.  Mmmmm...also add a 1/2 cup of milk.  If not, your leftovers will be dry as a bone.  A tasty bone, but still quite dry.  Happy eating!!!  :)",

I make it exactly as directed except skip the breadcrumbs and cover the top in a thick layer of cheese instead. It is interesting to read all the mixed reviews on this mac and cheese, because depending upon what part of the country you are from, people eat different kinds of mac and cheese. Some people like creamy and some people like it the way this one is made. The mac and cheese that I am used to making and eating that taste like this is made with egg. The cottage cheese in this recipe gives the same consistency of that without the egg, and I like that. Thanks so much! This recipe has really been a great find for me!",
