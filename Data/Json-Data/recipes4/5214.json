This recipe came about in an effort to use up a few more of those wonderful home-grown tomatoes and fresh basil. Everything was on hand and was easy to throw together. For garlic lovers, the second time I made this dish I used a garlic-infused olive oil; amazing! A crisp green salad is the perfect accompaniment. Enjoy!",

The step with the pasta water was only intended to be used if you needed more sauce, please don't dump it all in!",

I chopped my tomatoes (didn't bother seeding) in the morning and added the sea salt, pepper and EV olive oil - then refrigerated it all day.  I set it on the counter for about 2 hours before using them to come to room temp.  By doing so, it created enough broth that I didn't need the pasta water when mixing it all together.  I had never tried, nor bought prosciutto before.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it.   This meal came together quickly and made for a pretty presentation.  I served it with a toss salad and rolls.  We both LOVED it and will be having it again soon with all the tomatoes we have left in the garden.  DH said the leftovers were great for lunch the next day, always a plus.  Thanks Wyattdogster for sharing this recipe.  It is a \"winner\"!",

To avoid the possibility of tough skins I peeled my garden tomatoes by scalding for 30 seconds and then placing in cold water - the skins slipped right off. I was a little leary of adding the full amount of oil called for even though olive oil is the healthy oil but I did as the directions stated and didn't regret it. The tomato mixture made enough of its own juice that the addition of the pasta water was not necessary for me. I didn't have shallots so I diced up some onion instead. Followed the rest of the instructions as indicated and topped with Parmesan cheese. I had never had prosciutto before and although I didn't care for the proscuitto on its own it was a good addition to this recipe. I loved the simplicity of this recipe and the light fresh flavor. What could be better than fresh tomatoes and basil in the summertime? Thanks for the tasty recipe Laurie!",

I didn't have any fresh garden tomatoes and had to buy from the grocery store. The nicest looking tomatoes were plum tomatoes. I chopped them up with seeds skins and everything nature gave them. I let them sit with the basil at room temperature for a good two hours in the olive oil. Luckily these were exceptional tomatoes and I was amazed at how much juice they made. I had no need for the extra water. I've never had prosciutto but was happy to find fresh sliced to order in the deli of our grocery store. My son had his girlfriend over and all four of us ate every last bite. This was really an easy summer meal so few ingredients and yet so full of satisfying flavor in every bite. I certainly will make this again and again. Thanks Wyattdogster I would never have thought this one up on my own. Just wonderful!",

My daughter couldn't keep her fork out of the bowl - I thought I wasn't going to have anything left for dinner! She said it tasted just like bruschetta.

I prepared the tomatoes as written then I cut the pattypan squash and sauteed it in a mixture of butter and EVOO with 4 cloves of garlic and half a large sweet onion diced. When the vegetables were almost ready I added my pancetta which was diced to just crisp it a bit and boiled my pasta. At this point I added my tomatoes and the pasta to the pan and tossed it all together. I served it on individual plates with freshly grated parmesan and fresh ground black pepper. I didn't need any additional water. This was very well received in fact I thought my son in law was going to lick his plate.
