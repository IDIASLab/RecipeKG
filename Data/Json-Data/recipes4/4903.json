I was looking for a quick and easy casserole recipe using chicken and rice but no condensed soups and came upon this one that fit the bill perfectly! I only used half of the recommended sour cream and cream cheeses and used real garlic (chopped) and onions and no dill or parsley. The flavor of this recipe is really good! My hubby loved it! I used Don Julios hot sauce and it was fantastic. Not TOO spicy but just enough kick. I will say the recipe was a bit dry but maybe if I had used the full amounts of cream cheese and sour cream it would have been less dry. When we have reheated it for eating leftovers I add a bit of milk and a spoon of cheese and it's just plain good! I will make this again!",

I didn't have onion powder so I minced up some onion and I only put 2 Tbsp hot sauce because of my kids (hubby and I added more Franks Red Hot to our plates). I used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese and mixed light sour cream with a little regular. This would be pretty fattening to eat all the time but I will make it again! Very good.",

But, I'm pregnant and had some of what this recipe called for and didn't feel like portioning out the spices.  So, here's what happened:\n\n I grilled the chicken on the Foreman with fajita seasoning for flavor.  Put a bunch of pre-cooked rice in a frying pan added a Savory Garlic Philadelphia Cooking Creme, some chicken broth, and some Frank's Red Hot sauce.  It's fantastic.  \n\nNow I can't wait to try the real recipe . . . though I am going to estimate the nutrition facts on my lazy interpretation.\n\nThanks, Samantha for the inspiration!",
