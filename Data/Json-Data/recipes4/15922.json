I originally tried it because I felt the need for some greens and all that kale and cabbage fit the bill! Like the previous reviewer I was surprised to find it a tad bland considering all the garlic and spice but I added some tumeric for colour and then a little onion powder and just under a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and it really gave it that little kick I felt it needed. I wanted to try some ginger in it but didn't have any on hand. And finally I grated a generous amount of old white cheddar on top and it tasted just great. Even my husband and my toddler loved it! Thanks much for the recipe!",

I think the beef pieces put it closer to a 4.5 on our rating scale as we do like actual meat in the soup. The \"beef base\" I used was a homemade concentrate. It may have been more concentrated and with more seasonings than others might have used and that may be the reason we didn't find it lacking in flavor as some other reviewers did.",
