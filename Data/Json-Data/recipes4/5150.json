You loose too much of the flavor of the pepper.  The peel comes off easily if you steam them in the bowl after roasting long enough.  And I just pull the seeds out with my fingers (if a few are left behind, no big deal) and I pat them inside and out with paper towels.  Works great!",

I have made rellenos before using a different (but similar) batter and I think the baking powder and dip in the flour makes all the difference.    The only things I can suggest is some method tweeking.  I have always removed the seeds PRIOR to broiling.  It was very difficult to remove the insides while the pepper was so soft and easy to tear.  And the batter - I would suggest placing some of the egg batter into the oil and place the pepper on top and then spoon some more of the batter on top of the pepper and form it around the chile with a spatula.  It sounds like a lot but it is easy and provides better coverage and is less messy.  Taste was right on!  I have a homemade salsa made of romas & serranos that I warm and put over the relleno.",

I made some for my friends and now I'm basically being forced to make choke rellenos against my will every time there is a gathering. So be careful with this recipe.\n\nI'm not sure where people are getting the idea that you have to use Hatch peppers to be authentic. While delicious...\n\n\"The chile relleno (Spanish pronunciation: ['t?ile re'?eno], literally \"stuffed chile\"[1]) is a dish of Mexican cuisine that originated in the city of Puebla. It consists of a stuffed, roasted, fresh poblano pepper (a mild chili pepper named after the city of Puebla), sometimes substituted with a non-traditional Hatch chile, Anaheim, pasilla or even jalape\u00f1o chili pepper. \" -wiki (chile rellenos)\n\nSo use whatever peppers you have on hand.
