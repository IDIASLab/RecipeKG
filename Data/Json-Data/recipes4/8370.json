For optimum flavor, these must be baked in hot, buttered cast iron skillets. They are great for breakfast with gravy or jellies. Also excellent with beef stew for dinner. My husband likes the leftover biscuits even better. He breaks them open on a plate and smothers them with molasses.",

These are really light and flaky and easy to make. The only changes I made were to up the buttermilk from 1 1/3 cups to 2 cups, so they weren\u2019t as dry and also I added 1/4 cup of white sugar. They are excellent!! The added buttermilk really made a difference, but it added about 5-8 minutes to the baking time. \nI have made these biscuits twice now, even adding shredded sharp cheddar cheese to have them alongside my chowder. Really, really yummy!! I\u2019m keeping this recipe!!",

I cut the recipe in half and made larger biscuits, so, my dough gave me eight biscuits.  They took 17 minutes to cook and were golden brown.   My biscuits did not get too dark on the bottom and were lightly browned with a slight crunch.  The inside of the biscuit was dense and not fluffy like I like in a biscuit, but, more than likely that is my fault.  I typically tend to work the dough to much and end up with a tough biscuit.",
