This dish reminds me of exactly that one although this one is baked...I am in love with it and it will remain part of our family's go-to meals. I made a few changes/additions: used 1 pouch of Uncle Ben's Natural Whole Grain Brown rice (only one pouch not two as the recipe calls for) and I added black beans and corn. Served with sour cream.

Uncle Ben's pouch rice did not taste chemically or have that weird \"processed foods\" texture. Now that accolades have been written here's how I view the recipe from my preference. I found that this recipe is nothing more than 10 minute Spanish rice with the sodium content connected to prepackaged foods. That in itself is reason I would not purchase this product but I respect everyone's needs and opinions. If you use this product I suggest \"making it your own\" by add-ins - veggies olives more distinct spices. Thank you Uncle Ben's Rice for the opportunity to test your recipe and product.",

This certainly came together quickly and I think the recipe itself is good my only disappointment was with the rice itself (which also is very high in sodium). The Garden Vegetable Ready Rice certainly is not inexpensive in relation to cooking your own rice and although it had carrots peas and corn in it I couldn t taste them and visually you really couldn t see them either (we do eat with our eyes). The good taco flavor certainly is there and this is not to say that we didn t enjoy this but I think I d simply use regular Uncle Ben s long grain rice for this recipe and get the sodium under control. But I also have to say that Ready Rice certainly is easy and fast and may just be what many families are looking for.",
