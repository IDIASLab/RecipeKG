I omitted zucchini as I have always hated it and added one medium diced potato.  I used half a chicken stock cube (Knorr) for the broth base.  \r\nAlthough this would feed two, it was all the better for being just one!  I polished off the lot and it tasted great.  When I told my husband what I had for lunch he promptly looked around and said \"Where's mine?\".  I have promised to make it for him and the kids.  Can't praise this simple soup enough and the garlic just added that necessary kick.  Great!",

I cut up half a zuchini and sauteed it in a pan because I think it adds flavor. Our family had eaten roasted chicken the night before so I used the left over chicken from the bones in the soup. I also spooned all the juices from the dish in which I baked the chicken into a jar and stored it in the fridge. When the vegetables were nearly done and I was adding the chicken and sauteed zuchini, I also added the broth! Delicious. My husband and I devoured the soup with a whole fresh baguette and butter!",
