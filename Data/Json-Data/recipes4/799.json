There were rave reviews from my family and friends for this labor day get together we had tonight and they want this to be a regular recipe in our household. I did take a users advice to use Rhodes Texas Rolls and once I got tired of rolling one roll at a time I started squishing two together and rolling that to make a larger runza which were ate up easily. And that made it all a little easier. Oh yeah season to suit your own taste... I liked Jane's Crazy Salt Mix for this recipe. One last change... I used melted butter on the runza's instead of oil. Thanks for the recipe this was AWESOME!!! PS. For picky cabbage haters it cooks down alot and you don't really taste it much it is more of a filler in these great sandwiches.",
