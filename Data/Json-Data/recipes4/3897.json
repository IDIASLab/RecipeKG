I had a large piece of salmon so I took the skin off and used that it was almost the size of the dough but not quite. I followed the directions but used fresh spinach which I tossed in a tablespoon of olive oil first. I covered with the second sheet of dough and pinched all the edges together. I coated with the egg white and topped with a teaspoon of chopped shallots. My company raved about it and insisted on the recipe.",

I took leftovers for lunch the next day. I would recommend a toaster oven and not a microwave to reheat. Thanks for the wonderful recipe we will be eating it again soon.",

I had a wonderful Sock-eye salmon filet and the flavor of the salmon was overpowered a bit. My daughter said all she could taste was the mustard even though I had cut back on it. I still think it's a good recipe and I might not attempted it had it not seemed and was so easy. I am looking forward to trying it again but will have to tweak it some more to suit our tastes. ( I didn't have mayo so used Miracle Whip and that didn't seem to matter but will get real mayo for next time.)We still ate half of it and will enjoy the other half tomorrow. I cut the filet in half and wrapped each half in the puff pastry. I love that stuff.... never used it before!!",
