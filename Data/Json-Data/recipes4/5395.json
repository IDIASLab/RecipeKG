The whole 9 x 13 pan was eaten between the 4 of us!! Chomp chomp delicious!!",

I followed three suggestions.  I cut the milk to two cups and increased the ham to two cups.  I would use even more next time.  And I used long grain rice instead of minute rice which I don't like anyway.  I found that the dish was almost burned on the bottom and edges.  Next time I will cook covered for only one hour and uncovered for a half hour.  It was at least a nice change from scalloped potatoes and ham..",
