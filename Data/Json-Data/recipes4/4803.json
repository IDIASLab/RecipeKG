I also swapped out half of the corn syrup for pure maple syrup, and increased the butter because, well, it was the apocalypse and all. :) Absolutely delicious, and so easy. Thanks, mominml!",

I never have the frozen dinner rolls so I used some white yeast bread dough that I made today it worked perfectly. Also I didn't quite have 1/2 cup of blackberry jam so I ended up using strawberry jam towards the end. It was fine but the blackberry ones were a million times better:) Made the glaze as is and it was fine but next time I think I'll do a vanilla glaze using powdered sugar. Thanks for the recipe wish I had leftovers!",
