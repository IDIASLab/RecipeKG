I did make a few adjustments:  I used 4 cups cubed russet potatoes, 1 1lb. bag frozen broccoli flowets, 1 c. chopped onion as I thought 2 cups would be over powering,  in place of the bouillion cubes and 5 cups of water I used 2 14oz. cans chicken broth and 1 cup water  also added 3 crushed garlic cloves, and only used 8 oz. sharp cheddar cheese.  I cooked the broccoli in with the potatoes as other reviewers suggested and then pureed 1/2 the soup and it turned out nice and creamy.  This  will be a regular in our house during the winter months. Thanks Ruth for sharing this 5 ***** recipe.",

I sauteed the onion, added a clove of garlic, fresh ground pepper and a handful of baby carrots, then just cooked them all with the potatoes and broccoli in the broth. I pureed the entire thing (use a blender--a food processor splatters!) and tasted it. It was so delicious that I decided the cheese was optional. It also did not require any additional salt. I'm serving it tonight with homemade garlic croutons and just a sprinkle of sharp cheddar. Thank you for this wonderful, adaptable recipe. It's now in my recipe box and on my list of ideas for food to bring to sick friends. I'll bet you could easily turn this into a delicious vegan meal by using vegetable broth and omitting the cheese.",

I used olive oil instead of butter added way less cheese and I didn't see the importance of cooking the broc seperately.. it can be added a little after the potatoes and boils fine... This was great.

The first time I followed the recipe as written. Yum! The second time I added garlic with the onion, I added fresh carrots with the broccoli, and I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream just to see how it would taste. Both ways are really good, so if you are creative, create away; either way you're going to have a great soup.",
