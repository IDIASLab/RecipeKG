I used half a garlic and herb tenderloin that I had left from the Indonesian Pork Noodle Bowl and because I didn't have quite enough Panko left I smashed some Rice Krispies for the coating. We used Honey Mustard II from this site and Semigourmet's version of ranch dressing. I will have to get more of this delicious pork tenderloin again for a repeat! I didn't even have time to take a photo! Thanks #Smithfield for a wonderful recipe!",
