Anyway, what you are missing is a layer of potatoes in the middle. The original dish is layered so that you first put a layer of potatoes on the bottom, than a layer of meat, a layer of potatoes in the middle, than another layer of meat, than top it off with another layer of potatoes. Otherwise, the dish would be too heavy on the meat side. Also, there is an allspice that is greatly used in that region, which adds a specific taste to the original dish. The spice is called \"vegeta\" and you can find it in many international markets.\n\nIf you make it without that spice, make sure to add some spices to the potatoes before you layer them. I usually add salt, pepper, paprika and some parsley. Enjoy!",

Despite layering the potatos on top & bottom, there was still an overabundance of meat. (While we all like meat, we ended up having to heat up so leftover rice to accompany the dish.) Some nice ideas might be to serve it with egg noodles, rice or to use MUCH more potato (and perhaps mix the potatos in with the meat prior to baking?) On a separate note, I would definitely recommend including the ground cloves. I'm not a huge \"clove\" fan either, but I used it anyway and the result was fantastic! (If you are still wary, try a dash instead of a pinch...trust me, your taste buds will thank you.)  Again, a thoroughly tasty dish which everyone loved...just lacking some starch accompaniment.",

Add two cloves garlic, part with the ground beef to be ground, part with the vegetables when cooked. Add 2.5 times potatoes - about 1/2 chopped in smallish cubes in the mix of ground beef and vegetables, plus bit more spices and wine. I simply pushed the ground beef to the side after browning and cooked the vegetables on the other side of the pan...

This will be a regular at my house....but will be known as the garbage dish.....I had part of a pepper, part of an onion, a small amount of red wine from the night before, potatoes that needed to be used up.....and this dish used up all the leftover stuff so I didn't have to toss it!

I did make a few changes. I didn't bother with the olive oil, because the dripping from the beef were sufficent to do the vegetables. I cut the black pepper down to 1/4 tspn and reduced the red pepper flakes to a pinch based on the reviews I read that the dish was spicy. Even with those reductions the dish had plenty of spice, but also stayed \"kid friendly\" for my 4 and 6 year old. I also doubled the salt and added garlic powder. The 2 tblsn of half and half cream you add at the end of preperation seemed not to really contribute any real taste or texture ( cream-like )quality to the dish, so when I make this again, I will probably omit it. Also next time I make this recipe I will add more potatos, because the ratio potatos/meat is heavily on the meat side. I think I will cube 1 or 2 potatos mixing it up with the beef and still using sliced potatos for the top and bottom.",

It was interesting, but in a good way.  There were a couple of things I did a little different from the original recipe.  I browned the beef and then put the veggies and seasonings in (I would have liked to have figured out how to do it in one pan, but didn't want to press my luck).  I couldn't figure out why you needed to take the beef out or add the extra oil.  It turned out just fine.  Next time I would only use one rib of celery and cut it up fine since my onion and red pepper (didn't have green) were chopped up fine.  I also didn't have any half and half, but I had sour cream and I added 2 tablespoons and it was fine.  This was fast and easy and tastey.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!",
