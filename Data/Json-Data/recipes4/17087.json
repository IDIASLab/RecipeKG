I normally cut down the chocolate milk because it really deletes the coffee part so I suggest lessening the amount and doing from one cup to one and a half only. Besides that it's super good. Also if you add a bit of maple syrup it makes it all the more sweeter and summery. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!",

I think using a stronger coffee for the ice cubes would help that. Definitely try this and if you like coffee then bump it up by using espresso or increase the instant coffee granules per water ratio. Thank you for your recipe.",
