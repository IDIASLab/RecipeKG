                "reviewBody": "So I hit done too soon! My biggest changes were to speed up the process to get under my 45 minute mark. First - I pull the tofu out of the fridge open and drain. I squeeze out the water real quick then wrap in a tea towel and really pat it down. Then turn it out into a large mixing bowl. Then - I mash it using a wire potato masher just enough that it resembles cooked ground beef. Lastly I press my tea towel down on it stir the tofu and do it again? And again and again. Whole process takes 5 minutes. Another speedy tip is to use dried herbs (a rounded 1/4 tsp a piece). I then used my #50 portion scoop (1 1/2 Tbsp) to quickly make 30 meatballs (I rolled them in my palms before setting them on foil-lined baking tray). Lastly I saved time by zapping each meatball with canola oil cooking spray. My last comment was that since I used whole-wheat Panko I added an extra egg. I have been trying to find a decent meat-free meatball recipe for years and this was finally it! After I popped them in the oven for 25 minutes I made spaghetti heated some sauce and steamed some broccoli. Dinner in 45;). Can t wait to make meatball sandwiches with the leftovers",

I've tried cooking tofu sliced and diced. I don't like it. Tofu has no flavor and will take on the favor of the ingredients. That's why this recipe is perfect for tofu. The only thing I would do different for me personally is cut the red pepper flakes and hot sauce in half. If you like spicy food don't change a thing you will love it as is. I cooked mine and added tomato sauce before refrigerating. This made them too mushy. I would cook them as directed and use tomato sauce as a dip.",
