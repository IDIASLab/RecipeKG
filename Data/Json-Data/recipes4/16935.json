I added two cans of hominy and doubled the amount of water and bouillon powder because I thought it was too much chicken and the soup was going to be very dry. When you eat pozole the main ingredient is the hominy and one can is not enough for eight servings as the recipe suggests. With these changes the recipe was balanced and very similar to any one you eat in Mexico. The toppings that the traditional Mexican recipe uses are: chilli powder, chopped onion, lime juice, dried oregano, sliced or chopped radish and shredded lettuce. Yes, lettuce not cabbage. Even though they look very similar their flavor is completely different and it can affect the experience of eating pozole quiet considerably. We enjoyed our pozole with tostadas on the side . Usually you top your tostadas with cream, lettuce and avocado and if you like  salsa you can added it too.\nI'm  definitely making pozole blanco in the slow cooker again.",

I've always thought it was because I'm not a huge fan of hominy but there is something about this recipe that changed my opinion on the matter. This was EXCELLENT! The only change I made is that I used the last of my Poblano pepper from the garden but it would have been just as good with jalapeno. This is one that needs no tweaking just don't forget the toppings. This will be my go to Pozole recipe from now on!",

That being said, this tasted really good and I will make it again with a couple of changes. 1. I recommend leaving the chicken breast whole. This will make shredding them so much easier. 2. Add the hominy about 30 minutes before your ready to eat. It is already cooked and only needs to heat up. If you add it at the beginning it pretty much cooks to mush. 3. I also recommend bumping up the spices just a bit. Maybe adding a bit of cumin.",
