I swapped coconut water for the coconut milk fresh collard greens for the spinach dark cocoa powder for the cacao seeds 2 teaspoons sugar for the stevia and added 10-15 extra mint leaves and left out the extract. I also just chilled the banana while preparing the other ingredients and tossed in a couple ice cubes because I was in a hurry. My sister added 2% milk to hers to dilute it. We both loved it. You can't taste the collard greens but I think the bitterness of fresh greens subtly enhances the chocolate taste. Will be making this again!",

I tried fixing it by adding more water and spinach and then by adding a scoop of chocolate protein powder. It was still too strong. I'll try it again but I'll sub fresh mint for the mint extract or only put a very tiny amount of extract in. UPDATE (7/16/214): I made this again only this time I doubled the use of fresh mint and didn't use any mint extract at all. It was much better this time so I increased my initial rating. Still as I wouldn't make the recipe as listed again I am rating this as a 3 (my modified version was more like a 4 but the original version was a 1).",

Several of the 5 star reviews I read said they cut down on the extract or just used the mint leaves and left out the extract.
