It is a good dish, but a fun dish. and I think that those who did not like it, did not (1) know how to serve it, (2) it is NOT a stew!  The name is misleading because there is no gravy to speak of, it is just boiled food in one pot, but very tasty.\n\nIt is just an \"ole Fashion\" crab .... shrimp, boil! with your entire meal in one pot!  I think this recipe had a few mistakes in it.  You should start with the corn on the cob (regardless if it is fresh or frozen) First,  because it takes longer to cook, actually I boiled my corn in a separate pot, and in my main pot I had the bay seasoning boiling.  Then I'd commence to add  the potatoes, and  then the sausage, and in the last 4 minutes I threw in the seafood, and my already cooked corn.",

I always serve this on newspaper and no utensils or plates are allowed, fingers only.  A roll of paper towels is set on the table to use as napkins and it is served with several condiments, cocktail sauce, barbeque sauce and melted butter.  It\u2019s a lot of fun!",

I did cut it in half as I was only serving 4 of us. I LOVED the presentation and will do this over and over again. Served it with sour cream cocktaill sauce and lots of paper towels. I sprinkled Old Bay over it and squeezed a lemon over it after I dumped it on the table then left the Old Bay out for the guys as they like spicier foods. Beer is an essential side kick for this recipe. Don't hesitate to try this one! An Update: Made this during a trip to Australia for our New Year's Eve dinner (very hot weather). Couldn't find Andouille sausage down under so we used reg. spicy sausage but thick cut it on the diagonal and sauted it ahead in olive oil. Worked great! One thought would be to add some liquid smoke to the saute next time to get that smokey flavor. Yum!",

I had no idea what to expect with so few ingredients \u2013 the results were amazing. I had my parents over for dinner & we all LOVED IT.
