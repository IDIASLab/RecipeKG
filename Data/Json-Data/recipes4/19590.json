I turned them into cheesecake bites using a mini cupcake pan and here are the changes I made:\n\nCrust- I used 2/3 cup super fine almond flour, 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1 tablespoon of swerve,  1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract and half the amount of butter in the original recipe.  Once mixed, spoon 1 teaspoon into the wells, press down and bake (without cheesecake mixture) for 7 minutes on 350. Take them out to cool while mixing cheesecake. The super fine almond flour yields a crust similar to a shortbread cookie without the chewy, nutty taste you get with almond meal. Note: You'll need to double the crust recipe if using super fine almond flour to accommodate the amount of filling.\n\nCheesecake-  No changes made.",

I did double the recipe for the crust I used 1 1/3 cup almond flour, 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon, 2 tablespoons of Swerve, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 5 tablespoons of butter.  This was suggested by another reviewer I also pre-baked it at 350 for 7 minutes.  I sprayed my muffin tin with coconut oil and that actually was an added bonus because you could have the crust with a hint of coconut flavor.",
