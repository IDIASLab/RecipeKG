Using this much I had to use 4 times the mustard mixture. For the pretzels I crushed a pound bag of the big sourdough hard pretzels. I didn't crush them to \"flour \" but left small pieces. The crust stayed crunchy and was so good! I didn't use the recipe for the honey mustard to drizzle on the top because we had some Ken's Light Honey Mustard dressing already. We used that as a dip and it was perfect!",
