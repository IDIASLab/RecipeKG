First, I used beefy onion soup mix since that's what I had and I much prefer it over the plain onion soup mix anyway. I did add the packet of au jus gravy mix, 1/2 cup red wine for half of the water, and for extra liquid to accomodate the larger roast, an 8-oz. carton of beef stock. I also added 2 tsp. of Italian seasoning. I cooked it on low, about 7 hours, then chilled it overnight. The cold meat is firm and slices perfectly, which I like better than shredding it. The meat was melt in your mouth tender and richly flavorful, as was the au jus, which I served in ramekins alongside the sandwich. On a buttered hoagie or sub roll, this was just delicious, even without the cheese! ",

The best part about doing that for me was that all of the fat came to the top and solidified .....just used a spoon and it all came right off in solid form....so I felt better about using the drippings to dip these wonderful sandwiches. Our company loved them, served on rolls with swiss cheese. Just delicious! Thanks!",

Once this was shredded I put it back in the juice to cook for a couple more hours. I toasted a hoagie roll added a little mayo & spicy mustard then the meat & cheese - popped it back in the oven just to melt cheese - then a little lettuce & tomato. Added a little bowl of the jus for dipping. WOW! The result was one fabulous sandwich! Loved Loved Loved it! One note: This cut makes definitely has a lot of fat. So be SURE to remove as much as you can when shredding the meat AND definitely chill and remove the floating fat or use a fat-separating pitcher then pour the jus back over the meat.",
