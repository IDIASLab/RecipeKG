For us russets make the best potato salad because they do sort of fall apart unlike red skinned potatoes which adds to the creaminess. I don't usually put red peppers in potato salad but it was a nice addition. (Black olives would be good too.) I would suggest using good judgement on the amount of onion one very small onion would be fine but if you have a really large onion adjust accordingly. Thanks for a solid recipe Emily.",
