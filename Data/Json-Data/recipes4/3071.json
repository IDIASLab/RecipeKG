I chopped up a large onion and minced up 3 cloves of garlic. I sauteed them in about 3 tbsp of EVOO. Then I added fresh baby spinach (about 3 or 4 bags worth) to the pan and let it wilt down. Then I transferred it to a large bowl where I added the Ricotta Cheese Parmesan cheese garlic powder garlic salt S&P 1/2 cup of roasted red peppers that I ran my knife through first and I added about 2/3 cup of Italian Style Bread crumbs and mixed well. Then I took the chicken breasts and put the spinach mixture in the middle of the chicken breast and rolled it up. I wrapped 2 slices of bacon on each and placed them in the baking dish and baked at 400 degrees until chicken was down and juices ran clear and then broiled it on low until bacon got a bit crispy and the chicken browned a bit. I had extra stuffing and placed in a zip lock freezing bag and put it in the freezer for future use.",

I simply slice a \"pocket\" in the breast instead of pounding it and insert brie cheese with course grain mustard and veg.

A lot of my work mates make this and we advise each other on new variations. A good basic recipe that you can do a million ways to suit your tastes. Not to mention it impresses company.:)",

                "reviewBody": "I decided to cook this dish for 12 people who were all bacon lovers thankfully because the amount of bacon that the recipe called for created quite an excess amount of bacon grease that filled half the pan. It does not present that well to serve the chicken in a dish full of grease so I would recommend removing them to a separate dish before serving and perhaps using the \"pat dry\" method with a paper towel to remove the excess. I also added chopped pine nuts in the olive oil with the garlic to give the creamy filling some crunchy variation which turned out to be great. Overall a tasty dish but a bit heavy. We all know that anything cooked in bacon fat = delicious but this is not a low calorie meal.",
