That being said, we're giving this one 5 stars.  I can see how some of the suggested additions/adjustments could be good as well, but the recipe is wonderful as is.  The aroma, flavor and texture were all good enough that I could see this soup served at a fine restaurant.  The ingredients all worked together very well and there wasn't anything that seemed out of place.  I was worried about the dill and thought it would overpower but it definitely does not.  \n\nI can see how some people might find this soup to be a little on the heavy side (with the half-and-half and the butter) or salty side (with the use of regular chicken broth), but personally I don't think anything needs to be done.  I think it's a good fall soup worth trying.",

This soup is comforting, rich, delicious, and not your ordinary potato soup but out of this world!  I substituted onions for leeks, and added 1/2 cup sour creme in addition to half and half.  I used portabella mushrooms rather than button mushrooms for richer flavor.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!",

I found that the cream and flour mixture to thicken the soup wasn't necessary IF you blend at least half the soup before adding the mushrooms.  The blended potato made it chowder-like.  I also added a dollop of sour cream for a nice tart flavor, and shredded cheese on top.  LOVE IT!",
