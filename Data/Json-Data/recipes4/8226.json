I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting mozzarella for the scamorza. It was the best thing I have eaten in a long time and possibly the most delicious meal I have ever cooked. Light but filling the eggs fluff up like a souffle and the combination of the herbs is beautiful. It even smells fantastic. Many thanks for sharing this incredible recipe.",
