I used 12 chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.  That being said.....\n\nIt was delicious!  There was a subtle citrus taste that may have been missed with the other ingredients.  The chicken was very moist and delicious.  Perfect for a summer meal.",

Instead of grilling over hickory chips I smoked them in a smoker with hickory chips. I've smoked quite a few cornish but this batch was by far the most juicy and tender I've ever had. If I were not completely sold on brining a bird prior to cooking it, this recipe would have sold me.  Excellent recipe and 5 stars all the way!",
