Unfortunately, there are some problems with the recipe as I see it.  First, you'll need more of the ground almonds/Parmesan to coat your filets - I ran short. Second, medium-high is too high a temperature, especially since you're frying these in butter, which has a low burning temperature.  I used medium heat to fry the fish in a mixture of butter and olive oil. Third, after frying the fish on each side for 3 minutes, it was done!  I can't imagine cooking it another 5 minutes once you sprinkled it with more Parmesan, which leads me to four, MORE Parmesan cheese?  No - there's plenty in the mixture the filets were coated with.  And you sure don't want to cover it, which would only turn the coating soggy. So in a nutshell, fry the fish coated with a mix of Parmesan and ground almonds (the seasonings were fine) for a few minutes on each side on medium heat in a mixture of olive oil and butter.  Serve.",

I did not add the lemon (I didn't have any on hand), and I added a salt-free garlic and herb mixture to the eggs instead of what the recipe called for. Once the tilapia was coated, I put it on a baking sheet, sprayed it with some cooking spray, and cooked it at 375 for about 30 minutes. The coating was crispy and the fish was moist. Thanks for such a fabulous recipe!",

It is definitely better than the other tilapia recipe on the site (Broiled Parmesan Tilapia) although both are good. The almonds with the tilapia and cheese were awesome. I cooked basically according to the recipe... but also seasoned the flour rather than the egg wash. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and peas. Also the lemon garnish at the end should be included it added that extra zest and accented all the flavors perfectly.",

However my husband thinks this tilapia is even better! I used packaged Italian Parmesan flavored almonds and a freshly grated three-cheese blend. I also substituted garlic salt for the garlic pepper since I have never seen the latter in my grocery store. The previous reviewer mentioned that the almond mixture didn't go far enough so I used 1-1/2 cups of almonds and 1-1/2 cups of cheese for five fillets. (I have no idea how much each one weighed.) It was barely enough! I had to end up increasing the flour too and I should have used three eggs because my last fillet was barely moistened. The end result was wonderful though.

I sprinkled the top w/ the remaining almond and Asiago mixture and a couple more pads of butter. I also squeezed a fresh lemon over the top and covered with tin foil.

I could also see using this breading recipe for orange roughy or other mild fish. I only had three filets and ended up using most of the egg mixture and much of the breading mixture as well. If serving this for a large group I would advise increasing the egg mixture and making sure you have extra almonds and cheese for the actual breading. Also while the butter definitely helps with the flavor I may try finding any alternative next time to cut the calories. (But boy was the buttery flavor good!)",
