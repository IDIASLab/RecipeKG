                "reviewBody": "I used my Kitchen Aid to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast (I used one whole \"packet\" of active yeast) in the mixer bowl with the honey and warm water for ten minutes until the yeast \"bloomed\", then I added the starter, molasses, egg, melted butter (which I used instead of margerine), then the dry ingredients. I did run my oats through my mini-processor before using it using the ice crushing feature so my oats would be a finer consistancy. This did need about 3/4 cup of flour more than what was asked for in the recipe. I kneaded this dough with my dough hook for about five minutes, then I set it to rise for an hour in a large greased bowl covered with a tea towel on a warm heating pad for an hour. I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to make uniform rolls and rolled them on the counter to make better shaped rolls. I covered the top of the rolls in a greased muffin tin with saran wrap before letting it rise on the warm heating pad for another half hour or so. I baked them at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. These rolls were really very good! The oats gave the rolls a nutty kind of flavor--which was just wonderful combined with the yeasty-sourness of the starter and the buttery-molasses-y flavor. These turned out really fluffy and soft and just......incredible! NOTE: I will say that I did not get 24 rolls out of this recipe, I got 12. That was fine for me because that was all I needed. For someone else who wants a recipe that make a larger quanitity, be sure to double this recipe.",

I followed the recipe pretty closely except for the additional flour needed which is very typical when making bread because of environmental differences. The second batch I used 1/4 butter (1/2 cup is just to much fat in a loaf of bread), and rolled oats that I soaked in the water, 1 cup wheat flour 2 cups white and again additional flour to reach the right consistency. These were light and fluffy with a soft crust. The kids devoured them. I agree it would be very hard to get 24 rolls from one batch but these are so yummy I'll need to double them every time!\n    A few hints when using sour dough; it must be  kneaded until the dough is soft not sticky and an imprint with your knuckle springs back slowly. There is a fantastic site to explain the nuances of working with sour dough http://www.thewilbournegroup.com/Sourdough/SourdoughStarterHelp.html , especially note the paragraph on shaping and baking. I've never had another misshapen flat loaf again.(well worth the read).\n  We made cinnamon rolls with a batch of these, also very yummy. Thanks for the great recipe!",
