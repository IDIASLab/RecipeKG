                "reviewBody": "I just got done making these. I made a few changes..First, since I have never pickled sausages or eggs I had read many recipes and got tips from each that I used in this recipe. First I did eggs and sausages together. I also used several meats to see what worked out best. Cheap hot dogs not beef, cause other reviews said all beef caused oil to float on surface. Second regular lil smokies, third sausage links. Then of course I boiled some eggs and pealed them and added to the jar.  As far as the brine I used the 4 cups of vinegar, but only 2 cups water. I increased the salt to 3 TBS, added 3 bay leaves, 1 tsp basil, black pepper, 10 whole peppercorns, 2 TBS red cayenne pepper, 1 tsp red pepper flakes, sea salt, 10 drops red food color, & 4 cloves of fresh garlic. I minced 2 cloves and cooked in the brine . The other 2 I crushed and added to the jar. Once I cooked the brine and added all the meats and eggs I poured the vinegar over everything and closed it up..After it sat for about 2 hours it was killing me and I had to taste something. I pulled out a hot dog and I have to tell you that in a couple days these will be great!! There gonna b a little spicy and have a good zing..That's what I wanted. I am trying to copy cat Tijuana mama's, Red Hots, etc. This recipe is gonna do that. I plan on staying out of them for at least a week :) before I dig in... ~~ Fingers Crossed~they make it that long.",

Just our preference.  Either way, thanks for the recipe.",

I omitted the red dye and substituted hot sauce because I prefer a less artificial look. I also recommend letting the pickling brine cool down for 45 mins or so. Boiling-hot liquid will draw out the fat from the sausages leading to some rather unappetizing-looking fat chunks in the final product. For my subsequent batch I let it cool down and avoided this.",

I had just taken delivery of a two pound package of Klement's beef sticks that I had ordered from a coworker's daughter who was doing a fundraiser. The sticks were perfectly sized to fit inside a quart jar without having to cut them down. I reduced the water by one cup added hot pepper flakes and a bit of habanero hot sauce and omitted the food coloring. I was able to pack 15 sausages in each jar covered them with the brine and put on new lids and rings. The results were excellent after only two days but I'm hoping the second jar will be even better after having more time to sit in the brine solution. One thing I would recommend is to store them in the refrigerator as soon as the jars are cool enough to handle.",
