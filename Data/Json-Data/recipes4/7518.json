I added about a teaspoon each of garlic salt and paprika to the flour mixture and some Montreal seasoning to the beef mixture.  I really like that I could make this part of the meal earlier in the day and then have time later to focus on the side dishes instead of doing it all at the same time. We will definitely make this again!",
