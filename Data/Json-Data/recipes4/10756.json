Boy, was I disappointed, even after taking the other reviews about reducing the water and lack of pizzazz into account. =(\r\n\r\nI think I would take the other recipe which calls for 2lbs sausage and only 1 1/2 cups of baking mix and modify it with italian seasonings and much less pizza sauce if I were making it again.\r\n\r\nSome things I did find useful and would help address the \"messiness issue\", I had to put the mixture in the fridge as I was interrupted in making them. I also used my small cookie ball scoop to get it out of the bowl and shape them onto the baking sheet. I put mine out on foil and they were rather difficult to remove once done.",
