I made this with a 4 lb chuck roast, doubled all the ingredients and added a LOT more garlic (that's my personal preference, but 2 cloves sounded way too light for this much meat!)The only other change I made was to add 2 packets of Goya sazon and some capers near the end.  This recipe is as good as ANYTHING you'll get in a cuban restaurant(even in Miami).  Served it with moros y christianos (black beans & white rice) for a really traditional cuban meal.  A good squeeze of lime on top is all it needs. do try this..you won't be disappointed!",

I made this ropa vieja for my boyfriend's 30th birthday and I got nothing but rave reviews for days to come! The only changes I made was I added an entire head of garlic (chopped) and 1/2 a 7oz jar of diced red pimientos in addition to all the other ingredients. I also took out some of the liquid approx 1 hour prior to finishing (on the 4 hours HIGH mode) shredded the meat then and added 2 tblspns of Brown Sugar then stirred. This really made the flavors come alive by the end of the 4 hours. Probably one of the best recipes I've ever made! Served over white rice black beans w/ salad. THank you so much!!",

I did however only give it a 4 because I did make some adjustments to make it come out more flavorful. \nFirst, I made sure to season and marinade the beef the night before. I seasoned the meat with a badia complete season (used often in hispanic dishes) and some badia chimmichuri sauce. I then sprinkled it with garlic salt and rubbed some more minced garlic as well. I then wrapped the beef in saran wrap to sit over night. In the morning I tossed the remaining ingridients as listed and went to work. It came out wonderfully seasoned and not at all bland like other reviews said. I will definetly make this again. \nThanks!",

As per the gourmet version, I added a lot more garlic (5 cloves but will probably use even more next time) and 1/4 cup of capers at the end, which added a nice salty/tangy flavor.  Next time I will try this with a can of drained tomatoes rather than the sauce because I think there was more than enough liquid with the beef stock. I think the nicest thing about this recipe is that it uses many fresh ingredients rather than canned or powdered soup, etc. that seems to be popular in crock-pot cooking. This might take a few more minutes to prepare than some other crock-pot recipes but it is definitely worth it!",

Took out 1.5 cups of beef water to use as broth. Next stir-fried the onions peppers garlic 3 minutes. Then added the other ingredients a bay leaf. Simmered it covered for 30 minutes.

Cook on low 6 hours for tenderness and use flank steak; skirt steak is ok but doesn't shread as easily) Mmmmmm",
