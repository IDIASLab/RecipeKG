Changed the method a bit, though because having to wash two stockpots would have made it that much less comforting. Cooked the onion, as directed, then added the potatoes and carrots to the onion, sauteed for about 5 minutes on medium low heat, added vegetable broth, brought to a boil, and then simmered, covered, for about 15 minutes, till potatoes were tender. Added herbs and pepper, and 2 cups of milk. Whisked flour with the other cup of milk, and added it to the simmering soup. Cooked till thickened. Served bowls of grated cheese and crumbled bacon (for the meat eaters in the family) on the side, and some lovely cheese toast. Felt much better afterward. Thanks so much.",

I mixed one Tablespoon of flour into soup at a time so as to reach the consistency of thickness I wanted because of using Pet evaporated milk as its thicker than milk.

The first time I made this I sauteed with olive oil rather than butter and I replaced water for whey leftover from making cheese (with non-fat powdered milk no less). It was hands-down the best potato soup I've ever had and not a soul would believe it didn't have butter (and lots of fat) in it. Even better the second time around. Realize here that you're making a roux - if you don't know about roux it's worth looking up so you understand how it works.",

Add in your potatoes and \nseason to your liking and you have a great soup!\nI have now made this many, many times with many variations.  I tried it the other day adding a can of veggie broth to the flour/oil mixture and a combo of almond and coconut milk.  REALLY good, will now be the variation I use most.
