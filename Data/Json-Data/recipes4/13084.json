I change the butter for 1 1/2 tbs dark sesame oil and 1 1/2 tbs spicy HOT sesame oil. The result was a FANTASTIC side dish for my pan seared Tuna, and jasmin rice with dry shiitake mooshrooms.

It was what I love best - the sweet and the sour - about having my greens with chow chow but all in one simple dish. I used pure maple syrup instead of honey because of taste preference; otherwise I made this just as it was written. Tip: salt the greens and let them weep out their bitterness for about 30 min - 1 hour before cooking. Just be sure to rinse off the salt and then give the them a good squeeze. This will also help you fit them into the pan without have to wilt them in batches.",
