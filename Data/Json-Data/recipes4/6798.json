I used fresh corn tortillas, which I quartered and layered the dish in three layers so mine came out more like a chicken enchilada casserole. The seasonings were spot on. I also substituted  a can of cream of poblano soup with the can of chicken soup. This is a great winter comfort food, but oh so easy any time you have leftover chicken. My leftover chicken was smoked, so it added an additional layer of flavor to the flavor profile. Thanks Sarah! Great recipe!",
