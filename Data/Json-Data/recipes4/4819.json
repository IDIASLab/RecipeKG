Making the spice mixture in bulk is a great idea. It saves a lot of time and we love Moroccan lamb burgers using this mixture too. I have also found this recipe to be very forgiving. I've omitted items, added stuff like kale and zucchini, tweaked the spices when I was out of one, and substituted dried cranberries, figs and raisins for the apricots in a pinch. I\u2019ve also used less broth to make it more hearty, and served it over rice and couscous. Enjoy!",

I added about 3 large garlic cloves, minced, subbed raisins for the apricots, and ran some fresh tomatoes through the food processor as I didn't have canned.  I forgot to add the butter, and rather than cut up carrots I dumped in half a bag of frozen carrots, peas, and corn.  I used my Instant Pot, and once the lamb, onions, garlic, and spices were saut\u00e9ed and everything else was in there too, I sealed the lid and set it for 15 minutes at high pressure, as we were hungry and didn't want to wait 30 minutes for the lentils to cook.  That 15 minutes was the right guess, as everything was completely cooked - but it was runnier, soupier, than we liked.  We served it over Jasmine rice.  I don't know what I'd do next time for more flavor and  a thicker stew - more lentils?  tomato paste?  mash one  of the sweet potatoes?  Not flour or cornstarch, I don't think..... but it for sure needed more body.",
