Cooked together in one pot and boy is it juicy! My mom is Irish and hated the traditional corned beef, potatoes, and cabbage version. She got the basis for this recipe from her Italian Mother in Law. Add a nice warm crusty roll, butter, and a pint of Guinness or Pinot Noir and you got yourself a hearty meal to celebrate the Irish!",

It's always sold in my stores here in NJ near the ham slices - but I can still get the one labeled 'butt' in the red cellophane!  Good luck!",

I removed it from the pot, added the cored and quartered cabbage, the potatoes, a bit of black pepper, and simmered that until the cabbage was soft and had released it's natural liquid.  Then I replaced the ham which I had cut into large chunks, heated everything up again and served with crusty rye bread.  Wonderful, hearty meal at any time of year.  It's even better the next day!
