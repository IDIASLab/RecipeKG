I used 2tsp of cornstarch in place of the flour and half the amount of scallions. I didn't have OJ concentrate so I subsituted 1/2 the water with regular orange juice. Made a wonderful sauce that was perfect atop white rice. I recommend adding the mandarins just prior to serving -- I cooked them too long and they disintegrated. No added salt is needed as the bullion cubes provide more than enough. This recipe would work really well with beef or shrimp as well. A definite keeper!",
