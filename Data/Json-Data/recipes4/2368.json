I pounded out the chicken breasts and put them on the grill pan (way too hot in TX to cook outside!).  I cut them to fit the buns before putting the jack cheese on.  I also used turkey bacon, which was fine, but I'm sure regular bacon would have been even better!  Just a little mayo with the red onion and it was great.",

We left the pickles on the side along with some kettle cooked chips. Not bad for a quick meal!",
