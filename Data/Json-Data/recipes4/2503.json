I changed a couple things: used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and canned beans not draining them. Also I excluded the cheese altogether and then when served added sour cream a few fresh tomatoes and avocado. Voila! Yummy. My hubby is SO not a vegetarian and so I put cooked sausage in it for him and he loved it:)",

But when you have to cook beans for nearly 22 hours there is something totally wrong with the way a recipe is written. And to start this recipe by extra 12 hours ahead too because of a bean soak. You shouldn't have to go to so much trouble. I started this a bean soak on a Monday night before going to bed about 8. Following morning put everything together about 9am by 11:30am smelling good but beans are crunchy. 2pm same deal by 4pm still flustered...by 6pm adding a 28 crushed tomatoes(only to see that the can is mismarked and it's actually tomato sauce) by 8pm adding 2 cups of water and then at 11:30pm adding another 2 cups of water and beans are partly crunchy with some stightly soft on others. I was at the point of not wanting to get up every couple of hours to check on the status I went to bed. By 7:30am now Wed morning. The batch looks like mushed chili still smells good tastes ok beans are firm but soft....the over all batch isn't that appealing and if I decided to add rice and cheddar it's going to look like glop. I'm not overally pleased with the outcome because of the shear frustration of the amount of time to get this recipe complete. I went back and looked and talked to others over my frustration and this recipe needs more water to do as the author states. I won't be making this again. I'm sorry.",

I also (for my husband mainly and to use up some freezer items) added some chorizo sausage and let it cook in the crock pot with the other ingredients...on low for 6 hours. This could be a very versatile recipe adding other vegetables or beans. We ate it with corn bread and it was SO yummy!!",
