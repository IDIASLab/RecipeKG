Discovered I was out of oregano so used Italian seasoning in its place and omitted the thyme as it is in the Italian seasoning. Added a little chopped onion and minced garlic. Left the cheese amounts the same. It took almost all the mixture to fill the 9\" deep pie crust so doubling is definitely necessary. Made a mini crustless quiche with the leftover. The quiche was good but not what you would say mmmm this is really good. Unless I see some new reviews with good suggestions on improving the taste I probably would not make this again.",

Also- I didn't prick the crust nor oil it.  I used pie weights when I baked the crust and I sprayed the quiche pan with Pam beforehand.\nI also cut 4 grape tomatoes and removed the seeds and interior.  (This was primarily done for color and decoration)\nAll else was as written in the original recipe.  It was FANTASTIC!  Thanks JJ's mom!!!!",

I prepared in a regular size pie pan rather than a deep dish. I would not have had enough filling for a deep dish. I also used fresh oregano in place of the dried pepper jack in place of the Cheddar and only used tsp. of thyme. It did take longer than 40 minutes to bake. Mine took about 50 minutes. This baked up and set up nicely. The quiche cut and served great too. All in all this is a good quiche and I will make it again next time I think I will add some diced onions and fresh tomatoes to the broccoli mixture.",
