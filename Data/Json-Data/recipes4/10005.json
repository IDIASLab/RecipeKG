I would suggest adding the spices a little at a time tasting the broth after each addition until you have it as hot as you want it. Another note: I bought bone-in chicken thighs and boiled them ahead of time with some Old Bay Seasoning. When I discovered how hot the stuff was going to be I added some of the leftover broth to the mixture to cool it down. When we were eating I realized that I could taste a strong chickeny/Old Bay flavor from the broth and I just don't think that the recipe would've been as good without it. So next time I'll probably just use cups of broth instead of water to make it a heartier dish. Thanks for the recipe!",

I did change a few things: 1) I didn't use any oil and just mixed the flour with some water as I thought the chicken thighs and sausage had enough fat already 2)I didn't have cajun seasoning so I used creole seasoning 3) I added more cayenne because it really wasn't very spicey for our tastes 4) After frying the meat I threw everything into a crock pot on low for 3 to 4 hrs or high for 1 to 2 hrs 5) I always substitute celery salt for celery. With my minor changes it was excellent and has gone into our regular rotation of meals:)",

A couple of the ingredients are different, such as the sausage, we always added bell pepper (equal amount to the onion).
