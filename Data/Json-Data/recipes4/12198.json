With 3/4 cup of butter (that's a stick and a half of butter) and 6 cups of water, I basically ended up with butter soup.  The recipe only calls for a couple of tablespoons of tomato sauce.  Within 6 cups of water, that doesn't do anything.  Maybe its supposed to be tomato paste?  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I basically ended up with melted butter floating on top of slightly tinted water.  I ended up having to throw the whole thing out.  It was very disappointing because all the shrimp (I didn't have crawfish) was wasted.  Maybe I did something wrong, if so please tell me!  I was so excited when I read the other reviews.  Mine just didn't turn out anything like it.",
