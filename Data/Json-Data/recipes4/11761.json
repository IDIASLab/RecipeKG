My recipe is the only version I know of that is southwest style, in fact, this is fusion cuisine, because this is not an authentic southwest recipe.  Mole adds a wonderful richness to this dish. You might want to make a pan of cornbread, it's great with this.  Serve with red wine, and a salad of jicama, cabbage, and celery.",

It was kind of daunting I was afraid to cook it until I found this recipe. All I can say is WOW! This is so good that I might buy another heart just to make it again. I did not tell my family what cut of beef was in this dish when I served it in order to avoid the drama of thier reaction and everyone ate seconds on it. It will be my little secret. Now I just need to figure out what to do with the tongue and oxtails!!",
