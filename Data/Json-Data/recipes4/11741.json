I intend to make a batch each weekend and store it in the fridge to save on calories (and money) for Chai from the coffee shop!  Comparatively, this recipe is pretty low calorie.  90 cal per serving compared to 240 cal for a grande Chai latte at Starbucks.  My first batch had a good balance of spices, but was just a little sweet for my family's liking.  I think next time I make it, I'll use 3/4 of the sweetened condensed milk rather than the whole can.",
