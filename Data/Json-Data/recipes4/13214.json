I had to interrupt the cooking time because I didn't start until Saturday morning. It didn't hurt a thing in fact it probably helped me manage it because refrigerating it after removing bones and straining allowed the fat to congeal for easy removal. Also bonus: my strainer did not get the finer particles out which I discovered after refrigeration. They settled to the bottom and I was able to remove before the final reduction. Beautiful healthy beef stock with a surprisingly good color. I think next time I will roast the bones prior to simmering for an even deeper color and flavor. Thanks for your clear instructions!",
