This recipe was both. I followed the directions to the tee - the only exception was that I used frozen spinach instead of fresh - and it turned out fantastic! This is definitely one we will make again. The only slight thing I would change is that for inexperienced cooks like myself I was a little confused on the pie crust. Was I suppose to follow the directions for the pie crust on the package THEN follow the one in the recipe? I ended up ignoring the package instructions and just followed the recipe and it turned out fine. Thanks again for posting this! We were getting sick of bean tacos and spaghetti!",

My oven is not level so I turned the pie plate 1/4 turn after 15 minutes and again after another 15 to keep the quiche even. It was done in 50 minutes & smelled wonderful. I let it sit 5 minutes before serving. It received good comments from everyone but my son found it to be bland. I gave him the hot sauce bottle (?!) and he was happy. There were NO leftovers.",
