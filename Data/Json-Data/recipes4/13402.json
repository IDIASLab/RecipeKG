Next time I think I'll do half and half because the red lentils added a nice texture and the brown lentils were a little overwhelming.\n\nI reduced the amount of water used in the second step, instead used enough to follow the package directions for the rice and TVP, and it worked out well.  I was paranoid the rice wouldn't cook fully without heat so I simmered everything for 10 minutes and then let it sit covered for another 10 minutes.  The rice cooked completely and there was no excess water.\n\nI took others' suggestions and added a splash of red wine vinegar at the end.  It really did help brighten the flavor.  I think I will add more curry powder next time.",

Next time i make it I plan on partially cooking the rice in the 2.5C of water and then adding it to the pot. i also simmered it covered for 10 minutes and uncovered for 15 minutes instead of letting it sit. Overall a very flavorful dish and i will be making it again",

Using  Raghavan\u2019s Curry Blend (on AR), which already contains cumin, I added 1 whole TBSP of curry. I served it with a yogurt raita and fresh coriander. Absolutely delicious.
