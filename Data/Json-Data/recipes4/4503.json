I did make a couple of changes though: I used about 1.25lb gound turkey and 1.3lb of mexican chorizo sausage (I didn't want all that fat in there). I also added more cumin some paprika and chili podwer. Instead of ricotta I used cottage cheese (since that's what I do with my regular Italian lasagna). In addition to the cobly jack I used I added pepper jack to the ricottta/egg mixture. And for an additional crunch I added a can of corn to the sauce. This had kick and turned out AWESOME. I can't wait to make it again (since after eating 2 pieces I dropped the entire lasagna pan). Thank!",
