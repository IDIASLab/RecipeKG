It looked kind of sad on the table next to the sugar & butter laden Easter cake but people did actually eat some. It has a strong resemblance (appearance-wise) to oatmeal. I love sweet but I thought the 1/3 c. of Splenda for baking was a bit too much- as the recipe says though to taste. I left the leftovers with a diabetic family member. I wanted to like this more but alas I will stick with my sugary junk.",
