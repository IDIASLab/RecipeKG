So I basted them with olive oil and baked them for 5 minutes at 475 degrees. They wre crispy and delicious. I made two of them with diced Anaheim chili peppers and those were theeee best ever!!!! The chili pepper has a great flavor and are not hot at all. You could probably get the same crunch from diced celery but the Anaheim chilis are packed with flavor. I'll definitely be making some more of these very soon. Oh, and the sweet chili sauce I used is from Trader Joe's. This sauce is essential for dipping. The sweetness of the dipping sauce mixes beautifully with the cream cheese and jalapenos.  ",

                "reviewBody": "I started with JanNoel's advice and used one finely chopped Anaheim pepper (they're big!) and baked them at 475 for 5 minutes. To the mix I add 2/3 cup parmesan (the cheap stuff) 3/4 tsp garlic salt a couple shots of hot sauce and 2/3 cup mozzarella. After folding them into triangles I lightly coat them on both sides with cooking spray and bake them on a cookie sheet covered in foil. Easy cleanup! After pulling them out I flip them and let them cool for 3-4 minutes. I dip them in ranch dressing and they're so good! If you like it spicy and the Anaheim pepper you get is not so spicy you can add a chopped jalapeno. Without these changes this recipe is bland but with them it's absolutely wonderful! A great base recipe! Foolproof and can be changed to tastes. Update: When I don't have an anaheim pepper I use a 1/2 jalapeno chopped (with seeds to make it hot). If you're spice shy chop up one jalapeno without the seeds.",
