I did make a couple of changes per other reviewers' suggestions and my family's own tastes (the changes I made include using 3 teaspoons of Italian seasoning instead of 2, adding 1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper, adding an extra clove of garlic, using 3 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese instead of 2, and using 2 eggs instead of just 1 egg).  I also served these on Hoagie rolls and topped them with shredded Mozzarella cheese.  The only other additional comment I wanted to make was that I ended up with 24 meatballs instead of 12 (I thought making only 12 meatballs made the meatballs a little too big for our tastes).  Thank you so much for a great meal idea!",

The flavor was amazing; this is going in my personal cookbook.  I made my own ground beef using my KitchenAid.  I decided to add onion.  I incorporated the onion and parsley with the beef as I ground it.  I increased the Italian seasonings to 1 T, the parmesan to 1/4 cup, and used 2 eggs.  I also added 2 tsp salt and 2 tsp fresh ground pepper.  I also added 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella.  Used the KitchenAid to do the mixing for a few minutes - then formed the meatballs using a cookie scoop (evenly measures one tablespoon size servings).  I ended up with 30 meatballs.  TIP:  Keep your hands wet as you form the meatballs - helps keep the meat from sticking to your hands the the meatballs form faster.  Of course if you have a cookie scoop, this will greatly speed up the process.  Be sure to bake the meatballs for at least 30 minutes to ensure they are properly cooked through.",

I also toasted some hoagie rolls to make individual servings and used mozzarella.  Delicious!\n\nEDIT: After making this a few more times I'd like to add some advice.  Use the leanest hamburger you can find.  Even 85/15 will produce too much grease.  Bake over a broiler pan to get rid of the grease.  Adding one or two links of fresh, spicy sausage is delicious.  Just slice open the casings and add the meat.  Use the cheap bread crumbs.  I've tried this recipe with fresh, storebought, and panko (Japanese bread crumbs) and it tastes best with the cheap, 'Italian' breadcrumbs.",

I had the meatballs in the oven for 45 minutes which they were still a tad pink. Next time I will put them in there longer because I like my hamburger well-done.
