I was worried about it being a little too sweet but it turned out pretty amazing.\nI made it for an early Valentine's Day dinner and it was a great choice for the occasion. \nI didn't cube the meat because I wanted the cuts whole, so I seared the tenderloins an cooked them in the oven at 500 degrees for 4 minutes and let them sit on the pan will a foil tent for a few minutes before placing them in the skillet with the reduction sauce at a medium low heat for 4 more minutes on each side which got them to a perfect medium-rare.\nThe sauce did reduce a bit faster than 30 minutes so this is definitely a recipe you have to watch closely.\nLittle bit of modifications but it was a big hit for me and my husband.",
