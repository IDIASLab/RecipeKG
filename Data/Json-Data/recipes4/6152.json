This is what I changed (my daughter is pescetarian): 14 oz. Tofurkey Italian Sausage instead of hot dogs; 1 lbs. raw peeled shrimp instead of vegetarian fried chicken; 1.5 cups wild rice blend instead of 1 cup brown rice; ground thyme instead of dried. Also, the recipe calls for 2 tsp. cajun seasoning; I used 1 tsp of Tony Chacere's Cajun Seasoning, which has a lot of salt, and 1 tsp of creole spices with no salt added, which gives it a little more kick. Also, the first time I used dry rice, which did not cook thoroughly on the top layer, so the second time, I partially cooked the rice first.",

I did make it exactly as written except for all the chicken flavored vegetarian meat.  I've been vegetarian for years and don't need meat substitutes that taste like chicken.  I used beans instead.  other than that, I made it exactly as written.  I'm not at all afraid of heat in a recipe and I was kind of excited to see 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  However, it's so hot that I can't taste any of the other spices.  The next time I make it, I'll either eliminate the cayenne entirely or add something like 1/4 teaspoon, just to see if I can bring out the cajun seasoning flavor.  As mentioned above, I used beans for the protein and also a couple of vegetarian hamburger patties.  Since we're so far off-road for traditional jambalaya, I won't hesitate to add more vegetables.....maybe some corn, broccoli, zucchini, or anything else.  For me, it's a good starter recipe that will have to be adjusted to my palette.  I also think that the rice was a little bit chewy.  I was concerned about the ratio of rice to liquid.  I'll add a little more broth next time.",
