I did not cook before adding to crock....I added it raw with everything else. I also only used 2 cans of small white beans....thought 5 cans of beans to 2 lbs of chicken seemed off. So I upped the chicken and reduced the amount of beans and this ratio of 4 lbs of chicken to 2 cans of beans seemed better. I used frozen corn, 1/2 a bag. Added a chopped vidalia onion instead of dried minced, added a yellow squash diced to add more veg factor to the dish and also added a can of rotel. Served with white cheddar cheese and sour cream. Very easy and yummy crockpot recipe. Thanks!",

Leftovers.AWESOME.\" My daughter (young, and starting to get the same weekly-chili-urges that I do) made a big fuss when she saw this. Really irate meltdown b/c it didn't look like traditional chili. I let her sit there squeaking, turned away to do the dishes (as I'd already inhaled my bowl), and to my glee, hear her shoveling away b/t \"mmm\" noises, as she realized after a nibble that this chili was fantastic. To make this even easier, please no tsk-tsk, I used 2 large cans of chicken from Costco (it's really good stuff, and I know alot of AR folks are snobbish about canned chicken), and also used 1/2 chopped yellow pepper, and 1/2 chopped onion, instead of dried. As faithful as I could be to this recipe, I have to say that I loved it (even better the 2nd day) and look forward to making it again.\n9/10/15: THREE YEARS LATER and my new LO is loving this chili too! I am still using Costco canned chicken and adding in sauteed onions. Freezes beautifully as well.",

I halved the amount of chilies in case it was too hot and added a fresh onion and some garlic. I also added about 1/2 cup of herdez green salsa to the cooker. I didn't see the point of cooking the chicken before hand when it's just going to cook in the slow cooker so I just threw it in. The 1/2 batch easily fit into my 3.5 quart slow cooker. I cooked it on \"simmer\" (one setting below \"low\") for 8 hours. The end result was delicious with a bit of heat. I topped it with sour cream and had some garlic bread with it. I would probably decrease the amount of chicken broth next time (probably to only about 1/2 a cup) because it ended up being a bit watery or more soupy. Otherwise this is great! Nice change from traditional \"red\" chilies!",
