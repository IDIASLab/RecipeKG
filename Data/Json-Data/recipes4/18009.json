I had already soaked my beans overnight and even though I doubled the recipe I still used my pressure cooker for 15 minutes. The beans were cooked just right not overcooked-meaning they were soft enough to eat but intact and held up to the saut\u00e9ing at the end. I drained the liquid before adding the oil and garlic but reserved it for future recipes. I ended up freezing the leftovers as these would be good as a side on their own or even as an addition to other recipes. Thank you for sharing this with us.",

I like pinto beans personally, but this is exactly the way I make my beans. I don't b other soaking them, I just cook them for an hour in the panela de pressao and tudo esta maravilhosa! Nothing better than rice and beans as a side dish. Pennies in your pocket will keep you well fed.",
