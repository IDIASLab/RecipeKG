I did brown the ground meat with some onions first and added lipton onion soup mix after. White uncooked regular rice worked fine. I added 1 can of tomato soup and 1/2 cup water and poured over top of the layers without stirring. Came out great! The only thing I'd change for next time is add some sourkraut on top and use one more can of soup for more sauce. YUMMY!",

In the crock pot I put the meat mixture 1 can Itailian style tomatoes 1 large can of Hunt's low sugar spag. sauce 1 roasted red bell pepper and the cabbage cut into large strips. I turned it on high for 2 hours around 1 pm. By the time I got back the cabbage was done so I just kept it on warm until 30 minutes before dinner. I cooked 3/4 cup of buckwheat groats w/ and egg white and 1 1/2 cups of water and added it to the beef and cabbage. My husband was so surprised when he came home! My daughter who is not a fan of cabbage has eaten this for lunch & dinner for the last 2 days and is having the last bit for lunch today as well. It is hard not to over cook the cabbage that is why I kept an eye on it otherwise it would have turned to mush. I don't know about not cooking the meat first either...I think the recipe would turn out way too greasy.",

I modified this based on my mom's recipe and others suggestions. Used Meatloaf mix instead of beef for more flavor added cooked bacon (the missing key flavor if you ask me!) cut cabbage in thick slices verses shredded and used two cans of tomato soup and one can of water instead of tomato sauce. Cooked on High for 4-5 hours and my uncooked long grain rice turned out fine. The key is to make sure you have enough liquid to cook the rice. We can now have the taste of Globki's more than 3x a year!! Note: This does come out quite mushy so texture wise you don't get the browned cabbage like when rolled and baked but flavor is great.",
