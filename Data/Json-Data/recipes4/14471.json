I put the cauliflower in a bowl with garlic cloves, sprayed it and added salt, pepper and some curry powder before roasting.  Then instead of frying onions in oil, I boiled onions, celery and a carrot in vegetable broth.  After that was mainly cooked, I added the roasted cauliflower to the broth for about 10 more minutes to make sure that it was well cooked for blending.  \r\n\r\nAdded a wee bit of cheddar to each bowl when serving. Yummy.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't hurt to boil veggies in water, if you are going to eat the water too!!",

I also added some curry powder and celery salt. Instead of using chicken stock I used the water and added chicken granules for the basic same effect. I also added some fried tofu garnishes as well.

Another reviewer mentioned adding curry and that might have just been the ticket to a tastier soup. I love roasted cauliflower and thought that roasting the cauliflower would bring out a tantalizing nutty flavor. I did not use olive oil cooking spray but sprayed the cauliflower with pure olive oil before roasting. Being of the more is better school of thought when it comes to garlic I used more than four cloves. I roasted them whole with the cauliflower and perhaps saut\u00e9ing them with the onion as the recipe directed instead of roasting would have boosted the flavor. The soup was best the day after it was made and gets an extra star for being healthy!",
