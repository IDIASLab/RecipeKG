This is no wimpy chili either because it has hunks of beef in a spicy yet extraordinarily flavorful sauce. We froze the extras & when thawed we heated added some fresh shredded cheese & sour cream & it was still great. We will definitely make this again! By the way take the submitters advice & make the delicious cornbread that was mentioned the two recipes make for a great meal.",

Are those sirens I hear?...Yep...this is definitely 5 alarm chili. Yikes my burning mouth! LOL. It was good but not kid friendly. To save my kids I had to add the following to tone down the heat: 1 can tomato sauce and 1/4 cup of sugar. I also felt the chili needed salt so I added a few teaspoons of the kosher variety. I served with shredded cheddar cilantro sour cream and corn bread. Much better. Oh and have an ice cold glass of milk at the ready to extinguish further \"fires\". Thanks for sharing the recipe.
