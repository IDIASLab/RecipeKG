I sliced it about 1/8\" thick in hopes of making crackers but they were just too hard. On the bright side my dogs go gaga over the 'crackers' for treats so it wasn't a total waste of sublime ingredients:) I am very health conscious when it comes to my pooches as well so I do feel good about giving this to them. However I don't think I would make it again just for them due to the expense of the ingredients.",
