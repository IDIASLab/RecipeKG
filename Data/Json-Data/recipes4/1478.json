Instead of oiling the grate I cut a piece of foil paper and matched it in size to a cookie sheet spread out my asparagus and then brushed liberally with the marinade.

My way also involved a pound of asparagus to the stated amount of marinade plus garlic and onion powders. I tossed the asparagus twice and basted liberally both times.",
