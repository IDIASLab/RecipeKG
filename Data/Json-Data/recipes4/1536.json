I had about four large celery ribs that needed to be used, so I just chopped it up along with the carrots and threw them in the bacon fat with the potatoes. (I had to add just a little more previously reserved bacon fat to the pan, only because there was more veg. I know I'm not the only one who saves bacon fat in the fridge!) I followed the recipe exact. I'm the only one who loves clam chowder in this house, which is fine with me. I'm NOT SHARING. I ate two bowls with homemade ranch oyster crackers. I feel better already! NOTE: Next time, I'll be sure to cook the potatoes with the clam juice. Good tip.",

Second, it's MUCH less expensive than buying the *gasp!* canned stuff.  And third, EVEN I LIKED IT!!  I should mention that I really don't like clam chowder at all, but of course the only stuff I've ever tasted was the canned stuff *gasp again!*  My kids love clam chowder and fight each other for it if there's not enough to share, so I made this for them.  As recommended, I used two bottles of clam juice instead of water to boil the potatoes and carrots in.  I had promised the recipe's author on the Recipe Exchange that I would at least TASTE the soup and boy am I glad I did!!  The kids almost had to fight ME for this.  We'll definitely be having this soup again many, many times.  Thanks for making me a clam chowder lover, Cindy!!",

Make it again.\"  How's THAT for a compliment?  I stuck pretty closely to the recipe, but I did substitute celery for the carrots (icky-I don't like them), and added some finely chopped onion.  I also covered the potatoes with bottled clam juice (one 8-0z bottle for a half recipe)  rather than water, which I think contributed significantly to its full flavor.  I did find then, that I didn't need quite the full amount of half-and-half to achieve the right level of thickness.  I didn't add salt to the soup, thinking there might just be enough in the leek soup mix, which proved to be the case.  This is rich, full-flavored and satisfying in every way. We cleaned up every drop.",

I used chicken broth in place of water to cover my potatoes, may try using extra clam juice next time. I also added in an onion with the potato and carrot, just because I had one and I felt like it should be in there . I did only use one package of the leek soup mix merely because I am a dork and only grabbed one at the store. I think one did the soup just fine though : )  Served it up in some sourdough breadbowls (wish I could have made those too!) and it was to die for!

I made it in the morning planning on reheating it for dinner in a double boiler but it was so flavoursome I ended up eating a bowl for breakfast. Served with oyster crackers one night and Cheddar Bay Biscuits the next night. Will with out a doubt be making this all winter long. Awesome recipe Cindy thank you",
