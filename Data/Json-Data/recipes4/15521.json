They were absolutely delicious and disappeared way to quickly! They were easy to make but the hard part is getting them started early enough to cook for 12 hours! We began sampling them about 1/2 hour ahead of time. They were practically gone when the 12 hour timer went off. There were 16 adults here and we fought over the last few! Next time I'll use 2 crockpots and double the recipe.  Everyone asked for the recipe and I will definitely be making these again and again and again! Thank you Melinda!",

I almost think you could knock about 3 hours off the cooking time and I sort of wish that more of the bite from the wine came through, so when I make them again, I may add it in later or add more at time closer to serving.  It smelled so good in the first few hours and by the time the 12 hours was over, it was gone.  I did not think they were too salty as some other reviewers mentioned...I wondered if some may have used \"garlic salt\" instead of the \"garlic powder\" the recipe called for.  I would make it again, but might alter it just a bit next time for more flavor.  Thanks for sharing!",

You can actually work while cooking or as I do, you can sleep while cooking this. I will be putting this on around 10:00 in the evening and will wake up to great aroma and maybe even BREAKFAST if it smells great. By the way, in doing it overnight, unless the heavenly smell wakes you up, you are not noshing all day. When you wake up they'll all be there for your meal with plenty for guests!",

The only thing I would change is to use less butter, as 1/2 a cup ended up being too much and made them a bit greasy for my taste, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Next time I will use 1/4 cup and see how that goes.  Also, mine were done in the crock pot after about 7 hours on low rather than 12.  Cooking it for 12 hours would have been way overkill in my crock pot, so I would advise checking the texture after about 6 hours or so.  A delicious recipe that I would recommend and will very likely make again.",
