                "reviewBody": "I'm an American that lives in northern Italy and there are many restaurants around my town that serve a vegetable soup that it very similar to this one. Because I love the taste so much I decided to make it for myself at home. This dish is not intended to be thick in texture or be \"full\" of flavor. At least not like we American enjoy (which is usually packed with fat). It is a brothy soup and its heartiness and taste comes from the vegetables inside. I did change the recipe up a bit to match what I have seen/had here. For flavor I added a table spoon of olive oil garlic salt instead of plain salt (but not too much) pepper a few dashes of oregano and 2 bouillon cubes (if you are a vegetarian you would leave these out). For the vegetables I threw in; small/medium red potato s celery stocks zucchini carrots tomato s and a half of an onion (all fresh and chopped) I didn t add bell peppers or cauliflower (mainly because I don t like the taste). I put all ingredients into a pot and brought it to a boil then I reduced the heat and let it slow cook until done. Almost immediately I could smell all the wonderful flavors coming out of this dish. Now as far as people having a problem that it was stated fat- and cholesterol-free and only 5% fat/calories to me this is really irrelevant. The soup IS a low fat and much healthier dish then some of the other vegetable soups I ve viewed on this site! So over all I think this recipe is a good start for creating your own healthy",

Saute the onions celery carrots and garlic in a teensy bit of EVOO with some red pepper flakes as your first step. It only adds minor fat and good fat at that. Just a little I promise. 3. Flat leaf parsley. Throw in a few handfuls coarsely chopped with the cauliflower. 4. The curry powder. How could curry powder possibly be 'optional'??? Curry powder is the 'IT' ingredient in this soup! Get it in there... and plenty of it. Two HEAPED teaspoons at minimum. 5. USE GOOD STOCK not water and those gross little MSG nuggets of bouillon. Eww. 6. Salt pepper salt pepper. Taste and season often throughout the process. 7. CHEESE RINDS. Take the rinds off your good hard cheeses like Parmesan Romano etc put them in a ziploc and throw them in the freezer. Any time you're making soup toss the rinds in early on. They add the depth that soup can lack especially a meatless soup. Again not to much fat truck loads of flavor.",

Granted I was missing a couple of ingredients (potatoes and celery) but there is such a tremendous amount of water called for in comparison to the amount of veggies/spices! I ended up adding white beans to mine as well as some quinoa which helped thicken it a little and give it a better texture. I also added about 10 bullion cubes (I didn't have powdered chicken bullion). I also added an extra teaspoon of curry powder skipped the dill as it didn't seem to fit with the other ingredients and added some cayenne pepper and dried parsley. After making these changes the soup is really pretty good and I would probably make it again. Thanks for sharing!",
