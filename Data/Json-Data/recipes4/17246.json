Way to make me look like a rockstar in the privacy of my own home (which is all that really matters to me).  \n\nThe only thing I did differently was BBQ/grill the chicken breasts before tossing them into the soup.  \nTo be perfectly honest?  My thinking was, if this doesn't pan out at least the chicken will be on point.  Well we loved it, all.\n\nI have THE world's pickiest (and most honest) hubby and he was raving.  \n\nThe lime and Sriracha ending are everything, don't leave them out.  Same with cilantro.

Also I had some leftover cold rice so that went into the bowls first with the soup poured over instead of using the maifun this time. Definitely a keeper recipe and so glad to have found it here!
