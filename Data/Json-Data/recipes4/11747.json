Look in your fridge or pantry for what you think could enhance the flavor of leftover rice. If you are looking to cook a different fried rice, Chinese style, here's one. If rice is cooked slightly dry or 1 day old, the output will turn out better.",

I mixed 2 eggs added to a flat skillet and heated up until it set flipped it over then set aside to cool. Once cooled I rolled up the egg omelet into a a burrito like shape and thinly sliced it set aside for later as a garnish. I had about 1 cup of leftover white rice chilled in the refrigerator and some leftover rotisserie chicken that I chopped up in place of ground chicken. I used 3 links of lup cheong chinese sausages sliced. I omitted the shiitake mushrooms. In a pot I used a teeny smidgen of veg oil heated up added some chopped garlic lup cheong stirred. There is enough oil from the lup cheong plus a little of the veg oil to make almost 2T of oil called for in this recipe. I added some frozen peas and carrots stirred to combine. Next I added the chopped up chicken. Once everything was heated I added the cold rice and broke it up while in the pot. I added a little soy sauce a dash of Lee Kum Kee oyster sauce and mixed well. I added little black pepper and salt to taste then sprinkled some chopped green onions as a garnish along with the thinly sliced eggs. I must say that is a meal in itself and makes quite a lot for two people plus leftovers for the next morning or for lunch. I am sure you can add other ingredients but this is usually how I make lup cheong fried rice. A tasty fulfilling dish!",

Should'a trusted the little voice in my head screaming \"DON'T DO IT!\" because I ended up with a mushy porridge NOT fried rice. I used day old rice and subbed cubed leftover pork loin for the Chinese sausage insignificant changes that could not have affected the outcome so I have to conclude that the recipe author (and other reviewers) like mushy fried rice.
