Broil it (10 minutes for the first side and 10-15 minutes for the second side) then put it in the glaze for a minute or so to soak in the taste. To lessen the sweetness, try apple sauce and a dash of lemon or a dryer wine. I think it was the wine that made it over the top sweet. It's yummy as it is but it would be fantastic with just a few minor adjustments.",

I cubed the pork first fried it for a few minutes removed from heat and reduced the sauce for a few minutes (added about a tbs flour to thicken) then added back the pork for a few more minutes.
