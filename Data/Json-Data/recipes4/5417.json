I finally figured out how to freeze the un-cooked biscuits so now I always have them on hand, but only have to make them once a week.  FYI if you're interested... make the recipe as is, except don't brush them with the butter milk.  Instead put all the un-cook biscuits on a cookie sheet with parchment paper on the tray.  Cover well with plastic wrap and put in the freezer.  Once frozen solid, put into a zip bag and leave in the freezer.  When you want to eat them you can have as many or as few as you need\n\n Pre-heat the oven to 475F and put frozen biscuits on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet; brush with buttermilk.  Put in the oven for 7 minutes, then without opening the oven turn the oven off and leave the biscuits in for 5 more or until lightly browned (don't open the door during this phase until the 5 min. are up).  add 1 min at a time until lightly browned.  Remove and enjoy!",

You are not in danger of over working the dough, as that is what makes a dense biscuit, by using the fold and press method. I have made these several times and the taste is wonderful. They bake up light and fluffy.  Two important tips that I have learned in making the perfect biscuit. \n1) use an up and down motion with your biscuit cutter or glass(whichever you use to cut your biscuits). Using a twisting motion causes the edges to seal and you will not get a good rise. \n2) when placing the cut biscuit dough on your baking sheet, place them so they touch one another. This also helps reach a wonderful rise as they bake. \nI have deemed this the definitive biscuit recipe and my search has ended here. As a matter of fact, I'm making these in the morning since the kids, yet again, have another snow day. \nAnd as always... Enjoy!",

I sometimes, after cutting in the butter, put it back in the fridge for about 30 mins. because the colder the better.  Other than that they are perfect.........you can also add a few teaspoons of sugar and then you have a dessert biscuit.     Substituting soured milk is not as good so worth investing in real buttermilk.  Thanks for printing this and highly recommend.  I am an award winning baker.",
