I added craisins instead of raisins and also some cayenne and jalapenos because we are spice-lovers here. I also used a meat thermometer because I was slightly worried about cooking the pork fully but the recipe's time was right in line with what the meat thermometer read. CAMEAL you rock!

We made the pork tenderloin as close to the recipe as we could get it to be. The only difference is we added prunes instead of raisins and pecans instead of pine nuts since we didn't have any of both at home. We also did what another reviewer did and substituted the garam masala with nutmeg. And we smeared a little bit of apple butter on the outside of the pork tenderloin after we wrapped it. We tried the quinoa stuffing mix before adding it to the pork tenderloin and felt it needed some salt so we added a little into it as well. Overall the pork tenderloin came out wonderful and moist. We will definitely be using this recipe again!",
