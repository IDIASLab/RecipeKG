I had my doubts as I was adding in the cinnamon and peaches, but this was oh, so yummy!  Even my 80 yr old dad who is pretty much a meat-and-potatoes guy asked for seconds and complimented the meal.  I used 5 leg quarters--the meat fell off the bone, so I fished out the bones (or at least most of them) before serving and just added the cornstarch/water mixture without removing the chicken.  I also omitted the apricots--only because I did not have any on hand.  I used frozen peaches--worked just fine, and I likely used more garlic than called for.  This one will definitely be repeated often in our household.  BTW, I put the chicken--frozen--in the crockpot the night before, left it in the fridge, and mixed up all the other ingredients so all I had to do before going to work was dump it in.  Cooked all day on low.  Served with brown rice.",

I had 4 large bone in breasts that needed to be used rather than the boneless and this actually worked out better because the amount of cooking time would have turned the boneless into shoe leather in my crockpot. This cooked for 7 hours on low and was on the warm feature for about 1 1/2 hours til I got home from work. I didn't have the apricots on hand so I did sub in carrots this time around. That was nice and next time I may add them along with the apricots. I did use everything else and it cooked down to a very nice sauce. Not to sweet and lots of interesting spices to give it lots of depth. Topped it with cilantro and sliced almonds. Served with couscous and pita and it turned out to be a wonderful comfort style meal without the hassle of standing over the stove. Not really sure what some of the other reviewers meant by \"blandness\". It was far from bland. Thanks Juliebo. I will make again for sure.",

(about 2 lbs of meat). (This may solve the problem of bland meat). I also used a large can of garbanzo beans. I couldn't find peaches in season at the grocery so I used a 28 oz can of sliced peaches and drained off the juice. I added heaping portions of all the spices since I was putting in extra meat etc. So this ended up not fitting in my small slow cooker- I cooked it on the stove in a large cast dutch oven. Simmered it a couple hours on the stove then pulled the meat from the bone and added the cornstarch water. Yum yum yum! So amazing over couscous!",
