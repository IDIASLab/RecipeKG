My husband got a recipe from a bartender friend of his. We all liked the spicy olives so much I decided to use them in the dip. Perfection! I purchase the large \"Queen Olives\" from Costco. You pour out the olive juice and add a splash of lemon juice fresh cracked black pepper and lots of Tapatio hot sauce. You can use any brand we just like Tapatio flavor. Shake it all up and let it chill. There really good by themselves too. I use fat free cream cheese and fat free mayo. It still tastes great. Thanks for the recipe!",

That recipe called for 6 ounces of cream cheese, softened, and 2 TBSP of olive juice(from the jar of olives.)It also called for the 1/2 cup of mayo, 1 cup of chopped salad olives (drained) and 1/2 cup of chopped pecans; also dash of pepper. Hope this helps those who had consistency problems with their recipes. It is best to make the night before, as it starts out mushy but firms up overnight. Very good on melba toast!",
