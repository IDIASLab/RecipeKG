Only thing that wasn't noted was to cook the chicken before you mix it with the other filling ingredients. I cooked mine in a skillet after seasoning the meat with chicken fajita seasoning. I also used regular long grain white rice as I am too cheap to buy instant rice. I used about 1/2 cup dry to 1 cup of water and cooked for 15 minutes then added to the filling. I figured this way it wouldn't be all mushy after baking the pie. Will definitely make again!!",

It had been on my menu for almost a month and kept getting pushed into the next week so glad I FINALLY got to make it! I did make a few changes based on our personal preferences. I left out the black olives and the corn. Instead of Salsa I used 1/4C of Taco Sauce that needed to be used up. I also took the advice of Josh's Mommy and cooked my regular rice for 15minutes because I'm also to cheap to buy the instant rice! I threw in a handful of Monterey Jack Cheese that needed to be used up as well! I cooked the cubed chicken the night before and will do this next time as well but will shred it instead of cubing. This will definately be making it into the rotation of meals as we all enjoyed it! Thanks so much for such a simple recipe!:) Note the chicken does need to be cooked prior to adding it to the pie and you'll need a full 8oz bag of cheddar cheese",
