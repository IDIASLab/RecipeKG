I cooked about 2.7 lbs of flank steak in the crock pot for about 5 hours on low. It was tender considering the type of meat and cooked to perfection. DEFINITELY do not cook on high for 8 hours! I was at home and was able to keep an eye on it. The taste was perfect. This was my first time cooking flank steak and would probably just buy chuck roast next time because it is more of a tender cut and is cheaper from what I can tell. Not sure of the benefit of flank over chuck. Taste wise not overpowering but throw in some extra veggies.",
