Anyone who is using Phyllo dough for the first time.. follow the directions on the box first. I had never heard of Phyllo dough and didn't think to read the directions on the box, as most recipes tell you not to follow those. And put a layer of either a cling wrap or aluminum foil down BEFORE the towel. Might sound like a duh thing for most, but for any of the other newbies out there, hope this helps!",

I'm not a huge bbq sauce fan but bf is so I thought this would be a good thing for us to try. I thought it was okay for a bbq sauce laden dish but bf thought it was a bit weird and I'm thinking it's the italian seasoning that makes him say that. I did change it up slightly as I left out the butter and used Grands flaky biscuits instead of phyllo dough (I tore the biscuits apart--very easy as they flake and managed three layers of dough that way with one container). It worked pretty well that way although I am sure the phyllo makes this lighter so I made a bit of a heavier dish. I halved the recipe so we wouldn't have weeks of leftovers (it's just the two of us!). It's quite easy just takes a few steps. Overall this is good; I think we just aren't too sure about the Italian seasoning part. Thanks for the recipe!",

We cooked the chicken used three small yellow peppers a small red onion and a bottle of sweet baby rays BBQ sauce (very mild... would be great with some heat if desired). Only put the croissants on top put a layer of cheese below and above the croissants (Made it cheesy but not tooo cheesy) was great! Kind of like a lasagna BBQ chicken pot pie...turned out fabulous!!! Will be making again with these changes. After trying with the croissant.. not to anxious to try with the phyllo dough!",
