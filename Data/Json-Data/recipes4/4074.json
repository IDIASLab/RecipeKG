To make it creamier I increased the fluid to equal 1/2 cup. Also used light Alfredo sauce. I used 6 cloves of crushed garlic to heighten the flavor. With the extra fluid it can be made ahead of time refrigerated and cooked later without drying out. Next time I will try spinach tortellini for a different flavor. This will definitely be a recipe called upon when leftovers are abundant.",

The packaging of the tortellini I bought was bigger than the recipe called for but the sauce mixture covered it just fine.

I'm sure I will use chicken and other pasta in the future if the need arises. I'm kind of looking forward to that!",
