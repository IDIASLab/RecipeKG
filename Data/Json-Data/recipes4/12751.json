I'm not sure if she saw a recipe that called for green salsa and she put in the red or if it was really called something else. Whatever the story, I've made it a couple of times now and absolutely love it. It gets better every time! Slow cooking the roast in an oven roasting bag makes the meat so tender!  Serve the pork with tortillas or hard taco shells.",

My bf had leftovers (eaten spooned over tortilla chips - with all the fixins) and also enjoyed it (and he HATES leftovers - lol). Very good! I was skeptical at first... my roast when taken out of the slow cooker had a lot of fat on it (which grosses me out!). After I shredded the meat it was perfect! I followed the directions to a T except for halving the recipe for my bf and I (I have lots of leftovers for tomorrow and the weekend even after me having two servings and my bf having 4!!!). Served with soft corn tortillas shredded lettuce and cheddar cheese chopped tomatoes fresh lime and sour cream. Next time I'll prepare with green salsa or either top each helping with some. This goes particularly well with Spanish rice. Thanks for sharing such an easy recipe!",
