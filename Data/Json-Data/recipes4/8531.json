There is enough salt in parmesan cheese and hubby has to watch his salt. Did not notice any lack. Might try different spice/herb combos just for the fun of it. I only made two, because this was a last-minute dinner decision for just the two of us, and loved the ability to do just that! Thanks for this great recipe!",

For a more defined shape you can pile the shreds up a bit but this is more sensitive to the time.",
