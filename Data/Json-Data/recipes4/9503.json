There was no way they would have stood up to being dipped in the chocolate - they just weren't that sturdy. What I ended up doing was mushing a ball together and putting it in a little truffle foil and pouring chocolate candy coating (also called chocolate almond bark) over the top. Don't let the mashed potatoes gross you out - you can't taste them at all. I'll definitely play with this one and leave more comments if I figure out how to get them to form better balls.",
