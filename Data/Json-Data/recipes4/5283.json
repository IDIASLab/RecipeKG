I sauteed a small chopped onion, dash of red pepper flakes and 2 minced garlic cloves until translucent.  Then added the chicken, salt, pepper, a dash or two of dried oregano and basil.  This really upped the flavor without adding a ton of calories and turned it into a 5 star dish.  Yum, yum.  Thanks for sharing.",

Aside from simply substituting it for rice I am always on the prowl for easy dinners that use it. This recipe looked like just the ticket for a quick mid-week dinner, except it did look a little bland, and my husband is not keen on asparagus. I had a bag of frozen spring vegetables with a cracked peppercorn seasoning (PictSweet Steamables) so I substituted that for the asparagus, there was red pepper in it, as well as a small amount of asparagus and some zucchini and green beans. So it seemed on par. Looking at other reviews, I also added some minced garlic, chopped onion and some Penzey's Tuscan Sunset spice blend (it's an Italian Style seasoning.) My husband walked in the door as I was cooking and exclaimed that the house smelled FANTASTIC. Another reviewer had mentioned that the meal was only 9 Weight Watcher points. He's on WW so when I told him that he was even happier. This easy to prepare meal, with ingredients I usually have on hand, will definitely be in the regular rotation!",

I have never used quinoa before. As an experiment I bought some red quinoa and tried this recipe. I used coconut oil (no flavor) cut up chicken thighs and per some suggestions some garlic green onion pepper basil oregano and a pinch of sea salt. HOLY COW! It was so good I was amazed and the nutty flavor of quinoa reminded me a bit of Chinese flavoring (think Cashew Chicken). I am now a quinoa convert as is my husband AND my 3 year old!
