                "reviewBody": "Pulled pork roast is a huge hit around our house and last year, my son asked for a pulled pork \"meatloaf\" for his birthday dinner.  He told me he thought it just \"sounded good, Mom.\"  I'd never heard of such a recipe and finally came across one.  It was an even bigger hit than our pulled pork sandwich recipe!  This recipe is almost exactly the same as the one we found a year ago, only difference is our original recipe calls for 4 cups of pulled pork and I don't chop the pork up further, just leave it shredded.  'Tis easy to add or take away veggies from the loaf, just listen to your tastebuds.  Whether you use 3 cups or 4 cups of pulled pork, do keep with the 2 eggs.  I typically make two loaves using a total of 8 cups of shredded pork and 4 eggs.  We always make this recipe using our favorite mustard BBQ sauce made with balsamic vinegar (not found on this site yet) along with Sweet Restaurant Slaw (found on Allrecipes.com).  This is a wonderful recipe; folks may be surprised just how good!",

I used celery instead. I really had no idea how this was going to come out but everyone liked it. I think I had way more meat than what was called for so I probably should have added more milk cuz it was dry even though I added another egg. But some brown gravy seemed to help and it was gobbled up and voted To Be Made Again!",
