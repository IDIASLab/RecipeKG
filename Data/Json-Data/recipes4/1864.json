                "reviewBody": "*Revised* Note: vegetables should be roasted at 400 degrees, not 350 (no preboiling - it saps flavor and prevents carmelization). Because of the different cooking temperatures, I roast the veggies and chicken separately. (If you only have 1 oven, preroast the veggies first, set them aside, and then cook the chicken.  When chicken is done, let it rest under foil, increase the oven temp, and finish roasting veggies.  That way, by the time the juices have settled back in the chicken, the veggies are hot and done.)  I find that adding a little water to the glaze SIGNIFICANTLY improves the color and texture.  Otherwise it will be too thick when cooked.  Also, to avoid burning the glaze, pour over chicken 15 minutes before the timer ends instead of 20 min.  You'll definitely want to make extra sauce to serve on the side.",

On the downside the chicken took much longer to cook than the given time of 1hr 20 min. Our 3.5lb chicken took a bit over 2 hours at 350! Next time around I will add the veggies in at the same time as I start cooking the chicken because they also took a much longer time to \"brown\" with the glaze (I had to broil for a few minutes). I would still add the glaze in at the last 20 min to avoid burning. I will also SKIP parboiling the potatoes and carrots as they never really carmelized by boiling and then roasting.

Meanwhile I cooked the sauce which I doubled cut back on honey a bit added more garlic. Microwaved only the carrots & potatoes until tender but still crisp. Dumped all veggies around the chicken as stated poured on the sauce over all baked 15 minutes more to carmelize sauce! The chicken cut up cooks quicker than the whole bird. Total time baking was 1 hour. Served with Jasmine rice with the yummy sauce on top! YUMMY!",

I think chicken thighs taste wonderful when done in the oven, better than breast (probably due to the higher fat content).  I put the veggies in the microwave (in a covered corning ware with a splash of water) for 8min; this is a good trick! They come out as if they are steamed (much quicker than boiling for 20min and you don't loose all the nutrients in the boiling water).  The mushrooms tasted particularly great.  The sauce smells great while on the stove.  However when everything was done, my husband and I thought it was too sweet, next time I will use 1/2 to 2/3 of the honey.  I didn't use apples because I was skeptical, but I could see they would go very well, will try next time.",
