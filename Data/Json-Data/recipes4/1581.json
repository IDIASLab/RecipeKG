If you use dried rosemary make sure you strain the marinade before basting or you will have chewy leaves.

If you use a good pan (hubby's a chef lol) and throw a top on it the spices will cook into the meat and it's perfect. From there we strained the rosemary and chives and made a rioux to add to the juices. This thickened it perfectly and it went BEAUTIFULLY over rice. Overall dinner was fantastic tonight.",
