I substituted the veal and steak with ground turkey (less fat), I seasoned the meat and added chopped onion while browning and I added chopped mushrooms to the simmering sauce.  Plus I was only patient enough to let it simmer for about 45 min.  I used it as a lasagne sauce.  The sauce was slightly runny when I assembled the lasagne, but thickened quite nicely in the oven.  My husband said it was restaurant quality.  I gave half the lasagne to my mom, and she asked for the recipe because she & her husband liked it so much!  I will definitely make this again!",

Its AWESOME !!!!\n\nI did make a few changes to it I used Hot Italian sausgaes instead of sweet, 1/2 tsp of thyme a dash of salt and used ground beef instead of the steak. I also like vegetables in my sauce so I added some onions, celery and mushrooms. I added 1/5 a cup of red wine near the last 15 minutes of cooking as well. \n\nNext time I might add a little sugar.\nIt was great, this one is a keeper. \n\nThank you!",

I used ground beef ground veal and sweet basil Italian sausages. I also added a splash of red wine about 15 minutes prior to serving but I only let the sauce simmer for 1 hour. My family was starving at the time and the aroma made it impossible to wait any longer. The recipe made enough sauce that I could freeze half. The sauce would be great for lasagna too so I'll try that next time. I will make this again and again and again! Thanks Grandma!!!",

The meat in the dish was so overwhelming you can not really taste the tomatoes or any of the garlic I even let it simmer for an extra hour to no avail. This was a bland and heavy sauce I don't even want to eat the leftovers.",
