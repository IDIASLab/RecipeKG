Which might not make this 100% paleo (not great with this yet!). I use turkey chorizo and no nitrate no fillers apple maple chicken sausage, 1 pkg each.. 1 very large sweet potato, fresh mushrooms sliced (the smaller sized package) about 1/2 a large red onion diced & about 8-10 small sweet peppers cut up.. to speed things along, i toss in a table spoon or two of unsalted chicken stock and close the lid (helps the potatoes and adds a little flavor) I also toss in a couple tablespoons of pimenta moida (Portuguese hot chopped peppers) just before I add a full bag spinach at the very end. Be careful with that if you don't like heat! :)",

I cooked the eggs in the hash for the photo but I poached some extra as well:) My family really loved it!",

Next time I would cook the turkey/chicken sausage first as some of it didn't really hit the pan because the chorizo was in the way so it took longer. I had trouble draining all the fat from the pan so I used some paper towel to swab the decks and it worked well to clean up the grease. After adding the cubed sweet potato I covered it with a lid to help the cooking along and I added corn with the zucchini (some of which I grated so I could see if I preferred cubed or grated zuch in it...grated was the winner!) Absolutely delish thanks for another great recipe.",
