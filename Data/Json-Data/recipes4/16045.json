But since zucchini doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of flavor on its own, this needs some seasoning \u2013 just plain garlic comes to mind, tho\u2019 I used Penzey\u2019s Fox Point Seasoning, which is a light seasoning, perfect for vegetables.  Since I had chicken broth leftover from another dish, I used it in place of the water which I hope contributed a little flavor as well as making use of something I had open. Depending on how thick you cut your zucchini, use the 5-7 minutes cooking time only as a guide.  Zucchini cooks quickly, so be careful not to overcook.",
