My only dilemma with the recipe was having no gluten-free stock of any kind at last minute on Thanksgiving day in the my house and all my bouillon had some sort of gluten or cornstarch in it...due to an inlaw that can't eat corn...I resulted in, using ham broth. Yes, it was the only source I had to take, so I used a 1 to 1 ratio (1 cup ham broth and 1 cup water) Due to the sodium intake of the broth I just deleted the salt in the recipe. However, it was so yummy and my GF inlaw and others that aren't GF totally enjoyed this recipe to the hilt! It's going to be a repeat happy offender in my house. TY",

I then used the original recipe inside a pumpkin and baked at 175 C for about an hour and it was moist as is. The pumpkin obviously having juices did the basting for me and added a very nice, but subtle, flavor. The third time I made this I halved the bread and then by mistake, left all the other ingredients as the original size and this rendered it a bit mushy but quite flavorful. I rebaked after fluffing with a fork and left it to dry on the counter overnight (my house is cold) and it is delicious. It tastes like traditional stuffing this way. I would say to double to thyme and sage. I used plain gf bread and it was fine. If you want a traditional stuffing make this one upping the herbs a bit. Make it for the whole family, even non gf people will enjoy this. I made this for dinner one night with cheese and cranberry sauce, once for Thanksgiving and again just for a regular chicken dinner. It is fantastic for every day as well as special occasions. I used Stuffed Pumpkin II as the recipe for baking inside a pumpkin. Really very tasty.",

Update: I made this again for our family Thanksgiving and used a different bread. This bread was not as dense as the Udi's brand. If using another lighter airier bread add less broth!  It was way too mushy no matter what we tried. Also use a shallow pan and not a deep one.",
