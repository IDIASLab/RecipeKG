                "reviewBody": "For the meatballs I used day-old whole wheat bread and omitted the Maggi seasoning (only because I didn't have it). For the \"gravy\" I didn't have bouillion granules so I used Campbell's beef broth and I added a mess of fresh garlic as well as fresh baby bella mushrooms instead of canned and I sauteed them with the onions with a little butter before I added the gravy ingredients. The meatballs turned out tender and juicy which we all agreed was very nice. I'm glad I omitted the Maggi seasoning because I think if I hadn't this dish would have been way too salty. I think the addition of the full cup of cornstarch was overkill. Next time I make this I'll cut it back to a tablespoon or so. The gravy was way too thick. Using condensed cream of mushroom soup is a great thickener all that cornstarch is unnecessary. My husband and I also thought there was a little too much sour cream. I think cut it in half and it would be just right. I think using fresh ingredients and canned beef broth was a great step for this dish. Like I said if I hadn't had to make a last minute substitution it would have been WAY too salty. I'll make this again with my changes. NOTE: I stand by my review only because I think had I not made the changes I did it would not have been edible. You can sub low-sodium products when necessary but this recipe is full of them.",

I also used 6 oz of fresh sliced mushroom. While this recipe has the taste of a typical hamburger stroganoff I found it didn't own the depth of flavors that my favorite stroganoff by Ken in CA created. That being said it proves to be \"kid friendly\". I also didn't care for the onions and mushrooms texture since they weren't sauteed first. The onions were still a bit crunchy. Thanks for sharing.",
