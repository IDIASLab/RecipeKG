The first time I prepared it, I used nuts, but did not the second time and didn't miss them at all and also cut back 1 tablespoon olive oil by not using nuts.  Just trying to cut calories!  One problem, however, with the recipe, it doesn't give instructions on if the garlic is to be used whole, or cut up. the second time I prepared this, I sliced the garlic to bring out the flavor and it made a positive difference. I also cut up the Kale into bite size pieces so it would be easier to eat.  Great taste!",

(She really won't eat it if she doesn't!) My grandpa liked it so much he took my bowl when I had my backed turned to take the cornbread of the oven!:) No leftovers! Changes: Unless you buy raw cashews they are roasted. I had some & used them. I bet this would be even better with freshly roasted cashews. Wow. I I had used a little of the bunch of kale for another recipe. I tried to cut a bit from the center places that looked tougher. I used a bag of baby spinach minus a little since that is what I had. I used a medium sized shallot since that is what I had (& I'm not as crazy about onions) I used 3 garlic cloves because I had fewer greens & I tend to find garlic overpowering. This was just right for me though most people I know would probably be happy with the whole amount. I will probably try 4 if I have the proper amounts. Also unfortunately I only had black pepper instead of white. It was still wonderful. I made this with \"Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread\" & ham for an easy quick dinner.",
