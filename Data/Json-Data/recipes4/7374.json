Firstly I had no Chia seeds. Since I assumed they were an egg replacement I instead used two eggs (added in with the dry ingredients in the first mixture) and lowered the amount of \"buttermilk\" by 6tbsp. I say \"buttermilk\" because I subbed plain yogurt mixed with a bit of whole milk to dilute to buttermilk consistently. Left out sunflower seeds but added flax seeds. Baked according to directions but only needed 20 minutes at the lowered temp before it was beautifully done. Great bread nice consistency. Thanks!",

My favorite right now (I ve never tried it with the prunes as I opt for savory) is to add a good rounded teaspoon or so - I never measure - of dried Italian seasoning right to the grains before grinding; adds a wonderful herbal flavor. I always make two loaves at a time as the recipe doubles beautifully. Also- try making the batter and letting it soak for the day before baking to increase digest ability??",

My friend accidentally poured all of the buttermilk in at once and we realized right away that the amount called for in the recipe was way too much by roughly 3/4 cup. The dough was liquidy. We decided to double the rest of the ingredients (not including buttermilk) and make two loaves from this large batch (one sweet - walnuts rehydrated dried apricots and chopped apples; one savory - chopped marinated artichokes black olives and jalape\u00f1os). While both loaves tasted nice they were incredibly dense and didn t rise much. The cooking time stated was too long (after lowering the temp as called for in the recipe we only needed 20 more mins). Additionally although we greased the loaf pan generously the first loaf still stuck to it. For the next loaf we lined the pan with parchment paper and it was much better. This was time consuming and frustrating. I still want to get a good buckwheat bread in regular rotation so I m going to try Googling some recipes instead.",
