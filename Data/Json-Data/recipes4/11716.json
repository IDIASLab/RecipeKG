I cut the chicken into large chunks and that could be why it cooked in 3-4 hours. The chicken and the ground pork were very dry. Also the sauce was very bitter with only the vermouth. I had to add quite a bit of salt and a few big scoops of sugar to lessen the bitterness. I cook by recipes mostly and am not that great at modifying a base with vermouth only. So others may know just what this recipe needs. Linguine was a good pasta for this.",

Also I used chicken broth instead of the vermouth in the main recipe. You can make a lot more sauce than the recipe calls for and I think that it really adds to the dish. I used about 1/4 cup of bisquick (instead of cornstarch) and more chicken broth (instead of water) to make the sauce and it was delicious over the chicken and thin spaghetti I served it with. You can not go wrong with a low fat/low calorie/low carb meal that tastes this good!",
