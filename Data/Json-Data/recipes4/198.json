I tempered my choclate, so I would get that crisp, dry chocolate shell that does not need to be refridgerated. I have made the coconut eggs several times and I even bring them to barbeques. Everyone is amazed how wwonderful and professional these taste. I HIGHLY recommend tempering your chocolate and using onlu milk chocolate for that real candy taste. I also recommend that your FREEZE the eggs before dipping them into chocolate. Dipping into chocolate can sometimes me tricky or difficult if you are new to it, you may find it to be messy, but it takes time, patience, and practice to get the hang of it.",

Two things: 1) You need more chocolate than is recommended. I'd buy an extra bag and just melt as much is necessary when you get to the bottom (it also depends on how large you make them). 2) Dipping them in the chocolate is kind of difficult (without making a ridiculous mess). Something really easy is to use chopsticks or skewers as chopsticks. It makes it so you can cover the entire candy without having large holes of missing chocolate.",

Once \"unskewered\" use the pastry brush to fill in the hole.   The result were beautiful eggs and you'll have plenty of chocolate.",
