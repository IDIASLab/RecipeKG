I took a chance and threw this together from what I had on hand and it turned out great! It can be as simple or as fancy as you want. My picky 5-year olds and husband enjoyed it (except the spinach), so that pretty much makes it a keeper.",

I stayed very close to the recipe, only using chicken broth instead of water.  I feel this is a great place to jump from, to customize to your family's tastes.  For us, it was a bit bland, and would have benefited from some onions, from fresh garlic instead of powder, and from a bit of cream at the end to give the sauce some oomph.  Overall, it is a solid recipe, and a great way to work in some veggies.",

This is a recipe with basic instructions, and then one fills in the blanks with what's in the fridge at the moment.  I used chicken stock and water instead of plain water; and used red bell pepper, celery, and onion for the veggies.  This was the first time I ever cooked pasta this way.  I was a little nervous that it wouldn't cook completely, but it was awesome - absolutely love that was all prepared using one pan.  I'll definitely try this again, and again will use whatever veggies and seasonings are available at the moment.",
