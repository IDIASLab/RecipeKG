I used Uncle Ben's Spanish Style ready rice and it wasn't seasoned that much. Then instead of using the Mexican-style stewed tomatoes I used fire roasted diced tomatoes that I had on hand. I decided to taste it and it was a bit bland. I decided to add 1 tea. black pepper and 1/2 tea. cumin and 1/2 cup Pace Medium Picante Sauce. This is a great start for a soup but next time I think I am going to add some more ingredients like maybe some green chili or jalapeno's. I may even try what some of the other reviewers added. Thanks for the easy making starter soup!",
