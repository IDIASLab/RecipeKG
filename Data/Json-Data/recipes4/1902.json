I let it cook on high in my crock pot for 10 hours.  I wished I could have let it cook on low for 18 hours or so as some reviewers suggested, but I just didn\u2019t have the time.  Luckily, I didn\u2019t matter!  Yummy!  (Only a little salty \u2013 next time I\u2019ll add only 1 tsp of salt with the ham hocks)  It went great with some Jiffy cornbread, and passed the boyfriend test with flying colors!  (He said it was BETTER than mom used to make!)  I\u2019m giving the recipe 3 stars due to the lack of spices. However the reviewers get 5 stars because I don\u2019t think it would have been nearly as good without their recommendations.  Overall it averages out at four stars.",
