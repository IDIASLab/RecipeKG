I first tried it with strawberry/banana jello because I live out of country and it was the only flavor of sugar free to be found. I thought it tasted a bit like a banana split! When a visiting friend brought the lime jello I made it with lime and found it to be excellent. It is not going to rival REAL key lime pie but if sugar and flour have been banished from your eating plan this makes a very satisfying substitution. (We also don't have coconut extract. I've been using vanilla most of the time.)",

Then poured it into the KitchenAid bowl & went from there. I let the crust sit in the fridge for 1 hour & the finished pie for 5 hours. Lots of filling that I had to pile up- but it worked!

I am not a lover of Key Lime Pie but I could not resist since I have not been able to have a piece of pie since I started my Low Carb Diet to reduce my blood sugar as I am Diabetic. This was amazing! I love the Pecan Crust that was my favorite part and I will be using it to make other kinds of pie. I am trying to figure out a way to make a Coconut Cream Pie! I think I beat the cream too long because my pie came out a bit 'tough' but it was still delicious! The Coconut was a definate show stopper! Yummy! It is very rich so I was only able to have 2 pieces (I saved up my carbs all day so I could really go crazy but it was too rich and that is not a bad thing). I thought that crust and the pie could have had more Splenda added to them as they were not sweet enough for me but I like things sweet. All in all this was an excellent experiment and I am going to have fun making as many different things as I can from this! For Low Carbers out there like me it is a definate winner!",

It's nice and sweet with a soft cheesecake-like texture. It was very yummy. I loved the crust. I am going to use that crust more often for other pies that I make. I will also try this pie with different flavors of Jell-o. Don't eat too much of it though. It may be low-carb and that's great but it's very fatty. Pecans are fatty so is cream cheese and heavy cream of course. I just ate a piece and now I'm headed to the Gym.",
