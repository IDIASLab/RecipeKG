After reading the other reviews I decided to use some of the other cook's advise with great success. I baked the potatoes on the oven rack after slathering with EVOO and kosher salt (lightly). The tuna mixture was seasoned with 2 tsp Old Bay Seasoning 1/3 cp maoy and 1/3 cp sour cream along with the scallion onions. My husband was thrilled and announced \"now this is comfort food!\".
