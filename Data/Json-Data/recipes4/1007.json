If you use the egg cut it in half. Both times I added creamy italian dressing for a little extra flavor. I would say this is a must. You really need something to give it a kick. Already we are thinking of what other hoagie ingredients we can swap out for a new taste. I used crescent rolls and liked the taste but it is a little greasy. Definately use low fat meats.",

This recipe really is more interesting and special when made with the crescent dough. Also 2 eggs are plenty. Finally a good addition was to saute a red pepper cut into strips in olive oil and garlic; place between the meat and the cheese layers. Prior review: This turned out well; my husband and brother loved it. For me I recommend adding \"flavor\" and \"color\" items such as herbs tomato slices or sun dried tomatoes mushrooms spinach thinly sliced sweet onion and/or marinara sauce. Nevertheless this was good just as is...",

My favorite so far is substituting pizza dough for the crescent rolls that the recipe calls for. The crescent rolls have a slightly sweet taste to them that I don't personally care for. I also put italian dressing on over the last layer of cheese then the egg over the italian dressing. After brushing the top layer of bread (crescent or pizza dough) I sprinkle garlic powder and parmesan cheese. I also use all Provolone cheese since I don't like Swiss cheese. Very good lots of compliments and the whole family agrees that they like the pizza dough version the best. They like the consistency of it. I may try it with pizza sauce instead of italian dressing next time! Thanks for the wonderful recipe and a basis to start with that I could play around with!",

I briefly microwaved the salami and pepperoni to render some of the grease. I didn't have any swiss cheese so I substituted a good quality deli sliced American cheese. Sprinkled the meat with some oregano and sliced hot pepperoncinis to make it more hoagie-like. My husband and I really liked the finished dish. He thinks I should use some tomato sauce next time to make it more like pizza but I think that would defeat the purpose of a \"Hoagie Bake\". I was looking for a way to use up a pound of dry salami I had in the fridge and this was perfect. Will definitely make this again.",
