I scrubbed three potatoes, poked holes, and microwaved them for 5 minutes to get them started and to save time in the oven.  I put the olive oil in a baggie and rolled them around in it (careful, they were hot!), then rolled them in some kosher salt on a plate.  I used my finger to evenly distribute the salt so it wasn't too clumpy.  Then I baked the potatoes at 350 degrees for 40-45 minutes - no foil, just right on the rack.  I did put a cookie sheet underneath and I'm glad I did because it caught a bunch of oil & salt the dripped off.  When they were done, we loaded them up with butter, sour cream, and a little pepper (my hubby also added bacon bits).  They were really good!  My husband even ate the skin and he never eats the skin from baked potatoes.  I'll definitely make these again!",

I usually have the oven on 350 or 400 degrees depending on how much time I have for them to bake. Baking them longer (2.5 hours or so) at 300 is great, but I usual don't have that kind of time. I coat these with the oil, and then generously sprinkle crushed sea salt and then sprinkle garlic powder on them. Of course, we love garlic, so this is yummy to us. Our family then top these a variety of ways.   Oh, I put these directly on the rack in the oven and have a drip pan on the next rack down to catch anything. This works well for me.

The potato will pop open along this line, revealing its fluffy-snow insides!  Top with cheese, sour cream, a little butter, chives, sauteed mushrooms and onions, salsa, or whatever tickles your fancy. ",

Then I cover them with a dry paper towel and on top of that I place a couple of wet paper towels.  Bake on high for 10 to 20 minutes depending on size and number of potatoes.\nRemove top paper towels, sprinkle more salt/garlic if desired,turn potatoes over and cook another 5 to 10 minutes as needed.  The skins are always delicious, tender and crispy. I often make twice-baked or stuffed potatoes this way, with a variety of ingredients in the \"stuffing\".",

Poking holes in the potatoes, adding the olive oil over the skin, and sprinkling some kosher salt on top is definitely the way I'm going to make all our baked potatoes from now on (with all our typical add-ins, not what the recipe calls for)!  I always ate the skins before, but not because I thought they tasted good or anything.  However, the skins are worth eating with this recipe!!  I did change the temperature of the oven to anywhere between 350 to 400 degrees (depending if I'm making something else or what not) and they are always done in about 60 minutes.  Definitely worth trying, as I doubt you will be disappointed!!  :)",
