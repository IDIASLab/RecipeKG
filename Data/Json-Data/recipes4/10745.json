To my family it doesn't increase the heat just the flavor. Also 2 teaspoons of salt are just about right. Pork loin was on sale (and leaner than stew meat) so I used that instead. Most restaurants here make carne adovada too hot but this recipe is just right. It's a family favorite (though there are never enough leftovers).",

I took another reviewers advice and adapted it to the crockpot. I braised the pork stew meat in the oil added it to the crockpot then sauteed the onion and garlic and layered it over the pork meat then added the tomato sauce to the hot pan and scraped all those good bits off the pan before adding the spices. After pouring the sauce over the pork meat I cooked this meat on high for most of the morning. By dinner time it was perfect. Nicely flavored with quite a kick. We ate these wrapped up in soft taco tortillas with all the fixin's. Good stuff! I'd make it again. It's kind of like eating chili but it's not chili. NOTE: I had help with this recipe because I didn't know the difference between chili powders. I grew up with the knowledge there was only one kind of chili powder. Not so. If you go to your \"ethnic\" or \"mexican\" section of your supermarket you'll see a portion of mexican spices hanging on j-hooks in cellophane packages. They do have different kinds of chili powder and it is marked very clearly on the package. I used the New Mexico chili powder that's called for in this recipe. A whole cellophane package is the right amount for this recipe. I cannot stress enough that you don't want to use a regular hot chili powder for this recipe unless you're into that sort of thing. It'll be epically hot.",

I picked the pork out of the sauce and put it back in the oven with some juice leftover from cooking refried beans and cooked a while longer so I at least had seasoned pork to go with the dinner but I know nobody would have eaten it in the original sauce.",
