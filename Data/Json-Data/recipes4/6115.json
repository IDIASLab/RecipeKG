I didn't really expect this dish to turn out that great from how it looked from the prep time honestly. However the Cornish hens turned out juicy and there was enough salt from the olives. I think I will try it over wild rice but I just ate it by itself. It would be nice to skim some of the fat off since the liquid seems a little too fatty from the chicken. However definitely a great slow cooker recipe that's a keeper.",

It didn't look appetizing nor did it smell appetizing before, during and after cooking but it tasted GREAT!!  I cooked my hens a bit longer on a lower setting as I doubled the recipe.  Also, I never use garlic salt or powder (just fresh garlic) 3 cloves for this recipe and 2 twists on my sea salt grinder was all I changed.  I did remove the hens from the crock pot and set them in my broiler for approximately 7 minutes to brown the tops (just cause that's the way I like them :)  The end result was delicious as I served it over long grain wild rice (A MUST)!  There really wasn't a need for me to double the stuffing/juice as there was plenty!  My husband who LOVES green olives stated that I should not put as many in next time.....and I, who am NOT A FAN of green olives LOVED it just the way it was!!!!  My boys, 8-13 years old LOVED it just as it was!  Thanks for a different way of preparing my hens in the \"Slow Cooker\"!  LOVE IT!!!",
