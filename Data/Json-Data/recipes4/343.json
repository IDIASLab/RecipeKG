A couple of the reviews mentionned dryness so I cooked the noodles first. No problem with moisture.  Instead of whole wheat bread, I used polish rye.  I used the food processor since it is a hard bread and this worked well. I melted 2 tablespoons of butter in a skillet and then added the crumbs until butter was absorbed.  I think the adjustments made a creamier, more flavorful dish.",

I only used one can of sauerkraut that I rinsed and drained/pressed the water out of VERY well. I used two packages of kielbasa that I sauteed with a whole onion then drained off the fat. I also made my own breadcrumbs and cooked the egg noodles a bit before layering them in the casserole. This recipe makes A LOT so if you have a family who eats bigger servings then this would be eight servings. This filled a whole 9x13 glass baking dish. This was good but I think it could be better like with a thousand-island type homemade dressing using chopped pickles instead of cream of mushroom soup with mustard. Perhaps with sour cream and ketchup? As is it's a tasty casserole though.",
