I used frozen broccoli and once thawed in the broth, I took the vegies out and chopped them in my food processor. I didn't have any celery soup in the house, so I used a \"healthy\" cream of chicken instead. I added some of my own seasonings including cayenne for a little kick, otherwise I followed the recipe.

The only changes I made was doubling the amount of cheese (I used sharp cheddar for an especially zingy flavor) and adding one cup of shredded carrots since Panera has shredded carrots. My mom and dad both declared that this soup was as delicious as the Panera soup. This one goes into my family favorites recipe box!",
