I halved the recipe since it was just for me and my husband sauteed a small minced onion with the cabbage and tossed in two crushed chicken bouillon cubes while the cabbage cooked down. It added great flavor. After I tossed everything together I mixed in a beaten egg put it all in a casserole pan and baked it for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees putting cheese all over the top for the last 10 minutes. Yum! Can't wait to make it again. Oh yeah I used light mayo instead of regular and boiled the potatoes with 3 crushed garlic cloves which I forgot to take our when I whipped up the taters. They came out delicous!",

I had a good sized bowl of leftover mashed potatoes and a wedge of cabbage leftover from making coleslaw. I added a half of an diced onion with 1 Tablespoon of butter to a skillet & sauteed the onion for a couple of minutes - added the cubed ham and the cabbage with 1/4 cup of water. Covered and let the cabbage steam. Meanwhile I heated the mashed potatoes in the microwave - stirred them and added a Tablespoon of mayonnaise. When the cabbage was almost done - take the lid off and let the juices reduce. Stir in the potatoes. Done - all in less than 15 minutes. One skillet to clean up and a filling meal to boot. Thanks! This is comfort food.",

Sarah's most helpful review of adding an onion garlic & an egg & casserole-ing it could change that.;) I think we'd like it more with the potatoes chunky as in Bubble n Squeak; Skillet Ham Cabbage & Potatoes or one similar. I haven't tried those. I can see getting kids to eat cabbage this way though! Good one!:D I followed the recipe except for halving it & adding a quarter t paprika & one carrot (cooked with the potatoes the last ten minutes). Thanks for posting Oh one more comment: Even with halving this it filled a four quart pot. Yow.:D We're eating leftovers - okay I am; but I am the one that counts the most right?!?:)",
