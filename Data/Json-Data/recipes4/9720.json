I left out the bell peppers (Contadina Stewed Tomatoes already had some in their cans and its not overpowering either) and swapped the Tomato sauce for Tomato Paste. However do not use too much. In my opinion I prefer the beef broth. Add to much sauce/paste and it thickens into a pasta sauce which is great too but its not how I vision tortellini soup so i think keeping to the broth is best with all the additions! Thanks Donna. It tasted super delicious on the very first try!!!!!!!!!!! Now that's what I call a really good recipe!",

This was great because you can follow the recipe or you can tweek it to fit your pantry/fridge and still get great results everytime!! I added celery and 1 red bell and 1 green instead of 2 greens. I used a bit of Prego chunky garden combo sauce and a can of tomato paste in place of the tomatoe sauce and added a bit more spice since I used italian turkey rather then pork and the results were amazing. I ate it for breakfast and dinner the next day. I just couldn't get enough!!! Many Thanks!!!",
