I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except after sauteeing all the veggies I added 2 cups veggie broth along w/ th potatoes and simmered that until they were fork tender.  I then added 1 cup frozen corn and 1 can cream style corn and the rest of the spices.  (I however, did not add the garlic clove.)  It was delicious! 5*****'s after changes.",

As far as spices are concerned I added some cayenne and bay leaves plus a dash or two of red wine vinegar for balance. The result was very very yummy and I didn't really need flour thanks to the potatoes. My b/f and I are veggie so I'll add some good bread and wine; It's dinner!",
