Sort of a crazy recipe stuffing all those limes and lemons into the chicken- but it worked great. The mopping sauce is highly recommended. If you are only doing one chicken you could cut the mopping sauce recipe in half and you would still have plenty of stuff to mop on the ole bird. Follow the cooking directions and you will have perfection.",

I also wanted to jazz up my normal recipe which is usually just rubbed with simple spices due to my picky kids. I used an almost 8 lb chicken so I doubled this recipe. Instead of putting lime/lemon in the cavity I squeezed the juices into the can and also put some spices into the can. I placed the fruit wedges next to the chicken in the oven. I cooked it slow & low on 50% power for about 3 hours. The meat was SO juicy and tender and FULL of flavor. I highly recommend this recipe and method for beer can chicken!",
