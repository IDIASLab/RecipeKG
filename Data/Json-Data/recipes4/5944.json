While they were cooking, I melted 1/2 the butter in a pan on low heat and added in the garlic. When the sprouts were done cooking, I cut them in 1/2 and added them to the pan (turned the heat up), to allow them to brown. I flipped them and added in the other 1/2 of the butter, along w/ the salt and pepper. When they were done, I plated them and sprinkled the cheese on top. GREAT flavor, and something that I will be making VERY often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

They took far longer to cook then indicated in the recipe and began to burn so I had to turn the heat way down until they were done. Also by slicing them in half you loose a lot of the outside leaves as you are turning and cooking them. I would leave them whole next time and roast them in the oven then sprinkle with the parmesan cheese.",

I used many more than that!  Sprouts are sold here in the fresh produce in a net bag (maybe a pound?).  Quite a few...filled my skillet.  I used a tablespoon of butter and a little avocado oil to brown them. Added a little water (could use chicken broth) to help them cook.  Sprinkled on the cheese and seasonings and covered a minute to melt the cheese.  (No added butter.)  I think some walnuts would be a nice addition if you want to make it a little more special.  Very pretty side dish!  Thank you.",
