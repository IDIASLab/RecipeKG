Of course pasta is a first course in Italy and this one, in a \"primo-sized\" portion, is an ideal choice since it's light. It's also good with just olive oil, no cream. Some make it with ricotta (not my favorite...too gluey). We never cooked the walnuts. They grind well without that step and taste fresh. We didn't use chives or oregano, just the garlic and the marjoram, keeping it exquisitely simple. It's an uncooked sauce. This recipe is excellent. I just simplify it a bit. Also, try it on fusilli. The pasta holds the sauce so well!",
