Also sauteed some onions and used Mushroom soup with Roasted Garlic. Fat Free Sour Cream and 2% cheese limited the fat. I love the fat free white smoked meat Turkey Hot Dogs...so the recipe is a lot lower fat than the original. Whole Wheat noodles also helped. I diced up some zucchini and added that to the soup mixture as well to give it some REAL vegetable besides frozen peas. Doesn't hurt to mix it up a bit before putting it in the oven.",
