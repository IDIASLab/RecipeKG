I added a dab of butter to the rice as it cooked using beef broth rather than water and bouillon. Because I used fresh rather than dried herbs (including oregano rather than marjoram which is an acceptable substitute) I held off adding them until just before serving to preserve their vibrant color. Strictly for the punch of color I also added a handful of peas at the same time. I found this needed no salt but did give it several turns of fresh ground pepper. As the first reviewer of this recipe I'm pleased to say we enjoyed this simple and humble rice side dish very much.",

I too use low sodium beef veggie or chicken broth instead of water and bouillon as it's less salty. In place of butter I add a generous dollop of garlic oil (homemade with 1/2 evoo and 1/2 canola with 3-4 crushed cloves of garlic in the bottled oil and kept in the fridge). This oil adds a very mild hint of garlic and helps to keep the rice (or barley) from getting sticky. If the dish is still too dry for your taste you can add 1/8-1/4 cup of broth to the mix until it gets to the consistency you like. Just add the liquid in small increments. FYI There are some very good combos (often trios) of grains packaged in the markets. I like brown rice wild rice and barley in combo and often add curry powder to taste for seasoning. Don't be afraid to experiment as these grains are very forgiving!",
