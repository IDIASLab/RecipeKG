Assembled the quesadillas and baked half per the recipe and then pan fried half.  NOTE:  to keep the ingredients from oozing out, fold the quesadilla in half taco style ~ when finished cooking, let the quesadilla \"set\" for 1 or 2 minutes, then use a pizza cutter to divide into triangles.  Didn't tell the group which was which and they voted hands down for the pan fried, which I actually preferred too....  Doubled the cheese and used a mix of Cheddar, Monterey Jack and Pepper Jack cheese with the carmelized onion and BBQ chicken.  Wonderful!",

The only thing I would change is the cooking time in the oven.  It only took 5 minutes for the cheese to melt and for the tortilla to start turning crisp.",

The \"Carolina low carb bbq sauce\" and \"Dave's bbq sauce\". Since this recipe was called \"Texas\" quesadillas I figured the bbq sauce had to be a red sweet sauce. I baked covered in the oven the first 10 minutes for a slightly softer quesadilla. I liked the red bbq sauce but LOVED LOVED the \"Carolina low card bbq sauce (a savory sweet yellow mustard) on these!!! I will definitely make this recipe again and again!",
