I used the boneless thighs I had in the freezer which stayed nice and juicy. I used carrots and celery for the veggies and I might even use peas next time. Lastly I used onion soup mix as others had suggested. It turned out great and so amazingly easy to make. The only thing I might do different would be to use regular rice instead of instant. The rice was a little soggy for my taste. Thanks for this great recipe!",
