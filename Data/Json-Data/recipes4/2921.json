I did not but I will try doing do next time to see if it strengthens the flavors. Also I advise using more than one onion. The onion was the best at soaking up the flavors. The perfect bite had some chicken some onion and some rice - but there was not really enough onion. Definitely will make again. Nice subtle flavors. Distinct recipe option. Makes me want to try more Saudi Arabian foods.",

I also like that the rice is partially made with milk - it is a technique I will probably use in other dishes as well. In my area it was difficult to find cardamom pods so we used ground cardamom (3 tsp) instead. Not having a basis for comparison I can't say if it turned out the same but we thought it turned out very good. It was also an experience to try a Saudi dish as I had never had one before. I will certainly be recommending this recipe to others.",
