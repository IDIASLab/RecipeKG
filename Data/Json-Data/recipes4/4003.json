It sounded like a good base recipe, but I was expecting my review to say \"it needed something extra\".  Well, I finally made them tonight and all I can say is WOW! I was very pleasantly surprised that this simple burger ended up being very tasty and unique.  Only changes were to add a clove of garlic to the onions and celery and a little poultry seasoning (Bell's) and some dried thyme to the meat, and I used egg whites (from the carton) in place of whole eggs.   I scaled this recipe down to three burgers, using about a half pound of turkey. The burgers were so moist and delicious, and although I expected to want \"something else\" to pep up the cranberry sauce and cream cheese, the two toppings really worked well together, and complimented the flavors of the stuffing mix and turkey without overpowering them.  A wonderful recipe, and one that I will make again and again! Thanks, Hez!",
