When I first started using a bread machine my loaves would always rise up beautifully and then fall during the baking process. When I started adjusting for high altitude (we live at 7000 ft.) the problem was solved! I baked this bread from start to finish in the bread machine; I also added 3 T. gluten.",

The amount of water seemed way too much. The dough turned out more like a think batter. It rose very well but the surface was riddled with holes. The final product was very dense. The top was flat with a very thick and hard crust.Very unappealing appearance. The taste was OK I can still eat it just cant relish it. The taste was also slightly bitter.",
