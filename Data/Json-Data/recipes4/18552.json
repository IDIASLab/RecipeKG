It is perfect for both sweet and savory dishes. The trick is leaving large chunks of butter, whole, so they create a flaky crust. The baked crust holds its shape quite well and delivers a nice slice of filled pie beautifully without falling apart.",

The texture is nice after it's baked, but it is pretty difficult to roll out. No worries! Pressing it into the pie plate worked fine for me! Thanks for posting,  Buckwheat Queen!",
