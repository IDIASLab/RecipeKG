It's easy to control the heat by removing the seeds and ribs (the whitish membrane inside the pepper) before dicing to result in a dip that is mild, medium, or hot and spicy, to suit your taste. For a mild dip, remove all seeds and ribs. For a very spicy dip, leave all the seeds and ribs intact. Serve with sliced sourdough baguettes.",

I doubled the recipe but did not double the jalapeno because we have several family members who don't do heat very well. Next time I'm making a \"whimpy\" batch and a \"real\" batch with extra jalapeno. Because I doubled it it took a little longer in the oven to heat through. I got asked to make it again for the next function. Also my brother seems to think that this recipe with a few additions (bacon and either chicken broth or cream to thin it out) would make an excellent soup. Anybody try that yet?",
