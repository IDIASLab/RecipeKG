The spicy fermented cabbage adds a lot of extra savoriness, not only to the meat, but even more so to the vegetables. The potatoes especially soak up a surprising amount of flavor, and may be my favorite part of the whole dish. Garnish with sliced green onions.",

                "reviewBody": "I love kimchi so I was excited to try this. I thought it was great! I had a small corned beef so I cut most of the ingredients in half. I used half of the spice packet. I also used about 3/4 lb. of mild kimchi which came in a fancy pouch and 1/4 lb. of spicy kimchi thinking my kids might eat it (they weren't fans). Next time I'd up the spicy kimchi. I kept the full amount of potatoes though and added a softball-sized green cabbage cut into wedges. I cooked the corned beef in the pressure cooker let the pressure come down naturally then pressure cooked it again with the potatoes for about 5 minutes. When the pressure came down I added the other vegetables and simmered until tender. Great meal and terrific leftovers.",
