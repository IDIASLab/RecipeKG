Suffice it to say olive oil is a better option than cooking spray, fresh minced garlic preferable to garlic salt, and the Parmesan tossed with the asparagus before roasting rather than sprinkling it on afterward much tastier.  I found 10 minutes was adequate, and didn't bother turning it mid-way.  A little drizzle of fresh lemon juice and a light sprinkle of grated lemon zest make this particularly fresh and lively. Small changes easily elevate this to a 5-star rating.",

Instead of garlic salt, I used 3 cloves of minced garlic and a dash of sea salt.  Also, I used olive oil instead of cooking spray.  Olive oil doesn't have the chemicals found in cooking spray.  Finally, I added diced red onions and sliced mushrooms to the asparagus before baking everything.  This side dish was great with my baked salmon and white rice.  The soft red onions and mushrooms oozed into the white rice which added flavor to the rice.",
