I tried this and the balls were way to big and they fell apart. I made them much smaller like the size of a meatball in spaghetti and they came out great. Also I think the first time you make them the recipe is somewhat time consuming but I am sure once you are familiar with it it will be much quicker. However the end result was well worth the time! They were delicious! We all loved them and will make them again. Thanks for the tasty recipe!",

I didn't realize until I had already begun the recipe that it required the use of a food processor. So I tediously chopped everything up. I don't have access to Jasmine rice so I use short grain white rice instead. Unfortunately chopping the rice by hand (instead of putting it in the food processer like the recipe calls for) was not possible. As a result my rice cakes would not stick together. I therefore made \"Fried Rice with Sweet Potato Ginger Sauce\" Which as good as it tasted was definately lacking. This is WAY to tedious for me to repeat and if you don't have a food processor I say don't even try! UPDATE: I have made this a few more times -- WITH a food processor. I REALLY love the taste. So as long as you have a food processor and if you REALLY want to impress someone (who is opened minded to trying new foods) this really is an eye pleaser!",

I for the most part just threw most of my ingredients in the blender and added that chunky paste to my rice. I did boil my coconut milk and ginger but I had hungry men passing the kitchen acting as if they've never had a meal in their lives. I only added one egg and mixed it all together to make patties but it was kind of messy in the pan. I ended up creating a fried rice topped with pan fried tofu sauteed red peppers red onion cilantro fresh spinach and garlic. I really liked the saltiness of the tofu against the sweet potatoe and ginger. The guys weren't terribly impressed but they gobbled it down. I refridgerated what I didn't fry and thanks to the temperature I was able to make my patties and fried them up for lunch the next day for my neighbor and myself. She loved them. They taste better as golden rice CAKES not fried rice. Overall I enjoyed this recipe and plan to do it again. Maybe I'll follow the directions next time... or maybe I won't. Thank you for such a unique dish.",

The first time I didn't use a food processor and simply grated the carrots and chopped the onions and peppers finely. I mashed the rice together with the vegetables. This time I used the food processor. Similar texture and I have no preference. The amount of liquid for the rice however is off. The first time I used 4 cups of water since I \"knew\" 2 1/2 was far too low. My cakes were too wet. This time I followed the directions and the rice was so dry the cakes were falling apart. Next time I will try 3 1/4 cups. The other thing I noticed was that the sauce is highly dependnet on the texture of the sweet ptotato. My first one was saucy this time it was quite thick - more like a gravy. The thinner sauce was more appealing to the eye but we ate all of it both times.",

I have to confess that I used leftover brown rice cooked in chicken broth instead of jasmine rice with garlic but other than that I followed the recipe closely. I found it to be totally bland and I couldn't get the cakes to stick together while cooking. I even added an extra egg to the mixture. After tasting the first completed cake I added some several dashes of hot sauce and some brown sugar to the sauce which dramatically improved the flavor. If I make these again I will use regular onion instead of green in the rice mix and add a little habanero for a zestier flavor.",
