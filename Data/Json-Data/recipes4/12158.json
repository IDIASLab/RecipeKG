I put it in two deep dish pie crusts and cooked/fried the onions in oil and seasoned with granulated garlic and salt before adding to quiche to speed things up a bit and give it a good flavor. I left out the tomato. I used 1 cup of cheese instead of 1/2 c and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top. The italian seasoning was good but next time I will use just garlic basil and oregano individually as I don't care for italian seasoning very much. Basically you can add and leave out so many things as long as you stick to the base items and it will turn out incredible. Great taste and texture esp. if you don't like the egginess of regular quiche! 5 STARS!!! THANKS!!!",

I also only cooked the lentils for about 15 min. and stir-fried my onion to save time. This was just a fabulous dish!! Thanks so much for sharing!",

I also just mixed the lentils cheese (shredded cheddar and monterrey jack blend) and broccoli together in the pot I cooked the lentils in and then poured it into the dish. I also added a sprinkling of cheese on top. I only cooked my lentils for 10 minutes and I used a 9x11\" baking dish baked it for just under 35 minutes. Came out beautifully I think it would also be really good with cauliflower.",
