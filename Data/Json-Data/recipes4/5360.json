I sauteed the chicken in olive oil, generously added pepper, dash of salt.  Saved off chicken.  Added red wine (only because if prefer red wine, white will produce a better color) and stirred up the ruins from the chicken, added mushrooms.  Sauteed a couple of minutes, added the asparagus.  Stir about 1 min, add cream.  More pepper, dash of salt.  Stir per directions.  Add in tomatoes, stir, add back chicken.  Just before serving I added the garlic (maximizes nutritional value and flavor) and fresh basil.  I served over fresh spinach (I'm a gluten free girl), with a dusting of Parmesan. My husband went back for seconds and literally licked the bowl!  Thank's for the yummy recipe!",

My one suggestion would be to double the sauce because keeping everything in proportion there just wasn't enough sauce. However that being said this was a very good meal. I will admit to one other digression (sorry to those recipe purists who stick to the total recipe as written)----I used leftover chicken from another recipe but I did sautee it in butter and olive oil with the garlic very similarly to the recipe requirements.",
