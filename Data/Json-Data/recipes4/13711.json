I took this over to a casual family dinner and they said it was the best stir fry they had ever had. The only thing I ommitted was the ginger because I don't like it and I put a few more carrots and only 2 red peppers but followed exactly otherwise. I used the Chinese noodles but a thin spaghetti would also work fine. Very very good. Thank you.",

I also used fresh garlic and ginger- taste so much better then the dry. I used green onions instead of the white- just personal preference. I used only 1 Tablespoon of the sweet chile sauce and the rest I used the garlic chili sauce- we like spicy more than sweet. Instead of napa I used regular cabbage because I had that on hand from a corned beef. This is a forgiving recipe and you can really add or subtract your flavors veggies and spiciness based on your personal preferences. It made a HUGE amount of food. Thanks for sharing.",

One major change I would make if i were to make this dish again is to reduce the sweet chili sauce to less than 1/4 cup and the sesame oil to 1 Tbsp or less. Sesame oil has a really strong flavor and you don't need a lot. My dish was WAY too sweet and I'm surprised more reviews don't state that. Definitely add more veggies if you have them on hand. Shitake mushrooms would be a good too.",

This recipe doesn't say what to do with the marinade so I removed the pork and drained it well. I seared the pork first in a very hot wok and then removed it from the pan. Then I browned the onions peppers celery and carrot (which I grated) before adding the pork back in along with the reserved marinade simmered it a bit and then put in the cabbage and sweet chili sauce. For the noodles I used half sweet and half hot chile sauce and cut back the sesame oil a little. This was a bit labor-intensive with all the chopping but we enjoyed it very much.
