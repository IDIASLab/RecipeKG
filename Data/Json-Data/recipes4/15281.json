My husband said it was too \"busy\" with so many different veggies and that it tasted \"weird\". 15 month old who eats just about anything ate only 3 bites.",

We had lots of meat eating company so I double the recipe and cooked up Italian sausage separately as the vegetables cooked and put them all together in the baking pan (no lentils this time around). I forgot to add the cheese with the biscuits but with the extra spices on the meat that was fine. Everyone really liked this dish. Looking forward to making it again soon with the lentils!
