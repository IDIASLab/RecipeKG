Wrapped it up completely, sealing the top and put it in a 400C oven for 20mins.  After 20mins I opened up the foil and poured in a bit of red cooking wine. Cooked for another 10 minutes  It came out very moist and flavorful.  Bonus: Caramelize some onion, mix it with the cooked salmon and add a tablespoon of low-fat mayo. Mix it together, spoon onto bread of your choosing and ENJOY however you please. Ketchup for me",
