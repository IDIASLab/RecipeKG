If I'm making a small batch maybe just a quarter cup of each.  for larger salads (or if I'm making extras to keep for another day) I sometimes make it with a full cup of each.  Keep it simple :)  Also the water in my kale (if I've just washed it)waters down the dressing a bit anyway.",

It's also not the best tasting leaf in the world so the sweetness of the grapes and the dressing worked so well. Feta added the saltiness and voila! You have a terrific salad that is oh so good for you. Thanks Kristie for the keeper!",

I already had Honey Garlic Vinaigrette by DAWNER119 (also on this site) made up and in the refrigerator so I used that as my dressing rather than the one indicated in this recipe. The only other change I made was to use toasted almonds instead of walnuts. I cut the kale into about 1/4 strips and tossed it with the dressing. I then sprinkled on the grapes feta and almonds. It was delicious and one we ll be enjoying again! Thank you!",

Other than cleaning the kale it was very easy to prepare. I made a few small variations (1) I toasted the walnuts to bring out their flavor (2) I used blue agave nectar instead of honey. Though it is no better for you than honey to me it is more neutral than honey and lends sweetness while letting other flavors come through and I did do equal parts of the liquids in the dressing per the author's review of this recipe and I only added a little shot of water but wished I hadn't done that and (3) I added quite a bit of fresh ground pepper and a little salt to the dressing that was good it didn't need more. Next time I would probably try a softer goat cheese as one of the other reviewers did. Seems like it would add a nice creaminess that was lacking with the feta. Great recipe thank you!",
