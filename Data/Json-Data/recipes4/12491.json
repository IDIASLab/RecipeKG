I didn't have salt less herb blend or Italian seasoning so I opted for salt pepper thyme parsley flakes and 4 cloves of garlic. I also eyeballed about 2 cups of pre cut broccoli into the crock when putting everything else in. I let cook on high for 5 hours ish then added half and half. I'm not sure how much I eyeballed it. Probablly 1.5c. I know that sounds like a lot but I'm going for a creamier soup. I then thickened it with some corn starch as well. Added a final dash of salt pepper and thyme to tAste and let thicken for a half hour. I served hot with Parmesan cheese on top. Oh yeah. I also used 3 carrots and 1 onion.:) will be making again.
