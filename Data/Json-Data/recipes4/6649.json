We had leftover pizza toppings from when we cooked up a large pizza (refrigerated crumbled sausage, pepperoni, mozzarella). Needed to use them up so this seemed like the way to do it. The texture was just perfect on a preheated stone at 425 degrees on the bottom rack for about 10 minutes. Hot enough that the toppings were no longer cold and the cheese was just starting to slightly turn brown. Perfect!! That's my pic with the three on the clear plate. I think they were wonderful.",
