Glad I made extra of the filling because I wouldn't have \nhad enough to fill the 1st pie if I hadn't doubled it. I ended up adding raisins, walnuts, and oatmeal to the remaining batter and baked it as well for a next day breakfast treat. \n\n1 hour at 350 was too long for my oven and I ended up burning the edges a bit. That was on me though,  as I was not checking for doneness and just waiting for the timer.\n\nPie seems to have a very soft moist cakey consistency and just a mild apple flavor. Made the house smell great though. Added vanilla extract. \nMaybe top with a sprinkle of cinnamon to add flavor? \nWould probably have liked it more if the pie set a little firmer.\n\nRecipe was fun and easy to make though.",
