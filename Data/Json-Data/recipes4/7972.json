I made the mistake of breaking each egg into the bowl as it was already over the water, and it was very hot. My first egg actually started to cook! I have a springform pan with a glass bottom, so the cake doesn\u2019t have to be transferred to a plate; therefore, I didn\u2019t follow the recipe for lining the pan.",

I selected this one since it has no flour. My son is gluten intolerant.\nI am not a great baker - my strength is making pies - so I struggled a bit preparing the springform pan and understanding the whole water bath cooking procedure. With that tackled all went well. I topped it with a raspberry filling recipe I also found here on Allrecipes.\nAnd the result?  I have NEVER had such a positive reaction from everyone who consumed it. One son took a piece to share with his girlfriend and asked for the recipe (a first). The other son had two slices. My wife said this is a keeper. Thank you so much for making me look like a hero.\nI'm going to try this again and make two cakes to layer together. One layer will be semisweet and the other layer will be peanut butter.",
