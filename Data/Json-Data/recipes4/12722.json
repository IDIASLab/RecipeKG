For those of you who have the same situation or for a nice change of pace here's how: Just use 1 cup uncooked orzo and one can of chicken broth. No more liquid needed and keep the rest of the recipe the same cooking for approx. 15-20 minutes until liquid is absorbed. The previous reviewer didn't know what to serve it with but I think any chicken recipe would do. I made Easy Honey Mustard Chicken w/ Mozzarella and the flavors melded perfectly. Since I was making chicken I ignored the chicken part of this recipe making it much less time consuming. This was a winner!",
