Also, the original recipe could use more eggs and milk because the three eggs in the original recipe are absorbed by the hash brown crust. And because of this you get the taste of eggs but its not like your eating eggs like you would in a traditional quiche.I used 5 eggs and a cup of milk the second time that I made this and it came out much better.",

Original review - Pretty decent and easily modified with what you have on hand. Although...I decided the ham and cheese amounts excessive for 3 eggs (I even used XL eggs). So, I went with 1/2 C each of chopped smoked deli ham & shredded provolone (cheddar didn't appeal to me) and used 4 XL eggs. I used an 8\" pie pan and I had around 2.5 cups of shredded potatoes (I had to shred my own spuds).  I did toss the melted butter in the potatoes prior to forming a crust. I needed to use up red bell type pepper and 2 small green chili peppers that I had charred/peeled and diced. I used 1/4 C ea of 2% milk and sour cream in the eggs and seasoned the potatoes a little bit b4 baking. I mixed a few T each of minced grn onion, provolone, parm shreds and pre-cooked bacon bits and topped the quiche right before it was completely set. With the quiche 6\" from the flame I set to broil and a few minutes later...it looked and tasted great! I'll make this again with whatever I have on hand; but less meat/cheese then called for. Turned out 'just right' as dinner for the two of us with 1/2 leftover for day after lunch. Great starting point and easily modified. Thanks for submitting your recipe Candace  : )",

My version used ham and a mix of sauteed leeks broccoli and mushrooms. I also added an extra egg & a little extra milk giving it 35 mins at 350. I may have been overly generous with the melted butter on the crust because only the edges browned and the rest of it was 'foamy' so next time I'll try using a pastry brush and give it a light brush. We will definitely make this again thank you Candace!",

It appeared 3 cups was way too many, even after I mixed in the butter and packed into my deep dish pie plate. I baked the potatoes at 425 degrees for 25 mins. Next, I added my cubed ham and saut\u00e9ed onions and peppers.  I topped with a cheddar and Monterrey Jack cheese blend. Then, I added 4 beaten eggs (as previously suggested) mixed with the 1/2 cup of milk and spices. The mixture perfectly filled the pie plate. Finally, I baked for 20 mins, still at 425 degrees. It was enjoyed by all, except the picky non-hash brown eating kid.  I served it with cinnamon rolls and fresh fruit cups.  This recipe was simply delicious! Plus, there are endless possibilities!",
