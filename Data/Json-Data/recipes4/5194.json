I must say they are quite tasty and finding this lovely gluten-free recipe was a bonus for me! I did use the extra lobster meat mentioned above because I didn't want the fritters to be too \"bready\". I followed the recipe ingredients very closely other than not adding salt; next time I'm going to add finely chopped sweet red pepper. I crushed the GF crackers in my small food processor so that they were very fine. I used my deep iron frying pan and didn't need a quart of oil - just poured in about 1 inch. Just tasted one so I could write this review - delish! Even without sauce although I'll whip up something to serve it with later. I plan on freezing some as this recipe made about 34 nice sized fritters. Thanks for a great GF gourmet fritter!",
