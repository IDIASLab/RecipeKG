There is no need to brown the meat but I do recommend triming off as much fat as possible.  \r\nOne problem I had was that there was always too much gravy left over. I have recently discovered  that this recipe comes out just as spectacular using one can of soup and half a can of water. Do use the regular amount of onion soup mix.  It should be cooked to perfection in about six hours.\r\nI also have a suggestion on  the type of slowcooker used.  I first tried making this recipe in a small Nesco but it was not able to keep the roast completely immersed in the soup mixture.  I use a Rival.  It is 7 inches wide and about 5 inches deep. This is the most typical slowcooker around.  \r\nFinally a word on adding vegetables.  I tried adding carrots and potatoes to this recipe and for some reason the gravy was not very flavorful. For this reason I just leave them out.\r\nGood luck!",

I read pages and pages of the reviews & then took some of the suggestions and modified the recipe a bit.  The result was spectacular \u2013 I will be making this dish again and again.  Since there are just two of us I bought a 2.5 lb chuck roast and I lightly covered with a mixture of flour, garlic salt and dried rosemary and then seared all sides with a bit of unsalted butter.  I added baby carrots, sweet onion, small red potatoes and celery.  For the gravy I combined 2 cans of 99%fat free cream of mushroom soup, \u00bd a packet of onion soup mix, 1 tbs of Worcestershire sauce, \u00bc cup of red wine and 1 cup of beef broth & cooked on high for 4 hours and low for 2 hours.  The meat was so tender and the gravy was absolutely delectable.  It was a bit thin so I just thickened up with a bit of flour.  I served with cheese risotto (Safeway brand) and French bread.  I can honestly say this was one of the best meals I\u2019ve ever made\u2026. HIGHLY recommend.",

I decided to flour the roast with flour, granulated garlic, salt and pepper. Then I browned it on all sides in a little olive oil. While it was browning on the stove, I added the rest of the ingredients to the slow cooker, I also put in two 4 oz. cans of mushrooms. However, I substituded the water for beef broth (same amount) and when the roast was done browning, I put it in the slow cooker and covered it with the mixture in the slow cooker. I also cooked it on low for 4 hours then high for the rest of the time. It came out VERY tender. No need to thicken the gravy, because the flour thickened it while it was cooking. My picky 12 yr old daughter (who eats like a bird) ate some for dinner, then again when she got home that night, and my 9 yr old son asked me to make this more often. I served it with mashed potatoes and canned corn. It was the easiest pot roast I ever made!!",

In the last 3 hours cooking in the crock pot I added fresh carrots, green beans, potatoes & sliced onions.  YUM!

The next evening I was able to peel off over a 1\" layer of beef fat that had hardened on the top and reheat the pot roast in the oven. I realize this defeated the 'dinner ready when you get home' purpose of a crockpot but this process removed at least 1000 calories from the dish and it still tasted fantastic!",

I don't know why the reviews are so high, but this recipe isn't that great. The only thing that's great is that it's easy and quick to assemble. The flavor is pretty weak and the gravy was awful. I would never make this again and would rather do the extra work to have a roast that tastes yummy with gravy that IS gravy.",
