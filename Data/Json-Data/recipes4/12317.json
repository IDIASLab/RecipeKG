I imagine it would be even better as written but we are attempting to cut down on sodium and fat.With my changes it is much lower in sodium and fat. Next time I will add some jalapeno.",

It didn't seem like much as I was putting it together but once it had simmered and the oats had plumped up it was delicious. The toasted oats give the soup such a unique flavor. I used vegetable broth and I was out of onion; otherwise I followed the recipe exactly (I do think it could use a bit more garlic). My boyfriend who's a soup junkie loves this so much he wants to start making it on a weekly basis for his lunches. The beauty of this recipe is there's so much room for interpretation--you can use different fresh herbs and/or add in a few veggies for variety (I'm thinking basil pureed red pepper and mushrooms...mmm!). Bonus points for ease of preparaton.",
