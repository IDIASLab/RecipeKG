Not wanting to give up on it just yet, another cup or so of water was added and I continued to let it bake (adding more water after about 1/2 hour) until it was fluffy. It was slightly \"al dente\", but that might have been because it was brown rice. I did check the rice package afterward, and those directions called for 2 1/2 c. water to 1 c. rice, so I believe that was the source of the problem. I liked this method, so I'll make it again - just with more liquid at the onset next time.",
