My husband's uncle kept this recipe a secret for many years and would not share it with anyone; we had to wait until he passed away, and then my husband's aunt gave us the recipe. I made these for a Thanksgiving dinner we had at church, and now every time we have any sort of meal at church I am always asked if I going to make uncle Dick's potatoes. Even in the summer, this is what they want me to make. I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we do.",

This is one that ranks right up there with the best mashed potatoes I've ever had, and it actually instructs you to refrigerate overnight.  Is that convenient or what?  Out of the fridge, into the oven, and you have a mashed potato casserole that will WOW everybody.  Really, although very simple and basic, it is that good!",

However maybe it having not too strong of a flavor is a good thing so it doesn't clash with the main dish. Also it was a bit dry even though I used more melted butter on top than what is called for. My husband however really liked it (hence the four stars). But when I make it again I think I'll increase the sour cream and/or creamed cheese a bit and maybe also add some shredded cheddar either in the mixture itself or on top. Hopefully that will help boost the flavor a bit.",
