                "reviewBody": "Hubs hurt my feelings tonight. In between mouthfuls of chili he said, \"This is the best chili you've ever made.\" Hmf! MY chili, I thought, was the best!  I made a few changes, all of them minor, but the one big change I HAD to make was to add more tomato sauce. I made 1/2 the recipe and, using the amount of tomatoes and tomato sauce called for, I had something that almost resembled the consistency of a casserole! So for this 1/2 recipe I had to add 4 more cups of tomato sauce (used my own, which I had put up from my garden). I would  call this quite a discrepancy! Even accepting that individual preferences dictate how thick or thin chili should be, until I \"fixed\" this it was something you could have eaten with a fork! I can't offer my own review of this, since I am not a fan of chili in the first place, so I would probably not like it no matter what. But hubs said he loved it, said it was \"4 star and darn near a 5.\" For the 1/2 recipe I used the full can of black beans rather than a half can - and I certainly wouldn't call it too \"beany.\" I used more fresh garlic than called for and left out the garlic powder. Finally, I had orange, yellow and red peppers on hand, so used them rather than the green pepper. I thought the addition of rosemary unusual - I could really taste it and didn't like it, personally. I don't think it belongs in chili. But hubs even had a second big bowl of this and instructed me, enthusiastically, to make it again. Looks like \"my\" chili is history.",

I followed the recipe as written w/ the exception of browning the meat w/ the onions bell peppers and 3 minced garlic cloves. Also the consistency in the crock pot was like mega-chunky-pasta-sauce so I upgraded the 8 oz. can tomato sauce to a 15 oz. as well as an additional 1/2 can of water. I couldn't help but omit the rosemary though I'm sorry Kas but I couldn't bring myself to put rosemary in chili. Otherwise all the other spices and herbs remained in the ratio written. Served our's w/ additional cilantro green onion cheese and fritos but everyone at the table was grabbing for Sriracha Texas Pete and jalapenos to add some oomph. I think this chili's leftovers would be good for festooning a baked potato or a hot dog and I think I'd be happy to make it again.",
