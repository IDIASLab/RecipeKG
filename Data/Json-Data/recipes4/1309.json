I cut the tenderloin up into thin slices and put them in 2 - 1 gallon plastic bags and pounded them with a hammer. I had to fry the steaks in batches since I had more pieces. (BTW...1 cup of flour was more than enough to coat all of the pieces and I ended up throwing a lot away). Didn't use ground bay leaves because we didn't have any and did not substitute it with anything else. Used canola oil instead of olive because I was out of olive oil. Used about 1 1/2 tbsp. of fresh chopped garlic because we love it. Used 6 brown (also known as cremini or baby portabellas) mushrooms because we don't eat white domestic and I wish we had used more because personally I would have liked mushrooms in every bite. They tasted really good in this recipe. Thanks for the recipe. It's a nice change from the usual fried steak with cream gravy. I'll use it for beef and I'm sure it will taste even better! Also the gravy was delicious with egg noodles instead of potatoes!",

I made mine with cube steaks (although I would be interested to try it with venison someday if the \"boys\" went out hunting, or I was feeling extravagant enough to buy some.) I was a little leary of using canned gravy, but didn't have the time to add the extra step of making my own. However, the richness of the onion and mushroom gave it a very authentic flavor, you could still taste the \"canniness\" but not very much. I also would recommend to anyone trying this with cube steaks, simmer it for more like 2 hours as mine was still pretty tough after 1 hour. I'm planning on trying it in my slow cooker the next time I make it, and using canned consumme to make the gravy. All in all, an excellent dinner, I wouldn't serve it to company because it's not the prettiest presentation in the world, but around the table over a pile of mashed potatoes it really satisfied.",

Normally I love the flavor cooking with wine gives a meal, in this case, I dont know if cooking with tabasco could have given this dish flavor.  I had some of the most incredible venison backstrap and unfortunately chose to cook it with this recipe.  20 minutes later I had a big pot of blannnnnndddddd, chewy, ruined meat, it honestly tasted worse than chuck.  What is funny is I had a few pieces that didnt fit into the pan so I just tossed them on another one for a minute a side with some steak seasoning and they were incredible.  Should have done that to all of them instead of wasting the last of my backstrap.  Sorry but I would have give this a zero stars if possible",
