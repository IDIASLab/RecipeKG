Instead of chili paste (because I can never find it) I use tomatoe paste and I add all the sauces until it tastes right to me.  If it looks dry, I add chicken or beef broth.  We love to mix the left overs with the rice and put in the fridge for the next day.  Tastes even better the next day for lunch!  Great recipe, thanks!",

I used just red pepper and I added shredded carrots, broccoli, and cabbage. I think mushrooms would be good as well. Overall, very versatile recipe.",

The ginger plays a key role in the dish, and it compliments the hot of the red pepper, and the tang of the garlic perfectly.  I didn't use red bells, because of the cost in my area(at $2.99a pound, you'd probably agree), but the green pepper was perfect, nontheless.  I did have to make my own chile paste using tomato paste, hot sauce, chile owder, and paprika, but the effect was the same.  Everyone gobbledit up, and my friend, an aspiring chef, told me that he would make this at home, quite the compliment.  Thank you for such a great way to use ordinary ground beef!!",
