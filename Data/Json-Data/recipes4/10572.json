                "reviewBody": "I used roasted chestnuts I ran through the food processor as there is no puree sold here (and the chestnuts are a seasonal item so I may be making this only a few more times). First of all I measured everything out carefully and the dough was way too wet. I ended up adding almost another cup of all purpose flour just to keep the dough from sticking to my gloved hands and the pastry mat. As a result the dash of pepper and nutmeg got lost as I tasted neither. The roasted chestnuts added very little moisture so I'm not sure why the dough was so wet. The flavor of the pasta was nice however the texture was not like an al dente pasta but was instead pasty. Since the whole roasted chestnuts had a texture of a cooked kidney bean maybe this added too much starchiness to the pasta. I will be making this again as I like the taste. I'm going to try playing around with the amounts and types of flour.",
