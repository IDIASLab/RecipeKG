This recipe looks pretty authentic. You can also take out the chicken/meat and add more vegetables (broccoli carrots peas eggplant etc..) and make it vegetarian. You can sneak in the veggies by pureeing them picky eaters (for example some little ones) won't know the difference. After you bake it cut it into squares. The left-over squares can be reheated or eaten cold right out of the fridge. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!",

I think next time I would add parsley instead for more flavor. I cheated and used the pre-packaged hash browns and it worked nicely. You could also substitute lamb for the chicken. Reminds me of my sister-in-law's cooking and my wonderful visits to Tunisia. thanks for the great recipe; hubby loved it. Had bought carrots and peas so used that instead; pretty color.",

I would give my finished tajin a 5 star rating but I didn't exactly follow this recipe. I used this concoction as a base and then took ideas from time in my Tunisian friends' kitchens. What I made was LOVED by many different families of Tunisian friends -- \"oh Allyssa benina y'sr bilhuq!\" (\"Oh Allyssa very delicious really!\") Here's what I changed: - about 2.5 tsp ras el hanout - added about 0.5 tsp tumeric - put in no harissa - no water - no tomato sauce - no peas - added about 1.5 times the spinach - added more than a pinch of salt. I followed the direction as given but ended up mixing the potatoes back into the chicken and spinach mixture. It was all nice and moist. This is where I tasted and added some more salt and ras el hanout. Just before baking I added a few table wedges of \"laughing cow\" style cheese as I'd seen friend do in the past. I will definitely make this modified version again!",
