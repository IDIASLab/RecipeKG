Doubled the cumin (LOVE the stuff) and added some Penzey's Bold Taco seasoning to the mix.  This was great!  Plenty of left-overs went in the freezer.

I used all organic canned products when I could I added one can organic drained/rinsed black beans and one can organic diced tomatoes. I like more garlic so I threw more in. I did not add the extra salt. This was good but I think it needs a little somethin'-somethin'. A little lime juice? Cilantro? I can't put my finger on it. As it is nice and easy adaptable soup to throw in what you like that saves both on the food and energy budgets. NOTE: This made enough for 6 smallish Tupperware containers for dinner at work this week.",
