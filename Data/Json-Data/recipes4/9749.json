We loved the ease of the recipe. TALK ABOUT A QUICKIE.\n\nMy changes:\n\nNIX the turmeric - it made the soup sooo bright yellow! \n\nI almost doubled the lime juice.   I put in the required amount and then floated a few thick lime slices on top while it simmered.  I removed those before serving it.\n\nI probably doubled the Cilantro.  I put some in while it simmered, and put more in just before serving.  \n\nInstead of water I used low sodium/low fat chicken broth to round out the flavor.  \n\nI added just enough Splenda Sweetner to \u201csweeten it up\u201d just a little .  I\u2019ve had this soup served both ways ( slightly sweet, and no sugar at all).   We prefer it slightly sweet.  \"Sweet\" just ROCKS the flavor of the lime!  I have never found Lemon Grass locally, so I quit worrying about it.  The soup was EXCELLENT and almost a DIRECT HIT for what we have eaten in upper end Thai restaurants. \n\nDo yourself a favor...and DO NOT SMELL THE FISH SAUCE.  It's PUTRID AND  DISGUSTING!  However...once mixed with the other ingredients something magical happens and it was beyond wonderful when all the flavors commingled!  \n\nI like to put a small scoop of white rice into a bowl and add the soup over that.   \n\nNext time I make it I'm going to try using 1/2 lemon juice -1/2 lime juice.\nWill definitely make this again for company!",

Traditionally, 'Tom Kah' soup is predominantly flavored with three essential ingredients, namely galanga, lemongrass, and kaffir lime leaves, in which this recipe lacks. For a vegetarian soup simply substitute chicken with oyster mushroom. Galanga, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves add flavour to the soup and are pretty to look at in the bowl, but they are inedible. I often remove these ingredients by straining, then cook the meat or mushroom in the soup.",

Also try to stir continuously.  I added thai chili sauce instead of cayenne, canned straw mushrooms, a pinch of sugar, low sodium chicken broth instead of water, 2 tbs of soy sauce with fish sauce, lime slices.  I did not mince the ginger I cut it in visible slices so that you could pick them out.  I did not use turmeric.  It tasted just like the tom ka at my favorite Thai place.  With a brand new baby it's hard to go out to eat so I am so glad that I could recreate this soup at home with the help of this recipe!  ",

So suggest to add lime juice after you remove the soup from the heat.  Adding lime juice during boiling, making it has bitter taste.  This is Thai's trick.  This method is applied for Tom yam as well.  For authentic Tom Kah Kai version, we don't need to sautee the chicken in the oil too.  And most important thing for this dish, don't make the coconut curd.",
