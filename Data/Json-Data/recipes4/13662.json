Veggie soup has to have tomatoes so I used Rotel tomatoes with green chilies (undrained) and a can of tomato sauce for the tomato soup. Very salty so next time I will use reduced salt products. Be sure to break your spaghetti noodles small or you will slurp sauce all over your face. Will make again with maybe elbow noodles.",
