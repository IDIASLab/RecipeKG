I guess it takes 3-4 years after a recipe is submitted.  I have an updated version on my profile page called Big Bird Chili which uses ground turkey -- 3# instead of 2#, and I've increased the amount of jalapenos since the ones available now aren't as hot as they used to be.  One reviewer here used ground bison, and that would be excellent; I've used elk with fantastic results and any wild game would be superb as well.  PS I wasn't going to rate my own recipe but the site requires it so I did... I like my turkey version better & no longer buy commercially raised beef so I'll give myself 4 stars, OK? :)",
