Put them under the broiler to melt the cheese and dig in! Thanks for this recipe!",

As far as the mayo I think most people would have better luck if they made it to their own preference. I just took a few spoonfuls of mayo (enough for me my bf and daughter) and then added about 2 chipotles and some sauce and tasted and then added until I had the flavor I liked. My bf LOVED the mayo. If you just take enough mayo to serve the number of people eating and then add a little of the peppers and sauce at a time you will be a lot happier. Too much chipotle can be really hot. I cannot wait to make this again.",

I've since been conscripted to make this for her Bunko night and another time we had the neighbors over for dinner (mind you this is within 2 weeks). I've found that you can substitued a London Broil if you can't find flank steak and also that there is enough marinade that two pieces of meat can be prepared at one time. As one reviewer noted a cup and a half of mayo is quite a bit of mayo but my family liked it enough that they found other uses for it and it didn't go to waste. Do remember not to overcook the meat because these cuts will tend to get tough quickly so if you like well done this may not be the recipe for your and also cut the meat on a bias and across the grain and you'll have an excellent meal... I've had nothing but rave reviews to date and this recipe is getting a workout.",

For the Chipotle Mayo I didn t have any chipotle peppers in adobo sauce NO PROBLEM! I used can green chilies 1 tablespoon pimentos a couple shakes of Habanera Pepper sauce plus capful of liquid smoke then pureed together in a small food processor and it made a nice pinkish sauce with green specks (2 servings). Used it not only for the steak I added it to a baked potato and used left-over s to make sandwiches with. Then made another batch and add EVOO to it to make a nice creamy salad dressing. The steak came out great but my husband said the mayo was better than the steak. I served the steak with a baked potato and green salad with olive oil/vinegar/garlic vinaigrette.",

Boy was I pleasantly surprised when I took my first bite. It was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except for two things. I didn't have any fresh rosemary so I used dry instead. I can see how this would be so much better with fresh rosemary but my plants aren't that far along yet. Also I didn't have any canned chipotle peppers so I used some chipotle hot sauce instead. I just mixed it with the mayo until it had the right bite I was looking for. So so good! My husband loved it too!",
