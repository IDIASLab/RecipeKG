Served it with Spanish rice. The chili's used in the recipe are not especially hot and work very well to make this an extremely savory dish.  If you prefer a hotter dish, I would recommend using a hot chorizo sausage as opposed to a mild one.",

It only takes 20-30 seconds on each side, but be careful not to burn them.  I also toast and grind whole cumin seeds to add to the sauce.  You can spice it up a bit too with a variety of chilis.  Add a dried chipotle chili to the mix for a smokier and more spicy sauce.  Chilis by themselves might tend to make a sauce that's somewhat bitter.  You can temper that by adding a small can of tomato sauce if you like.",

As a previous post said it has that \"dusky\" flavor, earthy, which is what separates real mexican food from a chalupa from taco bell.  The dried peppers are the key.  One thing I will say is make sure you really grind the peppers finely in your food processor for several minutes.  I don't think I did this enough and was left with lots of little pieces of the dried pepper skin in the sauce, which are tough and fibrous, like having slivers of crab cartalige in your crabcakes if you don't pick over the meat enough.  Also add your salt at the end to avoid oversalting if your chorizo is salty.  I took the advice of other posts and added one chipotle pepper for heat.  Really this was a great sauce as far a flavor goes.  I boned and shredded the chicken back into the sauce then served it wrapped in warm flour tortillas.  Thanks for the recipe!",
