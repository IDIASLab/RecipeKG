I read many of the reviews and consequently pre-cooked the zucchini w/about a 1/4\" water in the microwave. I tried to squeeze the water from the removed pulp (tough to do especially in a hurry) by squishing it against a strainer with paper towels. The I poured on the filling ingredients (really any tasty combination will work as long as it disguises the squash flavor/texture!). The items in the recipe work fine but if I ever venture into squash territory again I'd opt for stronger add-in flavors - Mexican (chorizo & cheese) Italian (hearty marinara & strong parmesean) or maybe more Mediterranean - assorted olives sauteed mushroom blend feta or chevre. The most important thing is to find a way to keep these boats from getting soggy. One reviewer recommended broiling the cut/scooped halves w/ a bit of EVOO - I think this would give a crispier canoe to fill than the microwave technique in water. I salute those of you who enjoy squash stuff; I encourage the rest of you to try this - a good and flavorful way to ease yourself into this vegetable group!",

I also left out the bacon so that it was a vegetarian dish. I used red onion and added two cloves of freshly minced garlic. Like other reviewers I just used breadcrumbs instead of bread. Lastly I used a little cheddar cheese but mostly I put in feta which was very good. I did cook mine on the grill and used another reviewers suggestion of making open \"boats\" instead of enclosing the zucchini in the foil. It was not mushy at all this way. I'll definitely make this again! It could easily be baked in the oven so this is going to become a year round side dish in my family:)",
