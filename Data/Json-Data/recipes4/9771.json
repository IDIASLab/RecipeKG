Next time we want to get stick pepperoni to have bigger bits in the soup. Another addition we tried was adding another cup of water and a cup of orzo we liked the texture the pasta added. The flavor was pretty good it does need a boost maybe more italian seasoning next time too. We'll have it again though - it was easy & quick as well that always helps on busy work nights:) UPDATE I made this again using 1tbsp italian seasoning and cutting up a 5oz stick of pepperoni into chuncks and it made the world of difference - we all really loved it - it disappeared this time lol:)",

I changed the water for beef stock added garlic SALT (which I find it needs) salt black pepper about a tbsp of the italian seasoning & extra oregano & basil ( 1tbsp of oregano & 1tsp. of basil). I assume the lack of salt is (I didn't have the sausage) because the sausage provides it. I had pepperoni cubes (1\"x1\" thick) frozen for making pizza pockets but they ended up in the soup. The hubs prefers the peppers crunchy so I'll add them before he goes to work so that they cook a bit when he reheats it there. Not bad just a bit more is needed & you have it all in your spice rack.",
