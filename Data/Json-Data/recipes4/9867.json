I skip the initial heating of oil and tomato paste step - I found it unnecessary - I simply whisk the oil and tomato paste together in a small bowl and add to the beans and stir - it blends better that way. My husband is managing his diabetes with diet herbs and exercise - green beans are one of the nonstarchy vegetables he can eat consequently this was a welcome addition to our diabetic recipe collection.",
