Not sure if my sauerkraut was Bavarian it's sauerkraut I get from the refrigerated section in a bag. The sauerkraut tang was there but just toned down enough that it's not all you think of. I used beef base instead of chicken. I was generous with the raisins and they did not taste like raisins when the dish was done just delicious so don't leave them out:) Servings are very generous. Now I am wondering what subbing some beer for the water would taste like...? Thanks for the fabulous recipe!",
