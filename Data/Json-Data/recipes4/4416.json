This smells AMAZING, a lot like the salsa chicken I make on a regular basis. I can only assume we'll love it just like we do salsa chicken. I plan on spooning the sauce over mexican rice and I've made homemade refried beans to go with it. Can't WAIT for dinner. NOTE: I was able to make this in my \"Lil' Dipper\" crockpot which saved me on counter space and it cooked it perfectly. Cutting the breasts each in half filled up the crockpot 3/4's of the way through so I didn't need to worry about burning my ingredients.",

I put the chicken in the crock pot, then poured the beans around it, then layered the remaining ingredients, as instructed. I cooked it on low for a little over 4 hours. It smelled wonderful when I got home! When I took the lid off, I was a little worried that it wasn't going to work well for taco filling (in soft corn tortillas) because it looked a little watery, but when I used the forks to shred the chicken, it absorbed the excess liquid. It made for excellent tacos! Thank you for sharing!",

I used dehydrated onions and garlic and used!/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead of chili powder. I found out my cayenne pepper is really really hot and that is why I used only half the amount.

My crock pot doesn't have a low + 4 or 5 hr option, (it has a \"high 4 or 6 hour\" setting,) so I set it at \"low 8 hrs\", and took it out after 4.5 hours.  I live at a high altitude (7000ft+), so things usually take a little longer to cook, but I guess this didn't need extra time. The chicken tasted a little dry and overall it was a bit too spicy for my tastes, so next time I think I'll try cooking it for 4 hrs and try putting in only 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  I ate mine on a tortilla with cheddar cheese and some sour cream.  I think it would taste good on a tortilla with plain white rice (that the sauce leftover in the crock pot would flavor) and maybe some bell peppers.",
