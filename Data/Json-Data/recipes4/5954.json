I couldn't find the size container of biscuits listed, so I used 1 container of Grands flaky layer biscuits, pulled each in half and used one half per muffin cup (got 16 out of the recipe), and that worked perfectly b/c that was just about how many I needed! I used my blender to blend the eggs w/ the milk, also adding in some salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. I blended that for about 30 seconds, and proceeded w/ the recipe. I did 1/2 w/ the bacon and cheese and 1/2 w/ just cheese b/c my dad doesn't like bacon (crazy, I know!). I topped them w/ a lttle parsley before baking, just for some added color. These smelled heavenly while baking and were the hit of Christmas morning breakfast! I can't wait to try different flavor combos...this recipe is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Also, we made corn meal gravy and regular sausage as a side (because someone wanted to doubt the turkey gravy). When it came out we poured the gravy on top and OHHHHHH. we ran out of gravy FAST! Perfect with the biscuits. We did have alot of leftover eggs mix. Next time Ill use half the amount. all in all though it was great. Will be having frequently now.",

Mine looked nothing like the photo. They puffed out like muffins. I baked for 3 minutes less than recipe called for because they seemed well set. I think I could have taken them out even a minute sooner because the biscuits were a little tough. I split the biscuits in half and used one half per muffin cup leaving me with 2 extra biscuits. I also had some egg mixture left over. I used more meat and cheese than the recipe called for and that could be why I had egg left over. But I liked the amount of meat to egg ratio I had. I made half bacon onion cheese and half ham onion cheese. They were ok and nice for a buffet brunch but I think the recipe needs tweaking. Maybe some sharper cheese or something to liven it up. Overall a decent start and would be a hit for meals where you want something that would please adults and kids. I try this again making my own biscuit dough and experiment with fillings.",
