Both uncooked chicken and frozen broccoli release a lot of water when cooked. Hence most of the reviewers problems. As for the bland taste I sprinkled garlic powder I did not use basil. (sorry basil is better in Italian dishes)I grated monterey jack that had jalapeno in it and sprinkled a mix of monterey and cheddar cheese as well. The grocery store sells this mix in one bag. I also added some uncooked minute rice for it will cook due to the soup in it. I cooked it at 400 degrees and watched it to see if I was going to need to add any more milk. The way I did this turned out incredible and was not watery in the least.",
