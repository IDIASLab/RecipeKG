So I sifted the two together with salt sugar and baking powder to create self-rising flour. Also I had on hand Urad flour which is black bean flour. I went ahead and mixed everything together and into the oil it went. The fritters came out golden light spongy and so flavorful. Add mango chutney to that and what a wonderful treat!
