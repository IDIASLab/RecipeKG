I chose to use white balsamic vinegar rather than the dark because I prefer it. I began making this and then realized I didn't have any tomato paste so I used some tomato sauce with basil garlic and oregano in it and thickened it with just a little flour. Also I was apprehensive but added the tablespoon of salt to the zucchini. But I could not add any more salt to the meat as it cooked. I'm glad I didn't. It was seasoned just fine. One thing I love about this recipe is that the pan it cooks in goes from stove top to oven. Not a lot of dirty dishes to clean up.",

                "reviewBody": "My family loves zoodles and this is a fantastic recipe! I made a few adjustments that I think made it even yummier and perhaps a bit more nutritious. I saut\u00e9ed one chopped onion and one chopped green pepper in olive oil and minced garlic before adding the turkey for browning. I significantly reduced the onion powder and garlic powder and omitted the garlic salt altogether. I didn't add more oil or garlic when I added the diced tomatoes and tomato paste. The sauce was looking a little dry for my taste probably because of the added onion and pepper so I added a second can of diced tomatoes. After simmering the meat mixture with the tomatoes tomato paste and spices for 7-10 minutes I added a cup or so of chopped mushrooms. When the mushrooms were tender I removed the pot from the heat and stirred in a couple of large handfuls of a bagged spinach/kale mix I had on hand. Once the leaves wilted a bit it was time to add the zoodles and proceed as the recipe directed. Because I used a dutch oven rather than a skillet I put everything in a lasagna pan before adding the cottage cheese and mozzarella but I'll definitely try this as a \"one dish\" meal in the future. I haven't had such an enthusiastic response to a new recipe in a while; this is a healthy meal that will be repeated many times at our house!",

Omitted the garlic salt I thought the garlic powder and minced garlic was enough. I don't have an oven proof skillet so I used a regular skillet and transferred it into a 13 x 9 baking pan lined with foil when it was time for baking.
