It plays a huge part in the flavour.  I would add 1 cinnamon stick rather then the powder but both work well.  Also a whole can of Chipotle\u00b4s would be very hot I would reccomend using 2-3 chipotles and also adding 1 tablespoon of sugar",

It was also SUPER easy that way - no boiling and the chicken basically falls apart after 8 hours on low so shredding is piece of cake. (I put the chicken breasts in the crock pot with the sauteed onions & garlic; then I blended the tomatoes & peppers and put those in there as well to cook all day.) The first time I made this I used WAY too many peppers (I was trying to do a half batch) and we couldn't even eat it. But the second time we got the spice level right for us and it was a hit - about one whole chipotle pepper per tomato. We also like to put black beans on the tostada with it. Very unique authentic flavor!",

Using 6 breasts will give you PLENTY of food... easily enough for 8 adults and handful of toddlers.

If you don't know this healthy trick already, a great, healthy substitute for sour cream is plain yogurt... mmmm... full fat is the best.  You can substitute it in for all your sour cream needs.",

                "reviewBody": "Great recipe it's authentic! Here's a tip for managing the spiciness of this dish (especially when some of your family doesn't do spicy and some like it HOT): Instead of blending the whole can of chipotles into the sauce only blend in maybe one (you can never tell just how hot a given can will be). Then pull a few whole peppers out of the can and add them to the final mixture. Let them simmer in there to get that delicious smoky flavor but avoid breaking them up since the spiciness will mix into every bite if they are in pieces and the seeds get out. Finally blend the remainder of your can into a paste that each person can smear onto his or her tostada according to spiciness preferences. Also - don't worry about your tomatoes being too juicy. This dish should be a little watery (a little juice will slide off the tostada); if it's really really too watery then a) serve it with a slotted spoon or b) let it simmer down for a while and it will thicken just like spaghetti sauce does. Goes great with Agua de Jamaica (an easy and delicious hibiscus tea).",

I used fajita sized flour tortillas instead of tostadas. Fresh slices of avocadoes would be delicious wrapped with the chicken. I served these with cheese and jalepeno mashed potatoes.",
