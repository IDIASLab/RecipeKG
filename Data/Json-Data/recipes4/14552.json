It passed muster with my husband who doesn't like anything and my son who doesn't eat anything, so it's a winner in my house. Very good with French bread! I recommend spicy or at least medium sausage.",

My sausage was a tomato cheese sausage I removed from a casing and sauteed with onions and the mushrooms called for. I didn't know what I was doing bit I didn't drain the grease I drained the extra water in the bottom of my squash baking dish and barely left enough to cover the bottom when I added the butter (when baking the first 30min had about 1/4\" level). The rice made SO MUCH MORE than needed so hopefully the pouch will be sufficient when you make this. I topped with mozzarella cheese rather than adding into the rice mixture and didn't add pecans (personal preference). I went back for more. So surprised at how delicious it is. And I was never a squash person growing up and I went back for seconds.",

I live in Switzerland where (oddly enough) you can't buy ground sausage. So I made this with plain ground pork (mixed with the coriander as the recipe states) and mine turned out very bland. Perhaps it would be better if made with a flavored sausage. Also the squash took much longer to cook than just 1/2 hour. My squash halves took one hour to cook until tender before I stuffed them and then cooked the extra 30 minutes. And the squash is still not extremely tender the way I like it to be. Will not be making this again.",
