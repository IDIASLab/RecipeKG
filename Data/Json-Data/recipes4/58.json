Before frying coat in seasoned flour mixture (white flour, seasoning salt, black pepper and paprika, this will ensure a nice crispy coating and no crumbling.

Also usually use salt cod -- which is freshened by either soaking it overnight (changing water several times) or boiling and then rinsing and flaking the fish 3 - 4 times.  (I've recently taken to just purchasing frozen cod filets which I boil up once and then flake for use in the recipe!)\n\nWe add more herbs and spices (thyme, oregano, garlic powder, curry powder, paprika) and hot peppers (diced haba\u00f1eros) or sauce (Louisiana-style) to taste.  Flour, baking powder, and an egg are also added, along with enough water to make a thick batter, which is dropped into hot oil and fried.  (I prefer to use a deep fat fryer so that the cakes have a crisp outer seal yet remain tender inside.)",

I STRONGLY agree with anyone who has said that 2 cups of oil is too much. Absolutly. For the half recipe I probably used 1/3 of a cup and it was fine and probably spared me a heart attack or two. I had a little problem when I mixed it all together- it was too wet and not firm enough to mold. However it was easily solved by adding some fine breadcrumbs. After that popping them into little patty form was not an issue. The texture was great though next time I think I'll go for something a little chunkier. They ended up crispy and yummmmy!

I think they still need a little extra something for more flavor (hmmm maybe roasted red pepper sauce?) but all in all it was a fantastic meal I will definitely make again.
