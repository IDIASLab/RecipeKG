You can actually reduce the recipe by half (but keep 2 lbs of beef) and put the tips into a zippered freezer bag.  Then you can make a whole bunch and freeze what you're not ready to cook yet.  Also, the type of salad dressing and barbecue sauce make a big difference!  Try with your favorite brands first, and then go from there.  I've found some salad dressings to be too salty.  Finally, add 1 tsp of meat tenderizer to shorten the marinade time and make the beef deliciously tender.",

I didn't have garlic pepper seasoning so I used minced garlic and a couple dashes of Montreal Steak seasoning. I poked the steak a few times with a fork and placed everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate all day. I turned it a few times during the marinating process. I definitely recommend marinating longer than an hour for optimum results.",

So, I typed in Sirloin Broil in the ingredient browser and read through the recipes. I came across this one and oh my goodness I am so glad I did!! Simple ingredients worked magic on the steaks. I lessened the amount of ingredients used only because the steaks I had weren't very big. I threw the marinade in a ziptop bag as well as a touch of meat tenderizer because I wasn't sure what cut of meat I was working with, tossed in my steaks, squished it all around, and set it in the fridge. When I got home from work 8 hours later, took the steaks out of the fridge, let it rest on the counter for about a half hour to come to room temperature and threw 'em on the grill. This recipe is outstanding, and it will be a favorite in my household!! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe :)",
