I mixed up the beef, put half of it in the freezer, and made 12 burgers today.  I took the suggestion of one reviewer and put down a layer of finely chopped onions beneath the big burger patty (would recommend you try this) because that\u2019s how they\u2019re cooked on the grill (no beef broth as was suggested), used a straw to poke ventilation holes in the big patty, and cut them to fit the bun with a pizza cutter.  The one thing that was omitted from this recipe was a dill pickle slice for each burger, it's important;  as I recall, that\u2019s something they always had.  The only thing that would bring this recipe closer to the real deal (other than having that little cardboard box), is to steam the buns, they need to be softer, and I will try that  the next time.  Had some burgers left today which I wrapped up individually in plastic wrap,  then into the freezer to be reheated at a low temp in the microwave.  Please, no American cheese or Dusseldorf mustard, just a plain White Castle\u00ae, the way they always were sold (and yes, I remember when they were 12-15\u00a2).  Gotta tell ya, an indulgence for sure, but I totally enjoyed this, it was like a  \" blast from the past!\"  ***UPDATE 6.2.18:  Today, I  steamed the  finished burger, and OMG, now they\u2019re the real deal!",

We didn't have pickle slices but relish works just as well. We sliced it w/ a pizza slicer. Yeahhhh boiii.",

My friends were surprised to find out I hadn't gotten them at the drive through. That first time I followed the recipe precisely. Changing it too much defeats the purpose anyway, right? The next time  I used ground sirloin instead of chuck to reduce the fat, and nicer rolls.\n\nDo use a larger cookie sheet than called for, and roll the meat all the way to the edges.  If it sticks to the side a little it will reduce shrinkage.  Also, if you can slice the rolls all in one piece, you can put on a slab of meat and top it all with cheese at once. Cutting the rolls apart afterward is easier than making two dozen individual burgers.",

                "reviewBody": "@ TWITCH RADIO: The information in your comment comment is completely incorrect. White Castle was the first fast-food hamburger system ever developed, starting in 1921 by Billy Ingram and Walter Anderson. Krystal restaurants didn't start until 1932, over 10 years after White Castle, the basic idea being copied from the White Castle system after a visit to a White Castle location by Rody Davenport, Jr., and J. Glenn Sherrill, the founders of Krystal. The two systems are only similar in the certain appearance aspects of the finished hamburger. The cooking methods are entirely different, being that the White Castle hamburger patty is steam cooked on a bed of onions and water, and is never flipped; while the Krystal is fried and flipped halfway through the cooking process. White Castle is THE FIRST AND ORIGINAL fast-food system. The two companies are completely unrelated. May I suggest that you please get your fact straight before you publish erroneous, potentially scurrilous information here that only propagates rumors and muddies the waters for folks who don't know the true story. It is irresponsible comments like yours that further untrue stories about the quality and of fast-food restaurants and other businesses.",

I cooked it on non-stick Reynolds wrap. Cooking took maybe 15 minutes at 400 with less mess than trying to cook them stovetop. After draining & scraping off the 'goo' I just added cheese on top popped them in the microwave to melt the cheese & placed them on buttered toast with melted shredded mozzarella cheese on the toast as I had no buns but it was still really good.
