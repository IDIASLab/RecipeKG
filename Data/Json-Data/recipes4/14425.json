I did adjust the recipe slightly, I did not have any parsley and used some basil instead also I added 2 cloves of garlic chopped and sauteed with the vegetables. (it is difficult to make a dish in our house without garlic ;) I also used Bisquick drop biscuits for the crust. It is great to find a new way to use the leftover rotisserie chicken, and the kids love it.",

Added them to the vegetables just before adding the flour, which I increased to 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons.\nI had no broth so I used chicken base and added it to 3 cups water- according to pkg. instructions.\nI had no 1/2 and 1/2, so I used a whole can of evaporated milk.\nThis mixture filled a 9x13\" Corning-ware baking dish and I still had room for the biscuits.\nI made my own drop biscuits:\nMix together:\n2 cups flour\n2 tsp. baking powder\n1/4 tsp baking soda\n1 tsp salt\nCut in:\n1/4 shortening\nStir in:\n1 cup buttermilk\nDrop over chicken mixture as stated and then bake at 400 for the 20-25 minutes.",
