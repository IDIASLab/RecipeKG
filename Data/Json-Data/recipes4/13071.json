I didn't have any celery in the house so I used cherry flavored Craisin's instead and I think I'll stick with that instead of the celery in the future because it really complimented the flavors of the apple and cherry jello nicely. The red hots never totally dissolved so I just fished out the bits that didn't melt. I used sugar-free Jello and fat-free cool whip to garnish making this a really yummy low-calorie snack. Thanks!",
