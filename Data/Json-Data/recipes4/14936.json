The flavor is excellent but there were some serious drawbacks. There is definitely a lot of prep work to chop all of the vegetables. If you have a food processor it would save a lot of time to use that to mince everything. I also had a really difficult time getting the patties to stick together. I ended up with 11 patties because the patties were huge if I just divided the recipe into eight. We started out putting them on the grill on tinfoil (because I was afraid they would crumble) but I ended up just transferring them to a pan and frying them in a bit of butter because they were sticking to the foil and falling apart. If I do try them again I will add another egg to the mixture make the patties even smaller and just pan fry them in a bit of olive oil.",

But then I spent the next 6 weeks or so eating them one by one from the freezer for lunch those days I stopped at home to eat between jobs. I've since made a second batch and am borrowing a blender this weekend to speed the chopping for a third batch! (Note: I tried a borrowed \"magic bullet\" smoothie maker to chop things for the second batch but it just turned them to mush. I'm hoping the lower power/speed on a real blender will do it right.) I don't sub any ingredients and despite not liking dill pickles (the only other \"dill\" thing I've tried) I love these. One other note regarding texture: they do tend to fall apart but I eat them with a fork rather than trying to keep them on a bun so it's all good. PS: After using AR for years (from time to time) I actually joined just now so I could review this recipe. Yes I love it that much!",

One tip also is that I recommend not using a grill and instead you can use a pan and a little olive oil (so if the patties break apart they won't fall into the abyss of the grill). This is just what I did and you can make it differently otherwise this is an amazing burger also great if you don't eat meat and or animal products.",

We were able to save some of them and we turned what was left into more of a hash on the stovetop. It tasted great!!! But it wasn't great enough for two hours of work and the disappointment of everything falling into the grill. Maybe it would have been better if I had just put them in a skillet from the beginning.
