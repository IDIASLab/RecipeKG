She of course made them without a recipe and I roughly tried to copy it down into a recipe and it came out pretty much like this. FYI there are two types of rye flour: course (or regular) rye flour and fine rye flour. Use the course flour for this since you'll be mixing wheat flour in with it. Also you'll end up putting about the same amount of wheat flour in as rye flour so you don't have to do it one tablespoon at a time you can almost double it at first and then add slowly until the texture is right. You can also add egg white to the butter to brush on top and you can also brush them again while they're oven if you want them super golden brown and soft but it's hardly necessary. For the rice try to use sushi or short grain rice but if you can't find it I think Thai Jasmine rice is the next best. Also these are best with whole milk and real butter. Finns usually serve these by spreading butter on top followed by some type of cheese (usually Edam). It's very common to eat them with ham and you can really put on whatever you want (tomato lettuce etc.). A lot of work but worth it!",

                "reviewBody": "Good recipe, and this review comes from a Finnish girl whose Grandma and Great-Grandma used to make these by the hundreds every morning to be sold at local farmer's markets. I think the eggbutter which Karjalan Pies (Karjalan Piirakka) are traditionally served with should be part of this recipe: 3-4  hardboiled eggs, peeled and chopped (use egg slicer...slice one way and turn the egg, and slice another way), combined with easily spreadable butter (\"I can't believe it's butter light\" works great), and some salt to taste. Gently mix together and spread on top of the warm  pies for a more authentic taste.\nAlso, don't worry too much about the shape when rolling the uncooked dough...kind of an oval/circle will do just fine. Run your hand (with a little flour in it) over the rolling pin after rolling out each pie (on floured surface), this will keep it from sticking. The thinner you roll the dough, the crispier the pies (substituting some regular bread flour will make the pies softer). \nPasta machine makes the rolling part faster if you are making a large batch, 50 or so. Typical Finns make these pies much larger in size than this recipe says, this amount would only make about 7-8 pies. \nI always use Calrose rice and wait until it's still easy to stir, but all the runny fluids are absorbed. Thanks, Sara!",

They are only worth the work if you are from Finland and need a taste of home or you have to make a Finnish recipe for school like we did. The combination of rice and rye (with egg butter) is yummy but could be just as good on nice toasted rye bread without all the work and mess.",
