Only thing I would watch...which I caught on the first attempt at this...check the rice after a while in the oven and you might have to 'lift' with a fork or spoon to have the sauce get down to the rice/bottom of baking dish. Even my hubby and son loved the cooked onions since they get so soft and add great flavor to the whole casserole!",

I added a red bell pepper for more color, plus the green bell pepper and instead of slicing it, I diced them into 1 inch pieces. I sauted them along with the onion rings, then using the same pan, seared each pork chop to hold in moisture. I added all the wet ingrediant's with eachother then poured over the rice. I then topped it with my sauted veggies, covered & cooked in the oven for 30 minutes before adding the pork chops. I left it uncovered & cooked for another 45 minutes. Turned out perfect and delicious. I will definately make this again.",
