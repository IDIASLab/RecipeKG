I always read other reviews before trying any recipe and took the advise of another to put the chicken on a slotted baking pan to keep it from getting soggy. I didn't have any tarragon or ginger, but the crust was very well seasoned even without it. The mustard gave it a nice bite. However I did cut back on the pepper as suggested. I did find that the recommended amount of oil was not sufficient though. The flour soaked up a lot more than what was called for. You won't be sorry that you made this one.",

I have some tips that work well: *lower the salt/pepper amount   *add 1- 1+1/2 tablespoon of garlic powder(best brand is Pride of Szegeo) I buy mine at The Butchers Shop or try a Deli. *set up EVERYTHING needed before hand and use tongs only to move chicken breasts, always grabbing at the same spot so the coating doesn't get messed up, if you have two tongs then even better-one for the egg mix & one for the flour mix +the flour tong  is used to also cook/remove meat from deep skillet & best pan to use  is cast iron   *used 1/2 - 3/4 cup of solid crisco * this also is great on scallopini-style meats of chicken, turkey, or pork -kind of like a thin schnitzel. * the resting periods are crucial to success as is using a rack- I used my huge cookie sheet  & put my large cake cooling rack on top, than laid down the meat.",

However, my husband and mother in law really liked it! I did cut down on the salt and pepper-actually cut both in half.  Next time I may try to bake the chicken breasts on some sort of rack-maybe they would not get soggy that way.  I liked the idea of baking due to the fact that most often chicken breasts dry out when you fry them-and I don't like dark meat!  I will try again with a few adjustments!  Pretty good recipe.  ",

This prevents the chicken from sitting in juices on the baking sheet so it's crispy all the way around.  Awesome recipe!  Oh, yea.  you can also leave out any spices you don't want/have if you'd like... it's still very good :)  First time I made it I didn't have ginger, dried mustard, or tarragon and it was still awesome.  Tonight I had the dried mustard and tarragon but still no ginger.  I think 20 minutes in the over was too much (my oven temp may just be off) so I'm going to try either turning down the oven a smidge or taking the chicken out a little early.
