I didn't have tarragon vinegar and used cider with fresh tarragon instead so maybe that could be why. I re-worked them a bit added wine vinegar some sea salt sugar and a few more spices; then heated the vinegar mixture just until things disolved nicely. I increased the ratio of vinegar to water. For our taste that was better. It's such an easy recipe that you can quickly make changes to suit your own taste!",

I mixed tarragon and cider vinegar as I didn't want to buy a whole bottle of special vinegar just for this recipe. I also couldn't find any fresh dill so used some dried even though I'm sure it's just not the same and a small amount of powdered mustard for the mustard seeds which I also can't find. I primarily taste garlic & vinegar with a kick from the peppers. I think these will be good for snacking or in bloody marys.",
