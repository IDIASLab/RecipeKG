So I only set the timer for 8 minutes but let the instant pot vent naturally (not quick vent) so the chicken was in the pot for a good 30-40 minutes total with building pressure cooking then venting & warming. The chicken so so moist and delicious. I will definitely be making this again. (Also I had some chicken broth to use up so I used that instead of water...not sure it would have made a difference either way. Next time I will try with just water.)",

It was lacking and missing something flavor wise, maybe the addition of a pickled slaw or fried onions would compliment this sandwich. The author of the recipe should specify which instant pot or pressure cooker they used as instructions would vary. I have a 6 quart Lux Mini Instant Pot which does not have a poultry setting so the instructions were not quite accurate for me. In such a case, omit the bottom rack, add 1/4 c water (or no water if using frozen chicken) add the chicken after sealing the lid select the manual setting on the instant pot and set the timer for 12-15 minutes. Perfect shreddable chicken. Then follow the recipe as instructed allowing the instant pot to manually realize pressure for 10-15 minutes and using almost all of the liquid created. Thank you for the recipe.",
