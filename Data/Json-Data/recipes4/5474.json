As such there wasn't enough room for all the spinach the recipe called for. I made it and it was awesome. 5 stars! After making this for a while I decided to get a real pie plate and make it again. The result... 4 stars. The spinach was a bit overpowering compared to the taste that I was now used to. The way I make it now is that I double the onions bacon mushroom broccoli and mixed in cheese. The result... 5 stars again.:) I also tried using non-baby spinach once and that was a mistake. Baby spinach is the way to go every time. Bon appetit!",

Instead added a heaping teaspoon of bacon grease to give this some bacon flavor and eliminated the 1/4 cup butter. Stirring the egg mixture into the vegetable mixture after it was placed into the pie shell seemed like an opportunity to damage the crust. Poured about 1/3 of the egg mixture into the vegetables and then spooned the combined mixture into the pie shell with the remaining egg mixture poured into the shell. The last ten minute baking time increment with the quiche foiled had to be extended an extra 6 minutes to get a clean toothpick. Will make this again soon as the hungry clan devoured this quiche in a flash.",

                "reviewBody": "I've made this twice now and have yet to fit it into one 9\" single pie crust. Today I made it without the vegetables and it still filled one crust to the rim. My recommendation is TWO DEEP-DISH crusts 10\" if you can get 'em and skip the broccoli. Use \"real\" bacon. One 9\" crust will hold THREE eggs 1/2 cup milk the onion & garlic and maybe--just maybe--some mushrooms without spilling over. The first time I made it I had fully half the eggs left over and that was with none of the bacon or broccoli. It will likely take me at least one more experiment to figure out exactly what WILL work--which says to me that the poster did not test the recipe with the instructions as written here.",
