It's terrific right out of the bread machine warm, but it taste just as good when it's cool! Makes wonderful grilled cheese and lunch box sandwiches! I've made this bread on a Monday, and I then store it in a plastic bag. We use it for sandwiches, toast, etc. It stays fresh for days. Of course, it's usually gone in a day or two at our house.",

I have made quite a few, in my bread machine, and this is my favorite so far. All the flavors balance well. It does have a tad sweetness, but it could be used as toast, meal bread, or even most sandwiches. I love how soft it is. I followed the recipe exactly, just using Gold Medal white whole wheat flour milled from a lighter color grain than traditional whole wheat. I also used the regular wheat setting on my machine as opposed to basic setting. On my machine the white and wheat settings are separate. I also don't have to set the lb size, or even the crust color, which is automatic. I couldn't understand why there were two measurements for water, but I just added them together when adding the water. This will be going in my bread machine recipe box. ty",

The kids love it even more than the potato fiber bread I sometimes buy.\n\nI pre-measure and mix 1 1/2 batches of dry ingredients (except yeast) and store in labeled 1/2 gal. mason jar.  Make 3-4 of these batches at a time and making fresh sandwich bread becomes even easier!\n\nI also found I can use olive oil (equal substitute) instead of butter (faster and healthier fat), and I use 1 T. of vital wheat gluten in place of 1 T. of wheat flour for each cup of wheat flour, which gives a great rise!  And for my larger batch (1 1/2  of this posted recipe), I don't increase the honey and it is still enough sweet.\n\nTip: Use a small marked measuring glass (like a tall shot glass), to measure & pour in the olive oil, THEN measure out the honey and it will release SO easily!\n\n1. Pour warm water, olive oil, honey, white wheat flour (my substitution again), bread flour, salt, and yeast, respectively, into the pan of a bread machine.  Run JUST the Dough cycle (1 1/2 hours).\n2. Lightly spray LONG (Wilton) sandwich loaf bread pan with non-stick spray.  Shape bread dough to fit pan, lightly cover with a towel and let raise in a warm place, 1 - 1 1/2 hr.\n3. Bake at 350\u00b0F for 26-28 min.  Turn bread out onto cooling grid to cool completely before slicing (I use a Hamilton Beach electric meat carving knife..",

All I could taste was honey (and I LOVE honey), I have no idea how others are not finding this sweet enough.  Both my husband and I agreed that, as written, it was basically a dessert bread.  I cut the honey down to 3 tbsp, which I find to be about perfect.\n\nAlso, it was rising and then falling significantly every time.  I'm not a chemist, so I've just been playing with things to try to fix this issue.  What's worked best so far is to cut the water down to just over a cup (I wasn't precise), and to cut the yeast down to 1 1/4 tsp.  It has been insanely humid here though, so it is possible that is impacting it.",
