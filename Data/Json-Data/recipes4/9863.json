I also but mine in the blender after it was all combined so that it was completly smooth and then finished heating. My family wanted more we will be having it again very soon.

First, instead of the water, I substituted a can of coconut milk.  Second,  I added a few tablespoons of rice vinegar. By necessity, I used cayenne pepper instead of jalapeno and omitted the basil (out of season).  Fourth, by choice, I upped the amount of fresh garlic and ginger (would definitely recommend this alteration).  I would note that this sauce only improves with time - after a week of sitting in the fridge, the sauce reheated perfectly and the taste was more well-rounded.  Would recommend.",
