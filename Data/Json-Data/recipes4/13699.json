                "reviewBody": "Ok, so I read the other reviews and can see where they might have not liked this dish, but this is an excellent dish to tweak and make amazing. For starters I cut back on some ingredients. I omitted the cayenne, cut the chunky peanut butter to 1 cup creamy, and cut the chili sauce to only 1 tablespoon. In place of the 2nd cup of peanut butter, I added 1/2 cup of peanuts (this will cut back on the peanut butter flavor and give it a little peanut crunch). I also changed the soy sauce to \u00bc cup and added a lot of garlic and onion powder to the sauce. I then added 1 tablespoon of fish sauce. In lieu of the 3 \u00bd cups water, I added 2 cups of chicken broth. I do not like chow mien noodles, so I kept those out all together. With these changes you will have a creamy (not too thick) sauce with an amazing flavor. Add directly and simmer it with the cooked chicken for about 5 to 10 minutes before tossing with the noodles. Right at serving, I highly suggest chopping up clean fresh cilantro and green onions and topping each plate. The cilantro gives it that extra Thai flavor. With these changes I swear it was very similar to my favorite Pei Wei Thai chicken dish.",

I added some additional sriracha and soy sauce then thinned the sauce with milk. Additional moves to create a thinner sauce could be welcome. If I made it again would also look to add some onion (vidalia probably) for additional texture and flavor (sweetness). Again a very good starting point but play around with it.",
