The Corned Beef does have a strong flavor when done so I would not recommend this to someone who likes their food with subtle flavor. One warning is it does not need more salt added. Part of the strong flavor does come from the salt already added to the corned beef. I would definitely make this again. Since this review I made the recipe many times. I also made it in the crock pot and it worked very well. I cooked it on low for 6 to 7 hours and when it had an hour left I added the potatoes and carrots.",

The meat was very tender and juicy and it smelled DELICIOUS as it was cooking though. If I can find a way to make it without it being so salty I would. Maybe corned beef brisket is just salty to begin with...I'm not sure because I've never made it before.",
