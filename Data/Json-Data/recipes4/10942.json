I used pretty much all the stated ingredients apart from the water but I browned the bite-size pieces of chicken in olive oil added the onion and sauteed it then stirred in the rest of the ingredients along with a can of chicken broth. I simmered it until the broccoli was tender - I needed to add a little more broth - and served it with plain white rice. Not bad at all. Thanks Rodney!",

                "reviewBody": "Used leftover rotisserie chicken. I picked the meat off. Then I put the carcass in broth made with ckn broth instead of water let it simmer about 30 min. for more flavor. I never throw out a ckn carcass. They come in so handy. Just wrap them up and throw them in the freezer til you are ready to use them. Took the carcass out. Added veggies. Carrots onions green beans & zucchini. Was out of broccoli. When they were tender I added chicken that was removed from the carcass before I put it in the broth. Next time I think I'll add a little rice or pasta. This is a great recipe for using up what's in your fridge. I also added some red pepper flakes. I always crush them in my hand. They blend in better that way and no one gets a mouthful. I always enjoy making a good soup. 2/19/2011 If you are worried about little ckn bones remaining in the soup wrap the carcass in cheesecloth & tie it tight & when soup is done remove the bag. It's a good precaution. Especially when the kids are slurping up the soup.",
