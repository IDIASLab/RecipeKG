I used the pumpkin and cream idea as a base and made a slightly thinner creamier sauce with sour cream and cream cheese instead of heavy cream. I also added olive oil kept the garlic plus added milk chicken stock Trader Joe's pumpkin butter crushed fennel cinnamon salt pepper and ginger to taste. The result was a creamy delicious sauce that was absolutely amazing with a rich pumpkin flavor. Ok so I tweaked the recipe a LOT but the pumpkin sauce base found here was my inspiration to build this great sauce. Served with a side of baked herb bread and a glass of Italian red wine - PRIMO!",

Also my sausage was sage flavored. I added a dollop of sour cream to the sauce along with parsley a little ground ginger some rosemary and a bit of sage. Turned out very good thanks for the recipe!

It's dry with just the pumpkin and the cream to make the sauce you can't taste the pumpkin and I'm definitely missing a chunky vegitable because of it. With the noodles and italian sausage it almost seems natural to add tomatoes and maybe a can of diced tomatoes is all it needs but I'd really like to see someone bring out the pumpkin flavor and create a better sauce. Until then I won't be using this recipe again! Good luck!!",

After I sauteed the sausage onion and garlic I added chicken stock for another layer of flavor....let it reduce before adding the cream and pumkin puree....I also added freshly grated nutmeg and chopped sage at the end as well as topped with freshly grated parmasean. My husband loved the flavor but thought it was still a little thick...would thin with pasta water last minute next time.",

This is similar to a Rachael Ray recipe and I kind of combined them both. I added 1/8 tsp clove 1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg (it is the secrete to the sauce...don't leave out nutmeg) and 1/4 tsp cinnamon. (I think I lessened the amount of ginger because of the additional spices.) I also added dried sage 2 tsp of it. (The sage with sausage and pumpkin is amazing.) I followed Rachael Ray's idea of adding chicken stock and white wine to loosen the sauce. (2 tbls of heavy cream just isn't enough liquid for this to be a creamy sauce.) It was super tasty and I'm surprised there were left overs the way my boyfriend was eating it. I will certainly make it again with my changes. (I only gave it 4 stars because I did make a lot of changes for it to be as good as it was.)",
