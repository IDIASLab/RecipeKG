The wine and cinnamon give it a different but pleasant taste.  I like to use a nice dry wine like a Zinfandel or Cabernet Sauvignon, then serve the rest with dinner!  Serve with crunchy bread and a green salad. Bon Appetit!",

I gave this 4 stars because we didn't like the cinnamon.  I had to start all over.  Things I did differently:  mince all veggies instead of chopping.  This makes a difference in the sauce and flavor blending.  You can use straight Italian sausage, but buy it in bulk instead of messing with casings.  The Butcher at the grocery can give it to you that way.  I always add a layer of Parmesan cheese in between the Ricotta mixture and the Mozzarella layer.  It does make it more cheesier, however, everyone seems to like it better that way.  I also doubled the Ricotta mixture as there wasn't enough to layer all the different layers.  I like my layers to extend throughout the dish, not just in the middle.  As for spices, I added about an extra teaspoon of Pizza seasonings, fresh ground in those little grinders you get at the grocery now.  This is about the best basic recipe on this site that I've found.  The sauce is the best, if you leave out the cinnamon.  You can also take the time to use fresh Roma tomatoes instead of canned for a more authentic flavor.  Canned tomatoes always have a metallic flavor to me.  Thank you!",

I made only half a recipe and froze the left overs. It is big if you do it all and I believe is meant for large dinner parties. As for the calories if you don't want calories what are you doing looking at Lasagna recipes? I liked the addition of all the vegetables. I did cut the sage because I wanted to sleep tonight and didn't want heartburn! The sausage gives it plenty of flavor. A good recipe if you want something different. Thanks for sharing.",
