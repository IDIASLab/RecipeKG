I am American but have lived in Poland for 11 years and this is how they do their \"malo solne\" which means low salt cukes. They are fantastic for digestion as they crate a bacteria that aids in proper digestion. But the above water to salt ratio seems high to me so I can see why some say it is too salty, they should not be too salty. Here we do 1 liter of water to 1 tablespoon of salt. We also put in the large dill flower, sliced of horseradish (if you like them a bit spicier) slice of garlic, peppercorns and various leaves from the following plants or trees: horseradish, tart cherry, black currant or oak. \nAlso you don't have to put the brine over when it is hot. You only do that if you are trying to speed up the process but I find they stay crispier if you let the brine cool.",

                "reviewBody": "An authentic recipe. super easy since fermenting is alot easier than pickling methods. These are actually lacto-fermented a process used for thousands of years.(sauerkraut kimchi deli pickles are lacto fermented) Any \"bad\"bacteria gets destroyed and the good lacto bacillus takes over and safely preserves food. Google \"lacto fermentation\" I made a few jars of these a few weeks ago (after 6 days I taste tested one were excellent then I moved jars to the fridge. I did think they were a little too garlicky but still the best I've had.) I made 36 quarts yesterday I added dill flowers dill sprigs garlic ( I only used half the garlic called for this time) a thin ring of hot red pepper five peppercorns in each jar. I lined the jar with a small Concord grape leave as this makes the pickles crisp like alum would. Oak leaves work too. I would have added a slice of horseradish root instead of hot pepper but my market had none this week. If you can find dill flower heads ( easier in spring and they dry easily) they are so pretty in the jar but you'll still need dill spigs for taste. Again this is a fermentation process so be patient! You may be tempted to add vinegar to this brine. DONT! It alters fermentation allows for bad bacteria to grow and you could ruin everything!! So NO VINEGAR. Be patient. If you want a quicker pickle use a vinegar pickling process. Very different. RENEMBER these will not taste like pickles for several d",

I'm wondering if it's because I scaled down the recipe and the ingredients are not supposed to be scaled down. I will try with 5 pounds of cucumbers next time. Make sure you are not using a plastic container for these but a glass or ceramic one as the recipe specifies; it does make a difference. If yours come out too salty like mine did here is how I saved them: Pour the liquid out and wash the cucumbers with running water (if too salty soak them in water for some time). Return them in the container with the spices. Boil 1 part vinegar with 1.5 part water and 1/4 part sugar. Pour the boiling liquid on top of the cucumbers seal and store in refrigerator. Good luck!",
