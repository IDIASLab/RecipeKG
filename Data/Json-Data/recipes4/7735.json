Because I am doing a Pantry Challenge, I happened to be out of \"fresh\" bacon so I used a partial bag of real bacon bits I had in my fridge. I also used up some leftover evaporated milk that I had in the fridge instead of regular milk. I made no other changes. After this came out of the oven, I served it with sour cream/homemade salsa on top and made it more filling with baked hashbrowns and buttered whole wheat toast. NO leftovers. I would make this again. Very tasty.",

I swapped out the green onion from some red onion(1/4 cup) and added a big handful of chopped mushrooms as well. Both which i sauteed quickly before adding to egg mixture. I also decided to fry the bacon up first(i used 9 slices)to render out the fat.Seems odd to me to add the bacon in just as is. I chose to bake mine in a 9inch pie plate, and it took a total of 33 minutes. Will be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!",

I cooked the bacon first to reduce some of the fat,  beat the eggs before adding the rest of the ingredients,  and added some fresh mushrooms.  The guys had seconds. I increased the quantities of everything and I'm glad I did,  I don't think it would have been enough.  I have a little left over, but that's better than not having enough. This could easily be prepared the night before and baked in the morning.  It would also be good for a quick and easy dinner.",
