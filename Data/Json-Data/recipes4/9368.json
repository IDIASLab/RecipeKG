Instead of 1/2 cup of water I used 1/2 cup of heavy cream. (I'd bought a pint and didn't want it to go to waste so I figured it couldn't hurt.) Then once the beaten whipped cream had been folded into the mixture I didn't think the frosting was fluffy enough for what I wanted. I also could still detect some grittiness from the pudding mix even though I beat it with an electric hand mixer for quite a while. So I took the remainder of my pint of whipping cream and beat that up and folded it in too. The texture came out exactly what I was looking for. It was easy to spread immediately. The texture is light and the flavor is chocolatey with just enough richness.",

                "reviewBody": "Simply \"dreamy\"... light fluffy creamy and satiny looking. Not too sweet with a pudding flavor. Delicious! Want to avoid the fat content in the recipe? Here's how you do it: Purchase fat-free condensed milk and in place of the heavy cream use one 12 fl. oz. can of fat-free evaporated milk. Omit the water in the recipe. Chill the evaporated milk in its own can (do not open it yet) to the point of it almost starting to freeze. Poor the chilled milk in a blender cup and whip until it triples in volume. Add it to the thick frosting base and mix slowly in a folding motion until well combined. Let it sit still for a few minutes to thicken before you start frosting your cake. Frosting made with evaporated milk will be very soft. Drop it by dollops on the top of your cake and near the top edges. It will slowly spread on its own and with your guidance it will smoothly slide down the sides of the cake forming a thick layer as it goes down on its own. If this type of consistency is a bit too thin to your liking put the frosting in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to 1 hour before you spread it on your cake. Chill frosted cake for several hours prior to serving so the frosting can set. The frosting has a nice satiny look which makes the cake look even yummier.",
