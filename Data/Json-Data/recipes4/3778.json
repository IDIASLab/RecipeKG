I used half the amount of pasta (basically half a box of penne).  I sauteed 1/2 cup of vidallia onion in 1 tbsp. of olive oil along with garlic. I used more than a tsp. and left out the bell pepper because I didn't have any on hand.  I used two 14.5 oz. cans of seasoned diced tomatoes and one 6 oz. can of tomatoe paste to give it some thickness.  I added some additional dried seasonings (basil, oregano, italian seasoning) to taste along with 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes.  I fried the sausage (crumbled out of the casing) separately and added that to the sauce to avoid any greasiness.  I let that simmer for about an hour and added the cup of heavy cream at the end and let that simmer on low.  I served this over the pasta, garnished with fresh parsley and topped with grated parmesan vs. adding the cheese to the sauce.",

After I had sweated the garlic, onions and peppers, I added the tomatoes and pureed them with a stick blender.  (My family likes a smoother sauce.)  Because I had blended the veggies, I browned the sausage in a seperate pan.  I surprised the heck out of my husband with this dish.  He is not a fan of peppers in cream sauce.  While I was cooking he was standing over my shoulder saying \"don't do it, there will be problems at the dinner table if you do.\"  Meaning that the kids (ages 6&9) wouldn't like it.  Well it was a hit.  Hubby went back for seconds, with a sheepish look on his face after giving me grief while I was preparing dinner.  I'm glad I made a double batch, because now I can pull the extra sauce out of the freezer for a quick week-night dinner. ",

Only change was that I cooked the sausage then added the onions peppers and mushrooms to cook - I don't like mushy vegetables so I also set this aside and cooked the sauce alone. Added everything together and it was wonderful. Also if you like spicy - try adding some red pepper to the dish it's amazing.",
