I use regular ketchup no chilli powder and sometimes I don't add the smoke flavor cuz I forget. lol. I do this recipe in a rush and it WORKS! I don't use exact measurements I add some of everything else and add depending on flavor and how much sauce I am trying to make. I only have four in my family so I make a small 7 pack of wings divided in pieces to make enough for everyone. Thank you so much for this recipe its great and its better then spending 9 on a order at the pizzeria =",

I had to make a couple of changes due to ingredients I did not have: left out liquid smoke and swapped hot/spicy ketchup for regular ketchup (added a dash of hot sauce to make up for this). So much better than bottled sauces and hubby commented on how good it was too. Thanks for a great recipe! Will be making this again:)",
