When we got up to our new cabin the stove wasn't working correctly so I cut the water down to about 1/4 cup or less, and did it in a crock pot for 8 hours on Low.  Turned out magnificently!  The orange wasn't discernable as a separate taste really (I'm not in the Fruit and Meat camp normally), but imparted a more complex flavor that is indescribable.  I only wish I had tried cooking the cabbage with the apple, but I barely remembered to cook the cabbage, the room smelled so great!  I served it with mustard.\n\n2007 addendum: Did this again in 2007, rinsed smaller brisket (3.25 lbs.), used included spice pack plus a little more pickling spice, one orange, one onion, celery salt (just two shakes) and 1/4 cup water in the 4 quart crock pot since it is about the same as cooking in a sealed oven...maybe a little moister so you have to cut the water down due to the practically sealed environment.  Again I used about 8 hours as the rule, but took it out in 7.  Turned out swell again this year!  But I must say, please, please get the more expensive cuts without all of the salt, etc..  Otherwise it tends to run a little salty.  This year I added a granny smith to the cabbage.  It was heavenly!  The prep for this is so simple because there's no dicing, just slice ingredients throw it all in the crockpot (shears minutes off wrapping in foil) and plug it in, but don't forget to turn it on!",

I followed the recipe exactly except that I cooked two 2.5-pound briskets in Reynolds Oven bags at 250 degrees for 5 hours.  The house smelled heavenly and there was no mess to clean up.  I loved the flavor of the cabbage and apples prepared separately (be careful not to overcook them).  This was an easy, ELEGANT YET EARTHY dinner that I served with tiny Yukon gold potatoes, Irish soda bread and Ruffino Chianti. We finished up with individual frozen green grasshopper tarts.
