I\u2019d never done this before, but I mixed dough for one batch of biscuits using a ready-made biscuit mix.  I kneaded it together in a big lump, rolled it out, and tore off 11 palm-sized chunks-I rolled them into balls and then flattened them into the cups on my muffin pan, using a spoon to create sort of a well inside my dough cups. I decided to use sage sausage as my sausage mixture without the other veggies-and  made the rest of the recipe per the instructions.  Used a glass pyrex measuring cup to pour eggs into the muffin cups.  Turned out beautifully!  We\u2019ve refrigerated the leftover pies and discovered that a 10 second zap in the microwave does the trick for those.  Fun, delicious recipe, thanks for sharing!",

It's nice to be able to have something hpt and hearty tasting without the mess of cleaning up breakfast dishes first thing in the morning!  I made mine with a smaller amount of hot italian sausage (maybe 1/4 pound) to cut back on the fat and calories and I used a tube of eight \"flaky layer\" biscuits and used only about 3/4 of a biscuit rolled out for each one so I ended up with 12 \"pies\", and increased the eggs to 4.  I also omitted the onion and green peppers and added a little black pepper and onion powder to the egg mixture.  They turned out great!!  This a great recipe because you can custom make them however your family likes their eggs!  A sprinkle of tabasco sauce on top, and we've got breakfast!",
