Of course, after you roll the apples in various toppings, the apples look HUGE!  :o)  I made a variety- macadamia, pecan, coconut, heath, and plain.  No problems at all with the toppings sticking.  I did have to let them sit overnight to harden before wrapping them up.  These will be perfect for the fundraiser we are doing.  Thanks!  ",

I agree with another reader that the toppings would not stick to the apple. After attempting toppings with a test apple I left off the toppings on the others. After an hour at room temperature the apples weren't completely dry. I placed them in the refrigerator overnight on waxed paper and they hardened perfectly. I was able to make 11 large apples with 1 1/2 lbs. chocolate and I had some left over to make chocolate covered marshmallows. I will make these again next fall.",
