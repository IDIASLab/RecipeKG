Worked out to 20.3 calories per ounce (weight) exact or ~99 calories per cup. I made per recipe but with 1.5 tbs of olive oil and added 21 oz (wt) of fresh cubed potatoes with 15 minutes left in step 3 so they would soften. I used 93/7 ground beef, which weighed 28.4 oz when cooked and completely drained. I weighed everything to a tenth of an ounce including the final weight of the soup  and totaled calories for each ingredient (as I generally do). Total was 4363.4 calories and 214.5 oz (wt).  We had two meals for 3 people and froze 3 quarts for  later. Great recipe.",
