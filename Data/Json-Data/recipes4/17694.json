I didn't have several of the spices on hand so I left out the basil, turmeric and garam masala (which I've never even heard of), also adjusted the cumin down at the suggestion of the other reviewer, and reduced the mustard by 1 T since it was a little too mustard-y for me otherwise. Instead of deep frying I made little patties and fried them in a frying pan. But my favorite way to enjoy this recipe is to simply use the filling as a spread on crackers or just eat plain. (Saves tons of calories and great when you're craving something salty.) I did take the submitter's suggestion and put the sauerkraut in the food processor, which gives it a great texture. And it's even better the next day! Thank you, Emma, for sharing this recipe!",
