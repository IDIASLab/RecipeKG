Here's how u fix it....\n\nIf u want something vaguely \"Louisiana\" let's start by adding plenty of creole seasoning and some cayenne pepper.  The sauce consistency is nice, but it's so bland that you'll also need soy or tamari sauce to make it pop (I used a decent amount of tamari).  Make sure you sautee your mushrooms along w/a few garlic cloves and lovely strips of onion.  Season w/oregano, fresh parsley and finish w/a few pats of butter.  I can't imagine pairing this w/cheddar cheese, so I topped w/shaved aged asiago.  I used fresh mushrooms and cream of portabello mushroom.",
