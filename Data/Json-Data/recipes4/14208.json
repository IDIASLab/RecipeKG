This really is a recipe that you just eye ball as it cooks.

Based on what I had on-hand, I had to rearrange things a little, but I tried to keep as close to the recipe as I could. I browned the chops first, then made the sauce and stuffing mixture. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup on hand, so I nearly tripled the sauce recipe (actually used 1/3 cup sherry, 1/3 cup flour, and about 3 cups milk), and seasoned with No-Salt Seasoning, also from this site, plus a little salt and pepper. I removed about 1 1/2 cups of the sauce from the pan before stirring in the stuffing mix. Topped the chops with the stuffing mixture, one slice of provolone cheese, and the remaining gravy. It was absolutely WONDERFUL, and as much as I hated to deviate from your father's recipe, I'm so glad you shared it, and I'm glad it led to such a great meal for us. Can't wait to try the original version, too - hopefully next time I'll be better prepared and have all the stuff ready! Thanks for sharing, Pam!",

This is an ideal dish for you to put your own spin on and I'll bet the same cook probably wouldn't make this the same way twice! In my case I did NOT brown the chops first. These boneless chops are so lean I didn't want to risk overcooking them. I put them in a foil-lined plan for easy clean up that I had oiled lightly with olive oil. I seasoned the chops with salt pepper and poultry seasoning (a good place for your own spin here in terms of seasonings!) To the stuffing itself I added chopped celery cuz Hubs likes it. I found it kind of drab looking and seriously in need of some color easily rectified with a little chopped parsley. To the sauce I added a good glug of white wine (Chardonnay) as well as a couple of shakes of Worcestershire sauce. Perfectly baked juicy and tender after 30 minutes and like meatloaf good comfort food. Bonus for calling for boneless chops good clean eatin with no bone to have to work around!",

                "reviewBody": "We loved this recipe. At first I thought it was way too much stuffing but it really wasn't. We love fresh mushrooms so next time I think I'll add more but we gave it a 2 thumb up. It was even better as leftovers!! The only thing different I did was not add the sherry because I ddn't have any. Believe it or not I just poured in a little half & half for moisture.",
