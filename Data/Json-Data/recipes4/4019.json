Will definitely make it again but use fresh not previously frozen ground beef if that does'nt fix it maybe one more egg and an increase in the breadcrumbs to make it firm. very yummy!",

I'm pretty sure you should only add one egg per lb of meat which is most likely why it is too loose as written it either needs 2 lbs of meat or 1 egg. I choose the latter. I shaped it into a loaf on a foil-covered cookie sheet (with edges) rather than in a loaf pan. Also I let the meat loaf \"rest\" for about 5 minutes before slicing it. I gave it 5 stars because most meatloaf recipes do not translate well to a turkey meatloaf but this one was very good as is.",
