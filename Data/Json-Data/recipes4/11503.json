First, the originator of the recipe posted a review in which she said she forgot to say that the meat mixture should be simmered for 15 minutes.  Second, make sure to thoroughly drain your cooked spinach.  I put mine in several layers of paper towels and squeezed until no more liquid came out.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added more seasoning to the meat, and I sauteed the onion and garlic with the meat as well.  The result was a very flavorful dish that I'm sure I will make again.",

The only problem I had was after I put it in the oven I realized that the acutal directions don't say what to do with the 2 cloves of garlic. When it came out it did seem to be missing something so I'm assuming the garlic probably could have gone in the spinach mixture. I would also like to try substituting spaghetti for the tomato sauce and ricotta for the cottage cheese. I will definetly make this again though and tweak it a bit. It still came out yummy and it's definetly a way to spruce up plain old ground beef. It's leftover friendly too Thanks Sarah!",

I doubled all the rest of the spices the onion and the Parmesan cheese. To combat the dryness that people complained about I used a #2 can of no-salt added diced tomatoes for an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and did not add any water. Subbed ground turkey for the beef and Provolone cheese for the Mozzarella. Did not pre-cook anything--just squeezed ALL the moisture out of the spinach and diced the onion very fine. While we couldn t specifically taste the cottage cheese all the flavors blended together so well that my hubby said that this was a GREAT light version of lasagna and that we should have it often. And we will since it is so very simple to make.",

Everything else was unchanged....and it was just fantastic. I just polished off the leftovers for my lunch and it was even better.",
