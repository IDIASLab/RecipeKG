However I cooked the pork too long on low (9hrs) since I left it while I was at work and it became shredded pork. Also I was surprised at how much liquid remained after cooking for 8 hours on low. I didn't add both cans of chicken stock and I wouldn't recommend to either. I ended up shredding the pork and then cutting up the cooked vegetables into smaller pieces and made a pork stew. Add a little bit more seasoning (garlic salt steak seasoning) and worchester sauce when I reheat it and it was delicious.",

I prepared everything the night before and marinated the pork overnight. To use ingredients I had on hand I substituted 1 tsp each of dried thyme and cilantro instead of the fresh and 1 tbsp of fresh marjoram instead of the dried. I used a 1.5 lb bag of mini potatoes no cutting required. Four hours later the meat was perfectly cooked and moist and the potatoes were nice and tender not mushy. The roast looked very appealing thanks to the searing. While it was cooking I took four Mackintosh apples I had in the fridge and cooked them down into a quick apple sauce and served it with the pork. Delicious! I would definitely use this recipe again for a small pork roast. Thanks for the recipe.",
