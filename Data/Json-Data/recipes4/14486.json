The one negative I have is that I think the peanut butter taste dominated too much so I'd use less the next time and add more if necessary after tasting.

I sauteed the garlic and pepper (jalapeno instead of habanero) before blending and used white balsamic and some apple cider vinegar. I really liked the texture and the flavor was good but I think could be improved by using the right pepper and vinegar. I will saute again. I ate an entire plate of greens so it served it's purpose! It is creamy a little sweet with a little heat- just about the perfect dressing!",

I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of the black sesame seeds. I substituted 1/4 teaspoon of sesame oil. The dressing was wonderful special in fact. It had some heat but not too much for me and I usually get a 2 star (of 4) at a Thai restaurant. Peppers do vary though so suggest tasting dressing before inflicting on guests. The 12 servings are very small. I think 6 servings is more accurate and that's a bit of a stretch. Great dressing!",
