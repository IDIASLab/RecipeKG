I also left the peel on & sliced them that way. I took another persons advice & mixed the potatoes, cheese & onions in a bowl, put them on the bottom, poured milk over top and put pats of butter in as well. Then placed the chops over all that. I also poured a little bit of milk over the chops. Halfway through, I pulled the chops off, stirred the potatoes & put the chops back on making sure I flipped them. I used a lot of pepper (I am not a big salt fan). I also noticed it a little \"watery\" after the hour, so I left them in there a bit longer & took some of the juices and put over the chops. I think I may have used a little too much butter, but my fiancee who is SOOOOOOOOO picky about food, really enjoyed this. He voluntarily said, \"This is something you can make again, this is really good\"",

I changed things alittle by  slicing my potatoes and microwaving them for about 5 min. first, but I pretty much kept everything else the same. I salt/peppered and alittle garlic powder on the chops before baking and mixed the oinions, potatoes and cheese up in a bowl, then put in pan, covered with milk and butter and chops. This turned out really good, with just the right flavor and chops were pretty tender. Great recipe!",

I covered the dish hoping that would help cook the potatoes a little longer but I still ended cooking them an extra 30 minutes uncovering in the last 20 minutes. I don't know if it was the covering of the dish but the milk did not cook in completely and the potatoes were still pretty milky. Overall good taste but I think I will add flour in with the potatoes next time to try to thicken it up.",

We use a can of cream of mushroom and celery soup, and 2 cans of milk.  Mix the soup and milk together, then in the baking dish, mix the soup mixture with the potatoes.  Nesle the chops into the potatoes, so they are almost covered in the soup mix. Bake covered until the potatoes are tender and meat juices run clear.
