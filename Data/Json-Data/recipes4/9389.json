I used two cans of chicken broth and enough cornstarch to make it a little thicker.  This turned out very flavorful!",

I made a few changes beforehand such as seasoning the chicken in lemon pepper and basil added a little more soy sauce added some chopped up cabbage and bean sprouts instead of green beans.

I served it over rice and added some crispy chow mein noodles on the top. Making it made me have more interest in studying asian dishes as we can never find a good asian restaurant anymore. They've all practically turned into fast food or buffets now!",

I found the sauce a little bland I think it needs about twice the soy sauce and perhaps a bit of chicken bullion powder for a more intense chicken-y flavor.

Tasted fine like that but I am looking forward to making it again with a few alterations and fresh veggies. Overall it made a great meal!",
