I also accidentally tripled the garlic to 2 tablespoons. I loved it. I served it with a loaf of fresh sun-dried tomato bread and it made for a nice hearty dinner. One word of caution: where the recipe says \"large pot \" it really means \"the biggest pot you've got!\" EDIT 01/28/2009: This is my most frequently used and requested recipe. I've made this more times than I can count! A couple things I've learned over time: 1. For a bit more flavor mix hot and sweet sausage half and half. 2. Cook the pasta separately (or add a lot more broth). I cook and store the pasta separately except when freezing portions. To freeze it I add the pasta and cooled soup into one container and freeze immediately. This prevents the pasta from soaking up all the liquid in the soup. Thanks again for a great recipe!",

First I used homemade chicken broth that already had pieces of chicken in it. The combination of the chicken with the Italian sausage was a nice contrast in flavors and textures! I added fresh cremini mushrooms Italian seasoning rather than just basil leeks as well as onions zucchini cannellini beans a good glug of red wine (an appropriate Sangiovese) and a Parmigiano-Reggiano rind (I keep them stored in the freezer). I also subbed fresh escarole for the spinach (had I used spinach I would have used fresh). Quick easy aromatic incredibly flavorful and immensely satisfying.",
