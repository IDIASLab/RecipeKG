I added finely chopped celery to the cream cheese to give it a little crunch because I also did not use the bacon. I love bacon but I didn't have any. It really doesn't matter too much what you use as long as you keep the turkey and the cranberry sauce. That combination is heavenly. It's very good on any seeded bread. Very hearty and rustic that way. I also added alfalfa sprouts.",
