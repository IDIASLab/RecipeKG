The main thing with this recipe is to reduce the oil to just 1/2 cup (1/2 cup of apple sauce also works very well). I did add one cup of white chocolate chips and 1 teaspoon of strawberry extract and one teaspoon of almond extract. I baked two of these cake for the guys at work and everybody loved it. The cake had disappeared so fast. The result was a very moist and flavorful bundt. certainly be making this cake again. Forgot to mention I used the Pilsbury cake mix.",
