That means that the spices were more of a liquid so they didn't stick as well. I will be doing this recipe again soon. UPDATE: I did this again and found that despite all the spices it wasn't amazing. When I did it correctly I found that the spices caked on the potatoes. I think that a reduction in the \"spicy\" spices would allow the other ones to stand out. Also there is no salt in the recipe.",
