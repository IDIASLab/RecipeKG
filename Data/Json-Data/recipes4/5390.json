I had not soaked my beans overnight but, fear not there is a solution, I just brought them to a boil in about 5 inches of water and then turned off the heat and let them soak for an hour. After that time I poured out the water and started the recipe. Instead of ham I used two ham hocks and no lard. I used a 48oz. box of chicken broth and after some of that juice had boiled down I added an additional 32oz. box of vegetable broth. I also noticed that I inadvertently used only 1tsp. of the oregano and thought the beans tasted great. This will undoubtedly be my go to recipe from now on.",

Because it is an all-vegetarian potluck, I omitted the ham and lard, used MorningStar beef-like crumbles, and kicked up the flavor by adding McKay's Beef-Like broth/seasoning. I used half a green bell pepper, saving the other half for our salads. Husband loved it, picky Daughter had two servings, and I even got to scrape the crockpot and have a spoonful over my rice. I plan to make this again for my little family, keeping it vegetarian. Normally I do not like pinto beans, and usually only have them refried. This is definitely a keeper, and I know it'll be good for church potlucks. Thank you for sharing!",
