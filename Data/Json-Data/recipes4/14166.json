Gorgeous presentation delicately seasoned rice with the green onion lemon and butter that plays the supporting role to your main meat or fish dish perfectly. I love basmati rice and it was definitely the right choice for this. I used baby arugula rather than the spinach only because it's what I had in the fridge not because I thought it was a better choice. I cooked the rice in chicken broth and the white part of the green onion then stirred the green part in at the end to preserve its color. I used the lemon juice \"to taste \" just a little squeeze - less than the recipe called for. This was the ideal complement to \"Veal Cutlet with Red Peppers \" also from this site. Happy to be the first reviewer of your recipe JusSuz! Nicely done!",

Only difference is I used chicken broth in lieu of the water which gave the dish a little more depth and used fresh coarse cracked pepper. The extra bite from the pepper with the rice provided an occasional extra burst of flavor Loved the presentation and was the perfect pairing served with salmon. Thanks JusSuz for your submission.",

I did saute the green onion and a little bit of minced garlic slightly in a tbsp. of EVOO before adding the water. My husband and I thought this was great especially me but the kids were less than enthused. Whatever I'm making it again no matter what they say.;) I REALLY liked the flavor of the brown rice with the green onions garlic and the lemon. I served this with Coq Au Vin My Way which is also from this site. Probably not the best pairing but we ate every bite.",

Even with the addition of the green onions the rice is not overpowering which is exactly what I was looking for. I used brown rice instead of the basmati because I didn't have any basmati rice and I wanted to make it a litttle healthier. I also used a combo of butter alternative and olive oil. Again to make the rice a little healthier. The spinach is not really needed since it's just for presentation purposes but the color does give it a nice contrast. Thanks.",
