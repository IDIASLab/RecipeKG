As one of the reviewers mentioned it's a little messy to roll them but I preservered and kept them a little tighter at the beginning of the roll; keeping as much of the topping inside the roll as possible. They were pretty big rolls and turned out great. I also used 3 breasts as someone else did and spooned some Alfredo and cheese on the top before baking. I will definitely make this again the ranch mix throws a nice taste in the mix! the family loved it!",
