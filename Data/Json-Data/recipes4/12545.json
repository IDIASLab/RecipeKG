First of all why add 3 cups of water to the chicken broth it just watered it down I ended up adding some chicken bullion to it to bring some of the flavor back. Secondly adding the veggies the way stated in the instructions makes for some very over cooked veggies. I will make the soup again but next time I will not add the extra water but extra broth. I ll add the veggies the same time I add the tortellini and won t have the soup simmer 25 minutes with the chicken before adding the veggies 15 minutes of simmering is plenty before adding the veggies. I also added a handful of spinach at the very end just before serving giving it just enough time to wilt before spooning it out into bowls. Some of my family don t like Parmesan cheese so we just added it to our own bowls for those of us who wanted it. I think with these changes it will make a much better soup. I also have to say that I didn t add the lemon pepper because I didn t have any on hand I just use ground black pepper.",

You can use leftover chix breast instead of cooking it in the soup--great way to get rid of leftover chicken plus using fresh veggies make it healthy too. The before I broiled chicken breast with garlic pepper and olive oil for 15 minutes. It sat over night in the fridge and I cut it up the next night for the soup. I added it last just to warm it up.
