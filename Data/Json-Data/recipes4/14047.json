        "description": "On Lunar Chinese New Year, we usually like to have meatballs or sweet dumplings. Ball in Chinese is 'wan,' sweet dumpling in Chinese is 'tang yuan.' Their shapes are both round. So we use a meatball dish and/or sweet dumpling dish to emphasize the Chinese expression 'He Jia Tuan Yuan.' 'He Jia' means the whole family. 'Tuan Yuan' means 'all be together' ('yuan' also means circle, round as well, which connects with the shape of the meatballs and the sweet dumplings). This tofu ball dish is easy to make, and it is a great soup for your Lunar New Year meal.",

Its not really a complaint though as the soup is supposed to be simple. I would add some miso paste and garlic to the tofu balls as well as put some ginger and lemon grass in the broth. The best thing about this recipe is that you can use it as a base to do whatever you like! Its my new standby.",

Or even to simmer with a 2 to 3 thin slices of ginger. I agree with the other poster that this is a very easy recipe to tweak by adding things like different veggies and such. (Mmmmm mushrooms!) Chinese cuisine has flavors that range from subtle to loud. There is not one fixed note. I'm going to make the comment here that miso paste lemongrass etc are not Chinese ingredients. Miso is traditionally Japanese and lemongrass is a staple in Southeast Asian countries. Both would probably make delicious variations as this is a simple soup but just wanted to put this out there in case anyone reading is searching for authenticity.",

I didn't have soft tofu so I used shelf-stable Mori-Nu Firm silken tofu with 6 oz ground pork and 5 TBLs cornstarch. You may want a little more broth.",
