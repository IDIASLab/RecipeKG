I do agree with the first reviewer that grilled veggies are a stand out on their own....but I disagree in a 2 star rating....I thought this was really very good. I used leftover Simple Grilled Vegetables from this site...asparagus. zucchini yellow squash tomatoes and mushrooms. This dish was perfect for leftovers. I roughly chopped the veggies and then made the quick dressing and tossed and chilled until dinner. I did decrease the dressing to 1 tblspn of olive oil 2 tblspns red wine vinegar 1 tablspn of dijon the garlic salt and cracked pepper. Great flavors and I would definately make again. Thanks!",

Yes grilled vegetables stand on their own and don't need a dressing but if you are grilling for a crowd sometimes there isn't room on the grill for everything. You can make this dish ahead of time and then save the grill for the meat. I think the salad is even better the next day after the vegetables have soaked up some of the dressing. I've also added fusilli pasta to it and served it on a bed of arugula.",

Added a little salt and lots of ground black pepper to my personal helping. YUM",
