My son who dislikes chicken even ate it!  I have a large family so I used 3 breasts, split horizontally to make 6 pieces.  I also doubled the rice and water.  It filled my 9x13 pan nicely and I still had plenty of the mayo mixture to evenly coat the chicken breasts and then some!  Everyone in my family loved the mayo mix and parmesan on the chicken.  I found 1/2 cup of the parmesan was more than enough.   I didn't have fresh rosemary so used about 2+ teaspoons dried rosemary.  I only had brown rice on hand, so used that, but consequently the rice was not done by the time the chicken was.  Not the recipe's fault as brown rice takes longer to cook and I should have considered that.  Next time I will either use white rice or I will just bake the brown rice for a while until half cooked, then add the chicken and bake for another 45 minutes.  Also, I added frozen peas to the rice mixture.  I really liked the extra color and taste the peas added to the dish.  I felt like it rounded out the meal and added extra nutrition.  This dish would be great served with some homemade rolls!  Thanks for a great recipe!",

The only change I made was to use dried basil instead of Rosemary since that's what I had on hand.  I also doubled the rice and water because my kids eat a lot of rice.  You end up with moist chicken, fluffy rice and delicious sauce, with only one pan to clean.  What more could you ask for?  My husband and triplet 15 year olds loved it and asked if I could make it again, soon!  One more thing, my husband doesn't like mayonnaise so I made sure not to tell him the main ingredient.

When the chicken was done there was a lot of liquid in the pan so I just dumped the rice in and mixed it with the liquid because the rice was thick and dry.  Three grown men said it was the best rice they ever had!  The chicken was good too.  Will def make again but will probably make the (precooked) rice along with the chicken.",

Instead of using rice since I didn't have any I used Couscous.
