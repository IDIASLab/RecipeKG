I bumped up the heat to 380 for the last half and the potatoes were nicely browned and the meat had a nice crust on it.  As I was adding the boiled potatoes, I tossed in some big slices of carrots and onion and seasoned it all together.  As the roast was resting I also stirred in a few handfulls of frozen peas for more color (the heat from the veggies warms them up just right).  I'm glad I let the meat rest for a while, it stayed so juicy after I cut into it.\n\nAs a side dish, I chopped up a few apples into a saucepan with 1/4 cup brown sugar and 2 tbsp lemon juice and let the whole mixture simmer for about 30 minutes.  The whole meal got rave reviews, both from my family and another couple that I made this for.  The only complaint was from my husband, who had to endure the tantalizing smells coming from the oven while he waited for it to be cooked!",

I've been looking for a pork recipe that wasn't sweet and this one did the trick!\r\nFor those who complained of a dry roast, I HIGHLY recommenend a digital alarm thermometer that goes off when your pork reaches the right tempature, instead of setting a timer.  It is SO easy to overcook pork that this really is a life-saver.  Plus, don't forget to let the pork rest for 10 mintues or all of the juices will just run out the second you cut it.\r\n\r\nAs for the recipe itself, the only changes I made was that I used half red potatoes and half sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes.  Yum, yum, yum!  I will be making this on a regular basis.  Thanks for the great recipe!",
