I used a few baby rainbow carrots red pepper and added some yellow squash that I needed to use up; but other than that I kept everything else the same. It's great over rice or pasta too. And not only is it delicious but it's a really fast and easy dinner to make! Thank you for the recipe!",

The flavor was delicious though!!  I served it with rice and ended up pouring the (somewhat runny) juices on top of everything.  I used low sodium soy sauce to protect the hubbies fragile ticker, but otherwise followed the recipe.  We\u2019ll definitely be making this one again!",

Fairly certain the taste would still have been amazing.  I subbed maple syrup for the honey and am just now realizing that I skipped the addition of water (I suspect that would have made the sauce too thin, anyway).  Will definitely make this again, with all the ingredients next time.  This recipe does NOT disappoint!",
