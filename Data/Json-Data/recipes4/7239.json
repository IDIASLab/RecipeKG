I cooked it on High for 3 hrs but lowered it to Low for the last half-hour. Our local bulk food store sells regular dried Turkish apricots as well as \"pitted tart apricots\" which is a more firm candied-like apricot. I used both in the recipe for comparison and found that the regular apricots were almost mush by the end of the 3 hrs while the tart apricots still had some firmness to them. I would use the tart ones again next time or else toss some additional regular dried apricots in at least an hour before the end of the cooking time. Not a big fan of cilantro so I omitted it.",
