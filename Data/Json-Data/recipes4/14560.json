The coffee added a bitter burnt taste to what was a too-greasy meat sauce. All the oil just adds more grease to the fat from the ground beef that isn't drained out. It was a high school cafeteria meat sauce. It has OK flavor but the pool of red grease on top made it something I wouldn't make again exactly as the recipe directs. The almost 1/3 cup of added oil is way over the top and you should definitely drain out the fat from the ground beef. The secret ingredient coffee flavor could be done a little better by saut\u00e9ing the tomato paste in ONE Tablespoon of the olive oil at the beginning of the recipe and then adding the cooked and DRAINED beef and omitting the coffee and the additional 1/4 cup (4 TBS) of olive oil called for in the original version.",
