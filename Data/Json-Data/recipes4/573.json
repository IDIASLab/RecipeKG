I decided to bake them instead of fry them so they didn't taste just like Hooters but they were still great and much better for you. I followed the instructions exact except I baked on a rack set over a jelly roll pan at 350 for 45 minutes. Then I turned the oven to 375 and sprayed the wings with Pam and let them bake 5 more minutes so they got crispy. Excellent and you'll never miss the deep fried taste!",

The secret I picked up from buying the expensive Hooter's Brand wing breading and wing sauce in the grocery is this; Don't skip the step to refrigerate the wings for 60-90 minutes. After this rest the spiced flour on the wings becomes sticky. Now they are ready to fry. This IS the secret to great breaded wings like this! Spices in the flour can be varied to taste. Also to simplify I use about 2/3 butter to 1/3 Frank's Hot Sauce for sauce. Melted in the microwave it tastes like a million bucks! The expensive Hooter's wing sauce also taught me that for the hotter sauce use a greater proportion of sauce to butter. The mild Hooter's sauce uses a larger proportion of butter to sauce.",

I cooked these last night and followed directions as stated, with one exception I only kept them in the fridge for maybe 40mins before frying, I truly believe this step is what makes them so crispy and the seasoning was right on spot. Next time I will leave in the fridge for 90mins as stated. The sauce was great!!!. I have cooked the Buffalo Chicken Wings I from this site in the past, and not to take away from that recipe it is good. This recipe is the one I will use from now on for my hot wings. UPDATE!!! THIS IS ANOTHER RECIPE THAT I CAN NOT STOP MAKING, I NOW ALSO ADD ONION POWDER, GARLIC POWDER AND SEASON SALT TO MY FLOUR MIXTURE, I NEVER SKIP THE FRIDGE STEP, IF YOU DO, JUST TRY IT THE RECIPE WAY I'M SURE YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFERENCE, I NEVER BUY HOT WINGS OUT ANY MORE!!!!!. THIS IS AN UPDATE ON MY UPDATE!!! I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO COOK TONIGHT AND WHILE READING REVIEWS THIS CAME UP AGAIN, JUST SEEING THIS RECIPE MAKE ME CRAVE IT MORE, OH WELL GUESS IT'S HOT WINGS AGAIN TONIGHT, THIS IS TRULY HOW GOOD THIS RECIPE IS.",

We do not bread our wings for a starter.  Being territorial of our wings, let me just say that you should only use FRANKS RED HOT SAUCE and the ratio to the butter should be 1 stick to every 12 oz.  Also the oil should be around 400 degrees.  One thing that will keep your wings crispy is to not over-saturate them with sauce.  Let them set and 'drip dry' for several minutes so the sauce can stick to the chicken instead of sliding off the oil then put them in a large bowl.  Using a ladle give em one scoop full and then toss, coating evenly and adding small amounts of sauce to cover completely.  You should not have a pool in the bottom when you're done.",

We loved the wings and we love spicy foods, but these were just too hot and the sauce was very thin and watery.  I made some more last night for just my husband and me using Texas Pete and it was perfect.  They had the perfect amount of heat.  I also followed the directions except for frying.  I baked then in the oven for about 30 mins. at 350.  I lightly sprinkled them with flour then sprayed cooking spray on them and they had a great crust coming out of the oven.  Definetly recommend!!!",

I wasn't sure if I needed to still put them in the fridge since I was baking them, but I did. I put them on baking sheets sprinkled with alittle more flour and sprayed with pam. I baked @400 for 40 min turning once then I put some BBQ sauce on some and the hot sauce on the others and baked @300 for 15min... they were great!
