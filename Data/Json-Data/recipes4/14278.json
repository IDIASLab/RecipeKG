                "reviewBody": "I was very pleased at how this recipe turned out. I was a little wary reading the reviews that stated there was too strong a lemon flavor and that the chicken was dry but I went for it anyway and made the recipe as directed. The only (minor) change I made was that I had to use a chicken that was nearly 4 pounds because I could not find a 3 pound one. It was relatively difficult to get the skin off the chicken but not impossible. I cooked this on low for about 9 hours while we were at work. When I came home the chicken was incredibly tender; as I lifted it out of the cooker it fell totally apart! So I suppose presentation-wise it may not look as nice as would be ideal. The flavor of both the chicken and potatoes was neither too strong nor too light in my opinion. I don't really know that any changes are needed to this recipe except maybe some additional veggies could be thrown in if you like such as carrots. Thanks for the great recipe!",

But it was no good.\" I'll give this 2 stars b/c despite the effort of skinning the chicken (blech) coming home from work to a crockpot meal that's ready is a nice convenience. The potatoes at the bottom absorbed all the flavor and juices (a little overwhelming on the lemon) and were too soggy in my opinion. The breast-side of the chicken was inedible it was so unbelievably Saharan. It was also very visually unappealing. The lower portion of the chicken that sat in more of the broth was moist so I shredded it from the bone and am hoping to salvage it into a pita w/ feta cheese and veggies for lunch today but truth be told most of these leftovers will be getting tossed.

Since the potatoes are sliced pretty thick I only cut my carrots into thirds. I cooked it on high set for 6 hours but the timer popped after 5. It was falling off the bone and cooked perfectly as were the potatoes and carrots! There was so much juice in the pan I decided to throw together a quick gravy melted about 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan and whisked in about 3 tablespoons of flour for the roux then added about a cup of the liquid a little at a time. There's just so many great flavors going on in that juice between the onion and the garlic and the lemon! My only critique is that it probably doesn't need the olive oil or maybe only half as much. The lemon flavor was there but subtle not strong or overpowering at all. I'll definitely make this one again!",
