I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and they were a big hit at my holiday party. If you are going to have them out for several hours in a crockpot as I did, I would suggest doubling the bbq sauce/preserve combo as it tended to be absorbed. Also, spray the crockpot with cooking spray for easier cleanup. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I've made these tree times so far, changing only the hot sauce.  The first time I made them with Franks Red Hot Chili and Lime, which was delicious.  The second I used simple Tabasco.  This most recent I used Cholula.  I think I'll stick with Cholula because it has just the right zip, and you can't beat the subtle tang.  I love this recipe and highly recommend it to anyone who's contemplating giving it a try.",
