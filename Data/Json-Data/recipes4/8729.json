Add 1/2 cup of freshly graded Romano to the mozzarella as well as a 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar. I also add ricotta or cottage cheese to the pasta and sauce mixture before I top the pasta bake with the 3 cheese combo. I also omitted the veggies and added Italian sausage along with the pepperoni. Best baked in a glass pan. Note that this can be pre-made and stored for up to 24 hours covered with plastic wrap in the fridge. That's you can come home from work and slap it in the oven and relax. Or you can do the prep earlier in the day when you have more energy and all you have to do before the Spouse gets home is the baking part. Serve with a fresh green or garden salad. Yum!!",
