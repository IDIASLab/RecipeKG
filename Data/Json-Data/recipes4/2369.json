I didn't have garlic cream cheese spread, so I mixed some powdered ranch dressing mix into the cream cheese and it tasted great. I also sliced a pocket in my chicken breast and stuffed instead of rolling (Live on the top floor of an apt, didn't want to be banging chicken). I also did not freeze, but cooked right away. The only problem I had was I did not use toothpicks and since my chicken breasts were so thick, some of the filling had leaked out. SO I would recommend doing as the recipe suggests as far as the technique, but the ranch dressing in the cream cheese was perfect. Also, I would recommend dipping the chicken in something before rolling in bread crumbs because the bread crumbs did not stick as well without it. And use panko!",

The photo chicken breast was 10 oz (huge) and again it was slightly overcooked at 20 minutes at 375. My supermarkets do not carry garlic-flavored cream cheese so I used lower fat cream cheese and added garlic powder (and some chopped chives) to it. I also used some herb seasoned Pepperidge Farm stuffing which I crushed and used for the breading. What you can do with the cream cheese filling is almost unlimited. My recommendation would be to bake for 15 minutes at 375 degrees F and then use a thermometer to check the internal temp of the chicken. This is very good but would be even better if cooked properly so it ends up juicy.",

I used a Kraft garlic & parmesan cream cheese dip in the middle I used Italian herb mix in place of the Italian seasoning used plain bread crumbs and I used only butter rather than butter and oil when I fried the chicken. Firstly there was way too much \"sprinkling\" herbs - I only used a quarter of it if that. I poured the butter from the pan over the chicken before baking it. It needed to be in the oven for 30 minutes and came out nicely. However I think the recipe calls for far too much garlic. I am usually quite insensitive to garlic but this really was too much. Next time I make it I will modify it and use my own herb/spice mixture. A good concept though with some changes.",
