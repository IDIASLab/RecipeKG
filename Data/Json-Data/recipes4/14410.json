Even though they don't have a liqueur incorporated with the cake, I call them zuccotto cupcakes because of the whipped cream filling and ganache topping.

I used a regular home-made muffin dough (for 12 muffins: 2.5 cups flour 1.5 cups white sugar 5 eggs 3/4 cups 2 tblsp margerine 2 tblsp vanilla sugar 2 tblsp baking powder) melted the chocholate and added some cocoa powder just to make the color more even. As I didn't have any toffee bits at hand and don't like nuts I simply used the triple amount of raspberries. Oh yeah and I replaced the butter in the frosting by sour cream just to soothe my conscience about all the fatty calories:) Chocolaty heaven!",

We used a boxed chocolate cake mix with pudding so we didn't add the 6 oz. of chopped chocolate. We didn't use toffee bits or hazelnuts so we added a bit more powdered sugar to the filling. We used a melon baller to core out the middle. We used a reviewer's suggestion of the food processor to mix the ganache - we did so while the cupcakes were baking & cooling so it was perfect texture by the time we filled the middle. Lastly splurge a little on piping bags & tips (our grovery store sold 4 tips & 20 bags in a set for 3.99) - it makes the process much faster. PS - we used the \"left overs\" (like the middle of the cupcakes) to make a torte (layer chunks of cupcakes with raspberry cream - alternate & top off with ganache and/or frosting)",

I made it three ways - cupcakes, mini cupcakes and I baked a 9\" round that I split and filled with the whipped cream.\n\nI wouldn't recommend doing the cake unless you slice it before you chill the frosting too much.  Both layers of frosting get very firm when chilled, which will make them really easy to transport without a lot of damage.\n\nThe minis came out nicely, and they're rich enough that it's a good bite.  I'd probably just do those next time.  For the minis though, I'd recommend slicing up fresh raspberries so that it's easier to pipe the cream into them.

                "reviewBody": "Well I must say I was disappointed. I also follow a recipe exactly the first time before I start tweaking. For some reason I didn't think the flavors came together well and seemed to lack a focal point. Overall a good recipe but there was no punch--maybe because there were so many flavors nothing seemed to stand out. All the fine chopping for the bittersweet chocolate in the cupcakes was totally lost in any flavor--looked pretty but you couldn't taste the chocolate bits. Filling was okay would add a lot more of the toffee bits to step it up a notch. The ganache was the easiest I ever made but wasn't a standout. And last the frosting...didn't do it for me either. It seems each section (the cupcake filling ganache and frosting) were good on their own it just didn't come together well. Although there were a ton of flavors the cupcake seemed boring. Was not worth the cost of ingredients or time. Was fun to make but will keep searching for an amazing cupcake.",
