They were still not quite tender enough, but the soup's flavors were good.  It needed more water than called for so I also added some vegetable base to give it more flavor (boullion \"paste\" I use from a jar).  I also added celery.\nUPDATE: I discovered later that dried garbanzos require soaking time (overnight or the quick-soak method I mentioned above), plus up to an hour and a half of cooking time!  In the soup they probably only got 30-45 minutes, so that explained their hardness.  I'll save time next time by using canned, or plan ahead more!",

My guess is this recipe would be better served one or two days later.  1 onion or 1-1/2 cups, chopped 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 (14.5) oz. can Del Monte tomatoes with basil, garlic & oregano (no salt added),   pulsed lightly in the food processor 2 cups broth (I used pan drippings/broth left over broth from baking cornish hens the night before) 1/4 cup celery, finely diced 1/4 cup carrot, finely diced 2 tablespoons green pepper, finely diced 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon chili powder 1/2 teaspoon red pepper 1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste 1/2 teaspoon black pepper or to taste 1 (15 oz.) can garbanzo beans  Saute onion in oil in skillet until onion begins to brown. Add garlic, cook and stir until lightly browned. Transfer to a stew pot and add tomatoes, broth, celery, carrot, green pepper, seasonings and garbanzo beans. Simmer on low heat for about 30 minutes or until carrot is tender.   ",

This helped a bit with the flavor but I still thought it could use a bit more. However I didn't use nearly as much pepper as called for--I can't handle that much red and black pepper! I didn't use 2 cans of tomatoes; instead I subbed the water for chicken broth and added 2 more cups of liquid. I don't have just carrots so I used a veggie mix I have in the freezer. Turned out well enough but it definitely would have been very tomatoe-y and thick if I'd followed the recipe as written. I like thick soups but it would have been too thck for me so I'm glad I added the extra broth. thanks for the recipe.",
