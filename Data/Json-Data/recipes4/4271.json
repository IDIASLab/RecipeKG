I always add Old Bay for a little spice to my seafood recipes. I love clam chowder and love the Old England clam chowder but I am trying to eat healthier and this fits the ticket for my clam chowder fix. I used turkey bacon in mine but only for cutting calories and healthier for me. If you are not cutting calories the regular bacon is great also. It is just a preference. This is such a nice easy recipe to throw together and come home to a house filled with aroma of clam chowder. Add a little french bread to compliment and dunk with and it is a great meal.",
