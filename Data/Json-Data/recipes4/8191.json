However it sounds like this recipe was adapted from a traditional recipe and needs some tweaking for the sous vide technique. First obviously the final product will not reach 165. Ignore that detail. Next individual plastic bags won't work for Ziploc users- more filling would probably end up outside the chicken than in. I rolled each individual breast in plastic wrap making a tight bundle. Then I placed all the bundles into a single gallon-sized Ziploc. It worked great and the rolls cooked completely intact. Finally sous vide chicken looks pretty unappetizing without a stove finish. After cooking I sprinkled some additional cajun seasoning on the outside and browned the rolls on two sides in frying pan. They looked stunning sliced up!",
