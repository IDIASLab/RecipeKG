Next time might follow other users' suggestions and try spinach feta and/or black olives and might add another carrot. Also I might store the leftover rice and salad separately to preserve it better. PS: I just realized the recipe calls for 2 cups uncooked rice; I used 2 cups cooked rice which I thought was perfect.",

I also really love it with a bit of feta cheese and chopped tomatoes; the coolness of the tomatoes with the warm rice and tuna is just divine.
