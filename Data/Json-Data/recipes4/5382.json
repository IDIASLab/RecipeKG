The diced tomatoes and green chilies, fresh basil, fresh mushrooms, and Merlot make this more than an everyday beef stew - it's a gourmet ragout. This is one of those dishes that actually tastes better the next day, after the flavors have had a chance to blend together. If possible, make ahead, refrigerate overnight, then heat and serve the next day. Serve over cooked rice. Enjoy!",

                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe pretty close to the original recipe. I added the merlot earlier in the process..simmered in the skillet after browning the meat with the fresh garlic in order to reduce the wine well and get all those yummy brown bits from the pan. Once reduced I added the broth and then poured all of it over the rest of the ingredients. Other than that I followed the recipe. This recipe makes a very savory and delicious beef and vegetable soup. It really is good but calling it a \"ragout\" is misleading as it is much thinner than a stew. Also I was hoping it would showcase the morel mushrooms but their unique flavor was lost in all the complex spicy favors. Actually after cooking for so many hours you could not really tell them apart from the other ingredients. Since I wanted this to be a ragout not a soup I made a roux and added it in at the end to thicken it up...it worked great. I did serve this with rice as recommended but thought it would also be good over garlic mashed potatoes so I offered both with dinner. A vote was taken and 6 of 6 preferred it over the mashed potatoes. Next time I will omit the potatoes in the ragout and serve over mashed potatoes with the morels saut\u00e9ed seperately and served on top. Serving with crusty French bread to sop up rich sauce is a must! Next time I will also omit most of the broth and maybe some of the tomato sauce as well. Without altering it is soup....a hearty delicious soup. Good base recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "Made this last night. It was great! We had company coming and he requested soup or stew so I did a search of slow cooker recipes and found this. What sold me on trying this recipe was the fact that the author/contributor of this recipe is from Slidell Louisiana. I know this means it must be deliciously spicy with a complex flavor. I was not disappointed! I doubled the recipe on everything except the broth and I also added the whole bottle of wine - half at the beginning and the other half in the last couple of hours of cooking. I had a lot of the flour/Tony's mixture left so near the end of cooking I added some sauce to the flour and stirred until the flour was well blended then added it to the crock pot. This thickened things up a little. In tasting it from the crock pot while cooking it had an almost bitter edge but in eating it with rice - it tasted very different and melded perfectly. Very rich spicy and filling. My guest had three helpings - looking embarrassed at the third trip but getting more anyway. Because I made so much we are freezing part of it and will be eating the rest over the next few days. Thanks so much! Will make again.",

I know top sirloin isn't the norm for a ragout but we needed to use the beef fast and prepare something we could package for the deep freeze. This was a terrific easy recipe and the results were outstanding. Thanks AllRecipe.com for making it so easy to adjust recipe size! Yes as one reviewer stated it is more towards a soup in consistency so we thickened a little it with Tony Chachery's instant roux. Served over rice as recommended makes for a wonderful tummy warming meal. With the six quarts we have now in the deep freeze we'll be enjoying this for a long time!",
