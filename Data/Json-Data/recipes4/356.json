I might cover the dish the last 10 minutes...my pasta got a little crunchy on top - but my husband liked it that way. Will make again for sure!",

I cut the butter to about 3 TBS and used a bit less olive oil too. Since I was making this for a vegetarian friend I eliminated the proscuitto. I added fresh tomatoes along w/ the sun-dried tomatoes. To add a bit of extra flavor I also added some of the herbs in oil from the sun-dried tomato jar. I cooked it for 30 minutes covered and removed the foil for the remaining 10 minutes. It had just enough crispy bits but not too many! Yummy recipe!",

Instead of the sun-dried tomatoes I used fresh grape tomatoes. These being of small size there was no need to chop. Then I used bacon instead of the prosciutto. I browned it first leaving the drippings. Then I added the tomatoes and butter which I decreased to 1/2 cup. This dish is a treat to the taste buds along with the nose.",

I added crushed red pepper flakes some salt and pepper and basil to give it more flavor. I only used 2 tablespoons of butter and I tossed the pasta and veggies with garlic infused olive oil. I did not use meat in this recipe or the sun dried tomatoes. I like the fact you can bake this in the oven so that you don't have to time everything perfectly to get the pasta and veggies hot at the same time and then you don't have to serve immediately the dish stays hotter longer than if you just toss the pasta and veggies together.",

I drained most of the oil out of the jar first but didn't strain the sun dried toms. I can't wait to cook this for company.
