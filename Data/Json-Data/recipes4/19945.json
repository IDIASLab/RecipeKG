The one part of the recipe that nearly ruined these was the \"generous\" rub on the burgers. When I see crusted in the title I think thick rub. If I would have been paying attention I would have realized that the majority of the rub is salt. Needless to say mine were way too salty almost to the point they were inedible which was a shame for how much work and time went into them. Ignore the \"generous\" and use sparingly instead. A light sprinkle on each side of the burger is all that you need.",
