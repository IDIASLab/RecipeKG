I added 2 turkey sausages into the meat mixed and used a little more bread crumbs. Instead of one pack of cream cheese, I used two packets of powdered cheese mix that came with the \"hamburger helper\". I didnt use hamburger helper, I used an organic brand and used two boxes instead of one. I also added some cut onions to the water.  I completly took out the nutmeg and instead added some bays seasoning, thyme, parsley and the salt. I used real garlic instead of powdered then I used a tablespoon of tomato paste along with the a1 sauce. Also, after I cooked the meatballs and the macaroni in the oven. I added a bag full of mixed veggies. Mixed together and added the meatballs on top with Mottzarealla cheese sprinkled over the top and some olive oil.  I let it cook for ten minutes and all done! A delicious meal!  Thanks.",
