Only difference when I make it is I used homemade beef stock and omit the beans/double the kale. This increases well to feed whoever shows up just add more broth and throw in more veggies. Best with a homemade crusty bread or beer bread. NOTE: You can use almost any kind of meatballs you like. I prefer an italian-seasoned meatball that I've made myself with ground chuck and sausage.",
