Oh... and then layer top with breadcumbs and bake. In last 10 minutes add grated cheese on top.",

I also layered the bottom of our dishes with red sauce for flavor contrasts. The combination of the flavors was really good.",

Plus I also didn't use manicotti I just scooped it into homemade crepes (made a day or 2 before) and rolled them up and covered them in the sauce (omitted the water) and baked for about 30 minutes. It was delicious! When I do it again I will most likely use less milk in the sauce as it was pretty runny but my friends loved it. Served it with a spinach salad with warm italian bacon dressing and garlic bread sticks.",
