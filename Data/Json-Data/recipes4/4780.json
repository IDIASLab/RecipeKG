Delicious--I used the coleslaw dressing recipe from \"Simple Coleslaw\" on this site too! Oh and it does make a lot more yogurt sauce then you would probably ever use",

To save time I cooked the corned beef in the crock-pot all day and then shredded the meat before serving. We liked the combination of the yogurt sauce and the coleslaw. This makes way more yogurt sauce than what is needed for the recipe. I easily had enough of the sauce leftover that I could have used it for the slaw dressing instead of regular slaw dressing. I am going to do that the next time I make this recipe. I also added about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper as a dash was not even noticeable. I warmed the tortillas on a griddle so that I could heat more than one at a time. This recipe is repeat worthy - and I tried it just in time to stock up on corned beef that will soon be on sale for St. Patrick's Day.",
