We did use lamb, but I think it would be just as good with beef, however my husband disagrees with me ; )  \nOne change we made is that we only used about half the rutabaga.  Once we got it all chopped it was just so much and didn't look like all that chopped rutabaga belonged in the stew!  We used the fire-roasted tomatoes that the recipe also calls for and I do like some kick to my stews, so we really enjoyed it, but if you don't like spice, then use a can of regular diced tomatoes.\nOne more thing... it needs a bit more juice or water.  Ours was really thick.\nI can see this recipe becoming a family favorite.  Thanks so much for creating it JG!",

I put the salt and pepper into a Ziploc bag with 1/2 cup of flour and shook the meat cubes in it and knocking off the excess before browning in the bacon drippings. I omitted the tomatoes and oregano. I used 1/2 the amount of mushrooms and 1/2 the amount of barley. I used very small baby red potatoes which I left whole rather than cubing. I added 1/2 cup of home-made demiglace when I put in the broth for color and richness. For the thickening slurry at the end I used some of the leftover seasoned dredging flour to mix with the reserved Guinness. 2 tablespoons was enough since the barley has some thickening action. The lamb got so tender most of it fell of the bones making it easier to eat. My girlfriend's mother came to dinner and had seconds which is rare for her. Even with 3 of us eating two servings each we have plenty of leftovers. I will make this again.",
