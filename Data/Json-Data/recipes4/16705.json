The only things keeping it from 5-stars was the masa balls. I cooked them in the soup for a half hour or more but they never really firmed up. My husband picked his out and gave them to me. I found that after they were completely cool they had firmed up. I don't know how they would hold up upon reheating because we didn't have one drop left after dinner! Great recipe. I'll play with the balls a little to make them more firm (Oh my goodness!)",

In addition to increasing the spices and adding corn for crunch, I omitted the chicken and substituted veggie broth since I'm vegetarian. The soup was so good I didn't feel it needed the cheese stirred in or even as a garnish (I did add a little half and half at the end). I took the time to make the yummy masa balls, but they're so similar to hominy corn in texture, I will use those next time instead to cut prep time. (I guess that would make it hominy soup not masa soup! ??) Regardless, this is one of the best soups I've ever made! I'm always happy to find great recipes I can easily convert to meat-free. Thank you for the great recipe!!!",

I followed the recipe as outlined except for sauteing the onion and garlic first then adding the rest of the ingredients (this way I only had to get one pot dirty). I wasn't sure how large to make the masa balls so I googled it. Another recipe recommended the balls be about 1-1/2 inches which worked great and they cooked up fine. Quick notes: the direction to add the shredded chicken isn't actually included. (I can totally imagine myself forgetting this step on busy nights even though it's obviously meant to be added!) Also we live in a very dry climate and had to add more water to the masa ball mixture in order to be able to form the balls. Thanks for the new favorite Liz!",
