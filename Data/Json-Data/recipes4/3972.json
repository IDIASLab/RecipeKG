Luckily I made 8 ounces thinking this was going to be a problem. It was creamy but I couldn't taste the blue cheese at all! It needed garlic too I thought. If the measurements were right then this would be a nice creamy pasta but save your blue cheese for something you can taste it in!

Next time, I will only make one and half times the cheese sauce, because it was a little much for a pound of pasta. I tried it right out of the pan and it is just as delicious as baked.  It is a sophisticated version of mac and cheese that adults and children will love.  The blend of cheeses was perfect and I thought the blue cheese came through beautifully, since sometimes it can be overpowering.  Thanks for the great recipe.  It is going to be a definite keeper for me!",

I added 2 ounces more Velveeta (what isn't better with more Velveeta?), and crushed up some Ritz crackers for the top.  The ratio of macaroni to cheese sauce was perfect, in my opinion, and the bleu cheese and hint of mustard really does make an amazing difference.

I used more onion than called for (like 1/4 cup total) slightly more velveeta (for a more cheesier flavor) and after tasting it and deciding it needed a little something more about 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic. Next time I will use fresh garlic (1-2 cloves) and cook it with the onions. When I first tasted the sauce on it's own I wasn't impressed but once I added the noodles and baked it the flavors melded perfectly. Don't be fooled by the amount of blue cheese used you can definately taste it but in a good way. I will use this recipe again from time to time for something different from the norm!
