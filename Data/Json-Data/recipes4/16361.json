Also used mini semi sweet chocolate chips instead of white again because I had on hand. Instead of making as cupcakes I made a bundt cake instead. Took about 42 minutes to cook. Instead of canned frosting I made a lowfat cream cheese frosting and drizzled it on top. This was super moist and very delicious. I like that it used egg whites and had no added sugar into the recipe as many others did that were similar. I try to keep my cooking on the lighter/lowfat side. Because of the pumpkin you could probably do without adding the oil. I may try that next time.",
