I will definitely make these again. Thanks!:)",

Made them exactly as written and feel there are no changes needed...just the right amount of 'heat', not a hot, spicy heat, just a warm heat that you can feel in the back of your throat....SO YUMMY! The icing is definately the star of these cupcakes, and would go great on a variety of cakes, or from a spoon as I was doing, lol. Even my little guy LOVED these, but he is partial to spicy foods, so I knew that he would be ablr to handle this. Can't wait to share these with my family and friends. Definate repeat recipe!

These were a hit with all the guys for sure... very different but worth a try.. IMO the frosting didn't look too appealing because of the spices so I topped it with caramel sauce to help. Regardless by the time everyone left they had eaten them all gone! They are an adult cupcake I wouldn't recommend these for kids unless they have a eclectic pallet & can tolerate heat.. I will note that I used tofutti non-dairy cream cheese & earth balance butter.",

I amped up the Ancho and Cayenne ground pepper per request to two teaspoons Ancho and 1/2 teaspoon Cayenne in the CC batter. Actually I thought it tasted good and was still not too hot for this wimp. That's why I like this recipe. Make it as you like... less pepper powder or more. Of course I made some for hubby too! He liked the spicer version too.",

I couldn't find ancho chili pepper but a friend brought me dried pasilla chilis which I ground myself. The cupcakes could use a little more heat so don't be afraid to bump up the peppers if you like spicy. I will make them again from scratch. I think a dark chocolate cocoa would be great.",
