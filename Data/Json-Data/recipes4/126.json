I've made quiches before not realizing that you need to cook the pie crust BEFORE you pour the wet egg mixture into it. I was dubious looking at my cooked crusts before adding the filling but this was just wonderful. The egg mixture moistens the crusts to the perfect consistency of soft and flaky. I didn't change a thing either which is unusual for me as I'm a born fiddler and substituter and this says something for the quality and reliability of the recipe. Really good!",

I put this down to the addition of flour and sliced onion rather than applying the French method (from Alsace-Lorraine) and incorporating duxelles into the custard, only takes a few minutes to whip up. Of course as a French women and French Chef I often express my bias for authenticuty. I prefer a French-Gruyere to the Swiss for flavour, and check the bacon for salt before adding it to the recipe. In my quiche I use 8 slices of smoked streaky bacon and 2 eggs and 1 egg yolk and I use double cream rather than milk. An addition of  white pepper is essential. In France chestnuts often replace the mushrooms in the duxelles. Nevertheless my family finished the above pie and enjyed a good Alsace Reisling to accompany. I am still able to spend a month every year to visit my birth-home in Normandy and to eat, drink and converse on food and of course to enjoy the quiche of the region, made with tart apples, cambenbert, local ham and eggs, chestnut and truffle duxelles and creme-fraiche topped with fresh grated nutmeg and all in a beutiful pete-brise and specially knowing that, unlike Canada and the United States, there are no restrictions or additive imposed on the dairy products and flavours to die for. Bon appetite'.",

I added a little bit more salt than the recipe called for-1 teaspoon instead of 1/2 teaspoon. Careful pouring the mixture into the pie shell- it over flows. Probably my lack of experience. Served it with fruit salad. Highly recommend!",
