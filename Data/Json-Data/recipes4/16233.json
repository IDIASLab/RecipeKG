Yummy with just margarine, they are also good with honey or real maple syrup. These pancakes are a good way to add beta-carotene to your day, as well as help the kids get in more veggies.",

I had to use buckwheat flour instead of oat flour and used homemade boiled carrots instead of canned. I didn't understand if the liquid should be used or not, so I pureed the carrots with a little of their liquid, but reserved the rest. I used the carrot liquid instead of water. I think the next time I will add a bit of brown sugar to the batter. Thank you for the lovely gluten free recipe.",
