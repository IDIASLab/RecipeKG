I poked the steak with a fork all over, laid it in a shallow dish & poured enough marinade to cover the top & overflow a little & rubbed it in. In 15 minutes I flipped it over & did the same to the other side. I only used half the marinade so I could let my husband use the rest for basting the last few minutes on the grill. This was sooo good I told my husband he needn't take me out to steakhouses (my absolute favorite!!) anymore - he can just grill our own at home!! We used T-bone steaks. I used about 1/8 c. balsamic and the rest white wine vinegar because I ran out of the balsamic. Both our company & us ate til' we couldn't eat anymore only because it was so good!! I served with salad, Grilled Corn on the Cob (also on this site), Greek Chicken Pasta (without the chicken - also on this site), & garlic bread. MmmMmm Good!!",

Well he loved it and now we are eating bottom sirloin on a regular basis. I used freshly sliced onions in place of onion powder and I ommited the liquid smoke. I found that if I put everything in a ziploc bag there is enough marinade for 4 or 5 steaks. I also score my steaks in a diagonal grid pattern on each side before I marinade them. This makes them really tender.",

I was a little concerned that the relatively large amount of basalmic vinegar would make the steaks too tangy or \u201csour\u201d tasting, but instead, I was very pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of this simple, yet extremely tasty marinade.  Following the recipe exactly as written, the marinade did not overpower the inherent flavor of the steak, but rather complimented it very, very nicely, in perhaps a bit more subtle way than you might think.   Be sure to use a good, *non*-\u201clight\u201d variety of basalmic, soy sauce, and olive oil (note: not extra-virgin style), as this is essentially the base of the marinade.  Liquid smoke is perfect in the amount it is originally called for.  Any more than that, and it has a chance of taking over the flavor that was intended by this recipe.  Highly Recommended as its original author intended!",
