Enough steam escapes from the fibers so that you aren't \"steaming\" it (like in an oven bag) but roasting it. I chunked up some potatoes carrots and onions and roasted them in the bag w/ the chicken. I also put a little crunched up aluminum foil under the bottom of the bird as a make-shift rack so the juices would settle on the pan. I added fresh rosemary to the thyme and stuffed the bird with lemon wedges onion and the fresh herbs. Topping it with the lemon slices is a great way for it to self baste. It is incredibly moist and flavorful. I used the juices to make a quick gravy. Drain the bird and pour off the pan juices. I added 1/2 cup water b/c I see it was very lemony. I added fresh rosemary no salt was needed. Heated it up on med-low added cornstarch (cornstarch mixed with a little water) and stirred til thick. It was a skoosh over-lemony so I added a small pat of butter to cut the flavor. That did the trick! And yes - the skin looks gross b/c it's not browned...but I don't eat the skin anyway...so it was fine by me. Be sure to let the chicken sit at least 15 minutes before slicing into else the juices won't run back into the meat. Great recipe!",

I generously seasoned the outside and cavity with salt pepper and garlic powder. I didn't have the thyme so I just left that out. Next time I will probably use rosemary though. I loved the addition of lemon. The flavour was really mild yet there just enough. All in all wonderful dinner. Thank you for sharing this recipe:)",

I substituted freash basil for thyme because it is what I had and I added a bit of olive oil to the stuff I rubbed all over it to disperse the basil and garlic and make it all stick well. I also added some salt to the outside skin. It turned out beautifuly moist and I think many variations on stuffing and spices would be possible. The parchment paper makes it stay moist but you will also notice that it doesn't brown attractively. This didn't bother us since we don't eat the skin anyway but browing/braising it for 20-30 mins opened at the end would help.",
