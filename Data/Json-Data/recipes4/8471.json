Sweating or weeping is salting it and letting it sit for 30 min . It makes it more tender and less bitter. I only used one eggplant but 1 lb of turkey....it still makes a LOT. I added mushrooms and cooked them first also because they produce a lot of water if you don't.  If you omit the quinoa it's far less carbs, but quinoa is good for you. You do NOT need to cook the quinoa first.",
