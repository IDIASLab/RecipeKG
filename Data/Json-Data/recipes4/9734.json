Right before I added the flour I added a splash of white wine and let it simmer for 1 min. I then used 1 can of pre-cooked wild rice (drained & rinsed) used only 1/2 tsp of salt and added 2 chicken breasts cooked and cubed small. Finally I only needed 4c of milk. I think this could used some shredded carrots for color but a wonderful tasting soup that everyone loved. I highly recommend this soup and I'll be sure to make it many times to come!

I had thought it was from 'joy of cooking' but it wasn't and decided to search for it. Finding this recipe. It was perfect. I ended up using canned wild rice 2 cups worth because my own wild rice burned (use the directions on the bag for the wild rice) and I used an extra tablespoon of flour and only 4 cups of water. It froze wonderfully and even my extremely picky boyfriend loved it and father told me to 'make sure we keep that recipe'. I think next time I'll try substituting half & half for half of the milk as I remember that that is how I'd been told it was made before.",

The flavor of the milk completely overpowered everything else. I love cream soups and I LOVE wild rice but I couldn't even really taste the flavor of the rice because the milk took over everything. I added carrots garlic and mushrooms to the veggies at the beginning. If I were to make this again I would replace half the milk with vegetable broth to cut the milk taste and add some flavor. Also agree that the salt quantity is too high-i did reduce that. As a side note the leftover soup thickened up considerably and created kind of a creamy veggie rice-nice base/side for our leftover Thanksgiving turkey.",
