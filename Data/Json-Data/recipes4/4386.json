However everyone else who ate them also commented multiple times how much they enjoyed them. I didn't have lettuce or celery (we were camping...too lazy to deal w/fresh produce. And I hate celery.) and they were still awesome. I just prepped another batch to freeze for later grilling. In the latest batch I added some minced garlic and parmesan cheese to attempt to recreate our favorite wing sauce (garlic parmesan) taste. I did freeze them prior to grilling as they are quite wet and I imagine would have been a little annoying to deal w/on the grill w/out freezing first. THANKS for a fantastic recipe (one that made me expand my horizons and try ground chicken at that!)! EDIT: The addition of minced garlic and grated parmesan cheese was awesome! We loved them as written and tweaked to mimic our favorite wing flavors. If we're out of dry blue cheese I'll use a little light ranch mixed some hot sauce for a topper instead. These are now ALWAYS in our freezer for quick meals. When we don't have buns I serve them on Lender's frozen bagels (toasted).",

Added a little minced onion and garlic powder to the blue cheese crumbles with mayo & sour cream 1/2 & 1/2 of each for a creamy texture. Let that sit in the refrigerator for about 1/2 hour. Prepared the meat as directed leaving out the celery salt and let them rest for about 1/2 hour in the refrigerator to all the seasons to mingle. Toasted up the buns after grilling the burger; served with extra hot sauce & blue cheese dressing on the side... It was perfect. Thanks for sharing! Will be a summer hit.",

We did not use the blue cheese crumbles but took a short cut with blue cheese dressing mainly because the kids took one look at real blue cheese and went \"Ewe\". so bottled dressing was the next best thing. The celery is key to these burgers and I mixed it with the bottled blue cheese dressing to hold together and not fall out of the sandwich. Also you HAVE TO watch the cooking time on these as they can get dry quickly. Ours were fine but another minute on one or two of them would have been too much. I might add a bit of EVOO to the next batch and see if that makes any difference. These were a hit with everyone and will now be a regular at our house! Update Have made these several times now! I grind boneless thigh meat and breast meat in my food processor and the result is a very moist patty! I make enough to freeze for 2 additional meals.",

I made my own poultry seasoning (thyme rosemary marjoram sage black pepper) and used 1/3 C Frank's Red Hot sauce since we like the taste. Also I combined ground turkey and chicken. I also added some onion powder garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. I started them on a griddle pan and finished them in the oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes; I served them on buns with low-fat Swiss cheese (less fat than the blue cheese sauce although that looked yummy!).

I added a handful of the chicken cubes to the food processor and hit the chop button for about 5 seconds or so scooped out the ground chicken into a bowl and continued until I had all the chicken ground. Be careful not to grind too long as you can easily ruin the chicken. I then proceeded with the recipe and it yielded 4 patties. Easy recipe and would be great to make ahead and freeze.

We did grill them they seemed really sticky when I pattied them up which I did two hours before grilling so I put them in the freezer on wax paper to make them easier on the grill. The dressing is what makes these so good I followed the ingredients as specified except used celery seed instead of celery salt. Didn't put any real celery on them just Romaine lettuce. Oh and I did mince some sweet onion and put in them honestly they might have been boring without the onion. The sauce was so good and I made extra and we used it as dressing on a salad side dish I did add 2 teaspoons of light mayo and the sour cream and blue cheese were all low fat...couldn't tell the difference. Very good low fat meal.",
