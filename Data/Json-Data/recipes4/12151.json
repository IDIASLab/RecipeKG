I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 C of brown sugar and used some whole peppercorns instead of ground pepper.  I also added a bit of baking soda to the mixture to neutralize the acidity of the oranges and lemons; this helps the brine absorb into the meat better.  I dry the bird after removing from the brine and get it into the oven right away; this ensures the brine stays in the meat.  The weight of the food on itself begins to squeeze the brine out within minutes of leaving the bath.  I've used this brine many times and I'm never disappointed.  Works well for whole birds or pieces.  Thanks!",
