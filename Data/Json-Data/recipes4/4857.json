I used my own breadcrumbs, added some onion powder and italian seasoning to the dry mix, and instead of egg, I used 1 T.avocado oil and 1 T apple cider vinegar to dip the zucchini in. It took about 30 minutes for them to cook- I cooked them about 10 min. on broil after the original time so they would be crispy. My daughter LOVED them! I will be making these again- they were so much more enjoyable than frying them!",

I've made them several times but this last time I used panko bread crumbs and seasoned them myself. I also used olive oil. Delicious! I dip them in ketchup but my husband likes them in honey mustard. I bet some ranch dressing would be tasty for a dip too! Great way to eat up all the zucchini my mom is giving me from her garden. And since they're healthier than your normal fries I'm calling them Bikini Zucchini Fries!",

If I try this again I will REALLY shake off the excess coating (had I coated the fries less I would have rated this recipe higher). I didn't have Italian seasoned bread crumbs so I used regular and added italian seasoning. I used 3 zucchini's so tripled the recipe to have enough mixture. I would recommend adding the breading mixture to pie plate as needed. the butter/marg makes it clumpy so the final fries are hard to coat. I also made the Garlic Ailoli and added roasted red pepper for dipping.",

I might add that I have fried the zucchini in the past and now that I've tried oven baked I prefer it this way.  \n\nI did modify the recipe slightly.  I like the spear shape better, so I cut 2 zucchini in half to make shorter spears (left seeds in since they were not big), then each half was divided into 8 spears.  I used 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese and 2/3 cup Panko crumbs (instead of bread crumbs) and I added garlic salt and lemon pepper to taste (didn't measure, just added then tasted to see if I added enough - start with less then you think you need, add more if wanted).  I scrambled 2 eggs to dip the zucchini into instead of butter before coating them with my crumbs, but used a little butter to grease my foil since I didn't have any cooking spray. I baked mine for 25 mins (I like them crispy!) @ 425 in a convection toaster oven (didn't even bother turning them) and they came out perfect. I had to bake them in 2 batches because my oven is small. But still this was easier on me than deep frying because you don't have to stand over the stove monitoring the frying process and I was able to get more spears into my oven than I could have fit in a frying pan.  Will be doing this again SOON.",
