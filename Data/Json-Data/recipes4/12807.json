It has evolved over the years, with additions, changes, or whatever my mood is.  I now use EVOO and fat-free Italian dressing to equal roughly 1/4 cup (percentage of each is up to your personal tastes)  I have tossed in asparagus, sunflower seeds, and completely switched to black beans about 4 years ago.   The best thing some groceries have ever come up with for a busy working person are chopped veggies, and I have used my share of diced onions, and peppers from the grocery.  I also used the precooked brown rice the last time, worked GREAT!    I had an over abundance of cherry tomatoes last year, and halved a big handful and tossed them in.  Ditto with extra Mini Pearl (grape tomatoes from Trader Joes), those go in whole. I have been known to toss in diced ham or chicken if the carnivores were descending. Happy cooking, and ENJOY!",

With the addition of carrots, it would have every color in the rainbow (except blue, of course!) and it tastes even better than it looks! I didn't add the mushrooms, because I didn't have any, and I also doubled the amount of salad dressing, because it was a little bland. With these changes, the salad is absolutely fantastic and so healthy! I will definitely make this again; thanks for sharing!",

I used to work in a coffee house that sold a sunflower-seed-longrain rice salad that I loved, and this recipe is almost EXACTLY the same! I followed the recipe as stated and added shredded carrot and sliced green onion to it. I didn't have any beans, but the salad was just fine without them - although I will try adding chick peas in the future. I used Kraft Golden Italian dressing, and like other reviewers, added MUCH more than the recommended 2 tbsp...I added over 5 tbsp ;P But it's really up to the individual - if you like more dressing, then this recipe allows you to add more without ruining the combined flavours :) My family like this recipe so much that I had to make ANOTHER batch the next day! And my hubby suggested I make this salad for upcoming family functions :) I will continue making this salad, especially during the summer when I like eating lighter :P",

It's pretty good. I can't decide how I feel about it but Mr. LTH liked it! It's most def worth trying!!! I had it for lunch and thought it was ok. Then for dinner I added a splash of banana pepper juice and a shake of parm cheese (I would have chopped up some banana peppers and added them too but I'm lazy) and that really made a difference for me! I will prob make again as it is a very nutrient dense all-in-one side! Thanks for a unique recipe (and thanks to LARKSPUR for mentioning it on the RE!)!",
