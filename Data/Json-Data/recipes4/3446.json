So I dropped it to 1 egg and 1/4 cup milk.  I elected to use grapeseed oil as it has a higher heat tolerance. I used a mix of Italian seasoned Panko and Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, instead of all heavy cream (and to save calories) I used a mix of 1% milk & heavy whipping cream using a 3:1 ratio.  I used a 6 cheese Italian blend and I left out the salt - the proscuitto is MORE than salty enough.  Once the chicken was finished I kept it warm in the oven. Other than that there were no other changes.  I used barefoot pinot grigio as it's a good quality white wine.  Next time I'll toss in some fire roasted bell peppers.  This is a \"dining in\" dinner and a keeper!",
