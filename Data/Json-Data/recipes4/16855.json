This recipe is fabulous, but it makes a LOT...way more than 4 servings.  Unless you are planning on eating nothing but rice for dinner this could easily feed 8 as a side or as a burrito filler instead of the stated four people.  To give it extra zing, zest the lime and add that as well.  Be careful though, as a little goes a long way.  It was perfect with chicken enchiladas.  This is going in my keeper box....it's just too bad that only 1/2 of my family likes cilantro and lime!",

I have been making my rice in a rice cooker, and I think the texture is even better than cooking it on the stove top. I don't know if it's really true, but my rice cooker changed my opinion of brown rice. I love it now!  I love going to Chipotle for this rice, and now I can make it any time at home.

I used Young Elephant's Brown Jasmine Rice and surprisingly had no problems with the rice being mushy! I followed the cooking directions on the back of the bag which was for every 1 cup rice use 1.5 cups water in a rice cooker. Several reviews complain about mushy rice so definitely refer to the mfr. recommended cooking method. Most long grain brown rice calls for 2 cups water p/1 cup rice which I've always had problems making on the stove. When using those such as Riceland brand I find Alton Brown's baked brown rice method yields fluffy brown rice every time. Try baking the rice first using his method continue with the rest of this recipe and you won't be disappointed. Thanks for sharing the recipe! UPDATE: 2.9.18-Had about 2.5 cups leftover baked brown rice made this recipe again using a tad more lime juice and about 2 tsp dried cilantro (1st time using this not bad but prefer fresh). Added a little chicken broth to reheat brown rice in oven to prevent it drying out. Stirred all to combine covered with foil bake at 350 F for 20 minutes. Recipe worked perfect for us tonight! Thanks again!",
