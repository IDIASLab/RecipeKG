I didn't do the precise measuring but just mixed the liquids then added the Ricotta then the cake mix and it came out fabulous. I did add a tsp of vanilla which added a nice little pop of flavor. No need to frost and definitely get the crushed pineapple that's in its own juice not sweetened in any way. Also use REAL ricotta not low cal or diet. The muffins loose texture if you sub in the fake stuff.",
