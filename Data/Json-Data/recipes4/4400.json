I take the block of tofu out and place it on a plate. I take a second plate on place it on top of the block of tofu. Then get a can of bean or corn or whatever is handy that had some weight, and place that on top of the second plate. Wait for 20-25 min, and dump the water. Hope this helps I know when I first cooked with tofu I had to research and research. This was yummy by the way, we like spicy food so I added a jalapeno and it came delish!",

I did have to make changes though-  I didn't have red curry powder, so I used curry powder plus some red chile paste instead.  I added extra garlic, garlic powder and onion powder, and some black pepper.  i think this is a bit bland in flavor, but with additional seasonings, it's a great recipe.  And it sure is a lot healthier than the tofu burgers that are at the store. I may add some shredded carrot to this next time, I think it would work out pretty well.  Oh-  and VERY important--  you MUST drain your tofu ahead of time.  I wrap it up in a clean kitchen towel, then place it between two plates, and put something heavy on top.  Let it sit for 25-20 minutes, to squeeze that water out.  Also...   make sure you use QUICK COOK oats---  not the 5 minute cook oats.  The quick cook (i.e. cooks in 1 minute), has no problem in getting the batter to stick together.  That being said, this is a nice recipe for healthy homemade tofu burgers...  just add extra spices and try some different things.   We added a bit of hot sauce, when eating, and it tasted great that way!  Another one to try, is a little bit of cheese (maybe some pepper jack?).",

I followed the advice to drain the tofu: the technique I used was to crumble both packages of firm tofu into a colander set the colander in a bowl to catch the drainage press another bowl into the tofu that was sitting in the colander and set a gallon water bottle on the bowl to exert weight onto the tofu. Left it in the 'fridge overnight and it was quite dry in the morning. Besides the recipe ingredients I added a finely-diced carrot and half bell pepper. Finely-diced cauliflower or broccoli would be good too. Used cumin seeds instead of ground cumin; and about 4 T. cumin paste instead of one. For the binder I started with 3 eggs instead of the 2 eggs called for and pan-fried 4 tofu patties. Was still crumbly so I added 2 more eggs for 5 total. This seemed to improve the cohesiveness of the cooked burgers. Had to use a spatula to transfer the patties to the frying pan as the egg doesn't bind the patty together until it's cooked. (But you knew that.:-) My total yield was 14-15 patties. Thanks for the awesome recipe!",
