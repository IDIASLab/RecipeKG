For us it was a nice change of pace as a side dish. I made very minor changes - halved the recipe shells not elbows and diced tomatoes instead of whole. Otherwise I made it as written. It could use some salt and pepper maybe but then again the simple flavors of the tomatoes and cheese were kind of nice not overpowered by a lot of other seasonings. I can see making this again.",
