Some liberties were taken with ingredients: frozen spinach was replaced with fresh steamed spinach; rice wine vinegar was used instead of red wine vinegar (none in house). Like others the amount of vinegar was cautiously monitored by taste but the measurement came out to a little less than what was listed. This recipe is a keeper. It turned out to be a great appetizer and we'll use it in the future for a side dish.",
