My family says they could go for this every couple of weeks or so - I'm going to try on boneless skinless chicken thighs, too.  ** I used a light catalina dressing, and it didn't lose any flavor.",

I did not have the 1oz. of onion soup mix (but according to other reviews I didn't want that 'overpowering flavor' competing). I did however use 1 T. of dried onion and 1 t. onion powder. My bottle of russian dressing was only 10oz. The sauce this makes tastes so very wonderful (sweet and sour chinese like) over my rice cooker's sticky rice! IF my husband and son weren't opposed I would of added onions mushrooms and maybe bell pepper diced into the 'gravy' and let the flavors meld in the oven. This recipe is number one on the 'super easy to put together' list for sure!!! Thanks for submitting this recipe it will go into the mix for future use.:)",
