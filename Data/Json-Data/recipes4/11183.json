I left the anise out of the rub and used spiced rum instead of dark rum but otherwise left the recipe as is. I served it over basmati rice w/steamed green beans that I then sauteed w/a little olive oil and slivered almonds. I can't say enough great things about this meal. The sauce thickened up really nicely and had a great flavor over the spiced chicken. I will definitely make this again and again. (Oh I also baked the chicken as I live in a condo and cannot have a grill - it was still delicious). Thanks Linda!",

I rubbed then marinated the chicken longer than the recipe indicated about 3 hours which brought out the flavor and also added salt for added flavoring.

I put the dry rub on first then patted in some fresh ginger and let marinade. I cooked this on the Foreman Grill for 6 minutes and perfection. The sauce was really good too I added a little bit more honey than called for.......Very easy and yummy!! Thanks for a great recipe I will make this again.",
