I fixed that though by scraping all the crumbles into a ziploc bag and then forming it into a ball -- super results and little mess that way too. Put the Ziploc in the freezer for about an hour and then rolled it out b/t sheets of wax paper like I remember Mom doing........makes the transfer to the Pie pan easy too. Lots of little tips here - but I am an \"ease\" baker!!",

After the crust is cooked it is so crumbly it seems to just melt in your mouth! I used this recipe with Grandma Ople's Apple Pie that's also on this website and it is an amazing combination! Although at first I too had problems with the crust being too crumbly but I found out that all you have to do is mix in the Crisco (I use butter flavored Crisco as well) a bit and then shake shake SHAKE! If you don't shake it long or fast enough for whatever reason it won't turn out how it's supposed to. I actually get quite a workout when I shake mine. _",

But I shook and I shook and it was still super-crumbly and I had to form a ball with my hands. I refrigerated it while I made my filling but it was still too crumbly to roll. So I formed it into the pan with my hands. I was surprised that once it was baked the pie crust was very yummy. It had a buttery-flavor because I used butter flavored Crisco. Maybe I will give this one another chance.",
