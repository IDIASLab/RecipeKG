I dumped in a whole box of spaghetti and THEN read the dish called for just 6 ounces of it. I couldn't find creamed spinach and so used chopped instead The result is spaghetti with chunks of tomato and spinach and it was really good, and even better the second day around. I will certainly try this recipe again, if only to see what happens when I actually follow the directions. :)",
