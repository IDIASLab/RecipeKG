Since my sausage was already fully cooked I browned it and removed it from the pan. Then I proceeded with the pepper ragout. After adding the marinara and wine I simmered the sauce for only about 10 minutes so the peppers wouldn t turn to mush. Then I added back the sausage and heated through. Very good and with the mix of bell peppers very colorful.",
