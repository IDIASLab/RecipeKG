I didn't use the corn or chilis. I used Rotel tomatoes instead. Since making it the first time I have made it numerous times but added my own touches. I still use the Rotel tomatoes but have also added a 6 oz. can of tomato paste. I also use black beans instead of kidney beans. This chili has the perfect amount of heat. My children who do not like chili will not eat this but that means it's just more for the adults.",
