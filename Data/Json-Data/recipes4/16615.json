                "reviewBody": "Shocked. Very recent vegetarian again. I've never had a 'meatless' burger before. I didn't expect it to be bad but I did not expect to like it as much as I do. Great texture and good taste. Love the garlic! My 11 year old omnivore son ate the whole thing and enjoyed it. I varied a little from the recipe as I have an abnormal physical and neurological response to Corn Soy and Wheat. I was out of white onions so I used 4 green onions. Due to my issues I can't have over-the-counter mustard so I added mustard powder and apple cider vinegar. I also added a tablespoon of Chili Powder because I like Chili powder. Right at the end I added some coconut oil to the pan and the top of the burgers to give it some sizzle and buttery goodness. I used Arrowroot starch and Cassava flour in equal portions instead of 'baking flour'. The starch really helped to make definite patties this gets you a thicker texture and not a 'loose burger' like you might get with just flour. Like another review mentioned I used about 3x more of the flour/starch than the recipe called for. The texture held up great on a bun and it was chewy enough to make you feel like you were eating a hamburger. My goal was not to reproduce the Hamburger taste but to have a reliable protein that is portable and easy to eat. Next day it reheated well. I just ate it for lunch with some home-made mayo and tomato slice.",

The recipe definitely would have benefited from the mustard though. Probably due to the lack of mustard, my mixture turned out a nice texture without adding flour. Next time, and there WILL be a next time, I will saute my onions in the pan before adding the water, lentils, and spices. I must also remind myself to mince my onions very finely!",
