This is not a 5 star for a couple of reasons. First off b/c of all the cheese chicken broth (low sodium at that) and mayonnaise this was nearly too salty. Second for our tastes it was way too rich. I think next time I will half the Velveeta and add low fat milk instead. Also we topped it off with about a T of bacon did not use any of the grease. It was very pretty with the carrots and red bell peppers and the celery was a nice touch. All in all a great winter time stick to your bones soup recipe.",
