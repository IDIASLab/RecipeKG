I actually added and extra 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, added no salt, and used turkey bacon.  Perfect.  I pureed about 3/4 of the soup.      When I was in the grocery store purchasing the leeks a woman told me to soak the leeks because they contain \"sand\".  I thought she was nuts but I did soak the leeks for about 10 minutes and sure enough, there was sand at the bottom of the bowl! Not sure if this is true for all leeks but you may want to chop the leeks and then soak before using.      Thanks for the recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "I made a few adjustments so that I could cook this soup mostly in my crockpot. I doubled the recipe and threw the potatoes in the crockpot with the organic chicken broth and additonal sauteed onion/few cloves of minced garlic and a few spices. I cooked that on high for an hour then low for the rest of the day. Before adding everything else I lightly mashed the potatoes with the broth with a potato masher then added the bacon the sauteed leeks onion celery and also some minced garlic carrot and diced bell peppers. I steamed the broccoli on the side in additional organic broth so that the broccoli would not get mushy and I folded that in with just a bit of the milk called for to cut down on the fat (I also used fat free evaporated milk). I thought at the last minute that using the last cup or so of leftover Christmas ham would be a good addition as well. I don't care for herbes de provence so I just threw in what I thought would be good. I also didn't need that much pepper or salt. I just added until it tasted right. A good potato soup recipe is easily adaptable to whatever you want to add in really. A doubled recipe made more than enough for at least a week's worth of lunches/dinners for me and will provide quite a few portioned out for the freezer. It was quite easy to adapt this for the crockpot which I appreciated. This was an excellent way for me to use the surplus of potatoes broccoli and ham that I had leftover in my fridge.",
