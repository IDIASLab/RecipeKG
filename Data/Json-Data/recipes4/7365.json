Then I heated another small batch of the butter and hot sauce mixture and drizzled that instead of the plain hot sauce. Blue cheese dipping sauce on the side. Huge hit.",

I used Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage rather than the ground chicken and these were just so yummy that I couldn't stop eating them. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. I do think that I would prefer cooking them on stovetop rather than in the oven because I think they need to be turned often. As written they were done in 15 minutes in the oven. I would make these again. Let them cool before trying to put a toothpick in them because they will fall apart if done before. Thanks mmaronic!",

I baked a lot longer hoping to firm them up - which worked to an extent... but then the second day leftovers were perfect. I was worried about them being bland so I added red pepper and a lot more sauce (Frank's hot buffalo sauce) and drizzled before baking. Mistake. We love love love spicy food (we would order a 10 out of 10 spicy at a Chinese restaurant) - but we all agreed... it destroyed it. So that's my fault... never again... but the flavor behind the heat was very good and we will definitely have these again. Thanks so much!",
