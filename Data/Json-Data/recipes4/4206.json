Frozen tater tots, onions and vegetables are coated in a sour cream/condensed soup sauce with meatloaf pieces pressed into the surface. A cheese topping keeps the meatloaf moist during cooking and adds crispness, but ketchup or french-fried onions could also be used.",

I didn't change anything in the recipe. It was so so good. Perfectly creamy, not mushy, meatloaf was still moist, and the leftovers reheated well. My husband (super picky eater) and 21mo. Old son LOVE it. Try it, you will not be disappointed! It's like the most comforting cafeteria food(in a good way, like back in the day when the food quality standards were higher) that tastes just the way you would expect. I can't say enough JUST MAKE IT!",

The only thing I may alter next time is the cooking time. I only needed to cook it for about 35 minutes total as the cheese got too hard on top. Note: This is also a heavier meal so serve it up with some light side items like salad or apple sauce etc. YUM!",

I did cube up the leftover meatloaf and folded it into the sauce ingredients and I used Crispy Crowns instead of tater tots. I DID NOT TRY THIS MYSELF--but my three boys ate the whole thing in one sitting. My husband is STILL talking about this almost a week later. I thought it was pretty amazing because a) this used leftover meatloaf in a new way and b) this recipe called for all ingredients I had on hand.
