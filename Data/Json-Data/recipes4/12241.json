The recipe handled it just fine and I didn't need to add extra flour at all. Also don't cut the potatoes too thin (as I did) or they come out a little mushy. Cut maybe 1/4 inch thin.",

I just sprinkled a pinch of  \nthyme on each layer -also plenty...Instead of beef boullion and water, (allergic to MSG) I poured a cup of chicken broth over the top. 1/4 C. butter seemed like too much too. I dotted the layers with several dabs of   Smart Balance (butter substitute). I was already to make the gravy after I took the casserole out of the oven, but after removing pork and potatoes to serving dish, the dripping were already thick enough to pour on the chops.",

I can't eat cheese, so the other scalloped potato and pork recipes don't work for me, but this was is perfect.  I scaled it back for two pork chops, and I used beef stock instead of the beef bouillon and water.  I took two pork chops out of the freezer and thawed them, and then my husband, who had packaged them for the freezer, told me that I had taken out turkey breasts or tenderloins.  But, I made the recipe anyway, and it is very good with turkey.  Next time I will make it with pork. The gravy was excellent! I served it with green beans and Irresistible Soda Bread--easy and nutritious meal.",
