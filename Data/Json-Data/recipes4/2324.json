And I used spicy horseradish mustard rather than the yellow mustard!! I made a little dipping sauce with mayo, spicy horseradish mustard and relish too.  YUMMY!!

I used less mayo as suggested and added a little cajun seasoning and parsley as well as adding a little Italian breadcrumbs. I did pan-fry (with very little oil) to get them brown and then popped them in the oven to cook through though I think next time I'll just bake them from the start and try using half the crackers and half breadcrumbs. I might also add an egg to the mix to help bind the ingredients better.",
