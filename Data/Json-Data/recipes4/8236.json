Almost makes me wonder if that s a typo? I scaled this recipe down to 3 servings and it then called for 1 Tbsp of red pepper flakes. I used 1/2 tsp and still got the kick. Cauliflower is very mild in flavor and unless you adjust the red pepper flakes in this recipe I suspect all you ll taste is the heat and not the cauliflower or the cheese. I steamed the cauliflower in the microwave on high for 2 minutes used Italian panko crumbs and was quite happy with the way this ultimately turned out.",

Put the sauce on the florets then back in the oven for about 8 min. The sauce coated it nicely without being runny or watery. Hubby and I both had seconds of it just by itself it was so good.",
