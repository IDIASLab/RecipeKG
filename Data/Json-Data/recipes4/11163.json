I made this exactly as is tho I don't recall if I used fresh or frozen blueberries. I agree that it's a bit on the tart side but I perhaps don't mind tart as much as the first reviewer but I also think cutting the concentrate back to 4-5 oz would help. It tasted an awful like a grape slushy and I think would be a great way to get fruit into kids. It's a tad on the sweet side (yes a sweet tart) and even though pretty good nothing special so I doubt I'd make too often. I think it would fare best when it's really hot out.",
