I was surprised at how crunchy the jalapenos were--not necessarily a bad thing but I think next time I will cook them for longer or precook the jalapenos. The filling seemed a little thick and I couldn't taste the pineapple as much as I was hoping to so next time I will add more than 1/2 a cup. We used small jalapenos and ended up making a T-cut along the side (where the top of the T is at the base of the stem) because we didn't think we could get all the seeds out just by slicing off the top. I think it worked well--we could hold the jalapenos by the stem to eat them.",

The wow factor was good too with my guests lovong the little treats and asking for the recipe. That's the wonderful part. The weird part was the time it took and my own failure to use the inverted aluminum cooking pan set up properly I guess. It takes a very long time to core out each individual pepper and get them stuffed. Then I put them in the inverted pan with little x-shaped holes cut out so they could stand up. Looked great. Unfortunately as they cook they soften and shrink (duh) and 6-8 of them slid right off onto the bottom of the oven which caused a nice amount of smoke as you can imagine. Definitely make sure they are very snug in their little holes and I would put the inverted aluminum holder on top of a cookie sheet if I ever make them again. They were definitely more work then I expected but the taste and wow factor were great.",

Instead of adding bacon bits to the cheese mixture I wrapped a lean piece of bacon around the top half of the pepper and secured it with a toothpick. I used my fingers to stuff the peppers using a spoon would have taken even longer. To bake them I put a double layer of foil across the deep pan and poked small holes in the foil then pushed the pepper through just to where the bacon was. The tooth pick helped to keep the pepper upright. They were a big hit on \"Game Night\"",
