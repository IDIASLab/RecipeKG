The dough took far more flour than the recipe stipulated, and sure enough, the resultant dumplings tasted bland and floury.  After doing some research, I discovered what was causing the problem.  Overcooking the potatoes!  If they are overcooked, they will absorb more flour, sink to the bottom of the pot like lumps of something you don't wanna eat, and come out floury and tasteless.  Just cook the potatoes until a knife will easily go through them, but don't let them cook so long that they start falling apart.  Then, when you mash them, I'd recommend adding garlic salt and your favourite Italian herbs.  I served ours with a home-made Primavera sauce, and next time I'll serve it with a creamy bacon/shallot sauce.  Yes, there will be a next time, and I'll be sure and not overcook the potatoes!",

Theoretically holds the sauce a bit better...\r\n\r\ntry this just with butter and sage too, delicious.",

Also, they recommended using only enough flour to make the mixture come together.**My entire family including my little boys love gnocchi.  I gave this recipe 4 stars because my recipe is a little different (and I love my recipe!).  I use 2 cups flour instead of 1 and no olive oil.  I do add parmesan cheese (at least 3 Tbsp).  As for potatoes, I use 4 large baking potatoes.  I have mashed my potatoes in many different ways and have found the best way is to use a potato ricer.  It was well worth the investment (I think it was about $30) since my family loves this meal.  Thanks for the posting!",

In fact everyone said it was so much better than the restaurant and the store bought gnocchis because the store bought gnocchis are too chewy). I think all the ingredients need to be doubled (EXCEPT the potatoes) to make this recipe work. I do like adding in the olive oil...makes the gnocchi more tender for sure! I also added in minced garlic dried herbs and replaced salt for GARLIC salt. It was topped with a creamy pesto and grilled chicken...so yummy! The work is super tedious but well worth it when you see the reactions from your guests and your family!",

While smashing my potatoes I added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp garlic powder along with a bit of pepper. This is just personal preference. As other reviewers have mentioned.. make sure you cook your potatoes just right. They should be tender not mushy. Too much or too little flour correcting your potato problem will ruin your efforts.",
