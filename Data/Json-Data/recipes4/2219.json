It keeps all that wonderful filling in the chops where it belongs.  Instead of using toothpicks to hold the pockets close, use a piece of spaghetti, it falls apart when the chops are done.  Browned the chops on the stovetop, then placed in the oven at 325 for 45-60 minutes.  Made a pan sauce with browned bits by adding 1/2 cup of white wine, chicken stock and 1 tbls cold butter.",

For the filling I did as others sugg and added in alittle of cream cheese and a spoonful or two of sourcream(had both on hand)to hold together better.  Also I added in some diced garlic & onion, and fresh parmesan and did half feta and half blue cheese.  This is a perfect filling to just go in the fridge and use up things you have left over and need to use up.  I stuffed into butterflied bone-in pork chops since that's the ones I bought and dipped them in flour and fried in olive oil to brown on each side and baked covered for 40 minutes or so.  Very good.",

I had then in the oven for 40 mins and used skewers to hold the sides together. Will definitely make this one again!",

My fiance is not a huge fan of blue cheese and thought they were decent but I doubt I will make this recipe again. I would be willing to give it another shot if I used swiss and cream cheese to make up for the blue cheese. If you LOVE blue cheese you might love these but if you're on the fence keep looking.",
