I had researched the Top Secret version and felt I could even drop fat content on that one too.\r\n\r\n1.  I used hot italian turkey sausage.  Yes it came in links, but I squeezed out the meat and cooked it.  Then roll in paper towels to get out any remaining fat.  \r\n\r\n2.  Bacon and Onion should be cooked separately, then blended in at the last minute to meld flavors.\r\n3. I dropped the water content, got rid of the cream and used entirely fat free half and half from the dairy section. Brilliant stuff and works well in this recipe.  Smooth, rich, not too thin consistency\r\n\r\n4.  Some brave souls prefer to add pepper at this point, but I say \"to taste\"\r\n\r\n5.  I prefer the texture of Youkon Gold potatoes, but any young new potato with the skins on is great.  If you like earthy, you can use russets.  I have never been a fan of dirt so I stick with thin skins.\r\n\r\nSo play, enjoy!  And don't forget the Romano!",

I baked 4 Italian Sausages in the oven until the were done.  Meanwhile, I cooked the bacon pieces and removed them from the skillet along with most of the grease.  I sauteed the onion and garlic in the remaining Tbs or so of bacon fat.  I also added one carrot, diced.  I added the sauteed vegetables along with the diced potatoes to a 3 and 1/2 quart crock-pot and covered with two cans of chicken broth and one can of beef broth, some of which I used to deglaze the skillet.  When the sausages were done, I sliced them and added them to the pot.  I let the pot simmer on low for about 6 hours.  When we got home, I turned the pot to high and added the chopped kale and cooked bacon and let them cook for about 15 minutes while I made some garlic bread.  When we were ready to serve, I poured a Tbs or so of cream into each bowl and ladled in the soup.  Fantastic and so easy!",

I like to use the \"hot\" italian sausage and fresh spinach instead of kale. I cut my bacon with scissors and fry it by itself. Then I use the bacon grease to saute the onions. There have been occasions when I didn't have any cream on hand and so I used either half and half or whole milk with a little butter. I also have replaced half of the water called for with chicken broth..and it's great. Thanks Nancy.",
