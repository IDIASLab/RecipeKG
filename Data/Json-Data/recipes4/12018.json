I followed the recipe very closely except for the fact that I reduced the amount of onion as 1 cup seemed excessive for this small dish. I served this to seven family members 6 of which like zucchini. Nobody took more than 1 bite and the rest ended up dumped. Luckily it wasn't a very expensive dish to make and I had all of the ingredients on hand. The consistancy was unflattering and the onion (even reduced) was so overpowering my family thought it was an \"Onion Casserole\". Usually I try each recipe more than once if I think it has potential but for my family this is a no-go.",
