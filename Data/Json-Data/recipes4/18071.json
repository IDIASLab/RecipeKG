This was surprisingly good and really is \"superfast.\" I did add some frozen peas and sliced red bell pepper for a little pop of color and I think grated carrot might also add some eye appeal. Next time I ll probably add another mushroom but IMO nothing else needs to be changed in this simple recipe. OK admittedly it is high in sodium and carbs but hey folks you re using convenient and inexpensive ramen noodles! Everything in moderation right? The fresh lime really brightens the flavor and the garlic chile paste and sesame oil reinforces the Asian theme. Thanks Kristin for a tasty new lunch treat.",
