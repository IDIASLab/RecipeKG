There was not any pan drippings so I added a little butter to saut\u00e9 the onions water and then the mushrooms ( which I doubled we are mushroom lovers). I also used the jarred beef gravy but I used two. My family was a little skeptical at first but agreed we will be making it again. And the hubby requested two eggs for next time.",
