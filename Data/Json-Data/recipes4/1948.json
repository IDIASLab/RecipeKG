I shredded a roasted chicken from the grocery store and mixed it with Balsamic & Basil salad dressing, some baby spinach leaves and sun dried tomatoes.

I am vegetarian and didn't eat it but everyone else gobbled it up, including my hubby who tried to sneak as many as possible before my girlfriends came over!  I will keep this one for sure-almost everyone asked for the recipe!",

I actually preferred to place a bit of chicken tomoatoe and cheese on a spinach leaf and roll it. Thanks for a great recipe. This healthy dish (lite Italian dressing reduced fat cheese) will become a staple at our house for a quick and easy weeknight meal.",
