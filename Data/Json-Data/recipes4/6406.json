The Parmesan sauce shines through in every bite of this Stromboli a nice change from the regular tomato sauce. I did also top the deli meat and provolone cheese with some shredded mozzarella cheese since we love cheese. Mine was perfectly golden brown in 25 minutes. I enjoyed it just as it but the son and husband enjoyed dipping theirs in pizza sauce. Very versatile on what deli meats and cheese you use but don't omit the great Parmesan sauce because it takes this Stromboli over the top. Thanks cris for a great recipe. A keeper in this household.",

It doesn't give any clues as to how big the rectangle should be how thick/thin the dough should be or how to roll it up. I have never eaten or made a stromboli so perhaps others take it for granted. Regardless I got help and got it made. I used homemade pizza dough and pizza size pepperoni instead of sandwich size (about 18 slices). I rolled it up jellyroll style sealed the end seams like I do a loaf of bread and it ended up being 15\" by about 4\". The only change I made was to eliminate the eggs due to allergy. I coated the inside with olive oil and sprinkled on the seasoning and parmesan. I also sprayed the top with olive oil and that worked to keep on the toppings. It baked in about 25 min in a convection oven. We liked these so I'm not knocking the recipe rating but I would have passed this by due to lack of instructions if it hadn't been a recipe group pick.",

The parmesan sauce was too thick to spread well or else there wasn't enough of it - I had to make more. Maybe I tried to go too big? Will try again with some adjustments.",
