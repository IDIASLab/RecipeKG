Very much a \"comfort food.\"  You really can't miss with measuring, less water more stew-like, more water soup-like . . . just add or subtract where you like! The kids eat theirs with parmesan cheese over the top. Enjoy!",

I had even used all chicken stock and no water knowing water is flavorless. Too blah for me sorry.",
