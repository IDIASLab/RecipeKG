                "reviewBody": "I doubled the amount of ranch per butter for under the skin and increased the sprinkled butter over top some but not a lot. I did this because another reviewer said that they could not taste the ranch. With my increases the taste of the ranch was faint and I felt it more increased the saltiness which was not really desired. However the overall taste of this turkey breast was wonderful and the breast was juicy. I would not increase the ranch over what this recipe calls for again. I have to admit that half-way through the cooking procedure I was a bit skeptical. It really didn't smell that great. But when the time was right the flavor was there. However I wouldn't quite rate this 4 stars but more like 4.6 or so just enough to tip it to 5. A turkey slow cooked looks pale mushy and unappealing. Add bacon and it looks worse. After it was fully cooked I put this under the broiler to brown up just a bit. I feel this recipe needs that extra step. Don't expect a big ranch flavor with this recipe because you won't find it. But you will find a nice balanced flavor that yields a tender juicy bird.",
