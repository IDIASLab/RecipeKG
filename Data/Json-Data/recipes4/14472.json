We were short on apple cider so we used 1.5 c apple cider.25 c applejack and.25 c orange juice. At 3.5 hours it was mush floating in oily water texture-wise. With what we added it tasted great so I might try it again with 2c water an extra lb of ribs our additions and 3 hours cook time. I d also wait to put the apples in until the halfway point.",
