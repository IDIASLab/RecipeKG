The rum obviously adds flavor but I really prefer my beans to have some sort of sauce if I am serving over rice. So to make this edible I added an extra can of beans most of a can of tomato sauce and some chopped ham. I also added shredded cheddar on top. With the additions I made it would be about a 2 1/2 or 3 star but I have definitely had much better beans and rice recipes.",
