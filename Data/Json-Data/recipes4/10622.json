For anyone who has not tried this I did and it worked great - instead of boiling the noodles I laid them on a sheet pan and poured boiling water over them while I was making the red sauce (btw I like diced tomatoes so I substitued those instead of tom. sauce and water as called for). Since the dish bakes for 45 minutes the noodles came out perfect!! So much easier than boiling the noodles.",

Anyway made this over the weekend for my mom and dad's birthday dinner & I loved that this one uses tomato paste and tomato sauce instead of jarred pasta sauce. I didn't have Italian sausage so I used a combo of lean ground beef and some ground pork. I also added some fresh zucchini and grated carrots and my usual dash of nutmeg to the ricotta mixture. A great tip is to soak uncooked lasagna noodles in hot water for 20-30 mins while you are prepping everything else - no need to boil the water and cook the noodles as they finish cooking when the lasagna goes in the oven! I made this on the Friday left it sitting uncooked until the Saturday and then cooked that afternoon. So yummy. Great with a nice salad and Italian Pinwheel Rolls from this site mmmmm!!",

Added some extra veggies (zucchini mushrooms grated carrots) but it would have been just fine without that. I would rate this higher if I could. I even had some for breakfast this morning and it was even better. I can't believe more people have not tried this recipe. After reading the reviews of other lasagna recipes I found that most people made changes that were already included in this outstanding recipe.",
