It is far removed from the classic french onion soup that we all think of. It was time consuming which I can handle if the rewards and effort pay off. I think that the parsnips were too strong in the stock. I was attracted to this because it sounded so healthy with all the veggies. The color was lacking even though I browned the beef first. I think that some amount of red wine is vital to rceipe or it is just not french onion soup. I will continue on my quest but do thank you for you spuring me on and for a good stock for vegetable soup.",

The stock turned out very rich and flavourful; so the soup was excellent. The key is the stock. I did not add parsnips as I don't have them on hand and they seemed weird for stock. I also used Asiago cheddar and mozzarella cheese which is what I had on hand. Pretty good alternatives too! My family sopped up the soup with Sweet Dinner rolls I made this morning - also from Allrecipes - very good and easy with a bread machine.",

                "reviewBody": "The recipe is time consuming but worth it! I roasted the beef bones and vegetables for 1 hour then placed it in my crock pot with 8 cups of water on low for 8 hours. I had 6 cups of stock after sieving it I adjusted the recipe to 6 servings. I omitted the thyme and wine as I am not a fan. Sauteeing the onions for longer is better I let them cook on low for almost an hour. I deglazed the pan after sauteing the onions and flour with the sherry and 1 cup of water. I added more water after it cooked through as it was too thick I would halve the flour next time. This made 4 large bowls of soup that we enjoyed on a snowy and blustery night. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #InternationalFavourites #FacelessNoMore",
