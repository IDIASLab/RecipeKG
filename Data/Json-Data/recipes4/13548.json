Anna Belle is still sitting at my feet performing all her puppy tricks trying to get another one. I didn't know what corn flour was so I hit up everyone on the Recipe Exchange. Someone said it was probably Masa, someone else said sub rice flour, which I did. My dough was a bit wet, next time I'll throw in a bit more flour. My cookie cutter must be big, I got about 45 treats. This is a really fun recipe, my family is going to be so impressed. I will make more of these for friends who love dogs. Thanks again! ",

If you put these in an air tight container these will last at least 2 weeks. (i used ziploc)",

I didn't have any on hand so I cut the recipe in half and used equal parts cornmeal and flour. Subbed bacon fat for the oil and still used a whole egg because I'm lazy. :)\n\nI saw such mixed reviews on how much water to add for dog biscuits so I used the pie crust method of adding water as you go and watching how the dough forms. I used about half the amount called for, but noticed I had to add a little more each time I re-rolled the scraps. I probably used about 3/4 the amount called for by the time I was done. Used a 2-inch star cutter and go about 45 cookies. My Schipp is going bonkers with excitement.",
