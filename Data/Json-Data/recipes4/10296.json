I used the \"light\" version, it melted quickly, and gave these grits a mellow, cheesy taste.  The garlic flavor is subtle and was just right.  The grits were really runny at 25 minutes, so I baked an additional 15 minutes.  I made this to serve with a dinner entree, so I didn't want grits that needed to be spooned out of the dish...that's OK for breakfast but not what I wanted for a dinner side dish.  The consistency at 40 minutes was perfect:  firm, but still very moist and creamy.",

                "reviewBody": "I, like reviewer Joni, made Garlic Cheese Grits for years using the Kraft Garlic Cheese Roll.  Kraft discontinued making the garlic cheese roll and I went into mourning.  This recipe is very similar, very good.  The only changes I made were using two eggs instead of one, and using 1/4 tsp. garlic powder instead of the chopped garlic.\nHint 1:  To make smooth grits, as opposed to lumpy grits, when the water comes to a boil, slowly add grits while continuously stirring with a whisk.  \ndon;t forget to add the salt.  Whisk until grits come to a boil, then turn temp to low until grits are thickened and cooked, stirring frequently.  I place a lid loosely over the grits, because when the grits start to thicken the mixture can \"pop up\" and burn your arm.   \nHint 2:  It is important to temper the egg(s) before adding to the hot grits, or there will be scrambled egg pieces in the grits.  To temper egg(s), whisk egg(s) in a small bowl thoroughly.  Pour some of the grit mixture, about 1/2 cup, into another small bowl or measuring cup.  While whisking eggs, slowly pour the grit mixture until all is incorporated.  Then, add this mixture to the grits.\nLastly, I do prefer the processed cheese product for this recipe. (I know.)",
