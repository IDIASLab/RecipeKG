If you don't mind the extra calories, a cup of coconut milk adds a delicious richness (don't use regular milk!). If using potatoes, prick them raw, dice into bite size pieces and cook them in the tamarind (or tomato) juice. Okra is GREAT in this recipe.",

The tamarind was too strong and gave the dish a strong tangy flavor that was disagreeable. And the yellow lentils while edible were way too firm---and I even soaked them for a couple of hours first and also cooked them 3X as long as the recipe called for. I could see maybe using an immersion blender on the lentils to puree them after they've been cooked. And in my experience sambar is supposed to have slices of carrot which this recipe did not have. I now have a pot of soup that I am not at all enthusiastic about finishing eating and will probably toss out.",
