I've never had anything similar so I have nothing to compare it to but we were not a fan of the cream cheese topping--it was kind of rubbery when all was said and done. We ended up taking it off the top. The jello itself was good--I didn't have pineapple so left it out and added a bit of water. I didn't have two boxes of orange jello so hubs suggested raspberry and orange. That didn't work so well however so I wouldn't suggest that. Barring that though we liked the jello so would try that again just leaving the topping off. Thanks for the recipe!",
