The best is made by my mother, but the rest of us can make this wonderful facsimile. Easily multiplied, exceedingly flexible - have fun!  The soup is quite good after 2 hours, but the longer it cooks, the more mellow the flavor will be. If you can, leave it for as many as 6 hours (this is a good recipe when you're in the house all day). Serve with croutons or soup nuts, if desired.",

It turned out very thick hardly soupy at all and that was even after I added a couple cups of chicken broth. If you like soupy soup you'll need to add a lot more liquid. I couldn't find a half chicken so I just used separate pieces (a breast a thigh and a couple of legs). Once the chicken was cooked and nice and tender I used tongs to take the meat off the bone. My husband would have freaked out if he'd come across a bone in his soup!",

I added an extra 2 cups of water and cooked the egg noodles separately (other reviewers mentioned it wasn't soupy enough). Great recipe!",
