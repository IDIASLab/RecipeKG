It was not sweet like I thought it would be.  The curry was very interesting and a great ingredient to balance out the with the applesauce.  I enjoyed the amount of sauce because it completely covered the pork chops in the dish as they were baking, although we did throw out a good bit of it after we ate.  The pork chops were slightly overdone at 40 mins, so watch your cook times (and my pork chops were thicker than one inch).  Will definitely make this again.  May use a little more garlic next time also.",

We love curry but I did have to experiment with a variety of curry brands before I came up with one that I have used for about 40 years. We don't care for cumin so I purchase one that doesn't have cumin listed as the first ingredient. As others have said 40 min. at 400 degrees is way too long and high for chops that have already been browned. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and bake for about 30 minutes. Also to keep moist the pan can be covered while cooking. You do have to enjoy curry to like this recipe. We found the curry amount just fine but if you've never had curry I'd reduce it by at least half.",

I also sauteed the meat longer and then cooked it in the sauce on top of the stove on low heat rather than baking it. I find this makes the meat more juicy and tender. I also prefer curry paste over powder. I feel it has a deeper more subtle flavor. If your regular grocer doesn't have it try to find a store that offers Eastern/Asian foods. I LOVE mango chutney and am thinking I'd like to adapt this recipe next time with a mango curry sauce. Yummmm!",

I first browned the chops and placed them in the slow cooker and then browned the apples/onions and placed them on top. Then I combined the sauce ingredients and poured it over all. These were ok. The pork was tender (the slow cooker will do that though) but I didn't really care for the sauce that much. It was fun to make something new (although hot oil almost hit me in the eye in the process!) but this just wasn't to my liking. Hubby really liked it though. So did my 12-month old. He ate just as much of the pork as I did!",
