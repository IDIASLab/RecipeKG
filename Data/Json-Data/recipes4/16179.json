Just reading through the ingredients, it sounded delicious even if there was only one review listed.  And I was not disappointed.  Even if I did not use lamb and used chicken instead, it tasted just lovely with that buttery goodness in the rice.  I followed the recipe almost exact, but because it was a meal for just me and my husband, I cut the ingredients in half.  My husband loved it.  I will definitely add this to the rotation and will try it with lamb for sure.  Make sure to not forget the yogurt, because in the end... this goes well with the whole dish.  Enjoy!",
