I am a health nut but use the best yummy stuff for Christmas, I am just careful for myself! My oldest son came over for supper, he dug in, and he LOVED it, and he says very little about anything I make.  I searched for it for this year as well. I am making it for my works Christmas parties pot luck supper. NO WORRIES, IT WAS/IS PERFECT FOR GROUPS! I am making this as one, of a few of our favorite snacky hors d' oeuvre for family on Christmas Eve too. It is PERFECT,and WONDERFUL, and for all the raves, it is very EASY! \n\nYes, I made it as is with butter ranch and all, I used aged shredded cheddar cheese and packed it into all the fingers with yummy cooked bacon. I followed all the ingredients, and cooking instructions perfectly, it turned out fabulously! MY BACON TIP, I cut the bacon into small peices while raw, (I have dedicated kitchen scissors), then cook the 1 to 2 inch squares. I don't have to handle hot bacon or deal with cutting it after, my time saver!",

I did not have a loaf of sourdough bread but did have a loaf of sweet Italian bread so I used it. For the dressing I had Dry Buttermilk Ranch Mix by SD from AR on hand so I used that and the flavor was wonderful. Three slices of bacon was the perfect amount and I just eye-balled the cheese. This bread will be a hit during football season. The ranch dressing was delicious with this and I might try it with Italian seasoning. Good choice last week for Recipe Group. Thanks Angela for sharing your recipe. It s a keeper!",

I cut the bread a bit deeper than it called for, as I am well-aware of the toughness of the crust on any artisan bread. I also let the bacon drain until it was completely dry of any visible fat. Made a huge difference when I assembled the loaves. I made enough for my whole family (9 siblings, their spouses and kids and grandkids; my 9 kids, their spouses, 36 grandkids and 12 great-grandkids). That's about 90 of us for Thanksgiving brunch - a total of 15 loaves, and they all came out great. I also had the help of two 12-yr-olds (a grandson and a great-granddaughter).",
