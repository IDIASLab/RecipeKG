Instead of boiling the squash and onions as the directions stated, I put them in a glass bowl and covered loosely with a cover and put it in the microwave for 4 minutes. It was a perfect. Drained well and added to my crockpot. I did also season with salt, pepper and a sprinkle of dried thyme then added the cheese cubes and butter. Cooked on high for 30 minutes, and low for 45.

Make sure to drain them very well so the cheese sauce is not watery. We added salt and pepper to our individual servings because my husband has to watch his salt intake but I think it would benefit from some seasoning while cooking. I think this would also work to cook up the squash and onions drain well and freeze in portions to complete later. Thanks floridabeaches123.",

I cooked it in the slow cooker then I dumped the entire thing in 2 separate batches in a blender. Went from whip to liquify and made a good cheesy soup from it. The older people that were going to be eating it probably would have had a bad time with the seeds in the squash. They ALL loved it certainly a keeper for a nice soup before the main course beef roast. Makes the roast rest a while while they eat their soup. THANKS!!",
