Since it's just my husband and I, I cut the recipe in half and made it in my smaller cast iron pan. I couldn't bring myself to add the salt because the self-rising cornmeal already has salt in it. What I really liked about this recipe is that the shortening that you melt in the skillet before adding the batter creates the crunchy crust on the bottom of the bread. Neither Pam nor oil does that. So good!",
