Once you grill them, they are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Inside, we used thinly sliced deli ham and left over pork tenderloin from the night before, swiss cheese, mayo, mustard and fresh pickles such as claussen's.  We grilled them up on the Foreman grill, pressing hard to flatten them out and heat everything through.  I have yet to make these without rave reviews!! I now have a new favorite sandwich!  Very easy to make and fantastic!!  Thanks.",

I always smash a garlic and rub it on the cut side of the bread before spreading the mayo and mustard, and then follow the rest of the recipe as indicated -now that is a WOW of a Cuban sandwich! The reason for the added garlic flavor is that \"traditional Cuban roasted pork\" is loaded with garlic and that is the special flavor to this sandwich that you will not find in regular store bought sliced roasted pork. Try this trick to see the difference - Otherwise, this is a winner of a sandwich!   ",
