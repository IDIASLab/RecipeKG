If you can get it use New Mexico or California Chili powder - CA chili is milder than New Mexico Chili powder (both are sold in small cello bags in the Mexican section of the market for less than a $1.00)  Also, I would suggest using chicken broth instead of water.  I made this as a directed using CA chili powder & water - the taste was lacking so I added a cube of chicken bouillon - that really bumped up the flavor.   This sauce makes a  great wet burrito or for a sauce for Chili Rellenos.",

I have found if you use a can of Flavorite Enchilada sauce and another can of chicken stock it makes up for the flavor but this recipe tastes just like Mexican Village gravy. So when you have a hankering for some homeschool taste of home this is it!",
