I cut out some of the spices that I didn't have (like ginger), but for the most part I followed the recipe to a tee. The only note I'd like to make is I wasn't quite sure when to add the apricots because they were mentioned in the ingredients but not the directions. Maybe I just lack cooking intuition, but I ended up just making my apricots my \"during cooking\" snack instead of an ingredient in my samosas. All in all I loved them and will definitely be making them for a party!",
