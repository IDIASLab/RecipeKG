You could always make it half hot and half not depending on who is eating with you with the heat they like or not. When I placed the meat on the tortilla I added a little cheddar cheese then rolled them up (it rolled 6). After placing them in my dish then I topped it off with Hatch Valley 505 Green Chile Sauce I sprinkled cheese on top and in the over at 350 for 10 - 15 min. After over I then dished one on a plate topped with lettuce cheese tomato sour cream and avocado! Deeelicious!! Excellent!!",
