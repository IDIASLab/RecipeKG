I sampled the butter mixture as I was applying to the corn, it was so good I made more to put on sliced potatoes and onions - wrapped them in foil and grilled alongside the corn! (hint - to make the mixture easier to spread on the corn, pop unmelted butter in the microwave for 20 seconds, then mix the other ingredients in. It makes a thicker paste and is easier to spread)",

I sliced some red potatoes and micro'd them for 3 minutes, tossed with the yummy sauce, placed in foil, on med heat on the bbq, turned to not burn, about 10 min. I micro'd them because I remembered about the leftover sauce right when I started some bugers, so if you plan ahead, you can prob just bbq them longer without the pre-prep. OMG! They were soooo delish! You could prob use this sauce on chunks of scrap wood and it would be wonderful!  Thanks for a great recipe!",

We drain canned corn & put on aluminum foil. Pour some of this all over, wrap up in double layer of the foil & grill it when we don't have corn on the cob handy and it's EXCELLENT. The other thing we love it on is diced, boiled yukon gold potatoes. Put them in a foil packet w/ this & grill - I swear, I completely forget about the steaks that are right beside them on the plate.",

I soaked my corn in cold water mixed with a little sugar and salt and left the corn in the husks. I softened the butter and used a little olive oil since I didn't have macadamia nut oil on hand and then added the rest of the ingredients making a spread. I grilled the corn as I usually do in it's husks and when it came off the grill I spread the butter mixture over top. It's definitely a savory herb mixture to compliment roasted corn - YUM!",
