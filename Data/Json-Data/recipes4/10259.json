I used the sponge version that took a little over an hour.  I did use 110degree water and did add just a pinch of sugar.  I let it 'grow' in its sponge form for about 2 hours.  This dough was a beautiful consistency when it came together; incredibly easy to work with.  I let it rise in a warmed oven so it didn't take 2 hours to double in bulk, only 1 hour.  The crust was crispy on the edges with a chewy consistency.  It made 2 large pizzas.  The taste was great; it had a slight sourdough tang I think because I let the sponge ferment longer.  The edges don't get browned but didn't matter==superb crust consistency.",

I did bake it on my baking stone @ 450F, and got excellent results: the interior crumb was tender, and, due to the absence of oil, had excellent gluten strands[better than I have ever found in pizza!] with also those awesome tiny air bubbles all over the outside of the crust.  A must for any artisan baker!!!  SUPER!!!  Note: it did require more flour than it called for whenever I kneaded it... about half cup more, perhaps.",

It was all going well until I covered the dough that I'd half shaped with waxed paper to rest.  (Don't do that) The waxed paper stuck, taking half the dough with it, and all attempts to reshape it failed.  Good thing it makes two pizzas, right?  Wrong.  I shaped the second one, then got cocky and tried to move it to the pizza stone without letting it rest.  Yeah, don't do that either.  Big holes once again.  I managed to get one pizza shaped and on the pizza stone somehow, in spite of my obvious incompetence.  Long story less long, this makes a great, chewy crust that is as close to pizzeria pizza crust as I've been able to create at home - definitely doesn't have that 'homemade' pizza taste to it.  I hope to make it again once I've gotten over this experience.  Thanks for the recipe!",
