I also used spicy sausage rather than mild(the cream soup will tone it down).  Also added fresh sliced mushrooms to the middle before rolling it up, and had some leftover, so added the rest on top at the same time I topped it with the remaining soup.\r\n\r\nI recommend spraying a piece of aluminum foil with non-stick spray and spreading the meat on it.  Then you can use the foil to help roll it up.  It also makes for easy clean up.",

It is a little messy before getting it in the pan but definitely worth it. I patted it out and rolled it on plastic wrap and after placing the meatloaf in the pan just gathered up the mess and threw it away! Even my husband who isn't fond of meatloaf liked it. In fact he took the leftovers to work with him for lunch. I'm going to use this recipe again!",
