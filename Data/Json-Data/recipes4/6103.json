I couldn't find one I liked, so I mixed and matched and came up with this one! It was so good that I didn't have any leftovers. Happily fed 8 adults and 3 children. Use different spices for your taste! I added some onion powder and Italian seasonings. After you serve, leave the lid off of the slow cooker so the french-fried onions remaining crispy on top. You could also use cream of mushroom soup in place of the cream of chicken.",

Used Jackie's alterations with one can each cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup, along with 4 cans of green beans (drained) - just the right amount of sauce w/o being too soupy. I also added about 1 t soy sauce and a dash of garlic to the recipe.  Freshly grated parmesan added a nice flavor.  Cooked on LOW about 5 hours.  This dish was a real hit and so easy.  I will definitely be making this one again and again.  Thanks Hollus2!",

I reduced the milk to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 t onion and 1/2 t garlic powder, 1 t Italian seasoning (as was recommended by others, and omitted the salt.  I also added an additional 1/2 cup parmesan cheese at the very end.  To be honest, I will probably not add the fried onions next time and add additional saut\u00e9ed onions.  We only had 5 people for dinner and there was very little left over.  Great recipe and very easy!!!",

Went with whole milk - only 1/2 cup and used freshly grated parm. Also added one minced garlic clove. 4 hours on low was plenty of time to heat everything through.

It was good, but if I make it again in the crock pot, I'm cutting back on the soup and/or milk, (and will probably switch back to the traditional mushroom soup rather than the cream of chicken) as it was far more liquid-y than the regular oven baked version.  I did add Worcestershire sauce and extra parmesan.  Overall, it was good, but unless I'm short on oven space, I'll probably go back to the traditional oven recipe.",
