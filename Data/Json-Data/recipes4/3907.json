I changed the recipe slightly to fit my preference for well browned and crispy chicken.  Therefore, I suggest searing the chicken breasts in a hot pan until the desired color is attained.  Then, turn down the heat to medium and add the pan ingredients.  Cook until some of the juice has been reduced.  I also would cover the dish in the oven to avoid drying out as there is not much liquid in the recipe.  The olives give a beautiful green color but I might also suggest adding some strips of sweet red bell pepper to enhance the appearance.  When squeezing lemons, I never just throw the rinds away.  They can be sliced or cut in rings to add a beautiful side garnish to the serving plate.",
