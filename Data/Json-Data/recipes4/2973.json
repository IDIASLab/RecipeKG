After you brown the meat and saute the onion, veggies, and garlic, I recommend doing a wine reduction with a basic merlot (one that you can actually drink).  Reduce the wine on med-high heat until it you have half of what you started with (I usually start with 1 - 1/2 cups).  Then add 1 large can of tomato sauce.  A generous sprinkle of basil, parsley, and italian seasoning.  Then add your meat and veggies back to the sauce.  Let simmer about 5 minutes.  Then top to over your cheese in your casserole dish and bake.  I would like to add that this casserole would be really good with eggplant, zuccini, carrots, squash, etc.  You really could add any combination of vegetable(s) and it would be delicious.  Next time I will definately keep the celery but I am going to add shredded zuccini and eggplant.  I will cut out the diced tomatoes and double the tomato sauce; only because my kids didn't care for the tomatoes chunks.",

For cheese I couldn't find Mexican blend so used a Colby/Monterey Jack blend which worked great. I stuck with the sharp cheddar on top. My 13 year old who never eats tomato sauce cleaned his plate!",

For the cost of buying pasta and meat that will last so much longer than that box this recipe is worth stocking the ingredients. I cooked as written except did not add the extra cheese on top. No biggie it was cheesy without it. What I loved the most is the fact that the entire pan is gone! Gone gone gone! We ate it all. It has such a great body it holds up well for leftovers in the frig. I just added a salad and breadsticks for a great meal. Oh yeah I always kick the seasonings up with herb mixes regardless of recipe lists for this type of dish. Do You!",
