The cake was moist and remained that way until the last piece was eaten! (Which didn't last long.) The frosting was another story. This was not as great as expected and fortunately for me I did not add it to the cake. I think maybe it needed some heavy cream... Again I highly recommend this recipe for the cake part.",

I also used my own version of carob frosting (carob powder milk and powdered sugar). I also found that I had to cook it for 20 minutes longer than the recipe stated. I grew up eating carob cake every year for my birthday and this is one of the best ones I have tasted. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!",

This is a definite keeper - the cake is moist without being half raw and the banana adds a nice flavour and the icing is tasty too. Next time I'll only make half the icing though. I substituted 1/3 of the flour with whole wheat and sprinkled shredded coconut over the icing.",

The 2 diabetics in the house were excited about having this for future b-day cakes. No wonder other members were so happy over this recipe! We are grateful to have this recipe now too!",
