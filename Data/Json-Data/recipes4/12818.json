I thought it was anything but. Subtle maybe but REALLY tasty. Eat it as a side dish to make sure you get enough \"flavor\" out of your dinner!

I used 1 c. brown rice and 2 c. water and baked the rice for an hour without the whole cloth thing. Baked brown rice always comes out much better than stove top. All the spices I used were ground. And I used oil instead of shortening. At first it seemed bland but after a few spoonfuls I really grew a liking to it. The flavors are subtle and it works great as a side dish.",

I could not find cardamon seeds at my grocery store so I used ground cardamon. Also added 1 teaspoon of chicken bullion along with the water and yogurt in lieu of the salt. Used olive oil instead of vegetable shortening to cook onions and spices. Did not use saffron threads because I do not like this spice. Saffron is too over powering for my taste. Used Indian Basmati rice in place of regular long-grain white rice. I cooked the rice in my enameled covered cast iron dutch oven with three terry cloth towels tucked under the lid to absorb moisture; this worked well.",
