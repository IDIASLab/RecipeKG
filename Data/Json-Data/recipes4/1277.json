I baked some fresh salmon and shredded it instead of using the canned salmon. Mixed in 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs, eggs and 2 sliced green onions instead of regular onion. Added 1 tbsp each of dijon and lemon juice and a few dashes of hot pepper sauce and salted to taste. Also added about 1/2 cup of shredded hash browns. No celery seed or dill. Formed patties with wet hands and dipped in more panko before frying in olive oil. Served with a lemon caper sauce from another cooking website (1 cup mayo, 1/4 cup each chopped chives and Italian parsley, 2 tbsp each minced shallot and lemon juice, 1 tbsp olive oil, 1/2 tsp hot pepper sauce and 2 tbsp minced capers). It definitely needs a sauce with it. Next time I will try a dill sauce. They were not dry at all-I had to turn them gingerly in the pan because they were so moist. An interesting way to cook salmon. I uploaded my photo of the recipe. Yummy!Thank you!",

Because we try to avoid fried foods, I used a 1/4 cup and scooped them into muffin tins that had been shot with a quick spray of oil.  I baked them at 350\u00ba for about 40 mins.  I served them with lemon sauce from this site.  Fantastic recipe, Joy!",

I used fresh dill, ritz cracker crumbs, a little old bay seasoning, green onions (only 3 chopped up finely) and I didn't have any potato flakes, so I threw in a couple of handfulls of frozen hash browns, and made large patties (hamburger sized).  I fried them in canola oil in my electric skillet until they were good & brown & crispy.  They were just delicious!  These are great on a hamburger bun with mayo, tomato & lettuce, and I even ate a few of the leftovers for lunch today just with some cucumber ranch dressing and no hamburger bun!  Just as good leftover, but not as crispy after warming in the microwave, but just as tastey!\r\nThanks for a great recipe!",
