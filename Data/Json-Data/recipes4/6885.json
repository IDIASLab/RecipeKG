We grilled the steak and sliced it into very thin strips. I saut\u00e9ed the onions and peppers until half way cooked then added a cup of sliced mushrooms and continued to saut\u00e9 the veggies. After cooking the quesadillas as suggested I sieved them with sides of sour cream avocado and salsa verde as options. I used the large flour tortillas which were too large and not as easy to flip over. I will remember to used the smaller 8 inch tortillas. This made two large quesadilla. Will make this again.",
