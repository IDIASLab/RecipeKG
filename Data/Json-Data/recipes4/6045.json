I doubled the recipe, but did not double the amount of chicken (i don't like a lot of meat in casseroles personally),  did not double the cheese or croutons either to save on calories. I used cream of mushroom soup because the fat free version is sold in the big cans, which are much cheaper than the small cans, but they did not sell the fat free cream of chicken soup in the big cans. I used a combination of low fat sharp cheddar, low fat smoked gouda and 2% milk Velveeta cheeses instead of cheddar cheese to save on calories. I think you could use pretty much any cheese you have on hand or skip the cheese altogether and it would still be great. I mixed a half cup of the cheese mixture into the casserole and sprinkled a half cup on top with about a quarter cup of seasoned croutons i smashed with a rolling pin in a Ziploc bag. I also replaced a little less than half a cup of chicken broth with white wine which added a wonderful flavour, and i halved the seasoned salt and added maybe half a teaspoon to a teaspoon of old bay seasoning. I also used  brown rice  because it's healthier and caramelized a couple cloves of garlic with the onion and mushrooms.  It turned out amazingly!  I'll definitely be  making this again!",

I increased the amount of rice, chicken, cream of chicken soup and sour cream due to the amount of people in my family. Thought the dish might wind up being too liquidy or rich, but it wasn't. The liquids do cook out to help solidify the casserole. It also did not taste overly rich. The cheese and crushed croutons on top are a very nice touch. Would highly recommend this to anyone who likes chicken and rice. If you have a picky eater who you don't think will like the other ingredients, don't worry. The veggies and creams blend in with the taste very well.",

I made homemade cream of celery soup, and by doing this I didn't need to add the milk or the 1/2 of chicken broth because the cream of celery had enough liquid. So I did Greek yogurt in place of sour cream and the homemade cream of celery mixed with the rice and chicken and I also added a bag of frozen broccoli and then I added all the seasonings that I prefer. I also added more cheese than instructed and baked at 375 instead of 350, as it got done better this way. Great recipe!",
