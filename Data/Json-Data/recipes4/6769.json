Thaw the dough per the instructions on the package, cut into 2x2\" squares and line mini muffin tins with them before filling with pear, honey, and brie mixture.  I couldn't find any fresh thyme at the store, so I used dried and it worked OK.  Instead of drizzling honey over the pears and brie, I put the diced pears in a bowl, drizzled honey over  them and mixed it up with the dried thyme before spooning into the puff pastry squares in the muffin tin.  Since the recipe called for fresh thyme, I eyeballed the amount and think I used a little too much as the herb flavor can overpower the subtly of brie and pear.  So, just a warning  to use it sparingly.    Another recipe I found called for cardamom, which I may have tried but didn't have any on hand.  Just a variation someone else might want to try.  Overall, a good recipe that is easy to make and has good flavor.",

The cheese was completely melted by then, and they were piping hot.  I'll be making these again!",
