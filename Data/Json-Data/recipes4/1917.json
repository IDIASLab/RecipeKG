Unless they're very small, two heads are too much.  3.  Add another tomato.  My wife suggested using less barbeque sauce in the dressing, so you might try adding the bbq sauce to the dressing to taste.",

I rubbed my chicken breasts with a little \"Taco Seasoning II\" from this site and grilled them brushing them with a bit of KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce right before they were done. I used a mix of romaine and iceberg lettuce and added some shredded Mexican blend cheese. Instead of bottled ranch dressing I used \"Ranch-Style Buttermilk\" Dressing from this site and didn't mix and barbeque sauce in it. Overall very tasty!",
