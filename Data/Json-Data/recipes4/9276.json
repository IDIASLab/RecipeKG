The proportions of this recipe created little hard dry balls with almost no meat. I cooked about a dozen as a test run, knowing something looked wrong, and they were OK hot, but as soon as they cooled, they were stones.  So, to the remainder of my mix,  I added a 3rd pound of sausage and they turned out great.  If you look at other sausage ball recipes, you'll see the usual ratio of bisquick to sausage is 2:1, not 3:1.",

I cooked the sausage first and then mixed the ingredients but the \"dough\" wasn't sticking together. So I added 4 eggs to the mix and that made it stick. They expanded and in the end not in a ball shape more like a biscuit. My husband thought they turned out similar to the biscuit at Red Lobster.",

I reduced it to about 3 1/2 for the 2 lbs of sausage and 2 lbs of cheese and added a bit of chicken broth just to make it easier to mix everything together.  I also think raising the temp to 325 would be better.  Several of the helpful hints that I read in different reviews include:  line a cookie sheet with foil and use a baking rack so the grease drips onto the foil during cooking (that's gotta reduce the calorie count a little, right?), and use disposable latex gloves to mix ingredients together, and finally, use block cheese and grate it yourself.  After those adjustments, the sausage balls turned out to be excellent.",

The ingredients should be mixed well until they become a paste-like dough. If your ingredients aren't sticking it means the sausage has not been thoroughly incorporated. Use your hands and mix and knead until you get that paste. Pull off smaller portions to make smaller balls. Golf ball size makes more of a biscuit than a ball. Recipe perfect as is if you do the required mixing.",
