If you like it spicier you can add more ground cayenne pepper or Jalapenos or any other favorite spicy pepper. If made correctly, the pickle will bubble in your mouth! You can leave the cucumbers whole or quartered. You can substitute sea salt for the pickling salt.",

The pickles are very crunchy and the level of heat from the cayenne is really tasty just about perfect for me. Now the bad part. This liquid in the jar tastes like I just took a tablespoon of salt and put it directly in my mouth. At first I thought where s the vinegar but then I was told there are brined pickles that require no vinegar. Well all I can say is that 2 Tbsp of pickling salt (or sea salt as recommended by the recipe author) for 1-1/2 cups of water will do nothing but give you a jar of pickles that are too salty. So here s what I m going to do in order to salvage what I have. I m going to drain out most of the brine in the jar and add some vinegar. If that doesn t work then they will will go down the disposal. Sorry for the harsh review (and I rarely do a 1-star review) but IMO this recipe has MAJOR issues that need to be resolved.",
