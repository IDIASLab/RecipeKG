I used a little more red wine than called for to get a little different flavor. I also made it a meat sauce instead of making meatballs. I added ground beef AND ground pork to the recipe instead of the brisket. Unbelievable! The flavor of the sauce really stuck to the pasta (I used rigatoni) and the aroma throughout the house was great. People could smell it from outside. Obviously I can't say enough. One of the best I've ever had!",

I didn't have brisket and I used lean ground beef in its place. Omitted the bay leaf because we don't like personal preference and added oregano. Used Italian Sausage I had on hand and took it out of casing. I did go out and get pork neck bones and I'm glad I did because I really think this is what adds to the flavor if using ground beef. This was really good and when I go shopping this weekend I'll pick up the original to recipe and try. Then I'll scale it up to freeze. Great flavor thanks so much for the post.",
