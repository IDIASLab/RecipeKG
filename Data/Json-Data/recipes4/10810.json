It's easy to coat the sides with this method. You get crumbs in the icing but most of these slide off as you ladle.",

If the fondant starts to get too cool it will thicken. Have a water bath on the stove or crock pot to warm the cooling fondant. Any of the spills drips can be reheated this way too. Just scrape it back into a heat safe bowl and place over the water bath until you have the consistency you want. For more flavor and color add a little \"kool-aid\" powder before adding powdered sugar to heated liquid.",

I read some of the reviews that said they had a hard time coloring it and since we needed it BLACK I subbed out a full ounce of the water for black food coloring. It was probably a touch of overkill but it was black as night. I made it twice and learned that the fondant doesn't change consistency very much when it gets to the appropriate temperature. It just takes less drying time the longer and hotter it is cooked. The first batch I heated until it boiled and had to cool to an appropriate temperature and it hardened almost on contact. The second batch I cooked about 15 degrees higher than the recipe stated and it stayed tacky longer. It was much easier to smooth and a lot less stressful.",
