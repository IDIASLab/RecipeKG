I debated on which way to cook them but I wanted some extra crunch and decided to fry them. I first dusted the cutlets in flour then in beaten egg finished them off with Panko bread crumbs and then fried them in a little bit of oil on the stove. I am happy with my choice because these turned out great! I bought the mini naan's which ended up being a little small. There was no extra naan to fold up around the pork to eat like a taco so mine were more like a tostada. This is a good recipe and one that could be easily adapted to what you have on hand.",
