My oldest son and husband loved it. My youngest wouldn't touch it after a bite and I thought it had a nice flavor. The only thing I'd change is swap out 1 lb of the ground venison burger for ground venison sausage (something I do for all my meatloaves normally to add more flavor) and cut down on a little bit of the stuffing (the seasoning in it was a bit much with the barbecue.) The barbecue was much more predominant than what I usually taste in my regular meatloaf with ketchup. Very nice change!",

Used a small to medium white onion and a stick of celery chopped. Stuffing used was Stove Top Savory Herb. Replaced water with 3/4c of milk. For topping rather than more BBQ sauce I used my blend of Heinz ketchup brown sugar French's spicy brown mustard and Ghost Sauce (http://soninlaw.net) It's good. I'll make it like this again.
