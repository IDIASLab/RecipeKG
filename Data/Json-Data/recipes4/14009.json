This recipe is very versatile and can be seasoned so many different ways.  Please feel free to try your own favorite seasoning combinations.  My two boys who are now 27 and 31 and my husband  request this simple dinner frequently and I have taught the boys to make it but they say mine tastes different.  I love to cook and they love to eat.  This is such a simple recipe and I usually double so they have plenty to take home with them.  It heats up well.",

I only had 1/2 a red bell pepper so I added chopped carrots and some frozen kernel corn to make up for it. I added spices like cayenne pepper oregano & paprika for additional flavor. I also substituted beef broth for the bouillon granules & water. I used 1/2 cup of the beef broth to simmer with the browned beef & veggies while I cooked the rice separately in 1 1/2 cups of the beef broth then added the rice to the skillet at the end so that I didn't end up with overcooked rice. It worked out well! We like to sprinkle some tobasco on top for an extra kick!",

I make it in triple batches and freeze it for brown bag lunches quick snacks or on the go dinners. I add lots of things: Diced jalapenos spinach peas corn scrambled eggs cilantro... whatever I have need to use up and which I intuitively determine will taste good. The point is I gotta feed the boys and I gotta do it on a budget and I gotta do it so they're well-nourished and many times have to take care of it themselves. This fits the bill in all those categories. If you're going to build up the volume of the meal be sure you adjust the seasonings which is why I made note about the jalapenos and cilantro. I usually add more onions and some garlic and only a little bouillon only because of the salt content. Very tasty very easy and freezes well.",
