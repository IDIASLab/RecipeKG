The ingredients I remember using are much the same as those listed by J.D. It did use tomato sauce rather than paste. I do not recall using Worcestershire sauce I think I did use garlic powder. But the most significant difference is the addition of fresh bell pepper and fresh green onion chopped that is added to the cheese mixture. Because they are added raw they don't become over-cooked while baking. They give a lovely bright green contrast to the white cheese and red sauce plus add a lot of flavor and crunch.Oh and there was no butter in the recipe I used. My main project now is getting all the amounts correct!",

The blandness was prevelant even after adding extra worchestire sauce and adding more hot sauce I used margarine instead of butter and I used light cream cheese light sour cream and lowfat cottage cheese. Possibly ricotta would be better and tomato paste with roasted garlic. I think I will try again and work it up a bit",
