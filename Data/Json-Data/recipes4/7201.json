The top was brown and they looked done at 30 minutes but the potatoes were not cooked through. I returned them to the oven tented with foil to prevent further browning for another 30 minutes. 3 cups of Alfredo sauce was too much for the amount of potatoes. The bottom of the dish was swimming in sauce. The flavor was really good and with a few changes these would be great.",
