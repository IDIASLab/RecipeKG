Once browned, I added the water and the curry powder. I added chilli powder in lieu of the red pepper flakes (I realised I didn't have any), brought all to a boil, stirring frequently (I noticed when left alone to boil, it was getting clumpy). Brought it all back down to simmer after 10 min (as directed), slowly added the yogurt in . I also realised I didn't have any half & half left, so I had to think fast. I used sour cream, and it was great. Let all that come together, and then added some chopped red & green peppers, and some steamed cauliflower. Let it cook for about 10 more min. then served over Jasmine rice. Was great! Will definitely make this again. *posted a photo as well*",

This may taste a little bland without a small amount of salt but that might just be me. My sauce also came out runny but if you boil with the sauce pan lid a little bit skewed it helps thicken up the sauce during the first half of this recipe. Overall this a good easy recipe curry that could use a little bit more flavor and less heat. My recommendation is to cut down or out the Red Pepper Flake and use some salt.",
