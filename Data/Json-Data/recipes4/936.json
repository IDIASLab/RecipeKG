Kick it up with some red pepper flakes.  Must use fresh garlic and salmon.  Don't pre-cook your salmon, there is no need.  Add chunks in raw and then let it simmer, they cook very quickly and will also be much more tender in the finished soup.  Also use fat free evaporated milk and thicken with corn starch. A splash of fresh green peas and Enjoy!!!",

I've also used 1/2 smoked, 1/2 fresh salmon and the smokiness gave it a wonderful flavor, similiar to a good clam chowder.  However, the one big thing I would change about this recipe is to reduce the amount of cheddar to 1 or 1.5 cups, otherwise the original recipe ends up tasting too much like cheddar soup. 1 cup cheese is enough to salt and thicken it nicely.  Also, if making for company, I would eliminate the carrots - adds to much chunkiness to a dish that should be creamy and smooth.  Also, if just using fresh salmon, add a few teaspoons of liquid smoke for a nicer aroma-- makes all the difference.  This soup has been part of our regular rotation and is very healthy and kid friendly. My 4 and 1 yr. gobbles it up.",

My husband now rates my version of this soup (\"smoky salmon chowder\") as his favorite soup we've tried thus far!\n\nThe following changes make a \"smoky\" version of the original and requires liquid smoke. If you don't like that smoky flavor, you might not want to follow my advice. However, if you do like smoky flavor this is to die for!\n\nUse:\n1 LB Fresh Salmon smoked on the barbecue; use 3-4 cloves of fresh garlic; omit the carrots; double the dill weed; use only 1 cup of real cheddar cheese; and finally, as the soup is finishing add TWO capfuls of Wright's Liquid Smoke into the soup.
