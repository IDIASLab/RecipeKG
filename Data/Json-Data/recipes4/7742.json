They were nice because they did not have a lot of seeds.  I did not seed the tomatoes and they were just fine. This is ridiculously good.  Way beyond the effort it takes to make it.

This was a treat at my in laws every Sunday and I still make it weekly. The leftovers are happily tossed with penne pasta or put inside a risotto the next day and I think my family loves it more for the leftovers! Serve this with crusty Italian bread to sop up the juice!
