These eggs will not stain clothes or hands and they are perfect for an egg hunt because the dew from the grass will not change the colors and because they blend so well with rocks and leaves, they are a bit of a challenge for the older kids.  The yellow and red onions produce a stronger color than the white skins and some will be so beautiful that they are the only centerpiece you will need and you will wish you can keep it forever.",

I didn't have any cloth, so I made mine by wrapping the eggs in the skins and then wrapping them in aluminum foil.  I wasn't sure they would turn out, but they did!  So much easier and less time consuming.  The eggs are beautiful and I am happy to find a new spin on an old tradition.  I did add a teaspoon of vinegar to the pot; not sure whether that did anything or not.  Also, once the eggs are cool and dry, you can make them shine by rubbing a tiny bit of vegetable oil on the outside.",

Use your favorite method to blow out the raw egg from the shell - I just tap a small hole with the sharp end of a knife in each end of a raw egg and then blow with your mouth or and egg blowing tool on one hole while the raw egg pushes through the other hole. If you have trouble use a toothpick to try and lance the egg yolk while it is in the shell before blowing. Once all the raw egg is out of the shell rinse off the empty shell and begin to wrap (carefully) dry onion skins around the shell. Secure with aluminum foil or cheese cloth and boil until desired color is achieved. Drain the eggs and let cool before unwrapping. Boiling water will get inside the egg shell so be careful and unwrap over a bowl or sink. The marble affect will be permanent and you can use the eggs to decorate year after year. You can leave with matte finish or cover with favorite clear coat finish.",
