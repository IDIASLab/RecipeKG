Use canola oil (1/2 cup) or margarine or both to make up for the oil from the nuts. Use two eggs. Add a two teaspoons soy sauce to give it a deeper color and ease up on the salt. Refrigerate. This was taste-tested and found to be a dead ringer for chopped liver. I was contemplating using shelled sunflower seeds but someone wanted to eat them - should be worth a try. So my compliments on the original. This nut-free version is also cheaper.",

After a night in the fridge the consistency and flavor are totally different and absolutely wonderful! The texture is the only serious giveaway as it's not quite as homogeneous and creamy as pate. I processed for a long time but some lentil husks just didn't get throughly ground so there's a little bit of a veggie/grainy texture from the fiber. If you can live with that you will love this recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe directed although I added a fair amount of kosher salt (2-3 tsp) and no pepper.",
