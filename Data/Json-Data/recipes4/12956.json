The pork is so moist and tender that it will fall apart when you go to cut it.  I find it comes out best with the loin that has two sections.  If it is a single loin, it still comes out great, but does not fall apart quite so much. Everyone who tries this loves it so far. It's my husband's favorite and very easy to make. It cooks for 1 hr 45 min - 2 hrs.",

I must agree with another reviewer to make sure you use true maple syrup-no Mrs. Butterworth's here:). I agree with the submitter to dredge in flour and sear in hot oil to keep in those juices as an important step, not to be omitted. This is great in the oven--don't know that doing this in the crock pot would have the same effect. A lot of reviewers modify the recipe from the original submitter and then rate it upon their modifications rather than using the original and review on that and then try it again with their suggestions and rate it and note that in their review so people can gauge what they have done and give a more accurate review on the original submission. This recipe was excellent, I will use it again for company and for family. I couldn't stop eating it. It was that good by the originator. The only comment I would make is that I may make a little less sauce due to the expense of the maple syrup and I feel halfing the original ingredients would provide a sufficient amount. ",

Here are my changes: I used 2 pork tenderloins (4 small), doubled the ingredients, used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce instead of ketchup,6 cloves of garlic and didn't brown it first. I put it in a pan and covered it and baked it for 2 hours and the last 1/2 hr I took off the cover. It was melt in your mouth tender. It was wonderful with apple-stuffed acorn squashes and a salad.

I do mine in the crock pot and vary the time depending on how much/what form of pork I use. The key to making this really work is the sauce. I use a bit more garlic and when the pork is done I strain the sauce and cook on the stove top until thickened. I will try BBQ sauce in place of ketchup next time to see which is better!
