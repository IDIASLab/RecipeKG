The crust overpowered everything else IMO. I did find the chocolate wafer cookies....they are expensive 5/9 oz. box and you need a whole box. It was difficult to tell when it was done. The center layer was very firm almost too firm. Whipped topping complemented the center layer but not the cookie layer. Not my cup of tea but my husband loved it. I'll stick to a Graham cracker crust 6 oz. Jello box double the water 8 oz. Cream cheese and 3-4 cups whipped topping. I may even skip the top whipped topping layer.",

                "reviewBody": "I would more accurately give this recipe a 4 1/2 stars but thats not an option so I rounded up. I would remove a half star do to either my mistake or recipe flaw. Overall the taste was great it looked awesome and it wasnt heavy. Mistakes or changes I had to make: 1. Crust - Could not find chocolate wafers anywhere so I substituted Oreo. Which then that brought into question the amount due to different cookie and the white filling of the cookie. I crushed 14 ounces of Oreo's and kept the butter amount the same. I am not a baker of desserts so it said to bake the crust but for me it was hard to determine when its done. Mine tasted great but was so hard you couldn't hardly cut it with a fork which made it hard to eat. Once you were chewing it it wasn't any harder than an Oreo but imagine cutting an Oreo cooke with a fork...not good. Not sure if it was suppose to be that hard or if I had too many Oreos or if i cooked it too long or just the fact my substitution wasn't a good choice but it tasted great. 2. Taste - was great however I did expect a little stronger cherry flavor. Not sure if would add more jello mix or reduce cream cheese but that taste as is was great just not obvious cherry. 3. Presentation - It looked awesome but I am still a practical person. I did not use fresh cherry because to me it looked out of place and just woulnt fit with the dessert. I used a soft sweet Cherry out of a can and those look a little more like a small prune than a cherry but",
