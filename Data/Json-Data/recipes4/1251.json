But I changed several things and I liked it allot so I'm going to list what I did for 2 reasons: So you can see what I did and I want to remember this when I go to make this again (I will make it again!) Also for those of you with the thought that if you change a receipe up too much you might as well post your own...well I've tried that for yrs and have yet to have one of my submissions posted. So this is my outlet: I used 12 oz. of lrg elbow mac and 4 oz. of a mix (which included Shells Penne and Spirals.) I liked the variation that some of the other shapes provided as they all hold the sauce a little differently. I wouldn't do the whole thing in a mix but this way you ran up on another shape every other bite or so. I didn't use spag sauce but used 1 can of stewed tomatoes and 2 cans of petite diced tomates and seasoned it myself with basil oragano parsley white pepper and a few red pepper flakes (maybe more garlic than called for). I let that simmer for about 1/2 an hour. I also cooked the meat onions and garlic all together then added my tomatoe's seasoning and mushrooms. This made for a really tasty sauce which I think is a big factor in the overall recipe. After I completed the layering process I topped it off with a little bit of grated - extra sharp - cheddar cheese. The boldness of the cheese but not overwhelmingly so added a nice finish to the pasta dish. If you don't like cheese - this isn't the dish for you.",
