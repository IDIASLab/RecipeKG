Typically the first time I make a new recipe I follow the directions exactly then I tweek it the next time. With this recipe I left out the jalapeno so that I could have a base from which to determine if/how much jalapeno I'd use the next time. I also had some doubts about the tofu staying on the skewers so I doubled the sauce recipe and marinated shrimp in a separate container. I skewered the shrimp and veggies and used a grilling basket for the tofu and veggies. I also made one skewer with the tofu as per the recipe and the tofu fell off. This meal was an instant hit and the leftover portion served cold over spinach the next night was just a delicious. It's a simple meal to prepare and make.",
