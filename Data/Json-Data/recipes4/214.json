Well first I used 2 cans of crabmeat, tripled the mustard, crackers and  worchestire, added some garlic powder, minced onion, parsley and chili powder. To the fish I brushed on melted butter mixed with some lemon juice and garlic powder. To the mayo topping I used about 4 TB and added about 2 TB of sherry to smooth it out. Turned out absolutely delicious, although next time to make it more resturant quality I'll skip the mayo mixture on top and instead make a sherry cream sauce from roux, and pour it on just before serving for a more impressive presentation.",

I did not have any green bell pepper or mustard powder.  I used one tsp dijon mustard in it's place.  It turned out very well, but a little bland.  Definately needed more salt and I wish I had added some Old Bay, which I did have in my spice cabinet, but forgot about.  My family enjoyed it, but agreed it needed just a little more pizazz.  The mayo and egg yolk mixture on top was very good...reminded me of hollindaise sauce. It looked very nice on the plate, like something you'd get at a quality seafood restarant.  I will definately make this again!",

I thought it looked a little better :)  I also added salt to the fish.  Then I added several dashes of old bay and garlic to the crab mixture.  If I don't have green pepper, I use red.  It's no biggie, and it brings some color to it.  I only had a few eggs left and needed them to make something else that night, so I didn't make the topping this time but it does taste delish!!!!!! ",

Seasoned them with a mixture of melted butter,Emeril's Essence,and minced garlic. For the crab filling I used ritz crackers instead of saltines and dijon mustard in place of mustard powder. Seasoned the filling with plenty of Old Bay. I had my doubts about the sauce but I made it any way and I'm glad I did. As other members have said,it looked like an omlette on top but a very tasty omlette. This dish is on the menu at my next dinner party. No need to get all fancy with fresh crab. Canned works just fine.",

It's a good base recipe; I would use more worch. sauce, maybe even marinate the fillets in the sauce before.  The crab topping was good (still lacking some spice), but the fish was pretty bland.  I think it would work better if you baked it in a pan that was a bit too small, that way all the juices and sauce/juices don't run all over and instead get absorbed by the fish & topping.",
