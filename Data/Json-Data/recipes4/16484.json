First the ghee was not what I expected. I didn't care for the smell or the taste so much. The worst part is that the chicken stuck to the pan. May have been my pot but it doesn't seem to happen with olive or coconut oil. Second the items in the blender were so small it was hard to get it out. Third I've never shredded tomatoes before & it didn't go so well so I chopped them. Finally I think all of these problems were probably because I didn't know how to execute properly with unfamiliar ingredients & approaches. Don't know if I'll try again but definitely will try to find a good South-Asian dish because now I've got all this ghee! Hope I didn't offend anyone if so I apologize.",

I wanted the chicken to simmer longer and get to be fall off the bone fantastic so I added a cup of chicken stock to the onions and chicken and then covered it and simmered for an hour. Then I removed the lid and reduced the liquid. Then added the milk and cream and heated thru. Flavor explosions. I don t think my alterations change the flavor at all just added some good cooking time for tenderness. The flavor profile of this recipe is fabulous. I wouldn t change it a bit.

Grating the tomato is tricky - need a sharp box grater; I ended slicing two of the tomatoes in very thin strips, which turned out just fine.",
