These are very rich tasting,  and filling,  which is good because we doubled the recipe and it only made 10 pancakes. My gluten free boy rates this 9/10! These take longer to fry and are difficult to flip (especially if you flip too early) but they turn out looking like normal pancakes. So yummy!",

I didn't have heavy cream so i substituted Half & Half. Batter was thick & lumpy. Added a little extra cream vanilla & a splash of water to thin it out. Taste is actually pretty good. The texture of the coconut flour is takes a little getting used to and you can definitely taste it. Personally i think they are sweet enough & don't even need syrup.",

My hubby said he thought the texture was like eating cornbread, and I don\u2019t disagree.  The batter was so thick that I felt it necessary to thin out a bit by adding some water to it.  It was still so thick that when I ladled it on the griddle,  I had to flatten it with a spatula.  We ate them, but my hubby requested that I not make again.  Admittedly, I\u2019ve not had a lot of exposure to cooking with coconut flour, but I understand there are compromises with low-carb and gluten-free diets.  I guess the bottom line is that I\u2019ll stick with my high carb pancakes and just consider them a splurge!",
