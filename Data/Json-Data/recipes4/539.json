I used 1 3/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup heavy cream.. this made it extra creamy and yummy. I also blended in 2 cups of the suggested cheddar as well as 1 cup of provolone and 1 cup of mozzeralla...this made it even more creay and cheesy... I omitted the breadcrumb topping (TOO much breadcrumbs for me) and generously added more cheddar mozzeralla and provolone to the top before puting it into the oven... If you like easy cheesy and creamy mac and cheese..you will love this recipe with these modifications!",

No specialty cheeses. I really like the bread crumb topping. The actual mac and cheese was a little too cream cheese flavored for me. I like rich, flavorful foods and the cream cheese made it too bland for me. I'm going to keep looking around for other recipes, but if I do make this again, I'll down the cream cheese to 6oz and up the cheddar to 2 & 1/2 to 3 cups. Also, when I made this, instead of putting parsley (which I'm not fond of) in with the bread crumbs I put garlic salt and paprika. Yum!",
