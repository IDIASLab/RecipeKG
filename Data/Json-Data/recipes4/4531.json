I had a pound of chipped deli turkey so used that (didn't measure how much- used the whole pound). I added about 1/2 tsp of pepper and 1/4 tsp of salt. We all enjoyed this but next time I would maybe add another can of soup or more broth as I would have liked more \"gravy\".",

Instead of canned veggies I sauteed chopped onion celery carrot and garlic then added some frozen corn and peas and boiled potato cubes. Next I added leftover homemade pan gravy that had some mushroom in it (that had gotten quite thick in the fridge) and also added cream to replicate the canned soup. Good way to use some of that leftover gravy. Boy was it goooooooood! Try these revisions...a little extra work but still easy-and worth it!",
