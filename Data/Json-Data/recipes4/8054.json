After cooling I sliced it and toasted the slices in the oven to give it a bit more crunch and stability. I added some fresh rosemary on top right before baking but next time will add spices and herbs in the batter as written in the notes. I think a milder cheese or less vinegar may be a winner here too. Thank you for the recipe.",
