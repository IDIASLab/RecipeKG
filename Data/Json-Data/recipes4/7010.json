I used two bottles of red plus one bottle of white and doubled the ingredients. Seemed to do the trick just fine. My friend had given me a recipe years ago, but gave me pre-packaged mulling spices. This is the first time I\u2019ve made this mulled recipe from scratch. I used 24 cloves and grating the ginger didn\u2019t seem to work well, so I diced it up in little pieces. I used 6 cinnamon sticks. Heated it in the crock pot for two hours. I used a fine mesh strainer to separate the mulling spices before I bottled it all up. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!",
