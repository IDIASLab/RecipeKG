Very easy, very successful, very nice pure white, lends itself to color additions, sets well. . . Really perfect in every way. Exactly like the frosting on a professionally decorated cake.  This frosting saved a cake made from a mediocre recipe: the cake itself was dry and crumbly, but this frosting made it acceptable for serving. I have been commissioned to make a wedding cake this summer, and I already know I will use this recipe for the frosting. A million thanks, Amy! (By the way, since I had no butter flavoring on hand, I did follow one reviewer's suggestion of replaceing 1/4 cup of the shortening with unsalted butter. Perfect!)",

Use all shortening all butter or a mixture of both depending on your preference. I didn't need a perfectly white frosting so I used half butter half shortening regular vanilla and enough water for piping consistency. This falls short of 5-stars in that it should be beaten till very light and fluffy a good several minutes not just \"until well mixed.\" It WILL make a difference.",
