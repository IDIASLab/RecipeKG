I only had Quinoa on hand so that replaced Farro. Truthfully I'm betting cooked wheat berries would work too. The other modification was the walnuts. I replaced them with toasted sliced almonds due to a family food allergy. Also I used a Red Apple Balsamic. I'm sure any type of good quality balsamic would be great. I forgot to take a picture but I will next time I make it. This is a keeper.",

I plan to try it in other dishes.  One caution:  2 cups of uncooked faro makes a whole lot of cooked grain!  So be sure to check servings for this recipe - I wasn't serving a crowd and could have cut the recipe in half.  As other reviewers did, substituted almonds for walnuts and as another Easter dish had asparagus, used haricots vert for the green veggie.  Surprisingly good.  Will share with others.",

However since I did that I have found that it can be purchased from Amazon in a 3# bag for a more reasonable price per pound. http://www.amazon.com/Roland-Farro-3-lbs-Bag/dp/B0028VZEJQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1292004253&sr=1-1 However I went to their website just now and found they are out of it at this time but you can sign up to be notified when it does come in.
