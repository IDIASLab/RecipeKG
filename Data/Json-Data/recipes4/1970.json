Personally when I shrimp I place it in the marinade immediately and label the freezer bag until I am ready to use it. I place it in the refrigerator to thaw at least 24 before. As it thaws it is also marinading itself. The liquid in the bad keeps the shrimp from getting freezer burn if you elimate all the air from the bag before freezing. Everyone requests this at every grill out we attend.",
