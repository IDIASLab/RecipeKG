If you use extra-firm tofu, it gets firm enough without freezing to be shaped into patties. I added two tbs of cornstarch as an additional binding agent. I also added miso (soy bean paste) for extra flavor. Added also shiitake mushrooms stir-fried with diced carrots. These patties are good even cold. My husband, who never cared for tofu, eats them.",

I greased a two quart baking pan packed the mixture in baked it according to directions and cut it into squares instead. The end result is good and I'll probably make it again but it's really more like a casserole than a burger.",
