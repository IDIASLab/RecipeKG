I do NOT use the cooked ground sausage in this it makes it way to greasy. For easy clean-up of the flour I wet the counter with a damp cloth and lay 2 pieces of saran wrap onto it. Add a small amount of flour on plastic and roll dough. Then just pull up the plastic with no flour mess on the counter! For a quicker baking time I cook at a higher temperature 375 for 15-18 minutes. Served with Pizza Sauce I as a dipping sauce. This is a regular Friday night \"pizza\" at our house (even my kids can make it)! It cost less than a pizza chain's pizza!",
