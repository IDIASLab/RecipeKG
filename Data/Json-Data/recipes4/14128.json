The most important part of this recipe is to add the dressing to the hot potatoes. If you prefer to peel your potatoes first, it should be fine. I did it that way for years before I opened the ranch to the public.  We make this recipe for hundreds of people at a time.  Taking this step out save us a lot of time. And it gives the salad a rustic look consistent with the ranch's image.  As far as adding more calories by adding the oil, I think the flavor makes up for any extra calories.  You need less mayo for this recipe so I think it is an even swap calorie wise.   This is a recipe that you can make your own with by changing the condiments or the type of vinegar. I have been making this recipe for my family about 30 years.  I started with a bottled Italian dressing and quickly changed to my personal favorite Italian dressing.  At first I made it with corn oil, then safflower oil and finally extra virgin olive oil.   It was the first recipe I added the ranch's signature dishes when we opened ten years ago. I hope you enjoy this as much as my family has.",

The only thing I did not use were the dill pickles because I was afraid it would make the salad too tart.  I do have one question, if anyone out there can answer for me.  I do not understand why the potatoes are cooked whole and chopped after.  I found this step to be very cumbersome.  When I was trying to chop all the potatoes, it mushed some of the others.  I would think it would be better to  chopped the potatoes before cooking which would save time and make the dish easier to prepare.  Please let me know if I am missing something here.  Appreciate any comments.  Awesome recipe and I will definitely make this one again.  UPDATE:  I made this salad again for a birthday party.  I cut the potatoes into bite size pieces and cooked for 10 mins. once the water came to a boil and then proceeded with the recipe.  So much easier to do it this way.  Also, I had rave reviews and some even said this was the best potato salad they had ever eaten.  Thanks for making me look like a gourmet chef!",

Every time I make I add a different kind of Italian type dressing , like Roasted Red Pepper, Light Asiago and Parmesan, Balsamic, while they are hot  and let sit to absorb the flavors before adding mayo, adds a different flavor. Always come home with an empty bowl.  Also, must be a Northern thing, we add hard cooked eggs which just add to a great flavor and texture.  This recipe stands alone but when short on time, this is an alternative. Wedo not add dill pickles, the dressing takes care of that.",

As for the mayo I was going to follow the recipe exactly as written but added the mayo gradually. I'm glad I did this and didn't just dump it in because by the time I got to 1 1/2 cups there was plenty. 3 cups would've been way too much.
