This is reminiscent of scalloped potatoes but with a very unique and delicious twist. I would use the oven next time as the sauce leaked out of the (well sealed) foil which made turning the packet impossible so I had issues with the whole thing sticking terribly to the foil. I would cover my casserole pan the entire time they're in the oven though as I wouldn't want to compromise the incredible creaminess and flavor of the sauce and potatoes this must be due to the 'steaming' these get in the foil packet. Thanks for submitting a great recipe.",

For the sauce I added garlic powder and used a combination of browned flour and all-purpose. Also added sliced mushrooms, red bell pepper and green onions. We sliced the potatoes instead of dicing. We baked it in the oven at 350F for an hour, covered with aluminum foil. We think it might get more kick from some grainy Dijon mustard. EDIT: Made it again, and it's way better! I sauteed about two teaspoons of minced garlic in the butter before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients. I did let the flour lightly brown. I added about one or two tablespoons of grainy (or old-fashioned) Dijon mustard. The sauce will initially taste salty on its own, but once added to the potatoes and whatever other veggies you're using that saltiness will dissipate. It is so good made this way! The second time we cooked in the oven with a roast that was rubbed with Dijonnaise (a combination of Dijon mustard and mayonnaise) and 'All-Around Spice Rub' from AR. We did slice it up as it was not down after an hour then browned the slices in a pan. Moist and juicy, even the next day. YUM.",
