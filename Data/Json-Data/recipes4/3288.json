                "reviewBody": "This dip was a big hit at our family's Thanksgiving dinner. The flavors are bold and may be a bit intimidating for the sensitive tasters but clearly a standout on the appetizer table. I served the dip with Frito Corn Chip Scoops which have a reputation of overpowering the flavor of the dip. No such problem here. I prepared the sausage/onion hash before hand. After draining and cooling transferred to a Rubbermaid 2.4qt container mixed in the RoTel then placed the cubed cream cheese on top and refrigerated. This transported well to the event and took 5 minutes heating in the microwave stirring and ready to serve. This would do best in a fondue pot or chafing dish to keep it hot during serving. When well mixed the dip sort of looks like old oatmeal or cream ground beef (military veterans will identify this as S.O.S.) so it is clear that the visual presentation requires chopped chives. I recommend keeping the chives on the large side. I wonder if adding thin slices of seeded Jalepenio Green Pepper and Red Pepper might add some visual attractiveness? Great receipe Kate-K! Thanks for the good eats.",
