That being said after an hour of simmering the rice it still had a hint of crunch to it but the chicken broth was all evaporated/soaked up. Next time I will try adding about 4 more ounces of broth and simmering a bit longer. Really love the flavor though! And that the recipe uses brown rice - finally!!!!",
