The rub was STILL very hot! I love spicy foods but the heat on the outside of the chop just overpowered the delicious stuffing inside. All I tasted was the spicy rub. It would be better as 2 separate recipes. If I make these again I would either use a thinner chop with just the rub and no stuffing if i'm in the mood for spicy; or omit the rub and just stuff it with the stuffing recipe and brush the outside with some of the pesto. I'd also substitute something for the pine nuts. They didnt seem to add much to the flavor for the amount of money it costs for them.",

I have never written a review before as I feel the previous reviews often sum up my thoughts. But this required one. While the reviews for this recipe do just that, I had to come on and state what a phenomenal recipe this just is. It had me literally licking my plate at the end wondering when I could make them again.\nMy fiance said that she would be very happy had she received this dish at our favorite restaurant that we always go to in DC. This is a huge complement as she never dares to compare anything to this restaurant. \n\nBased off the previous reviews I did reduce my crushed red pepper to ~1/3 Tsp. But it all has to do with your tolerance and desires to spice. Anyways, GREAT RECIPE. Will be making it again soon. Thank you.",
