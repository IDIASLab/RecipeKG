        "description": "This is a great alternative to any potato side dish. Cauliflower has half the calories of potatoes and one-tenth the simple carbohydrates - so you can get your calories where you want to, from the cheese and butter! This recipe is so savory you just might prefer it to potatoes - my family certainly does. Have it with a salad and a nice steak. Like most of my recipes, this one feels a little tedious and plods along the first time you make it. However, it really is quite simple and so packed with flavor that you can't go wrong!",
