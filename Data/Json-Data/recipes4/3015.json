You can use it right from the fridge and it is actually easier to cut from a cold stick of butter than when it's soft. And garlic powder works great too since the boullion is salty. We love ours a really dark color - almost burnt. Sometimes they take an hour and sometimes I leave them on for an hour and 15 minutes. It really depends on the grill. Hope you enjoy!",

Heated some oil in a pan on medium heat (not too much though - maybe about 1 tbsp?). 3. Added 1 cup of chopped onion. Don't really remember how long I cooked them for exactly. Maybe 10 minutes or until slightly soft. 4. Added in 1 tbsp butter and 1/2 tsp of beef bouillon granules (which was about 1/2 a cube for me). 5. Sprinkled with garlic POWDER and pepper. The bouillon is already pretty salty so just start there and add salt to taste. 6. Turned to low-medium and cooked/stirred until ready to use (probably less than 25 minutes)!!",
