When I used my hand mixer to blend it some small bits remained intact but that added a nice texture. If you prefer a totally creamy soup you would have to use a food processor. The curry wasn't too hot but it does creep up on you a little more with every spoonful so next time I'll decrease the amount of curry but only very slightly. This is the type of soup one would be served in an upscale restaurant. Thanks for this unique sophisticated recipe!",
