The first time I seasoned it with \"grains of paradise\" (an african pepper); the second time I used italian seasoning & left out the carrots & onions. Both times I used rice vinegar instead of distilled & followed the suggestion of one reviewer to use 1/4 cup each of vinegar olive oil & water; also used way less salt (about 1/2 tsp). I left out the feta cheese both times because I wanted a plain slaw. If I want to do italian again I would probably choose to use a combination of just basil & marjoram which would suit my tastes better. Red cabbage also works well. It is a very refreshing salad. This recipe is a definite keeper & I will be using it a lot.",
