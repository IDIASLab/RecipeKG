This soup surprised the heck out of me because its \u201cskinny\u201d ingredients (and I even used skim milk) tasted a bit decadent and was filling.  I used Wondra\u00ae flour and whisked it into the water-milk mixture to be sure I had no lumps in the soup.  My cubed potatoes were small size, so they were tender in fewer than 20 minutes.  The bacon on its own is a subtle layer of flavor, but this is just a good combination of ingredients.  This was lunch today, and my hubby enjoyed it as much as I did.  We love mushroom soup, I\u2019ve tried a lot of recipes, and this one ranks right up there with the best  where I\u2019ve used heavy cream or half-and-half.   And thanks, yajuwen, for quantifying every line item for this soup (well-written), so there\u2019s no guessing involved; this one\u2019s a keeper!  \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 UPDATE 4.18.17 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022  Had no fresh thyme, so I just used dried which worked fine.  Whenever I get a craving for decadent cream of mushroom soup, I head to this recipe.  It simply never lets me down, and yet, I can enjoy it guilt free!",
