I first made the recipe with venison and doubled the jalapenos then stuffed collagen casings and smoked them on my smoker with hickory chips. They turned out really well but I thought they could have had more kick to them. I just made this recipe with lean ground beef and it turned out even better. I still used the collagen casings and smoked with hickory chips but I added even more cheddar and jalapenos. Make sure you leave some of the membrane in the jalapenos if you want more heat. This time I used 4 Jalapenos and 4 Serano peppers and a 16 ounce block of extra sharp cheddar for 5 pounds of ground beef. It turned out amazing with a lot more flavor.",
