The marinade, when boiled and reduced, cooks all the rawness of the chicken and makes it safe for consumption. When you add the BBQ sauce to the thickened marinade, it makes a glaze like sauce that just  bumps up the already yummy grilled chicken to a whole different level. You can change the flavor of the sauce by changing the kind of BBQ sauce you use. I plan on using a spicy BBQ sauce next time, but any BBQ sauce will make it a winner dinner. I can always tell when dinner is a hit...my husband says it is good without me asking and goes for seconds. He thinks using Guiness beer next time is called for...I think any dark beer will work!!!!",

I was staring at a package of BLSL chicken thighs trying to be inventive when I happened on this recipe. I used homemade sazon seasoning because all I could find in the stores had MSG and I actually had achiote from the gift exchange and my SIL's homemade version of Big Daddy's BBQ sauce. This was a hands down winner and will be made often this grilling season. Thanks Patty!",

The only BBQ sauce I use is Gates (Kansas City brand and the best around in my opinion) and it is orange-y too so that just made it extra special. I'll admit that I went lightly on the sauce during the grilling and I also used skinless thighs but only due to our preference.  The end result was overall excellent flavor that did not overpower the chicken yet you could still gently pick up on the beer and bbq sauce flavor. Love it Patty Cakes and thank you for sharing!",
