I used frozen sweet white corn (I find that it's not as crunchy and tastes much more fresh than canned, which I just refuse to make) in a heated skillet, no olive or vegetable oil, no butter.  Just cooked the corn, added 3/4ths of a thing of cream cheese, and added the jalapenos.  My family is from Louisiana (Cajun, baby!) so we like spicy things--I added all the jalepenos the recipe called for, and kinda wish I'd added more.  I love that spicy kick to it.  Anyway, was extremely unique--nothing I EVER would have thought to try, so I really enjoyed making it and serving it to my family.  I will definitely give this a try again, although next time will use reduced fat cream cheese to cut out those unnecessary and unhealthy extra calories.  I highly recommend giving this a shot!  Thanks so much for the unique recipe!",
