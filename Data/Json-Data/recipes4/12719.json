Used Dashi broth rather than water dried shrimp rather than bacon didn t mix in the ginger but used it as a condiment (BTW- don t use the type of pickled ginger you get with your sushi. There is another kind that is a deep red that is cut into little sticks) chopped the cabbage rather than sliced it added c chopped green onion and topped with Okonomiyaki sauce Kewpie mayonnaise (Japanese) and Aonori (green dried seaweed powder). My first batch needed to be cooked a little longer a little too sticky. The second batch which was topped also with an egg came out just perfect. Boy brings back memories! Thanks!",
