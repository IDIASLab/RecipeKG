I didn't use so much garlic (I tone it down for hubby) and I used milk instead of half and half. Instead of grilling (which I'm sure would be great but I wasn't going to fire up the grill for it) I toasted the bread and spread the topping, as it said, and then broiled it in the toaster oven until it got slightly brown. Watch it though the topping burns quickly.  Easy and has ingredients I usually have on hand. I will make it again.",
