I bought it and liked it, but figured I'd try making it myself.  My first batch was made just as the recipe suggests and to be honest I was NOT impressed.  For my second batch I made these changes.\r\n\r\n1) Boil all ingredients (except milk) for 10 minutes\r\n2) Simmer (lid on) for 25-30 minutes\r\n3) remove from heat and let sit for another 30 minutes (lid on)\r\n4) Squeeze any water out of the tea bags and strain the whole mixture.  This leaves you with 1-1.4 cups of concentrate.\r\n\r\nIn case you didn't notice, I omitted the milk completely.  My end result was a concentrate similar to the Tazo concentrate available at Starbucks, but it actually tasted BETTER in a side-by-side comparison.  It tastes a bit stronger, and sweeter.\r\n",

I add orange peel and peppercorns  to my spice bag.     Tea is supposed to be steeped, not boiled, so after the spices are boiled with the water and honey, I turn off the heat and add the tea bags to steep.    After the tea has steeped to my preferred strength, I remove the tea bags.  Then I add the milk and bring to a light simmer and then immediately remove from heat.  ONLY then, do I add vanilla, as vanilla looses a lot of its flavor when boiled.  I've seen this exact recipe on an Indian website several years back.  Still good, though, and as close to what you can find in an actual coffee shop.",

If you are getting a bitter drink try leaving out the tea until after the water has boiled then adding the tea and letting it steep off heat for 3-4 minutes. Boiling tea brings all the tannins out and they are terribly bitter. Next time I will probably add more of all the spices and add black pepper since I like my chai robust. But the recipe is very good as is and much better than forking over 4 for a box of concentrate at the store. (I'm leaving out the milk and keeping the spice/tea/honey mix in the fridge for chai emergencies!)",
