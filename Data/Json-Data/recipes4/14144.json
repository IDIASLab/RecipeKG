If you don't it passes through the body without releasing any of it's wonderful omega's. I use an ordinary small coffee grinder that I keep exclusively for spices. At any rate this is a very versatile recipe. The prunes and raisins can be replaced with your favorite fruit or nuts almost in infinite combinations. I was thinking this is a great take to work recipe. Just add hot water from the tap at the coffee machine and microwave for a minute or two.",
