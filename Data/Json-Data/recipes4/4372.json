I only had a few tbsp of bottled dressing so I improvised with EVOO, fresh lemon juice, scallion onions, 1 tsp crushed sage, 1tbsp crushed oregano, 4 large minced garlic cloves and  cracked pepper for the marinade. Used kalamata olives for a more authentic Greek taste and threw in 2 tbsp of bottled sundried tomates I had to use up. I had a 1lb Jurrasic Park sized chicken breast that I pounded out and stuffed with all of the filling ingreduents and baked for 45 mins.  Perfection! Definitely will make again. Served with orzo cooked in my homemade chicken stock and a Greek salad.",
