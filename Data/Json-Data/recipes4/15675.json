Personally I think it was very clever to include the cream cheese in the recipe because it gave it such a smooth delicious flavor and added some tartness. It was very unique and I nor my family have ever had banana pudding this way but it turned out so good that my grandmother and mom who are the cooking gurus in the family have requested that I make it at our next family functions. I didn't get to include the raspberries because I bought a bad batch but the rest of the desert was so great I'm sure either way it will be delicious time and time again. I'm never making banana pudding the same way I did before. Thanks for the great recipe!",
