It makes kielbasa worth stocking up on when it goes on sale and uses basic/cheap ingredients overall.  Vary the vegetables depending on what you have on hand. For example add/replace broccoli with a can of corn and/or peas, etc. If you like a little heat, sprinkle a little hot sauce on top after it's cooked. This should make about 4 servings, but it almost always turns out to be split into 2 large servings between the me and the boyfriend. We like to crisp up/brown the kielbasa slightly before adding the vegetables.",

It only takes a minute or so to cook chopped onion, the kielbasa was heated through in 3 minutes, and my potatoes and broccoli were ready after 15-20 minutes. So this is a great recipe that can be accomplished in 30 minutes or less! \nA couple of tips: after you cut the broccoli and potatoes, put them in a bowl with some olive oil, salt, and pepper, so they \"marinate\" while you chop and cook the onion and meat. And add a little chicken broth to the pan while everything is cooking to add more flavor (just to coat the bottom). Also, I used turkey kielbasa, which has great flavor and not a lot of calories. Enjoy!",

Luna also mentioned replacing veggies, so instead of potatoes, I used a large bag of frozen broccoli/cauliflower for a low-carb alternative. The kielbasa is what MAKES this dish flavorful, so I would definitely not use a turkey/chicken or low-fat alternative unless planning on drastically increasing seasoning, which would defeat the purpose of this stupid-easy, excellent meal!",

Honestly I haven't made it exactly the way the poster had done it but I'm sure it's good that way too. Some of the changes were for convenience some to get flavor (a little kick). Here are the changes is: -Used turkey kielbasa and cooked for much longer than 5 min (probably like 15 - it took a long time to get nice and brown) -Used two potatoes instead of three (1 sweet; 1 regular) -pinch of paprika - 1.4 teaspoons of crushed red pepper -2 cloves garlic -Added frozen broccoli florets and frozen bag mix (with green beans corn and carrots) -After browning the kielbasa I added all the vegetables. Put in a cup of water placed on lid and turn stove down to a simmer for 30ish min. This allowed the potatoes to thoroughly cook. Next time I think I'll only use one potato and add more of the healthy veggies.",
