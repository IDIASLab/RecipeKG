I also cook bacon until crisp then cook the onions and sausage in the fat. I drain the fat when done. I cook kale until just barely cooked.

Replaced the sausage with Turkey sausage replaced the cream (who needs the fat) with 1 cup of 2% milk. Having the leftovers tonight so added 2 cans of whole clams with their juice so it'll be like clam chowder with a twist. Serving it with crusty French bread. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.",
