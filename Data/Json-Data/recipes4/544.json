I omitted the egg wash, as the lemonade marinade made the crumbs adhere well. I crushed my crackers up in a zipper type bag, added seasonings (LOTS of garlic powder, lemon pepper, paprika and onion powder), then added the chicken pieces two at a time. I also lightly coated a glass baking dish with vegetable spray. I added the coated chicken, sprinkled parmasen cheese evenly over the chicken, I melted 1/4 cup of butter and drizzled that over the top. Cooked it at 375 for 30 minutes. My whole family loved this! I served it with buttered parsley noodles n green peas. No leftovers at all! Think next time I'll have to double the recipe. This was a moist and very tender dish, very flavorful and was not greasy or extreme butter tasting either. Very easy to make too. I think I'll make up crushed crackers/seasoning baggies and have them ready to roll in my pantry on very busy nights! Thanks Heather!!! :o)",

I generally hate white meat but decided to stick to the recipe here and used boneless breast filets, and I\u2019m glad I did because it wouldn\u2019t have been as pretty with dark meat. After reading myriad reviews here, I made a couple changes: I used an 8X8 Pyrex dish so the juices would stay put, I used only 1/2 of the required butter which was plenty, and I added about 1/4 cup of flour to the cracker crumbs so they\u2019d adhere to the chicken better. The end result looked like KFC extra crispy chicken but tasted like pure heaven on a plate! Even my picky 2 year old loved it (when he saw his cubed portions, he exclaimed \"nuggets!\" and promptly devoured them.) This is definitely going into the regular rotation!",

I made the preparation easier by crushing the crackers in a gallon-size zip-lock bag and using my rolling pin on them -- my kids had fun helping--then adding spices (garlic and onion powder, a bit of salt and paprika)& shaking. After coating the chicken in the beaten egg, I put a few pieces at a time into the bag \"shake 'n bake\" style, shaking and pressing the crackers into the chicken, then pressing in more crumbs after I put the chicken in the baking dish. After cutting and adding the butter, on a whim I poured in a bit of white wine I had in the fridge and placed about 6 large cloves of garlic, sliced in half, around the chicken. The chicken smelled sooo good while baking and the garlicky butter sauce was delicous over noodles. I cut my chicken breasts in half, so next time will reduce the cooking time to 30-35 mins. Will definitely made it again, family loved it and is good enough (not to mention easy!) for company.",

Italian seasoning to the cracker crumbs, cut the butter to 1/4 cup and baked in a glass dish.  I also flipped the chicken over about halfway through the cooking time.  I used 3 very large boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut each in half.  My husband and I both loved this recipe!  The chicken came out so moist and juicy, I can't wait to make this one again.  I am planning on serving this at a slumber party for 8-10 year old girls also, I will use chicken tenders and various dipping sauces like honey mustard and BBQ.  Excellent recipe Heather, Thanks!",
