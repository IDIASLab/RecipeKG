The only exception is that I didn't have any cloved garlic, so I used 2 tablespoons of dried/minced garlic. It was magnificent.   I used this marinade with 2 8oz steaks, and it was more than enough.   Thank you JimChicago and Tennessee for your recipe and input!",

I admit it didn't taste the way I expected it to taste, but that's rather a good thing, because I was afraid it would taste too much like soy sauce or teryaki.:-)  Half the recipe was enough for 3lbs of steaks.  I used the ziplock method.",
