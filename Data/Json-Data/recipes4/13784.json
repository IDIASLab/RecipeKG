I've never made crackers before and it should go without saying that the final product depends on how thick you roll them and how long you bake them.  Mine were all over the board.  I rolled the first batch too thick and they turned out dense and heavy with an almost cookie like texture.  The thinner I rolled them, the crispier the wafer.  The longer I baked them, the crispier the wafer.  In all honesty, I actually preferred them a little dense.  The caraway flavor stood out more compared  to those that were cripsy and made for an irresistible snack.",

I used olive oil, ww flour for the white, 1/2 the salt called for, I didn't have onion  or garlic powder so I squeezed in two or three nice size cloves of garlic.  I needed more water as well.  After rolling it out I put my pepper mill on as course as it would go and ground lots of pepper on top then gently rolled the rolling pin over it to push the black pepper in.   Baking took a little longer.  yummy and the pepper goes especially well with cheese.",
