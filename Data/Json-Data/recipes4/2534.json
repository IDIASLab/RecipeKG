I only had catfish 'nuggets' that are just odds and ends pieces of catfish. I also had some honey-orange dijon mustard that just was fabulous with this. Such few ingredients make this so simple and the flavors blend so nicely. I love garlic but I stuck with the amt. specified in the recipe because I didn't want to overpower the other flavors. It was perfect. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again. It also is a very inexpensive dish to make and can be made in a jiffy with no grease-splattered stove to clean up afterwards. Thanks so much! I served this with orange rice and garlic broccoli also from this site. A wonderful meal.",
