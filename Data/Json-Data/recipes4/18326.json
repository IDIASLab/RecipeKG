Interesting flavor and I enjoyed the crunch of the cashews and the celery but putting the rice in a separate pot would have ensured it all cooked and a quick stir-fry would have kept the peppers nice and crunchy too. If I decide to stir-fry it I will thicken the sauce with a bit of arrowroot to keep it gluten-free. I prepared exactly as written including the cooking time and temperature except for one thing: I forgot to garnish with scallions because they did not appear in the ingredient list. They might have helped the appearance but I didn't miss the flavor.",

I would double the rice to ensure there is enough food for 4 though. Everything was good. Peppers and celery stayed tasty. Spices mingled well. Cashews added separately was perfect. Going to cook it for friends who are gluten/dairy intolerant now. Thanks!!",
