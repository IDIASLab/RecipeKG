Since we enjoy the fish so much I knew we would love this as well. Very clean straight forward flavor from the seafood and lemon-butter. Perfect light meal for the upcoming hot evenings. The only changes we made were that we used less of each type of seafood in each serving didn't really count the number of shrimp or mussels (used in place of clams) only placed 3 large sea scallops in each packet and 2 small pieces of corn in each. Also drizzled approx 2 Tbsp of white wine over everything before closing each. Super fast and easy with excellent results. This will be a regular weeknight dinner as well as served to impress company here this summer. Thanks for sharing!",
