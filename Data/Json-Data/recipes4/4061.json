I chose this recipe as a vegetable side dish because I was so very low on ingredients before grocery shopping day and I was trying to use up items I had in the pantry. Only 2 changes I made was I used regular cut green beans not the French style and I also topped this with French fried onions because we were out of the crackers. I baked this for 45 minutes but I did loosely cover with foil the last 20 minutes so the topping didn't get too brown. Thanks for sharing a simple yet tasty quick side:)",

No need to put so much butter on top I sprinkled the cracker crumbs and just dotted the top with about 2 tablespoons of butter. Great stuff!",

It got tossed out unfortunately. I think the problem was that with both the canned vegetables and then the soup all that could be tasted was salt! And even though I chopped the onions very small after the recommended cooking time they were still crunchy! And the ingredients did not seem to transform themselves into anything more than they really were vegetables mixed in sour cream and cheese. The only thing I did different was use regular square crackers. This recipe does have quite a few high ratings. I am not sure what I did wrong or if it is mainly my taste buds when it comes to canned vegetables and sour cream? I really wanted to like this.",
