I would have assumed this were a cookie recipe had it not been for the other review and the description mentioning \"for strawberry shortcake or even peach shortcake.\" So I made this for strawberry shortcakes. The dough was so wet and sticky to work with that I just dropped it onto the bakesheet and formed it into circles. Cooked up to little puffed cakey cookies and tasted fine as well but I think I'll stick with my usual shortbread recipe for cookies and usual biscuit recipe for shortcakes. Thanks for the try.",
