The only changes I made were to add in some crushed garlic while sauteeing the onions using 20 oz. of mushrooms using 1 cup of wine and sprinkling in some pepper at the start of simmering. Plenty of sauce and thickening with the water/cornstarch slurry is no problem. We served over egg noodles and mixed in some green peas too. The leftover beef and sauce is destined for a lovely Shepherd's Pie this weekend. Love this recipe.",

I lightly coated the meat with flour and browned as suggested by other users. I sliced the onions and fresh mushrooms and put into a slow cooker along with the meat soup (I doubled the sauce and used 1 can golden mushroom and 1 can 99% fat free cream of mushroom soup) and 1 cup of wine (I also used the wine to de-glaze the pan I browned the meat in before adding to the slow cooker. Those brown bits add alot of flavor). I also added 2 garlic cloves pressed to the mixture (I love garlic!). I cooked everything in the slow cooker on low for about 4 hours and served over egg noodles and topped with freshly choppped parsley.",

I like to use a cheap cut of meat with this (you CAN use beef or pork stew meat and have it come out fabulously and fake it I do it all the time) and let it simmer in the sauce for an hour. The longer it simmers the more tender the meat gets. Right before serving I like to add a good amount of sour cream and a teaspoon each of dried oregano and dried basil. This doubles well and the leftovers always reheat wonderfully. We like this best over buttered egg noodles. NOTE: Any Campbell's mushroom soup will work in this recipe I like to use the \"beefy mushroom\" soup if I have it on hand.",

I also added some thyme and served over egg noodles with chopped parsley as a garnish. Great flavor and easy. Would transfer easily to a slow cooker recipe. By the way it will look very thick when you first mix it all t ogether. Do not worry the sauce will thin as it simmers. No need to add additional liquid with 2 cans of soup and a cup of wine. Oh I also added a tsp of minced garlic to the oil in which the meat was seared as others suggested. This one is a defnite keeper.",

When you mix everything together, the sauce looks very pink, but after simmering, it is brown. I simmered uncovered after 2 hours to thicken the sauce, and served over baked potatoes.

I added an extra can of mushroom soup and an extra splash of wine (I used burgundy cooking wine). It made plenty of sauce. I also omitted the butter (by accident) but it still tasted great! I also baked it at 300 for an hour and a half instead of using a dutch oven. I used horrible tough steaks and they turned out tender and juicy with this recipe. This recipe smelled so good while it was cooking and was perfect served on top of rice. I will definitely be making this recipe again. Thanks for the great recipe!!",
