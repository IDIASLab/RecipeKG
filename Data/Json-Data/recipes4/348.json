I also combined tips I followed from several reviewers and adapted my recipe as follows: I made meatballs placed them on an ungreased nonstick cookie sheet and baked them for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. I added 1 tsp each of ketchup dijon mustard and worcestershire 1/4 tsp each of Chinese spice and ground ginger and added some black pepper. But I think the black pepper was overwhelming. I'll omit it next time. The recommendation for coordinating this with the Sweet and Sour Sauce II recipe was a good one. That's what I used to go with the meatballs and served over white rice. Both my toddlers enjoyed this. DH loved it. I'll definitely be making this again.",

The only change I made was using 1/2 of plain breadcrumbs and 1/2 of Italian-style breadcrumbs (I ran out of the plain). I also took other reviewer's suggestions and made the sweet & sour sauce II and we think it's better than most bottled sweet & sour sauce. We couldn't believe how great the combination was. Served with wild-rice and stir-fried broccoli made it a wonderful meal. Thanks Linda for a great post! It will become a regular in our house!",
