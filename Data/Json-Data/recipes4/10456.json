I then use the beans in things like burritos, enchiladas or smother rice with them.  No soaking! Just put them in the crock pot for 4-8 hours and let them cook.  They always come out just right!  Sometimes I omit the wine, vinegar and bellpeppers (just a personal preference, but it's okay w/them).  The beans have a \"mexi-type\" flavor.  I didn't have a problem with \"tough\" beans...but if you are skeptical, leave the salt out!  **UPDATE**:  I've made this recipe MANY times now and I truly appreciate this recipe! I've used it to cook beans for several other recipes on this site that require \"canned beans\" as well as fresh.  The beans freeze nicely for later use.  This is a great BASIC recipe that allows you to add as many or as few extras to it and it's still good.  You can even use balsamic vinegar instead of distilled vinegar. The best part is that this is SO healthy!  It has no additives or preservatives (you can barely find that these days)and it cost pennies to make!!  One crockpot of these beans can make a few different meals!  ENJOY",

This would eliminate the salt making the beans \"tough\". The quick soak is simply: rinse dried beans in colander. Put dried beans into a stock pot covered with water, bring to boil (with lid off), boil for three minutes. After they've boiled the three minutes let soak for only one hour, with the lid on. A lot can be done in an hour! When the hour is over rinse again & proceed with your recipe. I've never had a problem with this method. And it actually helps to eliminate the problem (gas) most people associate with beans. I doubled this recipe today & we are already enjoying it! Very good flavor. I did add some more spices though, not too many.",

I also gave it a good glug of chicken broth to help keep the beans moist while they simmered (the truth be told a little bacon grease too!), and also added the wine at this point. The idea of adding the wine at the end without cooking off the alcohol didn\u2019t appeal to me.  Besides, simmering the beans WITH the wine helps give them good flavor!  I did add the vinegar at the end, which really served to brighten the flavor as well.  I simmered them about 20 minutes, basically the time it took to heat the chicken enchiladas I served them with.   I liked these dressed up black beans and they worked well with the enchiladas.",
