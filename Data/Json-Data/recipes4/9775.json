I only add one bag of hashbrowns one box of chicken broth and then enough water to make sure we have plenty of soup. I let that cook all day. 30-45 minutes before serving I add the rest of the ingredients and use some milk to mix with corn starch for thickening. I also add shredded cheese and garlic! It is amazing and so yummy!",
