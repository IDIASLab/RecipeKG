I was hesitant to make them for a party because I am known as the Martha Stewart of my group of friends and I usually spend lots of time and effort on everything I make. I didn't want to ruin my reputation by making something easy but I was running out of time! For this recipe I used two 10\" tortillas for each quesadilla-- one on the bottom and one on top. When they were done I cut them with a pizza cutter for cute pizza-slice-shaped appetizers. For the sauce in the quesadillas I used my favorite pizza sauce recipe: 3 (8 oz) cans of tomato sauce 1 (6 oz) can of tomato paste 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 1/2 teaspoons dried marjoram 1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil 1 teaspoon garlic salt and 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon white sugar. (Combine all in saucepan bring to a simmer to combine flavors and adjust seasonings to taste. Use leftovers dipping sauce for the quesadillas!) I used mozzerella cheese pepperoni sun-dried tomatoes and sliced italian sausage links inside and they were sooooooooo good. One thing to note-- these hold together really well if you put cheese down as the first layer (after sauce) and again as the last layer after the other ingredients. Everyone thought these were great. I called them PIZZADILLAS. Yum yum!",

We used cheddar and mozzerella cheese and we added olives and sauteed mushrooms with the pepperoni for \"toppings\" Also so we don't burn them we cook on the stove until the tortilla is golden and then put the on a cookie sheet in a heated oven. That way the cheese melts and they stay warm while the others are be cooked. Thanks for the recipe!!",

I used \"Pasta/Pizza Sauce\" from this site and opted to cook these in the oven @ 375 for about 15 minutes on a foil lined baking sheet. I sprayed a little Pam so nothing would stick. I used an Italian cheese blend and used a combination of pepperoni and salami. I left the sauce on the side for dipping and these were oh so good!
