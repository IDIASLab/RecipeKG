Otherwise the onions still stay crunchy when youve got them out of the oven.\n\n2) You dont have to layer it if you dont want to. Its just if you need to be particularly careful over presentation.\n\n3) In the last 5 minutes of cooking, take the lid off the casserole dish, to allow the parmesan to brown slightly\n\n4) Leave the casserole lid off for the last 15 minutes of cooking, to try to evaporate the liquid that stores up at the bottom of the pan. Otherwise, you'll end up with a rataouille soup!\n\nAnyway, thanks for sharing!",

I first cooked garlic and onion in olive oil, added the rest of the ingredients, put the cover on and cooked until the vegetables were tender (about 30+ minutes). Some changes I have made: One large tomato and one can of diced tomato instead of 2 tomatoes, added some  basil, pinch of red pepper flakes and a drizzle of olive oil at the end, and sprinkled freshly grated romano cheese right before serving instead of mixing parmesan into the vegetables.\n\nWill make it again!",

I did make a few changes: used 1 zucchini & 1 yellow squash, a whole 12 oz pkg of mushrooms,sliced, no green pepper (forgot to buy it, but don't really care for it anyway-may try red or orange next time), sprinkled a mix of chopped fresh parsley, basil & oregano over each layer, used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh (but can't wait to try it with fresh tomatoes from the garden!), and added browned italian style turkey sausage for my meat-loving guys.  I also forgot the parmesan on some of the layers, but added some shredded mozzarella on the top for the last 5 minutes or so of baking. \nI used a 9x13 baking dish, and it just barely fit.  As noted by other reviewers, 45 min didn't seem long enough, so I baked it for about 60, covered part of the time.\nI served this over brown rice, which soaked up all that yummy liquid, and a nice Tuscan bread.  Family loved it . . . will definitely make this again with all the fresh veggies from garden.  Thanks for sharing!",

First, use a lot of eggplant (use a large eggplant, not a small or medium) as this is the \"top\" flavor. Press the garlic rather than mince for a bold garlic flavor in the eggplant. Remove the eggplant from the saute pan then lightly brown the onions in the same pan. If it's sticky, add a little water, but be sure to keep the browned bits from the eggplant/garlic mixture. This flavors the onions like you can't believe. Use both yellow and green zucchini squash if you can. Use FRESHLY grated Parmesan cheese. Use red, orange, or yellow bell pepper instead of the green to add a nice sweetness. Other than than, follow the recipe as written. It's really yummy!",
