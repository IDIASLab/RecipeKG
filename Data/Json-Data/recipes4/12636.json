I used a three pound rump roast, only two packages (.67 oz each) of italian dressing mix and I put the entire jar and juices of the pepperoncini in with the roast from the get go.  I cooked it on high in the crockpot for 4 hours and then on low for 4-5 hours.  The meat just fell apart!  It was absolutley incredible!  I used french bread instead of buns, which I buttered and placed in a pan to brown.  I put some juice into a small bowl to dip the sandwich in.  Thank you for the recipe!",

Added all peppers in half way thru the cooking process: after about 3-4 hours so the flavor soaked into beef.  Used 2 instead of 3 dressing mixes (from the advice of others). Brushed the hoagies very lightly with olive oil,   spinkled a bit of garlic powder & salt on them, toasted then added shredded meat and provolone & broiled until melted--(toasting the hoagies helped prevent them from getting too soggie when juice was poured over them) .  Put the hoagies in a bowl, added pepperoncinis to taste and laddled the unbelievable great juice over it.  Excellent!!!  I did go to great lengths after the meat was done to pull it out and shred it to make sure all the fat was removed and this took a LONG time. But this is not necessary just my preference.",

This recipe is as close as it gets. I read the other reviews first and altered the recipe accordingly. I bought a 1.75 lb. chuck roast. I used 2 C of Beef stock instead of water, 1 packet of dry italian italian salad dressing mix, 1/2 jar of pepperoncini juice (served the peppers on the side), 3 bulbs of garlic and I threw in some italian seasoning and addt'l Oregano. I could not insult this recipe by putting it on a hamburger bun, so I found some great pane rolls at the bakery and they were perfect. I cooked on high for 4 hrs and 2 more hours on low. My husband said this was the best tasting roast meat he has ever had. I will be making this recipe again and again. Thank you!!!",

What's great about it too is it's very inexpensive and makes a lot. I added about 2 tsp. of minced garlic from the jar and used only 2 (1 ounce) packed of Good Seasons Italian dressing mix. Instead of a whole cup of water I used about 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar to cut heat from the peppers and to cover more of the roast. I also added two vidalia onions that I quarted and added half way through cooking. I cooked this on low for 8 hours and the smell was heavenly. We served this on toasted hoagie rolls with provolone cheese. Everyone loved it! Thanks Randi for a great recipe!",
