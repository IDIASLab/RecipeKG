The pan roasted halibut becomes nicely golden brown and caramelized, while the sauce, although it includes no lemon juice, is inspired by that used in the  classic Veal or Chicken Piccata. Simple to prepare, remarkably pretty presentation, with delicious results. I served this with rice, but a side of pasta with garlic and olive oil would also be a perfect complement.",

If your weary about capers dont add the full 3 tbsp add only one tbsp the caper liquid and cooking of them will add the taste that is required.",
