                "reviewBody": "This is an easy and pretty tasty solution to your bread needs if you are gluten free. It almost tastes like a cheese omelette but the texture is like a soft bread roll. I took heed of the submitter's notes because I used real - Italian - fresh mozzarella and think this may have influenced the outcome drastically-so keep this in mind if your are using low moisture mozzarella. Apart from the taste being quite nice the mixture was influenced by the amount of liquid in the mozzarella (no I'm not talking about the liquid it swims in that should be drained off first). American fresh mozzarella has a considerably lower moisture than the real stuff. So not only did I not need ANY milk but I ended up having to add about 1/4 cup of tapioca starch just to make it workable. I made a half batch and cut it into two ciabatte. They melted into a puddle once they got into the oven. So maybe chilling the dough first would be a good idea. They took the whole 15 minutes to cook. Next time I will chill the dough I will make them into 4 little balls instead of 2 loaves and add some rice flour (maybe 1/4 cup for a half batch) to keep it from being so chalky in the end. But this is with my very liquid cheese. This recipe would make awesome soft bread sticks to use at your next get together because they hold up to dipping and are really quite delicious. And they whip up in no time. Can't go wrong here. Thank you for the recipe.",
