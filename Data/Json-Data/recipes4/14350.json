I also added Paula Deen's House Seasoning to the beans when I added the olive oil. Wasn't sure how the olive oil would taste but it turned out great. I usually make my beans on the stove top and add vegetable oil. I also cooked the beans on high the whole time which gave me more of a \"pot liquor\" which I love to sop up with my corn bread. I will surely be making these again.:)",

I set the slow cooker on Low for 8 hours. Came home, made a dozen gluten free cornbread muffins and had the BEST home cooked meal I've eaten in a long time!!! I already gave this recipe to my Mother and Grandmother to make too! This recipe is hands down the BEST ever and this will be my signature dish from now on! Thank you for this recipe!!!!!",
