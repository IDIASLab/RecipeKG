I substituted chicken stock for the water (vegetable stock would work just as well if you want to keep it vegetarian)added a good sized grind of fresh pepper (I use the peppercorn mix of black red pink and white) a generous clove of fresh garlic a pinch of thyme sea salt instead of table salt for seasoning and it was nearly perfect. Since my husband and I are not vegetarians I added a tablespoon of chopped bacon to add a little rich smoky flavor and it was great. A scant 1/4 tsp of liquid smoke would work for vegetarians. Soups are all about layers of flavors to me and while this recipe was a good base it needed some help to get to where I wanted it to be. P.S. this is my first experiment with quinoa and I will definitely be using it again!",

Also added 3 tbsp minced garlic half way though the onion's cook time so it didnt burn.I also used 3 regular-sized cans cannelloni beans instead of using soaked beans. I added 1 cup chopped kale (to make it healthier) when adding the wine. And of course the inspiration for this.... Instead of water salt-free homemade chicken stock.
