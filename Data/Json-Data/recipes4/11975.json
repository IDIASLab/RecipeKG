The Southern Turkish way of cooking this is before taking it off the stove mix the juice of 1 lemon 2 crushed cloves of garlic and dried mint and pour over the stuffed dolma's(lift the plate off ofcourse) and gently simmer for about 2 more minutes. Dolma can also be prepared using the same ingredients but with cabbage leaves or hollowed out marrow. My favourite is the stuffed very small capsicums usually found in Turkish or Middle Eastern grocery stores. I hope you enjoy this recipe as my family always does. TIP: Turkish people also serve this meal with garlick yoghurt (Mix a little crushed garlick with plain yoghurt).",

It can be really time consuming to prepare the dolma rolls if this is your first few times. In Turkey people use a very simple 2 tool that can roll it perfectly in just a few seconds. Dolma can also be prepared using the same ingredients but with cabbage leaves. Or you can stuff tomatoes or baby-capsicums and oven bake them in the sauce (make sure they don't dry). If you like to try different tastes you can add baby sultanas or blackpepper seeds into the mixture. You can give it a try.",

Use mutton instead it's a very delicious meal on the table of every family in Azerbaijan. Don't bother with tomatoes and tomatoe sauce. This is the first time I hear of someone using it probably made up. For 1 pound of mutton use 1 cup of rice only. Otherwise it will kill the teaste of meat. When everything is ready to be placed on the bottom of the dish you cooking in place a plate on top and press it down. Then pour 3 cups of water. By the time it starts to simmer remove the plate but carefully as it's hot. If you can find fresh grape leaves that's even better. Boil them in water and use as described. Canned is fine too but the taste is not as good once cooked.",

I think the amount of rice used was too much too. As far as rolling the grape leaf place the cut stem end toward you and the tip away from you. Roll away from you first then fold the sides in and finally finish up the dolma by rolling away from you. The tip will rest like a croissant tip: wrapped over and close. Also remember that you need to make room for rice expansion. I suggest starting out the roll with a chopstick. When you are ready to fold the sides in take the chopstick out or whatever you use out and then finish up the roll. I think by decreasing the amount of rice the taste will be less diluted. It was pretty bland.",

I also used instant rice so maybe that was a factor. Well whatever I did they looked right they were just dry as the desert. The dolma i've had from restaurants are oily or vinegary and very moist. Also when it says to put a Tablespoon of filling in each leaf make sure you don't overfill. The fatter ones were even drier! Skinny is better (like a cigar). Maybe I could had covered all the dolmas with liquid? Use lemon juice as the liquid to make them more tart? They definitely needed tzatziki sauce to dip them in but I didn't have any so I used ranch dressing (don't shoot me!). Good luck.",
