This resulted in the right consistency. I will try tempura batter mix next time for more crispness. I made a batch of the dipping sauce for each pancake. Didn t find Korean red pepper powder so substituted cayenne. It was the perfect heat and spice for the pancake. I think you could make this with meat rather than seafood. We added bean sprouts and matchsticks of red bell pepper.",
