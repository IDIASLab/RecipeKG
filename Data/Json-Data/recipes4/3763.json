I made my own chicken stock using a leftover grilled chicken thigh and Better Than Boullion base lending a slight smokey flavor to the soup broth. I also added one grated carrot for added flavor and color along with the frozen wontons. Trader Joe's frozen wontons are our favorite and cooked two minutes is perfect. I upped the Chinese five-spice to 1 tsp and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper personal preference only. Thank you DeviousMuse for a winning recipe!",
