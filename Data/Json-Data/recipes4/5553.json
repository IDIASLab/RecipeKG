I made it the night before and let it sit so by the next day, it was totally ready to go!  The basil added a fresh touch that I really liked, also.

I really love the mayo type potato salads- but wanted a change-and had a party of people with sophisticated palates, Plus I had an abundance of  fresh basil and chives in my garden.  Here are some tips  for a perfect outcome.  You really have to watch the cooking time. If the potatoes over cook, they will break down to mush, like mashed potatoes, so depending on how large your cubes are, they need to come out as soon as its soft enough to eat.  They need to have plenty of firmness to withstand the mixing. My cubes were approx. an inch in diameter and they were done in 10 minutes.  After they cool down to the point where they aren't profusely steaming, you need to coat them with the wet dressing, this will help stop the sticky characteristics that potatoes get as they cool.  I would also wait to add the blue cheese until serving.  Cheese can start to get runny if mixed in.  There are similar recipes on this site that add celery and pickle, and I think that would ruin this elegant and tasty dish that has such great flavors and sophistication  without being too complicated.",

                "reviewBody": "We all liked this. I cooked the potatoes in the microwave stirring a couple of times rather than boiling (about 9 min in mine). I used dried chives because I didn't have fresh and used regular reds chopped to approximate quartered new potatoes but otherwise made no changes. Served at room temp as suggested and the only change I would make is to try lessening the oil a tad next time but that may not work. They weren't too oily I just tend to reduce the amount we use as much as possible. We rarely use mayo so it's nice to have another variation on one of our favorites. This is a very bold flavor though so I don't know that it is as versatile as some salads. I think it would be a nice compliment to a simple grilled steak.",

I actually made this twice, but the first time I way overcooked my potatoes and they became almost like mashed potatoes and absorbed all the dressing, but the taste was still good. I made it again, properly, and I still liked it! The first time I didn't have any onions, so I added onion powder to dressing. This time I did have onion, so I used it but I think I would prefer it without pieces of onion. I don't know that this would be a good choice to make for a crowd; it's a lot of strong flavours that certainly wouldn't be for everyone. I found my first couple of bites of it very strong, but then it grew on me. I'll definitely make it again myself, I like all the strong flavours! Thanks Maridele for posting your recipe.",

I truly dislike potato salads made with mayonnaise, so I decided to try this one. It was unbelievably delicious! I made a few changes. Rather than boil the potatoes, I quartered, oiled (olive oil) and roasted them in a preheated oven for 30 minutes at 400\u00b0. I removed them from the oven before they got mushy and let them cool down before proceeding. I substituted a little red wine vinegar for some of the balsamic since I have a VERY thick, syrupy balsamic that tends to be very sweet. I used Trader Joe's Aioli garlic mustard. I wanted a salad with a bit more crunch, so I increased the amounts of the red onion,  and I also added half of a large red bell pepper, chopped. I added 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley to the basil and chives\u2026and I doubled the amount of basil in the recipe. Finally, I substituted Trader Joe's crumbled goat cheese for the blue cheese. Wonderful blend of sweetness from the balsamic,  heat from the black pepper & mustard, crunch from the red onion and bell pepper, and tang from the goat cheese. I'm going to make this for the Fourth of July!",
