I found this recipe but couldn't go to the store to get the missing ingredients so.... I \"made do\". No sherry. No problem; I added a tablespoon of brown sugar to merlot. No green onion so I substituted a yellow onion finely chopped. I used powdered ginger. I did not add additional salt per other reviews. Another reviewer mentioned wrapping everything in foil and baking for 30 minutes. BINGO - just what I was looking for. I put the very thick steaks into my large stainless steel frying pan poured the sauce over and baked at 350 for about 40 minutes. OH MY GOSH. It was some of the best fish any of us have ever had. I'm keeping the weirdly altered recipe because hubby says \"Don't change a THING.\"",
