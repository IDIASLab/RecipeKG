Used Australian Shiraz instead of Merlot-it's what was available for a similar outcome. I chopped up a couple onions to layer on the bottom of the slow cooker before the beef went in. I also added carrots and celery.  There is ample gravy beginnings with this recipe, so it will pair well with mashed potatoes so you can slather it all over everything and not run out. \n\nThis kind of recipe is very forgiving, so don't be afraid to experiment and change things as you need to.",

I used the ingredients and quantities as listed EXCEPT I omitted the salt. I read a review that said she cut the Montreal seasoning in half because it was too salty; I chose to leave the Montreal alone and eliminate the salt. I had jug Burgundy, so I used it. I sprayed the roast before applying the rub mixture and browned it really well in a sprayed pan on my gas grill (to avoid a mess in the kitchen). When I transferred the meat to the cooker, I added the liquids to the pan I'd used on the grill and scraped up all of the seasonings so as not to leave all of that flavor behind. It is wonderful and I've reduced the liquid in a pot, added mushrooms and served it over mashed potatoes!!",

I cut up potatoes carrots onions and celery and added those to the crock pot. I place the meat into the crock pot adding the au jus and onion mix. I poured Cabernet sauvignon over the top of the roast. I also used one can of beef consume. One cup of water. Cooked on high for 4 hrs. Made a quick roux in a saucepan and added broth from the crockpot until I got the thickness of gravy I desired.",
