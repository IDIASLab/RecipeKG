I ve pickled eggs beets green tomatoes okra etc. I ve made this recipe twice and there is no way two 14 ounce packages will fit in a quart jar let alone with onion and banana peppers. The 1st time I followed it exactly and I thought it had way to much spice and the Little Smokies shouldn t be boiled they are a fully cooked product. The second time I didn t boil them and I cut all spices in added 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 6 whole garlic cloves left out the pepper rings. This time they are edible but get a little better now that they have set for a week. I will keep trying to get the recipe I want but this is not it too many flavors going on and non of it is the sausage. Sorry to poster and thanks for sharing this recipe.",

I did like the pickling mix and will hold on to that for other recipes thanks.",
