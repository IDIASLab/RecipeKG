We were all pleasantly surprised. I had 16 chicken legs and two crockpots so I put half in each. I did one recipe exactly as listed. Very very very yummy!!! The other I used one of the variations from the reviews and instead of the hot sauce, I used some chicken broth. I also added sliced onions and two cans of mushrooms because my kids don't like spicy foods. This also turned out wonderful! I served both varieties with cooked rice. I poured the juices over the rice. We loved it. This is my favorite recipe from this site. I'll use it again and again. Thanks!!",

I'm not a big fan of dark meat but a friend bought a huge package of chicken legs and I needed a good recipe so I made these for Christmas dinner to accompany the main dish.  I must admit I changed it a little only because I wanted crispier texture but juicy so I rubbed the legs in olive oil, seasoned, and let them marinate in refridgerator overnite. I used a package of 13 legs so I had to adjust seasoning to the amount of chicken.  I baked them on 350 for almost an hour without foil.  Placing butter pieces on each leg during this hour.  I took them out the oven and covered well with the hot sauce.  I baked them at least another half hour.  I served them with Bob's blue cheese dressing also from this site with fresh cut celery.  My family loved it!  Thank you.  Note: I used seasoning salt instead of iodized, or kosher and fresh black pepper.  Did not measure, just covered well. None of the other ingrediants were changed.  Be careful with your seasoning salt because the hot sauce with provide additional salt.  Thanks again, it was definitely a hit!",

I almost was just going to cook them in the oven instead of the crock pot, but went ahead and put 12 legs with the skin on in my large crock-pot after rubbing them with pepper, cayenne, paprika, onion and garlic powder mixed with some light butter spread. They pretty much fit on the bottom, and I used Franks hot sauce because that is \"OUR\" hot sauce. I just covered the top of the chicken. Only cooked on high for 2.5 hours and then removed and cooked them in the oven at 400 for thirty minutes, then put them back in the juice in the crock until we were ready to eat them, leaving it on warm. They were actually very good. I do think the crock pot is needed to lock in the juice, and the oven to seal the deal. I made the Absolutely Best Rich and Creamy Blue Cheese dressing on AR for dipping.",

I removed all the skin from the chicken - it was very moist and the flavor was awesome. I did place in 400 oven for 30 minutes after the Crockpot. I served it with hot cooked buckwheat and we spooned the excess sauce over the chicken and the grain -- rice or any other grain would work just as well.
