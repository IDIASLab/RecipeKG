We added more of the same spices that are in the croquette to the breading because it was too bland. Also we made about 30 much smaller balls to ensure they would cook through. Lastly we fried them because they were just no turning brown and crispy on the outside. Will definitely make these again. Yum!",

(I remember my great grandmother making these that way) and also seasoned the rue.  I did double the recipe and froze 1/2 of the croquettes.   Next time I will quadruple the recipe.  It is a wonderful version (almost like my great grandmothers) and very creamy.  Served with fresh turkey gravy and mashed potatoes just like grandma with seasoned green beans.

I followed the amounts but used corn starch instead of flour, and 4-C gluten free bread crumbs to make this more gluten free.   I froze instead of refrigerated the croquettes before coating them and just baked them for 40 minutes, so I can see this also being a make-ahead dish for me. This was a very successful recipe for me to make and I\u2019ll definitely make again.! Thank you for\nPosting!",
