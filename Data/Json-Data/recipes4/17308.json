                "reviewBody": "My family really liked this dish but there are some issues with the recipe. This recipe will serve 4 very hungry individuals but I would say that it's more appropriate for six. I topped it with Greek yogurt diluted with fresh lime juice as recommend. First off the mango salsa is fantastic. It's perfect the way it is. I found the ground beef mixture to be just a little bland so I added a 1/4 teaspoon of salt to draw out the flavors. I also found it odd that the seasonings were put in with the beef as it browned and the the fat was drained taking many of the seasonings with them. I think I would prefer to brown drain add in seasonings and 1/2 cup of water then cook down until the water is gone. The seasonings would be equally distributed and not weakened. Then there was the rice and bean mix. This is where the major problem was with this recipe for me. First off with 2 cups of uncooked rice 2 cans and beans and the other ingredients that is enough to serve 6 people alone with no other food. Add it into a soft shell and this amount of rice would feed 12. The second thing was that there was too much liquid with the rice and it couldn't be cooked out without making the rice mushy. Plus I think the beans add moisture as well. Usually rice is cooked 2 parts water to 1 part rice and in this recipe it was 2 1/4 parts water plus the moisture from the beans and pepper to 1 part rice. I think a more appropriate ratio would have been 1 3/4",
