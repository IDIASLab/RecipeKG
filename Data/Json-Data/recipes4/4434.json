I like to make a new recipe exactly as it's written to give an accurate review but I did use fat free sour cream and light mayo (I'm trying to drop a few pounds) and it was so creamy you wouldn't have guessed it was healthy. There was just the right amount of wet ingredients so it wasn't dry and there were so many textures with the olives and corn and beans! My taste test turned into a bowl of it before the BBQ and everyone raved about it. I am making this again next week for another BBQ and I will try not to eat it all before hand! Thanks so much for the recipe!",

As people tasted it you could see the look of surprise on their faces... no one expected a pasta salad with zip and a lot of people went back for seconds. The medium salsa was perfect for most tastes I don't think I would use a hot salsa. Wish I had doubled the recipe because I love this salad and would have liked to have leftovers for myself and to send home with others... lol Several people asked for the recipe; always a good feeling when you're cooking for others.",

The salad is somewhat soupy at first; when I submitted this recipe I believe I stated \"best when made a day ahead to allow flavors to blend). The macaroni will absorb some of the dressing and will no longer be soupy. When I create a recipe I try to take into consideration who will be eating the food. This recipe as written is intended for the majority of people with average tolerance for spicy/seasoned food. Not everyone can tolerate highly spiced/seasoned food; for those who can they can easily add additional spices and seasonings to suit their taste. I always encourage others to add or omit ingredients to a recipe to suit their individual tastes. Get creative that s what makes cooking fun!:-) UPDATE: I just realized I listed the wrong sized can of sliced Black Olives... it should be a 4.25 oz can not the 6oz can. I notified Allrecipes about the error and they have corrected the recipe sorry for the error.",
