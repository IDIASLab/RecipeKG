I made the base recipe following the original instructions, except I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt, pepper and paprika.  I sliced up a white onion, (not chopped) placed half the onion slices in the bottom of the crockpot, placed the chicken on top, then put the rest of the onions on top of the chicken.  I mixed low fat crm of mush. soup & crm of chicken soup in a bowl, added a little milk until it was smooth, and then mixed in a can of diced tomatos & a can of sliced mushrooms.   I poured that over the chicken and onions, and sprinkled garlic salt, pepper and paprika on the top of everything.  Since it was just for me and my husband, I only use 3 pieces of boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I turned the crockpot on high, it only took 2 1/2 to cook.  I served over egg noodles.  \n\nI'm not kidding.  This is one of the BEST dinners I have ever made!  The sauce was excellent and the chicken was really really moist and tender.  My husband basically licked his plate, and as I'm writing this review, he's over there eating another helping!",

I threw in frozen chicken breasts, a sliced onion in the beginning, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and some minced garlic.

I preseasoned the chicken with pepper, season salt and garlic (mixed the seasonings together and rubbed on the chicken)Then I added sliced fresh mushrooms (about 1/2 lb?) and sprinkled a bit more garlic on them.  Then I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the celery and mixed it with the cream of chicken.  I poured the soup mixture on top and them mixed a bit (next tim I'll probably just add mushrooms and garlic to the soup mixture and pour over the chicken).  Then near the end of cooking I added the sour cream.  I served some of the gravy mixture over mashed potatoes and a side of green beans (added some color other than browns).  The chicken was REALLY tender and all the breasts but 1 fell apart when I stired in the sour cream.  Next time I'll cook a bit less and I may use 6 breasts instead of 4.  There was A LOT of gravy left over.\r\nThanks for posting the recipe.:-)",

I really appreciated another reviewer mentioning that he/she put this recipe on high for 6 hours because I didn't have as much time as the recipe called for. Mine ended up being done by 5.5 hours on high so this is good to know for the future. I substituted the cream of celery for cream of broccoli which was delicious and cut up some fresh mushrooms. Anticipating the extra gravy (which wasn't really all that much)I made some buttermilk biscuits roasted potatoes and plain steamed veggies all great for dipping. Will make again 0 thanks!!",
