I found this recipe and went to the market and got a jar of cactus. I sauted some onions and added my beans. The cactus is vinegary and spicy. I mentioned to Carlos that they don't have a lot of flavor and he said \"No they don't. That is the way they are!\" I added 1/2 the jar and heated it up. Really good! The cactus by itself, tastes like pickled green  beans. I will of course make this again. Thank You Katz002.",
