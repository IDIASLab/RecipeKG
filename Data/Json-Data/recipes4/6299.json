Tried it again on another weekend, adding only 1/2 cup milk after the evaporated milk, which was just right.  Also, added the butter before adding the flour.  As written, however, we found it too thin and milky, tasting more like that from a restaurant trying to cut corners and stretch the sausage for more servings.",

So simple.....I've used all types of sausage....prefer Bob Evan's tube sausage but in a pinch I have used precooked sausage patties and chopped them up finely.  I have even made triple batches and put them in a plastic container for my husband to take to deer camp......they all RAVED about it.  For those that feel this is too thin....be sure to let in simmer down to the consistency they like.  No need to add additional flour.  Thank you for the AWESOME recipe.
