Also, like another poster, I added a bit of garlic powder and some basil to the recipe, and, since our family likes a good bit of heat with our food, I also added about 2tsp red pepper flakes.  I submitted a couple of pictures of the result, and, as you can see, mine turned out more like a chili than a soup.  That's not a bad thing, of course, but I was expecting something a little thinner than I got.\n\nIF I were to make this again, I think I would only use a single can of corn, probably the creamed corn, and then use vegetable broth to make up the rest of the liquid.\n\nOne last note:  it's ridiculously filling.  I took a great big bowl because I was Starving, but by the time I was half way done, I felt a little sick.  Just, you know, FYI.  :)",
