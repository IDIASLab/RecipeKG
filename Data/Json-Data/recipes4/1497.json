I would have given this 5 stars but I added additional spices to the mayo mixtures....thyme, rosemary, oregano, and dried parsley for color.  It was so moist, so tender, and so fast!  I made mine on top of a wire rack on a cookie sheet, and then flipped them for the last 5 minutes so that it would be crispy all the way around.  Delicious!  I can't wait to try it with Kraft Dijonaise instead of mayo for a little less fat and more flavor.\n*edit*\nI think it's a MUST to cook this on a wire rack and flip at the end....we didn't do this the second time I made it and it was a soggy mess on the bottom.",

It made it that much more crunchier! Use chicken tenderloins, that way the chicken crunches up better. I also cooked it on a pampered chef stone!

I usually go an egg wash, but I thought I'd give the mayo a try just for old times sake and to see what my husband thought.  I added more seasoning to my bread crumbs (parsley, oregano, basil, rosemary) and used Hellman's light mayo and light Parmesan cheese.  I sprayed the bottom of the baking dish with Pam so nothing would stick and these came out moist and delicious - perfect with a side of twice baked potates and a salad.",

I almost didn't try this b/c I hate the taste of mayo and parm cheese but since others said you couldn't taste them I decided to give it a try. They were right... I didn't taste either one of them at all! I used this to make chicken parmesam (sp?) and my husband LOVED this! My only suggestion is if you have really thick breasts to either cut them in half or pound them down. I think this would of been even better/crisper if the chicken was thinner. My breasts must of been on Steriods b/c they were HUGE! LOL  I did use the suggestion to cook it on a cookie rack (on a covered cookie sheet)and I turned each breast 5 mins before they were done to crisp the bottem as well and that worked good... I'll probably do that every time now. And now I'll probably try the other suggestions for adding different spices and maybe using real garlic since I always have fresh garlic on hand. Thanks for the recipe.. This was so much better than using store bought breaded chicken patties! ",

I just wiggled the chicken, both sides, in the mayo mixture, then into the bread crumbs.

So did using freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and seasoning the chicken well with salt and freshly ground pepper.  The seasoning I used has a fair amount of \"green stuff\" in it, otherwise I would have added fresh chopped parsley to the mix.  The chicken looked a little dry going in, so I spritzed it with olive oil and I think that made a huge difference in getting the coating crispy and golden.  This turned out tender, juicy and with the crisp coating I had hoped for.  Just delicious. Another of those \"big pay-off for little effort\" type of recipes.",
