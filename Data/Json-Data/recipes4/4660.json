As the recipe is stated I used exactly 3 ea 12 oz packages of the wrappers. So plan accordingly. I had to make an extra trip to the store mid-way though. They are still excellant and I will continue to make them. Back to the store tomorrow for more wrappers as tomorrow will be making them with spinach. I take a few days a month for cooking for freezer storage so I can be a lazy cook when I want too.",
