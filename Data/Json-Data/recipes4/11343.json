The lentils are soft while the vegetables (and apples) remain slightly crisp.  The stew is a little spicy, a little sweet, and very filling; a perfect meal for the cold winter nights.  I am very pleased with this recipe and it will definitely become a regular meal in my home.  This is the best recipe I have found on allrecipes.com, I would rate it a 10 if possible!",

I added chopped celery doubled the garlic used chicken stock instead of water and substituted a 14.5 oz can of petite diced tomatoes for fresh ones. Put in all of you vegetable at the beginning if you want them soft which I do. The addition of cumin powder chili powder and a few dashes of hot sauce makes this stew just right. Pur\u00e9e half of the soup for a rich consistency. Reserve the peas to add during the last couple minutes of cooking. I wouldn't pur\u00e9e the peas. This healthy satisfying soup is a keeper.

As another reviewer has mentioned the carrots don't go completely soft but I like crunchy vegetables so this is a plus for me. I didn't have any bbq sauce on hand but I was determined to make this so I threw together a sauce from ketchup vinegar sugar Worchester sauce and smoke granules. It didn't taste exactly like bbq sauce but I'm loving the flavour of the stew so much that I would consider using this home-made concoction again when I make this meal next time. There will definitely be a next time. Thanks.",
