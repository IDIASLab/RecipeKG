I did make some minor changes: marinated in a bag used garlic powder (figured there was enough salt in the sauces) finely minced a bit of onion (no onion powder) and omitted the thyme. I look forward to trying it as written - except I stand by the garlic powder decision! Thanks for a great recipe!",

I use Worcestershire often when using lamb or beef, but I thought it was terrible on fish.  2 Tablespoons of pepper was too much, and I am a pepper lover.  In my opinion, this is a very poorly conceived marinade, and anyone who cooks fish regularly should be able to do much better.  Try salt, a little pepper, lemon, and some tamer spices like a little dill.  If you want to go Asian, soy sauce, ginger, orange juice, some sugar, and there you go.",

Doubled the soy & worcestershire sauces 3 Tbs. garlic salt 3 Tbs. chili powder 3 tbs. black pepper minced onion didn't have onion powder and omited the thyme. Turned into a \" marinade\" instead of a \"rub\". Results were exelent! Let marinate for 2 hours in a freezer bag in the frig and baked as per recipe. Thank-you for sharing a great recipe!!!!!

I soaked the shark steaks in milk for a couple of hours beforehand to reduce the \"fishy\" smell (after coming across this tip online). I rinsed the steaks and patted them dry. I made the rub as directed using dried thyme instead of the fresh. I grilled the steaks for about 15 minutes on non stick foil over medium heat. The thicker steaks failed to cook all the way through so unfortunately they had to be nuked. They turned out pretty well. As mentioned in a previous review we did have to \"scrape\" some of the spices off. Good flavor though. I will definitely try this rub on other types of meat but I don't know that I will be doing it again with shark.",
