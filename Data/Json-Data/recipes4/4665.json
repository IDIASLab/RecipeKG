The guests left one or two but I had them when I came out of the kitchen so no leftovers always a good sign. It is very easy to make. I used 1/2 slides of bacon so there was less bacon per piece. I also found that baking took longer than anticipated. The moisture in the oysters slowed the cook time so I had to keep them in for quite a bit longer but they came out fine. NOTE: that means you could make a little ahead and keep them warm pretty easily. Plan on using the larger round toothpicks. The small ones made it difficult to put it all together. They were not the top choice hit of the party but they were popular. I definitely will make them again.",

A big success- they were gone as soon as the picture was taken. I cooked the bacon on a griddle first until it was a bit cooked but still pliable (I was afraid the oysters would be over done or the bacon would be raw without precooking it a bit). Also I did not measure out the spices I just sprinkled on what I thought was a good amount. Some of the bigger oysters took longer to cook than the smaller ones so they had to be put back in the oven for a couple more minutes. Overall everyone was happy and gave it two thumbs up!",
