Also rather than use prociutto pancetta an Italian bacon delivers even better results. Personally I feel that dried out store bought bread crumbs are tasteless. Just pop a couple of slices of italian bread with seasonings including parmesean cheese in a food processor and you have a much much better result. Also commercial spaghetti sauce unless of good quality tends to be salty and pungent. Make your own...",

I tell ya it's a great feeling when you slave for two hours over a meal that you've never heard of in your life and your man loves it so much that he states he \"might just cry\" when it's all gone. It didn't take two hours for me to cook but it could be because I bought really thin beef rounds. It took me about a half hour or so to prepare then an hour and a half to cook in the pan. Whatever you do don't forget to find something anything to keep the meat rolled. I spaced on kitchen twine at the market and didn't have any toothpicks around... I ended up extracting the metal from twistie ties and using those. Very good meal! Give it a try.",

I added some pine nuts (just because I had them around with no other use in sight) along with the breadcrumbs prociutto and egg and simmered the roasts (I made 2 smaller roasts) in homemade sauce along with pork ribs while I did some housework. A couple hours later I prepared a salad and cooked some ziti and dinner was served. Boyfriend loved it and so did I. I've made rolled stuffed roasts before but they've turned out pretty bland - this was great really flavorful. Thanks DeeJay!",

Even the lowest stove setting was too much for the sauce and ruined it causing the sauce to become too strong and drowned out the flavor of the roast. I think I'll try cooking it 1 more time in a bit of broth instead and add the spaghetti sauce later. I also think this would work better in a crockpot after browning the meat rather than doing all the cooking on the stove.",
