I skipped the cabbage & onion ingredients and substituted about one cup of leftover cabbage carrots and onions from St. Patrick's day corned beef and cabbage. Drained the vegetables well ran a knife through them for a rough chop and then folded them into the batter. Check seasoning based on the saltiness of the cooked vegetables. These cooked up very light and fluffy. This was a great way to use up a small amount of leftover veggies. The batter was VERY easy to make and turned out lighter than boxed mixes.
