I have to agree with the other reviewers--the vodka taste is too strong and it needs more olives. I did used pimento stuffed olives and I added in a quarter cup of chopped jalapenos. Even after sitting, the vodka taste did mellow but it was still way too strong. I'd like to play with this recipe. I think it's close, but it's missing a little somethin'-somethin' or two. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
