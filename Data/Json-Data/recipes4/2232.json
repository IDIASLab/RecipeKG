Be sure to remove the jalapeno addition if you have kids to feed as it will make it to spicy for them. I did not use green salsa, I used green enchilada sauce (La palma), added two shredded, dried New Mexico chiles, 3 cloves of garlic, a can of roasted green chiles, 1/2 TB salt, 1/2  TB cumin, then I added 2 TB  cornstarch during the last 30 minutes to thicken the sauce. Be sure to dissolve the cornstarch in cold water, then add to the hot chile verde. If you follow these additions, you'll have authentic chile verde from a slow cooker!",

Chili Verde is meant to be more than seasoned meat, so expect a *liquidy* product - the sauce is flavorful and has great heat, perfect on rice. The one thing I altered was the slow cooker setting - I just went for 6 hours on low, and the meat was perfectly cooked and tender, I'll be making this again and again - thanks so much for sharing :)",

But I don't always have time for that, and often need to put a quick, healthy dinner together that the whole family will eat.  So I'm grateful when other folks put recipes on here with some shortcuts that make my life easier.  \n\nNow the review part... this is a delicious, easy recipe.  It's good over rice, on breakfast tacos, burritos, or with quesadillas.  I left out the jalepenos because I have young children.  The green salsa still gave the chile plenty of heat.  I added 1 tsp. of cumin, 1/4 tsp. of white pepper, and 2 TBSP. of lime juice (I use those in my from scratch recipe).  This recipe works well with chicken if you don't have pork on hand (and, yes, I know the chicken isn't \"AUTHENTIC.\" chile verde).  Happy cooking!",
