The cinnamon is just too overpowering for a hot lemon drink and it made the fresh lemon juice I used taste like some concentrate.",

I had no zest so I omitted it and put in extra lemongrass to compensate. Then I ran out of lemon juice halfway through and had to use lime juice instead. I still think it tastes mostly the way it was meant to - not like lemonade but some of the best home brewed tea with a very zesty lemony flavor. Hot or cold it was perfect",

The one thing I would do without is the lemon grass because it tends to float and you end up getting some in your mouth as you drink.  It's not good tasting with the drink.  It needs to go.  Other than that it was very flavorful and refreshing.  Another observation is that the ingredients tend to separate.",
