I doubled the garlic and added 2 oz cream cheese because I knew I wanted mine to be very cheesy and one review mentioned they were dry. When I filled the mushrooms I brushed a bit of melted butter over the mix before I sprinkled on the final Parmesan. I actually had a little filling leftover so I'm stuffing a couple portobellas for dinner tonight that I will serve with pasta and red sauce like a \"stuffed portobello parmesan\" The whole tray of these mushrooms disappeared in no time at the potluck. You'll be so glad you made these.",

I've never mixed an egg in mushroom stuffing before and I was skeptical but they are good! I didn't sprinkle the additional cheese over the top - seemed like overkill to me.
