We used a Reynold's oven bag big enough for a turkey and learned a lot from our first experience. 1. Heat up the measured water pour in the salt to dilute it then fridge the water to cool it off. 2. Place the bag in the cooler add the ingredients then the turkey. THE BAGS ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND A TRANSFER TRUST ME! (We just got done cleaning up apple juice garlic brine from our floor and surrounding cabinets! 3. And do NOT follow the advice of the person who suggested a garbage bag. As someone else pointed out it's not food grade. Good luck and happy Thanksgiving!",

However for the amount of work I put into this brining thing (which was new to me) my turkey was no different than what I would normally make. My guests thought the same. I usually roast my turkey in my Nesco roaster oven. I put melted butter on top and season with just salt and pepper. I roast it breast side down and wait until it \"caves in\". Then I know that it is falling apart and done well. This is not good though if you want the picture perfect turkey to put on the table and carve. I do my \"carving\" ahead of time and put the platter of meat on the table.",

About 2 cups or more of the brine will end up in the bowl. Then rinse the turkey again and pat dry! Most recipes miss this key step. Also don't use salted butter or chicken broth on your turkey or it will end up being salty.",
