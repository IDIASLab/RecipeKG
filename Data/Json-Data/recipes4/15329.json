That's easily fixed, I will use less honey next time or half honey and corn syrup. If you're looking for a thick syrup- this isn't.  I added a cornstarch slurry. The ratio is 1 teas cornstarch to 1 Tb. cold water per cup of berry liquid; add to hot mixture and cook a bit. I also added 1 to 2 tb. fresh lemon juice, thought it gave another flavor element. I enjoyed some of the syrup in my lemonade, sort of took on a gourmet flavor and a beautiful color. Really liked the optional spices when added.",

I also added the full amount of raw honey to the warm elderberry syrup. I bought a few pounds of dried elderberries on Amazon that weren't too expensive so I could make this recipe. I tripled the recipe and simmered it for an hour and a half. Then I water bath canned it for 20 minutes so I can preserve it and give away as needed during the cold and flu season. A triple batch made 2 quarts and 6 pints. I take a Tablespoon daily as a preventative to colds and flu. Or, you can take a Tablespoon every 2-3 hours at the first sign of illness. It's delicious and amazingly effective for illness! And its WAY cheaper to make your own than to buy it- I have looked and seen that a half pint goes for about 4 dollars! AND you know what's in your own :) Thanks for sharing this recipe- it's definitely a keeper!",

I tripled the recipe (3 cups berries to 9 cups water) and only added about 3/4 cup of honey in the end. The result was perfect. Just a tad sweet and a nice compliment to the cinnamon/clove/ginger flavor. Also I didn't have cinnamon sticks or whole cloves so I added ground cinnamon and the same with the cloves being sure not to go too heavy on them. I did have fresh ginger. This turned out to be more juice than syrup but I suppose you could boil it for much longer to get more of a syrup consistency.",
