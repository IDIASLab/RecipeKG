This dish comes out as more like a stew than a meat with a sauce. Serve over egg noodles or hot cooked rice. Goes great with fresh, crusty pumpernickel bread for hearty winter meal. Easy to make and can be kept on low heat on the stove for lengthy parties.",

I did lighten it up a bit as we are trying to eat healthier...I used whole wheat flour in place of regular for dredging sprayed my pan w/ olive oil cooking spray instead of using oil and reduced the amount of sour cream by more than 1/2 and used light sour cream. This still provided the richness/creaminess w/o all the extra fat/calories. I served this over Ronzoni Smart Taste egg noodles (this was our first time trying them and they were FANTASTIC BTW!). This was super simple to make and a definite keeper YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
