I did happen to leave out the ketchup by mistake and I'm not sure if that was the reason I found the burgers to be a bit bland. As another reviewer mentioned I thought the rosemary flavor was a bit strong (and I love rosemary!) so next time I think I'll use a combination of rosemary thyme and some rubbed sage. Still the cranberries and cheese (whichever kind you end up using) make fabulous additions to a turkey burger.",

I used 3/4 cup of bread crumbs instead of bread. 1/2 cup of dried cranberries that were soaked in hot water. 2 tbsp of mustard instead of ketchup since no one seemed to like it. Mustard did add extra flavor. We dont like Rosemary so I added 1 teaspoon of honey which was amazing! Also make sure you serve this with a pineapple salsa--it makes all the difference. If you need a quick recipe 1 cup pineapple 1 cup papaya 1 1/2 cup of your favorite tomato salsa. Next time I make this I will brown the onions and increase the cranberries even more.",
