It is actually very similar to gooey butter cake I usually only bake this 35-40 minutes so it maintains some of that gooeiness and sometimes I will add some chocolate or toffee chips if I want a change.

Also I used home-grown eggs and used 2 additional ones overall. Finally I decided to add a layer of chocolate on top so I used 3 ounces of unsweetened baking bars 3 T Powdered sugar and half a can of sweetened condensed milk to make a topping in a double boiler.
