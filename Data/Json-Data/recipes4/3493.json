Well balanced combination of the flavors and I particularly liked the additions of nutmeg and lemon juice which I didn't measure just added to taste probably less than what was called for. The turmeric gives the orzo a brilliant yellow color which in combination with the green kale (I used arugula because I grow it) gave this a striking appearance. (Note to self: this might make a great dish for a Green Bay Packers party with its vivid colors of green and gold!) Other than seasoning to taste rather than adhering strictly to the given measurements I wouldn't change this recipe at all and have absolutely no criticism. It's lovely.",

Not sure why you need the turmeric other than it makes your orzo a pretty color.  This makes a HUGE side dish.  I normally only make half a pound, but I wanted to follow the recipe.  Make sure you stem the Kale- it doesn't get soft and I was glad I did a good job on all but one leaf.  Kale is not bad, but I think the lemon juice and parm is a little on the light side for this much orzo.  I also found my kale starting to burn with no water just the evoo to cook it in and my garlic was clearly on the brown side.  If I did this again I would cook my garlic then add a little water or stock to steam my kale instead of cooking it in the oil.  Some of the pieces got really crispy.  Thanks for sharing overall it was good I would just make a few minor changes next time.",

Drain kale and mix w/veggies and orzo. Fabulous. I used only one cup orzo and it made 4 lunch sized meals.",

I followed some of the suggestions given by others.  I cooked the orzo the way we always cook orzo, cooked the kale the way we always cook kale, then combined them with the turmeric, lemon juice, nutmeg and parmesan cheese as a last step.\n\nWe normally cook orzo by cooking minced garlic in oil for a few seconds until fragrant, then we put the dry orzo in and toast the orzo for a few short minutes.  We also add some chili flakes, which some other suggested as well.  Then we add slightly more chicken broth than orzo and bring to boil then lower the heat and cook covered until the broth is absorbed and the orzo is soft.\n\nAs for the kale, we cook garlic in oil until fragrant, add a half cup broth, then bring to boil.  Once boiling we add the kale and heat until the kale is wilted and the liquid is absorbed.\n\nThe dish was good when I followed those steps and we both enjoyed the combination.  We will make it again.",
