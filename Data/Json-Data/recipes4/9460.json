The ingredients call for 1 1/2 cups water but the directions call for 1 cup water and 1/2 cup pineapple juice. I didn't have the pineapple juice since it wasn't listed in the ingredients I didn't buy it. I tried draining my canned pineapple juice but didn't get anywhere near 1/2 a cup. I called a friend who makes a similar salad. She says hers calls for 3 cups of liquid. This one has 2. I decided to add the 3 just to be safe. Also this recipe asks for the pineapple to be cooked. I decided not too since it was neither fresh nor frozen I figured it wouldn't interfere with the jello setting up. It was a good recipe once I had it figured out but I'm glad I didn't just dive into it or ask one of the kids to do it or it may have not turned out well.",

My Aunt was always in charge of bringing it but when she passed away no one knew how to make it. I have searched and tried many this was the closest. The only thing I do differently is I drain the pineapple first. This is how I get my half cup of pineapple juice. Also after the Jell-O has set a little I whip the Jell-O also it makes it creamier. I blend the cream cheese and pineapple together before adding to the Jell-O and we do not add any nuts. I am so glad I found this recipe. Thank You SHECOOKS2 Also total liquid should be 2 cups so 1 1/2 cups boiling water and 1/2 cup pineapple juice.",

Note that you should drain the canned pineapple to extract the juice...if you don't have enough add water to meet the measurement. For the life of me I couldn't figure out why we needed to cook the pineapple (I did it anyway)...I thought that maybe it helped bring out the sugar? But then I figured it's probably because a long time ago they used fresh pineapple instead of canned...aw well anyone's guess. Loved making my own whipping cream for it. I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 because I love this recipe with pears and pear juice instead of pineapple...it's 100x better!!! Though this one is still very good. Also I mixed in the cream cheese and pineapple w/my mixer into the jello...makes everything more creamy. Thank you!!!",
