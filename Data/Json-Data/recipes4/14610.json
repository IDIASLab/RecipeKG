                "reviewBody": "\"Beginner\" ?? The taste sure isnt! I continue to learn that many of the simplest recipes are the best. The dark meat of the thighs make a difference as they add to the flavour. In addition to dumplings I sometimes prepared egg noodles for those who like it served that way and frequently because the dumplings tend to disappear so fast! A very good \nrecipe!\nMore thoughts:\nTo economise I've bought skin on bone in chicken (big $ difference). Using an oven & stovetop safe pot, the chicken can then be roasted in the oven at 350-375 degrees for approximately 30-40 minutes. Once cooled the skin & bones are easily removed. Any excess fat can be spooned off and the cooked crispy bits in the pot's bottom will add to the favour. At this point carry on as directed, perhaps choosing to omit the butter as the only change.\nHealthorg's recipe is delicious as posted but I'm finding with the price of ready prepped chicken so dear, this can be a savings option by slightly altering only the method.\nCheers!",
