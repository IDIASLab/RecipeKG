Pulled out some smoked sausage and started there.  I didn't have ham hocks, but not to worry.  Sliced the sausage and sauteed with a sweet onion.  Deglazed the pan with white wine as well.  In a crockpot I put 5 chopped turnips, 1 chopped kohlrabi, carrots, and a few garlic scapes sliced thin.  I added a can of black beans and corn and a bouillon cube.  Lastly I added a can of mild chiles and didn't add the cabbage  until about an hour before serving.  My husband said the turnips tasted like potatoes and it was a great soup.  Super easy and used my produce the best way I could find.",
