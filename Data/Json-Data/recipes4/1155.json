This was to keep the cheese from burning. I didn't measure my cheese but I know 1 ounce really isn't that much so I think next time I would add more cheese. I used freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano and most of it melted and then there were only little flecks left to form the \"crust\". Sprinkling the balsamic on last was a great touch. I love the strong flavor of balsamic with vegetables though so you have to know you like that flavor.",

I swear roasting asparagus is not only the easiest but also the best way to cook asparagus. It was the additions to the asparagus in this recipe that didn't appeal to me. First I believe grated Parmesan rather than shaved is a much better option - I didn't want to end up with gloppy wads of cheese on my asparagus - and just a little sprinkling was fine. Second this cried out for some garlic to me - garlic powder would be fine tho' I sprinkled it very lightly with fresh minced. Finally I already knew I wouldn't like the balsamic vinegar on the asparagus because I don't care for it in the first place. But I thought Hubs would like it as he's more a fan of it than I am. To the recipe's credit it does give you the option to add the balsamic vinegar to taste rather than the suggested heavy-handed 1/4 cup but even \"to taste\" Hubs didn't care for it and agreed a squeeze of fresh lemon juice (like I put on mine) would have been a much better choice.",
