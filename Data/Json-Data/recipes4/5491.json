        "description": "My first original recipe. A new approach at spicing up tofu. Easy for anyone, yet looks exotic enough for a dinner date. Has a delicate flavor related to Thai cuisine, yet uses basic ingredients most people have on hand. With this serving size, it will allow each person to get 4 pieces of stuffed tofu. Served with rice, it makes a pleasantly light meal. Serve along side a bed of rice on a plate. Drizzle with teriyaki sauce, being sure to decorate the sides of the plate. The sauce really complements the flavors of the stuffing! You can easily make it more filling by serving seared zucchini on the side and a nice, light wine. Be sure to add your own personal touches!",

I made a couple of adjustments but nothing major like using button mushrooms instead of shiitake (not a fan) and didn't want to get cabbage just for a small amount so I shredded carrots. The carrots gave it some color to the filling. Only advice to give is to make sure to pack the fillings otherwise it will fall apart while frying. I liked dipping it with sweet chili sauce (Mae Ploy).Thank you Kaleas for your creative recipe!",

On another note I had some filling left over so I used it in some leftover eggroll wrappers I had to make some spur-of-the-moment egg rolls. Absolutely amazing!
