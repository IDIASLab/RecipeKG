The only change I made was due to what I had on hand; no hot pepper sauce, so I subbed crushed red pepper flakes and a little of Emeril's Southwest Seasoning.  (The chipotle sour cream was a little tart for me- I think next time I would cut down on the lime juice, or maybe leave it out altogether, but that is just personal preference.)\nThanks mabcat!!  This definitely stays in rotation!  :)\n\np.s. After looking at a few recipes for fish tacos, I made just the corn salsa from 'Fiery Fish Tacos with Crunchy Corn Salsa', also on this site.  It was FANTASTIC with this fish!  You could even make the tilapia fillets with the corn salsa on the side (not as tacos) and that would be a wonderful entree.",

The first time I made this I accidently bought chipotle peppers in adobo sauce rather than just the adobo sauce.  I picked out the peppers and followed the recipe as written and holy cow it was hot! Too hot and I love really spicy food. I ended up adding a lot more sour cream to calm it down.  The 2nd time I made it I used the same sauce but strained out the seeds after picking out the pepper and it was perfect.  NOT kid friendly due to the spice/heat, but will definitely make again & pass on the recipe to others! Thanks!",

The marinade and sauce look very promising here and sound delicious, but I do have to question the need to cut up the fish PRIOR to grilling (I never have and never will)? Leaving it whole makes it MUCH easier for grilling, cuts out a little work and the marinade would still impart good flavor because fish is a meat which absorbs flavors very easily (and 9 minutes seems like a very long time to cook for cutting it into smaller pieces). There really is no need to cut it up prior. Leave it whole, grill it for the same amount of time and flake it into bite size chunks when assembling the tacos. They will be just as delicious and you will cut out a few steps making this an even easier recipe! :)",

                "reviewBody": "Not bad.... I think I liked this more than my hubs did tho (but that's the norm in my house lol!). My hubs and I both LOVE fish tacos. I've tried many grilled and battered (i.e. fried) recipes on here but none have been to our liking. This was by FAR the best of the bunch but is in need of some minor tweaking to better suit our tastes. For one the sauce is WAAAY too spicy (holy socks!) and heavy for such a delicate fish. It would be much better if it were considerably toned down and paired with a meatier fish - maybe halibut or marlin. Now onto the positives.:) The marinade is simply fantastic! I could have eaten the fish on it's own it was that good. The sauce was also good but again it was REALLY spicy. All I could taste was adobo which is a shame because the spices and lime didn't have a chance to shine thru. I recommend HALVING the adobo to start and adjust to your liking from there. NOTE: You need to cut your tilapia into chunks BEFORE grilling (if you don't your filets will flake) but by doing so it makes it nearly impossible to prevent from falling thru the grates of your grill. My husband found a simple solution. Reynolds Wrap sells a product made specifically for grilling. Alternatively you can use a special grill pan if you have one. Topped with shredded coleslaw mix fresh pico and Mexican-blend cheese. Spanish rice and tortilla chips were great no-fuss accompainments. Frozen margaritas helped cool our burning mouths ha!
