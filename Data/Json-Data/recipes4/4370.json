First the combination of seasonings in here superb the sauce is wonderful. The pork (which I used 2lb) is thick enough that it either needs to be brined for a few hours or rubbed with kosher salt the night before. The method in which this is prepared would make a wonderful chicken or beef stew. Don't pass this up and with the exception of the salt don't change anything especially the cooking preparation! I also substituted apricot preserves this time for the fig compote",

Also even though my pork roast was half the size of the recipe I kept all the other measurements the same. It was really fabulous. So good and so easy. I did as one of the reviewers said and coated the roast in kosher salt overnight. I only had a chance to immediately cook the roast after applying the rub. Next time I will let the roast sit with the rub on for an hour or so before preparing. I also think this would be awesome with a turkey breast or turkey tenderloins. I would make this for guests.",

If you were to find an individual Moroccan family who ate pork, they would be the exception, but definitely not representing the culture as a whole. We live in Spain, as my husband's work sends him frequently to Morocco and we have many, many Moroccan friends and acquaintances. Sometimes it's good to use a little bit of discretion as we advertise dishes as being \"ethnic\" or \"authentic\" from a particular country--in order to avoid confusing others at the very least. Still, it looks delicious and would love to try it some time!",
