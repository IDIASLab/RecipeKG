I use chive cream cheese spread, and parmesan cheese from the green can it works just as good if not better than the other.  I think the key to this recipe is the fresh bacon (do not use the pre cooked bacon).  I make this recipe in the morning and fry up the whole package of bacon (my family eats the rest for breakfast with eggs), I use  slightly more bacon 9-10 slices.  Also make sure you cut up the artichoke heart.  Serve with tortilla chips and/or toasted bread slices on the side.  Only serve a little at a time, keep the rest in a warm oven to keep extra yummy and hot!!!  This is the BEST EVER!!!!",

The garlic-herb cheese spread is probably the Aluoette brand that can be found at most grocery stores near the deli dept. with the gourmet cheeses (like Muenster, Gouda, etc.) It is wonderfully flavored and I am guessing it makes the difference in this recipe compared to others.",

I had 8 oz tub of soft chive/onion crm cheese but only a \u00bd cup of sour cream. So I added a couple big spoonfuls of a Chipotle dip on hand. I used a Parm/Romano/Asiago cheese blend. Had a can of quartered Artichoke hearts in water I drained & chopped (I don\u2019t care for the oily marinated kind). I did as another\u2019s review to add the bacon on top before baking - good tip! (I did add a few drops of liquid smoke into dip mixture to compensate). Since I like garlic & didn\u2019t have the garlic/herb cheese spread, I added a tsp of crushed garlic. I chopped up the spinach after removing any large stem pieces. I think some chopped water chestnuts and a bit of chopped grn onion would incorporate well. This is a great base recipe and for anyone like me it\u2019s a great starting point you can experiment with when you don't have exact ingredients. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s super made the way it\u2019s written also! Note: I also froze \u00bd of the recipe as I made this just for myself. Too much for me to eat on my own as it is a bit on the rich side, but real satisfying when you just need to have something hot, cheesy, savory, sinful and delish! Glad I have some available for my next craving!!! Love it with homemade toasted pita triangles.",
