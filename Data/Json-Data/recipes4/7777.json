I cooked the onion longer to caramelize it and reduced the sauce a good bit. Cooking on a hot night with the grill already going for asparagus I tucked the cast iron skillet right on the grate instead of heating the oven and it was fab. Topped it with a delicious double cream feta; served it over pasta. Stunning dinner for three with leftovers.",

I lucked out finding some beautiful huge prawns but I'm thinking any size shrimp would work. The feta had a great texture and flavour blend with the other ingredients. Reading the other reviews and sampling the Ouzo sauce ahead of time I too found it a touch sweet and so I decided to very lightly salt the shrimp prior to cooking it...it turned out perfectly. I'm thinking this would also be awesome over actual saganaki cheese instead of the feta! Thanks for a great recipe Angie:)",
