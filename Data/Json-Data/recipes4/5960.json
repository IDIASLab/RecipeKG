She makes a huge pot of this chowder every Christmas Eve and all of it is gone by Christmas night. Although it is not very healthy, it is an awesome treat once in awhile for any of us that love seafood! I normally throw in a dash of garlic and onion powder. Enjoy!",

I found that you really need to measure the liquids out, as it was too 'liquidy' even after I drained off the water.  The cooking time was a bit too long also.  I love seafood chowder and even though this was good, I've had much better.  Are you sure there's no thickening?  After supper, I did drain off again half the liquid and I'm sure it will be much better now.  I know you saiud your measures are 'approximate' but even so....we had to 'fish' for the seafood in the liquid.  I've also noticed in your picture there is corn, the recipe never called for corn....",
