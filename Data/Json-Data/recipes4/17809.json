                "reviewBody": "It's an OK basic brown(ish) gravy, but has nothing to do with what KFC has for gravy.  If you added some powdered or ground poultry seasoning it might get closer.  As to browning time for flour, you don't brown flour by the clock.  it depends VERY much on the stove setting and size of pan.  Could be 5 minutes or 20 minutes but should turn golden brown (somewhere between egg yolk and biscuit tops - not like a browned piece of meat).  You may not smell a change until it is burnt.\nAs to why this is not even close to KFC recipe?  They start with shortening that was just used to fry the chicken, not butter or oil, and the thickener is a mixture of chicken base and the same flour the chicken is breaded with (so it has all those 11 herbs and spices).   How do I know? - I worked in 3 different KFC's during 70's-80's and now my kids still work in them too.  One of the few things that has not been changed/updated is the gravy.",

Very easy to make and tastes a lot better than packet/packaged gravy. I did halve the recipe, and did not cook the roux for 20 minutes, more like 5-8 minutes. I will def be making this again and again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I made it quicker (I was on a time crunch) by not browning the thick onion/butter/flour paste and it still ended up nice. I didn't have beef bouillon so I added 2 tsp of au jus mix. I also used an emulsifier at the end to make sure it was smooth. Exactly what I needed in a crunch.",
