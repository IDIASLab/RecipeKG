Also you don't have to use the oven to cook them. We'd just simmer ours (covered) on low heat for around 40 minutes in the same skillet that they were browned in, adding more liquid as needed. You can also transfer them to a crockpot after browning them. As far as seasoning, it was always what was on hand. On day they might be cooked with canned tomatoes, the next with a mushroom sauce or brown gravy. My Dad used to cook us porcupine meatballs often when I was growing up, and I had all but forgot about them until I came across this recipe. Grandpa used to tell my Dad that this recipe was \"good home cooking\" when they were children, and that still holds true today.",

I believe the original recipe was like this one, but I have modified it to give it more flavor and \"zing.\"  The first modification I made was to use instant rice.  It seems to \"glue\" the porcupines together better, so no eggs or bread is needed.  I also add diced green pepper to the meatball mixture.  After placing the porcupines in the baking dish, I top with 2 can of Rotel with juice, eliminating the need for water.  Just before removing from the oven, I sprinkle on cheese (sharp cheddar is our favorite, but use whatever suits your tastebuds) and return to the oven just until cheese melts.  I make these for company all the time and everyone always asks for the recipe.",

I prefer the soup I think it has a better taste. I know several complained about the rice. I have found after several tries you have to use either pre-cooked rice or instant rice. I prefer the pre-cooked but either will work. I left the water out so I didn't have the issue of my meatballs falling apart but they were also a little dry. I would recommend Zesty Porcupine Balls also from this site instead of this recipe. So far I think they are the best.

I pour the tomato sauce over it during the last part of baking. Just season these like you would a meatloaf or hamburgers.  Really good !!",
