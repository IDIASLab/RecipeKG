You can get creative and add raisins or cranberry's and celery which you would add at the same time you do the onions and take it up a notch. Also slivered almonds or pine nuts would be wonderful in it too for some \"crunch\". I love a recipe that is healthy tasty and you can get creative and add things to it...that wouldn't be changing the recipe just enhancing it.",
