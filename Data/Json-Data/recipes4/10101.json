If you do not have a very large skillet reduce the onions to 8 and the mushrooms to 8 as well. The bacon flavor is essential to this dish so I recommend frying a few pieces of bacon in place of the bacon bits. Use only a dry red wine that you would drink (and enjoy)-- I recommend a Pinot Noir for this dish.",

It was too winey and the sauce had no depth. I would try adding a teaspoon or 2 of tomato paste if I tried this again. I probably won't because Emeril Lagasse's recipe is sooo much better it's worth the extra few minutes of prep work! Thanks anyway Kelly!",

First of all I fried up fresh bacon removed it and then browned the chicken (which I seasoned with salt pepper onion and garlic powders) in the bacon fat. I then removed the chicken drained most of the fat added flour then sauteed the vegetables including garlic cloves. Once browned I added chicken broth tomato paste and the seasonings and let it simmer for about a minute. I replaced the chicken the transfered it to my oven for about ninety minutes. Delicious dish Kelly and I thank you for a terrific start!",
