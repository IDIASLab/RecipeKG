Used 2 chicken breasts simmered in olive oil with crushed garlic and italian seasoning until done. Put the chicken in a blender on 'salsa' to chop it up (much easier than tearing with forks!). Added the oil (which was about 1/8 cup) 1/2 c bread crumbs 15oz ricotta 1/2 c mozz 1/4 c parmesean and mixed together. Used 1/2 box of shells boiled and stuffed then refridgerated for the next day. I get home much later than my boyfriend so it was convenient to just pour jarred alfredo and some mozz throw it in the oven for 30 mins.",

(The chicken was already herbed so I didn't use basil or oregano.) I mixed the egg with 8 oz ricotta cheese and maybe 4 oz of parmesan and added some dried parsley (to make it more like lasagna cheese which I adore). Then I added about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. I tossed the chicken and egg/cheese mixture in a skillet and heated it to melt the cheeses adding in a few handfuls of mozzarella as well. It looked a little dry (especially with the bread crumbs) so I tossed in three tablespoons or so of sour cream. For the tomato sauce I used a 28-oz bottle of spaghetti sauce and added a can of diced tomatoes as well. When I put everything in the pan I first poured in a layer of tomato sauce so that the shells wouldn't stick to the pan. It turned out beautifully and the stuffing is creamy and delicious. Thank you!",

The shells were easy to stuff as the stuffing mixture sticks together very easily. The only thing I changed the second time I made it was taking out the cheddar cheese and doubling the mozzarella and using a jarred spaghetti sauce instead of the plain tomato sauce. Very good!!",
