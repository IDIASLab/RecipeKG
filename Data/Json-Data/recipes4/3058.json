The only problem I had was that the popcorn needed to be stirred sooner than 5 minutes (more like 1-2 minutes) or it was going to burn. I also only roasted it for maybe about 8 minutes. By the way I was temped to skip the time in the oven and I am glad it did not it mellowed the flavors and blended them nicely. Thanks for the recipe.",

I also used seasoning salt instead of regular salt. I baked it but only for about 7 or so minutes as I got concerned about burning it. One thing I did do was line a baking sheet with some parchment paper before I put the popcorn down. This made removal easy because I was able to just lift out the parchment paper and it made cleanup even easier (no greasy pans). Thanks for the recipe!",
