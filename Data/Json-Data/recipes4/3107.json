I don't know what people are talking about with the sauce being too thin...it was perfect when using the exact proportions as written.  Too give this an extra kick, try adding a dollop of sour cream on each serving.  I thought I had the best chicken enchilada recipe.  Not anymore!  This is my new one!!! Thanks for a great recipe! You know, I just went back and read the opening paragraph where the author said she usually doubled the whipping cream and chicken broth.  I think that would make this recipe PERFECT!  Just wish I had read that part before I made this batch, which by the way, made TWO complete meals for a family of four.  I cooked one pan and froze the other.",

I did make two changes: 1. used a rotisserie chicken from Costco for chicken meat - great time saver 2. did not put green chilies in the filling, instead I used them in the sauce which I substituted from another recipe on this site. The sauce is 1/4 c. butter, 1/4 c. flour- melt butter, stir in flour and cook several minutes. Stir in 2 c. chicken broth and heat until thickened. Off heat, whisk in 1 c. sour cream and 4 oz green chilies. Pour over enchiladas and then top with cheese. Bake per recipe instructions. The heat of this dish is on the milder side, so I think I will add green chilies to the filling next time. Definitely will make again.",
