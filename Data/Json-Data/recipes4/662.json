I always find that I have to bake it for 28 min, flipping it the last 5 minutes to help the dough cook inside (basically I cook until both sides are golden).  I've made this 50+ times & anything less.. the dough in the middle sometimes comes out uncooked which is embarrassing.  Also, it's best to not try to stretch out the pizza dough.  Just open it, stretch to only flatten it & use.  Making it too thin only breaks the dough & the pepperoni juices will leak out.  I'm always about adding MORE to things, but remember \"less is perfection\" in this case.  The more you stuff into this dough, the less appetizing it tastes.  Trust me, I've tried several times & it's the reason only \"I\" make it right in my family!  Just sprinkle the ingredients, roll it, and bake.  Adding some sort of italian seasoning really adds a nice touch.  We use ranch or marinara sauce to dip, and people are begging for the recipe!  UPDATE:  The frozen philsbury french loaf works wonderful w/this recipe too! Another poster recommended microwaving the pepperoni for 30-40 sec before cooking, and what a great idea! I then bake until brown on each side (as I mentioned above).",

These two appetizers were the first to dissapear! In fact many postponed their games just to get up and grab more! I had pizza sauce for dipping but hardly anyone used it! These are similar to pizza pinwheels but less greasy and more taste due to the different cheeses & meats! Will make these puppies again!
