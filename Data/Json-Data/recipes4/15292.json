The version I made was probably 3 stars. The day I made this, I had ten minutes to get it in the crock pot before I ran out the door. I cored the cabbage and cut it into 4 wedges, put the entire bunch of chard in (stems and all), used an entire yellow bell pepper that had been cored and seeded, and 2 whole (peeled) smallish carrots, whole green onions and a celery stalk. I omitted kale. I roughly chopped 7 slices of bacon. I threw it all in the pot with water and seasonings and cooked it on high for 4 hours. I came home and blended it up with an immersion blender. Texture wise, it worked great! A nice, thin soup with no chunks. However, the chard and bell pepper taste were too strong. I should have halved both. I fixed it with more water and chicken bouillon, though. A couple days later, I did wind up boiling some sweet potatoes and adding them in to make the soup more hearty.",
