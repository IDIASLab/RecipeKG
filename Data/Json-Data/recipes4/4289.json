I did not have actual buttermilk so I used the old milk with vinegar trick. I always feel like I'm cheating when I do that. *laugh* One note: I followed the instructions to add some flour to the cast iron griddle. I found this not only unnecessary, but rather unpleasant. The flour burns which is unsightly and doesn't taste very good. After the first batch I wiped my pan clean, wiped it lightly with oil and much preferred those results. My pan is seasoned enough that it's probably fine without doing any of that so I will skip it altogether in the future. Great recipe!",
