I could have used a little more flavor, but that's not what this was advertised to be.  So in that respect, this fit the bill.  I do think that you could use less sauce for the amount of egg and ham.  A biscuit would maybe have produced more flavor, too, than my English muffin.  I'm thinking one of those biscuits with thyme or rosemary in it.  We did enjoy having this, and it served us well tonight for dinner.  Thanks, jeffy!",
