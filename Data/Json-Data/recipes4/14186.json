I cooked this as recommended and then after cooking I added 1 heaping tablespoon of sugar about 1 tsp of salt and 1/4 cup flour dissolved in 1/2 cup water to thicken. The sugar takes the edge off the sourness. The salt was just needed and the flour/water thicken. In order for gravies and sauces to be thick they require some sort of thickening agent. There aren't any thickening agents in this recipe so reviewers who complained about the sauce being runny should understand why the sauce is runny.",
