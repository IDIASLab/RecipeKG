I cooked the rice with 3 cups of chicken broth for about 30 minutes on the stovetop (until all the broth was absorbed). Like WATERGIRL1 I used frozen broccoli (petite florets) instead of the green beans. I also omitted the dill & water. I only added about a cup of milk -- just until the mixture looked slightly creamy. I also saved 1/2 cup of the cheese to sprinkle on top before putting it in the oven. Baked it for 1 hour it looked and tasted great. My family says it's a \"keeper\". Thanks GRLBUG for a good meal idea using brown rice.",

At least give a recipe a chance before you make sweeping changes and give it a bad rating. Maybe your changes are what messed it up. Just a thought.",
