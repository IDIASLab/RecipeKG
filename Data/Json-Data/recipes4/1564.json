The second time I added cooked sausage, scrambled eggs, O'brien potatoes and a mix of cheddar and pepperjack to stuff the enchiladas.  What a very pleasant surprise....  Quite tasty, in fact.  Just to experiment, I froze two of the enchiladas and am so very glad I did.  Had no idea what to expect as I have never had a reason to freeze scrambled eggs.  Popped them into the oven and when done, tasted as if they were freshly made.  Perfect to keep on hand for surprise overnight guests!",

I didn't use green chile enchilada sauce I used regular enchilada sauce that was mild. The can diced green chile peppers was enough to make it too spicy for me. 28 ounce can of enchilada sauce proved to be way too much. I think it will take experimenting to make this taste wonderful possibly some cooked eggs in it as well as mushrooms and get rid of the chile peppers. I think that it will be something I definitely will modify until I find something to suit my tastes. That being said - my husband didn't mind it but said it could use some changes as well.",
