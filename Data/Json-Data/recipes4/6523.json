Turns out my 87 year old grandmother remembered this type of recipe immediately- back in the day they called them impossible pies. For this recipe I saut\u00e9ed all the veggies together first in order to let the squash release its water. This kept the final product from being soggy. I omitted the oil and only used 1/8th tsp. Cayenne. Next time I will use less Italian seasoning but I really liked the use of paprika. Of course seasoning is a personal thing but I will use this recipe again and play around with it! Thanks for introducing me to this type of dish:-)",
