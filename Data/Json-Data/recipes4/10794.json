Adjust the seasonings appropriately more than likely a tsp of each will be fine. Forget the water & if the soups are too thick add some chicken broth or white wine. Cook in the crockpot only 6 hours at most; I had some turn out tough and rubbery yuck! I've also tried this with chicken breast cut into cubes and also boneless thighs which create a different flavor but still good. Fresh herbs work well but only add them the last hour of cooking or they will turn brown and unrecognizable. Thanks for all your reviews! Even the negative ones. One cannot grow without critisizm!",
