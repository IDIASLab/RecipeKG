It needs a sauce similar to au gratin potatoes: I would like to see someone post a comment or new recipe that incorporates a sauce to bind these ingredients together.  Since there is not much water, you have to be careful not to burn the sausage while you cook the potatoes.  (I think it would be better to put the potatoes in a few minutes after the sausage has been cooking.)  Also I used frozen hash brown potatoes to make it easier, but I should have put the onion in with the sausage, since it took longer to cook than the hash browns.  To summarize: start the sausage and onion at the same time.  Add the potatoes four minutes later with some kind of cheese sauce, then you would have a five star recipe.",
