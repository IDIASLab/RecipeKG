I was cleaning out the freezer of my husband's deer meat getting ready for the new season (didn't have any elk) and ended up using some white tail chops and stew meat (abt 2lbs). I normally always follow a new recipe as written (and would never rate it down if I made changes and didn't like it!) but ended up making a couple changes out of necessity and LOVED the results!   I couldn't find the cream of onion soup (have never heard of it either) so I used cream of mushroom.  I also used beef broth instead of water and chopped fresh sage leaves instead of rubbed which I was out of.  I browned the meat a bit before adding to the crock pot and deglazed the pan with the beef broth to get the browned bits and add more flavor to the dish.  Yes, a tiny bit more work but it was SO good!  I served it over rice and my husband and little ones loved it.  I may try adding some sauteed/browned mushrooms next time... This recipe is a keeper!",

I used elk stew meat instead of roast, which turned out so tender! and I didnt have cream of onion soup so I used cream of mushroom and added extra onion. I was in a hurry and accidently added sour cream in the beginning,but it still turned out. I also threw in some mushrooms for fun. My husband added some johnnys seasoning when my back was turned, and although it did make it taste better, the recipe was fine without it.I will definitely use this recipe again, maybe next time without the substitutions!",
