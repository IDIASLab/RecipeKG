I used small new red potatoes, so I didn't bother to peel them, and threw in a handful of peas that were in the freezer.  I think this is one of those recipes that you need to adjust the seasoning to your own taste preference, and that's what I did.  I scaled this down to 2 servings, but it easily could have served 3. Served this over egg noodles, and this simply is good, old-fashioned comfort food at its best.",
