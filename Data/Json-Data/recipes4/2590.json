My soup came out looking appetizing just a little lighter in color than a slice of pumpkin pie. I did make one major alteration: instead of topping it with blue cheese and bacon I fried a pound of bacon and wrapped each slice around a half a slice of Gouda cheese. I then rolled these into crescent rolls and served them with the soup encouraging people to dip them. This turned out to be a major hit!",
