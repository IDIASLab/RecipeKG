I boosted the oven temp to 375 for the first 30 minutes for the initial roasting, then reduced it to 325 until the drumsticks were done.  There was a large amount of liquid in the pan that never cooked off, so I will reduce the honey, orange juice, and butter to half of what is called for the next time I make this.  There would still be plenty of pan juices left for a thin gravy if desired.  In the directions, I think that the butter should be melted first, then brought to room temperature.  It will harden in the mixture when refrigerated, so it will be clumpy.  All in all, a nice departure and a great way to use an inexpensive cut of chicken.",

All said the chicken was a little to organgy so I would not recommend the extra orange zest that I mentioned having added. Good recipe though! I'll try it again for sure.",
