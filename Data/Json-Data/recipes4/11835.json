Near the end of cooking it was still really thick so I added a couple more cups of water. After salt & peppering it up it was pretty good. I've been craving something healthy like this and it hit the spot. While we ate I left this on the stove on low for another 30 minutes or so and it got better the longer it cooked. So if you have the time I'd recommend simmering on low for 30-40 minutes instead of 10 min. I will make this again.",
