I also added only 1Tbsp oregano and increased the italian seasoning to 2 Tbsp.  I poked holes in the roast and basted it with the juices about every hour or hour and a half.  It turned out very juicy.  We ate it as an entree the first day, and sliced it for hot roast beef sandwiches the next day.  Yum! UPDATE:  Due to my DH low cholesterol diet I now make this with only 1 TBSP of olive oil instead of a half cup.  It's still very good but a lot less fat.  You can also use a venison roast in place of beef (that cuts the fat to almost nothing!)",

I started it in the crock pot at noon put it on high & went outside to enjoy the beautiful weather, came in around 3 p.m. turned it to low, added quartered red potatoes, & sliced carrots, YUM!  I used \"Italian Dressing Mix\" (from this site) for the dry italian mix and because that has a significant amount of oregano & basil, I didn't add any extra.  I used 1 can of reduced sodium beef broth instead of the water & 2 bouillon cubes and I will cut the oil amount in 1/2 next time because I thought it to be too much.  The roast (I did use a rump) came out very tender & juicy, not much left over and I had a 5.5 lb. roast!  Will make again!  Thanks Michelle!!",

I cooked it all day in the slow cooker which made it extremely tender. The smell while it cooked was heavenly and the finished product was deliciuos! Will make again for sure.",
