I followed the directions however I made this change: I make curries a lot and the idea of just adding curry powder/spices to water seemed like madness to me. I also wanted to double the spices so I decided to split the difference. I put half of my spices into the beef/onion mixture when the beef was mostly cooked to fry the spices (the way I'm used to preparing curry spices) and I added half of the spices to the boiling water as the recipe suggests. Basically I followed the recipe exactly but fried another batch of the spices with the beef. I also stirred the rice around in the fried curry/onion/beef oils on gentle heat before adding the water. This came out deliciously! Oh and be careful to set your heat fairly low during the rice-cooking part of the process (On my stove I set it at about 3.5/10). It will still simmer with lower heat but if you don't put the heat pretty low and stir occasionally it will probably burn on the bottom.",
