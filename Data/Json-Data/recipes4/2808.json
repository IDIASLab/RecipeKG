The single most time consuming thing was peeling the lower half of the asparagus stalks so they cook up nice and tender.(I learned that technique from Julia Child & \"Lessons with Master Chefs\") I tripled the recipe making 6 large stuffed chicken breasts and 10 or 12 asparagus/bacon bundles. The stuffing mixture seemed to make LOT of stuffing I will adjust some amounts downward next time. Oh I used Stovetop stuffing mix with a little chiken broth instead of cornbread in the stuffing. Other than that I followed the recipe. The chicken breasts were dee-licious! The veggie stuffing was very moist and flavorful and the chicken was very moist and tender. All dinner guests agreed this recipe was a keeper! The baked asparagus was not too bad well pretty good actually but the tips of the asparagus got a bit dried out and scorched in the baking process. The bacon was a yummy addition though. I had thick asparagus stalks so I only wrapped two or three stalks in each bundle. I had leftovers from this meal both chicken and asparagus and they were quite delicious the next day warmed up in the microwave for lunch.",

(In my mind cornbread and parmesan don't go together) As another member recommended I made a gravy from the pan drippings and I'm glad I did...it was a little on the dry side. (Maybe cover it w/tinfoil while it cooks?) The bacon wrapped asparagus was a HUGE hit!! For me though it took almost twice the time to get the bacon crisp even after turning it over once...maybe ovens vary. But as the recipe title states it absolutely is an elegant looking meal.",

A really nice warm in your belly evening meal. I followed the recipe quite close just scaling down on the stuffing ingredients and using a box of stuffing instead of cornbread. I served with just steamed veggies but did cut the chicken as suggested and made a gravy with the drippings. (Add chicken stock and/or liquid chicken oxo to the bottom of the dish to get drippings for gravy) Just great! Do try.",

The stuffing was very tasty a nice mix of savory and a little sweet from the cornbread addition. I did have more than enough stuffing for 2 breasts though. This is definitely a dish that it suitable for dinner guests but it's a nice everyday dish too. Adjustments I made: I put the veggies in a food processor before cooking as I didn't want any large chunks of veggies. I also added a little fresh tarragon to the stuffing and I put a small amount of chicken broth in the bottom of the baking dish for basting. (can use this to make gravy too)",
