It took me a while to roll them out but I am sure that is just my lack of talent...The only thing I would recommend is to put them on a towel after cooking them and stacking them up or the bottom one tends to get pretty soggy! Thanks for a delicious recipe! I just made these again and let them sit for about thirty minutes (covered) instead of ten after kneading. They rolled out MUCH better and tasted just great still!",

I have tried several tortilla recipes recently trying to find a good one since store bought tortillas have so many wierd preservatives and additives. These are definitely the easiest and best recipe that I have tried. Husband loved them too. Used them for enchiladas. Followed recipe exactly dough seemed dry at first but turned out to be just right after kneading for 5 min. Very easy to roll out didn't even need to flour countertop. Cooked each side over medium heat for about 45 to 60 seconds didn't oil or spray pan or anything. Next time I might try using some whole wheat flour for some of the white and see how it turns out.",
