I used beef stew meat instead of top round steak, a whole onion instead of half, 8 ounces of fresh mushrooms instead of canned, 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1, a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce instead of just a teaspoon, 1/2 cup of red wine instead of 1/4 cup of white wine and 1/4 cup of water, a tablespoon of cornstarch in addition to the flour, just 8 ounces of sour cream instead of 16, and added 4 ounces of cream cheese. I followed the same directions, except adding the fresh mushrooms at the end for just the last hour of cooking. So, after all of those changes - it has become THE Stroganoff recipe for our family!",

                "reviewBody": "Soooo good!  I dissolved the beef bouillon in 1 Tbl. water before adding.  I used 1/2 the sour cream, as others suggested (light or fat-free sour cream works just fine), and it was perfect!  I also used a package of fresh mushrooms, layered last on the top.  Mine needed to cook only 5 hours on low.  My preference is thickly sliced onions, instead of chopped ones, and to stir in the sour cream just before serving.  Serve on a platter with egg noodles around the edges, and the beef stroganoff in the middle - very pretty display.  Steamed broccoli goes well with this dish.  One note:  I made this once with double the meat, so I doubled the sauce ingredients -- bad idea!  It had WAY too much liquid.  Next time I double the meat, I will leave the other ingredients as stated.  Note:  After reading another review, I decided to sprinkle the meat with garlic powder as well, increase the Worcestershire to 1 Tbl., increase the garlic to 2 cloves, leave off the bouillon and water, increase the wine to 1/2 cup, and add 1 Tbl. cornstarch in addition to the flour (I mixed it with the wine).  All WONDERFUL suggestions.  Big difference in the flavor & thickness of the sauce (had been too watery before).  Thanks for the recipe!",

The cut of meat should probably be beef stewing meat, it does better than a lean cut in a slow cooker.  I used fresh mushrooms, green onions instead of chives, beef broth in place of bouillon and wine, and only used 8 oz. sour cream.  To thicken it up more, I added 4 oz. cream cheese with the sour cream, and I also boiled my noodles til al dente' and added them to the crock.  After an hour, it was the perfect consistency.

I read all the comments and proceeded like this: I used London broil cuz that's what i always use for stroganoff. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I used red wine in place of the white wine and water; beef needs red wine, not white. I opted for the suggestion to replace the sour cream with 4 oz. of cream cheese and 8 oz. of sour cream (added 30 minutes before serving). I whisked a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch with some of the sauce and whisked that mixture back into the pot right before the addition of the sour cream/cream cheese. The sauce ended with a perfect consistency and exceptional flavor. I served it with a spinach salad. This is a real keeper!",

My husband the traditional stroganoff fan said \"This is savory stuff you've made here.\" The last time I tried a crock pot stroganoff dish he wasn't thrilled with it. But I've learned to recognize when a recipe doesn't have enough spices for us and to add more in. With this recipe I added a couple shakes of minced onions garlic salt Lawry's seasoned salt and garlic powder. I went heavy on the pepper and it turned out just right. I used 2 tsp beef boullion granules (not sure if that's equal to a cube but it worked) 2 tsp worcestershire chicken stock instead of water and wine and a little dash of old champagne because I didn't have white wine handy. Used small can of mushrooms as well as 8oz pkg fresh mushrooms. That works out really well if you're a mushroom lover like us. Doubled the minced garlic to two cloves. May bring it down to just one next time since I also sprinkle garlic powder. Definitely taste the sauce before you let it simmer for 8 hours. If it doesn't have enough flavor add more spices in upfront. We used about 12oz sour cream. My husband likes the taste of sour cream. I asked him if he'd like more and he said it was perfect as is.",

I used 1/2 c. chicken broth instead of the wine and water (chicken broth is my go-to liquid for all recipes; we never have wine in the house) and deglazed the meat-searing pan with it before adding to the crockpot. I also used about 1 T. worcestershire sauce some chopped green onions fresh mushrooms (who uses canned mushroom?) and only 8 oz of lite sour cream (it tasted creamy this way and who needs the extra fat and calories).
