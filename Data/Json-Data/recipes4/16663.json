I had a ham bone that I was saving in my freezer and it worked quite well with this recipe. \nI did swap the celery with asparagus. I also used an immersion blender once the potatoes were soft and made it all into a creamy chowder consistency. This eliminated the need for the water/flour step. It thickened up quite nicely and also \"hid\" the veggies for my picky daughter (and picky husband). I added the cream still, along with a little shredded cheese.\nI will definitely make this soup again.",
