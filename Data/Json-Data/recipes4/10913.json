I also frequently add mushrooms or onions; I have served it over rice, pasta, egg noodles, potatoes; I adjust the liquid (wine/water/broth) depending on who's eating.

After I initially cooked the chicken, I pulled them off and then put 3 T flour and 3 T butter in the pan.  After that was slightly browned and bubbly I whisked in the wine and water.  It wasn't clumpy at all.  In went a bunch of fresh rosemary, thyme and oregano, then the chicken.  Make sure you check your chicken!  That's why the recipe says \"or until chicken is cooked through\".  If it was overcooked, that's not the recipe's fault.  :)  15 more minutes is what it took for mine.",
