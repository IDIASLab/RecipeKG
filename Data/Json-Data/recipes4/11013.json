I cooked the chicken for 2 hours at which point the meat was falling off the bones, so I stopped then.  It took a lot longer than 30 minutes to get the fat to congeal (probably about 2 hrs) so the overall cooking time was about the same.  I didn't add the second tsp of salt as the bouillon is already so salty.  Definitely a keeper!",

It'll be done in less than one. It adds salt twice (Thrice if you include the bouillon.) Always add salt LAST or it will make things tough (Even rice). You start with fresh parsley and switch to dry (???) when once is enough. You add celery twice when once will do. Still it makes good soup. But simpler would be better.;-)",
