Baked the hash browns in the oven, in the bottom of my casserole dish after mixing them with a little olive oil, salt and pepper.  Mixed precooked sausage and veggies in with egg and cheese.  After cooking onion, I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic and a big handful of chopped baby spinach.  Poured over hash browns.  Added a sprinkle of cheese to the top and broiled for 2 more minutes.  Great and simple ingredients in this recipe.  Lots of egg and less milk than most recipes.  I like that.",

My changes were that I used spicy turkey sausage instead of bacon and I threw in one chopped de-ribbed/seeded fresh jalapeno. YUM! I wasn't able to find a package of hashbrowns at 16 ounces so I got a 30 ounce package and eyeballed about half. Honestly I could have added all of it without overflowing the baking dish and it wouldn't have been too potatoey (yep... just made that word up). Helpful hints: if you are using an egg substitute please note that 12 eggs comes to about 2.5 cups. In addition I cracked each egg into a small bowl and then added them one by one to the mixing bowl to ensure that no shell pieces got into the final mixture... easier to take a few pieces out of one small bowl before cracking the next egg than trying to fish them out of a huge bowl full of eggs. Also I would suggest adding the seasoning to the veggies as you saute them... just easier in my opinion.",
