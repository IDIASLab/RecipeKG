I wish i had listened when I read that in the reviews. the rice will absorb all the gravy and become a mushy mess. Alternatively if you want rice with your dish I suggest you prepare it separately then use the gravy to pour over the rice. I also started by coating the wings in flour and browning them a bit in some oil before adding them to my pre heated crockpot. Turned out amazing FELL OFF THE BONES :)",
