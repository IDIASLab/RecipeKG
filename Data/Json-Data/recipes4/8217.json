I've tried both ways, and both are delicious.  The sauce here is a very good one, and the meatballs were not only easy to make but very tasty.  I cut the recipe in half and got 15 meatballs using my middle cookie scoop which made them about 1 1/2\" big.  I'd advise others not to go overhanded on the garlic (I used a little more than called for thinking that turkey doesn't taste that much); the amount called for is spot on.  I made two subs on this: chicken broth rather than beef broth and pappardelle pasta rather than egg noodles--neither one making much difference in the long run.  I would definitely make these again!  Thanks for the recipe!",
