I then added the 2T chardonnay to my OJ reduction and continued the recipe as written, though with my already-thick reduction sauce, I did not have to add the cornstarch/water step. Served with green beans, and steamed brown basmati rice with a bit of butter, chardonnay, and drizzled with a some of the orange sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe, HAC3!",
