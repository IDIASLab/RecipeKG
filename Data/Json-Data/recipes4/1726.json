I used store brand swiss cheese and this was really good but it needed a tad more taste so next time I will use an aged swiss or fontina cheese. Hubby suggested we add cubed potatoes green peppers onion and mushrooms too or other cheeses to change this up and make this again often. Both my husband and I liked this a lot but my teen who is my typically my adventurous eater and rarely turns his nose up at anything didn't care for this at all. Great with a side of hashbrowns and toast. Thanks for this recipe we had a wonderful meal!",
