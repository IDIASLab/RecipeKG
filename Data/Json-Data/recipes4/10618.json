First, I peel and slice the potatoes, medium slices, then I heat a fry pan with 1 tablespoon of cooking oil and lightly brown the pork chops. I take the pork chops out of the fry pan and set aside. Save the oil and drippings in the fry pan. \n Now, in the baking pan cover the bottom with 1 layer of potato slices, cover slices with a little coating of the soup mixture, continue layering the potatoes and soup in a similar manner, until all of the potato slices and soup mixture is used. Next, take the oil and drippings from browning the pork chops and pour over the top of the soup and and potatoes. Place the pork chops on TOP. This way the juices from the chops run down into the soup and potatoes, making them taste less bland. The potatoes cook all the way through this way, too. Cover with foil, then bake. For the last 10 minutes of baking, remove the foil.",

I made a few modifications (sliced onions mushrooms fresh garlic and even some sliced sausage mixed in with the potatoes on top). Also I added Essence and Italian Seasoning to the chops. I scaled it down for 2 chops & only used ONE can of Cream/Room soup and milk/cooking sherry mix for the liquid instead of water. BTW my potatoes were cooked fully cooked PERFECT. I also covered it for the entire hour for fear of not enough liquid and/or drying out. Hubby LUVED it doesn't have to be served immediately either. It \"sits\" VERY well:) Thank you!
