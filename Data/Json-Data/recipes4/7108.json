This is a very popular dish at our house, and it could not be easier! Instead of rubbing the roast with the onion soup mix and then adding the cranberry sauce, you can also just mix the onion soup mix with the cranberry sauce and pour the whole mixture over the roast.",

The only thing I do differently is add about 1/2 cup of white wine with the onion soup mix and cranberry sauce.  I make the gravy right in the crock pot on high for 15 minutes while the roast rests covered with foil. I have even used a frozen pork loin on high in the crock-pot for 5 hours.  Very tender meat and delicious gravy. I often serve it with spatzle dumplings and applesauce.",

Instead of the Onion Soup Mix, I had Lipton's Vegetable Soup Mix, so I put the meat in the slow cooker, emptied the soup on top of the meat; I had dried cranberries, piled them on top, added about a cup of Chicken Broth, then added some cutup potatoes, carrots and 2 celery stalks.  Followed the recipe from there.  The 2 tbsp of flour with some melted butter I did as instructed and then took that and poured it into the juice, which was very lumpy because of the cranberries.  I can not believe how delicious this was.  I was afraid I might have ruined a perfectly good pork roast and it ended up coming out absolutely delicious.  Will save as a favorite!  Thanks Lawrence for the recipe idea!",

                "reviewBody": "First of all I want to say that my family and I LOVE \"GOOD\" food and are not picky at all.  I used a 5lb frozen pork loin roast, doubled the amount of Lipton Onion Soup Mix (2 pkgs.) and 2 cans of ocean spray whole berry cranberry sauce (which are 14-1/2 oz each NOT 16oz.) We like a lot of sauce/gravy!  I seasoned my roast then rubbed with the soup mix, then placed in my crockpot set for 8 hours, poured \"mixed\" cranberry sauce over roast and covered.  Roast was completely cooked and extremely moist (and not falling/shredding apart) after 6 hours so I removed and let it rest for a couple of hours while I prepared my herb roasted potatoes and asparagus.  I proceeded to make a roux with butter and flour (ingredients doubled) and then slowly mixed it in the gravy.  I have to say the roast was AMAZING and sliced beautifully.  The gravy tasted good at first but then I started not liking it as much.  My husband liked it and said it was \"different\" but my boys 15 and 10 ate it BUT were not fond of it.  Actually they said they would prefer if I didn't make it again.  Anyway, I did make some Polish egg noodles after tasting the gravy thinking it would pair together better which it did.  Just NOT our favorite.  If you like REALLY REALLY SWEET sauce/gravy, this is definitely for you.  I don't think I will make this again, SORRY!  I'm not one to use \"pre-packaged\" anything so maybe that's why I wasn't impressed with the flavors (NOT SURE). Thanks for the experience though!~",
