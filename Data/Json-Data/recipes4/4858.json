To make the bread easier to form to the muffin cups I used the top of a drinking glass to cut a circle then flattened the circle with a rolling pin just a touch. I was worried that the bacon and cheese wouldn't be enough but the recipe was just right for each \"cup\". It's almost like a shortcut Egg in a Basket. Thanks so much for a new favorite--I'll make these again and again.",

I forgot to trim the crusts and ran out of butter stuff since I used the back of a spoon instead of a brush and did both sides of the bread. I used large eggs and they ran over the top as the standard size muffins cups overfilled. No matter they still tasted fine. Great idea and great little recipe! Thanks.",
