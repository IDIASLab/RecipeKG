Instead of using powdered saffron, I went to an Indian store and purchase saffron threads, they are much cheaper compare to the American grocer.  I put the saffron thread with boiling water, mush it with the back of the spoon to help release more of the flavor before pouring it to the rice.  For one cup of rice I used a little less than 1/4 tsp of thread.  I hope this helps!",
