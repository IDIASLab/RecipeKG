The chips, cheese, and beans really soak up the smoke flavor in just a few minutes. Smoke is the most important ingredient, so a charcoal grill is required (unless you can use wood chips in your gas grill). We usually serve it as an appetizer, but it is often requested as the main dish.",

I used yellow corn tortilla chips instead of white for more color and I had a handful of sliced black olives that I threw in the mix and they worked nicely. The smoke flavor didn't come through as strong as I would have liked so next time I'll use some wood chips for the chicken as well. Overall great recipe and one that is sure to please.",

You could smell the smoky flavor just standing near the pan it definitely permeated everything in the pan! Good grades from all!",
