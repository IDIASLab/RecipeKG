I stuffed the cavity with onion rather than carrots and used Paula Deen's house seasoning to season the bird. The bacon on top was to die for and my husband and I ended up fighting over it. The sauce was a little sweet with a slight citrus flavor thanks to the orange juice. I boiled it down slightly and thickened with some cornstarch and water. I will make this again for sure.",

It must reach an internal temp of 180. I went to 185 and it was still very moist. this meal was GREAT and the bacon was awesome.
