It was a great winter night soup and praised by the whole group! I did not use the celery (personal preference) but used a couple cans of cream of celery soup to give the flavor and make the broth more hearty. This is a keeper!",

Instead of leeks and celery (which I never buy) I used cooking onions and broccoli. I don't like dill so I left this out. I used 1/2 tsp pepper. I also added more broth - 9 cups instead of 6 (maybe because I added quite a bit of broccoli). I didn't have time to use the slow cooker so I boiled the soup for 20-30 min. There didn't seem to be a need for the butter since the vegetables were not being fried first. My family really enjoyed this! It used up a lot of leftovers in the fridge and took very little time to prepare! My husband is lactose intolerant so it was a plus that the soup did not use any dairy.",
