I added a little mayo and some avacado slices. These were so good - perfect with some kettle cooked chips and a dill pickle. You just can't go wrong with a BLT!",

A good substitution is chicken instead of bacon. I love this exact recipe with nice grilled spicy chicken. Also get some sour cream and salsa into two bowls and dip the wraps into them. This exact recipe is at a favourite restaurant of mine except they use chicken. The dips are nice to add some sauce if you want.",
