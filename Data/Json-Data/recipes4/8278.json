One change I made was freezing mine for about 15 minutes before broiling. I think chilling mozzarella sticks keeps them together better. I broiled them just until a few started to ooze a little, about 4 1/2 minutes. I really enjoyed them and would definitely make them again.",

I definitely recommend using the toothpicks as it made it so easy to coat the mozzarella sticks without making a big mess. I should've took them out a minute sooner but I got distracted (shocking I know lol) so that's why they oozed a little but they were still awesome! I will def be making these again and again as they make a great healthier snack or side YUM YUM YUM!!!!!! Thanks for sharing.:)",
