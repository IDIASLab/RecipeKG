A few thoughts from me: 1/2 C oil is more than you will probably need 1/4 to 1/3 C is more like it. Also this may sound obvious but a good way to tell if you've used enough salt and pepper is just to taste one of the veggie slices! For cooking times things like onion mushrooms and bell pepper need more time on the grill. Zucchini needs less time and the tomatoes even less- you just want the outsides to blister. For prep fewer of your veggie pieces will fall through the grate of the grill if you cut them properly. Slice the bell pepper into long wide pieces (so maybe just 6 pieces from an entire bell pepper) and cut the zucchini at a 45 degree angle so you have large slices. Lay them on the grill so the length of the bell pepper slices and zucchini slices are perpendicular to the grate. You may lose some of the pieces but not as many! I would honestly avoid grilling the veggies in a foil packet because they'll end up steamed which is much less tasty. Last of all veggies like asparagus and even broccoli are wonderful grilled. Try whatever you can think of. Good luck and happy grilling:)",

I use a yellow crook neck squash instead of one of the zucchini and use orange bell pepper as that is what we prefer. I use a grill basket with a basket weave lid chop all veggies into about 3/4\" pieces and toss them into the basket after tossing them with fresh garlic olive oil and Spicy Steak Seasoning (The loose herbs in the jar NOT steak sauce). I place the basket on the grill and shake and flip every 5 minutes or so. The flavor is incredible. If you use a foil packet all you are doing is steaming the vegetables. A superb way to add extra flavor to veggies.",
