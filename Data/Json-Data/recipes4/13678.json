The meat will cook nicely without it. I don't bother with the food processor, either. Don't make anything more time consuming than it has to be; just throw sliced onion and apple in the pot with the roast. I omit flour and add sage to rub on the pork. I put the carrots in the pot with the roast and cook it an hour less than the recipe says.  Lastly, apple juice will work in a pinch, since apple cider isn't always available, but you won't get the same flavor. Cider is stronger and will add more flavoring and shouldn't be watered down with so much water. There's no need for almost five cups of liquid in a slow cooker. Other than a few minor and easy changes, this recipe is the best way to cook a pork loin. It's fast, easy and oh, so tasty!",

We live at just over 7 000 feet above sea level so this affects cooking time. Usually I have to cook things longer but this meal would have been best for us served after 5 hours since I cooked on a gas stove-top rather than a slow cooker.

We felt there was a lot of liquid and would have been better if it was thicker. I probably should have browned the pork longer because the flower coating was just kind of mushy when we pulled it out. The pork was really tender moist and had a good flavor. We enjoyed it. I hope others try this recipe and add their comments of how they tweaked it. I'd like to try it again and see where I went wrong.",
