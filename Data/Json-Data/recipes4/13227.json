They need to cook until they are brown, at least 30 minutes. Five to seven minutes is not enough. If they are not caramelized, the dish loses its main flavor and will be bland. Also, I recommend caramelizing the onions in a large pot, and then adding the lentils and other ingredients to that pot, not adding the onions to the lentils' pot. That way you don't lose the juices and sugars from the onions.",

There were a few simple changes I made to adjust this recipe to my taste. first off, I cut the salt in half, I prefer lower sodium. I also like a little more spice so I added 1/4 tsp curry powder. Lastly I added 1 chopped carrot, for added flavor,texture and color. I accompanied this dish with warm artisan sourdough bread.\nI think this is a wonderful dish for a cold day to warm up your family and keep them healthy.  ",

I served this as a side dish to the Lahmahjoon (Armenian Pizza) recipe. I had some lamb bones left from that recipe which I used to make a stock to substitute for the water in this recipe. I also added a little bit of cucumber and mint to the yogurt sauce just because I had them on hand. It was delicious. The ingredients list calls for a lemon wedge but the directions indicate lime. Either would be delicious but we used lime. My kids gobbled this up and asked for more. I can t wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Thank you so much for a recipe we will make over and over!",
