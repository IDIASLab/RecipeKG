The recipe does not mention what to do with the bacon grease after cooking the bacon; I drained the majority of it after cooking, leaving a teaspoon or so to saute the shallots. I think much more would have made the sauce too greasy. Also, be warned that cooking the sprouts as recommended on a cookie sheet leaves them very al dente. I prefer mine a little softer. If I make this again, which I probably will, I most likey will steam the sprouts instead. Soaking them in the salt water did a nice job of removing the bitterness usually associated with the vegetable and was a good trick - one I will use again. Thanks for a nice recipe!",

I used half-and-half in place of cream and button mushrooms instead of criminis. (Both items were on hand and a grocery run was out.) My sherry was just regular \"Dry Sherry\" also. Normally I try to avoid a lot of substitutions when making a recipe for the first time but I don't believe these changed the final outcome significantly. I loved the depth of flavor that roasting the sprouts added to this dish. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!",
