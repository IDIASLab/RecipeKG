Same bottle style and look as taco sauce but labled as Chipotle Sauce.\nI cooked the meat with the stated 1/4c.\nof Chipotle Sauce. I also added a generous sprinkling of Mrs. Dash Southwest Chipotle seasoning. This stuff is great, pure flavor because it is not salt based. Once the meat was done, I put the gravy in the frig so the fat/grease would rise to the top and congeal...then removed the fat/grease. Poured the defatted gravy over the shredded meat and added the remainder of the 8 oz. bottle of Chipotle Sauce and a sprinkling more of the Mrs. Dash S-West Chiptotle seasoning. The end result tasted just like Chipotle's shredded meat - fantastic ! It had tons of flavor contrary to the complaints of other reviewers. I also salted the rice after it was done cooking. Additional suggestions for serving this: serve with black beans and corn.",

Also, instead of the water, I used a bottle of Corona beer and squeezed 1/4 of a lime on top of the pork in the crock pot.  I simmered the meat for about 4 hours on low.

I didn't bother with the rice, but instead added the lime juice (1 lime) and cilantro in with the chipotle sauce (I found it in the Mexican section at Meijer). I marinaded it over night, then cooked for 6 hrs on low. I added a little more chipotle sauce for a little more flavor. We had it with warm flour tortillas, guacamole, grated Cheddar, and plain white rice. Absolutely AWESOME! I would not hesitate in making this again. Thanks, Tora. V!",

It's found in the produce sections of most U.S. supermarkets.  Google \"Mexican grocery UK\" and you will find websites that sell chipotle sauce, or you can look up a Chipotle Sauce recipe right here on allrecipes.com.  Chipotle is a smoke-dried jalapeno pepper - look up wikipedia.com for excellent photos and descriptions.  The smokiness adds an awesome flavor dimension!  For both the cilantro and sauce, I would start with half the recipe amount and add more until you find the flavor profile you like.",

To give it more flavor since the people in my family like spice: double the chipolte sauce and add another can of chilies. Also: add some lime juice in with the rest of the ingredients. And if you do not want to mess with the rice: throw chopped cilantro (the more the better I think) into the pork when you shred it, then let it sit the fifteen minutes or longer afterwards. I think this recipe cannot sit in the slow cooker too long, so do not worry about that. Thanks for the fabulous addition to my recipe box! Actually making it for dinner again tonight!",

I followed the recipe exactly and even threw in some chopped onion and southwest chipotle seasoning for extra flavor. We had it in tacos with tomato cilantro and cheese garnish. It was extremely bland and lacking flavor. I was surprised even after using the entire bottle of chipotle sauce. I won't make this again.",
