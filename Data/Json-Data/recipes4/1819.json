Rolled it up and secured with kitchen twine. Rubbed the outside with olive oil, salt and pepper, and roasted at 400* for about 20 minutes. Delicious.",

Now i tweaked it a bit.  i used thick boneless centercuts instead of chops.  Gruyere instead of gouda and added diced, skinless apple to the mix.  i seasoned the chops with a little salt, pepper, and spicy mustard.  Heated up an indoor grill and seared them for 7 minutes each side, then broiled them for 3 minutes after topping them with the remaining filling. My boyfriend went crazy over them!!!  ",

( 2 1/2 \") I secured the chops with a metal pick. I dusted with flour and browned them in the bacon grease, about 3 minutes each side.  Then I put them in the oven , seam side UP and baked about  20  minutes at 350.  I watched them closely.  My chops were very cold when I  put them in the oven.  One chop was enough for the two of us.   The second time I made them, I browned them in a little Olive Oil and then grilled them.  I didn't add apple. I think I liked them grilled a little better, but both  times  5 stars. Both times,  very, very good.  It is an easy recipe. I used good quality smoked Gouda.  Don't substitute the cheese, that is what makes them so good. You can make them ahead of time, refrigerate and  bake later.  A great company dish.",

I cooked my bacon crisp and did 6 slices instead of 4. I used a bit more cheese to but other then that did everything as stated. My butcher suggested i use cooking twine and lace it over the tooth picks that i used to seal the slit, i did and it worked out great. I didn't loose any of the goodies from inside the stuffed pocket. Thanks for a great recipe!!",
