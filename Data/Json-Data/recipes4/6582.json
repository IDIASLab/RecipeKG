The only thing I did differently was build it more like another casserole I make - I mixed the pasta and the cream cheese (and added some green onions for fun) and spread that in the bottom of the casserole dish. I simmmered the sauce with the meat and seasonings for a few minutes and then layered that on top of the pasta in the dish. It was a hit with all 6 members of my family and that is no easy task!",

Because we enjoy the taste of sauteed onions I chopped rather than minced. I melted the cream cheese with the meat and onion mixture to make sure the cream cheese completely melted. This worked well for me and then I added the mixture to the pasta and sauce mixture. I split the casserole in to 2 dishes and shared one with my parents. They enjoyed this dish too.",
