I didn't measure) and lots of grated parmesan cheese. This would make a great side dish for any meat seafood or fish. We actually preferred this room temp as opposed to hot. I think next time I will add some red pepper flakes for a little spice. All in all this was very good and I will def be making it again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

These sauces are not for the faint-hearted. This definitely needs to be seasoned with more olive oil (should be a little shiny, not dry). The nice thing about an olio e aglio sauce is that you can add different herbs (fresh basil, parsley and pine nuts make it \"pesto\"; hot pepper flakes, oregano and parsey make it \"puttanesca\", etc. Olio and aglio sauces are not traditionally served with parmesan cheese, nor are fish sauces. Cheese is used with meat or tomato sauces, Alfredo, butter-based sauces, etc. Great recipe for summer!",

We did add parmasean to it which made it better tasting but too thick/dry. With the leftovers I threw them in a pan for a quick fry and added some almond milk to make it creamy. It cooked up the garlic to give it a very nice flavour and the zucchini still had a crunch to it. Next time I'll still marinate it but fry it up prior to adding the pasta to mellow out the strong garlic.",
