No less than 5 stars!\" I made this chili w/ only 1 lb. ground turkey (just dropped the 28 oz. can tomatoes -- on that note why did that other review say \"nice bean-less chili alternative\" when Chili Magic has beans in it?) I kept all the seasoning/spices and directions the same and I know that Chili Magic really DOES make chili magical but I like to think that Nenadd's recipe also had a bit of magic of its own b/c our bowls disappeared! I ate mine w/ cilantro cheese fritos and Sriracha but even a \"virginal\" bite was straight-up YUM. Next time I'll be making it w/ all the ingredients as originally written and if there are leftovers cool I'll either gobble them up or freeze em.",
