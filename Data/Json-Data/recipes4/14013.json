What I did was instead of 2 eggs and water, I used 1 large egg, 1/2 cup Sour Cream, and 1/4 cup soften butter.  Much easier for me to work with.  Plus I just dropped them in boiling water until the pasta was done.\n\nAlso, you can freeze them too.  Put them on a sheet in a single layer and put them in the freezer, when the outsides are frozen... into a ziplock they go!  Then when you want to use them, take out what you need and drop them in boiling water until they float.  You can freeze the sauce in a ziplock too!  Busy day?  Homemade dinner is done!",

The second time was a bit better, i used 3 Tbs. of water and 2 tsp. of oil which made it more workable. The dough needs to be rolled much thinner than a nickel though. Another reviewer said not to worry about cutting close to the filling. Don't be afraid! The dough is very thick and too much if you don't. After cooking this i advise round ravioli!\n\nThe filling is a really good mix of cheeses. I ended up using a full cup of mozzarella instead of half mozzarella and half provolone to save a bit of money.\n\nThe proportions are a little off with this recipe. I ended up with only 13 ravioli, more than half of the filling leftover and just as much sauce as filling. Advise to anyone cooking this-- double the dough! You won't be sorry.\n\nThe Pesto Alfredo sauce is really good! Too much oil though. Next time i cook this i will cut out the olive oil and cook the garlic alone with the basil pesto sauce.\n\nLastly, the egg wash. I didn't see the point in brushing an egg wash over the ravioli before sticking them in boiling water, so i cut it altogether.\n\nAgain, overall the recipe is good! VERY time consuming for one person. I would make it again, however, with the changes i mentioned above and probably a different dough.",

I didn't have provolone so I used Parmesan. Luckily I served the raviolis with red pepper and spinach Alfredo sauce and that gave them the oomph they needed. I won't use this filling again. Oh I used a 12X 4 inch ravioli press and there's enough filling for 48 raviolis.",
