It would have been better if it were breaded with Italian bread crumbs. I used rotini instead of spaghetti. I think the recipe needs double the amount of pizza sauce mostly to cover the chicken. Also the sauce/water combo wasn't enough to cover the noodles so part if it came out hard. It needed more cheese too. I added mushrooms since I love mushroom pizza and it gave it some nice flavor. I'd make this again but with the changes I mentioned.",

I thought since you used wheat rigatoni pasta that it would be OK for me to use my Trader Joe's pasta. I also used TJ's Traditional Marinara Sauce. Since this was just for the two of us I pared down the recipe for 2 servings. But then I goofed and put all the required sauce on the bottom with the uncooked pasta. That meant that I needed to add more for the top layer. But no problem! It all worked out well. Delicious! Not free of calories but certainly free of required work to fix dinner! Thanks for making us happy campers!",

I also added mushrooms with the pizza toppings and used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts to have smaller pieces. However the chicken didn't cook underneath everything else so I had to pull them out and cook them separately on a baking sheet for an extra 8 minutes before adding it back to the pasta. The chicken was a bit bland even though I added small amounts of salt pepper basil and parsley. I will attempt this recipe again and probably keep the chicken separate when it cooks as well as add more seasoning.",

If I would do this again I would add green pepper cut the breasts into chunks or slices and use a short pasta or break up the spaghetti. Because it tastes like a pizza I'm sure would appeal to the younger crowd. I also thought that the amount of spaghetti seemed to be a bit too much (I added more sauce after seeing that from someone else) and think the whole pound of pepperoni is too much. I added a bit less than 3/4 lb and that was fine.",
