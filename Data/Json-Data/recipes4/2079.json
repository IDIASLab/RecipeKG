Here's what I did a bit differently:  we were serving 6 guests so cut the whole pork roast in half but used the full recipe for the stuffing.  Timing was perfect but did take out of the oven  at 150 as I figured it would still cook.    Moist, tender and perfect.  The Port Wine gravy was delicious.  Served with pureee of Sweet potatoes and roasted onions with balsamic vinegar and it was a wonderful accompaniment.  Be sure the meat therm. is placed into the pork and NOT the dressing.  Although the recipe said to baste with the pan dripping, there were none -- only burnt pieces on the cookie sheet.   As the pork was setting, I added the   juices from the pork  to the gravy.  Do try -- it got rave reviews from our guests but be careful not to overcook as a friend did.  Take it out at 150 to rest!  I will definitely make this over and over again.  Cheap, delicious meal!  For those who  wish to cook at 350, I think the very slow cooking time is what gives it the flavor and tenderness.  The timing really does work as boosting the  temperature up to 400 makes it nice and brown and taking  it out of the oven at 150 is perfect as it sets for a while.",

The sauce with port wine was gone before I knew what happened. I took the roast to an internal temp. of 155 and it needed another 10 minutes in the oven; roast was moist and everyone loved it.  UPDATE: Since my first review I have now doubled the gravy/sauce because everyone loves it.  Also, 1/2 way through the cooking I added some chicken stock to the pan so the drippings did not burn or stick to the pan; this made it very easy to scrape the pan for the gravy.",

I broiled it at the end for a few minutes.  Perfect presentation & texture.  I used the same amount of ingredients from the original recipe (8lbs pork loin) & doubled the sauce at the end.  Way more than enough for two people.  Plenty of leftovers, which we plan to have tonight :)  Definately give this a try.\n\nA good trick - add some chicken stock to the bottom of the pan every twenty minutes or so & stir w/the drippings.  It'll keep the bits from burning & you'll have plenty of \"drippings\" to make the sauce.  Great when you want to double the sauce.  Also, baste the roast each time you add the stock.  It keeps it moist and flavorful :)",

The only change I would suggest is instead of using whole garlic cloves to stuff it with, coarsely chop the garlic before cooking it in the olive oil, until soft.  Then, use the smaller pieces to stuff the loin along with the apricots (also coarsely chopped) and cranberries.  The pan sauce is amazing with the pork, and especially good on roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  This was yummy, my entire family raved about it!!",

It was also not difficult to prepare especially for what I would call a \"special occasion\" dish. My only complaint is that the temperature and cook time did not seem to make sense. 250 degrees seemed really low to me as I have always roasted a tenderloin at 350 before but I decided to follow the recipe to the T at least the first time around. I scaled the recipe for a 2.5 pound roast- I plan to make the full scale 8 pound version for Christmas but wanted to do a trial run and I'm glad I did! Anyhow just as I suspected the roast was nowhere near done when I went to check it and baste it as the recipe calls for. In fact it was barely browned on the bottom while the rest was still raw. At that point I increased the temperature to 350 for the rest of the time and it turned out fine. I am not sure if it matters that I used a smaller roast. Other than that it was absolutely delish different and impressive looking! YUM! Thanks!",
