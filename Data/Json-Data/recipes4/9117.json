Kids would have a lot of fun making these gems using their favorite toppings. The Ball Park buns are the bomb! They re so fresh and have great flavor for a packaged bun.

I followed the recipe almost exactly - my only change was I used brat buns (they are a little bigger) and I omitted the optional oregano leaves. Everything else was included and made it absolutely delicious. I'd have never thought to use buns this way but my husband asked that I please do it again soon. Definitely!

The sauce was good but it's not my fave so I'd probably just stick to my own concoction next time. I also used my own toppings. I chopped up one slice of bacon and saut\u00e9ed it until crisp. Then I sliced one large mushroom and saut\u00e9ed it in the bacon grease until pretty soft. Then I saut\u00e9ed some sliced onion in the same pan. I transferred all of the toppings into small individual containers so my son could make his own! He loved it. He made a captain pirate with a bacon mustache! Lol! I definitely will be making these again to use up buns. Quick easy and of course yummy too!",
