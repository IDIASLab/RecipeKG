I made very few changes based on comments by other reviewers - I used minced garlic instead of powder, basil instead of parsley, and I added a scant 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes.  I also sauteed the onion and garlic before adding.  Stuffing the uncooked shells eliminated my normal irritation with making manicotti (which is the fragility of the shells).  This pleased both my husband and my two kids, and pleased the most critical of us - me.  I loved loved loved that I was able to make it in the morning and just pop it in the oven at dinnertime.  It made for a very fuss-free evening, and that in itself is worth lots of stars!  Lucky for me it was yummy, too.",

I have tried both ways, pre-cooking the noodles, and adding water to the uncooked version of the recipe. I prefer adding the water, the shells are so much easier to stuff when uncooked. I usually freeze half of the recipe. So easy to just pop in oven next time around. It does not change the taste, etc. of the \"sauce\" by adding the water. The water is absorbed during the cooking process. Add garlic/cheese bread a salad and glass of wine for a true authenic \"Italian Dinner.\" I totally recommend this recipe~~~~ AAAA++++",

I have never made this before but it is something I always order when I'm out, and after the changes I made it ended up being better then any I have had at a restaurant so far. So, I first of all started with a bag of fresh baby spinach, sauteed it in my wok with a tablespoon of olive oil, garlic, and the onion. I used fresh minced garlic. After letting that saute for a few minutes I added 2 tablespoon of fresh sweet basil from my garden instead of parsley, also added dried basil, oregano,garlic powder, parsley and Italian spice all which were eye-balled amounts(Maybe about a tablespoonish of each.) Also plenty of pepper, and a few dashes of salt. I let saute for a couple more minutes then set aside to let cool so the cheese wouldn't melt when it was mixed together. When cooled I mixed it with the ricotta, parmesan, mozza and the egg. Stuffed in to uncooked manicotti noodles and made sauce like recipe called for. Baked at 375 for an hour. Amazing. Everyone who ate it gave it rave reviews and are already asking when it will be made again. Hope this helps!",
