It took 10 minutes for the pressure to build cooked for 8 minutes then 17 minutes for natural release. I used one of those apple peeler/corer/slicers which slice the apples quite thin so I didn't need to blend the sauce at all just a good stir with a wooden spoon did it for me. The 3 tbsp of water was just right. It's the perfect amount of sweetness and spiciness and I didn't add any salt. I will be buying great big bags of apples just to use for this recipe.

I had to nearly TRIPLE the amount of maple syrup before I even started to taste anything close to a maple flavor. Again without the adding of the extra flavor the sauce tasted very good but if you truly want maple flavor in your applesauce you will need to add much more than the recipe calls for. Not sure if using maple extract would help but just something I thought of after the fact.",
