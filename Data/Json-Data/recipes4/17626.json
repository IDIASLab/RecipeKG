I skipped the pepper flakes and it was still a tad spicy for my 7yr old so I'll tame down the chili powder next time as well. I always use plain Greek yogurt for sour cream and you'd never know the difference. I recommend fat free refried beans and ground turkey instead of beef. My husband even commented he really liked it and he doesn't usually like refried beans. This made 8 good size burritos, not 4. If you did 4, they would be HUGE.",
