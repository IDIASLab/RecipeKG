I added carrots and potatoes and a pkg of onion soup mix along with salt, pepper, Accent, garlic powder, and thyme, which I think it definitely needed. The meat came out very tender and the broth was excellent (I thickened it a little at the end with instant potato flakes).  I will be using this recipe for stew from now on.  Thanks!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was awful!  First off, the stew meat should be browned first so the juices stay inside the meat.  Without browning, the juices escape and mingle with the other liquids and create a very unappetizing pinkish foam on top of the stew.  It also makes the meat drier than if it was browned first.  Second, the stew liquid is way too thin.  It needs cornstarch or some other thickener otherwise it is like soup.  Also, it makes a very light creamy colored stew instead of a richer brown color typically associated with stew.  Thirdly, I used condensed Onion Soup (campbells) because I couldn't find French Onion soup.  It wasn't that good but maybe the French onion soup would be better.   Don't waste your time or money on this recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "Okay, as the recipe reads it is a good beef stew if you want basic beef stew and have 5 minutes to prep--and some days, that's just fine.  Here are my adjustments to kick it up a notch or two (and these add about 10-15 minutes of prep time):  1.  Brown the beef in a non-stick skillet on medium-high heat.  2.  While the beef is browning, cut up 3-4 carrots and place in bottom of slow cooker.  3.  When beef is browned well, pour the 1/2 cup of red wine into the skillet to deglaze it; cook a few minutes to reduce (makes a lovely dark brown gravy).  Pour beef and gravy into slow cooker.  4. Put the pan back on the burner and add 8-16 oz. sliced fresh mushrooms (subbing these for the canned mushrooms; I like baby bellas, but any mushroom is fine).  5.  While the mushrooms saute, pour 1 envelope of dried onion soup mix over the beef.  Add the can of French onion soup and 1 can of GOLDEN MUSHROOM soup (subbing this for the cream of mushroom soup).  Add garlic powder to your preference.  6. When the mushrooms are slightly browned, add another glug of the red wine to the pan.  Continue cooking another minute or two more to reduce wine; pour mushrooms and cooking liquid into slow cooker.  7.  Cook as stated; serve over buttered noodles.  For an extra 10-15 minutes, you can have a more flavorful, richer-colored beef stew.  However, on days when you have 5 minutes or less, the original recipe is just fine.",

For 1.25lb of stew beef I used one full can each of Campbell's French Onion and Cream of Mushroom Soup and 1 full cup of merlot red wine. Also per another poster's suggestion I added garlic powder and thyme to taste and a healthy dash of fresh black pepper. About 2 1/2 hours before I was anticipating it would be finished I added about 5 quartered baby red potatoes and a dash of parsley flakes. I served it over wide egg noodles and with buttered baby carrots on the side. My fiance loved it! He had 2 full helpings as did I. I found the meat to be quite tender and flaky and there was plenty enough 'gravy' to counteract any dryness the meat might've had. I personally can't even stand the scent of mushrooms and was apprehensive about using the soup in this recipe but it definitely turned out for the best. Thanks Cheryl! I will definitely make this again!",
