I used green pepper but also yellow red and purple. Each has it's own flavor so it brings an incredible blend to the salsa. Also I didn't use pickled jalapenos. I used fresh. It had some kick that's for sure! I used apple cider vinegar instead of red wine. AND I added more cilantro (it's one of my favorites). That's the glory of salsa......it's an empty canvas waiting for an explosion of taste and color!!! My mother in law (who is Mexican and can make INCREDIBLE salsa) was even impressed - a rarity:-) I will refer to this recipe in the future but I recommend using this as a springboard for creativity!",

I added 2 bay leaves 3 cloves crushed garlic 1 tsp ground corriander 1 tsp ground cumin 1 habanero pepper instead of the jalapenos and more salt to taste. I omitted the cilantro as my fruit and veg store was out but I would normally use it. The one habanero is plenty to make this quite hot. Will maybe use 2 next time to make it extra hot.",

We also added 2 garlic cloves (how can you make salsa with no garlic?!) and fresh jalepeno instead of pickled. We used one fresh but two would have been better. We served the salsa over homeade pita chips (cut pitas into six wedges with a pizza cutter then separate and brush with oil salt pepper and garlic powder and bake at 450 until browned). Incredible meal!",
