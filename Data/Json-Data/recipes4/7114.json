My seasoning choices are salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. My barbecue sauce choice is Sweet Baby Ray's&reg;. Just put it in a slow cooker before you go to bed and when you wake up the magic has happened. See for yourself. This recipe is perfect for a party, and you can even prepare 2 and feed around 30 people. Serve on onion or hamburger buns.",

I put the juices into a fat separator, then put them into a separate pan on the stove (on low), and mix in 1/2 the bottle of BBQ sauce. That made for a richer taste that isn't overpowered by BBQ sauce.\nAlso, when you return the meat to the slow cooker and mix the juice/sauce mix back in, no reason to cook it for another hour. Just heat it through if it cooled down during the shredding process.",

Used a pork shoulder because that all the grocery store had. Doubled the spices listed, plus added 2 tsp of hot paprika and 1/2 tsp of cayenne. I put half of an onion sliced in the bottom of the crock pot with some sliced garlic, put the pork fat side down on top of the onion/garlic, rubbed the three sides of the pork with the spices, poured in the beer and threw in a few drops of liquid smoke. Went to bed and when I woke up, I had the most delicious pork I've ever made. Easiest thing I've made in a very long time! Used Stubbs Original sauce on the half that got sauce, but with the pumped up spices, the pork without sauce makes amazing tacos :)",

The only thing I will say is the meat itself really had no flavor before you put the sauce on it.  I would have liked it to have a little something on its own with out the sauce.  After cooking in the sauce, it tasted wonderful.  I would recommend adding liquid smoke, brown sugar, or cola to the mix to give it a little more dimension.",

But this time I happened to have some pork shoulder in freezer, it was snowy winter day and comfort food was calling my name. This pulled pork was almost as good as my brother in law's BBQ pork which he makes using outdoor smoker. Well, let me tell you - I was very proud of my pulled pork it was delicious! I didn't have any onion powder so just omitted it, used Kraft's BBQ sauce and added a little of BBQ seasoning. Next time I would probably add some liquid smoke just to add that smokiness to the flavor. Otherwise - thanks to the author for the great recipe and I highly recommend it!",

I made it exactly as described except I used a gluten free beer (Redbridge) and omitted the salt because of dietary restrictions. The butt was 5.5 lbs and required 12 hours on low. I turned it once after 7 or 8 hours. It was so tender that I had to remove it from the slow cooker in pieces with a spatula. I cooked the meat (carefully trimmed of any remaining fat or membranes and then pulled with two forks) with 12 oz. of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce as described. I left it on low in the crockpot for 2-3 hours instead of the recommended one hour and some of the sauce caramelized on the side of the crock. It would probably be better to stick to one hour or to stir the meat and sauce occationally. The result was superb. I've made pulled pork dozens of times following several different recipes and this recipe is far and away the best. It was even a pretty good antidote for the pain we experienced as we watched Ohio State beat up on the Crimson Tide.",
