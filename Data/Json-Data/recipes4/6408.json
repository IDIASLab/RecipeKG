My only change was to grill the chicken and pineapple separately to assure the correct amount of doneness. I will place this recipe in 3 places in my RB because I don't want to forget about it. It will go in the poultry folder the salad folder AND the sauce and marinade folder! Thanks for the idea.",

I used dried rosemary instead of fresh, and accidentally measured too much, and it was still fine.  Didn't have pine nuts, so substituted sunflowers seeds because it definitely needed something crunchy.  Amazing combination of flavors and textures.   Use fresh pineapple.",
