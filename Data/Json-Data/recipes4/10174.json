She then turn the raw side down on a cooling rack set over another oven element that is set to high. If the first side is done properly the roti fully inflates on the wire rack set over the heat.",

Divide into balls sprinkle counter with  flour.  Take care when making balls, turn the edges under and when you roll out don't put any wrinkles in it as it will effect the final outcome in the oven.  If there are no wrinkles it will puff right up, if there are wrinkles, they won't puff up.  Turn pan onto med high heat and oven at 450 degrees , when the edges start to turn up, flip and do the same to other side.  When second side edges have turned up take out of pan and place in oven, turn on the oven light and watch the show.  It's incredible, it puffs up into a big ball of air..  30 seconds later remove from oven and pat down to let the air escape and butter it.  These are used to scoop your curry meats and basmati rice.  Excellent.  The nex day, I like to take a left over Roti and cold curry chicken and sauce over some rice and roll up.  So Good.",

At this point use a spatula or a folded towel to lightly press around the edges to let it rise and its ready. Make sure the dough is soft not sticky or dry. Oil/salt or just plain doesn't matter.
