I was looking for a recipe for the purpose of using up some of the HOT sausage when I came across this one. I changed it quite a bit but it's still very similar and indeed excellent - I had two servings myself and so did my husband! I used about a pound and a half of \"hot\" (spicy) deer sausage the onion green pepper tomato soup and water but to please my picky husband I left out the garbanzo beans and the rice. Instead I used a regular size can of plain baked beans and a 22 oz. can of Bush's Grillin' Beans - Smokehouse Tradition. I also added about a half cup of ketchup since I have tons of bottles I'm trying to get rid of and also to hopefully cool the spicky sausage down a bit. I did not need to add any barbecue saucee because the Grillin' beans had a Sweet & Smoky sauce already. The results were excellent (and spicy but not too much so). I found a way to use up some of this deer meat I have. Thank you very much!",
