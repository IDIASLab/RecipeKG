In 1/2 cup of oil, my filling was swimming in the oil. I ended up pouring out most of the oil after my shrimp had cooked but before I added the eggs.  Also, because we had our little ones eating with us, I omitted the chile in step 2 and after I cooked the kids parathas, I added some cayenne pepper in the filling for hubby and I.  It was really, really good.  Thanks!!",
