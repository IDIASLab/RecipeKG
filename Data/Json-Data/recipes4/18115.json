I've never eaten sprouted lentils but found that they are fresh crisp and enjoyable. It took a few days to sprout them but it is worth the time and effort. The dish is not as labor-intensive as it reads. Everything flows perfectly. While the dish is warming in the oven you're effortlessly doing the next step. The lentils lose some of their volume so even though at the beginning it seems it won't all fit in the pan don't worry it will. I used shredded chicken instead of diced and added a very generous amount of hot peppers. Thank you for this unique recipe.",
