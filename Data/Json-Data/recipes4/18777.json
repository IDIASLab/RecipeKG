I cut that ingredient to only 1 tsp.  Even then, it was very hot.  If I had prepared that as written, it would have been inedible.\n\nAlso, you want us to use grape tomatoes and 1/4 cup of crushed tomatoes.  Who is going to really open up a can of crushed tomatoes for 1/4 cup?  No one who is experienced in the kitchen would do that.\n\nIn the old days, women's magazines would test all recipes a minimum of two times before publishing to see if it works.  Instead, we are the beta testers, and unpaid at this.",
