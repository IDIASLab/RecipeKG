I used applesauce instead of juice, added a pinch of nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon, added blueberries (at the time I added oats to the pot), and used vanilla hemp milk instead of dairy milk. I also added a Tbsp. of ground flaxseed after putting it in my bowl, and sprinkled with walnuts. SO GOOD! (Now that I think about it, I guess I made a lot of changes to the original recipe, but it was a great starting off point & just delicious!) :)",

Also i do recommend you add some sort of sweetening agent I popped in 1/4 cup of brown sugar and at the end I put in as much milk as I thought i needed - just eye it.",

The first time I made it without the apples and added apple sauce instead of apple juice (I like a thick oatmeal not runny so less juice sounded good). The recipe was alright not very flavorful, and very runny. The second time I made the recipe and followed it to a T. I didn't like it though, I found it bland and it tasted more like cinnamon soup than oatmeal. Despite my disappointment and failed attempts in making an apple cinnamon oatmeal recipe that actually tasted good on a cold fall morning.\r\n\r\nNot ready to given to defeat I pioneered into my kitchen this morning to try one more time. I found success!! Well, there are still some more tweaks but it is far better and more flavorful. Not mention it actually tasted like a hardy oatmeal instead of oatmeal cinnamon soup. Instead of apple juice I used apple sauce, I used a granny apple (delicious)! I used 1 & 1/4 cup rolled oats. Added two teaspoons ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. ground ginger, 1 pinch cloves, 1 pinch nutmeg, and 1 cup milk. I added the milk at the end of cooking to let it warm up and sweeten the oatmeal. I also added 1/4 cup brown sugar while cooking the apples. \r\n\r\nThis recipe is much better and far more flavorful. Very spicey but I love that in my oatmeal. It hit the spot on a cold fall morning.",

I added a generous dash (just less than 1/8 tsp)of salt to the water. Since I was using quick cooking oats I let the apples cook in the liquid for 2 minutes before adding the quick oats and continued to cook for one more minute. I like my oatmeal on the sweet side so I sprinkled sugar over it before eating. I would probably make this again but with the changes.",
