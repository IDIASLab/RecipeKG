This recipe turned out so good I literally could have poured myself a mug and just drink it! DELICIOUS! Made as written just seasoned the chicken and veggies with Sazon Complete before putting them into the oven. Something you must ALWAYS do when making broth/ stock is to ROAST THE BONES AND THE VEGGIES FIRST It takes it to a whole other level. I thought it made a huge difference when I started making it that way on the stovetop. In the IP It's even better. What else can I say? Oh from now on THIS will be my recipe when making broth/ stock. It really is the best! THANK you for this recipe!",

I omitted the salt as I like to freeze the stock in 2-4 cup containers/jars for a variety of uses in cooking. The only change I would make is to omit the tomato as I think it caused a sweeter flavor to the broth which was still good but not what I'm used to with chicken broths. Next time I may add a bay leaf and some fresh sprigs of herbs if I have it on hand. Used this broth when making Lemon Asparagus Risotto which worked out perfectly! Thanks for the recipe!",
