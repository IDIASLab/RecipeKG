Made this dip last night for Monday Night Football and while we did not enjoy the game (we are Eagles Fans) we absolutely LOVED this dip!  I halved the recipe since it was just me and my husband, and it is the perfect size for a little dipper crock pot.  this was SOOOOOO easy!!  I just got some corned beef from the store deli and tore it in strips.  Also brought the cream cheese to room temp. before putting it in.  Put the crockpot on low for about 1 and 1/2 hours and that was perfect, everything had melted and was creamy.  I served this with cocktail rye as suggested, but we actually enjoyed it more on tortilla chips!  This is going to be my staple appetizer to bring to parties b/c it is extremely easy and delicious!  Thanks for the recipe Ella!",

Instead of swiss cheese, I used a shredded mix of mozzarella & smoked provolone (Sargento brand) and added about 2 teaspons more of the Thousand Island dressing.  I also doubled the recipe.  If you do this, you'll have to cook it a little longer -- approx. 1 hour on high.  Then, keep it on low until ready to serve.\n\nThis is a very easy recipe and fairly inexpensive (especially if you use the Buddig brand of corned beef).  For special occasions & to reduce additives,  I will probably use fresh corn beef from the deli.",
