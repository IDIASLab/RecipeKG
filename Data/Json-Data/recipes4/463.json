If you sift a little bit of cornstarch into your shredded cheese, and squeeze some fresh lemon juice into the sauce while you are adding your cheese, it will become nice and creamy. We love this recipe, but we also change it a little by adding freshly minced garlic and some asiago along with the romano and parmesan. This stuff is so good we dip our bread into it!",

I minced some garlic and saut\u00e9ed it in the butter on low heat before adding the cream. TIP: if you're concerned the sauce is too soupy, just continue to slowly stir the sauce (for about ten minutes) on low heat after adding the cheese - it will thicken up to perfection. Before adding the sauce to the pasta (along with scallops, shrimp and broccoli) I was a bit concerned about the flavor. I had tasted the sauce from the pan and it was much too salty. I had only added a dash of garlic salt and a dash of table salt, so I couldn't figure what I might have done wrong. My only thought was that I neglected to use unsalted butter, but the recipe hadn't specified. Anyhow, once combined with the pasta, etc., the sauce tasted perfect. I'm sure much of the salty flavor was a result of the cheese, but you can't go wrong with Romano and Parmesan. Next time I will mince/saut\u00e9 a bit more garlic and I will hold off on the garlic/table salt. I adjusted the servings to feed 12 people, which required 4 sticks of butter. Maybe next time I'll use 2 unsalted and 2 salted sticks, but as I said, once combined with the pasta, the sauce tasted wonderful.",

Best thing besides taste is that this recipe has no egg in it!\r\n\r\nGood even without the parmesean added at the end.\r\n\r\nIf you have leftovers and the butter separates, add more cream before heating and stir after heating - it will be just like when it was fresh. \r\n\r\nBe careful of this stuff though - sauce is extremely fattening!!!

Remember to reserve at least a 1/2 cup of your pasta water to thin the sauce before serving, it thickens rapidly.",
