However, I have not been able to find ground chicken in my grocery store, so I made this recipe with ground turkey instead.  It was fabulous!  In addition, I do not have a grill, so I put about 1/4 cup of veggie oil in a skillet and cook the burgers on each side for about 4 minutes until they are golden brown.  Then, I drain the burgers on paper towels and serve them with cheese on top.  The veggies give the burger excellent flavor and add a lot of moisture.  Very yummy and easy to make!!",

Both a little on the BLAH side but these burgers are outstanding.  I've never heard or seen 'old bay seasoning' (i'm from Canada) but i know the stuff is in everything on this site.  A little research yielded some helpful advice (luv google).  A little celery seed, mustard seed, bay leaf, paprika, pepper...and some more things i can't quite recall. Anyhow, absolutely deee-licious and the burgers maintained a nice firm round shape throughout the entire process.  Served on whole wheat buns with a little ranch dressing and lettuce.

Not to be deterred however I placed the mixture into a pre-greased loaf pan and made chickenloaf instead baking at 350 for 30 minutes. It tasted pretty good (I admit I too was doubtful about the carrots) so it all worked out in the end. This recipe DID encourage me to look for (and successfully find) Old Bay seasoning which I admit I had never heard of as someone raised and still living in the midwest so I have a new staple in my spice collection. I might make this as a loaf again in the future if I have a taste for it. Thank you Teri!",
