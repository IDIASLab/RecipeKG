The filling has tons of flavor but the end result is a little dry due to the fact that you can only put 2 tablespoons of it in each tortilla so that you still have room to roll. I also prefer the flavor of corn tortilla's over flour and I might try that next time even though I know corn will be a bit of a challenge to roll. If you love jalapeno poppers then this one is a must try!",
