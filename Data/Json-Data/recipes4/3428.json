Followed almost exactly; with the exception of omitting the sour cream as I was out but adding 1/4 cup more milk. Was plenty creamy though with the milk and cream soup. Also used thyme as I don't care for rosemary. And finally I chopped up fresh spinach for a healthier bite and some color! This was a great casserole for a healthy and unique choice. WILL CERTAINLY MAKE AGAIN!!!",

After going over the ingredient list and the directions, I decided to give it a whirl.  Guess what??  IT WAS AWESOME!!  The prep stuff and cooking process was easy as can be.  The hardest part was waiting for it to be finished so we could scarf it up!! The only thing that I will change the next time I make this (and I can guarantee you that I will definitely make this recipe again) is to sweat out the onions out for just a few minutes in a saute pan before adding them into the casserole mixture, as we found the onions to be a bit strong as they were listed in this recipe.  Otherwise, it is pure casserole perfection!!  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with the universe!!",

                "reviewBody": "We just aren't fans of the  taste of canned soups. So I made a very basic cream soup using chicken stock, leaving it on the thick side, so as not to thin it out too much when the sour cream was added. I eliminated the milk, as it was in the cream soup I had made. I cut up boneless pork loin, removing all the fat. After browning off the meat, I then carmelized the onions. This eliminated the slight crunchiness that can result from onions in a casserole that have not been precooked, which can be off-putting to many. Additionally, caramelizing them lends a powerhouse of depth to the flavor of almost any dish. It was delicious - comfort food on steroids!  Cheesy, starchy, stick-to-your-ribs goodness. Eliminated the corn, as we had it last night. It's not a deal-breaker; I'll add it the next time. The fresh rosemary was lovely, and complemented the pork. To sum it up,  the recipe has many good things going for it, but replacing the canned soup with something made fresh, as well as carmelizing the onions both represent a huge advance in flavor. As is, it's a respectable, if unexciting option when pressed for time. Could only give it a 5 if it needed no tinkering, which we felt this did, in order to make it great.",

My pork was leftovers I made Cream of Anything Soup a personal recipe from AR mine happened to be Cream of Pepper Soup using green and yellow peppers as we do not care for mushrooms corn that I had froze rather than canned and Pepper Jack Cheese as I was out of Cheddar cheese. This came together quickly since my pork was already cooked. I just mixed up everything in the pan that I boiled the pierogies in and poured it in a casserole dish. This was hot and delicious in 35 minutes. I did let it rest for about 8 minutes before serving to let the cheese and soup set up just a little. I served this with Coleslaw with Grapes and Spinach from AR and we had a wonderful dinner. DH & DS already called dibs on the leftovers. Thanks 3Scorpios for sharing this recipe. We love pierogies and I m always looking for new ways to fix/serve them.",
