The result is the same thing you'd get with 8+ hours of conventional simmering. This is a great way to use a leftover chicken carcass from dinner the night before, even if it's one of those rotisserie chickens from the store! I like to season the stock at the end, so that you can accurately control the amount of salt.",

Suggestion for freezing - - after it has cooled, gather several small plastic containers. Measure out 1 cup of stock into each container and place them in the freezer. The next day after they have all frozen, pop the the frozen \"puck\" out of the plastic container and put them all into a ziploc freezer bag. So when you need chicken stock you just grab as many \"cups\" as you need out of the plastic bag that is in the freezer! Using this method has encouraged me to use chicken stock in place of water for cooking veggies etc, because its so convenient to just grab one out of the freezer!",

It's cost effective and energy effective.  And the food that comes out of that pressure cooker - words cannot discribe.

There's an extra flavor when uasing them.  I also chop the veggies a little smaller & sautee them for more flavor & throw in the skin.  Good flavor there too.  Worried about fat?  You can always skim  broth when it's cooled.  I do remove any meat from the carcass before cooking & save it for later use.  I recently bought a 71/2 qt. electric pressure cooker from wolfgang\r\n& it's great.  It's a no brainer!",
