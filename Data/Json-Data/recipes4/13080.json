I sauteed 1 C of dry rice, onion, and garlic in hot oil and then added about 1/2 tsp annatto powder, 1/4 tsp paprika, a little chicken bouillon, and 1/2 tsp cumin. Then I added 2 C water and 1/4 c frozen peas. I brought it to a boil, turned heat to low, then covered and cooked 20 mins. I removed the rice from the heat and left covered for 5 mins. Then I fluffed with a fork. PERFECT! I served this with Salsa Chicken (also from this site) for an easy weeknight meal.  This was a great way to use my annatto powder.",

Long grain rice can be tricky sometimes. That's the proportion that usually works out for me.",

                "reviewBody": "Having lived in Miami and eaten and cooked delicious Cuban food for over 25 years, I understand the \"bland\" reviews. First the water to rice ratio is too much. Try cutting down to 1 1/2 cups of water for each cup of rice. Secondly, because the spice and onion were not made into a sofrito (sauted in a little oil with diced garlic (not included in this recipe) the flavor of the spices is diluted in the water. The sofrito - onion, garlic, red or green bell pepper should be sauteed in the oil before the annato is added. When I make Cuban style yellow rice, I also add a bay leaf to the sofrito. After the veggies have softened, I add the rice to the mixture, stirring for about 2 minutes. That allows it to absorb the flavors of the spices and the yellow color from the annato. Finally, add the water, bring to boil, then lower heat and simmer for 15 - 20 minutes. Take out the bay leaf. Then add the sweet peas at the end. Stir rice before serving. Hope this helps.",

I didn't have annatto powder but a quick internet search told me that equal parts of paprika and turmeric would be a suitable substitute. Also rather than cook the onion in the water I saut\u00e9ed it briefly in a little butter before adding the rice then let that toast a bit before adding the water and finishing the cooking. Not wanting to open a jar of pimientos for the little I needed for just Hubs and me I finely chopped some red bell pepper to take its place. It added both color contrast and extra flavor. I served this with Quick and Easy Shrimp Fajitas and Cucumber-Mango Salsa both excellent recipes also from this site. Hubs and I agree we'd gladly eat this exact same meal again.",
