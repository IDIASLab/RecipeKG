I left the pork in larger chunks so i could shred. Added sea salt and pepper. My family like spicy so I added a few extra peppers and when it was done in pressure cooker i shredded it and put it is a roasting pan in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes to crisp it up a bit. Will definately make these again and again. Thanks so much for the fantastic recipe Korgilover!!!",

I'll make it per the recipe but I seriously question matching the finished product with the leading photograph. No hunk of pork smaller than the size of a football is going to retain its shape after One Hour of cooking at pressure. I see a major disconnect here and I wonder if there are typos or perhaps the 'author' has never cooked it. At normal 15 PSI pressure cooking the directed 1.5\" cubes of meat will turn to 'pulled pork about the 15-minute mark. I'd like to have pieces of meat not strings. I cannot yet rate this but I think the cooking time is a major overkill.",
