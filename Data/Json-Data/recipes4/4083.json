I also used 7 Matzo sheets instead of 6 to make sure I covered all the layers. I wish I had taken a picture because it looked so good when it came out of the oven.

It was fantastic, and everyone loved it!!  I need to use 1 1/2 pieced of matzah each level to fit a large casserole dish; this worked perfectly.  Also need more marinara sauce, about 1/2 more jar.  I will use this recipe forever!!",
