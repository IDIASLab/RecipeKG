Once they were almost cooked through, I splashed on a little bit of soy sauce and set them aside. \r\n\r\nI cooked my sliced onions in the butter, (instead of the eggs. I used PAM for those) Great flavor and gave the rice a little something too.\r\n\r\nWhen I combined all ingredients, I also added some green onion to this dish, red pepper, and red pepper flakes.\r\n\r\nAlso! *Make sure your rice is cold when you cook this!*\r\n\r\nGREAT recipe, will use again and again.

Made for a very quick and easy recipe. \r\n\r\nI do recommend that you have everything chopped and ready to add before you actually start cooking as this cooks very quickly and leaves no time in between.\r\n\r\nMy 3yo loves fried rice when we are out so this was an excellent dinner for her! And I could chop the vegis and chicken into bite sizes for her and not worry about her trying to stuff something too big into her mouth! And the rest of the family loves it just as well, even my super picky husband (who seems to never eat anythign I make! LOL)",

I made some rice then cooled it down, placed it in the refrigerator to chill. I had a lot of leftover rotisserie chicken from costco so I chopped that up in cubes. In a small bowl I beat 2 eggs with a little water and melted a little butter in a skillet. I placed the egg mixture in the pan and heated it up until the egg set. I flip it over for another minute then set it aside to cool. In the same skillet I added sesame oil, heated it up, added a half onion, chopped and minced up. I let the onions cook down a bit before adding the next ingredients. I had a red bell pepper that I diced up and I added that, then 1 garlic clove, little grated ginger, frozen peas and carrots. When the onions were almost translucent I added in the diced chicken and then rice. I broke up the chilled rice while it was heating up in the pan to combine everything. I then seasoned with black pepper, a little salt, added 1T of soy sauce and about 2T of oyster sauce to taste. I continued to stir to mix everything in well. Lastly I added in the eggs, cut up in strips and then garnished with chopped green onions. The dish was colorful and a meal in itself with the chicken meat and veggies I added to the fried rice. A perfect tasty meal that I served along with \"bacon-y bok choy\", also from this website!",
