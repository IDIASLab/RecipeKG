The issues are not enough tomato flavor, which is easily fixed my adding some tomato paste, and it needed and herb of some sort so I felt oregano would work well.  Other than that, I used red bell pepper as a preference and chopped the top and cooked it with the onion.  The directions don't say when to add the garlic, so I added it when the onions started to turn translucent. I'm not a big spicy person so I used less cayenne, and instead of mozzarella, I thought using Mexican cheese blend went better.  I liked really the outcome with these changes!",
