And felt great getting two veggies out of one.  I added butter and a bit more oil because it didn't seem like enough.  This was a mistake as my greens turned out a bit too oily/buttery.  Perfect as is.  THANKS!",

Note that the time given to bake or roast the beets is an approximation--how long you cook them in actuality depends upon the size and age of the beets, as well as the vagaries of each particular oven. When I'm using baby beets, the time is slightly less than one hour; at this time of year (fall), I'm using older. larger beets, so I'll figure this in, and cook them for up to an hour and a half.\nOh, yeah--tobasco is tasty on the cooked greens, too.",
