The kids liked them, but the oregano killed it for me. I also found the double coating tedious, time consuming and unnecessary. I\u2019m thankful for a good base recipe, but next time I\u2019ll omit the oregano, use and egg for the dip instead of the slurry and one coat it once. I also had wasted almond flour, and it\u2019s not cheap so I\u2019ll cut it to 1 1/2 cup of almond flour. I will probably use 1 1/2 tsp of each salt and pepper as well and use my convection setting for an even crispier breading.",
