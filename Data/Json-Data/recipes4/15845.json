Just add it slow and you'll be just fine. I'm not a fan of cutting the pork up into 1/2in. cubes however. I think it lets them dry out too much. When I make this again and I will I plan to use boneless pork loin. I will slice them into about 1/2in. thick pork chops and put a quick sear on them in a hot pan with oil. Next I will throw them in a casserole pan and smother them with the gravy cover it and finish it off in the oven. Overall this was a great recipe and the family really enjoyed it!",
