                "reviewBody": "Our family INHALED these! My BEST EASY TIPS ...  \n  ---1.  Cut unwrapped caramels in half/quarters for easier melting (Kraft caramels in candy aisle also come as \"bits\" like chocolate chips, same price - great result!) \n  ---2.  When toasting pecans, so do LIGHTLY, as they can scorch.\n  ---3.  Best results by starting the caramels melting a little in small saucepan first, then stirring the water and butter into it very well. Watch it ... caramel alone can easily scorch on bottom of pan, so water/butter will help. DON'T omit the water and the butter ... (at least most of the butter) ... it really keeps caramel a little bit softer when it sets up, so it isn't brittle hard and you don't break a molar!!\n  ---4.  To get BEST taste and \"feel\" of \"TURTLES\" brand candy ... 1) arrange 3 pecan halves together FLAT on the parchment/cookie sheet, ... 2) pour spoonful of melted caramel over them - it will spread a bit - put sheet in refrig to harden a bit, ... 3) melt milk chocolate pieces in a small heavy saucepan on low heat, slowly, so it doesn't scorch either, [meanwhile take candy from refrig to lose some of its chill] ... 4)slide each whole piece of candy into and out of melted chocolate [using two forks to lift and swipe excess off the bottom along edge of pan is easier], and lay back onto sheet to harden ... refrig helps here too.   The process isn't difficult, and it makes them look, taste and \"feel\" like a real \"TURTLE!\"",

I used two pecan halves per candy and instead of drizzling the chocolate I rolled the hardened pecan-caramel mix in the chocolate so it would be well-coated all around.

Second you do not mix the pecans and caramel; you need to arrange 5 pieces of pecans in a circle to imitate the legs and head of the turtle (that is why they are called turtles) I do this on a baking pan over waxed paper. After forming the ball you push them in the center of the pecans so you can imitate the shell of the turtle. After you have all your turtles arranged in the baking pan you need to refrigerate them for at least 10 minutes in the meantime melt the chocolate. Immediately after taking them out of the refrigerator coat the caramel with the melted chocolate. I always drizzle them with pecan pieces and white chocolate.",

I broke the pecan halves in half again and then toasted for about 10 minutes (watch carefully-ovens vary). I used an 11-oz. bag of caramels. I stuck my toasted pecans in the fridge while I melted the caramels (next time I will cut caramels in half to cut down on melting time). After stirring the pecans into the caramel I used 2 small spoons to drop mixture onto parchment paper; the paper plus the smaller cooled pecan pieces seemed to stop the mixture from spreading too much. Then I put the pan in the fridge while I melted milk chocolate chips. I used a decorating bag and tip to apply the chocolate over the top of each so I had more control and I like how that looks (I posted a photo). I had some leftover chocolate but that's okay; I can use it for something else. Wow! These are dangerously good! The caramel is just right even if stored in the fridge. They're going on my holiday plates and I'm sure I'll be making these again. Thanks again.",
