This is good but it's missing something. I'm not sure what it is, I'm going to make this again and play with the recipe a little.",

Next time I will do only 3 hours.  I also made sure to add the 1 T of red wine vinegar that was suppose to be listed in the recipe.  The white American cheese was so good on this!  And definitely put two slices of cheese on each sandwich because once it melts you will want extra!  Thanks for sharing a great and easy recipe!",

I guess it is just something I do naturally. With all slow cooker recipes where you are using meat - to get the most flavor sear the meat first on the stove. I do this for this recipe when I have more time but it still works and is flavorful without searing. Be careful with the salt as the stock will be salty too but do season with salt for more depth of flavor.",

I was a bit concerned about this seeing that it called for no seasoning on the meat or the veggies so I even added salt and pepper to the grilled veggies. We also used pepper jack cheese and used the leftover broth for dipping but overall the sandwiches just seemed lacking in flavor. If I were to make this again I would brown the meat first with some garlic salt and pepper and maybe even some flour and then place in crock pot. I find from making roasts in the past with tri tip that this tends to seal in the juices. Definitely found 3.5 hours was plenty of time for the meat. It was still pretty tender (not chewy thankfully) but already dry and cooked through. I think the leftovers are going to make some awesome fajitas tomorrow though!",

Lightly sprinkle (no more than 2 tsp.) of Montreal Steak seasoning as a rub before searing the meat in a 2-3 qt. pot (or use 10-inch skillet with lid). I try not use more than 1-2 tbl. of olive oil when searing. After searing, transfer meat to slow cooker. Meanwhile turn off heat to searing pot and add beef stock to soften up all the leftover meat/seasoning pieces.  Whisk in vinegar and worcester sauce then add stock mixture to slow cooker.  I added raw, sliced onions mushrooms and peppers directly on top of meat before covering and slow cooking. After 2-3 hours I removed meat to let cool before slicing and returning to slow cooker.  I grilled the sliced sandwich buns. With slotted spoon I transferred meat/veggie mixture to each open-faced bun then added the cheese (it melts on the heated meat mixture but you can also melt it in the broiler. I ladled out remaining juices (I didn't strain it) in dipping bowls to serve on the side.",

My husband accidently grabbed beef stock instead of chicken, so i put beef stock in the ingredient finder and this looked good. the beef is super easy to cook since it's in a crockpot and cooking the veggies only takes a few minutes. I don't even eat beef but had to try one of these after they came out of the oven and looked so delicious! only change i made was to use provolone cheese instead of american. Wonderful recipe, will absolutely make again!!",
