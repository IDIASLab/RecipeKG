But it's totally worth it. I made these because it's a tradition in my husband's polish family to have perogi with Christmas dinner. Some tips for handling the dough. Make sure you use really cold water adding a little at a time as you really work the dough with your hands turning and squeezing. I used just under a cup of water. I snaked it like another reviewer suggested. Kneed the dough like directed then roll it out into a long snake about 2-2&1/2 inches thick. Then with a knife make a slight indent in the center of the snake then 2 more on each side of the mark an equal distance from the ends and center and repeat. Just under half inch is about the right width to make 50 pierogi. Then cut a piece lightly flour on each side flour your rolling pin and roll out flipping the dough to create a circle. Mine were slightly smaller than 5 inches but that made for a firmer pierogi. Then continue following the recipe's directions. I ended up with half the filling left over so I plan on making another batch the day after Christmas just for us. I ate one of the pierogi's tonight (have to make sure they're good since I didn't follow the family recipe) and they're delicious! We always eat our perogi's with pan fried onions and bacon and sour cream on the side.",

My Stepdad's mom was Polish and I loved her dearly She was 101 when she passed and eating these makes me think of her & her wonderful kithchen - she made the best and this is the closest to her's.  I pretty much think its common sense to break up the meat when its going to be stuffed in dough, but thats just me :) - I find that the dough works best for me when I form a long snake shape, slice rounds from it and then flatten further into nice circles, a touch of the rolling pin and wallah! Sometimes I add a bit of seasoning to the dough too - A recipe is a guide, not a rigid unbending law - after all everyone has different tastes, stoves and probably hubbys that are picky,picky, picky! (he loves these pierogi's though) thanks silkdiver :)",
