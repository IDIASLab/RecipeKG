Then I just put in the the broiler instead of grilling.\r\n\r\nAs you can tell, I like it spicy. Even in the broiler, this recipe kept the chicken perfectly cooked and MOIST. YUMMY!!!!\r\nMy husband and 13 year old LOVED IT, and said they want this one a lot, which is great b/c it's so easy...",

I left the asparagus in the marinade for an hour and then threw it on the top grate of the grill while the chicken was cooking. Excellent!",

The only thing I would do differently is take the chicken and marinade out of the refrigerator about 45 minutes before putting the chicken on the grill.
