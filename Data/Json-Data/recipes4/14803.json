                "reviewBody": "I made some modifications and certainly, feel with those it's a 5-star.  First, I melted the butter in a large pan, then sauted onion, minced celery, grated carrot, garlic and shallot, as I think this was the main reason for the flavor, without it, I think it would be lacking.  I then added some white pepper and salt.  After the veggies softened, I added only about 2 or 2 1/2 T flour, which ended up being plenty to thicken this.  I like the idea of dry mustard, but did not have any on hand or would have added it. I whisked in the milk, slowly till well combined.  I then added in the cooked broccoli that I had cooked in vegetable stock.  I then pureed this a bit with an immersion blender.    I then added the softened (room temp) cream cheese (only used about 4 oz) and whisked that in.  I added the cheddar cheese (more like 1 1/2 cups) and stirred to melt it.  I had reserved a bit of the cooked broccoli and chopped it small, to add some texture to the soup, which was really nice.  I served this in mini bread bowl, big hit with the kids, for fun-factor!  The base idea of this recipe is really good, mostly because it does not call for process cheese food or to add a can of 'cream of something' soup, but is much more HOMEMADE.",
