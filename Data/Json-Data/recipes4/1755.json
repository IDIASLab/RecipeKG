My turkey was at room temperature when I bit into it shortly after pulling it off the stove. My bread wasn't sliced thick either. My husband complained about the mayo too much and never even realized it had salsa in it. So make sure you don't use a mild salsa. I also think I will use good old American Cheese singles to make the sandwich gooier. It has a ton of potential though and I might consider trying it again. The three stars are more that it was quite edible but needs adjustment for MY family.",

I used Miracle Whip and Old El Paso picante salsa black peppered smoked turkey and some chili powder and freeze dried chives. This had wonderful flavor. The only difficulty was eating it as I used sandwich bread and the sauce made the turkey tend to want to slip out and not stay in place while trying to eat this. What a great sandwich! Thanks!",
