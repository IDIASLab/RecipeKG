Honestly it tasted like I cleaned out my refrigerator. It needs some type of seasoning to tie everything together. It was also very oniony. I think you'd be better off omitting the edamame (which I love but which just doesn't blend here) and red peppers using red onions caramelized in coconut oil and increasing the salt. Thanks but this isn't a keeper for me.",
