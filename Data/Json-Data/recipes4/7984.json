I recommend using the Pizza Crust I recipe from Allrecipes.com for the crust. If you use canned pumpkin, make sure it is unsalted, unsweetened. I also prefer using dark meat chicken as it does not dry out in second cooking. Serve with wheat ale or light IPA beer.",

I like pumpkin so I knew it wouldn't be something that just totally disgusted me. But I must say the pumpkin didn't do anything for the pizza. I made it on Joseph's Oat Bran and Whole Wheat Lavash Bread as is my custom for a single serve pizza and then scaled down the ingredients. I tasted it first and then added salt on the top which it needed because of the unsalted pumpkin. Not bad and certainly a way to use up left-over Thanksgiving chicken and canned pumpkin.",
