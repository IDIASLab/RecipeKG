DH liked it fine too but would have rather I stopped at the fried chicken part and made a cream gravy instead and not smothered it at all. I would eat this again but seeing as my DH prefers plain fried chicken and it is already that before the additional ingredients I probably won't fix this again. It was good though:)",
