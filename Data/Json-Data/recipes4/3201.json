More important, it turns out beautifully. However, I always use an oven temperature of 400 degrees, and find it takes 15-20 minutes. I've heard of brushing the bacon with maple syrup or sprinkling on brown sugar during the last few minutes of baking, but I've never tried that. Thanks for passing this easy cooking method along to others.",

This morning I decided to try this recipe. Since it was just me (the cat had a piece too and she loved it) I only made a few pieces so I decided to make it in the toaster oven. I don't think 350 is high enough, so I did 450 for 10 minutes, then flipped it and cooked it for a few minutes more. It was perfect!! Crispy, flat and evenly cooked. Plus, cleanup was a snap (I used a sheet with edges). It was even easier to pour the bacon grease into my glass dish I save the grease in!! I don't know that I'll ever fry bacon again. One other great thing about making it this way is no odor lingers. Great recipe. Even if you're not baking for a crowd. By the way, you don't HAVE to use thick cut bacon. In fact, I used the lean Oscar Meyer Center cut. TRY THIS!!! Oh, and for a special treat sometime, when the bacon is almost done sprinkle it with a little brown sugar and a dash (just a dash) of cinnamon. This is also fantastic if you baste with just a little bit of maple syrup. Wow! Told you I'm excited about this recipe!!:))",
