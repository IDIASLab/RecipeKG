I added a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce as suggested by others and used a small jar of Marinara Sauce instead of the Tomato Soup.  It made the meatloaf richer and spicier.  I also browned the meat on top of the stove, then put it in the oven for 45 minutes uncovered.  It was delicious with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Will make it again soon.  \n\nThanks for the recipe.",
