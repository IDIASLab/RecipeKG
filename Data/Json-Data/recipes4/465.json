At first I was skeptical about making it with beer on low heat but decided to give it a try. After reading all the good and bad reviews on here I did switch some things up. Instead of using steak seasoning I used Garlic Salt, Garlic Powder, Black Pepper, and Santa Maria Seasoning (I'm not sure if every store has it. But it's easy to find in California). I put a bit of EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil) in the pan and browned the chops. I used 2/3 cup of Heineken Beer (I read someone else used it as well so I thought I'd give it a try. But my husband is a Bud Light drinker so next time I'm going to try that.), 2/3 cup of Hickory Smoked BBQ, about 1/4 cup of A1 Steak Sauce, about 2 to 3 dashes of Worcestershire's Sauce, and about 1/2 cup of brown sugar (I actually just used two handfuls, I don't really measure I eyeball a lot). I cut up some Vidalia onions and put it on top of the chops in the sauce and I just simmered on Low Heat for 2 hours. It came out perfect! Meat came right off the bones. I served it with white rice. It went great together! By the way I only cooked with 4 chops so that's why I had to reduce the quantity of ingredients.",

First of all - 2 TBLS of steak seasoning?!? Yikes - I reduced it down to a 1.5 TBLS and was still too much (but I didn't find that out until I took a bite). Second - we found the combination of beer & BBQ sauce weird (I used KC Masterpeice). Third - it smelled funny the entire time it cooked (minor complaint compared to the poor taste). Of the six chops - we barely finished 4 of them (one for each of us to choke down) and we threw the remaining two away. My daughter tried to dip them in ketchup of all things to try to make them taste better to no avail. I wouldn't say NOT to try this - it just didn't work for us...at all.

Boneless chops tend to be very dry even after simmering for a couple of hours. I was very generous with the rub (spices) and I used Montreal Steak Seasoning garlic powder a bit of paprika and a rosemary herb seasoning from pampered chef. I believe that it is very important to use good beer in this recipe. I used Guiness and it was fine but any darker beer should be good. I also used a bit of apple cider vinegar brown sugar worsteshire and one white onion. I only used between 8 & 10 oz of beer and the sauce was epic. Knock your socks off good. You can simmer this recipe for 6 hours and it wont be too long as long as the heat is extremely low.",

For all you folks worried about giving your kids beer don't be.:) Just like cooking with wine the alcohol burns off and leaves a terrific flavor. I used pork chops with the bone which is much more flavorful and tender than boneless. Like others I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce and vidalia onions. Make sure you cook as long as directed at the lowest flame - it should barely simmer else it will dry out - the longer you cook it the more tender it will be! Just keep fork-testing it. The family LOVED this! Thanks for a great addition!",
