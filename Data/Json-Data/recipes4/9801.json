First of all, try to follow the directions as they are.  If you wander off the recipe you might get a stew, onion soup, or bland goulash.  I followed the recipe to the \"T\" except for         the frozen veggies; I used fresh.  I must say I was a bit hesitant about using onion soup mix along with 1 onion; I feared a tummy ache all night...oh no' I slept very cozy and satisfied.  I baked soft rolls to complete this dinner.  My husband did prefer it a little spicier as in \"hot\" but my son LOVED it.  Which is what many reviewers' children also say.  Do not fear the onion...and by the way, this IS a soup and a very hearty one at that.   Excellent recipe!",

I use group sirloin and whole wheat pasta.  \n\nI have read a lot of reviews that comments on using 1 package of onion soup mix, or it they have used 2 it was \"too much\".  I hope that everyone realizes that the recipe calls for 1 package (1 ounce).  When I purchase dry onion soup mix, it comes in 2-2 1/2 ounce packages.  So some people may be putting in 5 ounces versus 2 ounces.  Just wanted to make note of this.  Be sure to read the package.  Thanks Marge for an easy, filling and healthy recipe!",

As I was cooking this I thought it might have too much water until I added the macaroni and of course it used up some of the liquid (I like a thick soup).  Once the macaroni was cooked it was the perfect consistency.  Could perhaps use a touch more seasoning of some sort, but overall a good stick to your ribs soup.  Will make this again.  Update:  I adapted this recipe for the slow cooker...I used 4 cans of chicken broth and no water.  Added a can of niblet corn with the juice.  Added a small can of V8 and 2 packets of low salt beef bouillon.  Everything else was the same, except for I did not add the macaroni until the end (boiled separate and added to soup so it wouldn't take up all the liquid).  It tasted really good.  I still like the original recipe because it's quicker but if you want to use your slow cooker it works good for that too.  The only thing about my slow cooker method is that next time I think I will add some water as the macaroni still sucked up the broth even though I added it at the end.",
