Had about 1 1/2 cups mashed potatoes from the previous night to which I added about 2 Tblsp. green chili sour cream, 2 Tblsp. chopped onion, the egg, a tsp. of a salt/pepper seasoning mix and about 1/2 cup flour (sorry, didn't measure exactly but added enough to make a somewhat thick (not pourable) batter) and two strips cooked bacon which I had chopped before cooking.  I used the remaining bacon grease, added a bit of cooking oil (not evoo) and about 2 Tblsp. Smart Balance to cook the cakes in.  Used a medium-size cookie scoop to measure and dropped them into the med-hot pan.  When I flipped them, I squished them down.  Will serve with more sour cream.  Have already tried them and they are DElish!  Enjoy!",

I know that's a stretch, but that's was my inspiration when I decided to serve with sausage.\n\nThe amount of oil called for is more than what you really need.  I used maybe half and got great results.  I also followed another reviewer's advice and used half green onion and half yellow onion.  Wow.  The green onion really added something special to what was already a fantastic recipe.\n\nTip:  To make the actual cakes, I used an ice cream scoop and dropped scoops into the skillet (four at a time in a regular size round skillet).  I then sprayed the back of my spatula with cooking spray and flattened them into pancake size without the potatoes sticking to the spatula.  Worked like a charm.\n\nI served with roasted chicken and spinach sausages and green beans on the side.  As others suggested, I served the cakes with sour cream.  HEAVENLY.   Thanks for the recipe.  It's a winner.",

I reserved a little of flour mixture to coat outside of cake. I found putting butter on my hands greatly helped to form cakes and keep them from sticking to my hands. I did fry them in one part butter to one part olive oil. Must admit they were pretty awesome.

                "reviewBody": "Fine as a base recipe, as I view most recipes. \nSeveral reviews post concerns about being oily and bland but I suggest that these cooks need to mod the recipe to their liking and also understand simple physics and chemistry of cooking.\n\nSolution to pancakes being too Oily: First address why you are using the oil. \nThin layer on pan to assist with non-stick: use less oil but more frequently between batches.\nThick oil = deep fry or semi-deep fry. More oil+More Heat+Small batches= more stable cooking temperature for more consistent results.\nStill oily: Your oil temp is not high enough, or you are placing too much in your pan while cooking thus resulting in the temperature of your oil dropping too much to effectively sear the outsides. To oversimplify: the concept of frying is to instantly sear the outsides of your substrate (pancake) keeping the moisture inside and the oil outside. Temp of oil for potatoes should be over 375f but should be under the smoke point of your oil - adjust temps based on your oil selection. Quantity of oil in your pan helps stabilize your temp while placing your batter in the pan.\nAlso remember that your pan also has properties that affect quality. Cast Iron and aluminum have a higher degree of heat radiation than does stainless steel (basic SS only, exceptions for multi-layered pans) meaning that SS does well to sear the outside while Cast Iron or aluminum will cook the inside to a greater degree by providing more heat above the surface of the pan.\n\nAs",
