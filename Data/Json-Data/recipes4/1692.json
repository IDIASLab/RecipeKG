Usually I am person who bakes everything from scratch but l was short on time last year and had never been to NO much less made a king cake before so I gave this a try and it was so good I made it again this year. The recipe didn't specify so I used Pillsbury orange sweet rolls because I thought it sounded more New Orleans (not that I have any idea prob it is not) and I really think the orange added to it and made it hard to tell it was from a can versus plain old cinnamon rolls though you can use them if you don't like orange. I lightly molded them together to form a ring and baked for 20-30 min. NOT 50-60. Keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn! These rolls come with their own icing which I think is plenty. For me 2 cans would be too much. The orange-flavored icing is good but because it has a pale yellow-orange color to it the food coloring for the purple is a little tricky. Last year I followed the directions on the back of the food coloring box which calls for more red than blue. Bad idea it turned out brownish. Instead stay true to this recipe and use equal amounts red and blue (I used 3 of each). Great recipe. I would not have thought of it. Thanks a lot!",

                "reviewBody": "My sister and I wanted to have a Mardi Gras party for our girls and this cake was the perfect way to make things cheap and simple. I bought 3 cans of cinnamon roll dough from the refrigerated section of the store (with the pizza doughs crescent rolls and refrigerated cookie doughs). I just unrolled the strands in each can (mine came in about 6 strands) smashed them together folded in half and rolled a little. I repeated this with each can shaped the 3 logs into a ring and smooshed those together twisted them a little bit and then baked. It only took me 25 minutes to bake so do watch the time carefully (I know my oven is a little hotter than most but I think 50-60 min. might burn for most people). I forgot to cover with foil but will do so next time. I used the icing that came with the cinnamon rolls and added food coloring to the 3 tubs of icing to make green yellow and purple. I cut a hole in the bottom of the cake stuck the baby in and filled it back up and iced over the bottom (which did make things messy!) I didn't do as neat a job as I could have but we were just having fun. Everyone raved about this cake (more so than when I bake from scratch...ahem!). The kids had a blast with it and want to make another cake again soon. I think this cake does not have to be limited to Mardi Gras--my sister said she would like to make this for a brunch (minus the food coloring and plastic baby of course!). Thanks for the great idea!",
