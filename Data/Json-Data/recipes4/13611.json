I have been making this for several months and even my two year old asks for second helpings. Two things that make this a little easier are 1) If you don't have time to let the couscous chill for an hour make it the night before and then mix it with the other ingredients the next day. 2)Either leave the cucumber out all together or cut it up and add to individual salads. I find that the leftovers don't keep as well with the cucumber mixed in.",

Also added 1 c carrots (matchstick size cut); 1 can garbanzo beans and cut back on feta cheese slightly. Excellent summer dish - added extra fresh herbs from garden - definitely a keeper recipe - thanks so much - next time going to try cooking cous cous with one can chicken broth instead of water for more flavor. The cous cous called for in recipe is equivalent to one box.",
