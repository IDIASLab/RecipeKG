The anchovies kind of dissolve into the veggie mix- you don't even know they're there (especially if like me you only use 4 oz. of anchovies instead of six). I did cut the red pepper down to one tablespoon and it was plenty spicy but not burn your mouth off. Also I recommend doubling up on the veggies because the first time I made this it felt a little scant- doubling made sure we had a hearty bite every time. Also any old noodle works well in this. Thank you so much Rachel for a dish that tastes like it came from a restaurant and takes very little time or energy to prepare!",

I used the amount called for and I didn't think it was too pungent this dish really has wonderful flavor. I didn't measure the veggies but I doubled them maybe even tripled them. As written I don't think that's enough for a pound of pasta at least not for us. Also I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and instead of adding the water I used the juice from them which was great. Be sure not to cover this at the end while simmering because it was way too soup-y and thin. Simmer uncovered for 5-10 minutes so it reduces. With a few changes this recipe is really great and I highly recommend this to anchovy lovers! Thanks for sharing:)",

The saltiness of the anchovies it's all this dish needs. I only used 4oz (instead of 6oz) because I was afraid of overpowering the dish with the anchovies flavor but that wasn't the case. I think 6oz would be just fine as well. Will make again.",

I doubled the broccoli and tomatoes and added some chopped fresh basil that I needed to use up and also subbed homemade vegetable stock for the water. The sauce was tasty but it was a little thin for me - almost broth-like. I wanted to add a pat of butter to \"finish\" it but didn't this time. Still I enjoyed this! Thanks Rachel!",
