(You know who you are)! Perfect for a potluck, generous enough for a family dinner (maybe even leftovers)! Serve with salad and crusty bread! No one will know it's not ricotta! Get crazy and experiment with other veggies in the tofu mixture like mushrooms, zucchini, peppers, swiss chard, etc. for added flavor and vitamins.",

We are new to the Vegan world so we are very selective with what we're eating. EVERYONE in this house - including my picky eater (!) ate this dish. Here's how I changed it for our family -- I doubled the garlic; used crushed tomatoes instead of chopped; omitted the bruschetta (not sure why it was suggested - didn't miss it); left out the spinach (I can't eat cooked spinach or any similar cooked leafy greens) but included it in the side salad; doubled the pesto and used \"Daiya\" brand mozzarella-style \"cheese\" (I refuse to use any other Vegan \"cheese\" as none compares). We are having a houseful of family over next weekend and have already decided this complete meal (shells salad garlic bread and homemade Vegan cupcakes) will be making a return with plenty of seconds I'm sure! A must to try. Oh and about the red sauce - so perfect that I plan to make it for any pasta dishes that call for red sauce! We lapped it up just with our bread as a snack it was so good! Thanks NJChick. You hit this one out of the ballpark. WINNER for everyone... not just Vegans =D",

Did not use sugar in the raw and used white granulated sugar instead. Used about half of the amount of sugar that the recipe called for. Cut back on the choppec tomatoes in the recipe and used more tomato sauce instead. I do not like the idea of a chunky tomato sauce with stuffed shells. So this may be a personal preference. The recipe falls apart with the stuffing. Too much onion and spinach. It just is not worth the time and effort to make. If I was to make this again I would cut back on the spinach not bother with the pesto. (had to make homemade pesto since everything in the supermarket had either parm ch or romano in it) Instead of the onion I would recommend using garlic powder instead. The directions to the recipe call for placing onion tofu spinach and pesto in a blender. Do not do this! You will end up with an unappealing green goo. I recommend blending the tofu with seasonings then adding the spinach to the tofu by hand. This recipe had 5 stars but no reviews. Usually I won't make something unless it has reviews. I decided to make it anyhow. It has potential but needs some tweeking. Overall it was a dissappointment making it for the first time.",

I prefer fresh/dried  ingredients to canned so I used fresh chopped tomatoes along with sun dried tomatoes  in the sauce. I also seasoned the sauce with garlic powder, onion salt and  italian seasoning.  I omitted the bruschetta and used agave nectar in place of sugar.  I also used cranberry pomegranate juice in place of red wine. For the filling,  I omitted the onion and added marinated artichokes.  I also used fresh baby spinach. I put the spinach and artichokes in the food processor and processed them until they would not process any more and set them aside. Then I put the tofu in the food processor and added seasoning salt, italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt free all purpose seasoning, and savory blend all purpose seasoning.\nI then folded in the tofu mixture with the spinach/artichoke mixture and also folded in the pesto.  (I think stirring it would have made it a goulish looking mess).  I used an icing spatula to insert the filling into the uncooked pasta shells and arranged then on the bed of sauce, covered them with sause and baked for 20 minutes. I then let it sit in the oven until I was ready to finish baking it for dinner.  When I was ready to finish baking it, I added a top layer of cranberry pomegranate juice on the top of the sauce and baked.",

The previous review was helpful, and I altered the recipe by seasoning the tofu in the blender and then adding the spinach.  I also omitted the onion, and used about twice as much pesto to get a smooth consistency.  Next time, I may blow off the blender and just mush all the filling ingredients up in the plastic bag.  I subbed diced tomatoes w/garlic, basil & oil for the bruschetta, cut the sugar to 1 T (and used white granulated), and used crushed tomatoes instead of the chopped.  And I cut the garlic to about 1 T, as the tomatoes also had garlic.  I did NOT boil the shells at all, and baked it about 30 minutes until they were tender (I used a stoneware baker).  After 20 minutes they were not done when poked, but the added 10 minutes did the trick, so be sure to test!  I used regular Mozzarella, since my vegan kid was not home.  The meat eaters I served it to loved it, and I did not spill the beans about what they were eating!",
