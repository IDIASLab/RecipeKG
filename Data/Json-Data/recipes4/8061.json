Forget this one - here let me hand you a recipe that will make even a Texans knees buckle (and yes, I put it to the test) : \n\n-About 2.5 lb of pork loin.  Trim off xtra fat and cut into 1.5 inches chops\n-3cans of beans of choice DO NOT DRAIN\n-6 oz tomato paste\n-16 oz of salsa of choice (I like Medium)\n-1 sm. Onion chopped coarsely\n-1  red or green pepper chopped coarsely \n-Chili powder, Cumin, Oregano and be generous, coat the meat. \n-1 chicken bullion not broth, broth makes it soupy\n-12 rings of jalapenos (optional)\n2 bay leaves (optional)\n\nThrow that in a crock  pot and an hour before its ready pull out the pork and pull it apart and give it one more hour. It will change your life.  enjoy ;)",

Even with the extra can of drained beans this was a little thin and more like a soup than a chili but that didn't matter to me. It was delish! Play around with it if you feel the need but that is just one more great thing with this recipe. It is flexible",
