However I baked in Pyrex custard cups versus ramekins for 55 minutes. For decorative purposes only I melted about 1/4 cup of chocolate morsels and made little heart designs on parchment paper allowed them to harden and then lifted off and placed on top of the cool custard. This is a really simple and easy custard - not too sweet but with the subtle taste of maple syrup. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing Linda (LMT)!
