It takes a while to make, but requires minimal work.  You can use any cut of chicken, but dark meats come out especially soft.  Serve with white rice and enjoy!",

I think it is because the soy sauce was reduced to a thick sauce and overwhelmed the flavor. There needed to be another flavor added to the soy sauce besides garlic and ginger. I will use my own favorite marinades and use this method of cooking chicken as it did turn out juicy chicken with a nice sauce.",
