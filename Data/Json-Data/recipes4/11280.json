I thought it would be great to use with some free squash that I was gifted since I have girls that flip over squash. Having said that there is too much \"cheese food\" that over powers the stuffing mix and squash from what my oldest said. She asked I make it again but with out the cheese food. She said everything gets lost in taste and the cheese stood out and nothing really else quoted from my little squash expert. In my opinion it would probably be best if the ingredients were all combined and baked rather then layering because the soup sits on the squash and onions and doesn't go anywhere. I'll make this again with tweaks and adjustments because my girls asked me to but preferably not something I'd make again as is.",

(The mandoline rocks!) I cut them up in 1 inch pieces and used about 3 cups. Sauteed the onions before adding. Also only had half the processed cheese food called for in the recipe so I put that in the middle layer then topped the casserole with smoked gouda. Also used leftover cooked stuffing for the bottom layer and did not have enough for the top cover so I just used Progresso bread crumbs. Substituted chicken broth for the water and left out the butter. Will definitely make again.",
