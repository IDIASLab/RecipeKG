I wasn't able to find tomatoes I was happy with so I instead used grape tomatoes. I also cut the radishes into smaller chunks os that you could get more of everything in each bite. I took the salad to my dad's house for a Labor Day bbq this weekend and everybody loved it! It's really flavorful and refreshing- I wasn't sure how the mint would go with everything but it really is a perfect blend of flavors. I will be making it again and again.",
