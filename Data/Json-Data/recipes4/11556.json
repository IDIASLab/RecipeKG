In the meantime, I seared the sausage with some Worcestershire sauce just to seal in the flavor, then added this to a nonstick-sprayed roasting pan and mixed in the potatoes and onions, drizzled with olive oil, and added crushed red pepper (lots if you like it spicy!), Herbes de Provence, Kosher salt, ground black pepper, garam masala, garlic powder, and one sliced red bell pepper.  I did not use any butter as called for.  In the same skillet with the sausage juices, I saut\u00e9ed the green beans with 4 cloves minced garlic and a bit of olive oil to soften.  I then added this to this mixture to the roasting pan and tossed all the ingredients together to coat.  Finally, I covered the pan with aluminum foil and baked for 40 minutes, removing the foil for the last 15 minutes, and stirring occasionally.  This was amazing!  Serve with garlic bread!",

I then add the green beans with oil and garlic on top of the sliced onions (I use 2 onions), potatoes and smoked sausage and roast in a roasting pan at 425 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes, stirring a couple of times.  I also omit the water and do not cover the pan.  I tried this method and it seemed to steam the dish and we like ours browner and caramelized.  Thanks Tonya for a very awesome dish.",

I used an even pound each of green beans, potatoes and sausage.. probably should have doubled the sausage amount, also.  The recipe seemed like it would be a good one so I made a double batch and tried one over an open fire and the other in a covered mini Weber grill.  The open fire batch I cooked for about 30-35 minutes.. some of the green beans and the potatoes were still a bit crunchy.  The other batch I left in the Weber covered for about 45 minutes.. it came out perfect; the sausage actually browned a bit and the green beans and potatoes were perfect.  I also sprinkled a pinch of Greek Seasoning overall when seasoning (just because I love that seasoning mix) and all in all I'm sure we'll have this many times more.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

Used 1 can green beans, 1 cob of fresh corn, 3 chopped garlic cloves, along with the onions and potatoes. Sliced red pepper is delicious as well. Also added some red pepper flakes and lots of pepper for some spice. i did not use any oil but rather used 1/4 can of juice from the green beans and just sprayed the top of ingredients with spray butter. so easy...throw it all in the pan and forget about it!",

I don't have a grill and hate when I'm left out of a recipe! But I've made this several times now and the perfect advice of putting this in the oven for 425 (covered so everything can steam/cook and uncovered the last 15 minutes) was perfect!  Also, there's really no need for butter OR oil because quite frankly the sausage will have plenty.  I actually used andouille sausage (found at places like randalls, carrs, fred meyer, heb) because it has cajun spices and doesn't have that disgusting processed taste of kiebalsa.  I did fry for a few minutes on a pan w/Worcestershire as suggested and it was SOOOOO worth it.  I didn't add the sausage until the last 20 min b/c I didn't want dry sausage (and it wasn't).  Sprinkling red pepper over it was also an added bonus.  Was also worried about the water being too much, but again.. was perfect amount.  I just kept poking potato w/fork until it was done (50 min. for me).",
