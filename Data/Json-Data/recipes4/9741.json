I simply put the frozen block of mussles in a skillet and heated to release the broth they were frozen in strained that liquid and reserved. Much easier! I add about a cup of carrot cut in bite sized pieces to the leek onion garlic since I had fewer mussles. Rather than whipping cream I used fat-free half & half because I had that on hand. This was a huge hit! So good relatively easy served with warmed French bread YUM! I think it's a pretty versitile recipe and you really can't go wrong with little changes. Thanks! I'll be making this A LOT!",

My change to the recipe was using coconut milk instead of heavy cream due to forgetting to buy it. I think it only aided in the flavoring of the bisque. My biggest regret is not buying a baguette to glob up all of that delicious sauce!",

I also omitted the water because I wanted it to be more like a sauce. There was still plenty of liquid. I also used 1/4 tsp curry powder because I was out of fenugreek. It didn't taste like curry. It just added to the aroma and depth of flavor. I got lovely mussels from Prince Edward Island and they were delicious. I think this should be served right away because when I went back for seconds the mussels had become a bit mushy. I can't wait to share this recipe with my family. This would also be good with a dry vermouth instead of wine.",
