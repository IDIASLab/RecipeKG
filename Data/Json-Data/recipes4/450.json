I've made this many times for groups, and it always disappears.  It's a great all-around not-too-spicy but not-too-bland chili.  If you want more heat, add some cayenne pepper or some diced pickled jalapenos.  Or just use hot salsa and hot taco sauce.  I've done several substitutions with this recipe and it's turned out well as well.  I've subbed several different kinds of beans, I've subbed a can of green chiles for the red pepper, and I've subbed tomato sauce for the spaghetti sauce.  All have turned out great.",
