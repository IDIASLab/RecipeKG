                "reviewBody": "1st of all, no one should have rated this recipe less than 4 stars.  As a professional bread baker & instructor, I find most people measure incorrectly. Remember to use Dry meas. cups for dry goods & a liquid measuring cup for liquids. Also because of the difference in the characteristics of flour, as well as variations in the atmosphere you should always use less liquid and add as needed. Soda bread is very different from any other bread you can find in the world. It's round, with a cross cut in the top, and it has a velvety texture, quite unlike yeast bread, and the most distinctive and delicious taste. Always slice paper thin, never thick, and when buttered, it is one of the best breaksfast breads, and delicious toasted. I made this recipe 3 times. 1st AS WRITTEN and it was very good. 2nd, used buttermilk, which I prefer, baked on a baking sheet, 3rd. Added 2 t. sugar, 1 c. raisins. Delicious! Gave it 5 stars because the basic recipe is good and I was able to alter to change to my liking. I preferred buttermilk, cut a X on top of bread, bake in a sheet pan, dusted with cornmeal, at 375 for 30 min., remove from oven, brush with beaten egg (for color) and baked an additional 5-8 min. Icc234, you must have measured incorrectly. Like the recommendation from a reviewer to use a fork to stir. I recommend to start with 3/4 c. milk, and add as need. I used the 1 c. of b.milk. Dust hands w/flour, LIGHTLY flour work surface.  Knead dough 5-8 times. BAKING IS A SCIENCE.",

My husband, the soda-bread expert here, had me bake it for close to 30 minutes, so it would be very crusty; and that worked well. I meant to sprinkle poppy seeds on the dough before I baked it, but I forgot; so I just coated the finished bread lightly with butter and sprinkled the seeds on then--worked fine and looked great. You don't need a cast-iron pan. I just used an aluminum pie plate with a touch of Pam, and no problem at all. Thanks for the recipe, CG!",

I made a loaf of this bread this morning.  The results were so-so.  Then it occurred to me how to improve it, so I made a second loaf tonight.  This time I used 2 cups of BREAD flour.  (We are baking bread, after all.  All-purpose flour is for cake and cookies.)  I then took the heat down to 325 and baked it for 35 to 40 minutes.  AMAZING IMPROVEMENT.  While baking, the loaf almost doubled in size; it was lighter and fluffier and tasted like real bread and was not like a dry hockey puck.  The low baking temp also gave me a flakier crust that was less than 1/8 of inch thick all the way around.  I will keep this recipe but I will use my adjustments.  I think I've almost mastered real Irish soda bread, one of the easiest bread to make.",

The first time I tried it I followed the recipe but since I did not have a cast iron pan on hand I used a tin pie plate. I left the bread in for half an hour and it was okay, but it stuck to the bottom and the middle was a bit doughy. Next time I found the cast iron pan, slightly greased it and added a half cup of grated old cheese to the flour mix. I sprinkled caraway seeds on top and waited patiently hoping for a good result. When I took the bread out after 25 minutes it was for all purposes...perfect! Wow! I would serve this to company. I am looking forward to playing around with this recipe and trying different fillings and spices. I also added 1/2 tsp. of baking powder the second time and the bread was light and the crust was crunchy and delicious. When it came out I lighty patted it with butter and it was beautiful as well as tasty. Thank you for the wonderful recipe. I figure it is going to be a staple here for this family and I am no longer going to buy those specialty breads at the supermarket. There is no need to! You can change this in a hundred ways and have a new product each time. I really recommend using the cast iron pan though. Quite a difference in the whole appearace of the bread as well as how wonderful the bottom browned! Thanks again! Love it and how easy is that!!!!!!",
