Even diluted over ice it was far too potent for me despite dumping in the WHOLE little jar of cherry juice (which I had to do to sweeten it up). I didn't try this with Irish Creme but I'm sure it would be better. I'm sorry I wasted over 1/8 of my bottle of Creme de Menthe on this. To its credit though it does cool and soothe the throat (nothing chocolate-chip mint ice cream wouldn't do) and it does have strong alcohol in it if that's what you like. The only reason I felt compelled to finish this drink though was that I didn't want to waste that much expensive liqueur by throwing it out.",
