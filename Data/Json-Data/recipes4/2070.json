Only one change if you are going to use onions (and you should...YUMMY) put them in about 10 min before taking the potatoes out or else they will just be crunchy and burnt. The high heat is a MUST and everything came out PERFECT!!!",

If you use larger potatoes, you'd have to cut them into smaller pieces and you'd lose the brown crispy part of it on some of the sides that are cut (which really makes the potato in my opinion!).  I used coarsely ground sea salt and coarsely crushed black pepper, and I also sprinkled the potatoes with parsley.  Next time I might add a little bit of rosemary also! ",
