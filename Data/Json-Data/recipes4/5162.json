Grate cheap grocery store brand Swiss cheese; it costs roughly $3 per pound instead of $18 or so per pound like Gruyere. Then pour about 3 T. of white wine over the 2 C. of the Swiss, toss, and let sit for at least 15 minutes. When ready to use, blot with a paper towel to remove excess wine, and it will remarkably cook up just like Gruyere. Your palate won't know the difference, but your pocketbook will!",

Reviewed on Nov. 22, 2011 by Avon\nThanks Celeste for the perfect, perfect au gratin potato recipe. Such a simple and yet elegant taste. Easy to put together and whatever you do, don't skimp on the ingredients. Use fresh ground nutmeg, the heavy cream, the yukon golds, and most of all the gruyere. It's not everynight of the week anyone needs to splurge on something so decadent, but for a special occasion or to make a meal memorable, just do i t. You won't be sorry.",

I chose to slice my potatoes a little thicker, perhaps between 1/8 and 1/4 inch, and only boiled them a few minutes to ensure they would not be reduced to mush.  I\u2019d do so exactly the same next time.   These are, indeed, rich and creamy and develop a beautiful and extra delicious golden brown crust as they bake.  I loved the subtle flavor of the nutmeg (fresh does make a big difference I believe), which was an ideal choice to enhance, just slightly, the flavor of the potatoes as well as that gorgeous Gruyere cheese.  Not only were these a decadent  taste sensation, they were remarkably easy to assemble as well \u2013 no sauce to prepare, just layer cream and cheese!  After sampling these it will be interesting to see if I ever go back to traditional au gratin potatoes prepared with cheddar again.",

I had planned a different potato recipe and at the last minute decided on these, so I had already had whole, boiled potatoes, so I just peeled them, sliced them thin and proceeded w/ the recipe. I seasoned them w/ some garlic powder and salt (as well as the pepper and nutmeg) to compensate for what I did not do during the boiling, which worked out fine. Also, and I know this is major, so PLEASE forgive me, but I actually only had a very small amount of Gruyere on hand that my mom gave me, so I did end up using some creamy Irish white cheddar (Ballyshannon) as well, and it went perfectly. These were so creamy and flavorful...a real hit at dinner. I will def be making these again and again (probably subbing cheeses as needed, lol). Thanks, Celeste, for this wonderful recipe. :)",

I made the entire dish up to the point where it was ready to bake the night before, then covered and refrigerated it overnight. I was worried the potatoes would be mushy, so I sliced them a bit thicker than the recipe called for, but they were just fine. They baked while I roasted the asparagus and tossed the salad, and were perfect. I loved the Gruyere in this, and would definitely make it again. This reminded me of the individual baked portions of au gratin potatoes I've had at a local steakhouse - one of my favorite splurges there. Thanks for sharing Celeste!",
