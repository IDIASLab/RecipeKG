All our problems should be so little!  Almost every reviewer loved this one and so many said not to change a thing - so I didn't. And I agree.  This is a bit time consuming - although I was trying out two other new recipes today so mayble that is why I think that.  I had some leftover today and my bacon is not soggy - so I think the key there is to make sure your bacon is very crisp (not burned - just crisp!).  Oops, I lied!  I did make one minor change - I too used green onions instead of regular - I always use scallions instead of onions in all my potato and macaroni salads. I feel the green onions give salads a better crunch. Thank you submitter.",

I made it the same day I served it, as I was worried about soggy bacon, and it was all gone in an hour!  This is a definite keeper, and I am making it again this weekend!",

When potatoes were done I spread them out on a large cookie sheet and sprinkled with some fresh chopped dill and a little red wine vinegar.  While they were cooling I mixed 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream, chopped dill pickles, chopped eggs and green onions in a small bowl. When the potatoes cooled I put them in my serving bowl and poured my mayo sour cream mixture over the potatoes and mixed just enought to cover. I kept it in the fridge overnight to let the flavors mesh together and added bacon just before serving. Delish!",

To start I'll try 1 cup of Mayo... (Hellman's of course), 3 eggs and 1/2 a pound of crispy bacon, I can always add more if I think it's needed; or I could probably use 4 to 5 lbs of potatoes. I'll post an update after I make this recipe. UPDATE: I made this recipe today, July 3rd. As written I found 2 lbs of potatoes just wasn't the proper ratio to the amounts of mayonnaise, eggs and bacon. I wound up using about 5 lbs of potatoes. I also added more celery, 3 ribs, 2 green onions thinly sliced, and a small green pepper, seeded and dice fine. With these additions, the 2 cups of mayonnaise and 6 eggs were the perfect amounts; although next time I would only use 1/2 lb of bacon, 1 lb was still a bit too much. I'm sure this will taste even better tomorrow, for our July 4th cook-out.",

Cubed the potatoes, tossed in a bag with olive oil, pepper, seasoned salt, paprika, garlic powder and dill weed.  Roasted on a baking stone until tender.  1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream as so many have so wisely recommended, 1/2 the onion but added fresh chives to it.  Only needed 1/2 the bacon for my tastes - but dear hubby put a handful of the leftover bits on his one serving!   Added 1/2 the sauce to the potatoes when I made it so it could blend overnight but not get soggy and then the other 1/2 the next morning to freshen it up.  Will use this recipe forever more - so much better than traditional potato salad!!  To all those who mentioned it's a lot of prep work - all good homemade potato salad is, but with this one at least you don't have to do all that peeling! :)",
