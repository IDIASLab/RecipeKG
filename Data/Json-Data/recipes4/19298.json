Meat eaters think I have fallen off the wagon when they smell this and start looking for the chicken bouillon box. If the dish is too runny at 45 minutes, uncover and continue to simmer.",

I did make two minor changes (one in an ingredient and one in preparation). Hubby is not near as picky as he used to be so I do change things up some for his benefit. He is weird about tomatoes and stewed are a big no in his book. He only tolerates smaller ones with more texture so I used petite diced. He will eat a completely cooked bell pepper but I know that he prefers and actually enjoys them when they still have a nice crunch to them. I added them in the last 10 minutes of cook time and that was perfect. I did end up having to add another 1/2 water but other than that this worked as written.",
