Done and done!!!!!!!\nThis recipe made a LOT of food... but I tried a bunch of Ethiopian dishes including meat dishes and this was by far the winner of the bunch.  The good thing about making this quantity of food in one sitting is that it freezes well and is even more delicious when you go back to it.\nI failed attempting to make injera, so I probably won't try that again however I served it with rice which paired perfectly with it.  I found smoked Basmati rice at my supermarket... and WOW!  The perfect pairing!!!",

I would suggest starting with maybe 1/5 the berbere and then adding the right amount to taste at the end. Recipe instructions also could use to be rewritten so they don't include ingredient amounts (which don't match the ingredient list when the recipe is scaled down). Default recipe size of 16 servings was way too large. I scaled it down to \"six\" servings and we will have enough leftovers to last the rest of the week.",
