I did the pear like it stated melted 2 sticks of butter 1/2 cup of brown sugar and lil bit of white and a lil bit of real vanilla heated it up in the microwave. I used 12 pears I picked from the orchard yesterday each pear got 2 big spoon fills over each. put in the oven at 350 for 1/2 hr. Basted each with it's own sauce then mixed some fresh raspberries with some water and sugar in the blender and each got 2 spoon fills back in the oven for 30-45 min. OMG this was such a hit the whole apartment was like what's that and everyone wanted some but my biggest person to please is my 13 yr old child. HE LOVED IT ate 3 big pears once it was cut up....",

The pears were still crunchy after an hour and the specified amount of honey and butter didn't give enough syrup to continue basting it through the cooking. The flavor was nice but nothing too intense. The sauce that was left was REALLY good over ice cream and I'm going to try to make some kind of ginger cinnamon syrup for ice cream in the future. I may make this again because it tasted pretty good but only if I happen to have a few pears laying around. I wouldn't go out of my way to make this.",

I finally made it tonight but I didn't make four pears--only 2 bc bf just doesn't share my same love for pears. He likes them but isn't as enthusiastic. I had a little trouble coring the pear from the bottom--I broke the first one by trying to cut up too far but on the second one I had better luck. I just cut in a circle and removed the core with my fingers. Anyway I didn't bother melting the butter either and added more honey (didn't really measure just poured on). I added cinnamon as well. Baked perfectly in an hour. The syrup is definitely delicious and the pears were delicious with it. Bf and I shared a pear so we'll have the other one tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe!",
