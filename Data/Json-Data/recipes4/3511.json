Not sure why that is, but I hope the addition of my 5-star rating and review helps at least somewhat to set the record straight. I prepared this recipe fairly closely, however, I substituted black olives for the green (it's what I had on hand and I liked that idea better anyway) and I only used the dressing (with white wine vinegar) to taste - to use the entire amount called for would have been far too much for us. No problem tho' - the dressing is good, so we'll enjoy it on a tossed salad another night.  I also left out the tomatoes as I don't care for what happens to them in salads after refrigeration. If I was to use them, however, I would add them just before serving. This bean salad rivals those you'd find in a gourmet deli, but certainly at a fraction of the cost you'd expect to pay for it there.  Lots of flavors, textures and color interest. A near ideal combination of ingredients.",

It all blends together to be just delicious, and I can't wait to make it again.  Oh...and I couldn't get fresh thyme, so I used about a really fat teaspoon of dried and it was just fine.
