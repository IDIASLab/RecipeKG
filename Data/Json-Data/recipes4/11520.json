First I only used one 6.5 oz can of minced clams but I chopped up about 3/4 cup mushrooms and added that for more \"meatiness\". I didn't have any white wine on hand (shame!) so I used the clam juice and chicken broth with a twist of fresh lemon juice and a splash of half-and-half to give the sauce some body. I also wanted a thicker sauce so I thickened it with 2 tsp corn starch and 2 tsp cold half-and-half. The lemon gave it a great balance of acidity (replacing the wine). I also boiled my pasta in a broth/water combo for more flavor. Overall a very quick dish paired with a spinach salad! Perfect!",
