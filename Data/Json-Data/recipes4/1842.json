I added the following ingredients: 3 red potatoes diced, 1 celery stalk sliced, 6 oz tomato paste, 2 cloves garlic, 2 bay leaves, paprika, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauces, 1 cup organic beef stock, 4 slices bacon and a crock pot.  You'll want to warm your crock pot before putting the stew in it.  Take 1/3 cup flour (omit the 3 tablespoons vegetable oil) and place in gallon bag with meat, shake to coat and set aside.  Cut bacon up and fry in pan with mix of butter and oil (1 tablespoon each).  Remove bacon, save bacon fat in pan.  Add meat and brown, add onions and saute with meat.  Move meat, bacon and onions to crock pot.  Deglaze hot pan with 1 can Guinness, 1 cup beef stock, and 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce, add to crock pot.  Add all other ingredients and cook on low for 8-10 hours.  Check the liquid level, I had to add a total of 2 more cups beef stock while it was stewing.  The kicker, serve over Champ (mashed potatoes and green onions), and Irish soda bread (with raisins) to soak up the stew left in the bowl, there's no other way to get the full flavor!  Enjoy!",

Then remove meat and brown about 1 cup of very finely chopped onions, carrots, and clove of garlic over medium heat about 5-7 minutes stirring often.  Use some guiness to loosen up the brown bits in the pan and add meat back to the stew and continue.  The meat will brown way better in small batches (patience) and give more flavor instead of steaming in it's juices when you crown the pan.  The idea is: little bit of meat = drier heat & inside doesn't overcook + outside crusty.  The roasted veggies add a deep flavor that I love in most stews. I think it's a key step. Vary the amount to your liking.",
