If you use butter as well, add 1/2 c more of flour, to compensate for the natural water content in most supermarket butters.  Also, after mixing, let the batter sit for about 10 minutes, to allow the oats to take in the wet ingredients. I also baked at 325 instead of 350, because it seemed like they were burning at the higher temp.  The cookies are cakelike, and go great with a glass of cold milk. I just have to wonder if the vanilla cuts down the honey flavor.  Next time, I will omit the vanilla from the recipe and see how that works out.",
