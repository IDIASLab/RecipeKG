I scaled it down to five servings and used whipped cream cheese. I also took it out of the oven a few minutes short of the 30 min specified. Good side dish but I had some right out of the oven as a dip with mini tortilla chips. I'm thinking this will be a good side for a holiday buffet. Can see adding some sauteed onions to this as well. Nice recipe!",
