Made the second batch with the suggestion of Breeze and added a few tbsp of peanut butter.  With the second batch, I just free-formed them onto parchment paper.  No sticking at all, and with the fingertips wet, they were easy to mold into little nests making them a little smaller and got more out of the batch. Used 'peeps' rabbits in some, marshmallow chicks in others, and cadbury pastel chocolate eggs.  I like the chocolate flavor with the nest.  Love the versatility of this recipe.  Could also add some butterscotch morsels to the marshmallow/butter mixture, or chocolate chips.  So cute and easy!  Nice presentation on the Easter goodie trays.  thanks for the recipe.",
