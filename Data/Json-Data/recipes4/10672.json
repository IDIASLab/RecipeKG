Of course we started out with a smoked turkey then instead of turkey stock and water I used a can of low sodium chicken broth. Also I used macaroni noodles instead of rigatoni. I used the entire package of onion soup mix didn't add any salt to the recipe (I figured that it would have enough from the chick broth and soup mix). For cheese I used about a cup of cheddar and a cup of mozerella. Turned out very well!",
