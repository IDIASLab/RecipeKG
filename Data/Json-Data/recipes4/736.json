For those who had problems with crumbling, a little extra egg will do the trick. This meatloaf freezes well too. I sliced mine before freezing it to make for easier reheating and serving. BTW, this goes great with Allie's Delicious Macaroni and Cheese (also from this site) as they both cook at the same temp. and have complimentary flavors. Thanks for a great recipe!",

I raised the servings to 8, added two full eggs rather than the 1 1/3, used the Bold & Spicy A-1 sauce to give it extra zing..Mmmm,  breadcrumbs I had in the freezer that I had made from whole- wheat bread, toasted, broken up, and put it a Cusinart blender that has super sharp blades. Left out the green peppers as I did not have any, didn't miss them, though I am sure you could add what you like and it would remain awesome providing the liquid level of this recipe is kept in balance with items added.",

This was the one.  I did read reviews and noted that if you use all A1, it's kind of strong, so I did the A1 in the meatloaf and brushed the top with a bbq sauce I had instead.  Perfect.  Was very happy.  Went to 2-1/2 pounds of meat/2 eggs and it needed to cook longer - did one hour as called for, then upped the temp to 375 for another 15-20 minutes.  Didn't dry it at all.",

Here are the changes/additions I made.  I added 1/2 tsp. of dried sage, 1/2 tsp. of dried parsley, added more egg, used cream instead of milk and used crushed Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. Also, instead of brushing the top with the rest of the A-1 steak sauce I combined about 1/3 cup of ketchup with about 3 Tbsp. of brown sugar and waited until it baked for an hour.  Then I turned the oven to broil, brushed the top of the meatloaf with my ketchup mixture and broiled (watching carefully to not burn) until carmelized.  Repeat process until desired crust is achieved....SOO GOOD!  Never had a meatloaf so simple yet so flavorful in my life.  My girlfriend doesn't really like ground beef and certainly didn't like meatloaf...but after making this...her thoughts have changed.  Thanks for sharing the love",

This needs a lot of help, but definitely has potential - but with all the tweaking I feel is necessary it wouldn't be the same recipe. This needs a whole lot more than just steak sauce! For the bread crumbs I used crushed, herb-seasoned stuffing mix.  I also added fresh parsley, sage, thyme and a healthy dose of Chicago Steak Seasoning. Once mixed it was drier than I would have preferred, so I gave it a couple shots of ketchup which was just fine since I felt it could use a little tomato flavor to balance the A-1 anyway. Rather than baking this in a loaf pan I just shaped and baked it on a foil-lined cookie sheet and it was perfectly done in an hour (160 degrees). Once sliced and eaten hubs and I both agree that while it was flavorful (why wouldn't it be with all the stuff I added to it?) it could have used less bread crumbs and maybe even another egg for a meatier flavor and firmer texture. On its own, however, this recipe is merely a basic, starting point to a potentially great finish.",
