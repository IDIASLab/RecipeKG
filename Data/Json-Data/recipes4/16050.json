This stops the cooking and adds flavor to the oil since you aren't using sausage.\n\nLook further, this is not authentic or worth the expense.  I was severely disappointed.  Be warned.

I like it in some things but not gumbo. Also I use a pound of Andouie sausage which I like to render some of the fat out of and use it in the roux. I add the meat of a couple chicken thighs diced Cod instead of catfish. I like the way it holds together and absorbs the flavors. It's my \"clean out the fridge\" gumbo so I throw in some diced ham if I have it. The okra goes in early enough to break up and the shrimp dead last. For heaven's sake if you burn the roux start over. Any Cajun knows file gumbo is going to be thicker. It's supposed to be so it sticks better to rice.",
