Only wish I'd taken Bek's other suggestion and added some pasta at the end but with the potatoes we were carb-content w/ this fab soup.",

Rather than chicken stock and beef broth I used low sodium vegetable broth and water. Didn't have tomato paste or diced tomatoes with jalape\u00f1os. I used diced tomatoes with garlic basil and oregano. No potatoes or celery. I added the garbanzo beans onions zucchini carrots green beans and the garlic. I also added in cooked crumbled sweet Italian chicken sausage. For spices I added Italian Herb seasoning some extra basil parsley and some pepper. My husband said he wants this on the rotation so I must have done something right with the on-hand ingredient tweaks.",

For using the leftover soup I made a double concentrated pint of chicken bouillon, then I added the bouillon and another can of garbanzo beans to the soup. It was better. That was the end of the soup, but if I'd still had more I would have continued the same approach to tone down the tomato. Not a bad recipe, just way to heavy on the tomato flavor for my taste.",
