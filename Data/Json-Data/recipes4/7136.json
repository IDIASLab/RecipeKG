Fresh everything nothing was frozen.) They turned out AMAZING. My husband (big meat eater) even compared them to meatballs and he loved them too.

I sauteed the onion in a couple Tbsp of butter and olive oil then did not add any more oil. I thawed and drained the spinach and kale together then mixed them the onion and egg together. I mixed the dry ingredients together minus the sage and oregano - because I was out and mixed the dry into the wet ingredients. I rolled them into balls refrigerated them overnight and baked them Thanksgiving morning. I got 18 balls out of this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing! edit I made another batch of these and was having issues with them getting stuck in my teeth. I finally figured out that it's the kale stems. My next batch will be all spinach no kale - which I think will solve this problem. If you are dead set on using kale I would either run the thawed drained kale through the food processor - or use fresh cutting out the tough stems first...",
