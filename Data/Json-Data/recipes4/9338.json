It was good fresh with butter and honey (although I would have liked a crunchier crust at this point) good the next day as toast and for sandwich bread. A very all-purpose whole wheat recipe. I might try increasing the amount of granola some next time. It more or less disappeared into the texture of the bread.

I cut a little off because it wouldn't fit in the gallon ziplock bag and tried a piece with some nutella for breakfast. I only had white wheat flour because my son won't eat regular wheat bread and vanilla almond granola (almonds picked out) but it turned out pretty well. The texture was good it stayed together well while cutting and eating it and it tastes good. However I didn't get a lot of granola crunch or that honey flavor that I was expecting. I'll make this again but will double the granola and the honey and see if that's closer to what I was expecting. Even if it's not I'll keep making this because it held up so well and makes a great sandwich bread.",
