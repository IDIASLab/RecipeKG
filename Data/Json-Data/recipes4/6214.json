Also I didn't have Catalina dressing but I did have Dorothy Lynch which I think is similar. So I used just a shade less than 1/2 C of Dorothy Lynch instead of Catalina. I didn't have white pepper so I put in just 1/4 tsp of black pepper total for fear that it might be too much. Other than that I kept the ingredients the same. I smeared the sauce on the fillets and then baked them uncovered in a baking dish for 20 minutes at 425 degrees. I cooked 2 fillets but the recipe made enough for 3 or 4. It is a little spicy but I like spice and I love Sriracha so it worked for me. I was worried that the 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder would be too much but it was perfect. I think next time I might cut the temp back to 400 or cover the dish because some of the sauce ran off the fillet into the dish and did start to burn a little. Thanks for submitting the recipe.",

However with this dish we had to make our own Catalina dressing as we didn't have any on hand. I don't like white pepper so I left that out as well. The fish turned out perfectly. It took 12 minutes to cook them and the sauce was great. We have never had Swai cooked like that so it was a nice change. I made some refried rice to go with the fish and together it was as good as any oriental restaurant has to offer. The only thing I can add is the next time we make this dish together it will include the normal Catalina dressing and not our own concoction. Definitely a keeper!",

I was very hesitant because Catalina dressing is a little too sweet for me on a salad but pair it with the other goodies in this recipe and slap it on fish and you have yourself a winner. It is rather spicy though so if you are sensitive to that you might want to leave out the crushed pepper flakes or cut back on the Sriracha. Can't wait to try this one on catfish this summer!",
