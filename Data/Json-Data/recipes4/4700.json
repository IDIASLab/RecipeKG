I left the lamb in a bit longer with the oven off it was medium done and more rare on the bottom. Next time I would try putting the leg on its own baking dish half-way through and covering the vegetables with a lid so that they would soften. I would also cut the vegetables into smaller pieces.",

I mixed the leftover rub into the veggies in the roaster since I was afraid there wouldnt be enough flavour on them. I made several small changes to the recipe; I used.5 tsp of cayenne pepper rather than the red pepper flakes (.33 would have been plenty) I used dry rosemary since I couldnt get any fresh I cut the veggies into cubes rather than wedges I reduced the heat from 400 after 20 minutes to 350 and stirred every 25 minutes or so and I let it sit for 10 minutes at the end. I was delighted with the outcome! I'll definately be cooking this again! Deliciousness!",
