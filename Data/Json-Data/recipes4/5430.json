I tripled the milk and flour (using heavy cream instead of milk), and reduced the salt and pepper ( just sprinkling some on each layer- so maybe 1 tsp. each in total.) I used Kirkland bacon bits instead of frying up bacon, but other than those adjustments stuck to the original. It had wonderful flavor, creamy and rich with just enough sauce( I can see why people commented about it being dry and needing more liquid, so that is why I tripled it- thanks for the heads up!. The salty, smoky taste of the ham and bacon were a delightful addition to the potatoes and this is high comfort food. I will make this again- very good!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe has a lot of promise but 2 tablespoons of salt and 2 tablespoons of pepper is a lot of spice for 10 potatoes. Also, as another mentioned, there is no way you can cook this for 2 hours and use only 2/3 cup of liquid with a thickener. My first attempt at this recipe was far too salty for us to enjoy but we used milk to reheat the next day and that helped make it more edible. I also used 4 - 4-1/2 cups milk with appropriate amount of flour. \n\nSo anyhow, next time I will  use only 2 teaspoons of salt, 1/2 pepper and more milk with less flour. I may  try parboiling the potatoes to quicken the cooking time as well. \n\nIt's a great recipe otherwise. The flavor was fantastic once we got past the salt. The simplicity was appreciated.",

First, I made the bacon in the oven.  Then, I cut up the bacon. I shredded 1 cup of cheddar cheese.  I chopped 1/2 an onion and sauteed the onions with 1 T. of butter.  I added 3 T. of flour and  2 and 1/3 cups of milk, 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper and whisked the sauce. I let the sauce simmer about 5 minutes. I added some sauce to the bottom of the baking dish.  I sprayed the pan with a cooking spray.  I  then added the bacon to each layer. I added some sauce to the bottom of the pan and layered per directions. The scalloped potatoes were done in an hour.",

I used 1T of potato flour and to keep the milk/flour mixture as a liquid I ended up using 2/3c of skim milk. It was creamy great flavor texture and heard lots of \"mmmmm's\" during dinner.
