Scooped out fat by the ladlefuls and added more water. I also added about 2 tbsp of vinegar at the end and simmered it for another hour to develop the taste. Next time I'm going to use the pressure cooker to get the Oxtail more tender to cut the cooking time. I don't have 3 hours to cook a stew when I can do it in less than half the time. Overall not too bad for a basic stew but you'll have to tweak to your liking.",

Added parsnips which was a great cinnamon flavor 3. Used Lawry's seasoning salt for add'l flavor (salt / pepper / paprika / onion & garlic powder work) 4. Next time I will use less water. Soup ended up less thick than in photo 5. I used only 1.5 lbs oxtail and kept rest of portions the same and it was fine",

I also used a presure cooker to cut back on the cooking time to 1 1/2 hours from the required 3 hours but some of the meat stuck to the bottom of the pot and did not pressurize well enough during the last half hour. Will definitely do this meal again.",
