                "reviewBody": "The batter should not be \"stiff\" or thick. That's what makes the puffs so tender inside. I make these several times a year and they come out \"perfect\" if you follow the recipe exactly as it is. As another reviewer mentioned, you must wait until the water and butter are at a full rolling boil and then add the flour all at once. It also makes a difference if you don't add the eggs one by one as stated. The picture I added above is of this exact recipe followed 100% as it is. \nEdited to add: Please note that in different areas, \"heavy\" and \"whipping\" cream are the same thing. This is definitely meant to be the kind of cream you \"whip\".\nAlso, if your puffs deflate when they come out of the oven, this could be due to banging the cookie sheet too hard, or simply the climate in your area. I find a foolproof way to prevent deflating is to cut a slit in the side of each puff as soon as you take them out of the oven to allow the hot air to escape and prevent them from falling. I notice someone mentioned their puffs were burning on the bottom. Mine have never done this, but some ovens run hotter than others so try reducing the heat to 400 degrees instead. Also, I use a Silpat which seems to work well with these.",

Basically one key is that you HAVE to make sure the water and butter are at a rolling boiling before adding the flour!! If your liquid is not hot enough the flour won't set correctly. The rest is very lovely. My boyfriend loves profiteroles and I made this for his birthday. He was very impressed!",

I use a piping bag for the dough (it helps with uniformity but it isn't necessary) and I usually like to mix the cream with the sugar and the rose water before I whip it. Easier fewer steps. If you're planning on serving these later wait to put the chocolate sauce on because once it dries the flavor of the sauce is lost and it just lends an awkward texture to the profiteroles.",

As others have said bring the water and butter to a rolling boil then add all the flowers and remove from heat then stir then add eggs one at a time. Dollops should be about a heaping tbsp. I can fit about 12 on a standard cookie sheet. Don't let them fall down; try to pile them high so they puff up not out. I only cooked mine for 20 minutes. My second batch of puffs were a lot bigger so they took 24 minutes. Some of them deflated but most of them stayed puffed. The smaller ones held up better. The 1 cup of cream made enough filling for me. I added 1 tsp of vanilla instead of rose water. I would suggest using a bit less than 1/4 cup of sugar because it's really sweet! I used a chopstick to make a hole in the bottom once they were cool pressed a ziplock piping bag up against the hole and squeezed the bag until I felt the puff inflate with cream. Then dipped it in the melted chocolate mixture and YUM! They taste real and awesome.",
