I used a can of reduced fat cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of milk & 1/4 cup of chicken broth (all I had) in place of the 2 cups of chicken broth. I also used a frozen veggie blend with carrots, peas, corn, lima beans & green beans. I mixed the rice, soup & liquids together and then poured in the pan. Poured the frozen veggies on top and then layered the chicken over that. Used sea salt, garlic powder, pepper & paprika. This turned out amazing and I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today!!  UPDATE: The leftovers were even better b/c all the flavors had time to mix together. You could definitely make this ahead of time & freeze until you want to serve it!",
