Tie the parsely bay leaf peppercorns and lobster shells into cheesecloth and drop into soup when called for. Then you can just remove later. Secondly you can use a submersion blender to puree the soup before adding the sherry and cream. This will give it a more traditional bisque look also. Great Soup!",
