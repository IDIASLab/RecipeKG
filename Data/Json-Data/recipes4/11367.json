The result was flavorful to be sure but the flavors were not balanced correctly. I ate it nonetheless and doused it with yogurt to mask the strong turmeric taste. I guess you could make this with 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric & garam masala and it MIGHT be OK but there are so many other great Indian/Pakistani dishes out there that I wouldn't bother.",

It's low-fat low calorie high fiber and packed with vitamins. It's easy to make substitutions using what you have on hand. It's cheap! I made this for my book club when we met after reading \"Three Cups of Tea \" which takes place in Pakistan. Since there were 10 of us I doubled the recipe and hoped it would be enough. It made a HUGE amount of food. What was supposed to be 8 servings turned out to be closer to 20--though it was served as a side dish. Even if I had only made a single recipe it still wouldn't have fit in a medium saucepan! I followed the recipe relatively closely with probably a little extra on the spices. The next time I plan to try yams instead of potatoes. I served this with Pakistani Spicy Chickpeas from this site basmati rice (cooked in a rice cooker with 3 whole cardamon pods some turmeric and a pinch of saffron) and frozen naan (Indian bread) from Trader Joes. I love Indian food and this was close but a lot less greasy. Do check out the detailed nutrition information on this recipe. I am in awe that anything that tastes this good can be so good for you!",
