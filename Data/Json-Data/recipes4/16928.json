The only changes I made were to add a little more water, and I also baked it in the oven since I was already roasting some broccoli to have as a side. I garnished the cod with fresh sliced green onion and some toasted sesame seeds - really pretty! Served it with the roasted brocc, and lo mein noodles tossed with a bit of sesame oil. Really awesome recipe. Thanks, AnnnCollin!",
