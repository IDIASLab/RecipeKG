The sauce is what intrigued me about this one.  It is absolutely tremendous.  DO NOT change this recipe at all, or skimp and buy el cheapo chicken strips, even if you think they are good.  Make this recipe exactly how it says to make it, with the exception of the waffles.  Make fresh waffles.  Frozen waffles have no flavor, and if you get a nice, sweet waffle mix, the contrast between the sweetness of the waffles and the sauce, and the saltiness of the bacon along with the heat of the chicken is an awesome combination.  I have made this for many many groups of friends, and everyone says it is absolutely delicious, and wonderfully unique.  If you get complaints on this one, you made it wrong.",

My husband gave it 11 out of 10 stars and my baby girl said it deserves infinity stars. Granted it is not the most healthy meal but it doesn't hurt to indulge every now and then. I made my own 9\" waffles using one of the recipes on the site. I also used 4 good sized chicken breast that I cut into about 16 chicken tenders. From there I followed the recipe however I substituted horseradish for baconaise sauce, buttermilk instead of heavy cream, and 3 teaspoons of regular mustard instead of 1 teaspoon of dry mustard powder. We didn't have any bacon to go with these but it wasn't needed. Slapped some velveeta on these babies, broiled them, added the yummy sauce, a lil bit of lettuce, then pressed them down and sliced each one in half. Because I used 9\" waffles they turned out HUGE!!! My husband was the only one that was able to finish his but not for lack of trying. I almost finished half of one, my 5 year old eat about 1/4 of one and my 7 and 13 year old also eat half. Between the 5 of us we could have gotten away with just 3 waffles instead of 4. I was skeptical about putting the mayonnaise sauce with spicy chicken and waffles but it was a delicious, flavorful, and unique experience. Excellent for a fathers day breakfast/brunch or any special occasion that requires a hearty meal.",

                "reviewBody": "I used 4 chicken breasts that were cut smaller and lightly pounded instead of chicken tenders (or is that the same thing?). For the egg mixture I only used a teaspoon of each seasoning as using a tablespoon of each seemed wasteful and unnecessary flavour-wise. That said I would probably use an egg or two less next time and substituted soy milk for the heavy cream. For the dry mixture I omitted the salt. Next time I'd use a 1:1 ratio for the flour and cornstarch as there was plenty leftover even after double dipping. I didn't have peanut oil so I used vegetable oil. I did not deep-fry; I did them chicken in a pan with the oil as needed and did them in batches. The sauce is delicious! I probably used only a half cup of mayo (whatever was left in my small jar) and added everything it and shook it to combine. I didn't have prepared horseradish but had the dry (powder) kind so I used two teaspoons of that; I'd probably do 1:1 ratio for the mustard and horseradish powders next time. The maple syrup was spot on. Had to skip the bacon and used processed cheese slices. I used regular waffles this time around but would use Belgian ones next time as they are larger and easier to grip (maybe make homemade cornmeal Belgian waffles? I seriously have to get a waffle-maker!). I also added lettuce and tomato to my sandwich. DELICIOUS! Served it with some cinnamon-spiced sweet potato fries from AR. Definitely going to make it again.",
