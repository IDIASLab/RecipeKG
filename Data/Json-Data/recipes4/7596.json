I substituted V8 reduced sodium vegetable juice for the full-sodium tomato juice and cut back the amount to around 2 - 2.5 cups. I did not decrease the beef broth. As a result I did not have a lot of juice left over after the meat and veg were gone. It all came out even. I also used no-salt-added diced tomatoes. Instead of the package of frozen mixed veg I added chopped carrots green pepper and celery along with the potatoes. I kept the leftovers from supper in the crock pot overnight on warm and it tasted even better the next day for lunch.",
