Thanks to other reviewers I increased the recipe for the sauce quite a bit. This is necessary as having extra for a dipping sauce is a MUST! I did add a little water (tried olive oil too but didn't work as well). It is too thick if you don't. You have to really watch this on the grill so the sauce doesn't get burnt. Also as one reviewer suggested I added some brown sugar just to the dipping sauce. This makes a huge difference also. I probably increased the sauce by 4xs but I was cooking 8 breasts. We will definitely make it again. Thanks!",

The first time I made this, I baked it and it came out pretty good.  Recently, I followed the recipe and grilled it.  The grill roasts the peanut butter and gives it a carmelized flavor that baking just cannot replicate.  While the chicken was grilling, I made a douple recipe of the sauce, added 1 1/2 tsp sugar and more water, and brought it to a boil in a sauce pan.  I served the chicken over whole wheat pasta and topped with the extra sauce.",

I only cooked 2 breasts; there are only 2 of us, and I didn't want to heat up the grill for just 2 breasts, so I broiled them in my toaster oven.  I always have to play with recipes, so I added about a tablespoon of rice vinegar and about 1/2 teaspoon of sugar to the sauce.  I used all the sauce on the 2 breasts and they came out great; rich and delicious, and the sauce carmelized beautifully.  I served them with Sesame Noodles from this site, and braised bok choy.  Excellent meal.",

Following another reviewers advice I doubled the recipe (and actually added some ground ginger) and after brushing chicken thighs with teh mixture (it was thicker than I expected) I added some chicken broth to thin it out and then used that as a sauce to pour onto the chicken and some rice. It was really good I will use it again (maybe on shrimp) and my husband really liked it as well although it could have been spicier for him (and me as well). Thanks for a great new recipe!",
