Thank you to D&D Market (the new Wethersfield, CT store) for the fresh ingredients to make this great recipe. Using cauliflower as your rice makes this dish a perfect paleo side dish or main course! This is also a stove-to-table dish without any mess in 30 minutes!",

Satisfying to the eye and to the tongue, it was a warm, filling lunch on a cold day in January!  My only change was to use turkey sweet Italian sausage, as that was all I could find at the grocer.  I also do not have a paella pan, so my 12\" skillet was filled to the brim!  Thanks for posting, Cindy!",
