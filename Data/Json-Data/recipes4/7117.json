These had a great explosion of flavor that we all loved. I also used homemade guacamole, and hubby had salsa on his b/c he doesn't care for guac.

Omitted the jalapeno since the kidlet was eating it but added in some ancho chili powder instead. Not being a huge cumin fan I'll reduce it a bit in the future. I did sprinkle in some garlic & onion powders as well as some ground pepper too. Next time I'll be sure to buy another package of ground chicken...we polished off all 4 patties! It's the time of year they're roasting the Hatch chiles here in Colorado so next time there will a roasted chile on my burger! Loved everything about this burger; even grilling them in the rain!",

Next time I would cut back a bit on the cumin so it doesnt taste so much like taco meat. I did add some lime zest to the meat which gave it an extra kick.
