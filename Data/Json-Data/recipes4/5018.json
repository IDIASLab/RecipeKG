                "reviewBody": "This was very good and receives lots of compliments but gets 4 stars as written. It's a 4.5 star with the following: The chicken step is a lot of work. If your local market sells fresh cooked chicken mix it with the cup of BBQ sauce and it saves a lot of time. Unless you really LOVE bell peppers 4 bell peppers is a lot. So if you just LIKE bell peppers reduce to 2 or 3 peppers and you'll have PLENTY. I substituted celery for the remaining amount of peppers and it adds a lot. I jullienned my jicama and it wilted by serving time. If serving cold there are a few things that don't hold that well: Jicama and the cilantro. I'd suggest saving out at least some of the cilantro (since it does add a lot of flavor during the chill) and all of the jicama until closer to serving time.If you add a bit of green onion it also helps to freshen the look of the salad. Finally my impression was that it was a little too sweet (might depend on your BBQ sauce) so I added some lime mixed with a bit of water olive oil salt and pepper to add a slight citrus dimension -- about 1/3 of a cup of this lime vinagrette. Next time I'll probably just whisk some lime just into the mayo before adding it into the salad. Makes a ton of food. UPDATE: I've started cutting back on the mayo and have increased evoo and lime. Just fresher tasting that way.",

I've made this a several times and the family loves it with only a couple modifications due to our taste preference: only (1) orange and (1) red bell pepper no jalapeno peppers and didn't have cilantro... Have to agree with previous reviews to leave out the jicama until ready to serve. I've made it with out any peppers or jicama (just didn't have any) instead added can of green beans & kidney beans... Tip: you bake the chicken breast in a smoky seasoning of personal preference & the BBQ sauce... We have also combined ranch dressing with the BBQ sauce (we use that on several salads!) Yum!!!

I did scale this recipe back by half. I cannot find jicama anywhere in the area I live so I just omitted it. I also did not add the jalapeno pepper because I was feeding two kids. To make this a little......cheaper I did skip the step of cooking the chicken in the barbeque sauce only because I didn't want to overuse the little bit that I had in case I needed it for another recipe. I just cooked the chicken with some spices in my slow cooker for most of the day cooled it and then pieced it out for the salad. Very interesting take on pasta salad my two kids especially liked it. NO leftovers. I would make this again.",

And I also used one box of medium bow tie pasta as that was all I had. This was surprisingly fantastic! My husband and 4yr old devoured it.

I also followed the advice of other commenters and only used 2 peppers and a few stalks of celery and that turned out great. I would caution other readers that this recipe makes A LOT of food!!!
