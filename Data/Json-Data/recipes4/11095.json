I added a few more potatoes and a small spoonful of brown sugar. My family raved about it. It was a very pretty dish and exceptional in flavor. The beef was extremely tender.

For me it was nice to taste something different especially when it tastes good. I did take heed to other reviewers comments and added and subtracted some things to make the taste more \"palatable\" but nothing that would turn it into a different recipe. It still has that \"special\" taste which comes from the beer. NOTE: I doubled the recipe. I used 9 cloves of garlic 3 large potatoes almost 4 lbs of stew meat 3/4 of a 2lb bag of baby carrots (cause I didn't want to cut carrots) 2 small onions 2 12oz bottles of Guinness as much oil and flour as needed to brown the meat 2 6oz cans of tomato paste 3 cups of Mushrooms and 4 cups of beef broth. ADDED: My additions were a result of reading the reviews. I added twice the meat and more potatoes than carrots. I added sea salt and pepper to the flour that I used to brown the meat. I have found in my limited cooking experience that seasoning meat before it is cooked is never a bad idea. I also added a little sea salt to the stew. To bring in a familiar taste a little thyme a little basil and a couple of bay leaves. To curb the bitterness of the Guinness two teaspoons of brown sugar. SUBTRACTED: Corn starch and water as I had planned to cook it all day and others mentioned that the sauce would reduce/thicken over time.",
