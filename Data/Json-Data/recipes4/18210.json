The flavor doesn\u2019t quite match that of a sugar-made granola; but they are still delicious, and a definite new staple at our place. I made the recipe as directed, and they are just slightly crumbly, so I froze them, cut and bagged, and kept them in the freezer.  I made a triple batch and pressed it in an 11x14 baking dish, so there were  plenty to go around for a few weeks.",
