As others did I replaced the Ramen noodles with Cheerios although I think that it would be just as good with the noodles. I also omitted the raisins because I m not a big raisin fan and added extra almonds. Since the recipe does say it is a cinnamon snack mix I added cinnamon to the butter and honey mix. I lined the pan with foil and sprayed with Pam for an easy clean up. I stirred the mix twice while it was in the oven. The Teddy Grahams do burn easy. Thanks for a great recipe! Will definately be making again.",

Keep stirring honey-butter to prevent burning less than 3min its melted and ready to pour over mix. Use foil on baking sheet for easy removal cooks fast in oven so watch for browning.
