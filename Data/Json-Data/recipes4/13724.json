I sauteed the green pepper, onion, and celery in two tablespoon of olive oil. I sliced the sausage and cooked them for 10 minutes in a separate pan. I added all the ingredients to the veggies and mixed everything together well. I added the sausage last and let all the ingredients cook together for about 45 minutes - 1hr. Once it was done we ate it over rice. I used red onion instead of the white onion. I also added 1 tbs of cumin. I will definitely make this again.",

It can be kept for a long time int he fridge and it feezes well too! I would definitely recommend this one, even for kids! Get some fiber in them!",

I found the end product to be a bit too saucy for my tastes but that's probably because I increased the vegetables & they cooked out more liquid so that's something to consider if like me you wind up increasing the veggies. I halved this recipe; 1 sausage 2 beans 1 whole onion 4 stalks celery 1 whole pepper half a can of tomato product (in my case diced tomatoes) (and seasonings but we're talking volume here) fit neatly into my 3 quart crockpot with a little bit of room to spare but not a whole lot.

(If I make this again I'll go with a can of diced tomatoes instead.) I should've just gone w/ my instinct (and rumbling stomach at the delicious aroma that it emitted) and pulled it from the crock pot early. Idk I like my beans to be beans and not to disappear into a thick moosh which is sort of what happened here. Don't get me wrong the taste was pretty good (I also added a generous TB of Josyln's \"Creole Seasoning Blend\") but I think I'd rather stick to a beans/rice dish on the stovetop. The thickness of it; however was nicely complimented by a blanket of lightly-seasoned brown rice beneath it.",
