I boiled whole (with skins) for 10\", cooled, and then peeled and diced.  They were so sticky I did as someone else suggested and rinced the cubed potatoes off in water, thoroughly dried, and then proceeded to oi, bag and tag.  This morning, heated up a small cast iron skillet with a little olive oil and some butter, reached in the bag, grabbed a handful and TADAH!  Crispy crunchy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside - - - simply wonderful.  Thank you SO much for recipe!  I'll be making this monthly from now on :) UPDATE:  Just an fyi - I've found so many uses for these potatoes!  They're also great for  pot pies; potatoe, clam chowder, and vegetable soups; added to breakfast burritos, etc.  We simply adore them.",
