A couple of things lost in the editing process...definitely put a rough chop to the  veggies, and make cubes smaller than you would for say, a cheese plate.  Will melt and spread better.  And they forgot Tabasco sauce in the list of ingredients....a few shakes or more depending  on how spicy you like .  Or just have a bottle on the side so your guests can drizzle.  Hope you enjoy your Mardi Gras celebrations! And other celebrations throughout the year that bring food, friends, and family together!  Saveur.",

Only a couple changes mostly for personal tastes. I found a hot giardiniera relish at the store and figuring that it already had been chopped into nice sized bits I reduced the amount to 1/4 cup and used 1/2 cup each green and black olives roughly chopped them to match the relish. The first batch I used salami and the second time I used mortadella and served with bread both were amazing!",
