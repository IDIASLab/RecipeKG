I did do a few tiny changes but I think that if I had made none at all it still would be great....first and formost I think that this recipe should be made during the day the first time. Slow cookers vary so much that it is a good idea to be able to keep an eye on it. I know that my old slow cooker would have probably burned this recipe as it was my new one worked out perfectly as directed. The only changes I made was to use 3 apples (instead of 2) I added 1/2 cup of raisins and lastly I grated in the rind of 1 lemon. I ate this cold for breakfast and I felt like I was eating a wonderful delicious dessert.",

When eating it my husband and I added a bit of splenda while 3 children choose agave and 1 choose white sugar. I like my oatmeal a little thinker so next time (and their will be a next time) I will use a little less water. Otherwise yummy start to a Friday fall morning.",

Little too heavy on the cinnamon for our taste, so I will cut that back a little in the future.  By reducing the amount of water, it did cook a little faster than indicated, so mine was done in about 4 hours.  Garnished with freshly-sliced apples and a sprinkle of brown sugar.  Packaged and in the freezer for quick weekday breakfasts.",

I added dried mixed and chopped fruit instead of the apples. I thought it needed some salt to counter the sweet so I added 1/2 a teaspoon. I also added two tablespoons of olive oil to round out the texture and add MUFAs (monounsaturated fatty acids)to the meal. With these two additions it was absolutely five stars! I used the steel cut oats and sprayed the pot and it did not stick. I will so be making this again and again. Thanks for posting it Debbie!",

Added another apple and threw in a banana that was ripe and needed to be used up. Didn't have sweetener so I just used a tbsp of brown sugar.Cooked on low for about 5 hours,then popped the whole thing in the fridge overnight. Warmed up bowl this morning and it was awesome!! BIG cinnamon taste, so the only thing I would say is use less if you're not sure, I love cinnamon so I thought it was great! And I cut the recipe in half and still have enuff for 5 breakfasts, divided it up and put in the freezer-soo easy to take to work!! Thanks for sharing this!!",
