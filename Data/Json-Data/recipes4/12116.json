I live in Peru and eat it frequently. It's one of my kids' favorites.  Chicken legs are used instead of breasts.  Onion and aji (or other spicy pepper) is a must.  Saute onion, garlic, and pureed aji, then liquify these with the cilantro and chicken broth.  Fresh peas and carrots are always better (you can't get frozen veggies in Peru).  ",

Heat olive oil in pot and saute chopped red onion and rice for about 5 mins. Add the chicken/cilantro broth and bring to boil, reduce to low and let cook. When done fluff with fork, toss with chopped scallions and add salt & pepper to taste.",

After reading other reviews I made some adjustments to steps 2 and 3 to avoid the blandness. For step 3 I used fresh carrots (about 1 cup diced) and sauteed them along with the garlic and also 1 tbsp. cumin (freshly roasted and ground) and 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper. I then added the chicken salt and pepper rice and reserved chicken water. I added the cilantro towards the end of cooking and just heated it through so that it didn't get diluted or turn that off color. I also just added the thawed peas at this point I see no point in cooking them to death. Perfecto!",
