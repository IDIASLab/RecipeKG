Canned peas are OK but she uses frozen-they cook in minutes. We do not use onions it will take a strong overpowering onion smell and taste especially if you're planning to keep the leftovers for a while in the fridge. Best if chilled over night to let the flavors blend:you can really taste the difference. Store in air tight containers and it will last for a week in the fridge. (DOES NOT freeze well) Great as a sandwich spread or side dish. your favorite chicken wing or fried chicken dish will go well with it.:)--For those who rated the recipe without reading the directions: tomatoes are NOT used in the recipe they are only the garnish--",

                "reviewBody": "Olivier Salad is called \"Salad Olivier\" in Iran and the version that I learned has grated carrots (optional but no tomatoes except as a side platter). Iranian cooks typically boil chicken (I use bone-in chicken breasts) to cook it (creating very tender chicken and a delicious leftover stock) and shred the cooked soft-boiled chicken with a fork (rather than chop it finely). Also they grate their potatoes and hard-boiled eggs (as in this recipe) instead of mash them simply because they generally do not have potato mashers in their market. Iranian cooks very commonly decorate the \"mayonnaise topping\" with salad ingredients (see the photos). I like to make this salad very rich with a lot of eggs and chicken so that it is a cross between a potato egg and chicken salad to make it more filling (the very rich version is my version: not an authentic version). In Iran Salad Olivier is commonly served with side platters of pita bread and thinly-sliced tomatoes as a meal. The pita bread may be cut in eighths so it can be used as a kind of \"salad holder\" as it is being eaten usually with tomatoes. I like to take Salad Olivier to potlucks: it has a beautiful presentation! I tell my friends that it is my \"Persian Potato Salad.\" After Christmas I sometimes make a turkey version of this salad (not authentic) with my usual leftovers (turkey potatoes deviled eggs and pickles). Salad Olivier tastes best if the filling (no mayonnaise topping) is made a day ahead.",
