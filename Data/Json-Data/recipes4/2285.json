I made it per the recipe without changing a thing.\n  All I can say is this is the most moist, tasty roast we have ever had.  Husband was a bit worried when I told him pineapple and tomato, but after we started eating it for dinner he changed his mind. Over and over he told me to make sure I dont' loose this recipe.  It was delicious! \n  I must tell you also, that 1/2 way through the cooking process we had an emergency and had to leave for 3.5 hours.  I was then worried, but it was so tender and juicy it didn't hurt it at all.  I browned the roast and baked it in my cast iron(Le Cruset) pan and it worked beautifully.  Make this one without reservation!  A+A+A+  \nBecause I can't give the recipe more than 5 stars I give it several A+'s.",

I browned the roast according the recipe and then placed it into a crock pot.  I also took the sliced onion and sauteed them in the pan I browned the roast.  As they softened, they soaked up the juices and brown bits in the pan.  I then scraped it all into the crock pot.  Adding the tomatoes and pineapple I didn't think there was enough liquid.  I then added 1 cup of a dry white wine.  Put the crock pot on low and left it for 8 hours.  I came back and the pork was just falling apart tender.  Instead of thickening the juices, I took my immersion blender  to the crock pot and whizzed up the tomatoes, pineapple and onion in the juices.  It made a  nice thick tasty sauce.  The roast was quite moist.  I served it with rice.  The sauce was great over the pork and rice.",
