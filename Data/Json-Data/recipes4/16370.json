My mom who is Mexican would make this often when I was younger, only she would use fresh tomatoes and cook half an onion with the rice. Well, tomatoes are pretty expensive so I love how  regular canned tomato sauce works just as well, saves you on time and money;). Besides cooking the onion in the rice, the only other changes I made was cutting way back on the oil and adding some salt and cumin...yum!",

I do think it was a tad 'greasy' but it wasn't too much so. Mine also took longer than 15 mins. to cook which was not a big deal. This does need salt IMO. I just used it to taste. All in all it was a basic simple rice which was what I was looking for. I would make it again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

The flavor was pretty decent too we're southern California people who have moved east and are not used to the tex-mex stuff that they pass off as mexican food around here so I cook a ton now. This was a super quick side to go along with some carnitas enchiladas. As for the \"sludge\" some other reviewers had if you mix it in the hot oil before adding the rice you start with something like a roux and incorporates very well. All in all a quick convenient and tasty side dish. Thanks so much!",

It has a nice savory flavor without hot spices. I thought maybe 1/4 cup was too much oil so I started with half that amount but when I added the powders it soaked it all up and I needed the rest. It wasn't oily when it was done either. Chicken broth came in a 14 oz can and I measured out 1.5 cups but ended up using the rest. The rice wasn't quite tender without it maybe because I used silver pearl (medium grain) rice. It went great with chicken enchiladas. I will definitely make this again.",
