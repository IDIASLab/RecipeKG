Otherwise, the casserole would have been very flat in an 8x8 dish.  I used crumbled bacon instead of ham, and with the butter and cheese, the casserole was a bit greasy so next time I would cut down on the butter a bit.  Would also possibly add some diced onions for extra flavor.  Overall, a very easy and tasty recipe.  WILL make again!\r\n\r\n***UPDATE***Made again without butter (coated croutons with butter flavored cooking spray).  Tasted just as good but a lot less greasy.  Also rolled the crumbled bacon in paper towel to remove some grease.",

I've even tried baking it immediately after preparing it, as opposed to letting it sit for a while, and it turned out just as good. I've also used ripped up hamburger bun pieces instead of croutons and that worked fine too. I now cut down on the amount of butter as previous reviewers suggested and the casserole is much less greasy. Oh yes, I also use 5 eggs and a tad more milk to fill the pan a bit more, but the casserole fluffs up a bit while baking. Thanks for the great recipe!",

The boyfriend actually commented on how tasty it was and he's not into eggs! I made it as stated except had no croutons so I just cut up a piece of toast. Nommy! UPDATE: This time I am trying to clean out the fridge so I added some cottage cheese half a green pepper a chopped roma tomato a little spinach and some basil. Used toast again and had white cheddar on hand. Popped it in the fridge about 4 pm and threw it in the oven at 6:45. Took about an hour to cook with all the extra stuff-and I had to dump out a LOT of extra grease-but turned out great! Much richer with the cottage cheese.",
