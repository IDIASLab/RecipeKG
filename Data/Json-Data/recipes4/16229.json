        "description": "Mild curry dish popular in Korea, includes ingredients you can find in your local grocery store and Korean/Asian market. The 'Ottogi' version of the curry simply leaves out the meat, making this a great dish for vegetarians. Feel free to add bell peppers. It is important to note that the curry powder used in this recipe is a pre-made mixture and not regular curry powder you can buy in every supermarket. I personally use Assi brand Korean products in my kitchen. For this recipe, I used 'Assi curry powder, mild-hot.' Serve over rice.",

Thanks to the other review  that the Korean curry powder contains a thickening agent, I added my curry powder (no thickening agent) to the pot when I added water and vegetable base. Gave it some time to absorb into veggies.  Used 2 Tbsp of cornstarch to thicken . \nI tried  2 Tbsp of curry powder but might use a little less next time.  It was good and enjoyed it.",

So I substituted 1 tbsp. Mild Curry Powder from allrecipes and 2 tbsp flour. We thought it was good but a little bland as we are used to hotter curries. I will make this again but add 2 or more tbsp. of mild curry powder next time.",
