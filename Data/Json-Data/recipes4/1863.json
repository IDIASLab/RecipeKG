I used turkey Italian sausage. I also sauteed sliced button and cremini mushrooms minced garlic and mixed them with the sausage and alfredo sauce. Instead of extra jarred sauce I used an equal amount of milk and 1 TB unsalted butter/flour roux. I also replaced the Cheddar with mozz and I used fresh spinach wilted squeezed of water and chopped mixed in with the cheeses. I baked 35 min with the foil on 10 min with the foil off to brown the cheese on top. Because of the saltiness I think next time I'll use 1/2 sausage 1/2 ground beef or turkey. Also I'll add a little ground nutmeg to the alfredo...",
