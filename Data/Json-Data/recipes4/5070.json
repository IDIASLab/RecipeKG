Also used jalapeno slices in a jar, as I had none fresh. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and pre-baked the mushrooms stem side down in the oven for 5-10 minutes and then drained them on paper towels to get the excess moisture out, before filling. This helped quite a bit to maintain a wonderful texture to the mushrooms without them getting mushy. Make these.....NOW!!!",
