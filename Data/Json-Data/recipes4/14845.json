If you prefer a pasta sauce that is not so chunky, process artichokes in food processor. Instead of a 1/2 cup of water use 1 cup water or add a second jar of Alfredo sauce.",

This was cheesy and def. could be cut back if you are watching your fat content or just don't want it too cheesy. I also added some fresh cut up turkey for a one stop meal. Served over Whole Wheat Pasta it was a good meal and tasted delicious. This really could be used as a dip also actually I tried it with a matzo cracker and it was wonderful.",

I used frozen spinach drained well and after running that in food processor put in the artichoke hearts for a few turns rather than chopping by hand which worked well. Definitely oooey gooey and probably really fattening but hey you've gotta live. Used low fat cream cheese and probably will try with low fat versions of other cheeses next time but there will definitely be a next time!",
