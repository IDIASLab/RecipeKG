I also used vodka instead of marsala wine because vodka was what I had. It turned out really good. Vermicelli was a little fine for the beef I would suggest linguine or fetuchine. I also would suggest simmering the meat for about 45 minutes I only did it for 15-20 minutes and it wasn't that tender. Good though and the kids liked the pink sauce.",

I would change the part of the recipe stating to add wine and spices THEN the meat; I think browning the beef gives off more flavor than \"braising\" which will happen if you add liquid (the wine) first. It took my beef tips about 1-1/2 hours simmering to tenderize which is probably typical. Different and tasty but not something we would make often. I made it low carb with \"Bella Vista\" low carb (YUM) spaghetti sauce and homemade heavy-cream alfredo and served with just a nice spring mix salad.",
