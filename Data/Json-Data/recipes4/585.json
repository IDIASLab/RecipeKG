As others have stated, I have also used sausage, chopped green bell peppers or a jar of drained diced pimentos.  If I'm REALLY lazy but my family is begging for some breakfast, I'll used a package of frozen hashbrowns instead and add the eggs once the hasbrowns are done and when the eggs are almost done, I'll add the bacon or sausage, and other veggies then.  If you flip carefully (for even cooking), you can practically cut out pizza-like slices right from your pan to serve. A different spin to an omlette! Thanks LaDonna!",

I liked that it only dirtied 1 skillet. I put the diced potatoes in the microwave for a couple of minutes to partially cook them while the bacon was cooking to reduce cook time on the stovetop. My guys both said although they liked this they preferred all their stuff separate (hash browns scrambled eggs with cheese and bacon). I loved this just as it is though and would have given this 5 stars b/c I'm a southern gal and this is down home southern cookin' for sure! I only had to make one change and that was to add a smidge of minced garlic and a pinch of kosher salt instead of the garlic salt. I only used enough bacon grease to coat the potatoes heavily and not all that was reserved. I did add 1 more potato 2 slices bacon and 2 more eggs to feed 3 of us. It made enough for 4. Thanks LaDonna for a great meal.",

I doubled the recipe and found that the 1/4 tsp of salt & pepper did hardly anything for the skillet. I also omitted the bacon (didn't have any on hand and I'm a vegetarian). I used rosemary olive oil to fry up the potatoes instead of the bacon grease. It made my house smell great! I served it with english muffins. It was an overall very yummy and satisfying dish.
