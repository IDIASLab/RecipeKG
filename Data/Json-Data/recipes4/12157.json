Next time I'll use either all white wine or all brandy because the red wine made the onions an interesting shade that wasn't too appealing. I will also peel the potatoes with a potato peeler cube and boil before mashing as my potatoes were so big the outside was mush but the insides were still raw when boiled whole. I added an extra tablespoon of brandy in at the end to really pop the flavor out. Final result is pretty good.",
