I submitted this recipe - just to clarify, I use two packages of the King Hawaiian Sweet dinner rolls (in the orange bag, remove the cardboard tray it comes in).  You can just slice the tops off all at once and spread the beef mixture on the \"bottoms\".  Make sure to spray the foil with Pam so they don't stick.  I also don't put them on a cookie sheet, just wrap the whole thing in foil and pop in the oven, this prevents the bottoms from burning against the hot cookie sheet and keeps the buns soft.  Make sure to drain the grease and let the beef mixture cool a bit before adding mayo and cheese so it doesn't separate and get too oily.  These are always the hit of the party!  Tastes just like White Castles!",

The only addition I made to the recipe that continues to result in men and women asking for my recipe is: I add a special butter sauce to the top, borrowed from another great recipe.  Here it is:  2 tbsp minced onion flakes, 1 tbsp worchestershire sauce, 1 tbsp Dijon or Spicey Mustard (not the regular yellow), 1/2 cup melted butter.  You melt these together and brush ontop of the buns just before you put in the oven to bake.  The men who have eaten this, always ask for the recipe!",

I thought the meat mixture would be more consistant doing it that way...and it would take the guess work out of how much meat goes on a package of rolls...I rated it 4 stars because of changes I made.  I usually ALWAYS make the recipe exactly as stated the first time around, but couldn't on this one.  The recipe doesn't call for draining the ground beef after it is cooked, which I felt needed to be done.  I think it would be too greasy otherwise.  I followed the recipe other than draining the grease and adding a pickle to the burger before I baked it.  I also followed the review from the Dena who posted the recipe, i.e. not using a baking pan and waiting for the meat to cool before adding the mayo/cheese also, I used Hawaiian King rolls as suggested.  Thank you SO much for a fabulous recipe!  I will definitely make it again and again!",

The next day, I threw the meat mix in the microwave for a couple of minutes while I got the cheese and mayo (among other party fixings) ready to go.  Mixed everything up, put it on the rolls and popped in the oven.  My husband raved--said it was way better than Krystal burgers!

Other than that, I followed the recipe. These are so close to White Castle burgers and even better, you can make tweaks to make them healthier, like using wheat buns. If you're worried about how much onion soup mix you're using, just add less at first and more to taste after the meat has cooked. Adding a little water can help the meat soak it up. I will definitely be making these again. ",
