I \"scaled down\" the number of servings from 9 to 4...very handy tool I might add. When this recipe is scaled down to make 4 servings it says to add 7/8 of a clove of garlic. Well I misunderstood that and added 7 or eight cloves of garlic to the dish. I love a lot of garlic so I didn't mind it but my poor hubby had to try to choke it down not to hurt my feelings! I ended up throwing out the plastic container I'd stored the leftovers in because I couldn't get the garlic smell out of it. I have made the dish since and we love it...now I put 2 whole cloves in for 4 servings.",

I made the same amount of sauce for two chicken breasts and boy am I glad that I did.  I have a few additional changes I will make next time though.  First, I would cube and brown the chicken first.  It is a little anemic as is.  I will also try adding some parsley or paprika to give the sauce a little color.  This dish, will however get made again.  I even used low fat cream of mushroom and fat free cream cheese and am still giving it this rave review.  You really need to try it.",

Used only 1 lb chicken cream of chicken instead of mushroom added a can of mushrooms a couple of diced carrots some green pepper and extra garlic. Served it over biscuits. Yum!

I've made it a bunch of times, even forgot to use sour cream once, it was still great.\r\nJust a tip, microwave the cream cheese for about 30 seconds, it will soften and its much easier to mix into the mushroom soup.  Personally though, little bits of cream cheese don't bother me, but softened cream cheese is much easier to work with.  And of course, double the garlic!  Delicious!!!",

I doubled the amount of chicken used Healthy Request cream of chicken (I found this in the way back of my cupboard) reduced fat sour cream and reduced fat cream cheese. Before making this I did read through some of the reviews and decided to brown the meat before adding it to the sauce and I also sauteed half of an onion with the garlic in a little of the leftover EVOO from browning the chicken. I added a big glug of dry white wine to thin out the sauce a bit and sprinkled in some homemade italian seasoning. I'm glad I read through the reviews because I don't think it would have been AS good if I hadn't. Plus it would have been way too much sauce and not enough meat for my boys if I hadn't added more. I served this with whole wheat angel hair pasta and steamed broccoli. This recipe saved my behind and helped me rid my cupboard of one more canned soup. My boys inhaled this. NOTE: I think this would make a good filling for Chicken/Turkey Pot Pie if it was thinned down a bit with chicken broth.",
