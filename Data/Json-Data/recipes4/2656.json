I added a little extra cheddar, and a few slices of american to give it more of a cheeseburger taste. It also made it a little creamier. The cooking time was too long, I burnt my first batch. Then I followed the directions on the wrap package, the rest came out fine. Oh, and I left out the pickles because hubby doesn't like them. We dipped in fry sauce. (ketchup and mayo) Next time we will be trying mushroom swiss burger egg rolls. :) ",

I made half of it the way it was written and for the other half I used the meat, cooked and crumbled bacon, onion, bbq sauce and cheddar cheese.  One pound of meat definitely is not enough to use all of the egg roll wrappers, but it easily fed my family.  Like someone else suggested, I thought it wasn't enough oil, but I just let them cook on one side and then flipped them.  It was less than 4-5 minutes on each side, but just watch them and you'll be fine.  I'm definitely making these again.",
