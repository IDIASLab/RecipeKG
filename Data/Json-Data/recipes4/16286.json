I also threw in a bouillon cube along with vegetable broth, I pureed some of the soup and used coconut milk instead of evaporated milk. I omitted the flour hoping that pureeing would make it thick enough, but I think I must have added too much water. The soup is still flavorful and the texture is fine,  just not thick. I'll make this again. The coconut gives it depth! Thanks for sharing!",
