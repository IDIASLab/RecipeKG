It still made a ton!\" I kept the 1 lb. of ground beef but halved everything else along with using some garden jalapenos instead of canned and we liked it but found that there were too many competing flavors in its ingredient list. No question it was a tasty chili but one that I would make some adjustments to when making again such as reducing if not eliminating some of the seasonings.",
