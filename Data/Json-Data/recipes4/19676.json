I'm not a fan of  cod fish unless it's beer battered and fried, but this came out great!\nI followed 99% of the recipe as I did not have and could not find fish bouillon cubes, so I used chicken bouillon instead. I also used panko breadcrumbs which held up well as I reserved a uncooked portion of fish for the next day and the topping was still crunchy when it was baked.  This is a must try!",
