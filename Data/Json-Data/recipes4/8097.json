I then cut off each end and cut the rest into 4, ending up with 4 rounds.  I salted them and let sit 15 minutes allowing water to escape.   I then baked them for one hour and followed the recipe.    Try this not cutting the squash lengthwise.   You will get much longer strands of the spaghetti as the strands grow around and not lengthwise   This is a  keeper.",

It's still pretty watery, even with changes.\" First time I made this I followed the recipe and it had way too much liquid when pulled from the oven; slotted spoon and splashes abound. Made it again, reducing the chicken broth to 1/2 c. and increasing the tomato paste to the full can, and while the sauce was nice and thick and still as tasty, the spaghetti squash itself just releases too much liquid on its own. It is a delicious dish, but I think it's better to just spoon the sausage sauce over the spaghetti squash rather than mixing it all together and putting it into the oven.",
