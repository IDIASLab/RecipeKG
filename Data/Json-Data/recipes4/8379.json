Couldn't find Barolo, Barbaresco, or anything from the Piedmont  region and used a mid-range Pinot Noir instead. Alternative red wines to choose from for use in this dish if not Pinot Noir could be Cab, Shiraz, Malbec...to name a few. Cooking time was spot on...took about 2.5 hours total when the meat could be easily shredded with a fork. Followed entire recipe as written with no issues. Served along with polenta and side garden salad. Thanks for sharing the recipe and providing a lovely new way for us to make this cut of beef! --Updated review on 4.7.18 to remove recommendation of possibly using a zinfandel in this recipe.",
