Try making a meat loaf sandwich out of them too.",

The marriage of flavors here were delicious and my husband proclaimed it his favorite meatloaf ever. I used 2lbs of ground beef and there was enough meat to fill all 6 large muffin tins and 6 regular sized muffin tins - which were perfect sized for the kids. Both muffin trays cooked  together in the oven for the 30 minutes specified in the recipe. We will be making this one again very soon!!",

I followed the recipe to a \"T\", though I did sub gorgonzola for blue because I was too lazy to backtrack in the grocery store.  I ended up with a fairly rough chop on the onions and I'm glad I was too lazy to get a finer dice because I enjoyed the onion in larger chunks.  When I make these again (and I will!), I will add more spinach and maybe some shredded carrots, too, just to pack in some more nutrients.  Thanks for making me not hate meatloaf!",

I used fresh spinach and onion (both locally organically grown!) Progresso Italian-style bread crumbs and Athenos Blue Cheese Crumbles. I followed the recipe exactly. I was able to fill 12 regular muffin cups about 80%-90% full and cooked it for about 20 minutes instead of the 30 in the recipe. I broke the center one in half and it was cooked through. Normally my husband will eat what I cook and say yeah it's ok. But he ate 2 muffins for supper took 2 to work (graveyard shift) and ate them this morning and ate another 2 for supper tonight. And yes there were other things he could have had for supper. So I'm gonna say they're winners! Not only did my picky husband like them but my 5-year old ate 2 of them (with his hands 'cause \"it's funner that way\") dipping them in ketchup instead of putting the ketchup on top. WAY less mess than normal meatloaf that way! I think this is going to become a regular meal at our house!",
