I thought they were incredibly quick and easy to mix up and the resulting biscuit was soft and tender in the inside and appealingly crackly on the top.  I loved them, even tho' I tasted no Sriracha.  Hubs liked them too, calling them \"pleasantly warm\" with the Sriracha and admitting those with a higher heat tolerance may want to add more. Bottom line, these are an easy, tasty biscuit, worth making over again and again.",

I would suggest mixing it with the half and half before mixing it all together if you prefer total incorporation. Either way - don't just sit there - go make some!",

Rather than melt butter and brush on with salt afterward I placed a pat of salted butter on each biscuit fresh from the oven. I had leftovers and sealed them in a baggie once cool. The leftovers were enjoyed the following morning. A quick 15 seconds in the microwave turned out still-moist and even more flavorful biscuits. Thank you for this recipe!",
