I think I will cover the pan in the oven for 25 minutes then remove the cover and cooked an additional 10 or 15 minutes. It sounds delicious - Serbians rock!",

My expectations were modest mostly due to the lack of seasonings in this casserole (which according to Wikipedia is typical for Serbian cooking). But wow. This casserole is amazing! The ingredients themselves provide ample flavor. The only changes I made were cooking it entirely on the stovetop instead of baking it using a pork chop instead of pork hocks and using a good-quality chicken stock instead of broth. I'll definitely make this again--in fact I'm going to get up and do that right now!",
