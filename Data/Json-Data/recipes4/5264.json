This recipe which I made last night, with one small deviation, is the answer to my prayers for a great \"lasagne.\".  The eggplant makes a wonderful substitute for lasagne noodles.   I added a palmful of Italian seasoning.  Shredded Parmesan cheese to top of the richness.  The recipe is a wonderful base recipe.  We didn't miss the noodles at all.  This is great for gluten free diets also.  Thanks for sharing!",

It needed more sauce (as someone else also mentioned). So I had to add more. The other change I made was to use a different shredded cheese. I opted for an Italian 5 cheese blend as husband doesn't care for cheddar. It was a nice lasagna. However the eggplant did not get cooked. (even with increasing the cooking time) I sliced it thin too. Next time I may either cube it and cook with the beef and sauce or may pan fry it slightly before baking.",
