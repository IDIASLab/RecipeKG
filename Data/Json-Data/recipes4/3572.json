After browning the sausage I did transfer it to a slow cooker on low a few hours before the party, I think it helped all the flavors blend well. It wasn't hot enough for me with just the 2 dashes of hot sauce so I added about 6-8 dashes and it was awesome. This recipe is a keeper for the perfect appetizer for parties.",

Was sweet yet the after effects you could feel the Heat, served over white rice and was a homerun with family, Thank You for the Recipe",

The result was a confusing mix of flavours that really didn't taste like they should have gone together (and I'm usually one who appreciates savoury-sweet dishes). I feel that adding a bit of cornstarch with water could have helped the sauce be more substantial but it wouldn't have saved the dish. It's edible but that's about all I can say for it. I'll finish the leftovers because I can't stand to waste that much food but I definitely won't be making this again.",
