I have made it with both turkey and chicken, and have to admit the turkey is a little better.  But I love being able to just drop the raw meat into the stew, no other prep.  I also may try adding some peas.  i have a large family, so I double this a use a few extra potatoes.  It is still quick, easy and a healthy dinner to put on the table.  I like how it gives you that wonderful feeling of a filling stew on a cold night, but it is also low fat and healthy.",

This year I made the Michiganer's Turkey from this site and used left over white and dark meat from it. I also made quite a few substitutions and additions: Veggies - 3 red potatoes frozen corn frozen peas and frozen baby carrots. Spices - In addition to the 1/4 tsp. marjoram I used 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning 1 tsp. dried basil 1 tsp. onion powder (because i didn't have any onions!) 1 tsp fresh parsley 1 clove of fresh garlic 1 bay leaf and fresh ground pepper to taste. The flavour was excellent and exactly what I had hoped for. This recipe is good made as is but it's better as a base recipe to add your own personal flavourings to. With additions a 5/5 without additions a 4/5. Serve with fluffy biscuits recipe from this site - the perfect accompaniment!",

I also used two tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat instead of butter.  I recommend adding in extra carrots, peppers and celery, if you like vegetables.
