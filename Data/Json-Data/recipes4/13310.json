I did use whole wheat flour; in fact I used all whole wheat flour as the lavash I typically buy and enjoy is whole grain. My lavash turned out very nutty and crunchy. Although I'm eating it plain right now I see it as an excellent partner for cheese. To Jellylava who had trouble with it sticking when stacked I would suggest using wax paper to separate the lavash pieces. This ought to stop the sticking problem. Although you're probably doing this make sure you flour your rolling pin and work space too. By the way I made a half recipe and it turned out fine.",

I was stunned at how thin these would roll out I dusted the top with Kosher salt and used a fork to dock them all over prior to baking. I tried baking on pizza stone and also in a heated ungreased half sheet pan. I preferred the half sheet pan my pizza stone has charred semolina/cornmeal on it and the bread rounds picked up these bits. The next day I put them in a low oven (250) for a couple of minutes to warm them - and they were even better than fresh out of the oven.",

I couldn't keep up with the rolling in order to get them into the oven and so I ended up rolling the rest of the dough and then turning the oven back on - only the last 10 or so were usable as they had stuck together. I don't know whether to oil them or flour them more to keep them separate and I don't have enough space to lay them all out while waiting so that is why I stacked them. If I try these again I will experiment with using my pasta machine to do the rolling and then cut off sections to bake. In any case it was fun trying and as I said they are delicious.

My advise: make sure you have a large amount of counter space for rolling out and make sure your counter is cool (not warm). Edited to add: I tried these again for Thanksgiving with only all-purpose flour... they never rose! I do not think the flour would have made that much of a difference.
