Salt is added at this step as well.  Instead of adding plain tomatoes in and jalepenos, I switched it to one (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers - or green peppers - with juice (or you can sub in 1/2 regular diced tomatoes and 1/2 jalepeno for less kick).  I also don't just pour them in, I actually puree it up before pouring it into the skillet.  I add 2 large white onions to this recipe as well, because the onions (if you use just one) can get lost in this recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Definitely a keeper!",

If you are using fresh spices about 2 hrs...if you are using dried then 3..I always do this when I am slow cooking..and I always get the flavor of what my dish is suppose to taste like. :)\nHOPE THIS HELPS!!",

Instead of curry powder, I did 1/2 tablespoon of red curry paste and 1/2 tablespoon of roasted red chili paste, omitted the jalepenos and it was still plenty spicy. I skipped the first stovetop step entirely. Just put everything in the crockpot and let it cook for nearly 10 hours on low. The beef practically shredded itself. We ate it over basmati rice to which I added turmeric and black pepper for color. Highly reccomended.",

I totally skipped the browning stage and just tossed the onion and the beef in the slow cooker then mixed up the rest of the ingredients in a bowl and poured it over the meat. I didn't use a jalapeno to save time and simply used a jar of diced tomatoes with green chilies in it. I also added more curry powder and a little cumin nutmeg and red pepper to suit our love for strong flavor and spiciness. When it was all done I fished the meat out and thickened the juices with some xanthum powder (availible in your local health food store). I served it with some sauted veggies. Very tastey!",
