I did brown my pork chops then cooked them for 5 hours on low but I think they would have been done in 4. I sauteed the mushrooms (used two containers of fresh because I like them) onion 3 cloves of garlic (once clove would never be enough for me) olive oil and a half cup more of marsala until the onions were translucent. Then I added that to the pot the last hour. My husband and I LOVED it. I served it with roasted red potatoes seasoned with rosemary olive oil salt and pepper. Super yummy but I changed the proportions of the ingredients and cooking method so only 4 stars.",

I took several reviewers' suggestions -- saute onions mushrooms garlic and add low-sodium beef broth -- they made good sense. But I was surprised by the amount of flour I had left over after dredging 8 boneless chops; I threw away about 3/4 cup seasoned flour. No wonder so many said the seasoning seemed non-existant. I think there was plenty of seasoning but next time I'll mix it in 1/4 cup flour -- that should be plenty and it will perk up the spice level. Thank you for the recipe D-",

I made this exactly as instructed - and it was wonderful!
