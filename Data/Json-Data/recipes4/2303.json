I couldn't even imagine trying to frost a layer cake with it like this.  So, I decided to chalk that cake up to experience and made another.  This time I used a heaping cup of Jif peanut butter (probably around 1 1/4 cups), 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and 3 T of heavy cream.  I beat the room temperature butter and the room temperature peanut butter for several minutes until I could not see any butter at all in the mixture and it seemed very creamy.  Then I gradually added the powdered sugar and when it was well-blended, I added the 3 T of heavy cream and then put it on #6 on my KitchenAid mixer and let it go for 3-4 minutes.  This time it was MUCH easier to spread and tastes great!!",

Naturally you wouldn't expect any kind of peanut butter frosting to spread as pretty as butter cream and still taste like peanut butter, this is \"peanut butter\" we're talking about after all. My cake tasted fabulous and looked fabulous. It is not anything like a paste, if you follow the recipe correctly, and add milk \"as needed\" like it says and whip it long enough, its perfect. Major pet peeve....someone leaving a review when clearly they did not follow the recipe like it is written, how can you review this recipe if you didn't follow it? This went in my GOLDEN RECIPE BOOK. Frosted brownies with it, oh la la, Loved it!!",

If they get too grainy and hard after u added in 3 tablespoons milk, stop adding. Instead, put ur bowl into microwave on high for 30 sec, take out and stir. This will solve the problem.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written, no alterations necessary.  I made sure my butter was softened (not just room temperature) and I used Jiff's Creamy PB with No Added Sugar;  the two whipped together beautifully in about a minute (and I just own a bottom-barrel Black & Decker hand-held mixer);  then I added the powdered sugar a half-cup at a time, whipping as I went;  I made sure to add in 1 Tbl milk between each sugar-addition so that I could judge moisture-spreadability ratio.  It kept wonderfully fluffy and spreadable for the hour and a half that I used it, then put the remainder in the fridge.  It does harden in the fridge, but gently microwaving it with a tablespoon or two or milk and then stirring returns it to its original malleability.  I liked this recipe so well, I made an additional batch substituting Nutella for the peanut butter--it tasted incredible!  ",
