I didn't find them to be oily but with that being said the last time I made them I used another recipe that packed a bit more flavor. However, the other recipe I use calls for a ton of crushed red pepper which the kiddos don't enjoy so I guess what I'm saying is this a fantastic starter recipe. If you like more garlic add it, onion throw it in, into more dill have at it! I give this one 5 stars based on the fact that its simple and doesn't \"twist\" your arm to add things that do not suit your family for the sake of staying true to the recipe. Great snack, dirt cheap,  and easily tailored! Thanks for the tasty submission =)",

They will disappear very quickly and everyone will ask for the recipe. If you have leftovers just save them in a plastic bag and they stay crispy for a long time.",

I agree with another reviewer. The measurement for the oil is too much. I use approx 1/2 - 2/3 cup of canola oil. (You stop actually measuring when you make them so often) I will add my crackers to a large Tupperware bowl and then pour the mixture over the crackers. I cover the bowl and then turn the bowl upside down and kind of swirl the bowl in a circular motion once or twice so the crackers do not break. I also recommend flipping the bowl over once every 30 minutes or so. This helps the mixture evenly coat the crackers.",
