I followed the recipe, with the addition of a teaspoon of onion powder, sea salt, and ground white pepper.  I rolled them the way my grandmother did, which is to portion them out (16-18 per recipe), using hands, roll each portion into a hotdog-like shape, then with a rolling pin, roll out into a long, thin rectangle, about 1/8\" thick.  Brush with oil, sprinkle on green onions, and roll into cigar lengthwise.  Next, take one end and begin coiling the cigar into a patty (like how a snake coils itself), and tuck the end tail under.  Next, roll flat with rolling pin, again, 1/8\" thick.  I like to make two batches at a time, and freeze them, with parchment paper inbetween.  No need to defrost when pan frying, just lower the temp a bit, and cook a bit longer.  Sprinkle with salt and serve with hoisin sauce.  Enjoy!",

Green onion cakes are meant to be flat..the purpose of letting the dough rest is just to develop the gluten and make the cake more tender when fried. These cakes are typically served as appetizers in Asian restaurants. They are meant to be somewhat plain...I brush mine with sesame oil and sprinkle some salt when doing the layer of chopped gr. onions. The key is to serve them with a dipping sauce....my favorite is soy sauce mixed with a little bit of super hot red chili sauce (you know the kind with the bright green lid in the Asian cooking aisle). They are meant to be enjoyed with sauce thus they are kinda plain.",

A few notes...\n\n* You will need 2 bunches of green onions unless yours are very large\n* No need to let the dough rest. really, trust me.\n* For more flavour, use sesame oil both in cooking and in the dough, or half and half with vegetable oil.\n* LESS IS MORE WHEN IT COMES TO OIL! Add 2 or 3 drops to the pan before each batch of cakes you fry, not all at once in the beginning. We're not deep frying them, after all.\n* Use sea salt.\n* Roll the dough out long, roll like a cigar, coil like a snake, then roll flat. Thinner is better.\n* Eat them hot. (drools)\n\n* Thank you so much for this recipe!",
