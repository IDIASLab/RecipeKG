I don't eat meat so I left out the ground turkey. I followed the recipe as written but found the sauce to be rather thick so I added an additional 2 cups of water. The sauce is still on the thicker side but the water helped to make it the perfect consistency. This recipe does have a bite to it with the spices be forewarned if that is not your thing! I absolutely love the fresh butternut squash black beans and southwest corn! This is a recipe I will make again!",

Very good flavor and I'll definitely make it again. Some of the family like it spicier so I served it with optional hot sauce.",

I cut back the chili powder and added a teaspoon of turmeric. I used half of a whole butternut squash which I cut in half and roasted face down on cookie sheet at 350 for 45 minutes. After it cooled I removed skin and cut into chunks which I added near the end. I think this helped the enhance the flavor of the squash although it did take a bit longer. Turned out great!",
