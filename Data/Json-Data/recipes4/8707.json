I can imagine that with taco sauce it would give it a totally different flavor (and texture, as taco sauce isn't as thick :))\nI don't feel like I can give this a star rating because I submitted the recipe - but I think it's delicious, and allrecipes makes you give a rating, so 5 stars :)  I usually add a little bit of minced garlic to the mix, as well, and extra chili sauce (it tends to fall apart with too much, though, so watch out :)).  The chili sauce is good even with just beef (or even ground turkey) if you don't have sausage.  Be careful not to overcook, though, because the meat will stay red due to the sauce.  Use a meat thermometer if you want to make sure it's done, or just grill as you would any other burger.",

With the help of the Chili Sauce, the burgers were unbelievably moist and I got rave reviews.  Thanks for the recipe - I will make this again and again!",
