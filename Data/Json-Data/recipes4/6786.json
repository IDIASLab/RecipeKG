I used November! garden Jalapenos and they were on the small side so I cut the bacon in thirds, just enough to go round and secure with toothpick and I also cooked them longer so the bacon was crisp but boy were they GOOD! This a great little snack to add to other little snacks that you can make ahead of time and serve for company. I NEVER write reviews butyou really have to try these. So much better than the fried poppers.",

Use a spoon and remove all the \"light green/white\" lines.  This is where the heat is.\n2) If your cheese is \"melting out\" you didn't use cream cheese or not enough.  If you want to use just cheddar or another melty cheese, pre-cook the bacon so it is cooked but still limp, then reduce the cooking time in the oven.\n3) If you like crispy bacon...cooking timn is about 35 mins.\n4) Feel free to mix other things in with the cheese.  Some barbecue seasonings and garlic salt work well.",
