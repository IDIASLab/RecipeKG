I left out the kiwi but added oranges and used red grapefruit. I pre-plated the salad and before serving I put the seafood on top. I had extra seafood so I plated a large platter of salad and served the extra seafood on the side. I also doubled the dressing which is very tasty. My guests ate it all up! This is an elegant impressive and easy salad to serve only to your best friends and family!",
