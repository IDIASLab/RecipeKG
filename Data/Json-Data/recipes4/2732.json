First off I did not need a full quart of cream used under just 2 cups and about 1/2 cup chicken broth. Second all I needed to do is layer this add potatoes sprinkle with parm and butter some cream and broth and dot with butter sprinkle with cheddar and repeat layers I had 3 layers. This is so good I used a mandolin to get potatoes really thin. I will be making this again and again thanks.",

Preparing this was easy as was baking it in the oven. I seasoned the potatoes with black pepper and Hawaiian sea salt; layered the potatoes with more fresh shredded parmesan and less sharp cheddar cheese in the gratin dish and then poured the cream over the top. I placed the butter on top and baked as recipe instructed for one hour. This turned out to be a nice rich sauce with cheesy potatoes! This is definitely not diet food but a great side dish for our ham tonight. I served this with Creamy Sweet Corn and Glazed Ham also from this website. Very tasty.",
