It evokes memories of traditional holiday meals, while requiring much less preparation than a stuffed bird. I had hoped for the meat to be a bit moister, but I did not serve it with the suggested applesauce, electing instead to have broccoli and sweet potato sides. Perhaps the omission of a sauce was a poor decision. I also found it to be slightly salty for my taste, and do not recommend adding any additional salt as the bacon provided plenty. Would certainly try this recipe again.",

I seasoned it with salt, pepper, 1 teaspoon chicken seasoning.  I butterflied the tenderloin and pounded it to about 1/2 inch and then stuffed and rolled it.  My tenderloin was pretty small so I didn't add extra bread.  No bacon but but rolled prosciutto ham around the tenderloin.   It also looked much better since all the stuffing was rolled inside and looked nice when sliced.  The prosciutto ham might have been good in the stuffing instead.",

I only used half of what the recipe called for and it was still way too much. Had to add more bread to even it out. I also skipped the salt.  Between the poultry seasoning and the bacon, I thought the salt might be over kill. Came out perfect!  I will definitely make this again!",

I have a gas oven....I cooked at 375 for 30 minutes, flipped, them cooked for 15 minutes, flipped again then cooked for 15 minutes. Set to broil, then cooked for 5 minutes, flipped and cooked for 5 minutes, then removed from oven.  I set at a tilt for juices/bacon fat to run to one side and let rest for 20 minutes. It was tender and juice and the flavor was outstanding!!!",

We actually used up two old hamburger buns in place of the bread. I did not have poultry seasoning so I used about a tsp of seasoned salt and 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and some pepper. This was messy to make and a bit frustrating to get the bacon wrapped around without dumping out the stuffing but totally worth it. The pork was tender and flavorful. Great Sunday dinner.",
