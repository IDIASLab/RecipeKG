        "description": "Family Recipe, a staple once a year when fresh tuna was available in my area. It's pretty spicy, so it is generally served with boiled potatoes which are perfect for soaking up the sauce. The sauce is awesome and stands up to the very meaty fish. For some reason, long lost, my grandmother always asked for the darkest tuna steaks they had. She insisted they were better. Pretty sure my grandmother used lard for frying, my aunt says butter and oil do fine.  Any vegetable oil is fine if you don't buy you olive oil by the gallon. Plate the fish with some rice or potatoes (both if you are Portugues).",

I actually used it with steak and eggs(another Portuguese favorite) and it came out fantastic. One thing I thought that marinating the tuna was excessive since the sauce was already so strong. And for those of you that don't know what 'pimenta moida' is it's wet hot crushed red pepper that comes in a jar... It's critical to the recipe. A possible substitution could be hot crushed cherry peppers.",
