So I wound up squeezing the juice of 1 lime adding the melted butter and omitting the rum. I didn't measure the powdered sugar I just added a little at a time until it reached the consistency of a glaze. I liked the tartness of the glaze but I found it over powered the subtle taste of the mango. I will make this again but I will make sure that I have 2 ripe mangos 1 for the cake and 1 for the glaze.",

The cake to me didn't seem to taste much different from a regular yellow cake besides being a little more dense from the mango. The glaze was the best part. I only used a little under 1/2 Tablespoon of rum and that was more than enough. I surprisingly wasn't so crazy about the cake but everyone who had a piece absolutely loved it and has asked me to make it again already.",

No big deal but just be aware this might happen. Th big issue I had was the glaze. I was takeing this to church where kids were so I didnt know how well the small amount of rum taste would go over with them so I subbed that with an extra T of lime juice. Problem.. this still no where near a glaze.. was a dried powder with lumps. I had no more fresh lime but did have a bottle of lime juice in the fridge.. so I started adding.. more and more to get a glaze. It was very strong flavored as result but when eaten with the cake was quite good. Next time I make this.. I will use less sugar and instead of all the lime juice I'd use water or even coconut water would be nice. The adults liked this and with the tartness of my glaze I would say it was more suited for grownup tastes. For kids watch the amount of lime juice if you need to thin this out.. which I did",

But from the Previous reviews we changed it from using a yellow cake box mix to a French vanilla cake box mix and it made it much more moist and yummy! But, a lot of math was required because the 2 different cake mixes had different amounts. We also used more mangos and it gave it a lot of flavor. So in the end, we tapered with the recipe but if you want this amazingly moist and delicious cake.... USE THIS RECIPE!!!",
