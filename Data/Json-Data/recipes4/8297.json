It was the first time making them so reluctant to take them to work to share with others especially since I had to bake them almost 3x longer than indicated due to the oven issue. However everyone loved them! Co-worker asked for the recipe to make and she over baked them. Her family still loved them even with them nearly burnt. Truly a no fail recipe!",
