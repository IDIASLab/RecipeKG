Apparently he used to eat in when he was younger and hadn't seen it in years! Once he tasted it he said it wasn't quite like he remembered so that put me on the search for a pie he'd like. This one fit the bill--he took the whole pie home with him after having a piece for dessert! For people worried about the alcohol content you can buy alcohol free green creme de menthe at the grocery store which is what I did. I used the same amount called for in the recipe and added a splash of vodka since we wanted the alcohol but it is easily made alcohol free for those who prefer it that way.",

Two tips for success making it - 1) You must FREEZE the pie before serving it. The recipe states to \"chill\" it but it needs to be in the freezer to set. I froze mine overnight. 2) The food coloring is not necessary. The green from the creme de menth gives the pie the perfect \"mint\" green color.",

Does anyone know how to prevent the currdeling from happening again? because the filling tasted amazing before the textural change and I think it would have made a really good pie.",
