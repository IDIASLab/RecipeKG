Because garlic is good in almost everything I added three cloves of freshly chopped garlic when I sauteed the veggies; and because I was too lazy to make rice I added a handful of dry orzo to cook up as the soup simmered.  I used my immersion blender to slighly puree a small amount of the soup which gave an illusion of creaminess; but still left it very chunky.",

Truly an excellent base that can be changed up tons of different ways to suit your personal preferences.

It would be a good choice for someone wanting to eat lighter fare, and possibly wanting to reduce calorie intake. Essentially, this is a tasty broth with ample mushrooms.

Prepared the recipe as written, and in retrospect, wish we had adopted some of the changes others had made. We would probably not make this again unless there were dietary reasons to do so.",
