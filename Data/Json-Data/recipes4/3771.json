There were some things changed but not much. First I used Hot Italian Sausage with casings removed instead of Andouille. Browned that with some minced garlic and onion no butter or oil needed and drained the meat. I added cooked bacon and this was a great addition! Used skim milk and fat free half and half sprinkled cayenne then with some garlic cheesy bread you have an AWESOME dinner!! (The Hot sausage does add a little bit of a red greasy layer on top- wish I knew how to eliminate that but I don t think it is possible with this kind of sausage and that isn t changing bc we like spicy!!) My fianc\u00e9 begs for this now! Quick easy and delish!",

I always put double cream in all my cream soups. sometimes I substitute cabbage for spinach. or bacon for sausage I always fry my meats prior to adding to the soups , I then brown my  white flour in a frying pan mix it with some of the liquids pour it in the soup to thicken it up , this makes the soup really thick. YUM YUM    thank you for the great recipe.",
