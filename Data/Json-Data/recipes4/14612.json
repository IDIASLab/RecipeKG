They were all sugar-free which is all I have. I also found a quart-sized container of low-fat yogurt marked down to 1.50 because it was close to its pull-date. After I mixed everything together I tasted it and thought I'd like to increase the cherry flavor a little so I dumped in a packet of unsweetened cherry Kool-Ade and a bobble of vanilla extract. When these were half-frozen I threw in some blueberries and raspberries. I also sprayed the baking dish with some pan spray to make sure these came out of the dish easily. And they did. These were wonderful! A nice refreshing lo-cal treat that helps me get my dairy for the day. Thank you so much for the post Pepita I just love these things. I can't wait to try some other flavors!",

                "reviewBody": "Easy to follow recipe. Four cups yogurt = 32 oz container (knowing this will save you prep time). I used 2 cherry and 1 rasberry 3-oz box of regular jello. Wasn't sure how fluffy mix was suppose to be so used judgment and poured when it looked ready. Wasn't sure how mixture would freeze w/yogurt so rather than pour the whole batch into a 9x13-inch glass dish I used 1 plastic ice tray and 1 flat square storage container. I inserted popscile sticks into ice tray mix. Won't do that again - sticks or ice tray - too hard removing frozen mix. When I first took recipe from freezer I waited 10 not 15 minutes before biting into it - was very tart. Put 2 tsp of mix in bowl and let sit in room temp for 1-1/2 hrs while family went to dinner at a resturant. Came back and ate the yogurt. It was a bit softer had clear liquid forming in bottom of bowl. Yogurt tasted a bit sweeter then I prefer and consistency was more like \"junket \" a dessert Mom made when I was a youngster. If I make recipe again I will try using sugar-free jello in a different flavor. Suggestion: unless you plan to eat the whole recipe in one sitting you might consider putting mix in individual molds/bowls then freeze. Thanks for the recipe Pepita.",
