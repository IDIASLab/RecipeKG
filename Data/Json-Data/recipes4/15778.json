I tweaked the recipe for what I had at home. 1/2 mayo and 1/2 plain greek yogurt instead of vegan yogurt, honey instead of agave nectar, regular white vinegar, lemon juice (though I'm sure lime would be a little better), and I know it's weird, but I used the vinegar water from banana peppers instead of water to thin. I also added about a teaspoon and a half or so of sriracha! It tastes great and I'm sure after sitting over night it will taste even better tomorrow :) Thanks for sharing.",
