I've made them twice and they were great both times. paigeperski is right- it's better to mix the strawberry preserves and cream cheese before putting them in the cupcakes. Another modification that I made was to fill the cups about halfway with batter put in the cream cheese mix and then fill the cup the rest of the way with batter. Two problems (sort of) with this recipe though. 1st the batter is very thick and it only makes 15-18 muffin-sized cupcakes. 2nd the recipe calls for way more cream cheese than is really necessary. I think you could easily use a smaller container of cream cheese. Overall though these are great!",
