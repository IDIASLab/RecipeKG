I boil my chicken in my yummy spices & then shred it. Instead of cooking the salsa/beans in the microwave, I bring them to a boil in a pot & then throw in the chicken & let it all simmer together - more flavor gets into the chicken & blends better, I think. Like another reviewer, I did add more salsa (almost double) but thats just my taste preference...also I throw in a little cayenne for an extra kick! Very good & very easy!",

Added a table spoon of butter salt water until it covers the top of the rice closed the lid then turned it on (when the rice cooker clicks that means it's done cooking. It's so much nicer than cooking rice on the stove. You just turn it on then leave it alone.) I then cut 3 chicken breasts into chunks put 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a skillet and put the chicken in it once it's hot. While the chicken was cooking I seasoned it with salt pepper garlic powder onion powder cumin parsley and cayenne pepper. Then I stirred in a can of pinto beans (I didn't have black beans. Pinto beans work just fine.) I let the chicken and beans cook for a little longer. Then added a cup of jalape\u00f1o juice from a jalape\u00f1o jar double the salsa (I use on the border salsa) mixed in 2 American cheese slices (stir until melted) put mixture on top of rice then sprinkle grated cheese on top with cilantro (my husband likes everything cheesy). It was awesome. The jalape\u00f1o juice extra salsa and tons of cheese gave it lots if flavor. I omitted the sour cream. We aren't fans of sour cream.",
