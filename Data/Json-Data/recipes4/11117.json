Having made this recipe several times now I've made a few adjustments: 1) Grate one onion and use this in the meat. It's easier to form the meatballs 2) use 2-3 pieces of soggy bread that are either torn or sliced. One piece wasn't enough to hold together all the meat 3) add more raisins (but that's a taste preference) 4) add more Middle Eastern spices. We add a pinch of cardamom some allspice and lots of cumin. The additional spices and raisins help increase the sweet to savory ratio. Finally about those onions. Yes they do produce water and create a liquid for the meatballs to simmer in. And with the additional spices they are quite tasty. But 5 were just too much. Because we eat the meatballs as is (rather than served with pasta or rice) the onions overwhelmed the meat. I've since cut down on the number of onions used and add water instead before simmering. Overall great recipe. Thanks.",
