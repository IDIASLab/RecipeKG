I needed a recipe that would use up the fresh basil tomatoes peppers that were bordering on not being usable and this was the ticket! I used fresh chicken breast cubed and cooked in the garlic and basil. I would suggest if using chicken breast to set it aside after cooking and add it back in and the end of the cooking otherwise it can get a bit tough. I probably added a 1/3 more basil and a few more cloves of garlic. I didn't use canned tomatoes and also added in a half can of leftover tomato soup from the fridge. Added about double the amount of parmesan cheese too! (yes got a little carried away). As to 'refrigerating leftovers'..... there were none:)",
