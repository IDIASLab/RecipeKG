Texture was nice soft but firm enough to slice. I had to put foil over the top of my loaf to keep it from overbrowning during the last half of cooking. This is not a sweet bread at all. If you want a sweeter bread I suggest you apply a very generous amount of cinnamon sugar over the top of the berries before you roll up the loaf. I enjoyed this made into french toast (the syrup making up for the lack of sweetness) and toasted with honey.",

I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to do the kneading. This bread is light textured but with a great crust. I skipped the blueberries (hubby did want!). The first time around I did not have molasses so substituted 1/4 of brown sugar. Bread was good but slightly sweet. This time I bought molasses and added 1 teaspoon of salt. Perfection! The bread did not even have time to cool down before we polished off the whole loaf! Thank you for sharing!",
