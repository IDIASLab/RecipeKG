Figuring that the coating would be very delicate I floured the chicken before dipping in the egg and french fried onions. I also placed the chicken on a cooling rack, sprayed with non stick spray, above a cookie sheet so I wouldn't have to turn the chicken during baking and chancing damaging the coating. If you don't have a cooling rack try using sliced raw onion rings to place the chicken on. The results were favorable however I may add seasoning the flour next time.",

I was concerned though that the recipe might be a bit plain without any other seasoning so I cut the chicken breasts into large chunks and marinated them for about 30 minutes in a mix of Lipton savory herb & garlic soup mix and a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil. With the vegetable oil marinade I didn't use the egg as the onions stuck to the chicken just fine.",
