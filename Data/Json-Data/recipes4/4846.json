Thanks!\r\n\r\nUpdate: 8/31/13: Upgrading the rating to 5 stars...been making this for almost a year now and it's great. I tweak the ingredients depending on what I have available, but the basic recipe is solid! It tastes even better the next day!",

The sauce is very good though. I recommend my tweaks. I followed step one and then deglazed the browning pan with 1/2 cup wine (instead of 1/4 cup). Then I poured the wine glaze and vegis as directed. I will definitely make this again when I need to put something together early in the day. I served it with mashed potatoes and some stir fried vegis. Rich and satisfying meal on a very busy day. Thanks cupcake!",
