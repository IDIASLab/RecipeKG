                "reviewBody": "Wonderful! cooking pasta in a reducing broth may not be for everyone- good news is it's very versatile! & I do make it somewhat differntly - for a couple of reasons. I hate the floury taste from pasta cooked in a reducing liquid, same thing happens when you cook pasta in a crock pot-an awful floury taste.. So, if you're like me, here are some tips.. cook your pasta separately, to almost al dente.. \nthen use half the chicken broth(any kind of broth/bouillon/ soup mix will work here - if you don't care for salt tho, make sure to use low/no sodium). When you add your pasta cook it in half the broth adding more as/if needed until your pasta is completely done. Another issue for me is the oil and sausage fat (btw - you don't have to use sausage here either, ground or shredded chicken, ground turkey/beef also work well-it should be well seasoned though because it's the backbone of the dish). I use sweet Italian sausage & I add more Italian seasoning & yum-Garlic!. After cooking the onion & any other vegies (yum-diced tomatoes & mushrooms!)-then I check how much oil is in the pan -if I use sausage, I drain the oil/fat then add sausage & drain again before adding pasta. If I use chicken-then I may not drain, chicken has less fat-see how it cooks up & you can judge if you need/want to drain fat off. finally, the greens - arugula/spinach/zucchini all work great! Remember a recipe is only a guide & you know your family's tastes best.",

Like a lot of good, fast recipes it relies on sausage as \"spice shortcut\" because the spicy Italian sausage already has many spices blended in.
