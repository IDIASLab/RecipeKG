Changes I made were: 1) used lamb loin chops instead of shoulder arm because that's all I could find   2) altered spices to about 1/4 tsp each of fresh rosemary and thyme, plus 1/2 tsp each of freshly-ground coriander and cumin, a pinch or 2 of garam masala, a pinch of powdered ginger, and lots of freshly-ground black pepper  3) cut the lemon to half, because after tasting found that was plenty (and I'm a lemon fanatic)  4) used crushed tomatoes instead of diced because I have an anti-tomato-chunk person in the family  5) added about 1/4 cup red wine and 6) cooked in a slow cooker after browning lamb and cooking onion and garlic.  Don't mean to insult the creator at all, because I'm sure it's fantastic the original way, and it was fantastic with a couple alterations!  Seriously yummy!\n",

Upon initial serving I forgot to continue and add the spinach and lemon zest. I also could not find the ricotta salata cheese. My men RAVED over the flavor! My husband was bowled over by the richness of it. The comment by the author about including the bones when cooking the lamb was so correct and I'm glad I followed that suggestion! I told my husband that I'd forgotten a couple of ingredients and he commented that he didn't know that ANYTHING could imiprove the flavor. The next time I did serve it with spinach added and the lemon. The lemon was excellent as well. I can highly recommend this recipe. I had no time to play with ingredients as I always try to use a recipe as written first. I doubled it and (stretching it with extra chicken broth and tomatoes added later with the spinach) had enough to serve over brown rice for three dinners for four people.",

But we like both... and it just gets better in the fridge!  I have already committed this one to memory... my only issue is I have such a hard time cubing up the shoulder chops, but it is worth it, and definitely a labor of love for my lamb-loving boyfriend :-)  Love love love this flavorful stew!!",
