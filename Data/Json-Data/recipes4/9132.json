Although they tasted good 12 minutes was WAY too long. The cheese burned the sausage dried out and they looked ugly. Brown food is good food and they tasted good but could have been treated differently for eye appeal. Start with 6 minutes and go from there. With that being said this is a 5 star all the way. Go wild and add mushrooms if you dare. I know I will next time!",
