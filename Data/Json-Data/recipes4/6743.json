With these changes, you will have  five star recipe.  Along with the mushroom soup (I use Golden Mushroom),  you also need 1 can of water and another can of some kind of cream soup (I use cream of celery). Mix the canned soups, water and rice together, pour into the bottom of a casserole dish, add chicken breasts on top (I use bone in breasts to keep them moist long enough for the rice to cook), sprinkle with the dry onion soup mix, cover and bake at 350 for an hour to an hour and 15 minutes. The end result is a \"fix it and forget it\" meal that my whole family (along with two picky kids) really enjoys.",

I use 1 can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup 1 can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom S..oup WITH garlic 2 packages (not boxes) of Lipton Onion Soup Mix and I replace the water with Chicken broth. I cook the rice as directed on the package but instead of water I use the chicken broth both soups and 1 package of the soup mix. Once the rice is close to complete I place it in a casserole dish or baking pan and arrange the chicken on top of it. I don't like crunchy rice so this works better for me. I add the rest of the ingredients over the chicken and let it cook until the chicken AND rice are fully cooked. When I reheat the leftovers I put a little butter in it and it's wonderful!!!",
