When I saw this recipe  I was stoked after reading the reviews I changed a few things I added extra stevia 1 /4 cup and swapped the coconut oil for melted butter I cut the salt to a 1/4 teaspoon and sprinkled cinnamon on top. I needed a fix in the worse way and this did the trick! It is also a bonus that my husband hates coconut these babies are all mine!",

I used a small cookie scooper to make them uniformed in size and shape. This produced just over two dozen silver dollar sized cookies. 12 minutes left them golden brown at the edges and they held together fairly well after cooling. A bit fragile but very tasty. I'm thinking of drizzling them with candy-coat chocolate I think that would help hold them together.",
