Although I've had nothing like it before (not a huge Cuban influence where I live) and nothing to compare it to I can't imagine this \"Picadillo\" any other way. What a tasty dish! I thought the red wine would over power but it really only added to the flavours. The browned potatoes added something too. Next time I may get them a little crispier for some more texture. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of omitting the raisins. I just can't bring myself to eat them. I imagine they would've added a sweetness that we obviously didn't miss. Thanks lutzflcat for sharing a cultural dish that we would have never known about. It's a keeper!",

I do think I would do things just a tad different next time. First I won't forget to buy the green pepper! I made no sub for that. Second I would add double the cumin (personal preference). Third I used regular-sized green olives and cut them in half but next time I'd either quarter them or slice them in neat little slices (I'd like more of a bite of them more often). Fourth I'd cut the potatoes a little smaller---about 3/8\" to 1/2\" cubes and maybe even add just a little tiny bit of butter to the olive oil to make them brown a little better. I loved it when I had a raisin in my fork--just that little bit of sweetness was great! We do have a few leftovers but we are going to wrap those in flour tortillas with a little cheese and salsa this weekend! I'll let you know how that turns out! Thanks for this new taste treat!",

I'm half Puerto Rican but never cook the food I grew up eating it always seemed so time consuming to make. This is actually a pretty easy dish to make and reminds me of the filling my mother makes for empanadillas particularly the olives capers and raisins. Like another reviewer I took a shortcut i cubed the potatoes and microwaved them while browning the meat. I thought I had raisins but couldn't find them so I resorted to picking them out of a bag of trail mix! I didn't have the amount the recipe called for but that was ok because that's the one thing I don't care for in the empanadilla filling. My boyfriend was hesitant initially - he wasn't sure what to make of the picadillo but a few bites in and he was hooked. Instead of plain white rice I recommend making congri which is pretty easy and flavorful and can be made alongside this dish (especially if you use a recipe that calls for canned black beans - I used one that was not from allrecipes).",

After it simmered for a bit I ended up doubling the cumin and oregano and will probably double the potato next time as well.
