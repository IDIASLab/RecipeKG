As a rule for cooking rice, use 2:1 water to rice, and it should turn out perfect without needing to be checked or to add more water. You cut time by making things simultaneously (cooking macaroni, lentils and rice on separate burners) and the sauce in another pan. It takes about 15-20 min. cooking time and 10 min. prep. time then. Serve with kababs, chicken and mulokhia, and fattoush salad for a rounded out meal.",

However there is an Italian tradition (I'm Italian he's not) of eating lentil soup on New Year's Day to ensure prosperity in the coming year so he has to put up with them one day a year. This year I thought I'd try something a little different and found this recipe. Hubby loves tomato so I thought this might work. I cooked the lentils and the rice in a chicken veggie broth for extra flavor the pasta I used was some leftover pastina (really small pasta used for soups) and the tomato I used was leftover homemade pizza sauce. It was fantastic! My husband loved it and I could probably get him to eat it a couple of times a year because I love lentils and would like to be able to have them more often. Thanks for this one!",
