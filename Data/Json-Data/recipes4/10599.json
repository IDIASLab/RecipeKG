I've tried a few focaccia recipes on this site, and I like this one for the great directions.  Plus it doesn't use a bread machine, as so many other recipes on here do.  My only complaint is that it doesn't make enough!  :)  I will double the recipe next time, as this one was gone in no time here (and it's just me, my hubby, and my two kids- a 3 yr. old and a one yr. old!)  I almost passed this recipe up before because it looked too simple, but that was easily modified by adding a teapsoon of Italian Seasoning herb blend, and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.  I used half whole wheat for this recipe.  Served with Slow Cooker Creamy Potato Soup.  I'm glad I tried this recipe; I will be making it again!",

I also added an Italian mix of spices as the mixer kneaded. Before putting it in the oven I spread kosher salt on top of the olive oil. Interestingly my dough did not rise very much even after the first rise and I was concerned that it would be rock-like but I saw another very similar recipe which recommended the second rising be only 30 minutes so I followed those directions since my bread didn't seem to be rising anyway. I am pleased to report that in the end the bread was quite tasty. I'll be making it again.",

I used 5 Tbsp of olive oil and put it in a bowl mixed with 2 garlic cloves minced 1Tbsp of rosemary a pinch of fresh ground pepper 1/4 tsp oregano and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and a pinch of sea salt. I did this first to let the spices marrinade in the oil before getting the yeast ready. The added herbs and spices was just the way I like it. This is a great and easy recipe that is versatile. You could add any combination of herbs spices or even veggies (sundried tomatoes olives jalopeneos ect.). While the bread was cooling from the oven I brushed about 1 tsp of olive oil on the top and sprinkled shredded parmessan cheese on top. Note: I thought that the pan size was too big for the amount of dough so I baked mine in a pie plate and it worked out great. I will be making this lots with different flavor combinations.
