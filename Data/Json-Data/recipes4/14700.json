Those additions seemed to soak up the excess salt and the result was very good. When I make this again I will use a little more red wine and a couple of potatoes in the au jus.",

That being said I did use a different roasting method but liked the recipe here for the meat coating/rub and also for the au jus. As I had a 5 lb roast I was able to halve the ingredients for the coating. Even so I severely cut the amount of beef base using just enough to allow the rub ingredients to adhere to the roast. I also decreased a bit the amount of oregano called for and added instead a bit of dried rosemary. The star of this recipe in my way of thinking is the au jus. If your roast is 10 pounds as the recipe directs I suggest making a double recipe of the au jus. After reducing the sauce I strained it as directed and then pressed the vegetables against the strainer to get every last drop of goodness from them. Absolutely delicious!",
