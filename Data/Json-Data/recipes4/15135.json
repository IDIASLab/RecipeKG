I also made a few other changes - grocery store didn't have kohlrabi or parsnips so I increased the carrots and potatoes and added a cut up turnip. I also didn't add the bouillon granules but since I cooked the chicken longer I didn't need the extra chicken flavor boost. I added a bag of kluski noodles at the same time I added the cut up chicken and it turned out really well. With some good crusty bread this makes a great comfort food meal. Giving it only three stars because of the problem with the initial cooking time otherwise would be a solid a high four.",
