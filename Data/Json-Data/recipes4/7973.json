When I baked the potatoes in the oven they got so soft that once I combined everything it was like sweet potato mush (whipped potatoes).  The taste was there but not a big fan of the texture.  Wished it had more of a chunky texture.  In the future, I might cook one or two more al dente, use 2 to mix with the butter and cream cheese mixture and then roughly cut cubes of the 2 al dente potatoes and fold them in.  I think a sprinkle of cinnamon in this would have been a nice touch as well.",

The marshmallows toasted to perfection. Some of my bigger potatoes didn't soften enough in the oven beforehand, so I cut out the harder parts and tossed them ... And also cut down the cream cheese because of it. I also added a few more sprinkles of cayenne, and it got rave reviews ! Can't quite taste it at first, but gives a hint of heat when you swallow. Definitely making again, and so easy for a weeknight dinner, too !",

Sweet potato skins just don't want to stay together once you scoop them out so you wind up either with a pile of filling on a flat skin \"plate\" or you have to leave so much sweet potato in the skin that it's hardly worth it. I guess this is why you don't see twice baked sweet potatoes as much as you do regular potatoes. The filling was amazing though so I might keep this recipe and just turn it into a delicious mashed sweet potato dish instead.",
