(If you are going to change anything maybe saute the aromatics in the spices for a bit before adding the liquid.) Frying spices in a little bit of fat before adding other ingredients is a common Indian cooking technique important to releasing the full flavor of the spices (and disgusting your neighbors with that pungent Indian restaurant smell - it only smells good if you get to eat the food later!) While this is not the most authentic Indian recipe (after all it IS curried BEEF) it doesn't deserve to get bad reviews from folks who didn't follow the recipe.",

This was well received by my family. We would definitely have it again. While I tried to stay with the original ingredients and measurements the first time I would definitely add some more spice next time. I also cut my meat and apples into much smaller cubes. In my humble opinion and that of my children and husband I would add more salt more curry probably some garlic more of the tomato paste/water combination (to allow for more gravy) and I would add some medium hot sauce such as red hot (medium heat level according to the bottle). This was very good and I am so glad that Kitchen Geisha shared it with the allrecipes communities. I do not know what I would have had for dinner if not for this website and my family really liked it (which to be quite honest surprised me.)",
