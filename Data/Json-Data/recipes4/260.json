I tried again with a 10x15 jelly roll pan, and the results were fantastic.  Rolled so much easier!  I submitted the photo for this recipe, so you can see how nice it rolled up.  \n\nI'd highly recommend adding whatever typical omelette ingredients you prefer (ham, green peppers, etc).  The taste may be a little plain without any -- just like a normal omelette would.  I also used sharp cheddar to bring out the cheese taste as well.  \n\nMakes for a very nice presentation, especially compared to how simple it is to arrange.  After rolling, sprinkle a little extra cheese and parsley flakes on the top, and it will look very nice.",

Tomorrow for company I will add extra goodies like sauteed mushroom and onions or diced tomato and avocado, but today I made the recipe as written but used colby jack cheese instead of cheddar.  I lowered the oven to 425 and cooked it for 10 minutes.  It probably could have cooked for only 8 and been done.  I sprayed a glass 9x13 baking dish generously with Pam and it rolled beautifully, cut like a dream, and had an overall unique and neat presentation.  My only complaint is that my three year old who eats ANYTHING wasn't so thrilled with this.  That said, I really just want to make it for company.  It is an interesting crossover between a crepe and eggs.  For those who reduce the flour, I think it will lose some of the \"crepeness\" of it and I could see where it would just taste like eggs and cheese at that point.  It is mildly flavored so add spices and fillings to your liking.",

I cooked it for 10 minutes and took it out and put on the cheese and veggies and rolled quickly.  It's hot, but it comes up easier if it's still very warm.  I took it work for a parent appreciation breakfast and I had to give the recipe out to several ladies. **Oh, and I used a bisquit pan and poured the eggs in it when the pan was already in the oven.**  Didn't spill a drop!

I decided to still review this because I feel that this is a great method and it really has a lot of potential with a few changes. I used 9 eggs, reduced the flour to 1/4 cup, about 3/4 cup milk and the salt and pepper. After blending, I mixed in a little chives, dill and parsley. I poured it into a 10x15 sheet pan that was well sprayed with cooking spray and put it in the oven @ 350 degrees, until just set (it took about 8 mins. in mine, but my oven is very hot). I removed it, loosened the edges w/ a spatula and sprinkled it with some finely chopped onions and green peppers that I sauteed in a little olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder and then topped it w/ the cheese. I popped it back in the oven for about 2-3 minutes, just until the cheese melted, took it out and let it sit for maybe 4-5 mins. and then rolled. It rolled beautifully, cut perfectly and tasted delicious. Again, I just wanna say that this IS a great method of cooking an omelet, it just needs tweaked a little, IMO. I will definately be making this again and I can't wait to try it with different veggies and meats added! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Nevertheless, this recipe is fair and the simplicity is there. Taste is ok if you go with the original recipe but I second the motion to add whatever your fave fillings are and don't try to serve it \"rolled up.\" Just serve it from the dish you baked it in.
