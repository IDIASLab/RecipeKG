Whizzed olive oil and raw garlic with stick blender, spread on pizza crust and skipped the pre-baking garlic step\n.\n2. Sliced pears thinly and skipped pre-baking them as well.  They were nice and tender nonetheless.\n\nSubstituted feta cheese for the mozzarella, which gave a great tangy-ness against the sweetness of the pears.  My 14 y/o daughter said \"this taste's awesome!\" and hubby said, \"you could open a restaurant with this pizza\".    Will definitely make again with the above changes.\n\nThanks for the great idea, Bostoncook!",

After placing pears I drizzled honey over them then put prosciutto and mozzerella and gorgonzola crumbs for a stronger cheese flavor. Turned out amazing!",
