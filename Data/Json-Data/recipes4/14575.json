Instead of using regular bread crumbs, I use a packaged cornbread stuffing to make a more crispy/crunchy coating. The Parmesan cheese  may be increased or decreased depending on your personal taste.  Try switching out the American cheese.  I have made this with Swiss cheese and served sauteed mushrooms and onions to put over the top. I usually serve with steamed broccoli and roasted potatoes.",

My suggestion would be to add a couple of tbsp of butter to the canola when pan frying the chicken. I do this in other recipes and never have problems with the breading staying on. Also I'd bake the chicken for about 5-10 mins then add the bacon and cheese. Or just wait until it comes out of the oven and use a little cheese sauce to pour on the breasts. I had high hopes for this one but it just didn't come out quite as well as I hoped it would.",
