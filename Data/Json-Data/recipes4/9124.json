In place of the green beans  used a cup and half of sugar snap peas (personal preference) then the eggs around the bowl and finally the salmon.  I served the chopped bacon in a bowl separately on the table. (We had a Muslim and a Semi-Vegan dining with us)  I also served the dressing which I doubled in small pitchers individually at each plate. Doubling the dressing really wasn't necessary but since I was serving it individually, it looked too skimpy in the cups, sure enough two people used all their dressing!   This recipe served 4 people at a luncheon and was nary a scrap left.  We loved it.",
