I participate in a cookie exchange every year and everyone always hopes I make these again. I have actually rolled them out and used cookie cutters on them too rather than form the dough. I find that works well. Not sure what happened with the 1 star reviewer on here but I imagines they did not include the almonds or did not chop them fine. I chop my almonds in blender or food processor basically until it is like a flour. That makes up a significant part of the dough. Maybe they missed that part.",
