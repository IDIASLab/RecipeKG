It is a welcomed change from pastas with tomatoes and/or red sauce.  UPDATE 1/03/09 -- I've made this recipe SO many times now; it's a favorite with hubby and all three kids.  They actually get excited when I tell them we're having this for dinner. Here's how I've come to modify this recipe:  I use half hot Italian and half sweet Italian sausage with casings removed (about 4 links each); I fry this in a little olive oil until browned, then add sliced onion and both red and green peppers for color; I continue cooking until sausage is done and veggies are tender; then I add one full can of College Inn beef broth plus 1-2 T beef base, plus 2/3 lb. cooked pasta (we like Cavatelli and bow ties), and also add a sprinkling of crushed red pepper flakes, about 1 tsp. black pepper and salt to taste.   TIP:  For lots of flavor, DON'T drain the sausage.  Sure, it's not good for your hips or heart, but boy does it kick this up!  After making this dozens of times, I really think this is key to great flavor. Afterall, if you're serving sausage for dinner, you're really not expecting a healthy meal, right? LOL",

My husband is not too fond of tomatoes or tomato sauces so this was an ideal alternative. It was quick and delicious. I modified the recipe by using only a half a pound of sweet italian sausage freeing the meat from its casing and cooking it loose. I also added a half a pound of sliced mushrooms to the bellpeppers which really added a mellow taste and added flavor to the beefiness of the broth. I added a little bit more beef broth than the recipe called for and really let it soak into the pasta. At the end I added a small dollop of butter to smooth out the sauce although this of course adds a little fat to an otherwise fairly lean recipe. Just a light dusting of Hungarian paprika and Lawry's seasoning salt also added a bit of flavor but I would venture this would be unnecessary if the beef broth used was salty to begin with. I think this recipe could even be a great noodle dish using just vegetables broth and farfalle. The sauce was great!",

I don t know if that s what was responsible or not or if I just plain love pasta sausage and peppers but this was excellent. Used rigatoni rather than farfalle and unlike other reviewers did NOT use the grease rendered by the sausage. Rather I removed the cooked sausage from the pan cleaned it out then cooked green and red peppers onions garlic and mushrooms in olive oil before returning the cooked sausage to the pan adding the beef broth then reducing somewhat. Tossed it all together with a good dab of butter. A sprinkling of freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano was the finishing touch.",

I boiled a 12 oz. box of bowtie pasta and used 1 can of Campbell's Beef Broth in the sausage mixture. I omitted salt because the beef broth had enough salt in it. I didn't have peppers so I used 1 cup of canned peas. I will make this again and prepare it as written and I also want to try this with a jar of roasted red peppers or a bag of frozen stirfry peppers and onions (cook them separate from the sausage to carmelize then add to the sausage.) This recipe has many possibitlites. Because I used 12 oz. of pasta it was necessary to use the entire can of beef broth and each bowtie was covered with the sauce and it was not runny. I served this with fresh grated parm cheese on top french bread and a salad.",

I use 2 lbs of Italian sausage (I prefer the type that is ground and found in a roll I think it's Bob Evans brand fresh peppers and instead of the beef broth I make up a package of Au Juice for the gravy. (Sometimes Au Juice can be found in can with the soups but I cannot find it anymore...it was so much better than the envelope mix that I have to purchase now). This substitution of Au Juice makes a world of difference in the overall flavor of this dish! With just four ingredients (pasta sausage peppers au juice) this dish is delicious! If you want to get \"fancy\" throw in some mushrooms or onions or whatever to make it your own....but it's GREAT with just those four ingredients. My family requests this frequently and I feed a hungry crowd of teenaged boys. One of those quick easy and go-to meals. Serve with crusty bread and salad. Thanks to KSUDA for the recipe!",
