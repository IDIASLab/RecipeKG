Made it a second time using 1 tsp of honey rather than 2 tbsp and it was much better.  Also used romano cheese rather than parmesean, and only used 1/2 tsp onion powder.  Instead of adding dried herbs, we mixed the other ingredients together in a sauce pan and submerged a sprig each of fresh basil and oregano in the tomato mixture.  Simmered for just a few minutes and then discarded the herb sprigs.  We ended up with smooth tomato texture with a nice fresh herb taste.  Don't simmer too long or the herb taste will be too overpowering! This sauce also has a kick when you cut back on the honey.  Next time we'll do 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper *or* cayenne, not both.  But we'll definitely make it again!",

Anchovies give this a salty balance against the honey sweetness. The odd thing was this was voted a top review, people please! I could eat this with a spoon as is, it's just that good. In my 50 years of life this is the best pizza sauce i've ever tasted. (yep, it's THAT good)",

The recipe really does need them - don't worry about it being fishy, it's not, and it adds the savory character necessary to balance the honey.
