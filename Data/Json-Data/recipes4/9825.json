Carrots take much longer to cook than zucchini so start the diced carrots first... then add the onion and celery and finally when they are almost tender add the zucchini. (or perhaps consider grating the carrot which would then could very quickly) When you get to the puree step make sure to also puree the cream of? soup. In my case I had a delicious soup but with some random lumps from the cream of celery soup. Should have pureed that too. The flavor of this soup was wonderful very rich and absolutely delicious. What a fantabulous way to get your daily dose of veggies! Yum!",

I pureed with vegetable stock we already made then put everything back in the soup pot included saved onions and mushrooms. I added cream instead of milk about 1 cup some salt and pepper.

For anyone cooking for someone with hyperreactive innards or not liking seasoned food this recipe is fine as written. For those who prefer seasoned food you ll need to add the ones you prefer or you ll likely end up finding this soup lacking flavor as some other reviewers noted... make that one simple fix and turn this into a great soup. To save prep time just rough chop the vegetables rather than dicing them if you re going to puree the soup per the directions. The approx. 20 minute cook time at medium low is spot on. Pulsed the soup in a Vitamix blender leaving flecks of zucchini and carrot for visual appearance. We subbed condensed golden mushroom soup for cream of mushroom 1-1/4 cups chicken stock (omitted water & chicken bouillon) and used light sour cream. We went with the optional white wine using a sauvignon blanc. Seasoned with sazon white pepper and dash of cayenne pepper. This made a distinctly flavored creamy soup and they already want more made soon. Thank you Karen.",
