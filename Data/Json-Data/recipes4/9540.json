The dough was runny, and the spaetzle came out pretty mushy even after frying. I added almost 2 cups of flour and made a second batch, and WOW what a differance. Spaetzle should be nice and firm, not mushy.  The second batch was delish. But instead of nutmeg i used garlic and onion powder to go along with my creamed chicken. Also i boiled it in alted water. Salting the water makes a HUGE differance.",

We also make Kase Spaezle with this by sauteeing onions and garlic in butter and adding some bacon or pancetta, add the dumplings and then at the end add a cup or two of swiss cheese, (let it melt) and a dash of parsley.

It was delicious. Frying the spaetzle with butter is a must. Don't be afraid to use the nutmeg; it gives it a great flavor as it tends to be on the bland side. If you are going to the trouble making the dumplings at least double the recipe (no need to double the butter though). It is great reheated. I quadrupled it so I'd have enough to serve with my saurbraten in a few days.",
