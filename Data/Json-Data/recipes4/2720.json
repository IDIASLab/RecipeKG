It was EASY and very tasty! Even the cabbage tasted delicious to me. I didn't add anything extra and actually drank the shot of whiskey instead of adding it! My corned beef could have been more tender but that's what happens when you can't let it cook as long as it's supposed to because it smells too good and you are starving! I froze the leftovers in individual portions to enjoy on another day. Thanks for sharing!",
