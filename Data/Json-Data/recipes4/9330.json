Over the years my brothers and I moved in three separate directions all far from NYC. I happened upon this recipe a few years ago and tried it out. OMIGOSH It was like stepping back in time! I've made the tarradls for my brothers and shipped them to Florida and North Carolina a couple of times a year. They rave about them and actually hoard them! Vince this recipe has given me so much pleasure in being able to revisit the past and especially treat my good bros once in awhile. Thanks so much. LOVE THIS RECIPE!",
