The rest came out fine. \nInfobit number two: I think the amount of chicken could have been scaled back a bit. Maybe a pound and a half would be sufficient for three or four people. \nOverall, I was pleased. I wish I would\u2019ve had some sweet and sour sauce but I had to settle for soy and teriyaki baste.",
