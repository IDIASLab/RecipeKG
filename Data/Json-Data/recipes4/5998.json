I cooked them about 1 1/2 minute per side on medium high. I served it with roasted vegetables (asparagus, fresh green beans, red bell pepper & grape tomatoes coated with a little olive oil & sprinkled with salt & pepper roasted in oven at 400 degrees on parchment paper for about 12-14 minutes)on top of leafy greens. I drizzled a little lime basil vinaigrette (Maple Grove of Vermont Fat-Free brand)over it all & sprinkled a little feta cheese over the top. Absolutely perfect for a summer meal, especially after a good workout!",
