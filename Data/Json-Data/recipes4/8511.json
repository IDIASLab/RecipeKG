I am always looking for new multi-purpose chili sauces so I thought I would give this a try. Being I already had roasted and peeled green chili in the freezer I skipped the first 4 steps of this recipe other than seeding and chopping. I cooked the recipe as written. It was easy to put together and had a lot of flavor. I definitely will make this again. Thanks for sharing.",

I followed the recipe but blended a little of it with my immersion blender for a better consistency.  It was as close to the real deal as I am going to get without traveling to New Mexico.
