The only difference is that after I put the ingredients together in the baking pan, I COVER the pan with foil.  I didn't notice whether or not the posted recipe uses cooked or uncooked ravioli.  I use UNCOOKED ravioli.  The layers pretty much work the same way.....I like to add a little fresh mozzarella in between the layers so it has that gooey-ness of lasagna.  After I cover it, I bake it ABOUT 45 minutes to one hour at 350.",

I was able to put this together fairly quickly (and fairly cheaply as well because all of the ingredients were bought at Aldi!) at the start of my day and it was ready to go at dinnertime. I did take another reviewer's suggestion and add cheese in the layers as well as on top. I did sprinkle a good amount canned parmesan along with the shredded mozzerellla, too. The whole family enjoyed it, especially my two kids. We sopped up the additional sauce with white trash garlic bread (softened butter and lots of garlic powder, spread onto sandwich bread and thrown under the broiler). NO LEFTOVERS. Definitely a make again.",

I'll admit that I'm not a huge slow cooker fan, but this one won me over, and I definitely would make it again.  It really is a \"no brainer,\" tastes pretty darn good, quick to get into the crock pot, and using a crock pot liner makes cleanup a breeze.  I think one or two links of Italian sausage cooked with the ground beef would be a good addition. The presentation may not be classic lasagna, but you definitely will think you're eating lasagna...those cheese raviolis really do the job!  RandyOSU you won me over!",

I like to give a recipe a fair shot by not doing any changes the first time I make.  Next time I will cook for three hours and that will be plenty.
