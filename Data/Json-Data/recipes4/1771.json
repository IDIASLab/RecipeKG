I did follow a few of the suggestions: used Gorgonzola instead of bleu cheese & drizzled honey on the top after a few minutes of cooling.  \n\nI also added about 2 tablespoons of light cream cheese to balance the Gorgonzola and to make the tart a little creamy.  Also, I forgot to add the light cream at first, so I \"poured\" a drop onto each tart individually after I filled them.  This turned out fine.  There was quite a bit of mix left after filling the 15 tartletts, so I created my own tartlets by using regular philo dough (sp?) and cutting it into small squares (about 5 or 6 layers). If you make your own, make sure you brush melted butter on the dough so it will turn golden.  (I forgot that step.)\n\nNext time, I will dice the pear pieces up smaller & add a piece of walnut to the finished product before drizzling the honey.  \n\nThe description said it was time-consuming, but I found this to be one of the easiest things I've made in a while.  The \"work\" is in dicing the pear & filling the tarts - not time-consuming at all.",

After reading all the reviews I did tweak the recipe slightly based on personal taste but I think it would have probably been good without changes too just stronger. I like blue cheese but suspected out guests may not be as fond so I wanted to tame it a bit. These changes will make about 30 appetizer tarts as it basically doubles the volume of the recipe. 1. used about 2 -3 ounces of Pear Blue Cheese - that's what I had on hand. 2.added half a brick of cream cheese ( 4 oz) to mellow out and make it melt more and help meld with pears 3. used 2 pears to increase creaminess and pear-iness and diced them in 1/4\" dice 4. did not add cream 5. added a carmelized walnut to the top of each tart before popping in the oven (1 cup walnuts to 1/2 cup sugar set to medium in a pan and stir constantly until sugar melts and carmelizes walnuts. turn onto non stick foil until cool) I used regular tart shells - that what I had on hand. (I have never seen pre made phyllo tart shells in my stores). I must confess that I think I ate more of these than our company. I am going to make them again later this week. They were delicious.",
