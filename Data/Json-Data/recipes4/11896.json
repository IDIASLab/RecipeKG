        "description": "My husband is Chinese and I am Western. Between the two of us we came up with this recipe for fried rice that is actually a meal in a bowl. Now all my Chinese relatives make it this way and our Western friends have asked us to teach them how it is made. Optional ingredients include meat, salted fermented black beans, cashews, and chili oil. I can do this dish in well under half an hour, and that includes all the chopping. This dish is good for colds, depression, writer's block, stubbed toes, insomnia, heartbreak, religious crises and general crankiness. It can change your life. Yum.",

I added chicken to the recipe and plan to make it again with shrimp. The quantities that I had to buy the Asian ingredients in will make the recipe at least two maybe three more times. All in all it is a very economical meal. The amount of garlic looked like too much to me so I just did 2 1/2 tbsp. but I'm sure it would have been fine with 4. The fresh ginger tastes so good in this recipe. Leftovers are just as good as fresh! I want to use this for company sometime and have all the chopping done early and throw it together when they arrive. This is a definite keeper.",

This was my first successful foray into Chinese cooking at home and mostly thanks to all of the in depth technique notes (keeping the wok very very hot etc.) it came out beautifully. I made a few substitutions: I swapped the dried bean curd out for hickory smoked tofu marinated in tamari brown sugar black pepper and cayenne pepper. I also added in the highly recommended preserved black beans and they were amazing as promised. Also I did not have enough fresh ginger or garlic on hand but the recipe came out okay with 3T of garlic and 2T of ginger. All in all a great recipe my boyfriend and I loved it and there are PLENTY of leftovers! I think that next time I make it I'll want a little drizzle of sweet sauce (like a plum wine reduction or something) to set off the savory lightly caramelized flavors.",
