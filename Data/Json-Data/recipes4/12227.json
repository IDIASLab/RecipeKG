I would use 1 less bouillon cube, and i would also cook it for 30 minutes instead of 35.\n\nThanks for sharing.",

We did not add any salt or flavourings.The flavours were crisp and fresh. I made it in a pressure cooker in 10 minutes. There was too much liquid so I reserved it for another soup. Quite delicious. I served this pureed and added fresh grated zucchini on top and the whole family loved it. Thank you C. Berry for your recipe.",

Another thing... there was way too much onion in it - good for flavor but they start to burn your tastebuds after eating so many. Maybe a half an onion for each batch would do better. I would give 3 1/2 since it really wasn't that bad but that's not an option.",
