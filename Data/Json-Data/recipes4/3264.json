I did however, double the spices and because I had a bag of Granny Smith apples, I peeled two apples and sliced them really thin and put them in the pan with the onions.  The only beer I had available was Corona Light so I used that.  The out come was beyond my exceptations.  It was really, really good.  The apples added a tartness, but didn't overwhelm the taste of the pork roast.  I've tried the Autumn Pork roast from this site(that recipe is awesome as well) but this recipe had a completly different taste.  Both are wonderful and I'll be making both recipes often.  Because of this site my cooking abilities have really improved.  I'm not always serving the same dishes over and over......I'm a huge All Recipe.com fan.  And often refer the site to friends and family.  Keep the good stuff coming....",

I will say I doubled the amount of rub I used but this could be a personal preference thing (but other might want to try it). I'm also curious about trying apple cider instead of beer. Might be good and make for an interesting gravy. One thing... it took forever to bake and I had to add a little more beer... but I think I my have done something wrong.

I had never made one before and I found this recipe! This recipe was GREAT! My fiance LOVED it. Alongside the roast I made mashed potatoes pork gravy (just the package kind) and creamed sweet corn! The combination of the 3 was tasty! Where I live good meats are hard to come by so I only had about a 2.5 lb roast...which was great for just 2 people. Even though the roast was smaller I still used to same amount of all other ingredients! I added garlic cloves to the roasting pan with the onions and I added garlic powder and onion powder to the rub! Miller Lite beer is the only way to go in my family so naturally I used that. The great part.. I have leftovers for dinner tonight! BBQ Pork sandwiches it is!",

I used the exact amount of seasonings, only reducing the salt to 1 tsp. & I added 1/3 cup of some homemade apple butter to the beer before placing in a crock pot.  I cooked on high starting around 11 am and it was falling apart within 4 hours in the crock pot.  I served with maggi (authentic German dumplings) spaetzle, Gundelsheim (Original German Recipe) Barrel Red Cabbage, homemade mashed potatoes and Trappey's jalapeno Black Eye peas with some additional seasonings for New Year's day.  My husband made the Beer Bread 1 to go with this.  Will update you on the finished product. \nUpdate:  Heavenly.",
