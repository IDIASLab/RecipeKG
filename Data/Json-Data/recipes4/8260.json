From there portioned onto plates and placed a sliced grilled Chicken breast on top. Sprinkled with a little more cheese and homemade croutons. Definitely a very simple recipe.. But sometimes you need that inspiration for dinner or lunch! My only suggestion is to use your favourite Caesar dressing whether it be homemade or a not.. As that really will make or break the dish.",
