I then made 5 generous patties & skipped the frying. I put canola on the silpat, coated 1 side of the patties, then turned them over so oil was on the top & bottom. Baked at 375* in the toaster oven on convection for 30 minutes. The bottoms were browned as if \"fried\", and the tops were \"toasted\" nicely. They are filling - I could only eat 1.5 with rice salad on the side. I was craving Dijon mustard, so used that instead of a cheese sauce (which I'll try on the leftovers). These are easy to make & good for stretching the budget. I will make them again - I bet this would make good tuna patties, too.  Thanks, Tracy Ann!",

Taste was quite delish.\" I halved the recipe for one can of salmon and followed everything else in the recipe other than forming the patties in the morning and wrapped each tightly in Saran in the fridge so they'd keep their shape better. My only minor complaint was that a total of 12-16 min. in the skillet followed by 20 min. in the oven resulted in a rather dry patty that we had to liberally lube up in various squirts of condiments and drag them thru our favorite salmon patty side dish of nuclear orange mac n' cheese. They were still tasty and the \"Largeness\" at least for the five that I made was more of a chubbiness rather than circumference as I wanted to be able to fit all five in the skillet together.",
