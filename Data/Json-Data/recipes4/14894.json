I do add my sausage with my red beans but I slice my sausage and then saut\u00e9 with my onions and bell peppers before adding the rest of the ingredients. I think this helps to keep texture of the sausage. After cooking for 30 minutes I take the lid off and adjust my settings to Browning which will bring the liquid to a boil. As it is boiling I mash some beans let it boil for about 10 minutes and it will get nice and creamy.  Serve over white rice. Yum!!",

I rinsed them and added 4 cups of water. I knew that 5 cups was way too much. I added a smoked turkey hock for flavor along with garlic, a couple of Bay leaves, and a couple tbsp of creole/Cajun seasoning.  I didn't add my sausage until the 30 mins were up. As the beans were cooking I saut\u00e9ed the trinity (green bell peppers, celery, and onions) with the smoked sausage. When the pressure was released I added the trinity and the sausage and mashed some of the beans to make them creamy, and cooked them for another 15 minutes. OMG!!! My family and I are from Louisiana and we know good red beans and rice.  The best that I've ever made. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

The flavors are not quite same without this step. Also, we always used either homemade chicken stock (if there's anything left from Sunday dinner) or chicken broth (low sodium since the sausage is salty) rather than water. This actually makes the beans creamier. Yes, you do have to smash some of the beans and let them make \"gravy\". This is a dish we have all four seasons! YUM.",

Next time I will soak the beans overnight then cook for 20 minutes without the sausage mash the beans add the sausage and cook another 20 minutes (as mentioned by another reviewer.) Time consuming but easy and it should produce a more desired result. Be careful about the amount of water (don't add too little) since the beans will absorb water. After mashing adjust as necessary. Also - I only used 1 1/2 T. of cajun seasoning and it was on the verge of too much for us. 2 T. would have been way to much. I'm not Cajun so that's part of the reason.

Seasoning mix was very good -- fairly close to what I currently use when cooking regular stovetop beans -- I don't currently use cumin in mine but I liked the taste with the added cumin. I wondered if the beans would have the creamy textured liquid that I wanted -- they didn't. In the end I just mashed some beans in the pot and cooked a while longer to thicken. Next time I'll do as another reviewer recommended and cook 30 minutes -- stop cooking and use my prior method to saut\u00e9 the veggies and mash some beans. Then pressure cook another 20 minutes. I will still soak overnight to clean the beans and completely hydrate the beans.",
