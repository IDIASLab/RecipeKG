I doubled the cheese to 4 cups of mozzarella and used 4 fresh tomatoes from my garden rather than canned.    I also used half olive oil and half water with a handful of torn basil to be more like bruschetta.  I then added a TBS of balsamic vinegar reduction. (You could use plain balsamic vinegar)  I used 4 garlic cloves and cut the chicken into wide strips rather than chunks.  I added  some dried parsley and oregano on top of the cheese and I then topped the entire dish with freshly grated parmesan cheese. This recipe turned out soooo good there was not even a crumb of it left!",

Instead of bread stuffing mix I used my own cubed whole wheat bread and mixed this with 2 cans of italian seasoned diced tomatoes and romano cheese. I seasoned the chicken with Italian seasoning then cut into cubes and lightly breaded with whole wheat bread crumbs and grated romano cheese. I added the chicken to the bottom of a slow cooker and topped with the tomato mixture.  Cooked on low for 8 hours then topped with romano cheese before serving. Froze leftovers",
