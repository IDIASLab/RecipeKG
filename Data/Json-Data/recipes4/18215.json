I didn't puree the beans at all but I added them to the soup without draining them for creaminess. I also used diced Italian tomatoes with basil garlic and oregano. To keep the soup thinner I also added an extra cup of water (5 total not 4) which kept it a better consistency after the noodles absorbed some liquid. This is delicious and everyone loved it!",
