I usually use sage sausage and add some hot pepper flakes or vice versa. My neice has been helpping me make these at Thanksgiving since she was 3 - I make the filling before she gets here and she wears my apron and fills all the mushrooms. Great tradition and so easy to pull off. Thanks for posting this one!!",

Brown sausage, break into smallish pieces, drain and add cream cheese. Mix together and fill mushrooms. Sprinkle with paprika and bake at 375 for 30 minutes. The sausage provides enough flavor that you don't need to add anything else. The longer cooking time cooks the mushrooms all the way through and browns the tops so you don't need bread crumbs. Try it and see the difference for yourself!",
