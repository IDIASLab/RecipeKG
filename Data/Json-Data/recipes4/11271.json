I also added some garlic salt and went a little heavier on the crushed garlic and black pepper to the mix and cut the meat down to 2-3 lb pieces, fat side removed, and let marinade overnight. I cooked this over a charcoal grill until between medium rare to medium and sliced up into approximately 4 inch strips. This was a major hit at the picnic. A side note the remaining marinande was applied to the meat throughout the cooking process for additional seasoning.",
