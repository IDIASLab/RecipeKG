Used a can of diced tomatoes 1 can kidney beans drained 1 can black bean undrained browned up some ground beef ( about 1/2lb) with an onion. For seasonings: 1T chile powder 1t each: oragano& cumin 1/2t garlic powder 1/4t chile pepper & a pinch of red pepper flakes. Instead of crushed tortillas I cut some flour tortillas into strips and put them on top of the sour cream lattice style topped with cheese. Great base recipe thanks for sparking an idea for a great supper. The whole family loved it.",

It was a little soupy so I would recommend adding 1/4 cup water instead of 3/4 cup as instructed. I used brown instead of white rice and plain greek yogurt for the sour cream. No one ever notices it's a great healthy substitution. I think adding corn or black beans would enhance the flavor as well and I'm always looking for ways to add veggies. I did add a bag of frozen peppers and onions. They were sliced but diced would have fit in better.",
