To make it 5 stars,  I made the following changes, which really bumped up the flavor and we enjoy it much more--  when the italian sausage is just browned, add in 1 diced onion, and about a minute later, 3 cloves of minced garlic.  Cook until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant.  Then add in the stock and spices and potatoes.  Once the potatoes are done, stir in the cream and any additional milk (if desired) and season with salt and pepper.  I used 1 cup of heavy cream rather than 2 cups of half-and-half, and omitted most of the milk, using 4 cups of chicken stock.  These minor changes make it much more flavorful and reminiscent of our favorite Italian restaurant's version!",

As far as the directions go, my potatoes were done in 15 minutes, and I did not add any milk or half and half until the end of the cooking, when I allowed them to heat through, but not boil.  This has an amazing aroma as it cooks, and it is a hearty, satisfying soup.  Do not be concerned by the lack of added salt, because the broth and sausage are salty enough to flavor the whole batch.

Radishes!!!  I know, I was weirded out too. But the bite cooks out of them and they have a very similar consistency of potato. We just scrubbed them and left the skins on. The soup doesn't turn out quite a thick, but the taste is satisfying and wonderful without all of the carbs! Per 100 grams, radishes have 3.4 carbs compared to 17 carbs in the potato. Try it!!",

Like the other reviewer, I wouldn't add the milk/half & half til after the potatoes and kale have cooked.  It would curdle and I'm always a clutz on the stove top with boiling (I have a 2 yo, that helps distract me :)  Love that I'm getting all the vitamins and yumminess in one bowl!  Hubby could have done without the kale, but he also would eat bacon by the pound if he could!",

After about 15 minutes, I added the sausage and tons of kale to the pot. I seasoned with salt, pepper, oregano, and a little garlic powder (what can I say? I really like garlic!). I also added about 2 cups of whole milk and let the whole pot simmer until the kale was tender.  Awesome!  I will be making this again!",

Once potatoes were tender I added double the amount of kale as well. Seasoned with oregano parsley basil pepper alittle salt and red pepper flakes let cook for another 10 minutes then added 2 cups of whole milk and 2 cups of heavy cream. Let cook another 5 minutes and served it up. My fiance and I loved it. My best friend went for seconds I can't wait to get home from work today to have more!",
