                "reviewBody": "I admit I was more interested in the concept of cooking a turkey breast in the slow cooker rather than the recipe itself, so I cooked mine with some minor changes. The amount of Worcestershire seemed excessive so I just used a few shakes. Didn't use flour, the sage, or the can of turkey gravy. I seasoned the breast with garlic pepper and a little poultry seasoning and laid a couple of bacon strips over the breast to help keep it moist and to flavor the gravy (I've always done this with my tradionally roasted turkey). Knowing that a lot of juices would be produced, I just threw in a portion of the bag of turkey gravy that came in the package. I found the stated cooking time WAY too long--I would think 6 hours on Low should me more than adequate, and next time I would check it even sooner. The turkey at 6-1/2 hours was cooked to a higher temperature than I would have preferred, but was still surprisingly moist. After I pulled the breast out to rest, I thickened up the gravy with a little cornstarch on the stovetop.  The turkey was succulent and moist and sliced beautifully, and the gravy was rich and flavorful. This method will definitely be making a comeback.",

This recipe is fantastic! We won't be eating the turkey until much later this afternoon, but I have to admit that I did sneak a few tastes as I sliced it up. Here's how I prepared mine. I put the two roasts in a large crockpot, opened up both gravy packets and dumped that over the roasts, then added one chopped vidalia onion and one bunch of chopped celery hearts...leaves and all...and a bay leaf. Then I sprinkled the tops of the roasts with crushed dried sage, thyme, salt, and cracked black pepper. I set this to cook on low...thought the roasts might take all night and most of today because they were almost completely frozen...I started this at 9:30 last night and by 7:30 this morning they were tender, very moist, and exceptionally savory. I did get up to baste the tops once during the night, but I don't think it was really necessary. This is the only way that I will ever prepare turkey from now on. This is a must-try recipe; it is OUTSTANDING!! Thank you so much for sharing this...can't wait for dinner later today.",

I did not have a can of turkey gravy so I just put in the gravy packet that came with the turkey breast. I left the skin on and I cooked longer than the recipe called for about 11 hours just because of timing for my Christmas Eve meal but it would probably be fine timed as directed. I tied the breast with string as other reviewers have suggested and it looked beautiful coming out nicely browned. When near serving time I removed the breast from the crockpot and added about 2 cups of chicken broth to the drippings for gravy. I stirred a couple of tablespoons of flour into some broth and added that to the mix and turned the crockpot to high to thicken. The result was an out-of-this-world gravy to go with the turkey. I am so pleased with this recipe. Can't wait for turkey sandwiches tomorrow! This is definitely a keeper I'll be making it throughout the year.",
