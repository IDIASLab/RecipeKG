I used cod (about a 1/3 of the price) and the flavor was still great.  I also used a couple extra pototoes and pureed them after they got a bit soft to help create a thicker consistency.  I replaced the tomatoes with a can of corn, used 1 cup of skim milk, and about 1/2 of a 14 oz can of reduced fat evaporated milk.  In addition to the fish, I added a can of minced clams, reserving the clam juice.  I mixed the clam juice with about 3-4 Tbsp of cornstarch and that really thickened the chowder nicely.  I shook in a good amount of salt and pepper and also added a little Old Bay and cayenne.  With the richness of this chowder the way I prepared it, it's hard to believe there is only about 3-4 grams of fat per serving.",

I added it to the completed soup at the end. I also used up the leftover potatoes from the night before. I added the potatoes with the garlic but only cooked it for two minutes instead of ten. I didn t shred the carrots. I threw some baby carrots in a food processor and pulsed them until they were chopped up. I think this is a pretty healthy chowder. Most of the base is chicken broth and there is only cup cream and one tablespoon butter. Not bad and it tastes wonderful.",
