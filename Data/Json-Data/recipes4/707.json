Keeping just enough water in the bottom throughout the baking process makes a really flavorvul juice that would go well with throwing some potatos in for the last 30 mins. However the combination of flavors are simple and wonderful and I am quite happy I found this recipe. Thanks V Greer:)",

Laid it on a piece of foil (without browning it first) and poured the mustard mix over it.  Wrapped the foil tightly around it and place it flat in the slow cooker, on high for 2 hours, then another 7 hours at low.  Actually did this overnight.  It coated beautifully and was SO tender.  Used only about a teaspoon of black pepper.  The only change I will make next time is to directly salt and pepper the pork all over before laying it on the foil.  Easy!",

I added some potatoes to the pan for the last hour and they were wonderful, but I was really looking for a sauce to put over the pork roast when we ate it.  These flavors were soooooo good, I wanted more!  Thanks for a great recipe!  Even our Miss Picky 2 year old ate it!  UPDATE - 10/18/06  Made it again with a little water in the bottom (about 1/3 c) and put a can of whole potatoes in the same pan to roast.  The water helped to make a little sauce that was DIVINE on the potoates and the meat. Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, goooooooood!",

I also put slivers of garlic into the slits before I brushed on the sauce. I cooked it for 20 min. at 400 degrees added water to cover the bottom of pan as others suggested (it keeps the roast moist) lowered temp to 350 and cooked it approx. another 60 min. basting frequently and adding water as needed. I saw no need to turn the roast over. There was a nice amount of pan gravy to use over mashed potatoes. We really enjoyed the flavor! Thanks submitter!!!",

I used this recipe in the crockpot and doubled the amount of sauce (except for the pepper only used 2 teaspoons). Placed it in the crockpot added a 1/2 cup of water to the bottom and cooked on low for 8 hours. Pork wasn't as tender as I'd hoped but I think that was my mistake - the cut of roast was too thick to tenderize in 8 hours. The sauce tasted pretty good especially after I boiled the drippings and added some cornstarch for a gravy. Yum. I had added potatoes under the pork with a layer of onions on top hoping they'd soak the flavor of the honey mustard and unfortunately for me they did. Folks honey mustard and potatoes do NOT mix so don't do what I did. Ended up tossing out the potatoes and saving the roast. Stick to the recipe and double the sauce and it'll turn out great.",
