I used the food processor for the zucchini onion and to crush the crackers. One tip they are rather difficult to flip if you make them large. Rather than 8 large pancakes I did 16 smaller ones and they were much easier to turn. Also I would wait to add the egg and salt until just before you cook them. As the batter sits it gets a little runny. Mixing it up just before cooking solved that. Thanks for a nice way to use up a ton of zucchini.",
