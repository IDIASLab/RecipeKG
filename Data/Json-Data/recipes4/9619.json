The recipe was good however based on prior reviews I added some Italian seasoning and used only 3tbsp oil total. I also added some fresh lemon juice to the fish before cooking it. This made the recipe a lot less bland than it would have been. The meal was nice and light too but still left you satisfied. I will be making this again in the future!",
