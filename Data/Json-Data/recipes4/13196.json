I couldn't understand why you would use undiluted pinapple juice concentrate and then add a whole cup of water so I just left out the water and used regular pineapple juice from a can with pinapple chucks.  I used low sodium soy sauce, 2 tsp. of minced garlic, 1 tsp. of ginger and 2 tsp. of Frank's red hot. I also added 2 Tbsp. of veg. oil. I cut up boneless chicken breasts into thick chunks for kabobs and let it marinate for over 24 hours.  I grilled them with red and green peppers, onions, and cherry tomatoes.  The chicken was moist and quite good, but the marinade needs something - brown sugar for a little more sweetness or red pepper flakes for a little more kick....",
