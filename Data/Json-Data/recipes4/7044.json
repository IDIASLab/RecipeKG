What a perfect after snow or freezing day movie night dinner. Sure beats the sound of pizza. Thanks. I'm saving this.",

I used a bread dough that I've used plenty of times but I think it just turned out too carb-heavy with the mashed potatoes and the stuffing in the dough. Might be better if stuffing was eliminated and craisins were incorporated- give it a little more punch. I tried to save some by dunking them in velvetta but to no avail.",
