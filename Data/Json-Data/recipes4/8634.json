I had to use jalapeno peppers because I could not find Hungarian peppers - I called around to five major supermarkets in New York and New Jersey and they don't carry them.  Hungarian peppers are the mildest form of peppers in the \"hot pepper\" family.  Hence, if you used them you could probably eat a lot more - by using the jalapenos - this is a very spicy appetizer and not one I would use to serve before a dinner party (I want my guests to be able to taste my food!)  The internet suggests using Anaheim peppers for a substitution, but again, they don't sell them in my area.  The filling is delicious - if you are using jalapenos - I would suggest using sweet sausage rather than hot to cut down on the heat.  If you like HOT go for the jalapenos and hot sausage.  Thank you submitter - this is a great appetizer for sport events and drinking beer!!!!!\r\n",
