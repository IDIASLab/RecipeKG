One caveat: if you read the recipe and follow the part about 30 mins at 350 degrees....trichinosis is likely to ensue and the potatoes will be as hard as quantum mechanics.

I have made this on my own without a recipe. I thought I'd just check to see if maybe there were some other ideas. I always brown my ribs in a frying pan 1st. Don't need to add oil. The ribs have MORE than enough grease to cook with. That grease gets tossed out. I season with salt (not much as the sauerkraut has plenty) pepper granulated garlic and Johnnys Seasoning. I then place the ribs in my crock pot with the sauerkraut. Put the lid on place the crock pot on high and go about my way. About an hour before we eat I make mashed potatoes. MY personal little trick with my mashed potatoes is instead of using milk with a little bit of butter with pepper is to use a little bit of canned milk. To my family and myself it makes the mashed potatoes not quite so thin. Then we can make a little well in the center of the potatoes and put sauerkraut and juice over the top. This is my little kingdom of heaven. Thank you for putting this recipe up!!! It's wonderful.",
