Browning the sausage took longer than it did to put this together and bake it. A great fast meal for when you want something home cooked on a busy evening. Serve with a salad and hot veggies or fruit and your meal is done. The ingredients are so flexible with this recipe. Different flavors of sausage and different cheeses will change this meal up. Great recipe Veronica thanks for sharing.",
