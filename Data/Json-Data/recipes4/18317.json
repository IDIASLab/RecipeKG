Mine turned out more of a soup which is what I like but if you want a thicker chili you might want to  drain some of the liquid from the tomatoes or either add less water. On that note, I think the one thing that would give this chili an extra boost of flavor is to use chicken broth in place of the water. I used fire roasted tomatoes but any of the seasoned blends (or plain) would work in this. Overall this is a great recipe and one I would make again. Thanks for sharing!",

This made all the spices stick to the chicken which made the chicken absolutely yummy, yet spices still flavored the creamy sauce. I really loved the result. My hubby thought it had too many beans. The next day I sauteed one chopped onion and three thinly sliced celery stalks until onion was translucent. Added four peeled and chopped carrots and one 12 ounce can chicken broth and brought mixture to a boil. Reduced heat. Simmered 20 minutes. Added the leftover soup (about 1/2 the original batch) and stirred in one cup sour cream. Thoroughly heated. Same great flavor with less beans and lots of vegetables. Hubby loved it and I still give it five stars made both ways. Even better topped with grated cheddar cheese (if you like cheese). Thanks for a great recipe.",

So, I used this recipe as a go by with my limited ingredients.  I used one can of beans and two small chicken breasts.  I added some jalape\u00f1os in the mix and a wee bit of chili powder since we like some layers of spice with our meal.  It would have been better with two cans but I can\u2019t imagine the five cans it calls for.  It really was delicious.",

I fire roasted a fresh jalapeno out of the garden and threw in some leftover grilled corn (cut off cob) and green beans from the night before! IT WAS FANTASTIC! My bf is a pro chef and he was so pleasantly surprised with this. Remember mine was about double the chicken and less than half the beans. I think you can go kind of fast and loose with what you throw in. I did however stick to the spice as called for and it was great! ENJOY:)",
