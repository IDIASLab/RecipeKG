I made the recipe way smaller and still had a ton of leftovers after dinner for two so I can't even picture how much the full recipe would make. I don't like broccoli so I added a zucchini and a portobello mushroom instead. I also used a red onion. I had originally given this recipe a 4/5 and written that I wouldn't make it a weekly meal but it has become one of our all time favourites. Basically like mixing guacamole with a delicious roasted vegetable pasta--yum!",
