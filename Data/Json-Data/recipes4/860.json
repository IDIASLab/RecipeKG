(personal taste)  Don't rinse the kraut.  Keep all that great flavor!  No need to spend time peeling the apples...the skins cook down and get nice and soft, blending in with the kraut.  I decreased the potatoes, cut them into small chunks, and put them on the bottom.  Also, I cooked the stew on LOW for about 7 hours and it was great.  (Stir halfway through to insure even cooking.)  We put swiss cheese on the first serving, but left it off after that.  This dish can stand on its own!  (and I put cheese on EVERYTHING!)  Delicious!!!",

Used 2 lbs unpeeled baby red potatoes and layered on bottom as suggested...this worked great. Apple rings were a little hard to slice would just cut chunks next time and probably add more apples too wouldn't bother peeling next time. The apple flavor got lost with all the kraut and onion. I would add some apple cider to the broth next time or cut it maybe 50/50. This is a delicate recipe and is easy to over cook which I did so the apples dissappeared into mush. Would recommend adding the apples closer to the end next time to keep them crisp. Forgot to put the cheese on top -- I thought something was missing! I used Bavarian style kraut and it was certainly less pungent especially after rinsing... enough so that my picky kids ate a bowlful. Will try this one again making a few alterations. For me time listed is a definitely the maximum this is more of a 1/2 day recipe than an all day recipe. Doesn't get better with extra cooking time. With more apple flavor and crisper veggies/fruit this could be 5 star.",

I will do a few things differently next time though: I'll put the potatoes closer to the bottom so they all get done at the same time. Also I'll put the meat closer to the top so it doesn't get quite as done. And I may use a little less liquid. NOTE: For those who are worried about a too-strong sauerkraut taste use Frank's Bavarian kraut. It's milder and a bit sweeter than regular kraut.",

The previous reviews were very helpful - yes Bavarian style sauerkraut has a nice mild flavor and yes you don't need to add all the potatoes. I made half a recipe becuase I did not want the two of us to be eating it for a week but it was so good that we made it again only a few days later. I did not even bother with the caraway seeds the other ingredients are flavorful enough. I did not serve it with cheese because I didn't have any and it was wonderful anyway.

It allowed all the rest of the flavors to come through too. I used a blend of apples because of what I had on hand and liked the sweet and tart flavors that that added. I did have to cook it a lot longer to have the potatoes cook through even though I made sure they were on the bottom of the cooker.
