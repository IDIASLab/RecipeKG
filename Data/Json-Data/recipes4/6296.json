I have 5 little ultimate critics and they mmmed and ooohed the entire meal too! the sauce was delicious almost onion dip like but perfect for the meal and tasted wonderful when I dipped a piece of chicken in it. I boiled my chicken in salted and peppered water until the water disappeared, only light seasoning is needed and I  used a 9 x 13 lasagna dish and found in had enough sauce, but I wouldn't have complained if I had a little more, (though double would've definitely been way too much). I used Ritz crackers on top because I had no bread crumbs, didn't bother covering it in the oven and 20 minutes did perfect, it was good with the browned cheese. It was pretty set out of the oven but if you use more sauce you might need to let it set a few minutes. Thank you so much for this recipe, from my 7 hungry tummies!! I will make this again and again. Goes great with crusty bread and some steamed veggies.",

One suggestion, double the recipe for a 9x13 pan. I made 1 1/2 the sauce but it was still a little dry. It might be because I used oven ready noodles so that may have been the problem. The bottom layer seemed to get a little over done, dark and crunchy but one guest said that was his favorite part.  I used pre cooked shredded chicken o that made it easy. I also added two layers of yellow squash which definitely was a hit. I also added mozzarella on top.",
