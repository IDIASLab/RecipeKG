Then add the beef, stir-frying in a small amount of oil till it's done to your liking.  Remove and keep warm with the veggies.  THEN add the sauce ingredients and cook about 3 minutes, add corn starch to thicken.   Add the veggies and steak to the sauce, tossing to coat and heat through -- about 1-2 minutes.   \n\nThe steak will be perfectly cooked and your veggies will stay crisp-tender.\n\nWhen I make this recipe I cut back on the vinegar and honey to about 2 TBS each and add some fresh grated ginger and red pepper flakes.\n\nIt's even better then take-out!   This recipe also works well with chicken cut into thin strips or quickly stir-fried shrimp!",

This is a favorite recipe.  Thanks Maria",

Used beef for stir fry already cut into thin strips. I also used low sodium soy and rice wine vinegar instead of the red and reduced it to 1/4c. Hubby loved it and said the sauce was so tasty.....I said its only 3 ingredients....it tasted like so much more. I did thicken the sauce with cornstarch/water. Will most definately make again. This was a great meal and very flavorful! Thanks!",

One trick to try if you have time is to marinate the sliced beef first with soy sauce and minced garlic, along with a pinch of baking soda and about a tablespoon of cornstarch.  Work that mixture into the meat with your hands, then just let it sit for half an hour.  It makes the meat really tender and even more  flavorful.",
