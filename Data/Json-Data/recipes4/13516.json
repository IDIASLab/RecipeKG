We doubled the recipe and were anxious to make it due to the fact that we enjoy that certain \"burrito place\" that they claim it tastes like. However such was not the case. I don't know if it is because we used a rice cooker but it just didn't turn out that well. The taste was a lot more like chicken when I was expecting more lime and cilantro. I would probably cut the chicken bullion is half and add more lime juice and cilantro. Still we put it in burrito shells with seasoned chicken...not too bad not too good.

Anyhow... I used brown rice.....added a can of black beans (drained and rinsed) garlic powder onion powder red pepper flakes and some cumin. Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. It s much better but...when I tasted the original recipe there was NO WAY I would have taken this to a potluck as is because it was just to bland. I have a reputation to uphold...lolol I think it would be best layered into a big ol bathtub burrito as filler (as opposed to an actual side dish).

The chicken bouillon rounded out the flavors and just for a little richness I added a dab of butter. This is a delicately flavored rice perfectly suited for more highly seasoned main dishes.
