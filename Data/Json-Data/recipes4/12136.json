I usually use about 2-3 limes and stuff one of them (or an onion) in the top to keep the steam in the chicken. I also season the beer (you can use sprite or 7-up as well) with some lime juice garlic salt and chopped onions. I have never covered the chicken with foil or basted it and it always comes out nice and golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside. I have also made gravy out of the drippings and it was amazingly good.",

After looking at the reviews and no one else raised this question I thought I was left out of a very special cooks secret. So for all those in the dark as I was you place the can in your required baking dish/tin, opened ease the chickens bottom (sounded better than my first choice) over the opened can, resulting in the chicken facing the skies whilst resting on a can of beer. I am going to give this one tops marks although my chicken really had very little citrus flavour the meat was so very moist that with adjustments in flavouring not only the inside of the chicken but also under and on the skin this could be great.

I made a basic barbecue rub (paprika salt pepper brown sugar onion and garlic etc.) and added a bit of chile powder and cumin to the rub as I thought the Mexican spices would go well with the lime juice. I loosened the chicken skin (just dig your fingers in) put the rub under the skin and on the skin and poured the lime juice under the skin and into the cavity. I stuffed the lime skins in the cavity as directed. I let it sit in the refrigerator for an hour to let it soak up the rub. I opened a can of Really Cheap Beer poured some out added some of the rub to it and lowered the chicken onto it. (We have one of those handy beer can holders from Bed Bath and Beyond or Linens and Things. They really make the whole process a lot easier.) Instead of putting it in the oven I put it on our gas grill set for indirect cooking and cooked it until it reached 180 degrees--about 2 hours. The skin looked really dry but the inside was very moist and tender. Delicious!",

I use Montreal Steak seasoning. Mix 3 Tbsp. Montreal Steak seasoning and 1 Tbsp. Brown Sugar. Rub the outside of the chicken with butter (I have also sprayed it with cooking spray) Then use about a third of the seasoning mix and rub it all around the INTERIOR of the chicken. Rub the remaining seasoning over the outside of the chicken.\"Sit\" the chicken down over the half can of beer. On the grill heat the grill then turn one side off.Set at medium heat. Place the chicken \"sitting up\" on the side that is off (you can use the legs to form a sort of tripod to keep it up) Close the cover and leave it to cook for 1 1/2 hours. It may need a bit more time. But no more than 2 hours! Remove the sitting chicken from the heat let it sit 10 minutes then remove it from the can and cut up. This is THE BEST chicken we've ever had!! It is ALWAYS moist and very flavorful! I have made it in the oven as well. You can use soda in the can but the taste is a little different than with beer. I heard someone say that it is the hops in the beer that infuse the chicken with some of the flavor.",

I squeezed a couple of teaspoons of lime juice into the beer and dropped two cloves of garlic in the can as well. I rubbed the inside and outside of the skin with salt pepper and garlic powder and a little Tony's (cajun seasoning). I did not cover with foil because I LOVE crispy skin!
