I left them whole, as I don't like the meat masserated from cooking so long. We like more texture. I cooked 4 hours & the meat was falling off the bone & the carrots were tender crisp & not mushy. I also sprinkled the tops of hens with Montreal chicken seasoning. Add so much more flavor. I really liked this recipe overall.",
