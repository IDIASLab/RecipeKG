The major changes I made were: 1)I didn't have yellow cake mix so I substituted spice cake (which worked wonderfully esp. since it's autumn) and 2) I used approx. 1/4 to 1/2 cup sherry mixed with powdered sugar for a glaze on top while it was still warm. This inevitably soaked through the cake which made it amazingly moist and delicious!",
