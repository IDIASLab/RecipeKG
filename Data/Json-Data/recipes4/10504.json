I actually went back and reread the recipe several times because I thought I must have missed something. I may try a modified version again if I can think of a way to help them hold their shape a bit more. Again--the flavor was excellant.",

No need for any eggs.\nChopped the carrots and onions very finely.\nSubstituted 1 cup of rice for 1x19oz. can of chick peas also ground finely.\nSubstituted olive oil with healthier and tastier organic virgin coconut oil.\nOnce all ingredients were mixed together it seemed a bit dry so I added a 1/4 cup almond milk.  The consistency was just like a ground beef or turkey mixture perfect for making into patties.  I did add salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, dill weed, and cumin.  I mashed and mixed with my hands ensuring all ingredients were well distributed.  After forming into patties I separated them with wax paper and into Ziplock bag two at a time great for grabbing and making a quick lunch or dinner and into the freezer.  After a half hour in freezer I fried them slowly at medium heat in coconut oil.  They are a huge hit in my house...so tasty...absolutely no crumbling...perfect healthy yummy snack.  We do not eat them as hamburger substitute....we love them alone or in a pita very felafel-like.  Great recipe!!!!",
