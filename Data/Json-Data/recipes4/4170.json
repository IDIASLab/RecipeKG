But I went ahead and made. I had to use Kikkoman Brand Toasted Sesame Marinade, 345 ml size, as the kraft one mentioned is not available in Ontario, but I think this was comparable. I made the ginger/garlic paste as supplied, I couldn't find it in the store, I used boneless breast and bone-in skinless thighs (for more flavour). I left this on low while I went to work (I made the sauce the nite before and food processed it and stuck it in the frig), great smell when I got home. I took chicken out of pot and took out bones and roughly sliced and set aside. Turned up crock pot to high with lid on (10 to 15 min.), then I mixed  about 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and water, and stirred this into sauce in the pot, it thickened up nicely. I used some Thai stick pasta (very thin pasta, that you just soak for 10 minutes in boiling water, drain and its ready) I  mixed everything, including some green beans cooked to still crisp and  mushrooms ) (Get those veggies into meals) This was excellent heated back up the next day, and the next day....",

I really couldn't taste any of those seasonings distinctly which was fine. I think this would benefit from the addition of a sweetener (like honey or orange marmalade) and red pepper flakes (or whole dried red peppers like restaurants use). My husband wasn't wowed by the flavor and I wasn't really exactly impressed either. But this was ready to eat at 5:30 but I had to turn it to \"warm\" and leave it for several more hours due to a family emergency. That this recipe survived being overcooked by 2-3 hours and still gets a 4 says good things for it. Give it a shot if you like these flavors. Served this chopped up over brown rice as written makes PLENTY of sauce. Thanks for the recipe! (Photo coming soon.) P.S.--I too tested this recipe using the LIGHT version of this dressing.",

I followed the recipe exactly. It was promptly named \"nasty chicken\" by my exchange student and my son and has been the joke of our house for a week. It did get eaten with generous amounts of BBQ sauce. I'm giving it 2 stars because if you are not looking for a \"Thai\" dish it is palatable for most American tastes. It was easy to make as the title says. However if you are looking for a \"Thai\" meal this does NOT do the trick.",
