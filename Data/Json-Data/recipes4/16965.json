I steamed the cauliflower that was set aside for 1 minute 15 seconds in the microwave then stirred it in and loved the texture that it qdded to the creamy soup. The fresh dill brought a subtle flavor and unfortunately I forgot the cumin seeds (which were optional anyway). Kac thumbs up on your soup recipe it's a winner!",
