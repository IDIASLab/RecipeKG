The stuffing I made was a bit different from the one described here - mine was all savory, without cranberries or raisins. It was made with stuffing, turkey sausage, sauteed onions with garlic, poultry herbs, and celery. I know that this is a bit of a deviation from the stuffing described in the recipe, but I can assure you that the fundamentals are the same, and the result was INCREDIBLE. The whole point of stuffing is to adjust it to your liking, isn't it? As long as you keep the technique the same, you can't go wrong. All my guests (as well as my husband and myself) were pleasantly surprised by how well it came out. Not to mention that it looked incredibly impressive. I will absolutely be making this recipe again, and it deserves to be made a lot more frequently than just once a year for Thanksgiving!",
