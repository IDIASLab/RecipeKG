I made it to take to a family dinner as my contribution and it was a hit of the night. I did make a risotto to go with it and can definitely recommend pairing the two. It was the hit of the night with everyone asking me for the recipe. Making it again this weekend for a different group of people as I feel confident it will be a success. I only changed one thing I didn't have all the herbs separately so used pre-mixed Italian herbs from a jar but used the same quantity as recipe stated. Worked perfectly.",
