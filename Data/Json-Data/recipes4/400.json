When you cut the pepper in half it looks like a little boat. This keeps the melted cheese from running out.I precook the bacon slightly so that I don't have to turn them and bake them at 400 till the bacon is crisp instead of broiling them. I've been doing this for years and have always had good luck. Joan",

When cooking them the main problem was keeping them in the broiler long enough to get the bacon to crisp up without all of the cheese melting and running out. For the second batch we precooked the bacon about halfway but this only helped slightly. Overall I would not recommend this recipe. It was just not worth the mess for the mediocre results.",
