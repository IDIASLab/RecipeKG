When someone requested this, I thought it would be kind of hard to get the flavors to work, but they do! The bleu cheese lends itself well to the bacon, rosemary, and squash. The carrots add crunch and the onions also go well with the bacon. I would definitely add mushrooms to this! It could be made into a cream soup quite easily, if that's the way you'd rather have it.",
