The texture will be familiar to those of us who have used gelatinized chia and/or flax seeds as an egg substitute. I added some sunflower seeds and dried cherries to up the nutrients. The cherries overpowered the lemon a bit so I would recommend something milder if you want the lemon to really come through. I didn't have any agave syrup but they were still plenty sweet from the honey. Only drawback was my not-so-picky toddler wouldn't finish her slice. More for me!",
