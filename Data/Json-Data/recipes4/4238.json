After reading through the reviews, I consolidated the best changes and I am so glad I did.  Cooked the onions with the mushrooms and added crookneck squash (before it went bad in the fridge as I hate to waste food).  Added a 1/2 tsp of onion powder and a tbsp of hot sauce to the eggs.  Forgot to toast the english muffins, and the strata still turned out fabulous.  Served to 11 women on the last day of our Girl's Weekend and every single one of them asked for the recipe.  Now that's my idea of success!!!  Thanks Shandeen for a wonderful recipe!!!",

The only thing I did different than the directions was cook the onions - added them to the mushrooms when they were about 2/3 done. So simple. Would be a very impressive brunch dish.",

It doesn't make things spicy, but definitely kicks the flavor up. I sauteed all the veggies except for the asparagus and since I used a 9x9 pan, the dish only had to cook for 35 minutes. If I made this for more people, I would definitely add some chopped ham. Thanks for the easy recipe!",
