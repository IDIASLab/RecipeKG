And here it is!  This is so simple, so easy, so quick!  And it tastes good, too!\n\nI did use 3/4 cup fresh lemon juice instead of the water, and I slipped in the zest just before starting the mixer.  I checked it at the one hour mark, needed another 5 minutes (my oven runs a little slow), then it was done.  It looks pretty and tastes wonderful!\n\nThanks to Velda for this yummy recipe.  I'll be making it again.  Probably very soon, when family and friends get a taste of it!",
