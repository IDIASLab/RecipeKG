Worked great. I added some extra garlic and cooked the garlic and onion for a few minutes and then browned the meat in the same pot. After putting it all together I put it in my crockpot on low for about 4. I also added about a tbsp (or a lil more) of fire-roasted chopped green chilies. The fam loved it! Thanks for the recipe!",

My daughter likes corn in chili, so I add that too! :) My latest addition is chilies in Adobo sauce. Adds a nice smokey authentic taste! Add to your taste though, they can get hot if too many.",
