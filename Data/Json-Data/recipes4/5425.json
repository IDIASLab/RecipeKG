I had a hard time finding a round loaf of bread for some reason so I had to resort to \"Plan B\" and hollowed a fresh loaf of Italian bread instead. Even my dad the \"cheese hater\" enjoyed this dip. I found it a tad too rich so I'll probably cut the cream cheese in 1/2 and use 1/2 sour cream if I make this again. THANKS for the recipe Danielle MacDonald!",
