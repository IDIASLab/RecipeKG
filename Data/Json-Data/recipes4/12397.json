Instead of cheddar I used shredded parmesan and next time, I will use a courser grain corn meal (or use what's called \"polenta\" which is even courser ground) and mix it while the water is cold so that it doesn't clump as much. Also, I used the chicken broth as another reviewer mentioned, since it gives it a richer flavor. I think I will also try adding a little bit of sage to make it herbed polenta. Great side dish with cumin & oregano seasoned porkchops and braised kale!",
