(I had over a cup of liquid!) I also added all the cheese to the mix instead of using half for the top. Now it was great!!",

Update:  You must drain the zucchini...  lightly salt the zucchini and let sit for 15 min minimally to weep the zucchini.  Press out any remaining water before adding it to your mix.  Additions you can add to enhance the flavor: grilled corn off the cob, diced sweet red pepper, green ortega chili's, onion, or any type of spicy cheese.",

I used 1/2c cornmeal + 1/2c of AP flour + 1tsp baking powder.  It was really good & no preservatives.\n\nNext time, I'm going to add 1/2c corn kernels.",

It would also be good with Monterey Jack cheese. My suggestions would be: use 1/2-3/4 cup diced onion; be sure to squeeze the water from the grated zucchini before adding (perhaps this is why people are getting gooey results?); add all the cheese except 3/4 cup for topping; and finally wait until the last 15 minutes to add the cheese.  I also covered this with tin foil until the end so it would not scorch the top.  Will make again, it was very easy.",

Family raved about the changes. Otherwise first time: Good zucchini spoonbread. omitted the basil and it tasted great. Maybe could shorten the baking time because the cheese was so done it created a crust.

Added in the cheese to the corn meal and flour mix and the zucchini shreds.  Mixed it all together with about 1/4 cup oil and then put in 425* oven in a hot, oiled cast iron skillet and let bake for 30-40 minutes.
