        "description": "I've never found a recipe I really liked for a savory, au jus-style pot roast without mushy veggies and a weird sweetness. So after some experimenting, this is the way I make it every time now. The tomato sauce disappears and will not make a tomato-flavored gravy. Quick and easy. The roast size and cut can vary, and it will still turn out great. Good for those who don't like onions, although they can be added if you like. I love to make homemade mashed potatoes and dill carrot slices for sides. Cook roast on top of sliced onion rings if desired.",

Would it instead have its own unique flavor?  I probably don\u2019t need to mention that the aroma of this roast filled the kitchen all day, and it was wonderful.  As I was eating this, I completely forgot that I was on the look-out for something unusual, noticing instead that what I was eating was a good old tender pot roast (I used a rump roast which I dredged in flour before browning) with a rich, beefy \u201cjus.\u201d  No one ingredient stood out and in my mind that\u2019s a good thing. So there was nothing particularly different or unusual about this, but I was not disappointed. It was just plain hearty and good.",

I also like the fact you can control the amount of sodium (unlike the recipes that use dry seasoning packets such as onion soup mix,etc).  It's pretty hard to mess up a slow cooker roast, and this recipe resulted in a tasty, tender dinner. I always add onions at the beginning, and add carrots and potatos midway through cook time.\n\nI would like to give the one star reviewer zero stars for mis-using this forum as a grammar/spelling review.  If you haven't tried the recipe, you have no bizznus writing reviews...of anything!  The last time I checked, most grade schools are looking for volunteers, so perhaps that is a better use of your skills and talent :)",

Nobody could guess the secret ingredient (coffee), and there was no trace of tomato either. After the slow cooking process you are left with a rich, beefy jus, and tender fall apart roast.   I also boiled some of the jus along with cornstarch to thicken, and served it on the meat an homemade mashed potatoes. I'm even saving the leftover gravy to liven up some chicken tomorrow.   I'll be making this again for sure!",
