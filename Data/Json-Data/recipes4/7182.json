I served this over English muffins, and it just didn't make sense to cut the hard-boiled eggs in half, so I sliced them.  The sauce was very thick, so I did thin it out with some additional half-and-half, but then it thickened up again in the oven.  I'm not convinced that this needs to bake for 20-25 minutes, and in the future, I'll plan on 10 minutes max.  It had nice flavor, is something a little different, and I'd serve this to company.  Garnished with a sprinkle of paprika, but chopped parsley would be very nice, too.",
