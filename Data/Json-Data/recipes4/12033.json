I used all the same ingredients but I used a cut up fryer sprinked about a teaspoon of salt on it and used white rice instead of brown. I bumped the heat up to 350 and changed the time to 1 hour and covered it with foil for the first half hour then uncovered for the second half. The use of the curry honey and the apples made the dish so flavorful and fall-like I served it with some acorn squash...It was wonderful!",

The chicken itself was edible. The filling was more like a paste than rice one that was too earthy with not even a hint of the honey/maple flavor remaining. The apple pieces no longer tasted anything like apples. I also truly love spicy foods but this recipe had all of the heat that I love with none of the flavor to make the heat worthwhile. I've been faithfully using allrecipes.com for about 5 years now and this is the first recipe that I consider beyond help.",
