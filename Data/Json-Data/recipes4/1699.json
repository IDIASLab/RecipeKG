The second one with tomato in between sprinkled with a bit of salt and cracked black pepper.  These would be great with tomato soup!",

Still I made this 8 times over several days using up almost a whole loaf of sourdough bread. I made it exactly as written; the \"outside\" step is a little messy but kind of a neat idea and works well - the outside becomes golden and slightly cheesy. I'm not sure I'd ever made a grilled cheese sandwich in a skillet before (though I think that's the usual way) but it works well. I enjoyed this recipe and highly recommend it.",

The Paremsan I had was the shredded kind--not the powdery version which most everyone gets. After buttering the bread I sprinkled the shredded parmesan on and then gently pressed with a knife to get it to stick. I cooked it in my George Forman grill. The sandwich came out a nice golden brown and the cheese on the inside was perfectly melted. I think it was the parmesan on the outside that gave it a little different taste. Very good. I will be making this again! Great with tomato soup.",
