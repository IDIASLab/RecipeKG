I had to make enough for a side dish for my Class of 2000 reunion BBQ so I calculated the recipe for 70 and I used 3 gallon size cans of Bushes pinto beans. I used lots of garlic (I didn't measure) but I used all of the other ingredients to the exact measurements they were calculated out for. I cooked and crumbled the bacon into the tomato mixture and saved the tomato mixture for the next day. We were traveling so it went with us on ice. I added the beans and simmered everything together for 20 minutes then headed out the door. I only heard positive remarks about the recipe and even bean haters said they loved them. The only problem I came across was that the chili powder was not listed in the directions. I added it to the tomato mixture but still had to give this recipe 5 stars. My husband is a bean hater and told me I had permission to cook these again in the winter and he would eat them.",

If I happen to have a ham bone I'll use it and chunks of ham instead of bacon. I also add a jalapeno when boiling for more flavor with a kick. The secret is the added tomato mixture and letting the flavors meld together. We make a meal out of it with cornbread on the side. NOTE: This is not a chili recipe so you'll have to hunt the website a little longer if that's what you are looking for. These are just good old fashioned Southern comfort food.",
