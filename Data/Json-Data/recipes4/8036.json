This is soup.. there is NO broth or water listed. Without it, it would make sauced turkey. I made some stock with the leftover turkey carcass and use that.. You probably will need 10-12 cups of stock for a full recipe. This would have gotten 5 stars, except for the error.. which is missing from the personal recipe as well.",
