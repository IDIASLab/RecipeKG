I changed the recipe a little as per reviews on another Jalape\u00f1o Bacon Deviled Eggs recipe and also the ingredients I had on hand. I doubled the amount of bacon and mixed it all in with the yoke mixture instead of garnishing the tops. Instead of fresh Jalape\u00f1o I used 1/3 cup of sliced jalape\u00f1os from a jar, diced up pretty small. Since it was recommended on another review, I added a couple tbsps of the bacon grease to the yoke mixture which was FANTASTIC! Also added Sriracha to taste because we like things on the spicier side! Will totally make again for future dinner parties!",
