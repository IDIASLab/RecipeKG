I turned the crockpot off and left it in there until the rest of the meal was done.  I strained the juices into a pot and mixed in the packet of gravy that came with my turkey breast from Target.

Thus, I 4x everything in the recipe except Parsley & Thyme because I ran out of both so subbed the difference with Herbs de Provence and only 3 TBS of Soy because I try and watch the sodium.  I again mixed all with a mixer to 'whip' as I don't believe Philly makes whipped garden veg cheese (at least in my area, we only can find regular garden veg).  4x may have been extreme as this breast was loaded up with the heavenly cheese/butter mixture to the point I felt a bit guilty.  I'd say I'm discarding about 1/4 cup.  I'm also using a Slow Cooker Liner this time and going for 2 hours on high, then 6 on low and then I'll warm it till dinner time as I got this going at 9am.  I also have another tub of the cream cheese which I will add to the mash potatoes as that worked quite well last time.",

My turkey breast half weighed just under 2 1/2 lbs but I made the entire amount of butter/cream cheese mixture. I put it liberally on both sides of the turkey breast and cooked it on high for 2 hrs. and 45 minutes which in my crock pot was just a bit too long. Next time I will start checking it at 2 1/2 hours if not sooner. This was good but I m not sure I liked the cream cheese in this. I like making a turkey breast in a crock pot but next time I think I will just season it with Sarah s Dry Rubbed Chicken seasoning also on this site.",
