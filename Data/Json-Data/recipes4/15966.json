I didn't bother with low-fat turkey sausage because I felt like I could splurge since the rest of the meal was so healthy. Thanks a lot, I will definitely make this my go-to Cajun rice and beans recipe!",

I simmered my beans for an additional half-hour after an overnight / most-of-the-day-soak, then rinsed them again and started with fresh water for following the recipe. We've made it with both green peppers and green chiles, and love it both ways. My brown rice is never as done as I want it to be, so I mix it (after it's been simmering for 45 unsuccessful minutes) in for the last 15 minutes or so. Without it, the beans are soupy but delicious. With it, it's a bit more like a stick-to-your-ribs standard beans 'n rice recipe. Either way, my family loves it, more than I expected them to, and with or without sausage of any kind.",
