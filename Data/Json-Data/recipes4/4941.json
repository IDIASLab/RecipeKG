It adds a great, smoky flavor and the other spices blend well to enhance the flavor of the pork without overpowering it.  One suggestion: I mixed the Worcestershire and the liquid smoke, rubbed it on the pork and then mixed the dry ingredients and used them as a rub.  In my opinion, to have mixed the wet and dry ingredients would have led to a pasty mess, which would have been difficult to spread evenly on the meat.  This is definitely in my file of \"do agains.\"",

When rubbed onto the chops i was worried that this mixture wouldnt stay but much to my surprise it was absorbed and none of it fell off.  THis was my first time using liquid smoke, it adds an awesome flavor and my entire family gobbled this up.  I doubled the batch for my husband and myself and our 5 kids and everyone just loved it! Awesome recipe, I have printed this recipe and added it to my book and WILL be making this regularly for my family! THANK YOU!!",

                "reviewBody": "Wow! Thanks for the great reviews everyone. I'm so glad most of you enjoy this recipe. I created it about 20 yrs ago after a lot of trial and error. My family and friends think it's the best rub for pork chops and I'm so happy to see that many of you agree! Thanks again!\n\nEdit: For those who are having trouble with the mixture staying on the meat, you are supposed to massage the mixture into the meat with your hands to ensure that it adheres well. Do not just sprinkle it on the meat like you do with some seasonings. It's basically a rub that has liquid in it. It is more like a thin paste rather than a marinade or a dry rub.\n\nEdit April 2014: I see some reviews saying this rub is too wet and does not work as a rub. Guys! Follow the directions! Rinse your chops but do not pat dry. Mix the ingredients as listed. Do NOT change the recipe then say it doesn't work. If you follow the instructions, you will find a very good rub for pork chops, chicken and beef steaks. Really, you will!\n\n12/13/14: I am so happy that so many people love this rub. It truly makes me feel very good. I understand that some find it too salty...but then, that is is their issue and they can adjust it for salt per their preference. What I do not get are those who are not following the directions, then saying it's not working for them. They are not following the directions then. This recipe is a wet rub...not a dry one. From the many, many positive reviews, it's clear most folks are getting it.",

These chops definitely have a wonderful \"smoky\" flavor and the rub definitely compliments the Worcestershire and liquid smoke combination.
