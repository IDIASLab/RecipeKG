I had the recipe printed out and I had to give it away that night because someone wanted the recipe. I'll most likely be making this again. Thank you.",

My friend suggested thinning it down a little bit with either milk or half and half saute the peppers and onions with the sausage and serving it over pasta for a meal.

I cooked the sausage in the skillet first to drain the fat. Then I let it simmer with everything else on low for a couple of hours otherwise you'll want to cook on high for an hour so the veggies are soft. It was not runny & still very tasty despite the cut in sour cream & cream cheese. It was gone in minutes! Also recommend a crock pot liner to cut down on cleaning time.",
