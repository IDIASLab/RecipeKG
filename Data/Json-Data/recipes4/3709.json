I live in Albuquerque, born and raised and any lesser cut would work just fine!  We never put beef in our Green Chile Stew just pork!  Do use the masa, it adds depth to the stew and remember if you are not from around this part of the country that if you have fresh green chili that you need to roast it first.  There are several ways to do it:  You can put it on a pan and broil it, turning it when each side gets black and blistered.  You can put it on your outside grill, or my preferred method for just a few chilis at a time, I roast them on the top of my gas range.  After blistering the skin, put them into a large resealable bag and let them steam for about 15 minutes then peel off the charred outer skin.  To tell if your chili is hot, look at the stem end.  The more points it has, the hotter it is.  If you don't want you chili hot remove the stems and seeds.  Enjoy!",

What I did differently was, I left out the beef and doubled the pork (we didn't have any beef on hand), I substituted whole wheat flour for the masa harina, used sweet yellow onions instead of red (my husband's preference), and coriander instead of cilantro.  One thing I did also was substitute a rutabega for the potato, in order to cut the carbohydrate count considerably (we try to watch our starches when we can).  This was so wonderful, and even though it may seem like a lot of prep at first glance, was quite easy.  We served it to guests on Halloween and they all loved it!",
