Since I couldn't do the half star...I'm going 5 because of the simplicity.  Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe. \n",

I thinly sliced an onion and smashed 3 cloves of garlic.  All of this went on a 6 lb. tenderloin for Christmas dinner.  It took about 1 hour and 10 minutes to reach rare-med. rare stage.  Absolutely delicious!  Added fresh mushrooms around it for the last 20 minutes or so, rolled them in the pan gravy as they cooked.  For gravy, after I removed the roast from the pan to rest, I put the roasting pan over 2 burners, added a can of beef broth and some water/cornstarch. Brought to a boil stirring constantly and cooked down just a bit.  Super delicious!  So glad to know how to cook a tenderloin now.  Thank you for such a super recipe!!!!",

Given the size of our crowd, I knew I wanted to feed everyone well but I didn't want to make a boring old ham so I took a chance and cooked a beef tenderloin for the very first time based solely on this recipe and reviews and I am so glad I did.   I sliced up two huge sweet onions to put on the bottom of my roasting pan.  I placed ten pounds of tenderloin (Costco size pieces) in the pan and topped it with the butter and soy sauce.  I inserted the thermometer and let it go.  About 30 minutes prior to the meat being fully cooked I added about a half pound of sliced mushrooms to the pan.  This was the best beef ever and I might even like it more than the melt-in-your-mouth prime rib I usually make every Christmas.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!",

Cut back on the soy sauce and replace it with low/no sodium beef broth and reduce the butter by half and I think it might be ok. My husband and I are not the most health conscious eaters but we both needed to have several glasses of water to rehydrate after dinner. We also though it could use a few herbs to add layers of flavor. Hope this helps!",
