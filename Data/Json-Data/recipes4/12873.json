I ended up making 3 pork chops because I had a lot of the apple and cheese mixture. However that is likely my fault because I didn't measure anything and just dumped. Anyway so I increased the sauce by 1/2 to accommodate for that change. I thought that it was a bit difficult to wrap the pork chops around the mixture and bf was cranky about the toothpicks in the pork. I didn't chop the apple very finely; I'd recommend doing so or maybe even making an apple pesto in the food processor. Bf thought they'd be better with sweeter apples. Thanks for the recipe.",

Browned the pork loin then covered and let cook without adding the vinegar or water (and without making a gravy at the end). We chose to reserve some of the apple to marinate with red onion and champagne vinegar with a touch of apple cider vinegar. After the pork loin was finished we added the apple/onion mixture to the pan to deglaze and added some steamed kale. Reserved a bit of uncooked apple and shredded cheese to top the pork loin and apple/onion/kale mix once done. Great flavors together thanks so much for posting this recipe.",

It's much better less tough and more flavorful you get 2 servings per 1/2 a tenderloin (they usually come cut lengthwise). Second reduce cooking time in half. All you need is 15 minutes for it to be done properly. Third ditch the toothpicks. Use roasting twine and tie up the meat once rolled. Also red wine is a good hack instead of vinegar if you don't have red wine vinegar.",
