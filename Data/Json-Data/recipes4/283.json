I was surprised that the canned soup taste wasn't so \"canned\" tasting.  I layered in one layer of swiss cheese and one layer of mozzarella.  The swiss cheese gave it a nice bite.  I also added the dijon mustard to the soup mixture as suggested by another reviewer. I will make this again.  It makes a lot, so I'll be eating it for lunch all week!  That's not a bad thing, I just hope I don't eat it all by myself.",

I started by soaking regular lasagna noodles in a large pan filled with hot water to make them pliable enough to build the dish. I simmered the sauerkraut with onion, a little brown sugar and caraway seeds and boiled the kielbasa to remove some of the salt. Instead of the soups, I chose to make a white sauce which worked out fine. This morning Rachel Ray made a \"mile high\" lasagna using a loaf pan lined with foil so I followed her lead and did the same thing. Once out of the oven, I let it sit for a good 45 minutes to allow it to set up. It cut beautifully and my hubs thought this was absolutely terrific. Thanks so much Don!",

The flavor of the recipe is good (if you like sausage and sauerkraut and I'm a sauerkraut FREAK!) so I'd probably try this again but probably with a different noodle (thin layers of egg noodles? AND more sauerkraut!) or layers of par-boiled thin slices potatoes. And it's really easy to put together if your a sauerkraut FREAK like me who always has sauerkraut in her pantry.",
