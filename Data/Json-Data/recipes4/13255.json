I befriended a woman who worked there and she gave me the recipe. It's very versatile. Small pieces of meat or seafood can be added. It's thick and great in the winter and can be made very mild or very spicy. I've seen some recipes on the internet for this dish that are the American version. They may be good too but this one is authentic.",

I bought dried anchovies (take out the intestine/gut whatever) into a pot with water the garlic, onion, shitake mushrooms and dried kelp! Bring up to a boil for 5 mins on high, then an extra 15-20 mins on low. Then remove the shitake mushrooms and chop them up into small pieces. Then using your clay pot whatever you're using, could be a large sauce pan,  with cooking oil, cook the beef with the korean chili powder. Once the beef is almost brown, add the korean fremented chili paste and the shitake mushrooms. Add the broth into the sauce pan (avoid picking up the anchovies, onion, and garlic :) ). Add the soft tofu. Add a teaspoon of fish sauce (or whatever to your liking, this can be omitted) Once it starts boiling, add the crack egg. Add a teaspoon of seseme oil! it gives a great smell and makes the soup a little more tasty!",

I've been making it without the soybean paste and the soup was never as tasty as this. I didn't have ground beef but while frying the chilli powder I crumbled up some dried soup anchovies instead. I added some mixed seafood at the same time I dropped in the soft tofu along with some chopped jalapeno peppers. It tastes authentic like the ones you purchase from the Korean restaurants.

I used ground venison instead of beef and black sesame seeds as they were what I had on hand. I also replaced the water with beef broth and I lessened the amount of tofu used as the package I purchased was not 12 oz. My aunts truly enjoyed it; thank you susi EM for posting this easy stew recipe! Next time I may take other reviewers suggestions and add some shittake mushrooms.",
