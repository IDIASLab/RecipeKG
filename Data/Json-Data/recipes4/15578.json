I got the sauce going as directed (in a pot), but I added more water and continued adding water as necessary so it could cook together nicely without getting too thick or burning. We were low on money so I used ground chuck, browned it, and then added it to the sauce as instructed. I let that cook for a couple if minutes as I boiled the noodles, and then as my noodles were finishing I melted the cream cheese into the sauce. This is a delicious, very easy dinner! It also re-heated very well.",

I didn't use as much cream cheese as the recipe called for (I used about 5oz) but still had a really nice consistency to the sauce. My beef did get a little tough. Not sure why I asked the butcher for stew beef. I might have left the crockpot on high a little too long. It's def something my partner wants me to make again! And it was quick and easy. I paired it with some egg noodles and a salad.",

I took another reviewer's advise and only used half of the onion soup powder. It turned out great! Husband loved it and has requested we add this to our rotation. I used about 1.3 pounds of stew cubes from the store and I think if I had cut them smaller I could easily doube the rest of the recipe and have more than enough for guests. I am anxious to see how it fairs as a reheated leftover.",
