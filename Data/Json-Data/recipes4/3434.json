I used a t. of chili powder, a t. of red pepper flakes, and no green chili peppers, and it was still pretty spicy.  (I guess that would depend on how hot your salsa is too.)  This recipe was SOOOO good though, it's nice that you can just change it to your liking if it is too spicy!  Next time I will do what I did this time, but just leave out the red pepper flakes and I think that will do it.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

I made in the slow cooker by browning the turkey garlic onion and peppers and then just placed everything in the slow cooker for about 10 hours. I tasted after about 5 hours a tad on the sweet side for me so I added a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and an extra pinch of salt. This smelled so good cooking! Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe Kate. The only thing missing were the extra calories!",
