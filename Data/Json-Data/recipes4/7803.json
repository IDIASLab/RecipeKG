This is how my family enjoys this pizza, but feel free to add or omit any of our toppings. Don't use the cheese, use the cheese, or change the cheese to your favorite flavor. Possibilities are endless - bottom line - I hope you enjoy our Hawaiian BBQ pizza!",

We made half with ham and pineapple and half with chicken and green peppers. Cheddar cheese melted nicely over the entire pizza and we cooked it on the BBQ I just lightly coated one side of the crust with olive oil first and grilled it for a few minutes on high and then flipped it over and assembled the pizza. Thanks Molly will make it again and again",
