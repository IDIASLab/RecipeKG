I used a Red Delicious Apple and I also threw in just a bit of chopped celery and some dried cranberries. I mixed the dressing in a separate bowl before folding it into the chicken and other ingredients. For the dressing I used Hellman's light mayo and cut it with a bit of reduced fat sour cream. I used half apple pie spice and half curry powder along with a bit of salt and pepper. It chilled for just a couple of hours and it came out really good. Overall a great combination of flavors!",

It tastes good, and the presentation is lovely.",
