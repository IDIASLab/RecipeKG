Regardless of the size roast you have, you do NOT need to submerge the entire thing in liquid - whether you use an oven or crock pot.  I used only 1 bottle of beer and 1 cup beef stock instead of water - enough to go 1/2 way up the roast - like when you're braising meat.  Most of liquid needs to be thrown out anyway.  After it's done, I usually preserve about 1/2 - 2/3 cup liquid before adding the BBQ sauce to save all those nice beef drippings.  You can have BBQ shredded beef one day and save half (b4 adding bbq sauce) for shredded beef tacos with soft tortillas the next.",

I'm making it tonight and had to print out the recipe again and thought I would leave a review. This recipe also works well with country-style pork ribs in the slow cooker for shredded pork sandwiches.",

HOWEVER the cooking technique is awesome; shredded beautifully in 5 hours in the oven. Ingredient-wise unless you are a HUGE fan I would drop the liquid smoke and also only use 1 bottle of beer. Two teaspoons is WAY too much. Made it again with 1/2 t. smoke and still just - too much. I would say it actually ruins a good basic recipe. Your BBQ sauce will probably be enough for infusing that smokey flavor. Like others I drain the liquid and only add back in if I need to adjust the consistency.",
