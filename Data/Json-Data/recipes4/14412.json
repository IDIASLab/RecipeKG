I also added a spoonful of Better Than Bouillon No Chicken Base. I also cooked the quinoa separately from the rest. When I make this again I will also not use as much quinoa. I ended up having some leftover that I will have to use for something else. I would try to start with 1 1/2 cups to start. I sauteed fresh garlic shallots and fresh minced ginger. I also drained the chick peas and added them to the pan with the garlic shallots and ginger to cook them a bit. I added the cinnamon and cumin cooked everything for a few minutes then added the cooked quinoa. I didn't have any mint but I used fresh sweet basil and parsley. I also had about a cup of yellow raisins (which I plumped with hot water as the directions said). I mixed everything in to the pan with the quinoa shallots and spices and let it simmer for a few minutes. Shredded raw carrots were added. I also added a tablespoon or so of extra veggie broth while everything was in the pan to give it a little more flavor. Definitely don't skip the lemon juice either. I think it ties the whole thing together nicely. I only had a spoonful while it was still warm but already it tastes awesome. I'm sure once it chills and the flavors meld a bit more it will be a new favorite. Thanks for the recipe!",
