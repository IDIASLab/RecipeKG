She would use mozzarella instead of provelone and would use Italian Sausage as the base. She would also kick it up by adding parmesan or romano cheese to the sausage-cheese mixture. The more the more decadant. Can also make with frozen spinach in lieu of sausage. Basically a mini calzone and oh so yummy. Don't be afraid to add oregano. This freezes well too.",

I used mozzarella Italian three cheese blend Italian sausage and a sprinkling of oregano. I didn't use the amount of cheese/eggs suggested and I had more then enough filling. I may turn the oven down and cook for longer next time; the outside was beginning to get dark brown when the inside was still doughy. (Any suggestions anyone??) Delicious - Thanks Jo Ann!",
