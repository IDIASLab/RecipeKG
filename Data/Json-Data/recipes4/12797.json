I don't think I'd consider the wine optional in this recipe since it's what makes it special. Also another reviewer mentioned that they subbed cream of mushroom for the golden mushroom soup. That might do in a pinch but they are very different things- I think the golden mushroom is more like a gravy. Thanks for this recipe Amber- it was very very good.",

The fresh mushrooms really make the difference and so does the wine...I don't recommend leaving it out. Also added a cup of reduced sodium broth to cover the meat but that made it a tad too salty so I will use water next time or a mix of broth and water. We don't even like mushrooms that much but this was super easy and delicious and the meat was very tender. I served it over egg noddles and even my 4-yr old who hates everything ate some.",
