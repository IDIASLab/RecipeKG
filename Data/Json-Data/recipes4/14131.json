The ingredients temperature and time (30 minutes) are spot on and create perfectly crisp beautifully golden nicely shaped puffs. Make sure to cut them open to release the steam soon after removing them from the oven and scoop out any gooey dough still in the center. I make the first part on the stove and remove the ball of dough to my kitchen aid stand mixer for about 5 minutes then beat the eggs in one at a time until completely blended. I place them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet forming with my cookie scoop and get a much higher yield than 8... For half a recipe I get about twelve just the right size for filling with pastry cream. I usually put three per plate and drizzle them with chocolate sauce. I have also tried filling them with smoked salmon sour cream and capers and loved it. The possibilities are endless.",
