These two are the only changes I made. This recipe is NOT for the faint of heart! It IS spicy but very good! The yogurt lends a cooling touch but it will still bring a lot of heat! The only improvement I can think of would be to add some julienned carrots and maybe some snow peas. Overall it is a great recipe but lacks the deep Asian notes I was searching for.",
