Either have a cup of butter beans (large dried limas) you have previously soaked and cooked to use in this recipe or use a (15 oz.) can of large butter beans 1 tsp. of pimento berries is far too much, and will overpower the flavor of the entire dish!  Try 1/2  tsp. instead.  Lastly if you do not like peppery hot food,  substitute 1/2 cup chopped bell pepper instead.",

The only changes I made were using a few dashes of scotch bonnet pepper hot sauce (didn't have a pepper on hand) and I used dried thyme instead of fresh. When cooking the oxtail in the pan, make sure there are no onions, etc. with it otherwise the onions will burn. Instead of a pressure cooker, I cooked everything in my slow cooker on high for 6 hours - the meat was falling off the bone! Simply tender and delicious. I would omit the beans next time I make this - just didn't need it. I served them over hot cooked rice. Will DEFINITELY be making this delicious meal again and again! ",

There are two important differences with her recipe however - first 1 pound of Oxtail does not go far - cook at least 2 Lbs. Secondly she always adds up to 1/2 bottle of Red Wine - usually a Spanish Rioja after the Pressure Cooking Stage. You also may not want to thicken the gravy with Cornstarch - it's a question of taste & texture. Fayva Beans - Lima beans - Butter Beans - Broad Beans are more or less the same thing.",

The scotch bonnet I used was a lot stronger than I expected so next time I would just use half instead of a whole one.  But it was still fabulous and falling off the bone.

Using a pressure cooker, this was a one pot meal.\n\nI changed the recipe ever so slightly because I was a little confused with the instructions.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I browned the oxtail on both sides in the pressure cooker.  I added some oxtail seasoning I found in the grocery store to the meat.  After browning, I removed the oxtail from the cooker, and sauteed the onions and green peppers in the pressure cooker and then added the garlic, ginger (bottled), soy sauce, thyme, salt and pepper.  I then returned the oxtails to the pressure cooker, added the water, and cooked the meat under pressure for 25 minutes.\n\nI followed the recipe exactly from this point on.  I really like the taste of the butter beans (thanks to the person who explained that broad beans are butter beans).  Yum!  The meat was tender, the gravy was great, and it didn't take 6+ hours to complete:)",
