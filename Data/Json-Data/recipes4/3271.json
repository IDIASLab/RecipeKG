Changed the method of preparation a bit by doubling the amount of pepper & flour with the same amount of salt and putting it into a plastic bag and coating the pieces of short ribs inside the plastic bag before cooking the ribs.  Didn't use the beer.  After deglazing the pan with water & 2 beef bouillon cubes (we were out of beef stock), everything was put into a roasting pan.  Baked the ribs in the oven with the cover on at 325 for almost 2 hours.  ( Watch so that the liquid doesn't run dry in the roaster ).  They turned out very tender and tasty.    May use a crock pot the next time these are made as others have suggested.  Thank You for posting.  It's a keeper.",

It took approx. 45 minutes to dredge and brown the ribs.  I didn't increase the amount of the liquid though.  The amount given in the recipe worked fine for the 4 pounds of meat.  I used my Lodge cast iron dutch oven which has a heavy lid and doesn't allow much liquid to cook out.  It worked wonderful for the ribs.  After about two hours the meat was falling off the bone.  The flavor was great.  We ate it with a nice crusty bread and sopped up the juice.  Divine !!!  It was nice to find a rib recipe that doesn't rely on a sweet barbecue sauce.  I will definitely make this again and again.",

I added a mix of paprika, chili powder, brown sugar, cayenne and garlic powder to the flour/salt/pepper to dredge the ribs in before browning.  It gave them a delicious, crunchy crust.  Place the browned ribs in a large slow cooker then cook the onions and garlic in the same skillet.  Before removing the onions/garlic deglaze the pan with the beer.  Pour this mixture over the ribs along with the beef stock. I also added a few squirts of Worchestershire to the liquid.   Lay a large stem of rosemary and a couple stems of sage on top of everything.  (If desired, add chopped carrots and mushrooms).  Cook on high for 5 hours.  Slightly thicken the sauce with a flour/water mix 1 hour before serving.",
