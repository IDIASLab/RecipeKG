I made several: a few following the recipe exactly; a few with ham and swiss cheese; a few with sausage, caramelized onions, and mushrooms; and one with spinach and the caramelized mushrooms and onions.  I made them all ahead of time and let them sit in my refrigerator (always helps to have a second one!) and although transporting them wasn't easy, cooking them was!  I had to extend the time in a commercial oven because of the number I had, but other than that, they were a hit! I cooked up some sausage links on the side and also had a tray of caramelized onions and mushrooms if people wanted any on the side.  For something quick, hot, and tasty -- you cannot go wrong with this recipe!  5/3/09: If at possible, I think I might have even improved on this recipe, a family favorite at our house.  I was making this last night and discovered I was short on eggs.  What to do? I searched fridge and found ricotta cheese.  Followed the recipe exactly using Jimmy Dean Hot & Spicy sausage, some rosemary foccacia bread that had started to get a little stale, which I cubed, 4 eggs, and 1/2 cup of the ricotta cheese.  Everything else was the same.  I let it sit overnight in the fridge and cooked it in the morning.  A total hit and my husband said he couldn't believe how creamy it was.  Nice change, but true to the original.",

I also used pre sliced French bread (it was not thick sliced) and didn't cube it.  I lined a 9x13  dish w/the bread, topped w/the chopped sausage and sauteed green onions and 1/2 of the egg mix  then another layer of bread and finished w/the rest of the egg mix and topped with cheese.  The slices gave it a very pretty, uniform look and it ended up being like a stuffed, savory french toast -  YUM!  It was all gone but one piece that I ate later!  I can recommend this recipe.",

The sausage & cheddar was good but tasted a lot like pizza.  Only modification I made to the recipe was using slightly more bread (husband's preference).  Making it again tomorrow, this time with bacon & a mix of cheddar & jack cheeses since that's what I have on hand.  Easy way to use up day-old bread.",
