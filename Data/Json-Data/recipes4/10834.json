I usually first bring the water to boil then add the rice and let it boil until the rice rises to the top. Then I drain the rice add 2 or 3 Tablespoons of oil mixed with half a cup of water in the pot before I mix the other ingredients with the rice and put it back into the pot. Then I cook the rice on medium heat for 5 minutes and then reduce the heat and cook the rice for the remaining time already mentioned in the original recipe. I hope this helps in motivating more people to make this dish. Viostars idea of mixing the oil with the rice and herbs is also good. Note: You can use lima beans from the freezer section in your grocery store instead of fresh fava beans. Thank you....Neda",

When I prepare the rice I rinse it then put it in boiling water for 5-8 minutes, drain rice in a strainer, dry pot out with a towel and pour the vegetable oil on the bottom, mix rice with herbs & favas then transfer rice to pot and cook on low for 45 minutes. Make sure to wrap a towel around the pot lid so it absorbs the water that would fall back in the rice otherwise, try it trust me it makes a difference. ",

He used the towel over the pot before replacing the lid method which helped form the tadig perfectly.  Before sealing the pot with the towel, he would mound the rice and dill mixture up into a \"hill\" in the pot and sprinkle quite a bit of turmeric on top making a golden surface to the hill.  He said it is traditional for each person to get some of the tadig to crunch along with the softer rice.  I miss him greatly and cook his \"legacies\" often.  My very American son is addicted to this one.",

And the rice is supposed to be slightly stuck I usually just slide something under it and then place it back on top of the serving dish of rice.
