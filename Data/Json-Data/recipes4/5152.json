If you you love curry I suggest to double the amount.\n\nThe reason I have to reduce your recipe to four stars is because the baking time of 90 minutes for this amount of boneless chicken is overkill that creates tough dried out meat. For moist tender chicken check for doneness at 40 to 45 minutes.",

I used regular cream of mushroom soup instead of the lower-sodium option which was a mistake. Between the salt in the soup and the salt in the Cheddar cheese this was darn near uneatable. Of course my tolerance for salt has decreased dramatically over time so its likely I'm more sensitive to it than the average person. Nontheless those of us watching our sodium levels might find this too salty to bear. On the positive side the flavor of this dish was excellent and I'm going to give it a try with some changes. Specifically I'll try it with the raw chicken breasts next time I'll use the lower sodium mushroom soup and a different brand of cheese since the one I used was over-salty in another recipe I made too. Also I'll serve it with steamed (and unsalted!) rice which will help cut the salt impact. Yes it tasted good enough to try it again and hopefully I can give it a higher rating next time! Oh - one more thing. Since several people complained it was too watery I mixed in 1.5T of flour with the soup/garlic/curry mix. This provided a slight thickening of the gravy that was just perfect.",
