The only issue in the recipe is the thick sauce and how much it calls for. I think it would be more enjoyable with a lighter sauce and less of it. I ended up thinning it out with some white wine and using only half of it in the final preparation. I found that this was sufficient to lightly coat everything adding some creaminess but not tasting like pasta and gravy. I blanched the peas and asparagus having cooked them briefly in a large pot of water, then using the same water to cook the pasta. The fresh flavours of the veggies mixed so well with the salty prosciutto crudo I was tempted to eat them all on their own. Thank you champ for your recipe!",
