This was the first recipe we used with cracked wheat and it was delicious. Because of past experiences with wheat flour we feared this bread would be dense but it was far from it with a hint of sweetness. Like another reviewer we found the bread needed to rise longer than specified (ours took over an 1 hour on the first rise and an 1 1/2 hour on the second rise). But don't let this stop you from using this recipe this will be our go-to wheat bread from now on. Thanks for the recipe.",
