Maybe I should have used instant/minute rice - the recipe does not specify. Or maybe the time should have been scaled since the dish was scaled. In any event I tried cooking some of the leftovers in the crock pot the next day and at the 5-hour mark - on High the rice still was not cooked enough to eat.",

First of all, I added 1 cup of corn, 2 cups of chopped kale, 1/2 cup of water to moisten the rice, and a can of kidney beans.  I left out the butter and onion (Did not have an onion), so I chopped up the chicken, kept it raw, and threw EVERYTHING into a casserole dish, stirred it up, covered with foil (VERY important), and cooked for about 80 minutes. Only one dish, topped with sour cream, quite healthy and delicious!  Keep an eye on the rice to see it does not run dry.  If you have too much moisture at the end, take the foil off and bake for additional 5-10 minutes.",
