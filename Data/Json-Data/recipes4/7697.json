Will say taste was good.\" This recipe goes by many a name in similar forms on AR; crustless quiche, low carb egg bake etc ... sometimes done in muffin cups or a baking dish. I was only feeding two of us, so I halved all of the ingredients and made it in a glass pie dish. Also used fresh spinach rather than frozen. While the taste of this was good, the ability to cut it nicely and its texture wasn't, and this must've due to the spinach being layered on the bottom alone, followed by the peppers/onions/bacon, and the eggs being poured on top, rather than what I wish I'd have done instead: beat the eggs in a large bowl and stir in all of the other ingredients and pour THAT into the baking dish. Layering it just didn't make sense, and it left the spinach fairly bland on its own, soggy on the bottom. I have every intention of making this type of dish again, but since I'd change the directions (along w/ swapping garlic salt for fresh minced garlic, and adding mushrooms I think), the recipe would change too much to really be this one anymore.",

One thing I really like about this recipe is that I can see a lot of ways to modify it to suit my own tastes. For instance the red pepper is a bit too \"sweet\" for me so the next time I won't use them and I might just use green onions to take the place of both the onions and the peppers. Sausage instead of bacon? Ground beef? Maybe some Greek seasoning? Italian? A person could go a lot of different directions with this!",

I've kind of doubled it as my pan is larger than the size called for and I also use different cheese. I've found the fiesta blend from Walmart or Colby Jack both work great. I actually prefer them to the asiago and Monterey Jack. Just my opinion. This is great for quick breakfasts. Just make it on the weekend and you have breakfast all week or take the whole pan to work and feed your coworkers. They'll thank you for this one! I promise!",
