                "reviewBody": "Excellent recipe! Easy to make, full of flavor, and open to variation based on preferences and what\u2019s available in the pantry (this recipe is quite forgiving). Here are mine:\n\nUse a large crock pot. Additional ingredients: 1 chopped green pepper and 1T each of nutmeg, cumin, and smoked paprika. Save the collard greens as a garnish.\n\nMix the stock, tomatoes, peanut butter, and seasonings in the crock. If you\u2019re preparing in the morning, set crock to low; otherwise, set to high.\n\nSaut\u00e9 the onion and green pepper; add the garlic about a minute before you are done saut\u00e9ing. Add to the crock.\n\nAdd the chunked sweet potatoes. Don\u2019t bother peeling, just give them a good scrub. The skins are full of nutrients and they\u2019ll soften.\n\nAdd whole, uncooked chicken breasts (thawed or frozen). After a few hours, remove chicken and shred by pulling apart with two forks (I prefer the look and texture of shredded chicken in my stews). If the chicken is fully cooked, it will pull apart quite easily. Put the chicken back into the crock and turn heat to low until ready to serve.\n\nRight before serving, saut\u00e9 the collard greens with a bit of butter and a generous pinch of salt. Use tongs to toss the greens. Saut\u00e9 until slightly wilted and a pretty green.\n\nServe over quinoa, and garnish with wilted collard greens, shredded carrots, and coarsely chopped peanuts.\n\nLove, love, love this recipe!  Many thanks!!",

I generally followed the recipe and used red garnet sweet potatoes as they are chock full of nutrients. We omitted the greens cut the red pepper flakes by half and used chunky natural peanut butter (no sugar added) so I tossed in a small fistful of brown sugar and a little cinnamon ground cloves and cumin for added aromatic spice. I actually liked that the potatoes cooked down and gave the soup a comforting thick texture perfect on a cold day.

Well on this particular day one of the chefs just had HIS best friend from Senegal over who made this dish for him so he was trying it out on the patrons. We were the first tasters!INSTANT LOVE! I felt it wasn't decent to ask a chef for a recipe to something so as usual I came here! So far so good! In the finishing stages of cooking it now. Did a taste test almost identical to the one I tasted from the vegan restaurant:D! Definitely a keeper! The only things I needed to change (And thus the reason for 4 and not 5 stars) was I did find that 5 cups of chicken stock is quite a bit especially when you then add the juice from the diced tomatoes. So you may want to use 3-4 cups of stock and none of the juice from the diced tomatoes. OH! And I ended up adding a cup of creamy Peanut butter in addition to the crunchy for more peanut buttery taste and not SO many nuts (Although I think that is more Brand specific than recipe specific). All in all I DEFINITELY think you should give this a try!",
