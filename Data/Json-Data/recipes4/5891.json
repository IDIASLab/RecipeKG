I didn't rinse them as instructed. I I felt like that would make them wet again. I hand grated the parmesan and used nutritional yeast instead of ground almonds -not quite a half cup. My oven had been on a long time so it was nice and toasty. These came out perfectly! A delicious low carb craving satisfier!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was good but wasn't quite what I expected. In my opinion the herbs were too much I am going to cut down on them by 25% or so next time. Or maybe even use fresh herbs instead of dried. It's possible I did something wrong as I did bake about 5 minutes longer than specified here (my oven is weak and often takes longer) but all the herbs came out very bitter tasting. If you are a family who has always raised your children on health food options like these (assuming you don't mess the herb taste up like I did) your kids will probably like these just fine. This is not however a recipe to offer children who are being slowly moved into healthier eating. It clearly tastes like something meant to be healthy. I thought the breading came out crispy enough I actually enjoyed the texture. Someone commented that the breading sticks to itself better than the zucchini and my comments to that would be 1) make sure your zucchini is drained well enough and 2) makes sure you give the egg a moment to drip off before dipping into breading. It sticks to itself because it becomes too infiltrated by the egg. I had this problem near the end when the constant dipping had transferred quite a bit of egg into the breading bowl. Overall I personally liked it but I will use fresh herbs next time if they are available to me or cut down on the dry. I will also add a little more parmesan and slice a little thinner to get a more thoroughly crisped outcome.",
