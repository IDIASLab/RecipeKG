Then I take roasted minced garlic and spread it out all over the corn (not too much, about a 1/2 tsp or so, I guess) and then I add some salt and pepper, wrap it up tight and grill it. It's AWESOME!

I peeled the husks back a bit to remove a little of the silk put it back then left them soak in cold water for 30 minutes. I put the corn in husks on the grill for 30 minutes rotating it around the coals. The corn cooks by steaming inside the husks. I made my own garlic butter for these and all that was left to do was sprinkle with a bit of salt.",
