This popcorn is delicately coated in the cinnamon confection and is a breeze to make. I agree with RMSR the butter can be cut. I've experimented and think that 1/2 cup butter is best with about 1/4 cup more cinnamon candies. Enjoy!!!",

The other reviewer said she had problems with the length of time baking in the oven along with the pocorn being chewy I belive that is because she used honey and not the corn syrup. But I do agree that the butter can be cut down to 1/4 cup I found that to be enough for the coating. I also sugest that you keep the popcorn warm in the oven until you are ready to pour on the candy this will help it to coat more even when you stir it in.",

I thought the flavour of the candies came through well enough this way. I did bake them longer than 30 minutes (closer to an hour) but they're still quite sticky (set but not completely- was afraid to burn them if left longer). There was still an excess amount of the coating after the baking stage which left the popcorn chewy not crunchy. I would use more popcorn next time and maybe a little less butter as they were greasy.",

I used Hot Tamales which look more like a gel capsule for vitamins! They didn't quite melt well and that is exactly what they loved about this! I made only half a batch and it took a whole tray lined with parchment for the baking part. I did pop my own corn using nearly 4 tablespoons of kernals for the batch. Now I have an order to make this again very soon. I started something here! Or should I say that CLField did! Thank you!",

I also didn't bother with the parchment paper or the bowl. I put all the popcorn in a prepared roasting pan which I kept in the oven as another reviewer suggested and then poured the boiling candy over it. I mixed it up before putting it in the oven and about four times while it was in the oven. Thanks for the yummy (and easy) recipe!!",
