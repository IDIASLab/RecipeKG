I put 5 sprigs of fresh thyme instead of the 1 recommended and still thought it was bland. Next time I will add a lot more and maybe some other spices. Or perhaps an additional Tbsp of dried thyme. The meat came out very tender and delicious. I will make this again but with more spices and probably in the winter. Thanks Camping Girl!",
