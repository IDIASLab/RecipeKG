I just add the mushroom soup to the saucepan and mix the cheese in with the noodles before pouring the sauce over the top of the noodles. I do save some cheese for the top too. It usually tastes better the second day for that reason but I am a working mom and if I spend 2 1/2 hours cooking dinner we won't eat until 7 or 8.",

I omitted the cheese only because I didn't have it on hand. It turned out terrific and the two men in my house said it was the best spaghetti they ever tasted.
