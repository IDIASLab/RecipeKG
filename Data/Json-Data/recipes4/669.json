I had a can of jumbo buttermilk biscuits and also a can jumbo flaky biscuits (8 per can).  There was so much filling that I ended up using both cans.  I just rolled out a small pizza-sized round about six inches per biscuit, put filling on, folded and crimped them and baked them in the oven for about 15 min., when the tops started to get golden brown.  Talk about easy to work with and cooks in half-the-time!  Both biscuit doughs were good, but the vote tended toward using the flaky biscuit dough.",

My German grandmother used to make these as well and no one ever thought to write it down so it was lost. My only tip is to make sure you drain the meat mixture very well and that you salt and pepper generously (I omitted the lemon pepper and used black pepper instead). Definitely brush with butter.

The dough turned out amazing. Soft and delicous! He used a chuck steak that he braised with the rest of the spices from the ingredients. Braised it for a few hours. The dough after it was made stayed in the fridge all night. The next day he added the meat after it was shredded to about a cup to a cup and a half of saurkraut and used that as the filling. Was very good. So we changed it quite a bit but was very good. Just to give you some ideas of what you can do with this recipe. Thanks.",
