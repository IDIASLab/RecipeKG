I LOVE it with the basil. To avoid a \"hay\" taste be sure to fry the basil to BRIGHT GREEN and NOT DARK GREEN or Black! I'm updating because I have made this several times now and tonight the grocery store did not have any fresh basil. I bought a bag of prewashed baby spinach and fried it instead and then added 2 teaspoons of dried basil to the sauce as I was cooking it. It was just as good and the baby spinach is about half the price or less than the basil. Also definately don't try making this with anything but real grape tomatoes. Their sweet unique flavor is what really does it for this dish. AND COOKING WINE! My store was out of cooking wine and I tried using a medium dry white and YUCK!!!",

I used chicken thighs instead of breasts (we prefer dark meat)and followed the recipe exact. The chicken was super tender and full of flavor! As others said, the only problem is this doesn't call for enough rice. Double the rice to 2 cups, serve with some fresh steamed broccoli and you've got yourself an incredible meal!! This is a must try!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe Amanda!! :)",

I wasn't sure whether or not to keep the skin on the chicken so I took the healthier option and removed it. I was making 2 servings but I used a whole can of low sodium fat-free chicky broth and simmered the breasts in it turning them every 5 mins or so. I omitted the wine because I only had cheap plonk and I know from experience that that sort of crappola adds nothing good to a dish. Great recipe. Thanks!",

I would suggest using more rice as one cup didn t make enough for everyone. I excluded the tomatoes because I didn t have any on hand and didn t miss them at all. The fried Basil made for a grand presentation. Rave reviews from everyone. Thanks for sharing your recipe Amanda. I ll definitely be making this one again!",
