For the dough I only used 4 cups of flour.  I divided the dough into thirds and rolled it out with a rolling pin.  I sliced the rolled 1/3 portions with a pizza cutter in half the long way.  This resulted in 6 potato filled logs.  I sliced the logs into 1 1/4 inch pieces with dental floss and brushed them with an egg wash (1 beaten egg yolk + 1 tbs milk).  I baked them at 375F for 45 minutes.  Makes 60 small knishes.  I brought them to work and had one of the girls I work with (who is a self-proclaimed \"expert knish eater\") try one.  She said the filling was right but the crust was wrong.  She said it should be flaky, like a pie crust.  Next time I'll use a pastry crust recipe for the dough.  YUM!!",
