When I was living there, my roommates and I would wait all week for Couscous Friday, so naturally when I returned to the States, I had major withdrawals from it. The traditional preparation is very time consuming and requires special equipment, so I adapted the recipe that I learned in the village to be made at home. I think Norah would be proud!",
