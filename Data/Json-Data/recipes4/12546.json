First, I made exactly as written with the exception of not adding the pasta, and found the sauce totally without flavor, flat.  We simply would not have eaten it the way it tasted, just bland.  So I added more pickled jalape\u00f1o, more red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, chopped fresh oregano and basil, added some small cut-up sweet fresh tomatoes, along with some red bell pepper, and just let it cook down, allowing the flavor to develop. I cooked the pasta separately because I\u2019d already reduced the sauce, added it to the sauce along with some saut\u00e9ed shrimp, and will say the lime at the end was this recipe\u2019s salvation for us.  This recipe has had decent reviews, and I wouldn\u2019t discourage others from trying it, but it just didn\u2019t work for us.  I giving it 4 stars, but that\u2019s based on the changes that I made.",
