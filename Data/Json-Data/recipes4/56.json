Before marinating the chicken I make sure to poke holes in it with a fork to let the marinate soak in, as another reviewer suggested.  I use a zesty Italian dressing and usually throw it together before leaving for work, 9 hours later it has a great flavor and makes a quick meal.  To give it an extra kick, before cooking I usually take a few pieces and dip each side in a bowl of parmasean cheese.  I'm not a fan of the extra cheesy taste but everyone else loves it that way!!  Cook this with the Oven Roasted Potatoes recipe from this site and you have an easy and delicious meal that people will love!!",

I use a 2 1/2 lb. bag of boneless skinless chicken breasts and use enough Kraft Fat Free Caesar Italian to marinate. As someone recommended mushrooms I gave it a try tonight and they were scrumptious! I halved or quartered the big mushrooms and marinated them overnight with the chicken. I cook it in a foil lined 13x9 pan that's also covered with foil for 30 minutes at 375 degrees, remove foil and bake another 10-15 minutes. Since the color is so pale I sometimes sprinkle with paprika. The leftovers are great for all sorts of things like in salads and wraps etc.",

I always bake my chicken while it is still in the marinade, it makes it MUCH more juicy and flavorful..and I usually spoon some of the marinade over the chicken when I serve it. The family loves it that way. Baking it without the marinade made it very dry. You should definitely bake it with the marinade!!!",
