                "reviewBody": "There is nothing wrong with this recipe at all with the exception of how to account for the wide variation of breast thickness/weight a consumer may receive from their grocery. The broiler is a radiant heat source so the amount of time it takes to penetrate a material is very dependent on thickness. The thawed split breasts I used were obviously thicker than the author's and after the ~20 minutes in the broiler the internal temp was only 124 degrees. A continuation of broiling would leave the exterior burnt. It would seem that broiler recipes have an built in requirement for some consideration for thickness and weight. As a suggestion it might be handy for the original recipe to indicate what the thickness and weight was so those reading it could try to adjust.",

These were incredibly flavorful and so juicy and tender you'd think they  had been brined.  Rather than individual seasonings I used my favorite Tuscan seasoning blend, but I don't think you could go wrong seasoning these any way you like.  As I've found (unfortunately) so often is the case, chickens are bred to be much  bigger than they used to be, and that means larger breast portions too.  That said, even tho' the breasts I used were huge,  I found 40-45 minutes in the oven was just right, so watch cooking time carefully!  We sliced these up and drizzled the pan juices over them upon serving.  I served this with Golden Potato and Herb Bake, also from this site, and fresh steamed broccoli.  It was a beautiful, light, and satisfying dinner.",
