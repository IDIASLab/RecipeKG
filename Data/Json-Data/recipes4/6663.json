I find that it's not even necessary to roll out the dough, I can just pat it into shape and cut.  I like to pat into a circle and cut wedges, so they look a bit like scones, but any shape works.  I like these made with whole wheat flour, and I find they rise just fine with less baking powder (I can use 1 1/2 tablespoons for a double recipe).  I can also reduce the salt and thus the sodium.  True, these biscuits are more dense than ones made with butter, but these are healthier and easier to fix!  Thanks!",
