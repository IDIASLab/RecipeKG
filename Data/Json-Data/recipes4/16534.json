I didn't use any butter while sauting, merely a tablespoon of olive oil. Once the garlic and onions were translucent, I added 1 lb. lean ground beef, seasoned it with about 2 tsps. garlic powder, 2 tsps. onion powder, 1 tsp. season salt, and eyeballed some freshly ground black pepper. Once the meat was cooked thoroughly, I added 4 tsps. dried basil & 2 tsps. dried oregano (a tip to get the flavor of dried spices to heighten, rub the dried spices in your dry hands before placing in the recipe, it releases the oils in the herbs) as well as one-fourth tsp. crushed red pepper (for some heat). I reduced the heat and let this simmer for about 5 minutes.\n\nThen I added 2-14.5 oz. cans of tomatoes, including the juices  (I LOVE tomatoes and chose 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes & 1 can petite diced tomatoes), as well as one-half can tomato paste (to add some body to the sauce as recommended by another reviewer). I let this simmer for about 10 minutes.\n\nNext I used a fork to pull the squash away from the skin. I then added the squash to the sauce mixture and stirred well to incorporate the squash well with the sauce. I then let it simmer for about 10 minutes.\n\nThis yielded quite a bit and I froze half of it once it cooled, the other half was demolished immediately!",

I used shredded Parmesan Romano and Asiago instead of grated Parmesan. I only needed half a spaghetti squash because I wanted the sauce to DOMINATE the dish (covered and refrigerated the rest for another day). Turned out very good--served with chicken Parmesan from this food site. A very satisfying meal without all the pasta!",

It makes a lot of spaghetti which I was not prepared for but seems to keep for a couple days pretty well. The squash was a little crunchy for my taste so I definietly recommend cooking it the full 45 min and not 30 min like many other recipes say. I will definelty be making this again soon!
