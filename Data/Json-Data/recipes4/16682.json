                "reviewBody": "We loved this. I substituted fresh parsley for the cilantro because my wife is one of those people that tastes soap when she has cilantro. I also substituted regular paprika a pinch of light brown sugar for sweet paprikia because I did not have any sweet paprika. Finally I left out all of the cayenne pepper for the first batch because my wife does not like things that are too spicy. I will probably add back 1/2 of it (1/8th tsp) in the next batch. My batch was also done 15 minutes early so if you don't want mushy peas start checking about 30 minutes early to see if it is done. I DO have one question. I was raised in South Carolina and we raised 3 different types of peas that would match the description you use. They all grew in pods that were about 4-6 inches long. Blackeye peas are the smallest in crosswise diameter and are sold dried under that name in stores. They have a small black spot where the pea attaches to the pod. Purple hull peas were larger in diameter and had no black spot that I remember. What we called cow peas (or crowder peas) were the biggest in diameter (almost garbanzo bean sized) and I think they too had no black spot. My Dad said they were called cow peas because sometimes they were used (whole with th pod) as food for the cows So which of these do you use? I used the dry blackeye peas from the store and they were really good.",

I don't know why you would dump a bunch of cold oil and raw onions in a pot with everything instead of actually sauteing them.\n\nI sauteed the onions and garlic and then added tomato paste and sauteed that for a bit. Then I added everything in together. Using broth instead of water is good for extra flavor. Just go easy on the salt if you do that.\n\nOne reviewer suggested using brown sugar if you don't have sweet paprika. I used smoked paprika and about a teaspoon of brown sugar.\n\nAfter fixing the recipe it turned out great. Definitely five stars. I just can't give this recipe five stars as written because of the whole cold-oil-and-raw-onions thing.",
