Unless you choose to use this dressing that is. Use a high quality aged balsamic for this salad for best results and the freshest figs you can find. I brought ours back from Seattle WA and they were better today one week later than those I recently purchased here in Wisconsin (they molded the very next day). Oh what a salad. Five stars - from both of us.",

Figs can be hard to find but when you do be sure to try this recipe! I used a bit more arugula than called for so the portions would be a bit bigger given the number of figs. I recommend whisking the honey and balsamic together in a small bowl before drizzling over the arugula. A light sprinkle of salt and freshly cracked pepper in the dressing would be a nice touch.
