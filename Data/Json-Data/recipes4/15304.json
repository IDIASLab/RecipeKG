I changed the flour combo as I don't keep amaranth around.  So I used a combo of sorgum, buckwheat, brown rice, potato starch and coconut flour.  I subbed the agave syrup for honey straight across.  \n\nNot sure why the baking soda was in such a high measurement and wonder if it would have been better to decrease this and add some baking powder, but it did rise a little (mostly around the outside edges).  \n\nVery happy to have stumbled upon this recipe as I have wanted gingerbread for a couple years now :)  I will definitely make it again, but probably keep the buckwheat measurements the same in my next batch.  I am guessing it adds a bit to the overall product.  \n\nIt tastes best cooled completely in my opinion.",

I had to make some flour substitutions: a homemade brown rice and sorghum blend instead of amaranth then chestnut flour instead of coconut flour each in equal parts. The consistency was perfect dense and moist holding up to being handled. I even made gingerbread men cutouts and they stood up to all the work. I used flax seeds instead of eggs as written and couldn't tell any difference from a cake made with egg. The flavour is not to be beat. It has a zing to it that grabs you and says make a tea now. However the overall taste is mellow and screams Autumn. I agree with the other reviewer that a glaze on top would be nice. All-in-all a keeper recipe for anyone vegan or not celiac or not. It's simply a wonderful cake don't pass it up.",
