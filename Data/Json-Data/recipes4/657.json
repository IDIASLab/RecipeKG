The flavor was great but I had a big problem getting it to unpeel from my pan despite heavy oiling and once I did it didn't really work when attached to a bowl. I think next time I'll bend it over a small drinking glass my bowls were too big. Any ideas for how to make it not stick so bad? When it set up it was too rigid I couldn't get it to separate from my bowl without breaking.",
