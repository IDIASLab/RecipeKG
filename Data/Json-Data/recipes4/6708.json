Since oregano can have a strong taste, I'd caution you to perhaps start with going a little short on that herb--you can always add, but it's harder to take away!  Cooking time could vary depending on how dry your bread is to start with.  I took mine out of the oven when they were nicely golden brown, but they weren't quite crunchy yet.  I baked them a little more, and they almost got too done.  I liked the process of how to toss the bread cubes in the butter solution.  Thanks for adding so much flavor to our salad!",
