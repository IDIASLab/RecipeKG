Left beans and seasonings the same except for using a couple garlic cloves instead of powder. The tomato part just seemd like too much (plus didn't have a pot big enough). So used 1 jar of chile sauce the can of puree and only one can of diced (fire roasted mmm). Came out thick and hearty. If you wanted it thinner by all means add the recommended chile and diced tomatos. Also added some heat with red pepper flakes. Man this is one awesome pot of chili. Would be perfect for a crowd.",

We used 2/3 of the recommended amount of TVP and it was plenty thick. MSG is quite common in TVP so make sure you choose a brand that does not have MSG! Instead add some extra salt and hotsauce and a good couple tbsps of barbecue sauce to the chili. It makes things super tasty and free of questionable chemicals! Thanks!",
