I used crushed tomatoes liquid smoke minced garlic and several Mrs. Dash blends to taste (Steak Grill Garlic Table blend) and Old Bay seasoning. The mackerel I used was plain and not tomato. I make another similar dish with kale or collard greens and tilapia fish. I like to serve with gumbo vegetables and tomatoes with balsamic vinegar and hot sauce. GREAT! I hadn't had mackerel in decades and it's better than sardines but not as good as red salmon to me. My husband liked it better than I did. The canned fish definitely takes away from the dish. I would make it again because it's FAST and my husband really liked it.:)",

One note for those like me who need to learn things the hard way: Drain the mackerel before adding it to the tomato sauce pan. If you don t the taste of fish is strong. Also this full head of cabbage meal makes a full pot of soup. Next time I may try half the cabbage because my family is small. I also added cracked black pepper a chopped carrot and a chopped celery stalk.",
