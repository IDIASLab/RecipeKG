I used only 1 oz. of candies and only 1/2 c. of unsweetened applesauce to cut down on the sweetness. I also didn't have any lemon so I substituted peach. It was so good that my kids fought over it! The next day I tried it with the lemon and it wasn't too good. In fact it was a weird combination so stick with the peach flavor!",

I have done it with cherry jello but the lemon jello is used to give it a bit of punch to cover the sweetness of the candies. Not for everyone but a nice change of pace for those who want something different for their next gathering. Serve with casseroles that have cream sauces or with ham dinners.",

I love red hot candies Jell-O and applesauce but everyone that tried it in my house was perplexed on what to make of it. For one it was extremely cinnamon-y sweet it sat in the fridge for over 4 hours and held a shape for like 5 minutes and started turning into gelatin-y sauce. Was not impressed about it flattening while trying to take photos of it and I went so far as to put it in pretty mini molds for it's appearance but by the time I walked with it out of my kitchen and into my office where I have my photo box it was almost pouring off the plate. Then just turned right around went back to the kitchen put it in a bowl and called it done. Then emptied all the other mold together into a bigger bowl and back into the fridge. If it wasn't so overwhelmingly sweet and held it's shape I might enjoy it better. Sorry my apologies.",
