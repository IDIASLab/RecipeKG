It was a winner and I made several batches becuse it became a regular request for the rest of the cookouts during tht e summer of 2010.  I was looking for this again so I can use it today because of the beautiful weather here in Florida.  Wonderful flavor and great reason to get together with friends and family.\n\nI use the recipe basically as is except for the marinating time.  I always get shrimp when it is on sale.  I purchase at least 10 lbs in two pound portions.  When I get home I make the marinade x5 and place each portion of marinade in gallon zip lock freezer bags.  I place the shrimp in the marinade and freeze making sure they are laying flat so they freeze into a flat sheet of goodness.  When I know I will be needing one of these, I place it in the refrigerator to thaw.  During the thawing process they merinade and I cut down on my prep time because I already did this ahead of time.  Happy cooking and thanks for this delicious recipe.",

I had a bag of frozen shrimp and some chipotles that I had leftover and frozen from a previous recipe. This was easy to do and so tasty. Didn't change the recipe at all except for adding some extra chipotles because I didn't want to refreeze them. We chopped up the shrimp to use in tacos. I threw some more cilantro on top with chopped red onions then gave them a squeeze of lime juice- YUM! My husband loved this meal and asked for it again already. I'll have to cut back on the chipotles to make it kid friendly but this one is a winner. Thanks for sharing.",

UPDATE: after a bit of tweaking this turned into a 5 star dish.. i used the zest and juice of 4 small lemons upped the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to 3 used 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro doubled the kosher salt added about 1 tsp of cumin and left out the dried peppers and paprika.. cooked this on a our gas grill using our island grill stone.. this would totally work on chicken or pork as well.. glad i gave this another try",
