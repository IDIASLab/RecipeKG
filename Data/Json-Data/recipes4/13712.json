I didn't have a red pepper, but I had to make this, so I used a few dashes of hot sauce and cayenne. This is the only kale soup recipe on this site that I found with wine in it. It makes a big difference. Otherwise, it's much closer to chicken soup. First thing, before sauteeing the onion, I crisped up some canadian bacon to add flavor. For the kale, I used one bunch, chiffonaded/julienned very thin and let the whole pot set overnight. The soup was transformed. I highly recommend it! Thanks for the recipe.",

But I'm giving it 4 stars because the recipe timing should be flipped -- the kale needs to cook longer than 20 min and should be put in before the potatoes and beans or they become mushy and overcooked. (I used canned beans.) Just flip the last two instructions and make a great hearty soup. I also added a little parmesan cheese to each bowl before serving and also added beef kelbasa (sp?) when I added the beans and potatoes. Delicious!",

Other than doubling the recipe, I omitted the chile pepper (since this is for a 2 yr old too), added a little sausage, and some sea salt, since I used homemade unsalted chicken broth. I reserved half of the garlic and added at the very end, to get the most of its amazing health properties.  I used Pinot Grigio wine (I keep the mini 4-pks around for cooking) and it gives the soup a new dimension. Oh, and I put about 75% of the soup in a blender, and then mixed them together to give this a creamy bean-potato base. Nummy!",

I had parsnips (yum!) instead of carrots so I added a can of tomatoes for the color. And because tomatoes make everything tasty. Subbed a bay leaf because my sage plant died.:( Didn't have chicken broth so instead I used water with a couple tablespoons of soy sauce and a dash of Worcestershire. Kept the wine in and I'm so glad - it added a nice depth and sharpness to the soup. This cooked up quickly and was a beautiful and delicious soup for a chilly rainy winter evening. Nice and forgiving recipe - one to keep and play around with depending on what's in your fridge.",
