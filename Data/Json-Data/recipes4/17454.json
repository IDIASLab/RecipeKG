I like to add a bit of tumeric to my egg whites for color and for a bit of flavor. To ensure that the potatoes were cooked well I chopped them in cubes and cooked them for about 10 minutes with olive oil before adding the greens. Potato slices would need the same extra cooking. I don't think they would cook completely otherwise. Served this for brunch with pancakes and then leftovers with a salad for lunch the next day. Delicious!",
