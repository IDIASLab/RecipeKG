I've been eyeing this recipe for a while and am glad I finally got around to trying it but I do wish the end product tuned out differently. Don't get me wrong... these were good just not GREAT. For one there are WAAAY WAAAY too many chocolate chips in the batter. Every bite (I HAD to try one before sending my bf to work with the rest!) was overwhelmingly chocolaty - and that's not a good thing in this instance IMHO. I also must agree with fellow reviewer Trcia Jaeger. The \"extra\" ingredients are a waste if for none other than contributing to the cake's incredibly moist texture (which is a plus). All in all this is a nice basic butter cake recipe but I do believe it is IMPERATIVE to decrease the amount of chocolate chips by at least a cup!!! Thanks for sharing your idea Bobbie:)",
