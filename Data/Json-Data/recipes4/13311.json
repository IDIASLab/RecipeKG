If you do what the recipe says and do the pomegranate sauce yourself it is a lot of work for a little bit of flavor. Secondly I'm not sure if i liked the choice of cut for the pork. Yes it was VERY tender but it for me personally id prefer something boneless and with less fat. Would I make this in the future? yes probably. But i would probably use boneless pork loin and use pomegranate juice instead.",
