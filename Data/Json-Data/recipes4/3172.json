                "reviewBody": "I've prepared this recipe a number of times, and I've made some changes that we think improved it.  First, I omit the sweet potato (we don't like them). I add one chopped apple for each person (instead of one apple/two persons).  I use baby carrots and cook them on the stove until they're about halfway cooked through, then drain them and toss them with the chopped apples.  I omit the onion because it upsets our stomachs, but I season the apples and carrots with onion powder and pepper.  A few times, I've added small red potatoes that I've quartered (depending on size) and tossed with the seasoned apples and carrots, but the last time I made this I baked potatoes (not sweet potatoes) to serve alongside.  One thing I do now that I think is crucial to making this dish moist is to add some apple juice approximately halfway through baking. I pour it into the apple/carrot/potato (if using) mix in the bottom of the pan and stir it around. I check it again about 10 minutes later and add more juice, if needed. This keeps everything from drying out.  I also use dried cranberries instead of fresh, and the apple juice helps a lot with 'plumping' them.  All in all, both my husband and I really enjoy this dish in the winter.  It's easy to prepare and compared to many other recipes, fairly healthy.",

                "reviewBody": "I chose this recipe because I was looking for something tasty that my family would enjoy that had a \"red\" theme for Valentine's Day. My wife & I have 4 daughters that have grown up and their taste pallets have matured but they are not big red meat fans. Chicken fit the bill. I used whole chicken breasts instead of halves. After reading several other reviews, I noticed many concerns about the cranberries and general dryness of the dish so I used the canned whole cranberries which would increase the moisture content. also Besides just brushing the breasts with bbq sauce, I used honey BBQ sauce and increased the amount to 1 1/4 cups & poured the remaining sauce over the dish. the result was fabulous. It not only increased the moisture content of the chicken, but it melded nicely with the onions , apples, carrots and sweet potatoes and made a delicious semi-thick sauce that could be spooned over the chicken at serving. Although I love onions, I will decrease the amount to one onion for a yield of six servings next time. Carrots were a bit much as well. I used 8 rather than the 9 that the recipe called for. I will decrease these to six. The sweet potatoes presented enough orange color and flavor for this dish. I needed 2 baking dishes to handle the large chicken breasts. (we love left overs) I served this with long grain and wild rice, a perfect compliment. All in all, this was a very tasty, well received meal and a keeper. I will make this again when we have guests over.",

I ended up needing to cook this for about 55-65 minutes but that was because my chicken was not as thawed as I thought. Also..... I left the apple peels and potato peels on in order for the fiber and I enjoyed this dish just the same I forgot I had done that in fact... So leave the peels on:D Overall VERY tasty very unique recipe that is what I think.",

I think next time I will pour 1/2 C. apple cider over everything befor baking to create more of a juice/sauce.",

I really liked the whole dish the other person did not appreciate the cranberries with her vegetables. I used a lg. sweet potato that I peeled but did not precook and my chicken breasts were added right from the freezer to the recipe. I put the chicken on top of all the vegetables. and covered the casserole dish. Everything was ready in 60-75 minutes and the chicken was not dry because it was cooked covered. I will certainly make this again. Because my sweet potato was quite large and both carrots and sweet potatoes are orange starches the carrots were omitted this time.",
