Somehow my rice took longer to cook than directed and I had to keep adding more coconut milk. You could not taste the five-spice at all; I would perhaps double it. I ate mine without cheese but my husband thought the pepper jack made for a strange combination. We both kept adding salt. I like the idea of this recipe but will not make again.",
