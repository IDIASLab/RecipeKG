No mangoes or avocadoes  in the house, (but I have also never had mangoes or avocadoes in it at Thai homes or restaurants).  So, I used cucumbers and tomatoes, chopped up, and followed the directions for the dressing.  We had a bowl of rice with the salad, which was quite filling.  I used thin slices of top sirloin for the meet and marinated it for a couple of hours in  a little oil, lemon juice, and dried basil.  Fixed the meat on the grill..3 minutes to a side..brought it in, let it sit a few minutes, then sliced it into strips.  The dressing is perfect and the flavor was what I was used to eating.  One day when I have a mango I will try it with a mango.    It is easy and the cooking time is quite short, as you need to watch the meat so it doesn't get tough and overcooked.  I have it a 4 because of the mango and avocado...s.  Still not sure about avocado, and I am an avocado fanatic..used to have an avocado tree in our yard in the Valley of Texas.",

I would prefer less meat and more salad, and would try it next time with grilled chicken in place of the beef.  As a meal, I think it needs quite a bit more salad and/or less meat and fewer servings.  It was probably closer to two servings as written; however, that would make there way too much meat and mango.  We don't enjoy  bell peppers, so those were left out.  It was fine without the peppers.",
