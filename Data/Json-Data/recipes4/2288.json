I generally stick it in the oven, then make potato wedges or my squash (sauteed yellow squash and zucchini) while it's baking. I began using sage on salmon during my college years, when I grew entirely too much of the herb, and put it in pretty much everything. It became my favorite herb, and lends a delicate and unexpected taste and scent to this dish. I tend to cook the salmon in the oven during the winter, but grilling works nicely as well, especially charcoal grills.",

I realized I was out of sage so I just used what I had:  thyme, paprika, and lemon pepper. I had cayenne but omitted due to the little ones. Then I added garlic, some ginger and a bit of dill.  Cooked the salmon with virgin olive oil in a skillet and towards the end of the process I threw in some sherry and put a lid on and simmered for about 5-10 minutes.  I did not add any salt.\n\nResults: My 3 year old had thirds, and my 5 year old had seconds. \n\n",

I left out the cayenne pepper(hubby can't eat spice) and threw in ginger instead.  I know, weird, but it gave it a nice bite.  I didn't wrap the fillets in aluminum foil...I ran out with only enough the cover the top...LOL.  I put them in a glass Pyrex casserole and then covered it with the last of my aluminum.",
