I am so happy I did.  These are wonderful, easy to make and your guests will be coming back for more - that is if you want to serve them to guests - I might be inclined to keep them all for myself.  A good glass of red wine and you have a real treat!\r\n\r\nNote: the restaurant mentioned grills theirs to the point where the bacon becomes blackened on the top. Either way, if you grill or bake them, I suggest doing so on a rack so that they don't sit any grease that comes from the bacon.",

I have to say either way you go any variation is delicious: blue cheese ricotta gorgonzola adding brown sugar wine reduction and almonds. BUT...I think my favorite is the bacon rolled in brown sugar stuffed with smoked almonds and blue cheese with a wine reduction. It is much tastier with the brown sugar believe me! I think my second favoriate was the dates stuffed with ricotta. But regardless of the cheese you use - you can't go wrong I would definitely add almonds to the mix as the crunch is very nice.

I did a test-run before the party... my guess is they'll be gorgeous with a champagne cocktail or a nice white wine (even a Chardonnay might be good). I tried some with Old Amsterdam cheese (like Gouda) and some with almonds - both turned out great! I used Medjool dates which are very plump and rich. Also I found that there was no real need to use a toothpick - the bacon stayed wrapped by itself. Lastly I baked them on a broil pan so the bacon grease had a place to drip into. I can't wait to serve these to my guests!:)",

I used feta and slivered almonds and they fit perfectly in the dates.\n\nThe cooking and the directions worked great.  The cheese stayed put and the dates were delicious.\n\nI used skewers and put 5-6 dates on one skewer to save toothpicks and the amount of time I had to flip each date.  I just had to flip the skewers and it was easy to pop the dates off and put them in a dish.\n\nPutting them on a skewer also helped keep the bacon stay put.  \n\nSo tasty!  Thanks for sharing!",
