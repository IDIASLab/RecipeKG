Well my cake didn't fall apart. It held very well. Nice form. Except for the missing top!!!! I don't think I'd use the topping again. It all sank to the bottom of the pan (top of the cake). Maybe you have to use the tiniest amount of topping. But then what's the point? I'm wondering if maybe cutting the carmels into tiny pieces and laying them on top of the batter before you put it in the oven. Or not add any carmel to the cake mix and just use carmel frosting instead of chocolate frosting because you're adding chocolate pudding to the frosting anyways. I LOVE the frosting and I am not a frosting person. But I'm going to try carmel frosting instead next time.",

I think caramel topping would make it too wet unless you took out some of the water from the cake. The part that did not stick to the pan did not get hard and just added flavor to the cake.
