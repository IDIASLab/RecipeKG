I use 1/2 cup flax seed (the miracle grain as I call it) and omit the wheat germ and sunflower seeds. I use 1/2 cup sliced almonds and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. I also add 1 tsp. vanilla extract. I love the nutmeg and cinnamon - it smells so good baking! For cost reasons I only use raisins and dried cranberries for the fruit. I end up baking mine for almost 40 minutes until it is toasted and crunchy. It clumps up very nicely. Hint: stir the oil and honey together first before adding to oat mixture.",

I combined all the dry ingredients (except for the dry fruit and placed it in the oven for about 20 minutes to toast them up. I combined the oil and honey in a saucepan with the cinnamon and a pinch of salt and brought it to a boil. This thinned out the honey and made it easier to pour over all the dry ingredients. I added the dried fruit 1/2 way thru the baking so they would not burn. I needed to bake the granola for much much longer than suggested. But it was very good.",

I then waited to add the oatmeal until last after mixing the other ingred. with honey/oil mix. Instead of wheat germ I used an extra 1/4 cup flax seed and didn't add sunflower seeds. For fruit we used raisins and craisins. We baked about 25-30 min. until we started to smell it then I took it out because I didn't want it to burn. Ours didn't break into pieces. update We made this again and liked it much better the second time for some reason. I let it cool and sit overnight and I think the key may be to let it cool COMPLETELY (I realized I didn't do that the first time) because then it did actually break a little more into pieces.
