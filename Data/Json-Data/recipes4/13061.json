I used fresh carrots and frozen veg instead of canned (better texture and WAY less sodium).  I didn't peel the potatoes either.  No need.  I added some fresh basil and dried oregano and let it simmer for a little longer so the carrots would be tender.  Next time I might cook the carrots with the beef to carmelize them (AWESOME flavour enhancer).  I served the soup with a grating of mozzarella on top and thick slices of russian rye bread.  Very filling!",
