I do recommend using fresh sliced white mushrooms instead of canned...Also NO MSG needed!! But most important to kick it up a notch is to add about 2 or 3 tablespoons of A-1 Steak Sauce to the mushroom mixture. This is a very rich & savory mushroom sauce! You won't be disappointed!!",

I did think that the hamburger seasonings made them have the same flavor of what I remember the fast food hamburgers tasting. I used 90% lean beef but added a tsp of vegetable oil to the pan so they would fry up. The medium heat suggested worked well I cooked them on 6 on my burner. They were done in the 10 minutes suggested. I couldn't find processed swiss so I went with a thin sliced lite swiss I found at the store. The sauce doesn't taste great on it's own but it works fine on the burger. I doubled the burger seasonings and buns because I thought it was a lot of sauce and there was still some leftover. ty",

After reading other reviews I believe next time I will add brown gravy to the ingredients halving the amount of golden mushroom soup making up the original amount with the gravy. I also added a little garlic powder. Closer yet. With that being said I found this to be the most satisfying burger. Definitely will continue to make & fiddle with the ingredients until it is in my opinion exactly a Hardee Mushroom Swiss.",

I used fresh mushrooms and natural swiss instead of the jarred mushrooms and processed swiss just because I like them better. I omitted the MSG because I never make anything else that calls for it and didn't want to buy it just for this. I agree with the reviewer who said the mushroom sauce doesn't taste very good on it's own but tastes good with the burger. I thought the seasoning (minus MSG) and cook time on the burger was spot on. Very juicy with a good flavor. Will make again but will probably try and find a way to jazz up or replace the mushroom soup so it tastes a bit better on it's own.",
