I add diced tomatoes to mine before serving (after blending of course).  I leave out the water and add a little more lime juice and a dash of vinegar to give it a little extra zing.  You could add jalapenos or hot sauce, but since I'm the only one in my home who likes things spicy, I leave mine pretty mild.",
