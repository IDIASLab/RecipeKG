I often use smoked Gouda cheese, Havarti cheese, and I bet Swiss cheese would be good, too. The vegetable can be easily switched to any vegetable you like (string beans, broccoli, or mixed veggies). I would use fresh or frozen rather than canned if you can.",

It was just OK for us however and maybe it was because I made my own soup (Mushroom Soup I) from this site. The cheese I used was Colby jack. My potatoes never did brown even though they were mostly thawed when I put this dish in the oven. The problem for us was that it was lacking in taste so something I did wasn't quite up to par---maybe a mistake on my part along the way. I will repurpose this recipe into an egg dish and I think that will be a good way to handle the leftovers. I love all the ingredients of this recipe and did so want it to work! Thanks Gentlewoman! Maybe someone else can point out where I went wrong!",
