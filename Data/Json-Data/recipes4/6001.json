Since there were no ratings, I was hesitant.  Glad I didn't pass this one by!  I used a rub from herb-rubbed sirloin tip roast from this site.  I let the rub marinate all day.  I used fresh mushrooms of 8 oz sliced button and 8 oz. sliced baby bellas.  It looked like way too much shrooms, but it wasn't!  I also threw in some sweet onion slices then covered with the dry soup and broth.  Roasted about the 90 min., and it was perfect medium rare.  The dry soup became a bit crunchy, which was great.  Served it with Hasselback potatoes also from this site, and steamed broccoli.  I give it 5 stars, and glad to be the first to rate it.  Give it a try",

However I changed it rather drastically. I used a montreal-type seasoning blend with extra thyme and garlic powder coated all over the roast liberally. Then browned hard and fast normal pan high heat. Transferred roast to ceramic casserole. blended pan juices with broth red wine and just a touch of liquid smoke and worcestershire. added to roast baked for 1 hour at 350 for rare-mid-rare center. poured juices from pan back to skillet. Added half a sliced onion a cup of quartered fresh mushrooms about a tablespoon of whole peppercorns a few thin slices of beef leg bone with marrow a bay leaf garlic powder and fresh thyme. reduced by almost half. meanwhile made a 'scratch roux' which is just some melted butter whisked constantly with regular flour over med heat until it turns from buttery yellow to deep gold (just long enuf to kill the raw flour taste and make sure its whisked super smooth). Add to reduction whisk again to blend gravy slice your roast serve mushroom/onion/peppercorn gravy over top. DELICIOUSNESS. Thank you for the inspiration Jim!",

I wasn't sure whether I should keep the lid on but decided it would be best and it worked out well. Searing took about 5 minutes per side before adding the other ingredients and putting in the oven. I used 3 cans of sliced mushrooms instead of 4 cans of pieces since my roast was a bit less than 3lbs. I cooked mine a bit faster/more than planned (to 155 degrees). One mistake: make sure to mix the corn starch with cool broth - it will clump if you put straight into the hot liquid. As suggested by Gymrat I served this with Hassleback potatoes. I don't usually eat beef OR mushrooms and I enjoyed this. My hubby said and I quote \"Now THIS is a meal!\" He even went for seconds!",
