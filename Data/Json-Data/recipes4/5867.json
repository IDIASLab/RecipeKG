The honey could barely be tasted, and didn't contribute much sweetness, but helped to carmelize the outside. In fact, nothing really stood out above the other components. We didn't discern the Dijon mustard or the garlic, either. Not that this is bad, mind you. I marinated a portobello mushroom cap and tomato slices, grilling them along with the chicken, and this sauce was compatible with those items, as well. The chicken was very juicy, but I attribute that more to the manner of cooking than to a virtue of this particular recipe. Very good. Not exactly rock-your-world-can't-wait-to-have-it-again-five-stars good, but I could see myself possibly making it sometime in the future.",

The chicken breasts I buy are usually already injected with a salt brine, so no need to add more. It's funny to see all the reviews attributing moist chicken to the marinade....raw chicken is moist, even without a marinade. It is overcooking that results in dry chicken. So, use this marinade for a nice, lemony chicken, and make sure not to overcook it if you want it moist :)",
