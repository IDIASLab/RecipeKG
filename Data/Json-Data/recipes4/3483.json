I endd up making another type of Rosemary sauce using the juices from the pan. I couldn't give it a five only because I used the calculator to adjust the serving size and I ended up with too much of the almond mixture for the amount of meat I had. In any case this recipe has great potential for modifications and i'll definitely be trying it again; next time with the yummy sounding apple sauce! I also cut up some zucchini and coated them in bread crumbs and stuffed the tenderloin with it. I rubbed the extra almond mixture inside the pocket before stuffing it. Yummy!",
