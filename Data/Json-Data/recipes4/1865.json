I used bulk sweet Italian sausage, crumbled into smallish almost walnut sized chunks and browned in a bit of olive oil. I did not use vegies to appease the family's different preferences, I used canned sauce spruced up with a bit of Oregano and Basil. I simmered the drained cooked sausage with the sauce on top of the stove for about 30 minutes. I used 2 pounds of sausage and one jar of sauce, I added a bit more sauce when reheating the leftovers the next night. It was even better leftover. I served it on hard rolls then smothered in cheese{provolone and mozz.}I then placed them in a hot oven{450}for about 10 minutes to soften the inside, crisp up the outside and melt the cheese. I gave this recipe 3 stars because it was a great idea, just not a very good method in my opinion.",

I had some \"Best Marinara Sauce Yet\" frozen in a small container so I thawed that and added it vs. using Classico Sauce. I cooked it for 6 hours on low and added the veggies the last hour so they didn't get mushy. When it was done I served it on crusty Italian rolls topped with shredded Parmesan and Romano cheeses - YUM!",
