I have also substituted several dashes of cayenne pepper or our favorite hot sauce instead of using pepper flakes.

I like them better with a small garlic clove added to each jar rather than just cooked in the brine.  I also like to add about 1/2 tsp granulated sugar to each jar, it mellows the flavor without making them sweet.",
