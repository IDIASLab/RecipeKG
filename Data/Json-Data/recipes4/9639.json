I used all 3 cups cheese because we absolutely love cheese. However, it did make it a little more like a dip and less like a soup, so I will only use 2 cups next time as other reviewers suggested. What I LOVE about this recipe is you can literally use whatever veggies and whatever cheese your family likes most.  You can't mess it up!  I used frozen and fresh veggies, but I think next time I will add more.  I will also not simmer for 20 minutes, but only about 10 minutes until crisp tender, as the veggies get even softer when the chowder has to boil again. I look forward to experimenting with this recipe in the future as this will be a regular for us!",

I'm learning to take suggestions through the context of the reviewers own personal preference.  If you like thick soup, as I do--by all means leave the cheese in.  In my opinion, it's not overwhelming and tastes great.  The soup tastes delicious without cheese too, so let common sense lead you to what tastes best to YOU!",

I added a whole red pepper, and a whole chopped onion and a 1/2 head of chopped cabbage because I had it on hand. My secret ingedient in all soups is using a cup of juice rendered from caramelizing 10 sliced onions in the crockpot with one cube of butter for about 18 hours. I strain, and pkg the onions and the juice each in 1 cup baggies, and freeze.  The onions go on meat, and the juice into soups.  With this addition this chowder should go to a 10 star rating!",

At most I suggest serving the soup with cheese sprinkled on top - I also enjoy it with no cheese at all - but there is no need to enrich the soup further by mixing in the cheese ESPECIALLY in the quantity suggested. I love this recipe. It is easy and flexible. Don't be afraid of it if you don't think you like cauliflower which acts to make it \"potato soup-like\". Do what others suggest with chicken broth. Do not overly chop up the brocoli and cauliflower. One can vary the recipe and use up vegetables one has on hand. The next day it thickens and my mom thins it with more broth.",

I sauteed the onion and peppers in a dash of EVOO and 2 healthy spoons of minced garlic then added a carton of chicken broth and the remaining veggies and simmered for about 10 minutes. I added a can of skim evaporated milk w/a dash of flour mixed in. Then I lightly blended some of the soup w/my immersion blender and added about 2/3 a 2 cup bag of 2% shredded cheddar. Good stuff!
