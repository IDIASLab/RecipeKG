The flavor was definitely there, but it was more cakey than I would have liked, I think there was too much batter.  I think next time I make it, I will leave out one egg and half of the flour so the zucchini is really the star.  Also, a tip whenever using zucchini - shred the zucchini and toss it with a bit of salt, then leave in a colander over a bowl in the fridge for 30-60 minutes, when you take it out from the fridge, squeeze the zucchini, and you'll be amazed how much water comes out.",
