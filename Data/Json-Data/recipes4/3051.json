It would have added the perfect amount of heat -- don't hesitate to use it if you like spicier cajun seasoning! I will be using this recipe a lot in the future!

Next time I'd probably cut down on the salt per other reviews, because I don't think I'd miss it and it's healthier. I used the red pepper flakes and thought it was the perfect level of heat.
