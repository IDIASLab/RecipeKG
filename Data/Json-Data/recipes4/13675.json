I cooked the spinach and red pepper along with about 1 teaspoon of minced garlic in 3 tablespoons of butter instead of boiling them in water. I cooked them until the spinach and red pepper were tender then I added the cream cheese milk about 1/2 cup sour cream and about 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. I followed the rest of the recipe as it is written then I transferred the mix to a small crockpot turned on low to keep it warm. Then I thinly sliced a loaf of Italian bread lightly buttered each side and sprinkled mozzerella and parmesan cheeses on it. I baked the bread on a cookie sheet for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees and served the bread with this dip. It made a great appetizer for our party everyone loved it!!!",

Second - We added one clove of fresh garlic (finely chopped). Third - We used roasted red peppers instead of fresh. It added much more flavor to the dip. Fourth - we added some Italian blend cheese into the mixture to make it extra cheesy and to thicken it a bit; we then put a generous sprinkle on top to melt in the oven. For the bread bowl we picked up a round on the discount bakery rack and stuck it in the freezer ahead of time. It didn't matter that it was hard since we were just hollowing it out for the dip. The dip was a big hit!!!",
