First bite in and he was praising it like he has only done a few others from this site. Don't get me wrong he enjoys many from here but this one really stood out to him to the point he was talking about it the rest of the night and already asking when we would have it again. This recipe is great hot or cold and I agree with him in the fact it should be part of our regular rotation. I added green onion to the top because we like it so much and it was good but not necessary. All of the flavors blend splendidly with one another in this and I wouldn't change a thing. Thank you for sharing geranium and congratulations on your Packers;)",

I would suggest that for the amount of dressing I would use a scant cup of orzo or even a little less because it did need a little more dressing. A little garlic in the dressing would have worked well too. Serving it in the pepper was a nice idea but totally not necessary. Actually I might even just dice up a quarter of the pepper and add it to the salad. It just depends on your presentation. I was thinking that adding a quarter cup of toasted pine nuts would have been perfect with this! You can see that this is a versatile idea that will become part of your cooking repertoire. Thanks for posting geranium! UPDATE: I microwaved the little bit of the leftover pasta the next night and it was delicious served warm too!",

When I made the dressing I just added 3/4 tsp Italian seasoning instead of basil & oregano & a dash of lemon juice.
