Rather than use Idaho potatoes, which don't get me wrong I live in ID and love my potatoes, I used yukon gold potatoes about five good sized baseball size ones. I find that these potatoes aren't ase dense and cook a lot quicker than ID potatoes and they really nummy. Secondly I reversed the cooking methods. I cook the potatoes first and then put them on  foil or pan and set them aside I don't even cover them either just let them absorb their residual heat and cook a little more to get them soft. Then I will cook the peppers, onions, chicken, and I add 2 minced cloves of garlic and cook that all up unitl the onions and peppers get tender.  I throw the potatoes back into the party and cook about 5 mins longer and then stir in the sauce and follow the rest of the reciepe.  As my great southern Great grand dad would say \"Wooo Weee that some good cookin!\" I tried it a second time because the chicken I got by accident was a 3 pounder but didn't have another bell pepper so I subsituted a few jalapeno nacho slices and added them into the pan 5 mins before the sauce and it still came out awesome with a little more heat which my husband and I love our heat.  Thanks for a great hash receipe.  Next I will be trying the sister recipe Salmon Hash with potatoes and dill. ",

To the seasoning mixture I added garlic powder paprika and oregano. And when I added the seasoning and chicken mixtures back in with the potatoes I also tossed in a small can of kidney beans. Then I scrambled up some eggs to serve on top. We had it for supper tonight and the best part was that everyone in my large family found something in it to like! We will definitely make it again!",
