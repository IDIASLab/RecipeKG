I used to make it only for brunches but everyone loved it so much I now make it and keep it in the fridge to be heated up in individual servings by anyone needing a quick breakfast. Much better than those toaster things and better for you. It is gone pretty quickly since they eat it after school after work and for dessert. An all around favorite. I have put raisins in it and added nutmeg also apples cut in small pieces. The blueberry sounds good I'll give that a try. Everyone loves this one it is easy and good a real keeper. In reading some reviews that have had mushy results. I don't leave the bread whole I cut it up into bite size pieces. The first time I made it it was a little mushy so I put it into the micro to firm it up. It came out fine I found that if I cut up the bread it got firm quicker I don't like wet french toast either. Hope this helps.",

It puffed up and was nice and golden brown. I only used 1.5 cups of syrup (that's all I had) and it was plenty sweet no one added any to their serving. I also choose not to spread the cream cheese as others had suggested and was glad for one it made it easier to make and second I thought it made it look prettier. I also sprinkled cinnamon on each of the layers. I was worried that it would be soggy as others had complained but mine turned out more what I would call fluffy not soggy. Also as for the portions recipe said it served 8 but with 5 adults and 2 kids we only ate a little less than half. Of course we had other items but I will only make half for the same number of people next time. I will definitely make this again and so will some of the guest I served it to.",
