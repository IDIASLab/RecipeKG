We really watch our salt intake and my husband is allergic to corn which required some modifications to the ingredients. I'm also a little bit lazy. What I changed: - Instead of turkey used 1 lb ground chicken and 1 lb ground sausage. - Only one (large) onion - Used about 36 oz. of reduced sodium chicken broth which is less than what the recipe called for. - Replaced the hominy with a can of Northern beans and instead of 3 cans of white beans unblended I used 2 plus 1 of pinto beans. - Omitted the Cajun and serranos. - Added 7 oz of green chilis about 16 oz of salsa verde and some pinches of chili powder and red pepper flakes. I correctly assumed this wouldn't all fit in my small crock-pot so I did it on the stovetop in a dutch oven for the same amount of time (about 6 hours) stirring every once in awhile and without the lid on for the last hour so it could reduce a bit. Turned out great! Nice flavor not too spicy (I have a tender mouth) but not too bland either (my husband likes things spicier). We served with an irish soda bread which is very cornbread-like without corn and it was a great dinner. Hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we did!",

But well worth the wait!\" I halved the recipe only having a 14.5 oz. can hominy but it was definitely time-consuming to cook and shred the turkey breast and blend the beans/broth/hominy. (I don't have an immersion blender so I just dumped the cans in my regular blender then poured it into the crockpot.) I was a little disappointed that the Cajun seasoning and serrano pepper flavor didn't come thru very strongly but bonus points for that - my spice-averse-yung'in was able to devour her bowl. I think if I make this again I'll wait til I have some leftover chicken or turkey to shred increase the spices and wait to put the cilantro in at serving. (It virtually disappeared into a faint afterthought.) Otherwise a very tasty chili w/ a glob of sour cream green onions and a handful of crushed tortilla chips in the bowl.",
