Maybe I did something wrong but I was hoping for something a little lighter that I could cut open and eat with tuna. These are more like balls of scrambled eggs with matzah meal mixed in. I would recommend making 6 or 8 smaller rolls and baking a little longer. They could use a little seasoning as well; maybe onion or garlic added with the eggs. Sitting in the oven helped crisp up the outsides and they are certainly filling but I will look for another recipe to try next Pesach.",
