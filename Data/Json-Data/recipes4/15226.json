Hence I added 4 tbls of \"finely\" crushed corriander seeds. (A clean coffee grinder works a treat for this opration. A mortar and pestle works just as well but is a time-consumming opera-tion and can cause cramping of your hands.). I be-lieve that the coffe grinder is the easiest and fastest mode to use. I also let them sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours and gave them one final stir before per-manent storage. This allows he flavours to meld. A real gem to present to your guests with your drink of choice whilst the dinner is merrily cooking away in the kitchen. David",
