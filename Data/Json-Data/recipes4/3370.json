I dipped just the top of the chicken breast in egg as that was the only part being dipped in the onions. I also crushed the fried onions to help them better cover the chicken. My chicken breasts were very large so I added extra cheese during the last step. The directions don't state whether to cover while baking. I did not at first but noticed the onions became dark very quickly. I covered the baking dish with foil for about 20 minutes then uncovered to crisp the onions during the last 10 minutes. Because of the size of the chicken breasts my cooking time was also longer.",
