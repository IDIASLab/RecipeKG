Beside that - this is the way I have made this dish for the last 30 years. And - don't forget to serve it with boiled potatoes. All traditional Norwegian recipes, more or less, are served with boiled potatoes.\nFaarikaal - which means sheep in cabbage - is even better the next day. Make a huge pot full, I use a big stock pot - and enjoy this meal for at least two days!",
