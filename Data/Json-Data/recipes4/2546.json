Serve with cocktail pumpernickel and/or rye. I love the tip about drying the onions this can be goopy if you don't drain dry and chill in advance.",

We use that as bait here in Oregon!\"\n\nA few suggestions:  Use a piping bag, or the corner of a plastic zipper bag to add the sour cream/cream cheese topping.  That way, you can leave spaces for people to see what is underneath.  Also, next time, I will use 2 TBS of capers, rinsed, in the egg mixture.  \n\nI placed the onions on a paper towel & put them in the refriegerator, but no juices were given off. Anyway, if I really thought the onions were runny, I'd slice them first, shake salt on them, and then put them in the fridge.  A half hour later I'd take them out and rinse off the salt, pat-dry with paper towels, and then dice the onions.\n\nI garnished the corners with fresh fennel fronds.  It was a lovely touch.",

I think I spent about 12 on the recipe so it wasn't the cheapest thing I could have made but it looked like I spent three times what I did. BTW about the recipe -- drain and rinse BOTH caviars SEPARATELY not just the one. I added capers to the recipe -- just a small jar drained and arranged on top with the caviars.",
