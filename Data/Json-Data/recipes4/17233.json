My husband LOVED it! \nOkay, so my changes were really just additions.  I used  seafood stock, homemade, in place of the water called for, plus carrots, celery, and garlic  when I saut\u00e9ed the onions.  I also added shrimp and scallops and one filet of swai ,which I added to the leftover fish I used to make  a red snapper           earlier in the week.     At the end, I  added some thawed corn.\nI love everything about this recipe.  So fast, so easy, and also adaptable.\nGive this a try because I know you won't be sorry!",
