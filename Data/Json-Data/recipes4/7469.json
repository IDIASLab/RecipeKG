As a cook who believes the only path to tender, oven-baked chicken is to slather it in sauces or breading, I almost blew right past this recipe.  But, desperate for simplicity, I chose this -- the most tender, melt-in-your-mouth chicken ever!  Instead of salt, I sprinkled both sides of each buttered breast with McCormick's Grill Mates Montreal Chicken Seasoning.  My chicken breasts were quite large, so I baked these about 50 or 55 minutes in order to reach 165 degrees, and I basted them a few times with the juices while baking.  I'm thinking this recipe will work quite well for my low-carb way of eating.  Definitely our new favorite!  Give it a try.",

I hope that Fran, one of the previous reviewers, sees this.  Not all people who cook this are the morons she seems to think they are.  Turn on the oven?  was her comment.  Yet she  claims to love this site...every recipe in here that requires cooking tells you to \"turn on the oven\"!  Maybe she is so righteous cause she thinks she has earned the right since she is a grandmother.  Well I am too and sincerely hope I never learn her attitude toward people of any age who want to learn.  IMO, Allrecipes fits the bill for levels , ages and genders of  cooks.",

I used the chicken to make chicken salads for dinner. I do like my usual evoo, b/c it's a bit more healthy, but I would totally make this again, as it was very good! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Then we discard the bones and skin---but they add so much flavor to the chicken that we really don't need anything else to go with this.  In place of the salt I used Papa's Seasoning from this site because it is such a flavorful blend of spices.  I use Trader Joe's package of Kosher Chicken Breasts (two halves to a package), and so I halved the recipe.  I really liked the butter and will continue to do so now.  Yum!  It was really tasty!
