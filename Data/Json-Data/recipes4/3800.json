I am an expert chef and this is a wonderful appetizer, with these changes.  I put 1/4 cup of the Parmesan in the cream cheese mixture and added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder to the mixture and 1/2 tsp. Laurie's lemon pepper to the mixture also.  So I did not need to sprinkle the artichokes with garlic or pepper. Also only dipped the bottoms of the artichokes in butter and that was plenty !  Also I baked at 350 for about 30 minutes.  I got rave reviews at my dinner party.  You must try this.",

I scaled the whole recipe back to use 1 can of bottoms but I ended up having to increase the cream cheese/sour cream mixture again to fill all of them. The lemon pepper gives a nice flavor but I think there is a little more salt going on than I care for so I would probably skip it next time. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and was glad I did for the same reason. Overall excellent! Will definitely make again! Thanks!",

I did not use the amount of lemon pepper called for I just lightly sprinkled it over the artichoke bottoms. I didn't have chives so I just finely chopped a green onion (green top also) and mixed that in. Also I used one can of artichoke bottoms but still used the amount of filling called for in the recipe but maybe my artichokes were bigger than normal. My family really liked them. I will definately make this recipe again! Thanks for posting.:)",
