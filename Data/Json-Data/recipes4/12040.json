Teriyaki a Japanese sauce is combined with peanut butter to emulate satay-style pork. But that needs to be grilled for best effect. In order to give it more of a Thai flavor I added a kaffir lime leaf a bit of fish sauce instead of the teriyaki and some shallots. All in all the taste was okay but too peanut buttery. And shredded peanut butter pork on rice just felt...wrong. It was tender and pulled very easily but I think it is more suited to a sandwich or something. Not bad but I found myself asking \"what do I DO with this stuff?\"",

We just added in our own extra red pepper hot sesame oil and teriyaki or soy sauce to suit our own tastes. If you were serving this for a mixed crowd - this is definitely the way to go - as you don't know who is spice-adverse. I must say though that I didn't measure my PB exactly - so I may have used a bit more than the recipe called for. Also after the pork cooled for a bit in the slow cooker - the peanut butter flavor really hit it's peak and it was wonderful! Next time I make it - I think I will leave a bit more time for the shredded pork to cook in the juices and then SLIGHTLY cool in the slow cooker before serving. I am looking forward to leftovers tonight.",

It was almost pointless. They just disintegrated. Only use peppers and add them close to finishing the dish - maybe 1/2 hour or 45 minutes.",
