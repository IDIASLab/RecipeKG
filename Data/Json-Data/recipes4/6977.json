Used a potato masher to break up the sweet potatoes a little at the end. Very flavorful and satisfying! Will make again!",

I cooked it in a soup pot and the soup came to the top. I used rotisserie chicken for ease. For the 10 cups of broth I used an equal amount of water and 8 tsp of broth powder (the package called for 20 tsp). Anymore and it would have been too salty. I didnt add the optional parsnips or dill. I had 4 small sweet potatoes already baked. So I just added them the last 10 minutes. I am wondering if a quick barley wouldnt be better. I think some instant or a little bit of regular rice would have been more to my liking. The barley was chewy still after over 30 minutes and a bit dominant in the soup.",
