I used leftover spaghetti and added parsley (personal taste) and a couple tablespoons of milk (to help keep from drying out).  I think the milk wasn't so necessary as watching the dish.  I don't think it needs very much time in the oven.  The oven is what dries out the pasta and everything is already cooked, so it's best just to leave it in to melt the cheese rather than wait for it to be brown.  Covering with foil might be another option, too.  Overall - very good for a quick side!",

Quite a few other reviews said it was dry; I foresaw that and added in some butter, which helped but wasn't enough.  The cheese was in melted globs throughout the dish.  I think making a roux and creating a sauce would fix that.  I added Parmesan cheese too.  Really good flavors but I think making a little sauce would really help.

My friends are VERY picky eaters and they all loved it. It was simple and good. I don't think it was too dry at all - just make sure that you don't discard the oil in which the brocoli is cooked. As the brocoli is cooking it makes some water a little bit of which can also be tossed in with the pasta. All in all I really liked this recipe and will definitely make it again. I served it with some vegetarian eggplant marinara on the side for those who like things saucy.",
