I took a dinner plate and poured olive oil on it with a dash of Kosher Salt. After rinsing and patting the meat dry - I placed the roast in the olive oil to coat both sides. I grilled & seared both sides for 3 min. each. I put the roast on top of a bay leaf in the pre-heated pan (also lightly dusted with Kosher Salt). I poured half a can of beef broth in the pan (not over the meat) with whole garlic cloves. I took the roast out after the first hour and continued the recipe with a can of condensed cream of mushroom and a can of condensed cream of asparagus soups. I mixed those two with fresh chives from the garden. I put potatoes and brussel sprouts in the pan, poured the soup mixture over the meat and vegtables and covered with aluminum for an hour and a half.  I put fresh asparagus in the pan the last half hour of cooking. Then topped with cheese.  YUM! It was heaven.  ",

Made a mixture with Montreal Steak Seasoning basil and olive oil and seared it in a pan for about 2 minutes on each side to brown. Roasted two big spoonfuls of garlic in olive oil and rubbed it into the roast before I put it in the oven. I used 4 potatoes a smaller container of mushrooms and a pound of baby carrots with the two cans of cream of mushroom no chives for us. It came out wonderfully! Made this for my husband for valentines day dinner and will defiantly make it again!",
