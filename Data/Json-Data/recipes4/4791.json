Made some homemade 1000 Island and found I didn't have any kraut so added a little dressing in place of it. Laid the second half of the sheet over the top. I'm not sure what the sealing to the pan part was for? I didn't extend the bottom crust up the sides of the pan either. Taste of a reuben but I did miss the rye bread. I didn't have any problem with it being soggy the crescent roll sheet was nice and crunchy. These would be great as an appetizer! Thanks for the recipe.",

I also subbed 2 cups of shredded jack cheese because I don't care for Swiss. I used a 16 oz jar of sauerkraut with 2/3 c Thousand Island. My bottom crust sank down the sides of my pan. I pressed my saurkraut, rather than squeezing it, and my bottom crust, where the top and bottom crusts met, was soggy )= Next time I will brush the bottom crust with egg white before pre-baking it. We both enjoyed this, and are looking forward to leftovers (= [I did find the corned beef right after she sliced the pastrami for me - so next time I will make it with corned beef (=] edit: When I got back home, I took my leftover portions and flipped them over in the pan, making sure the soggy portions were exposed and threw it back in the oven for another ~20 minutes to dry it out. Just had some leftovers for dinner at work - yum!",

Reading Christina's review I decided to use 2 tubes of crescent rolls to make the dough easier to spread. I baked this in a Pampered Chef 8 1/2 x 11 1/2 stoneware pan and this was a perfect size for 2 tubes crescent rolls. I increased the ingredients to equal a recipe and a half. After mixing up the dressing and sauerkraut I added a little extra dressing to make it a little creamier. I let the recipe rest as the instructions called for and this cut and plated beautifully. The crescent rolls make this sweeter than a traditional Reuben but it is still a very good recipe worth making. I forgot about the egg wash and added a few caraway seeds to the topping.",
