I used leftover roasted chicken to make this come together faster, but any kind of lean cooked meat can be used in this recipe. To make a vegetarian version, omit the meat and use vegetable stock instead of chicken.",

So this recipe has a lot going for it. It tasted good but we like lots of flavor and this was a little on the bland side for our taste. I cooked the Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken Recipe (from this site) in a skillet and then saut\u00e9ed the vegetables and quinoa in the same skillet to add some flavor. When I make it again (and I will make it again) I will probably use blackened chicken to add more flavor.",
