                "reviewBody": "My \"day\" starts at 0500 dark and my job is very physical so I am always looking for a breakfast that is easy to transport (just can't eat right after waking (0200))that is also packed with protein. I tried this as written the first time and thought it was dry and lacking.  I followed the original recipe but made a few changes to my taste.  I used turkey sausage; I did not thaw or drained the frozen spinach (extra liquid is needed); used low-fat cream cheese, not Neufchatel; added about 1/3 cup of diced onion; diced a small (6.5 oz) can of mushroom pieces and stems; chopped one (8 oz) can of sliced water chestnuts; added one egg and did my usual generous sprinkling of crushed red pepper flakes.  With the added ingredients it makes a lot and could easily fill 4 cans of crescent rolls, however, evenly divide the remainder and freeze. I had eaten 2 of these biscuits before we started our work leaving one for our 7 AM break. A co-worker was hungry at 0700 and I offered my remaining biscuit of which she savored and then talked about it the rest of the day..:)).  I had no issues of leakage and cooked on parchment paper on a pizza pan. This is terrific right out of the oven or cold and any way it is looked at great for those on the go mornings and much better tasting than any drive-thru!  I gave this 4 stars as a base recipe then adjust to what you like.  Enjoy!!",

They were grabbing them up as soon as they came out of the oven! As another reviewer suggested, I added some minced garlic and diced onion to the mix. I also used fresh spinach, since that is what I had on hand. They were a big hit!\n\nAs others have pointed out, this recipe makes way too much filling for one can of crescent rolls. I used three cans, plus one sheet of puff pastry to use all of the filling. If somebody can stuff all that filling into one can of crescent rolls, they\u2019ve got me beat! I did have some difficulty getting the small crescent roll triangles to cover all the filling, but I made it work. They were delicious, even if they weren\u2019t perfectly proportioned. \n\nI\u2019ll definitely be hanging on to this recipe. Thanks for sharing!",
