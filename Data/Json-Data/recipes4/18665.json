The only one thing I will change next time is that I will brown them on each side prior to adding the water. Just a matter of personal preference when it comes down to it. I will be going to the Asian market again soon to get more wrappers just so I can have these in my freezer at all times. Thanks for sharing!",

The recipe makes a ton of filling so make sure you have extra goyza wrappers. I thought the sauce was too vinegary so we used teriyaki instead and it tasted great.  Overall I thought it was a fun and delicious recipe to make.",
