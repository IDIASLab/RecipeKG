I made half a recipe and it made a good-sized pot of soup.  I used tomato sauce, put up from my garden, in place of the canned tomatoes.  I had to add a fairly significant amount of both water and additional chicken broth while the soup cooked, as it continued to get thicker and thicker.  While many additions or changes could be made if one felt compelled to, this can be prepared with confidence just as is.",

And I don't know if the lentils I used were the wrong kind but they cooked into mush and I only cooked it for an hour. I used red lentils don't know if that made a difference got them from a health food store that sells them in bulk. My soup turned out very thick and mushy not what I was hoping for. I can't express enough how strong the sausage flavor was it was not very appetizing at all. I think it would have been better if I had used ham instead. Won't make again sorry.",
