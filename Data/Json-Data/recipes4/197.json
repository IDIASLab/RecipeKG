Served it with New England style buns(Top Split) with coleslaw sauerkraut and curly fries for sides. Even the girls were wolfing this down! I've already been asked to make this for several graduation parties this spring. I simmered it for 1 hour before the kids arrived and left it on low as the party progressed (about another 2 hours). The next day three of the other moms called to ask for the recipe! Made a smaller version the next week at the request of the rest of the family and again not a drop was left. It is seldom that I find a recipe that I don't have to adjust other than for quantity but this is one. This is definately one that I will be using for years to come at all types of gatherings and for \"just us\" meals.",
