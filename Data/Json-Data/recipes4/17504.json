Here are my recommendations: Use rice you've already cooked (maybe left over) as the water to rice ratio in this recipe produces dry rice. Also recommend using a GF flour blend rather than just one GF flour. Also recommend adding some xanthan gum. The recipe turned out very crumbly and didn't hold together. Overall I thought flavor was lacking and the consistency was dry. The good part is 8 grams of protein in the recipe per serving.",
