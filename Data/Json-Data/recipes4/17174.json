Didn't like ketchup.\" I increased the onions, not having any leeks, and kept everything else the same, other than browning the slices of smoked sausage after the carrot step and b4 adding the cabbage as we like our sausage crispy around the edges. (I wish I'd used a full pound, b/c even slicing a 1/2 lb. thin, as the recipe indicates, didn't provide enough of a meat-to-veggie-bite ratio.) I found it to be both too sweet (from the ketchup), and too salty (from the Tony C. seasoning and the 4 bouillon cubes), and my daughter found it too spicy, and well, nobody requested the leftovers the next day, which is unfortunate b/c I thought it was pretty good, so I'm sad to say that this recipe probably won't be a repeat around here.",

I made this pretty much as written - my changes being using a liter/quart container of organic chicken broth and 2 teaspoons of the Creole Seasoning Blend from this site (I try to avoid processed foods and additives as much as possible).  I also used an additive free turkey kolbassa for the smoked sausage.  The seasoning was pretty near perfect - a nice little kick from the creole seasoning and salsa and a touch of sweetness from the ketchup.  I would recommend caution and  don't add salt until the end (tasting first) - it was just about right without any additional salt as many of the ingredients already had salt in them.  I also found that I needed another 2 cups of broth - and it was still really thick (but we like that).  A definite \"make again\" and will try some of the variations suggested.",
