Because they are much smaller I bumped the heat down to 400 and let them go for an hour and that was perfect. They came out super juicy and tender. I sprinkled paprika over them halfway through cooking but mostly only for color. This is a simple straight forward and no fail recipe.",

I also substituted lemon olive oil instead of plain olive oil and added two cloves of minced garlic to the skin.  I roasted it in my cast iron pan with purple Brussel sprouts, carrots, parsnips and zucchini.  My son and I believe that this was the best roasted chicken I have ever made.  The flavor of the meat from the way the celery and garlic stuffed the cavity was amazing and I loved this recipe for its ease and flavor.  None better!",
