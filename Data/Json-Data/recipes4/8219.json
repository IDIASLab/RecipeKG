I cook the veggies and quinoa separate and add garlic and onion powder to taste when cooking the veggies. Then, before I add the quinoa to the veggies i add a can of rinsed and drained cannellini bean. I leave off the olives and cilantro and top with Parmesan cheese instead. I also use more veggies to get a better ratio of veggies to quinoa.",
