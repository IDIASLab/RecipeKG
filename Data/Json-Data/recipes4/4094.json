I sorta merged two versions of this recipe...an old cookbook which had a bunch of spices and traditional cooking methods and this recipe which had modern versions and methods in it. Kept the tomatoes (awesome), used the microwave for the potatoes and cauliflower (brilliant), eliminated the oil (cooking spray), used real ginger and garlic (tsp each), no curry powder as I hate it (sub garam masala for pure awesomeness). Amazingly, this does not include turmeric or cumin (~1/2 tsp each), which I consider crucial (very earthy) but in a pinch the recipe is sufficient as is. I have tried paneer, carrots, chicken, and sweet potatoes for this recipe (dependent on what I have on-hand), all amazing in their own right. If you like a creamier gravy add equal parts milk or cream + broth to the sauce at the end. simmer until thickened. Serves well with chopped cilantro, mango chutney and/or yogurt.",
