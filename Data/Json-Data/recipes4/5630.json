As I had it on hand, I used chicken fat skimmed from soup instead of other fats to saute them.  Doubled the garlic and added black pepper at the same time as garlic to cook a moment before adding the boiled greens.  The onions caramelized, which along with red pepper flakes, was the making of this dish.   Served them with dollop of plain Greek yogurt, and then ate leftovers cold the next morning with curried scrambled eggs.  Delicious and not bitter at all!!",
