My family and I were not disappointed! I didn't have Madeira wine so I substituted Chicken broth. Also most of the spices I had dried from my garden so I only guessed the amount I put in (I may have been a little heavy handed). I would love to try this recipe with sausage instead of chicken and add some fresh spinach to the mix and some feta cheese along with the mozzarella. But it was very good the way it was written.

I also marinated my chicken in italian dressing for even more flavor and used some extra spices. Depite these efforts this just didn't knock me out. The wine was lost perhaps more in the sauce? Maybe some red pepper flakes too. And I might add some chunks of hot italian sausage mixed with the chicken pieces. Hubs said this was \"not up to my standard\" OUCH!
