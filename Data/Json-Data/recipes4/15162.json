I used a whole pound of ground chicken and a leftover chicken breast, a large can of crushed tomatos instead of soup, chicken stock instead of water, black beans instead of red kidney, parsnips instead of carrots, and the whole can of lite coconut milk. I used extra hot mango chutney and doubled the amount called for. I added onion, sweet potato, red bell pepper, a pinch of hot red pepper flakes and a tablespoon of fresh ginger. This was delicious served over brown rice. It was sweet, spicy, earthy and rich. This is obviously a very adaptable recipe, however I would definitely not skip the hot mango chutney. It really makes this special. It was extra excellent the next day over whole wheat couscous with an extra dollop of chutney and a sprinkle of toasted unsweetened coconut. I love this recipe idea and will make it often with or without tweaks.",

A few personal tweaks: (i) 1 lb. ground turkey rather than 1/2 lb.; (ii) 1 1/4 cups low sodium beef broth rather than like amount of water; (iii) 18.7 oz. Campbell\u2019s Harvest Tomato w/ Basil rather than 2 cans (21.5 oz.) of regular tomato soup; (iv) Hot Mango Chutney rather than regular mango chutney (only if some heat is preferred); (v) lite coconut milk rather than regular. Submitter and reviewers say this chili gets better the next day but the first batch we made was devoured, and never made it that long. Anyone who really likes this dish, try Sweet and Spicy Curry with Chickpeas on this site . . . some differences but many similarities to this fantastic recipe. usmcwifey . . . this was so, so good that we\u2019re going to try your Curry Chicken Salad, personal recipe.

Now here is what I changed I sauteed 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil 3 cloves of minced garlic & diced carrots for 7 minutes then added frozen vegi crumbles (instead of turkey). I sauteed until cooked through. I then followed the second part of the recipe using 2 cans of tomato sauce(instead of soup) and using vegi broth(in place of water. I skipped adding the carrots & garlic to the tomato mixture since I already sauteed it with the \"meat\". I used fat free coconut milk and added it at the end after everything is cooked together for the stated time. I followed the recipes measurements of the spices. I hope these are helpful suggestions for vegetarians out there that are craving a hearty or even meat eaters that want to try healthier options.",
