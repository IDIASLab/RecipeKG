A few tips for those of you who really did like this cake but would like the chips to not sink here are some tips: 1. Use 2 ounces of grated chocolate (do not grate too fine) 2. Use 2/3 cup chocolate chips 3. Use an extra tablespoon of vanilla pudding to make the consistancy thicker. This holds the chips in place. 4. When the cake is cooled sprinkle the top with powdered sugar. This has been a huge hit with my family extended family co-workers and friends. I am always asked to make this for whatever the occassion may be. HOPE THIS HELPS!!! Megan",

We used the food processor to chop some choco chips into bitty pieces instead of grating a piece of chocolate. We also used all semi-sweet instead of milk chocolate. We used a white cake mix instead of yellow and we used the entire package of vanilla instant pudding (5.1 oz). We baked it in a bundt pan. It turned out perfect. Very moist and delicious. We will make this one again.",

The chips did sink to the bottom of the cake like the other reviewers found but it was still good. It still tasted somewhat like a cake mix something I was trying to kind of disguise but it was definitely better than a plain cake mix. It had somewhat of a pleasant chocolate chip cookie flavor. WARNING to those who might use this cake to make a \"cut\" cake for a special occasion (you know like those cute teddy bears rockets trains and so forth that you cut cake apart and reassemble to make): at least in my experience this cake was not a good fit for that! The chocolate chips made the bottom part of the cake really hard to cut through cleanly so it started to fall apart. Frosting didn't cling well to the cut part either. I was making a castle with three layers of cake stacked up and was trying to square it up a little. Needless to say that part became the back that nobody looked at! Anyway that aside this recipe makes a decent cake that's not fabulous but definitely better than a plain cake mix something my parents appreciated because they're tired of eating boring cakes (for some reason I don't understand I started a tradition of special character and theme cakes so most of the cakes I make look better than they taste).",
