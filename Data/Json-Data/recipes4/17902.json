The cabbage wedges, you need to remove core and should be broken up into separate leaves. Then scatter them into baking dish. The rest of the assembly is correct. \nHint regarding my crushed garlic:  I keep it in a jar covered in a good olive oil in the frig. \nAlso you NEED to stir it at least once after 15-20mins and adjust seasoning. I find that I have to add water. Oh, Its ok to use garlic power too.  I hope these points improve your dish. \nEnjoy, Ricardo.",

I was looking for an alternative to coleslaw, and really wanted something warm for winter, this was very flavorful and I loved how simple it was to make.
