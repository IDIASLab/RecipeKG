They are kind of like a meatless meatball...or as someone commented, like a little individual bite of stuffing without the turkey.  I wasn't sure how the margarine would mix in with the rest of the ingredients, so I used a pastry blender to cut it directly into the 2 cups of bread crumbs before adding that to the rest of the ingredients.  I also added just a little oregano for extra flavor.  After adding the milk, I let the mixture soak for about a 1/2 hour before forming into balls.  It would probably be OK to let this mixture sit in the refrigerator for hours before forming into the balls if it fits your schedule better.  Next time I make it, I might reduce the amount of margarine to 1/3 cup--I just didn't see the need for that much margarine.  Also, I had no problem with the final product sticking to the pan after baking as others commented.  Maybe they used \"reduced fat\" margarine (I did not).  Next time I think I might try adding crumbled cooked bacon in with the mixture.  That would add a little more flavor, although I thought the flavor was fine as it was.  Thanks for sharing!",

Sampled again and still thought they lacked something.  So I tried them with salsa. I liked that.  So I baked some more and flattened the balls in order to have more area for the Salsa! I may try this recipe again, but I will certainly play around with more spices and perhaps cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon. I did prefer the flattened product.  It is a fine basic recipe, and easily changed to accommodate personal taste.  ",

Be sure your broccoli is drained well. I simplified the preparation by chopping everything together in my food processor scooping balls of the \"dough\" with a cookie scoop and placing on the baking sheet. I did bake them longer than stated for approximately 25 minutes. I look forward to making these again and adding different ingredients to get a variety of flavors: Spinach & feta red pepper & goat cheese and adding red pepper to the original recipe would be perfect for Christmas! These would also be good with some added garlic. Thanks for a fun versatile recipe!",

I also cut back on the onion just a tad and next time I'll use fresh onion as suggested by the other reviewer. I think too that if one doesn't have any plain bread crumbs seasoned stuffing could be used and cut back on the other spices? Thank you and I just love this site.
