I increased the amount of liquid by 3-4 times keeping the amount of mustard and thyme the same as listed and it tasted great to me. More thyme would probably have overwhelmed it. Also instead of putting it in the oven I cooked mine in the slow cooker after browning the beef on the stovetop. All in all it made for a wonderful meal my fiance had three helpings!

I used a 9 x 13 pan and it nicely held 2 #s of meat and all the other ingredients. I also used baby carrots. I did not have boullion cubes so I used one can of beef stock in place of 1 cup of water. I also used Merlot wine. I added a bag of frozen peas about 15 min. before it was done. Next time I'd add some boiled potatoes along with the peas. I'd also add a tsp. of Gravy Master or Kitchen Bouquet for a bit of color as it was a bit \"grey.\" I had to add a bit more thickener in the form of cold water and flour because it did not get thick with the 3 T. of flour. All in all I liked the flavor and unlike on top of stove cooking with no lid the flavor of the wine did not seem to evaporate so it was quite tasty. A definite winner.",

Kept it tightly covered in the oven for 2 1/2 hours....didn't need 4 hrs. A little Texas garlic toast was perfect to go with it. My boyfriend had 2 servings.
