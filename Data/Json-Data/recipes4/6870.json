They smelled pretty good before cooking but tastewise after just okay. No big deal. 'Couldn't really tell I'd used barbecue at all - & it was spicy. It definitely improved the flavor when put on the burgers but ho-hum without. Maybe dry rub spices would be a better option.",

Only change I made was subbing 2 Tblsp of very finely minced yellow onion for the green. I used Guy Fieri brown sugar bourbon bbq sauce I had leftover from another recipe. I shaped them using a mashed potato scoop and got 8 smaller burgers. To save time I also broiled them. I thought they would have been good with some garlic so I just sprinkled some garlic salt on top after they were done. That helped some. For a quick and easy complete meal I served them with Ore Ida baked tater tots.",
