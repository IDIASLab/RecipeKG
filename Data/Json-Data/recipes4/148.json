It's wonderful, cheap and easy. You cannot sub the soup for marinara sauce, it is NOT the same thing. * Also, you kind of have to appreciate this meal for what it is, a basic and cheap, depression era meal that serves a big family for pennies, this is not a gourmet meal. If that is what you are looking for please spare this a bad review and look for something else.* I usually season my meat with season salt, pepper and garlic, maybe some other stuff if feeling fancy but that will do. Sometimes add a can of diced tomatoes or peppers as well. I usually save just a little of the tomato soup for the leftovers, as they tend to get a little dry, so I save just a little to spread on top before sticking in the fridge.",

I tweaked it a bit, after reading the reviews...used slightly less pasta, added some garlic, italian seasoning, a teaspoon of beef bouillion, and a 4oz jar of mushrooms...and it made a big batch, enough for dinner and the leftovers will make a couple of hearty lunches! Thanks for posting April, great recipe!\n\nEdited to add: I've made this multiple times since my first review, and I now use 3 cans of tomato soup...and I thin it a bit with about a 1/4 cup of water...2 cans of soup is not enough.",
