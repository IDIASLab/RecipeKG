Very easy to do and perfect over grilled burgers and I'm sure would be just as good on grilled chicken sandwiches too. I can't wait to try it as a dip for crackers and veggies!

I made 1 full batch with Bleu Cheese I made another full batch with Feta cheese and the third batch (recipe scaled down to 1 serving) with shredded Cheddar cheese. Everyone loved their hamburgers with this topping. What to do with the leftover Bleu Cheese topping? Later in the week I spread the leftover Bleu Cheese mixture on the leftover hamburger buns and popped them under the broiler. It melted up so nicely and got a golden brown color. My BC hating husband thought the bread was delicious. I didn't tell him what he was eating! This recipe is so delicious Christina I've given the recipe out a few times. It will be made again and again and again in this house. Thanks for sharing.",
