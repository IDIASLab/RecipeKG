My slow cooker took closer to 2 hours to cook everything, and then it was extremely hot, so beware of that potential. I'd recommend whisking every 15-20 minutes until the chocolate dissolves. But this is far tastier than the powdered mixes and kids love the rich chocolate flavor, and adults can turn it into an adult drink also.",

Turn it down on low after it gets hot though. Absolutely delicious with marshmallows on a sugar cane dipped in milk chocolate and rolled in peppermint chips. Yum!!!",
