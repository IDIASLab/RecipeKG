The recipe calls for 2 measurements of minice onion  when there should be only 1.. I prefer to use fresh chopped onion . I cook it at the same time I brown my meat. (ground beef or whole steak diced in bite sized cubes) I don't measure just toss in a handful.  When the meat is cooked I add the box of vermiceli and cook the noodles stirring until brown.  Cover with water. Add tomato, spices , salt and pepper to taste and cook on low until pasta is tender. about 10 minutes.   I don not use green bell pepper in my recipe. On occasions I add a small potato cut in small cubes and add it to the fideo when I add the water. Cook until fideo and diced potato are done. Do not over cook fideo.",

I am a little confused by the \"mexican spaghetti\". Fideo as I know it is soup which is what I originally had when I turned the stove off but the noodles absorbed so much of the liquid within a few minutes that \"mexican spaghetti\" is what ended up on the dinner table. Regardless, the flavor was good. You'll just need to add more liquid (I chose spicy V-8) if you want the more soup consistency.",

I wasn't sure what Fideo noodles were but what I could find on the internet said that it was spaghetti so that is what I used. I followed the recipe but I had to add about 4 cups of water to get the noodles completely cooked. It was kind of strong on the onion and garlic flavor for me. I think I would cut the onion and garlic powder in half if I make this again.",
