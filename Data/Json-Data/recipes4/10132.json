Husband loved it!  He had three big helpings.  Son (9 years old) just thought it was ok but did eat it.  I diced the carrots up really small and he didn't even notice them, he hates carrots.  When I make this again I will only use 8 cups of water instead of the 10 the recipe calls for.  We thought the soup was a little thin and we prefer a thicker version of Split Pea Soup.  Otherwise it was very yummy and I will definitely make it again!  Diced ham would be good in this soup too!",

I used 8 cups of chicken broth instead of the 10 cups of water.  I also used fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic powder.  \n\nI only added about half of the peas in the beginning...I was getting nervous around 3 hours because it didn't seem to be cooking at all!  But then about a half hour later it was really going and I added the rest of the peas, and it went for a total of about 5 hours on high.  So it came out with a nice thick pea mush with some whole pieces too.\n\nI was a little nervous about the lack of a lot of \"seasonings and spices\" here...but trust the recipe and use a good quality pea and meat and the flavors will really come out where they are supposed to!  Hubby says best pea soup yet!",

I ended up cooking it on High for about 5 hours and then low another 2 because I forgot about it:) it turned out great anyways and was nice and thick and creamy. Went great with a box of Jiffy cornbread an effortless meal to walk in the door to! A definite keeper THANKS!!",
