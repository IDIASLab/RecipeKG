                "reviewBody": "I love this recipe and have made is so many times with variations here and there. The first time I made it as is it was still great though! But here is what I've learned. I prefer using chicken base (better than bouillon brand) over vegetable bouillon cubes as it is what I have on hand. I also use a 29 ounce can of diced tomatoes over the smaller rotel with chiles although I sometimes add the canned chiles separately. I typically put the beans in from the beginning as I see no reason not to and they cook fine for the full time. My biggest stray from the recipe is that I never put the zucchini slices and garlic in the bottom as it just turns to weird mush. I love roasting a head of garlic and the zucchini slices pureeing them and then putting them in the crock pot. However that's a bit of extra work so I typically just mince about 6 cloves of garlic and shred the zucchini and throw that in the crockpot. It works so well and turns out great. I add a little salt and pepper to taste. Also never hurts to add a bay leaf and some other seasoning to taste. Really terrific base recipe.",

Doubled the recipe which wasn't the best idea as my crock pot couldn't hold it all. Had to transfer to a stock pot the last 2 hours. Unfortunately my rice didn't cook all the way. I think I need more liquid next time and to cut my pork into smaller pieces before putting it into the pot as I had to cook in the crock pot longer to get the pork to shred (something I usually have no problem with). Not the fault of the recipe just some observations. I may prefer boil the rice a bit next time. Even after 2 hours of slow simmer there's a bit of a crunch to most pieces of rice. Good recipe and definitely different! Will make again. More of a jambalaya feel to it.",
