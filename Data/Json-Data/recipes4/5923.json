The picture shown does display a chicken that was cooked in a bag, but the chicken was also roasted with vegetables and needed the bag to immerse the vegetables in the chicken flavor.

I didn't have garlic salt so I used a bit of salt mixed with garlic powder. I also opted to add a bit of onion powder to the mix.  I put it in the roaster and covered it with non-stick foil and let it set in the fridge all day.  I stuffed the cavity with some onion and celery let it come to room temp. and baked it for about three hours and it smelled divine. This was so incredibly moist, tender, and delicious without a ton of effort - great recipe!",

I did put most of the butter (not margarine) either under the skin or in the cavity, otherwise following the directions.  You could add whatever you wanted to the cavity (onion?  garlic?), but whatever, this is delicious.  Most of the butter doesn't stick to the chicken, but it certainly makes a great chicken, let me tell you!  And right now I've had the carcass and all the other bones, carrots, celery, and onion in a pot so that I will have the best broth in the world.  We will have several meals from this chicken!  Thanks so much for the recipe!",

I didn't change the portions of ingredients but I did distribute them differently.... 1) Half of the rub was more than enough to coat the chicken under the skin AS WELL AS over the skin.  2) I mixed the other half of the rub with some chopped onions (about half an onion) and 4 minced garlic cloves and stuffed the inside of the chicken with that. AMAZING flavor. The chicken turned out so moist and delicious and the skin was nice and crispy.",
