                "reviewBody": "Recipe is great. Cooking squash in advance will avoid having a mushy end product, as squash is up to 90% water. Most of the water will evaporate when cooked in the skillet. The small amount of water added in the skillet at the start of cooking it is to prevent scorching/sticking until the squash breaks down and releases its own water. Do not put a lid on the skillet to allow for evaporation. Do not omit the other ingredients unless you substitute. The egg, milk, and cracker crumbs act as binders and thickeners (the flour from the crackers). I do not add the extra salt. Dotting the top with butter is an error- the butter will not melt all over. Dotting of butter such as inside an apple pie will work fine as the top crust will seal the pie and allow the butter to spread but not in this case. The butter will only melt downward from where it is placed. Mix the melted butter with the cracker crumbs then spread on the top. This is a standard type recipe and any type of cooked vegetable or type of cracker can be used if you prefer. If you want it to be outstanding (and extra calories but delicious), use only real butter and heavy cream.",

The texture beneath the crust was mushy (but still yummy) so I tried baking the casserole for 10-15 min and then putting the crust on to brown. It wasn't quite as mushy this way, and I also didnt simmer the veggies first- they still get plenty tender for my taste but you avoid a mushy product. Will try adding some meat next time for a main dish! Thanx for a good recipe!!",
