The shitakes made our gravy pure magic and the addition of a little heavy cream was perfect to lighten and soften the gravy too. \n\nI made this gravy with the meatloaf recipe found on this site called \"Brown Sugar Meatloaf\" without the brown sugar and ketchup, also substituted the crackers for Italian Seasoned Breadcrumbs and a heartier dose of garlic.\n\nRemember the beef stock is a big part of this recipe, either make your own (big pain) or use the thick lard-like stocks like \"better than bullion\". I find a huge upgrade in those stocks and they are available in chicken, beef and turkey.\n\nMy wife is a life long meatloaf lover and I am a lifelong meatloaf hater. I made this meal for her and we were both saying \"Mmmmmm\" the whole time and she said it was the best meatloaf of her life! \n\nThanks Chef John",

                "reviewBody": "I would have given this recipe about 3 stars for flavor, & that's considering this is really a recipe for MEATLOAF GRAVY rather than for meatloaf, so my rating is based on the METHOD/GRAVY ALONE. I made this recipe exactly as written & IMHO the gravy was good, but NOT great. It reminds me of a gravy I might have tasted in a TV dinner or at Denny's (edible, I wouldn't have sent it back, but I wouldn't have bothered to clean my plate or save any leftovers nor would I never order this again). The fact that it uses shitake mushrooms seems like it would add to the flavor, but it only seems to add to the cost of the dish. Sorry, Chef John, but I've tried a few gravy recipes that called for cans of cream of mushroom soup that cost MUCH less than this one & were easier to prepare & tasted just as good or better. I started off rating this recipe 3 stars for flavor, but knocked off stars because (1) it takes extra time/expense to make than a canned-mushroom-soup-gravy & IMHO this recipe isn't any better (2) cooking the meatloaf IN the gravy makes for a VERYVERYGREASY gravy & just skimming the grease wasn't enough for, I had to get out the gravy strainer & this is an extra step that I didn't care for - why not just make the gravy separately? 3) Personal preference - we like to have a crisp outer layer on our meatloaf & using this recipe/method the whole loaf comes out very moist...like tv-dinner-meatloaf-all-around-moist-throughout..which isn't what we like/expect/want in a meatloaf.",

                "reviewBody": "Good basic idea. I used ground venison instead (10% fat) used 1 T. butter and 1 T. olive oil and non-fat yogurt instead of the heavy cream. It didn't yield quite the amount of sauce I would have liked but the flavor was good. The rosemary and mushrooms complemented each other perfectly... My only complaint was there was no specific amount of flour called for so I had to just guess at how much to use...but the sauce turned out a good consistency. Great new way to make meatloaf.",
