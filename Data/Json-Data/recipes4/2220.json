He only had two fillets, and he kept the fillets whole and did not cube them. He used about three cloves of fresh garlic instead of the stuff in a jar. He also used red wine since we didn\u2019t have any white on hand. We also didn\u2019t have any diced tomatoes with the peppers; but we did have a can of diced tomatoes with basil, so he used that and added a bit of his dried red peppers. It was raining, so he put it into the oven and baked it at 450. We had no idea if we\u2019d like this dish; so as soon as it came out of the oven, we both sampled it. It was so delicious that we ate it immediately. (We forgot the cheese.)  The fish was very moist. This is a very easy recipe and the flavor was awesome! We both said we would definitely make this again.",

I made a few changes: 1) Used olive oil instead of butter--was good but next time I will try the butter (or do half and half oil and butter). 2) Did not have jarred garlic so used garlic powder 3) Used bottled lemon juice as I did not have fresh lemons 4) Used motzerrela cheese as did not have pepperjack--next time I will try the pepperjack 5) Baked the fish at 350 for 30 minutes in a covered casserole dish instead of grilling 6) I added green and red bell peppers yellow squash mushrooms along with the onion--which really turned out very well Delicious--Great recipe--thanks!!",
