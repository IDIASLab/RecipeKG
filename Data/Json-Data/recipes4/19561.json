When pressure cooking the ckicken, I add my favorite seasonings and water, cooked a bit longer and created a stock for the soup instead of using broth. I think having a good stock is key component for adding flavor. Next I used gluten free gnocchi, 2 boxes which was slightly less than what was called for. I also used 2 bags of preshaved parm that was just under the amount needed. Overall, it was a tasty soup that 4 out of my 5 family members enjoyed it and I will be making it again as long as I can get GF gnocchi.",
