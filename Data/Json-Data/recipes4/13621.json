        "description": "Earlier this year, I called my mom to ask her how to make muah yu gei which literally translates to sesame oil chicken in Taiwanese. I love this dish because it's delicious and a great weeknight dish for a busy working lady like myself. No one eats this dish 'as is' like this. You need carbs! I GUESS rice could do, but I will always use 'me sua' which literally translates to 'noodle thread' in Taiwanese. They're a super thin type of noodle used in a lot of Chinese and Japanese cooking, but I have no idea what they're called in English (apparently, they're called somen). Anyways, no substitutes as far as noodles go! You have to get the super thin noodles like the ones I have pictured.",

I also added a good glug of sambal olek to finish it just 'cos I like it spicy:) Upon tasting it seemed to be missing something...so I tipped in a bit of oyster sauce and BINGO! Took it over the top and gave it some nice added depth. I'll be taking this for my lunches at work this week and am planning on sprinkling some chopped green onions on top of each serving (i.e. not cooking them in). Thanks!",

I didn't have dark sesame oil so the sesame oil taste wasn't as strong so next time I will try it with dark (I used light sesame oil). Still the broth was so fragrant and the measurements are all pretty spot on to create the thick broth that sticks to the noodles. My mom's is a bit more brothy but I like this version better since it coats the noodles more. I used skinless boneless chicken thighs and it still tasted great. I had oyster mushrooms and bamboo hearts on hand too so I added those and they tasted great with the flavors.",

I don t understand why I d boil bone in chicken pieces and then just drain away the chicken stock. Also 12 minutes wasn t enough cooking time for the size of my pieces. There was no instructions to debone the pieces but I felt like I had to let them cool and pull off the meat. Just a cup and a half of water doesn t make much broth. I couldn t find the proper noodles so used rice noodles since that was what I could find at my grocers. The soup was not bad but was a lot of work. I m not sure I made it properly but I put in the effort. Probably won t make it again.",
