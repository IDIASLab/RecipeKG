I used mini Reese s pieces on the top and mini Reese chocolates cut in half for the layer between topping and cake. I decided to put the chocolates on the cake while it was cooling (against the recipe s instructions) which resulted in the candies melting which seemed like a good idea however when cutting the cake the peanut butter cups had solidified into a layer between the cake and whipped topping. It was still yummy just a bit difficult to cut. If I make this again I ll follow the directions better:)",
