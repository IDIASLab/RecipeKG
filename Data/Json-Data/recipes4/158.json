The reason so many commented on the frosting being too much for this dessert is a common error.  Many times when a recipe gets passed on to family and friends they leave something out or is comes with personal amendments.  The similar recipe I enjoy calls for you to microwave the canned frosting (IMPORTANT TO REMOVE ALL FOIL FROM INNER SEAL FIRST) for 15 seconds only.  Including this important step changes the consistency of the frosting to a glaze.   It really makes all the difference in the world.  I have never used the whole can of frosting yet,  I save unused portion by replacing lid and storing in refrigerator for another use for up to 2 weeks.",

Also refridgerate 24 hours before eating so the graham crackers get nice and soft...I use French Vanilla Cool Whip and f.v. pudding for a little something extra...mmmm....Hope I've helped. \r\nChocolate Sauce REcipe: originally submitted by BaysChick (Thanks so much!): Mix 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 cup sugar in sauce pan.

They LOVED it!  My suggestion is that you let the desert sit for about ten minutes before icing.  This way the graham crackers mould together with the pudding and it makes the graham crackers easier to ice.  I prepared my own icing and by the time the icing was ready, the pudding and graham crackers were at just the right consistancy where the graham crackers would not break when icing. Try this recipe - everyone will thank you for it!  Enjoy!",

I use a box of French vanilla and a box of cheesecake pudding.  For the frosting, I used a recipe from this site that is no longer available.  It was a chocolate sauce from Bays Chick. The recipe is as follows: 1/3 c. cocoa (I used Ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa), 1 c. sugar, 1 stick butter, 1/4 c. milk.  Bring to a boil for 1 minute.  Remove from heat and add 1 tsp. vanilla.  Cool completely. It thickens nicely and tastes absolutely fabulous! This frosting makes this dessert out of this world!!",
