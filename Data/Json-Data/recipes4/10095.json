Five stars after my additions. Thanks Mai for the great base recipe.",

It was so simple to make (especially using bottled sauce) and was so yummy we each had seconds. I will be making this again soon.",

I sliced the eggplant into 1/3 inch slices then cut each slice in half before sauteeing with the onions as others suggested (skipped the salting/steaming process entirely). Since so many people talked about the recipe needing more sauce I used 28 oz crushed tomatoes with 15 oz diced tomatoes and thought the ratio turned out well. For the yogurt I upped the amount to 24 oz nonfat yogurt-- everyone was so surprised that it wasn't cheese that I think I'll begin using it as a healthier substitute going forward! I baked the layered dish for 30 minutes covered before uncovering to add the topping. I needed a bit more of the breadcrumb/Parmesan mixture to cover the entire pan- probably 1/2 cup combined. Baked that for another 10 minutes then let cool a little before serving. I will be sharing this recipe with friends and definitely making again!!",

My husband (VERY picky eater) LOVED it which is the ultimate test as he doesn't like much! I made a few modications though: I sweat the eggplant slices in a 3/4 vegetable oil 1/4 lemon juice mix with salt and pepper for about 40 minutes. Did not wash them off before steaming them and as I don't have a steamer I had to steam them in a heated pot (with a lid) adding a few Tablespoons of water. (they turned out pretty good!) I also used a 24 oz. pre-made garlic tomatoe sauce mix instead. As well as added some mozzerella in between the layers and one dollop of cream cheese on top of each eggplant slice right in the middle.... This turned out delicious and I highly recommend it!! I followed the rest of the instructions almost exactly but added more wheat germ and parm. cheese to the top than listed! Will definitely be making again!",
