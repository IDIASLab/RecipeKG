After I seared the meat, I couldn't let all the yummy bits on the bottom of the pot go to waste, so I deglazed the pan using some red wine and added that to the mix. I also added mushrooms & celery and a 1/2 cup of red wine. I also used 1 can of Roasted Garlic Mushroom soup and 1 can of lower fat regular Mushroom soup. The meat came out so incredibly fork tender! Like with other reviewers, I ended up with lots of juice. Served it over wide egg noodles. One word=HEARTY!",

It took about a half an hour to throw together in the morning, kept it off until I was ready to walk out the door, fliped it to low, and 8 hours later we had a delicious pot roast.  I made egg noodles and mashed potatoes to go with it, but the potatoes weren't necesary.  between the veggies, noodles and meat, we were to stuffed for the potatoes.  I  added a few diced mushrooms to the gravy, added red wine to the gravy like someone had suggested, I didn't put potatoes in because I made mashed potatoes, but I added 2 red onions, parsnips and Carrots.  This was DELICIOUS and I can't recommend this recipe enough!!!!",

The gravy was very soupy and there was a lot of it so at the end I took the meat and veggies out stirred in about 3 or 4 Tbs cornstarch mixed with a little cold water and that thickened it into a perfect thick gravy. Which we sopped up with crusty french rolls. This was delicious!",

Emeril's spices for flavor. I did not want a thick gravy and it was perfect. I added 2 onions cut in quarters and 1 bag of mini carrots with about 3 hours left of cooking to avoid the mush factor. The potatoes I put in 1 hour after meat was cooking. I recommend the searing. It made it very flavorable. I cooked it for about 7 hours and it was plenty. It is a great crockpot recipe and a wonderful Sunday night dinner! Thanks for the recipe.",

Because I didn't have enough potatoes or carrots for the stew I put in mushrooms and celery. I also seasoned the tri-tip with season-all before browning it. I used one can of cream of Mushroom with roasted garlic because I didn't have two cans of regular cream of mushroom soup. the mixture was terrific. the gravy this roast recipe made was so good that we used it the next night over rice and the left over meat.
