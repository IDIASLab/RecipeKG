I used the milk called for and added another cup of milk and about 1-2 cups of water. The texture was very smooth and creamy. I also added a couple teaspoons of dried dill. Not sure why you \"slice\" the potatoes but if I make again I would cut into cubes. When the soup was done I ended up \"breaking\" up the potatoes with my wooden spoon. Be careful during the first 30 minutes of cooking (higher heat). It will boil over and make a mess. But delicious soup. Made it last night and this morning my boyfriend commented again how good it was. Served it with a salad. Also we had lots of left overs which will probably be even better when re-heated.",
