Put in on high or low and you're good to go.  I also add a red pepper and onion packet to the mix.  I've also made this exactly 'as is' (except I still added the red pepper and onion mix) and it tastes the same as doing it in the crockpot.   I've also used this in my tamales!  You can make this in a variety of ways and it's still great!  Two thumbs up! ** Edited**  I am editing this from my original review from mid-August 2007, because I've made this several times since and have done it various ways.  I've now decided that the best way and the only way I'll make it is this way.  Put the meat in the crockpot and fill it with water.  Slice up an onion and add the entire jar of green salsa.  (That means I purchase two jars of green salsa, because the second jar I use later.)  Cover and cook for 8 hours/low.  A hour before I'm ready for dinner, I'll cut up and saute the peppers/onions.  When that's finished or near the end, I'll drain the water out of the crockpot and shred the meat in the crockpot.  Then I add the sauted peppers/onions, a jar of green salsa, I even add a bit of red salsa (it tastes good with a bit of it added), and the onion mix.  That's how I'll make it from now on, because somehow it just tastes better this way. Delicious!",

Although this isn't a \"traditional\" form of the recipe it's an adapted version which is pretty much a shredded beef filling (and what you're most likely to see in restaurants). Anyway I did the first part of this in the crockpot and when it came to putting everything together on the stove I used pimientos instead of the bell pepper. Can't wait to try the leftovers with eggs (another common method of cooking this). Thanks!",
