I love me some green onions but have to think this was supposed to be 4 onions and not 4 bunches. With that being said why limit yourself to just broccoli when they make the frozen stir-fry blend? That is what I used which gave me variety and also a lot more color. Great recipe for times when you just don't have time in the kitchen.",

I used half of a large Vidalia onion rather than green onion simply because I don't keep green onion handy. In the last step I put the lid on the stir-fry to retain the water but still had to add about 1/3 cup water every 3 min until the broccoli was cooked. I did use fresh broccoli so frozen might create extra water. It was very good and anyone who prefers more soy sauce added it at the table.",
