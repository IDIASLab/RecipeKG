For my family of four we had plenty to eat the next night.  I made this in my turbo cooker, which only took about 20 minutes.  Even though I cute the recipe in half I still used one can of milk.  I added 1 cup sour cream and garden fresh green papers, because let's face it what is a cheese steak without pappers.  I also used 4 ounces of velveeta cheese instead of cheddar, since I had the velveeta on hand.  I just thought it turned out better than expected.  Definitely a keeper in our home.  Thanks!",
