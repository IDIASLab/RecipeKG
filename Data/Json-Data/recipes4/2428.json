I sauteed the onions and then browned the chops in the same pan w/ the oinions still in it.  Then I braised the chops w/ onions in about a cup of chicken broth for maybe 30 minutes.  I removed the chops and reduced the chicken broth by about half.  Then I added the tomatoes, vinegar and spices.  Topped w/ feta and the house feel silent while we devoured our dinner.  I am going to try this w/ chicken next time.  And then make it again, and again and again!!!",

I lie...I did change it, I also tried it with chicken thighs...every bit as good as the pork. The feta cheese really added zip. Made it for company, they took home the recipe....made it for my married children and spouses...and both daughters have made it at home, and I only found the recipe 3 weeks ago! Just one other thing...I used white balsamic the first time (to keep the colour more pleasing), was very good, however, it had just a little more spunk with the dark version.  For those of you who find pork chops too dry, try pork shoulder steak...I rarely use chops and find the pork steak is always more moist and flavourful.",
