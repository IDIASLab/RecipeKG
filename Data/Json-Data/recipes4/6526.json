You can make it as hot or mild as you like. I use this sandwich as dinner with soup and salad. A very satisfying meal. The amount of blue cheese depends on how messy or not you like your sandwich to be.",

The flavor combination of this sandwich is spot on. They just all blend really well together. I served this with 'Blue Cheese Fried Potatoes' from AR and we enjoyed a very delicious meal.

(The only thing that was different was the flavor of sausage we had \"garlic Gruyere\" chicken sausage.) The sauce was FULL of heat - like make ya sweat and make ya yell \"whoo!\" after each bite. I can't imagine having that much hot sauce on a buffalo flavored sausage. Personally I'd reduce the Tabasco to 2/3 or 1/2 as much to dial back the heat -- but that's just me. Thanks for the tasty easy recipe!",

I'm lucky enough to have a speciality grocery store that makes all different flavors of fresh chicken sausages so I did use fresh buffalo chicken sausages cooked them and kept them whole. Added in the peppers and onions cooked those then added the buffalo sauce and heated through. I actually forgot to use the spinach (and I bought it too lol) so I put the sausage on the toasted bun topped w/ more buffalo sauce ranch dressing the peppers and onions and some crumbled blue cheese. These were so tasty and hubby and the little guy absolutely LOVED them! A great twist on a sausage peppers and onion sandwich. I will def be making these again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
