        "description": "A family favorite. My 71-year-old dad's mother made an old-fashioned cornbread dressing without the modern convenience of cream soup mixes and bagged stuffing mix. She taught my mother, who passed this version on to me. I believe people came to my mom's house for Thanksgiving and Christmas for this one dish!  Everyone asks for the recipe when I bring it along for a holiday potluck, or they tell me how much it reminds them of the old-fashioned dressing their grandmother made.",

My dad hates dressing though which I don't understand. I usually use green onion instead of regular onion. The thing is that I usually cook it for holidays like Easter Christmas and Thanksgiving when the whole family is over at our(our being my mom and dad's) house. My family says that it is missing something though like spice. That was my review how about yours?:):P:O:D",
