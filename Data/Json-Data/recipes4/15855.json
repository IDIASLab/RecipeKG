WHAT I DID: COOKED @ 375 instead of 350 (based off of previous comments) and placed oiled/seasoned hash browns in oven after it was preheated and cooked them ALONE while i cooked the beef and did all the other steps... (about 20-25 mins, depending on how fast you work). While cooking beef i substituted onion powder for actual onions, cut into TINY little pieces (yellow onion) and also added salt and a tad bit of WORCHESTIRE sauce... I also substituted the gravy mix with ACTUAL gravy, because i didnt have the dry stuff.. so just used some beef broth (1 cup), flour, WORCHESTIRE (just a tad, like 1-2 tsp) and butter was my mixture i poured into beef after draining. after that just made it as usual, except I also put a couple tidbits of butter on top of mixture to melt into it and i cooked 20 MINUTES @ 375 then another 5 mins to melt remaining cheese... MMMMMM DELICIOUSSS... MAKE IT YOUR OWN :)",

But with some changes it is one of my favorite weekday meals now.  \n\nAs others mentioned, the cook time is off.  I used a whole 2 pound bag of potatoes (that's enough to nearly fill a 9\" X 13\" baking dish) with olive oil, Italian seasoning, garlic powder and black pepper,  and began cooking it in a 375 degree oven while starting on the hamburger.  Finely dice a medium yellow onion and one or 2 jalapenos to add a little kick- or use a bell pepper if you don't want any heat. Cook with a dab of butter or olive oil until onions start to turn translucent, then add hamburger until brown. Drain grease....\n\nRemove hash browns and add a cup of of Colby/monteray cheese before adding meat.\n\nHere's where I went way off script. I didn't like the brown gravy/water flavor very much.  Instead I used a ranch dip mix packet, 1/3 cup of milk and a cup of sour cream. I combined that with the drained hamburger and spooned over the potatoes and cheese. Bake for another 15 minutes and add a cup (or 2) of Colby/Monterey cheese. Bake that just until melted. \n\nI love green onions so some of those  chopped up made a great addition sprinkled on top!",

First I used pre-cooked hash brown patties which eliminates the flavorless results when baking raw hash browns. No oil & I added 1.5 oz. of real bacon bits to the ground beef mixture. I also crumbled the hash browns & microwaved them in a bowl. Doing that helped bring it to temp without overcooking the hamburger & gravy. I added a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce & a tablespoon of minced onions (no onion powder) to the hamburger after it was done. I only had a 2 cup dry brown gravy packet so I poked a few holes in the hash browns & added 1/4 cup or so to use some of the extra. Much more flavorful!",
