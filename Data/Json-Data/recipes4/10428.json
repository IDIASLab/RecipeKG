I'm from Wisconsin as well...reminds me of all the wonderful church picnics we used to go to when I was a child with the huge pots of chicken booyah and the roasted corn...yummmm!! My mother and grandmother used to make it and this is very similar to what they used to make my grandmother was of Belgian descent. The only thing that's different with this recipe then what I had as a child was the addition of canned pork and beans. I'm sure its probably a \"Wisconsin thing'! I live in Florida now and no one from here has any idea what it is...except of course for some of the 'snow birds'. Thank you again for the trip down memory lane.",
