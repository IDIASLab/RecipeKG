After reading the ingredients and knowing we would like this soup I doubled it for a very large pot. I froze a container for my in-laws and have a container for my parents. The ingredients work well together and could easily be adapted to your family's favorite pizza ingredients. For the first time I made as written with the exception of the dried ravioli. I could not find it so I used dried tortellini. The next time I will use Italian sausage in place of the hamburger and add green peppers. As the soup cooled some of the broth has soaked up in the pasta. I will just added a little additional beef broth when I reheat the leftovers. A wonderful soup that we enjoyed with a hard crusty roll. Thanks Angie for sharing your recipe.",
