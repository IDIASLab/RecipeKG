But the second time around I addded ONE tablespoon of white vinegar to the garlic-oregano paste mixture and that DID IT!  The vinegar added an ever so slight tanginess to the meat which blended wonderfully with the garlic and oregano flavors.  Try it, your taste buds will thank you!",

I added 1 tablespoon of white vinegar (as per my parents' way of cooking it).  I didn't change any of the ingredients but I have a great way of cooking it that I adapted from my parents.  The pork should be cooked 1/2 hour per pound (10 pounds = 5 hours)--Cook with the fat side down in a covered roasting pan for the first half of the cooking time, then uncover and cook with the fat side up for the second half of the cooking time.  It'll turn out moist, very well cooked (which is extremely important when cooking pork!) and the fat side will be nice and crunchy, which, coming from a Puerto Rican family myself is the part that most people covet!!  Enjoy everyone, and THANK YOU for an awesome adaptation of a family staple!!!",

I cut the seasonings in half because of using a smaller cut and used only about 2 teaspoons of salt because the amount called for sounded like too much. I used dried oregano and it was fine. The timing is not clear in the recipe but I found I needed to bake my smaller roast about 2 hrs at 425 then I let it sit covered out of the oven another hour before slicing. I was afraid it wouldn't brown by cooking it covered but it did brown somewhat and yet stayed moist. I'm looking forward to the leftovers for sandwiche tomorrow.",
