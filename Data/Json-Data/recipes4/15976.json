Well most of the time I don't have all the ingredients and all of the time I have to avoid gluten. So I used cheddar-brats and I substituted Progresso Creamy Mushroom Soup (gluten-free) and skipped the extra water (Progresso is not condensed but ready-to-eat). Since I had no real potatoes in the house I made instant mashed potatoes and ladled the soup over it. If it's thick enough my \"I hate soup\" fussy teen assumes it's a casserole. We both liked it and noticed that the thick sauce and mashed potatoes held the heat very well a plus for winter fare. Said fussy teen just asked for another helping!",
