YUMMY!  I have so many more flavors to experiment with!  I did find that I had to bake them a bit longer than the recipe called for, about 11-12 minutes.  Try this one, you won't regret it!",

These were delish! They tasted like little brownies. The only other mod. I used nuts and choc. chips and M&M's to equal 1/2 cup total. These were not sticky at all and were a snap to make economical and very uniform because the dough was beautiful to work with and easily made so with the help of a cookie scoop. I only had an ALDI'S brand mix which is super cheepo and they still were wonderful. Didn't taste like a mix at all. Versatile recipe and so quick and easy not to mention good-tasting.",

Tonight's sweet-tooth attack was handled by a spare box of vanilla cake mix 1/2 cup sweetened coconut 1/4 cup sliced almonds 1 tsp almond extract 1/4 cup oil and a splash of milk.
