Moved to baking dish. Browned one pound of ground beef drained and and moved to baking dish along with a half a small jar of salsa tomato paste and filled the salsa jar with water and added that too. Seasoned with basic stuff and sprinkled cheddar cheese. Put a layer of tatter tots and sprinkled more cheese on top of the tots. Baked for 40 minutes at 350. Would make it again cause I really like it. Would use and full can of salsa and enough water to get the last of the salsa out of the jar",
