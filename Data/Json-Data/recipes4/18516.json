The only changes I made were to saute the onions and jalapeno in bacon grease (this is what my grandmother had always done) I also replaced the  tomato bouillon with chicken bouillon because that is what I had on hand. This tasted so good and were soft, but not already mushy. I  also soaked my beans the night before and into the next day (maybe for like 15 hours total). I have learned in the past that soaking the beans makes a big difference. However, I had never made them before in an instant pot. Next time I may just throw them in without soaking. There was a lot of liquid left, so if you do soak your beans you may not need so much water. This will be how I make a pot of mexican pinto beans from now on! Thank you!",

So here is the update you can try.\n6 Cups of Water\n1lb dry pinto beans\n1tbsp low sodium vegtable base (in the jar)\n1tbsp low sodium chicken base (in the jar)\nincrease all seasonings to 1 tsp instead of 1/2.\nAdded 1 tsp salt since i stoped using boullon\nRest of ingrediants stayed the same.  I do saute the onions in about a tbsp of oil for about 2 minutes in the instapot then add the garlic and jalapeno and saute them until fragrent then add the water to deglaze before adding rest of ingrediants.\n\nWe end up with more bean broth and have beans for dinner and then make refried beans in the morning for bean and cheese tacos :)",
