Even though I didn't over mix the mixture came out dry. I added a little extra PB & that seemed to help. The bars turned out great & were consumed quickly. So today I made the second batch using Sunsweet Chopped Dates. These dates were obviously drier straight from the package (in retrospect probably better suited for wetter mixtures like cookie or muffin batter). I had to compensate with even more PB which threw the overall flavor balance off. Other than using fresh dates (not easy to find where I live I'd love ideas for how to improve the moistness when using packaged dates.",
