My husband is from Israel and grew up eating sambusaks all of his life made by his family, especially his Savta Chana!  When I sent him to one of our Israeli grocery stores here in Dallas, they did not have the frozen ones.  So I found your recipe and it was so easy!  My husband said these are the real deal and very authentic!  The only thing I changed was we didn't have the coriander so that got left out.  Savta Chana also put turmeric in the filling while cooking it so that's what we did.  SO yummy!",
