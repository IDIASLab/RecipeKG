These are delicious, and my new favorite way to feed my husband a better breakfast.",

                "reviewBody": "A good concept but much too 'savory.' Used 3 large eggs and I think I got the texture right for the recipe. It made 1 dozen loosely spooned into cups. You can tell by the recipe that this is not a batter. They were somewhat greasy. I suspect I will try it again because it is a good idea easy and something new for a quick breakfast. Will not add Worcester sauce at all. Did not use garlic and won't use any of the spices listed. Will make more like baby quiches. I think the quinoa will make baby quiches have enough texture and chew to be filling. Will mix 3 eggs and maybe a cup of milk into the quinoa spinach and cheese then put into parchment muffin cups. I'm thinking the bacon didn't do much for it so unless I have some just waiting around bored I'll probably leave that out also. Anyway I still think this is a good idea and could be excellent once adjusted to my tastebuds. This recipe as written is too 'savory' for any time of day especially breakfast. I took pictures and will try to upload them. If it works one photo is before baking and one after.",
