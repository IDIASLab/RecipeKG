Glad that I saved mine.\" The scooped-out squash innards were only told to \"set aside\" but not mix back into the spinach mixture, so I ended up just steaming them in the microwave and mixing them into scrambled eggs for my picky toddler (mild flavor and similar color fooled her.) The end result of the stuffed squash was good, but I think the recipe had too many unnecessary steps for what amounted to what wasn't an extraordinary side.",

Scoop out the seeds and soft pulp until you have a firm hollowed-out shell.  Pulse the seeds and scooped out squash in a food processor.  Depending on the number of squash and family taste preferences, add as much as preferred of a small box of instant seasoned stuffing mix, (about 1 small box/ 4 to 6 servings of squash) following package directions for the proportionate amounts of hot water and butter.  Add a beaten egg (1 for 4 servings), and salt and pepper to taste.  Fill squash shells, cover with their tops, place in a baking dish with 1/2 inch water added, cover and bake at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes or until tender, removing foil cover for last 10-15 minutes.of baking.

I ended up splitting them in half prior to cooking and so a lot of the filling just ran into the pan. Basically it sounds as if I should have \"stuffed\" the one I used and then filled it and split. Might have been overcooked since I boiled it until soft. Did not like them and may have been the mistakes I made or how I cooked them prior to filling.",
