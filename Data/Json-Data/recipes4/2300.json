I also warmed the hazelnut spread for a few seconds in the microwave to make it easier to spread. Total prep time was no more than 10 minutes this way and cooking time was 8-12 minutes (as per directions for crescent rolls). Very fast very easy and great results.",

Lay down one third of your sheet at a time so the others don't get in the way. Don't be concerned about exact measurements: just lengthen and widen the pastry with a few strokes of your pin, keeping it in a general rectangular shape. Don't bother to measure the Nutella, you can eyeball it. Less is more here; you want it to be a hint of flavor, you don't want people to say \"Mmm, Nutella and raspberry jam!\" Spread the Nutella quickly, as it dries out after several strokes and becomes more difficult to spread. It doesn't have to be pretty; nobody can see the inside. If you go all the way to the edge, no worries. The jam measurement seems to be just right for the size pastry. When you fold em up, crimp the edges with a fork; if filling squeezes out, oh well. A few strokes of egg wash along the top and sides. Make sure you use parchment paper as the filling may overflow in the oven and be a huge pain to scrape off the sheet. And voila! Quick, easy, delicious... this pastry will impress, and you don't have to let on how painless it was.",

I was in a huge hurry and wanted smaller/mini pastries so I just cut along the fold lines in the pastry and then divided each of the three strips into four equal squares. I dropped 1 teaspoon of seedless red raspberry jam and 1/2 teaspoon of nutella near the edge of one of the shorter sides and rolled them up tight. Place them seam side down on parchment and pushed them down a little to make sure they stayed rolled up. These are so fast and easy with yummy results. I will use this recipe often.

I think i may put an entire layer of neutella and jam on an entire pastry roll it up chill it for an hour to firm the dough and then cut it into 1/2 rolls. that way you only have two big edges to worry about instead of 9 4 little edges. With less edges you get more filling per bite. Also you can roll it up wrap the rolled dough around to form a breakfast ring seal the two edges and cut vents about half way down so that the servings are easy to separate. lots of potential and what is not great with neutella? will try variations and get back to you. i wonder if neutella raspberry and cream cheese would be good.",
