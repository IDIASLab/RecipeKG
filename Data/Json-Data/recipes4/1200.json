I used orange extract instead of rum. They actually tasted very much like the no alcohol rum balls I am used to having!They are a great way to use up chocolate cake that turned dry. I had made chocolate cupcakes that came out dry and stuck to the pan so there was no way I could use them as cupcakes. This recipe was perfect for using all the crumbled cupcakes! I am so glad I found this recipe instead of wasting all those not so good cupcakes (even though I used the rest in a yummy trifle;) ). I did not give them five star only because they did not really taste like truffles and second they were a bit too soft for my taste. Still a great recipe though!",
