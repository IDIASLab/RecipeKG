I couldn't find Gouda cheese so I bought a 7 oz. package of Feta cheese and a package of shredded Mozzarella cheese. I used the Feta cheese for the first step of paragraph 3. Then I used 1 cup of the shredded Mozzarella for the final step. Very good! Also one suggestion: I stirred the pasta/zucchini combination several times in the colander so as to not let the pasta get rubbery. Thanks for a keeper!!",
