I used butter and olive oil sauteed 3 green onions and garlic for a few mins. added about 3/4c. of half n half some seasoned salt like nature's seasoning and then mashed up 3 whole avacados into this mixture and reduced it a bit. What resulted was a thick creamy (but with good texture) sauce that I poured over toasted sourdough bread with shrimp on top (they were already cooked)grilled asparagus and a salad of mixed greens with pears dried cranberries and poppy seed dressing. A big hit. Take a recipe and make it your own. Use it as a guideline and suit it to you and your family's taste. This idea was exceptional and I will be making this again and again for my family.",
