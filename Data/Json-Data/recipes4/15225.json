I used twice the amount of red pepper b/c I love it added the 2 limes and a couple more splashes of bottled lime juice and that helped too with a balancing amount of cilantro of course. Next time I make this though one thing I would decrease is the amount of red onion too much onion! And I like red onion in general but Serious onion breath here. Even after days of making it the onion seems to stay very fresh. I think I'll take the advice of corn and ground beef w/ the cooked onions. That sounds like a great idea. Thanks!",
