Rest I kept the same.\" I was skeptical of the seemingly strange combo of Cajun seasoning, cumin and cilantro, but somehow this all came together in a really delicious way! To make it an entree, I crisped 1 lb. sliced smoked sauce w/ the onion and garlic, and while the recipe didn't say to drain and rinse the black beans, I did so anyways, and sprinkled w/ fresh chopped cilantro (couple TB's worth) since I don't keep dry on hand. It WAS quick and easy, and better than that, 5 stars from the entire family, and no leftovers!",

I've been on this site for 10+ years and never reviewed a recipe, but since this one had so few reviews and was so good, I thought I'd throw in my $0.02. ;) I had to make a few slight modifications to use what I had on hand, but it was the same basic idea and worked out perfectly! The only onion I had was a small bag of Birdseye frozen chopped onions, so used half a bag for the onion (no need to thaw). I also used minced garlic from a jar (approx 3 tsp). I didn't have Creole seasoning, so used 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1/4+ tsp seasoned salt instead and omitted the cilantro since I didn't have any on hand (I'm sure it would add great flavor, though!). I used Bush's seasoned recipe canned black beans drained, but not rinsed (those are my favorite) and substituted 2 cups of chicken broth for the water and bouillon cube. I cooked it just how the recipe states with the exception of adding all the seasonings before simmering and simmering for approx 45-50 minutes because I used brown rice. It was so easy and tasted fantastic! My VERY picky two year-old loved it and my husband insisted that it go in our regular rotation! Thanks again! ;)",
