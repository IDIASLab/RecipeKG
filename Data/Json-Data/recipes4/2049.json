I cut both the olive oil and vinegar in half, and it was more than enough to cover my 1 pound-plus salmon filet.  You don't need that much oil/vinegar.  I also only used 3 garlic cloves, because I was serving something else garlicky.  I didn't have any cilantro, so I tripled the basil.  And finally, I only sprinkled on a little garlic salt, it would have been way too salty with all of it.  Went well with Calabrese Style Spaghetti (from this site) and fresh corn on the cob.",

I left out the garlic salt, just going with the fresh garlic rub, as I didn't see the need for it. The marinade went over salmon steaks which we placed on the bbq, herb side up, turning after 10 minutes and cooking for a total of 15. Absolutely divine. Amazing flavor.",

Just the fact that it takes less than half an hour to make is wonderful, but the results are very tasty, which is extra wonderful!

I would add LESS olive oil next time... it was a little too much! 15 minutes would have been way too long for my salmon (it was more like 11-12 min), but maybe my fillets were smaller than the recipe called for. My husband was very happy with this and so was my daughter. Thanks for the fast and yummy recipe, Ariel!",
