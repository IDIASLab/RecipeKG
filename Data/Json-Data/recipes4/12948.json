It doesn't sound very romantic, but this recipe is  much fancier and delicious than your mother's meatloaf. Luckily for me, he was impressed. Serve this meatloaf with mashed potatoes.  The juice from the meatloaf will act as a gravy.  Since the recipe makes 2 loaves, you can freeze one or deliver the wrapped loaf to a neighbor with cooking instructions attached and a bottle of red wine.",

I decided to make according to recipe only making a layer in the middle with the provolone and prosciutto and mixing the spinach in with the meatloaf mixture. My broiler pan is quite shallow so I was only able to use a cup each of the wine/water. This was very good. I liked the subtlety of the wine and the flavors of the meatloaf with the prosciutto provolone and spinach. I think it could use some garlic onion and perhaps some spices....rosemary maybe? I'd like to make this again with little additions to see if it would make it really out of sight. I could see how this would make a great meatball tossed with a parmesan-garlic whole wheat pasta. I didn't want to make changes if I hadn't tried it as is first. I DID use fresh low carb bread to make my bread crumbs. My husband was adamant that I make \"tots\" with this as he's a boy. If he had not suggested that I would have served a light pasta/rice/potato dish. I had mine with garlic broccoli and that was sufficient enough for me the low-carber. NOTE: I found the prosciutto and provolone at a cheaper price at my local Grocery Outlet. You CAN find them at a cheaper price I've done it!",

I made this for my boyfriend of a month for the first time and he asks for this all the time. It has a great mix of flavors and is very easy. I do use four slices of cheese on each loaf and that adds to the overall amazingness but even if you follow the recipe to the letter it still is well worth your while to try it! Additional comment 10/09: My husband (boyfriend mentioned above) still asks for this all the time - and raves about it to other people making them want to try it too. I think that of everything I cook this is his most requested meal. Nowadays I saute the spinach instead of wilting it. I saute that spinach with leeks and it is wonderful! I also double the cheese (SUPER healthy!) so that each bite is oozing with the cheese.",
