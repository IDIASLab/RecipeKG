I added more vinegar and oil added oregano salt pepper... and still it lacked something... I added feta cheese... still lacked something. Maybe a little lemon juice and flat leave parsley or basil. I didn't add the pickle b/c I didn't have it and I didn't see it fitting into the mediterranean concept. Was the pickle the secret ingredient? Over all not bad experience but not super either.",
