                "reviewBody": "This is a creative spin on trout, without question!! An excellent pairing trout/wasabi!! So, I prepared it first to the letter. (Really respected the original recipe for its creativity) And it was really good, but any Asian inspired fish recipe without ginger is lacking something, in my opinion. The recipe was good just not memorable.  Found out trout really is an excellent fish to accompany wasabi! It's mild flavor lends itself well, and does not need a full-blown teriyaki or overpowering marinade. The second time I adjusted by adding a tsp of ginger, substituting sesame oil for olive oil, added 4 teaspoons of brown sugar and finally swapping parsley for oregano! Lastly, as other reviewer's recommended I added additional wasabi. Give it a try, but I really believe it needs the ginger at the very least and brown sugar binds the sauce adding a shimmer and is well suited as a glaze. The extra wasabi should be added, per your own taste and sesame oil is kind of a no-brainer being that it is an Asian inspired recipe.",
