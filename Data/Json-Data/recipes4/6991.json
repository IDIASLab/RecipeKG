I did brine my chops for a few hours before BBQing them.  The sauce is very mild and very delicious!  Thanks for a very delicious pork chop that will be repeated in the future.  Afterthought:  I was thinking about this sauce in the middle of the night. I think next time I'll crush rather than mince my garlic, and I'll mix up the sauce several hours ahead of time so the flavors really have more of a chance to meld.",
