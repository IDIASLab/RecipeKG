I also used low-sodium V8 because that's what we had in the house.  I would highly recommend using a better pepperoni (like Kretschmar or Boars Head) that you can get at the deli.  They have a truer pepperoni taste and aren't quite as salty.  Will make this one again, especially for a night that I need to put together a meal quickly.",
