Family members and friends of the family made these cabbage pockets, sometimes called Krautbrot or Bierocks. This is a perfect food for lunches, as it is self contained and freezes well. I have changed it slightly to make it easier to make and enjoy. I love mine served hot, with ketchup for dipping!",

I mixed together 1 lb of ground chorizo 1 lb ground turkey 1 lb ground beef and cooked the mix slowly with no added oils or butter or anything in a large cast iron skillet while I attended to the prep of the vegies. when the meat was almost done I added two tsp of fresh ground black pepper and 1 tsp cayenne pepper and four tbsp of dried minced onion and worked it into the meat. After the meat was done cooking I drained it in a colander then added it to the corned beef hash (I picked up a can of this on purpose for t his dish) waiting in a mixing bowl where I mixed them all thoroughly. no need to add salt to this dish.. Vegie mix tossed in and mixed in as thoroughly as possible. 1 can of grands buttermilk biscuits I manually spread out each one at a time as far as I could without rendering them useless then spread a couple small slices of gouda tbsp shredded medium cheddar tbsp shredded mozzarella then two tbsp of the filling on top of that pressed down firmly to encourage it to stay then a tsp of alfredo sauce over that then I folded the biscuit down and pulled the lower part up and overlapped in the middle. the sides I pulled up and pressed to the top of the package....",
