Also I squeezed some fresh lemon juice over top when I seasoned my portion since I can't get enough of acidic foods then ate the lemon while I ate the Quinoa. Most people probably would find that unappetizing but I could eat lemons for days. Definitely making this again. I think I'll use a smaller garlic clove. I used a large one and it was a bit too much.",
