Saw that another reviewer added some Worstershire sauce and that is a brilliant idea. I also think paprika or some chopped mushrooms might be a good addition depending on your tastes. Pretty easy to make and would be very easy to cut in half or portion out for meal-planning if you're cooking for one like I am. Another time I will cook one squash only and freeze half the stuffing for another week. (I used a smoked andouille sausage and it was delicious.)",
