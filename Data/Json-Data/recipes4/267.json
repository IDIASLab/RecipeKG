Also, you should experiment with a variety of vegetables. If your meat or veggies come out a too dry, try using meat with higher fat percentage or add a few drops of water before cooking next time. Lastly, for those who think this recipe is a bit bland, I've always put a bouillon cube in for some flavor. Good luck. ",
