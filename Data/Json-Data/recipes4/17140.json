If you are experienced with baking, you will understand that you have to add your water slowly. Your climate affects how much water goes in to dough. For example, I needed to add a bit extra, but I don\u2019t fault the recipe. Also, as for it burning when you bake it, maybe your oven runs hotter or maybe you rolled your dough thinner than the OP, although it seems like it would be difficult to burn anything at 250 degrees. It\u2019s always best to check a few minutes early.\nJust saying, this is your basic salt dough and it is a perfectly fine recipe. Thank you OP",

I feel it is WELL worth noting somewhere in the recipe that although this is great project for families, etc - these cookies are SUPER toxic to dogs!!  After leaving my failures on the counter in a hurry I came home to a dog who was drinking excessively & getting sick.  After googling \"dog poisoning and salt dough\" I had NUMEROUS results of families who were not as lucky as I and the treatment can be somewhat extreme if the dog is small and ingested a lot of salt.  I was fortunate my dog is not small, had access to plenty of water and rid her stomach of most of it's contents or it could have been very bad.  \n\nPlease consider adding this warning to the recipe - I don't want to deter anyone from making them - just feel they should know to keep away from dog's reach - even when hung on the tree.  Thank you!",
