                "reviewBody": "I haven't made this recipe but the flaw I believe is in using a pressure cooker to speed up time. The best beef bone stock I have made was with 4 marrow bones simmering in a Crock pot for 4 days. I had to add water three times to top up. It was jello deep red brown and 1 tablespoon to a pot of rice added big flavour. the bones crumbled and i strained by the end of it. If you switch to a Crock-Pot and follow this recipe cooking for 1 day minimum at low heat (use high heat to get pot to a simmer then turn to low) this recipe will be top notch. to avoid cooking out all of the nutrients in the vegetables I recommend adding 2-4 hours to stock before you plan to cool it down.",

To no fault of the submitter there probably wasn't enough beef on the bones. I will try this again using beefier bones with the hopes of raising this to 5 stars. This has a lot of potential. Stay tuned.",
