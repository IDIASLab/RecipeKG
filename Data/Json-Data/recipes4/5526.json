I used 3 Tablespoons of grapeseed oil instead of the butter (a little healthier) and cooked the onion, diced carrots in the oil on medium low heat - I used 4 stalks of celery - add the celery to the onions and carrots and cooked for a couple of minutes.  Add the flour, salt and pepper - stir to form a roux and then added about a cup of chicken broth, stir until it started to thicken and then added just a splash or two of milk - cook until thickened (adjust thickness after the sauce has come to a boil)  I then stirred in the peas (I used more peas as I had a half a bag in the freezer) and the cubed, cooked chicken.  Stir to combine.  I want a thick mixture to fill the pie crust.  You can add any vegetables you have on hand.  If you have leftover cooked vegetables add them with the chicken.  I used a basic short crust pastry recipe.  The bottom crust will not be soggy if your chicken mixture is thick enough.  If you want to cut out a few more calories use just a top crust.",

I normally use low fat or fat free milk anyway and the minimum amount of butter so that was in line with what's suggested here. However, it's much lower in fat and calories if you get rid of some of the pie crust. I had leftover chicken so boiled the veggies in the broth; reserved the broth; added 2T butter to the veggies, stirred in the flour, and then slowly incorporated the milk; returned the broth to the pot. When this thickened, I added the chicken and peas. I poured into two 4 x 7 baking dishes and used about 3/4 of a pie crust cut into rectangles to cover. (I saved the extra scraps for another use.) This was 4 hearty servings. By making those small changes, this calculated at about 416 calories and 17g fat at 4 servings or 208 cal and 8.5g fat for 8 (as written). Healthier is subjective, but I would prefer to have more substance and less wrapping for something like this.",
