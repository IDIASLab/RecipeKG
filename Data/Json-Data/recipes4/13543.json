I typically make a broth out of whole chicken (and much more Western aromatics) once or twice a week for whatever I need stock for that week. Now if you could just post up a recipe for that yellow curry sauce (often served with chicken and potato) my life would be complete!",

Ever since I've CRAVED this broth, and have tried so many methods of re-creating it.  This broth is IT.  And I would say is even better, since it has tons of flavor without tons of sodium.  It tastes fresh, light, and warming. The recipe as written is 5 stars, but over time I have tweaked to my preference.  It's an excellent broth and was a perfect starting point to customize to my tastes.  I don't think I've ever written a recipe review before, but I'm so grateful to have found this one. The flavor combination is unparalleled.  Thank you!!",
