'Added those after everybody else was cooked.  Ha.  'Took the suggestion of adding pasta - 1/4# bowties.  I layered, but don't think I will next time.

I tried this recipe last night with a few modifications because of what I had on hand. I used 1 lb. ground beef 1/2 lb. sausage in place of the pork and 1 jar spaghetti sauce in place of the tomatoes and added some red pepper flakes. The flavor and texture were both really good! The only thing I didn't like was the crumb topping. Way to powdery in the mouth. I scraped it all off before saving the leftovers but on that note - it reheats perfectly! Next time I'll reduce the crumbs to 1/2C. but still use all the cheese. Overall I'll make this one again!",
