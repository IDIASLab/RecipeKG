And I didn't peel the eggplant I left the skin on. Also soaked it for a little bit first. I made a ricotta cheese mixture that I do for lasagna which is ricotta egg Italian Medley seasoning and shredded mozzarella...I mix it all together before spreading it on the eggplant. I think next time I'll add garlic powder to the bread crumbs and spinach to the ricotta mixture. I also want to broil it instead of fry it next time. Of course I use LOTS of shredded cheese on top! It was yummy! I'll be making this for my daughters 3rd B-day party in December rather than paying 35 for half tray for it from my local deli (but theirs is really good too). Thanks for sharing!!!",

First I breaded the eggplant using panko bread crumbs and italian seasoning. Then I broiled it instead of frying. It took about 5 minutes on each side (or until brown/crispy). Then I used low fat ricotta (which cuts the fat significantly). I did add some italian seasoning and about a 1/4 cup each of parmesan and asiago cheese to the ricotta for extra flavor (this added some fat but increased the flavor- of course could leave it out also). I substituted fresh spinach for the prosciutto and instead of using jar sauce I made up a quick sauce with just organic diced (for texture) and crushed tomatoes lots of garlic and basil salt pepper to taste. Let it simmer while I was preparing the eggplant (about 30 minutes). The result was perfect. The eggplant retained it's form and didn't get mushy (one of my gripes about eggplant parmesan) and the flavors were wow! Enjoy!",

I sweated it out with salt as suggested, added spinach, garlic S&P and nutmeg to the ricotta, had to make my own breadcrumbs and pasta sauce because i ran out.  Kind of labor intensive though, not a great recipe for a weeknite without all the ingredients on hand premade. Probably took 1.5 hrs total for making 7 rolls.  and you use more than 2 tbspn of EVOO to fry.  Leftovers were good as well. had w/ brown rice. would make again for a weekend meal",
