I had absolutely NO problem with it staying in the pan - and my pan was a 9x5(I even measured). Just in case I placed a cookie sheet on the rack underneath. By the way...that's a good thing to do when trying a new recipe. That way if it does spill over you just have the cookie sheet to clean. I ended up letting it bake for a few extra minutes(I was feeding a baby) but it still was fine. I didn't quite use a whole 1/4th cup poppy seeds but I used an entire 0.8oz container - almost 1/4th cup. As for the coconut cream pudding mix I don't think you HAVE to use it(as another reveiwer put it..). Maybe it adds a bit of a different flavor...or compliments the orange...at any rate of you don't want to use coconut use vanilla! Not that big of a deal! Anywho...as I said this bread is wonderful! All it needs is a powdered sugar icing drizzle and yuuuuuuuuuuummm!!!",
