Serving The McCuddy in a large glass helps vetilate the fumes from the whiskey. This drink gives a strong awake and tastes delicious. I used soy milk for milk intolerance and it stood up well to the Scotch. This is not a drink for the faint of heart. My husband said \"If you drink ten of these you won't be drunk you'll be Scottish!\"",
