The only changes made were very minor. I pre-diced the chicken before pan frying just to eliminate the cool down time before I could safely handle the cooked chicken. I also used a 9x13x2 inch baking pan as it didn't look like it would all fit into the specified pan. AND just to make it more colorful I used the tri-colored pasta and used red and orange peppers instead of the green pepper which my family does not like. This would make a lovely presentation for guests and I will be making this again.",
