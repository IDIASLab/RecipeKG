I sub'd 2 dashes of white pepper for the black pepper and 3 dashes of Montreal Chicken seasoning for the Montreal Steak one and since I had no cornstarch I added 1/2 cup of potato flakes at the end of the cooking time not ideal but workable. I omitted the Italian seasoning but that was an accident I just plain forgot to add it. I usually go light on seasonings just due to personal preference. I used frozen broccoli florets because that is what I had. I really liked the end result and I realized this is a very flexible recipe which I appreciate. Next time I will try it with cream of mushroom beef stock and mushrooms for a more earthy flavor. I think saut\u00e9ing the veggies together added more depth to the flavors so I think the mushrooms on the variation will be really good. Thanks to the person who posted this.",
