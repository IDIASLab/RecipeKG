I used two red bell peppers and omitted the green (we just don't care for them) I used the last two organic red potatoes I had on hand (that I parboiled quickly--as I just stink at hashbrown potatoes when the potatoes are raw) and because I had extra vegetables I needed to use I also added in fresh minced garlic chopped onion sliced mushrooms and right before adding the eggs chopped tomato. Right before serving I sprinkled the skillet with sharp white cheddar. Very cheap to make and I was able to stretch my skillet to feed four extra hungry people and make it a little healthier to boot. GREAT brinner side. I topped mine with a little homemade salsa. VERY very filling. I am quite thankful for this recipe as it really saved my behind today.",
