And my father was to happy to hear how well it came out as he always seemed to think it was a little to tricky for him! Suggestion for those making this dish without the special spaetzle seive: Spoon the dough into an extra strength freezer bag and cut the tip off one corner. (xtra strong because all that squeezing of dough will break the back and you will have dumpling spaetzle. It's also nice to have extra dough to spare because I always seem to make quite a mess. I'm going to double the recipe next time! Also make sure you have some larger sized onions and caramelize them WELL. Chedder cheese worked great as a substitue and I think i omited the vinegar too. Experiment with your spaetzle.. it may become a favorite dish! My father would serve it instead of mashed potatoes and we would cover it with gravy!",

I love spaetzle and make it certainly more frequently than the average American but I've always made it with pork roast and served with gravy. This is an excellent change of pace. If you like spaetzle invest in a spaetzle maker. Mine looks like an extra large potato ricer and has a variety of plates to choose from to vary the size of the spaetzle. It's so easy I use it when I make chicken or turkey soup. Rather than buying noodles I make spaetzle and squeeze into the soup when everything else is done cooking. I made this recipe for supper last night. Followed the recipe exactly except I grated fresh nutmeg and fresh pepper across each layer before I added the cheese. I used a bag of shredded swiss cheese since I didn't want to spend 9 on cheese when I wasn't sure if we'd like the recipe. I'm sure it would be even more delicious if you bought better quality cheese. My bag of cheese had 2 cups in it and that worked out fine although if you really want cheesy go for the whole amount. The onions on the top are so delicious. My husband asked if I added French onion soup mix. (I did not.) He said it reminded him of French onion soup. I did cook the onions in butter rather than oil. It only took 3 Tbsp. of butter. I also forgot to add the vinegar but that was okay. The thing that really made this meal was what I served with it. I made a simple salad with cucumber cherry tomatoes and red onion",

However I had a difficult time making it. I don't have a spaetzle maker so I used a colander with course holes. The dough was too thick (or maybe my colander holes were too thin) and did not drop into the water as it should have. I ended up dropping the dough into the water with a spoon. While the pasta did not look as it should have it didn't seem to greatly affect the rest of the meal preparation. I also found that the pasta preparation was a bit labor intensive. This might not be a problem for some cooks but with three young children crawling up my legs I wasn't able to give my full attention to making the dish as I should have. If I attempt this meal in the future I might try to cook all the pasta at the same time and then drain the pot so I don't have to remove the pasta with a spoon and to save time. However as I said earlier this is a delicious meal that I highly recommend especially for cooks who like to try new and different dishes.",
