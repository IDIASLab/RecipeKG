The mayonnaise covered the pimentos and made them white so I added some to the dish before serving to have the added color-pop. Served this with grill fish grilled pork tenderloin and 'Delicious and Easy Corn on the Cob' from AR. To the leftovers I added diced celery and dry roasted peanuts. For us that gave the recipe the boost we were looking for. (My 3-star review was on recipe as listed not with my add-ins.)",

My experience with thawed frozen peas as the main ingredient in a salad (peas and peanuts which hasn't been published here yet) is that they have a crisper texture but don't take flavor well unless it's bold (like the garlic and Worcestershire sauce in my peas and peanuts). I'm sorry Molly didn't like it more but the use of thawed frozen peas likely didn't do it any favors.",

I certainly didn't think I'd like canned peas (gag) but I followed a reviewer's advice and stuck with the recipe. I used Le Sueur Baby peas and I made it a day in advance as directed (And very handy for a party!) Alas I did not receive the cheese cubes I had ordered so I did make a slight change. In lieu of pimento peppers and cubed cheese I used the tub of pimento cheese spread I had. I was jalepeno flavored so I'm sure my pea dish had a little more kick but I think it was still in line with what the cook here was making. I used less than one cup mayo since the spread already had mayo. Probably 3 TB. It was very tasty and I will make it again and again. I've since been asked for this recipe. Thanks for sharing. I never ever would have thought I'd like canned peas!",
