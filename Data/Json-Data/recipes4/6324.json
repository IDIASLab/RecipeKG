I used water on my finger to moisten edge and pinch shut. This is essential to seal them. That being said I only had a tiny filling to leak out. I felt they needed a dipping sauce made one out if about 3/4 cup sour cream heaping T of ranch dip (not dressing) and a few good shakes of red hot sauce. Perfectly accompanied these gems. Not one leftover! Be aware they become less crispy the longer they sit and cool. Awesome recipe! Family raved! Thanks!",
