After eating one each we decided we would like the tortilla a little crisper and threw them under the broiler for a few minutes. They were delicious. I made a few minor changes due to the ingredients I had on hand - dried cilantro medium cheddar and whole wheat wraps. This will be in our regular rotation - finally a dish everyone likes - and it was so quick and easy too! Update: We make this dish often but to make it even healthier we substitute brown rice for the tater tots.",
