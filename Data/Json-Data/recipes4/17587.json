Ok it's not a hot dog, but it's flavorful and salty and once it's in a bun with ketchup, it is close enough! It at least let me participate in the ritual of a summer cookout and I didn't feel left out of the fun! It's seriously good enough that I want to make it even when I'm off the eating restrictions. I'm telling everyone about this awesome recipe! Thanks!",

We weren't looking for completely healthy but better than our regular recipes. One thing we like and many in this group like is cocktail sausages in a sweet and sour sauce. I found this recipe for Carrot Hot Dogs and was inspired. I came up with something I thought turned out well and was very well received. Instead of large carrots I used baby carrots and steamed them 3 minutes less. I mixed jelly (tried both grape and red current and both are good) with chili sauce (found in the condiment section next to catsup). I used 3 parts jelly to 2 parts chili sauce heated until the jelly melted and poured over the \"cocktail sausages\" in the crock pot. The carrots do cook more in the sauce and have the potential to become mushy. These are so good before the sauce and they're good with the sauce. One of the women told me she tried the sausages following the recipe then wrapped them in bacon and baked in a hot oven until the bacon was crisp. I haven't tried that yet but plan to. This hot dog recipe is very good and versatile!",
