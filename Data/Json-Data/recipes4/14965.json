Except these are crunchy on the outside and savoury. Nice at room temp but super-delish fresh out of the oven. I was a little hasty when rolling them so they aren't as smooth as some of the other pics but I am sure that made no impact on taste! Would definitely make again. BTW I halved the recipe and made 12 rolls. And HINT: if you can't find tapioca flour/starch (same thing) try the international/ethnic especially East Asian section in the market.",
