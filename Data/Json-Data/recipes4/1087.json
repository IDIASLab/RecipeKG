The only things I did different were to use a sliced onion instead of the whole onions. I also browned the onion and the rabbit pieces in the bacon drippings. I thickened the sauce with low carb thickener. Next time I might add a tablespoon or so of low carb orange marmalade to get that orange flavor. Great recipe!",
