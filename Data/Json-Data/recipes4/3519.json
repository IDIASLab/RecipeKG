After reading the reviews I decided to adjust a few things in order to give it more flavor....after draining the pasta I returned it to the pot and tossed with a fairly generous amount of good olive oil....I then added the roasted tomatoes/green onions together with some of the leftover oil garlic that was on the roasting pan. I let the pasta sit for about 10 min before adding the cheese as I didn't want the cheese to entirely melt...I wanted pieces of the cheese still intact. Then I added parsley toasted pumpkin seeds salt and pepper. Loved it!",
