I was a little gun shy using all smoked paprika and had briefly considered playing it on the \u201csafe\u201d side by using it half and half with sweet paprika.  I thought about substituting wine or broth for the water.  I entertained the idea of adding mushrooms.  In the end, however, I decided against all those changes I thought might make this \u201cbetter\u201d and in so doing we had a 5-star dinner resulting in clean plates and no leftovers.  The meat is fork tender and the beautiful gravy thick, rich and boldly flavored.  Different paprika, broth or wine rather than water, additions such as mushrooms \u2013 all unnecessary.  There was enough depth and character to the dish with the onions, tomato paste and, of course, the smoky paprika.  An absolutely delicious and satisfying cold weather dish with good old-fashioned charm.",

In place of the water I used low sodium beef broth which was even more of reason to keep the salt to a minimum. One large vidalia onion was plenty of onion for this dish. My last modification was that I used sweet Hungarian paprika in place of the smoked as my store was fresh out of smoked paprika. I always use sweet Hungarian paprika in all my goulashes and paprikash type dishes anyway although I would love to try this with the smoked next time. I served this over egg noodles with a spoon full of sour cream on each dish. I used a large saute pan and was able to brown all my paprika covered meat at the same time however I only used 2 lbs so that is probably why. Do try this it is great!!",

                "reviewBody": "This was one of the best crockpot dishes I've ever had the pleasure of making as well as eating! After reading several reviews I did alter the recipe quite a bit. First off my supermarket had a special on pork stew meat so I ended up using three pounds of that. I couldn't find smoked paprika anywhere so I ended up using regular. I also used a rub from \"Grill Masters\" which was called \"Sweet and Smoky Rub\" which tasted phenominal! It did have smoked paprika as well as a hint of cinnamon and also chitpolte powder. I also cut down the onion to one large one and added two red peppers because I've heard paprikash should always contain red peppers! I also used one package of fresh baby Portabella mushrooms. I also added one can of chopped tomatoes as well as the tomato paste. I did cook it for about 5 hours on low yesterday and when it was cool I refrigerated overnight. Tonight I threw it back in the crockpot for about three hours on low and I did serve it over egg noodles. I had some dinner guests this evening and they could not stop talking about how wonderful it was! I would definately make it to serve the next day as the taste and the texture of the meat was meltingly tender. All in all....an awesome recipe!",
