I very wearly tried this recipe...\nMy kids, 6 and 4, bounded through the door asking what smelled so good!  After the first bite they LOVED it... and they HATE my regular chili!\nMy husband did raise his eyebrows a bit after the first bite, I think he will be sticking to my original recipe, but I loved this one and my kids have already asked for it again!\nI did increase the water as I may have added a bit to much peanut butter... it was really thick.  I also added a bit more chili pepper, and half a can of diced tomatoes with green chili's to give it a little more kick.  It is better the second day... I had leftovers for lunch.\nTry it... especially if you need to through something together really quick!\n",

It bugs me to read a recipe review wherein the dish has had so many revisions and changes right out of the box that it bears no resemblance to the original intent. How is one to determine whether to give it a try or not? I do realize, though,  that taste is a personal thing. And after taste-testing this chili made to the formula, I thought it might suit me better with a few mods of my own. \n\nI tripled the chili powder to 1 tablespoon, added 1/2 tsp cumin, and a pinch each of cinnamon and allspice. For a little more acid, to brighten the flavor just a bit, and some extra spice as well, I added a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes. It was still just a little thicker than I prefer, so in went 1/4 cup or so of vegetable stock (in keeping with the vegetarian label, though I'm no vegetarian). In my opinion, my initial 3 stars went to 4 stars. I'm still wondering about the 3 garlic cloves AND ALSO garlic powder. Next time I'd probably just mince another couple of cloves. \n\nQuick and easy, inexpensive and filling! Tastes good, too!",

I feel like I wasted bay leaves...and garlic cloves. I should've just used a lot of garlic powder. The reason I'm giving this 5 stars is because my peanut butter loving husband loved it. I cook to make him happy, and this chili did it. I'd give it four stars, but the name clearly states \"Peanut Butter Chili\". So, if you're a big fan of peanut butter, you have to try this. The second day tasted better, more spicy, and we finished it, so the comments about leftovers tasting better are true!",
