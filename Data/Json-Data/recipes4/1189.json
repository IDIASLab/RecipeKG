I actually marinated the chicken in a duck sauce (no marinara so I subbed more duck) and pineapple (no grapefruit either!) juice mixture then baked the entire thing without using the bread crumbs due to other commenters' posts about mushiness. I mixed the spices and sprinkled them on top then used mango (no nectarines!) around the sides. Definitely moist and scrumptious! Only thing I'll change is to halve the pepper next time but otherwise totally FIVE STARS! Made with a steamed cauliflower/broccoli mix and some cheesy broccoli rice for something bland-ish to go with the spicy chicken. Amazing!",
