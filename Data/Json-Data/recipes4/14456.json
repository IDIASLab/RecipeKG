I think I'd like some veggies in this thing but I don't know if torta's usually do so for all I know they are all heavy. The pastry is very easy but it does turn out pretty sticky so be prepared to use a lot of flour when rolling out. The directions are on target and mine was done in the time frame. I really am not a fan of the eggs in this though. They look pretty but they taste dry to me so I'd leave them out next time. This is definitely a dish you want to serve with something light like a salad as one slice is definitely plenty. Bf loved this--probably bc of all the meat in it! Thanks for the recipe.",

I needed to search as the original recipe became wet and oh well you know water and ink are;-) Though this recipe isn't exactly like the one I had I was able to substitute the ingredients. I like using low fat to fat free ricotta and mozzarella. I also added fresh tomatoes spinach lean turkey sausage and I did use prosciutto thinly sliced salami. You really can substitute ingredients for lower fat sodium etc. even use egg whites instead of whole eggs. It comes out a much lighter dish and not heavy at all and very delicious. It has pleased many I have served it too.",

I've seen worse but more Italian ingredient might help, like roasted eggplant, roasted red pepper, roasted Portabello mushrooms and saut\u00e9ed spinach  ... and lose the eggs. I like to use smoked salmon it in as well.",
