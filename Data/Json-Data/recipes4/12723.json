Only other change I made was adding less salt.\n\nNext time I think I'll try to skip the step of grinding everything up in the blender to save on clean up. I'll just chop everything fine and see how it goes. It was very good as is, and I think it will also be very good making changes each time I cook it - add more curry powder one time - maybe add thai basil one time....\n\nThanks!",

I had never used fish sauce before so that was kind of scary; but the finished produce did not taste \"fishy\" at all. Hubby didn't love it but he didn't hate it either. He said it was different. Note: he was basically making it with my help and he was okay until we added the fish sauce! LOL! I served it with basmati rice and peas. I will probably make it again.",
