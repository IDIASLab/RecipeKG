I just felt like there was something missing from the sauce but not sure what. I used chicken tenders and had no whole wheat bread so I just put some of my homestyle bread in my mini chopper to make the bread crumbs. Next time I'll probably put the chicken under the broiler at the very end just briefly as I would have liked a little crisper breading. However it was plenty moist we liked it and I will make this one again.",
