I first had these at a neighborhood breakfast, and my neighbor added fresh onions and veggies, but this is great for making on nights when there isn't much in the fridge! Honey ham is good in these, as well. They can be served hot or cold and are great as reheated leftovers.",

I only used 1 slice of cheese finely diced and it was plenty.   A couple of tips - I filled the muffin cups to just about the top and they puffed up nicely without overflowing.  I would suggest removing them or at least loosening them up almost immediately after being removed from the oven.  I waited a bit too long (to take a picture) and they were starting to stick.  A plastic teaspoon lifted them out without scratching the pan.",
