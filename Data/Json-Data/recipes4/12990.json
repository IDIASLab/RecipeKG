I made it for my Bunco group, since the dinner theme was \"Easter Brunch.\"  I doubled the recipe for 12 women, and it was almost all gone!  I used apricot nectar instead of apricot-mango (my mistake, but it was still good).  I also made a frozen ring in a bundt pan out of strawberries, pineapple and oj.  Be sure to stir the punch after you add the champage, so that the flavors meld.  Everyone said it had a nice flavor and wasn't too strong.",
