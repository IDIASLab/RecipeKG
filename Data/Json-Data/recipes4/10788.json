I followed the recipe exactly but it looked unappetizing (there was a thick white scum on the top of the broth plus the lamb looked fatty and grey) and I disliked the smell too. Then I added some fresh thyme and rosemary and I still didn't much like the taste. I'm going to keep the lamb broth (I spooned the ickiness off) and freeze it for something else. I hate giving bad reviews but this really didn't work for us. So sorry.... But glad others enjoyed it!",

This is simply easy and tasty though I do saute the onions first; do add lots of freshly ground black/other pepper whilst cooking - adds body thus it won't be bland. Love it just this way (with the black pepper) with bread to soak it the gravy or one can alway play around with such a good base recipe like this to suit personal preferences.",
