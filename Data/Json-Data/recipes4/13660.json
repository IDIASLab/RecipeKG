After making this several times since writing the recipe I've found that: I like chicken flavored vegetable broth by Orrington Farms the best; it's ok to use minced garlic from a jar; add 1/2 cup more celery; add herbs/spices before boiling; decrease water to 10 cups; increase noodles to 3 cups (I like the dumpling style noodles); and decrease cooking time to 20-30 minutes. The cornstarch/water mixture is optional. Oh you may need to add salt to taste depending on the sodium content of your broth. And this is probably more like 6-8 servings.:)",

Keep the broth at 12 cups if you use egg noodles. I reduced the broth to 8 cups and those noodles soaked it right up. after two bowls there wasn't any broth left! Thanks for a good recipe. I will make it with my own vegetable stock next time to reduce the sodium and keep it at 12 cups.",

I used the dumpling noodles which I love anyway and used vegetable broth because I couldn't find the kind called for in the recipe. I added more salt because my broth didn't have a whole lot. As for the other seasonings I really only used the poultry seasoning and black pepper (and a bit of thyme.) I also added peas because I thought they looked pretty. And one more change - I sauteed the tofu with the veggies for just a bit to give it some flavor. My husband usually HATES celery so I left it big enough for him to pick out but he wound up liking it. I didn't have to use the cornstarch mixture but I could see how it would be a nice thickening agent if your soup was thin. I will most certainly be making this recipe again and again this fall and winter especially since I keep most of the ingredients on hand. A soup that's this easy is always nice to have in the arsenal. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!",
