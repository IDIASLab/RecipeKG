I made the recipe as published with plenty of salt and white pepper to taste and did add some crab meat to the filling. I added about 10 minutes baking time on. Make sure you use a large baking dish for this my 9 x 13 only held 8 enchiladas so I ended up using two and having to eye the sauce. Oh and make sure you butter or Pam the dish mine stuck a bit. Overall it's a lot of prep and a time consuming recipe but the result is soooooo worth it! Thanks for sharing your recipe bajathecat!",

In spite of the Anaheim and the jalapeno, there was very little heat in this recipe, and I was thankful for that, because I didn't want to lose the delicate flavor of the seafood!  I used shrimp and crab meat, following the recipe exactly until the last garnish of tomato and green onion, because I was serving a salsa along with the enchiladas.  Beautiful cheese sauce, but very rich!  I used a 13 x 9 pan, and the recipe made 10 enchiladas for me.  I took Saveur's advice and sprayed the pan with cooking spray before baking.  This dish is company worthy!  Thanks!",

I did use a 10X15 casserole dish. My cheese mixture seemed a bit soupy and that may have been due to my extra peppers but it thickened up just perfect in cooking. I forgot about the foil but it didn't burn and so I really didn't need it. Topped with the extra tomatoes green onions and cilantro. Great dish for using up garden peppers everyone loved it. Not even as rich as I thought it would be but then again I had lots of veggies in this. Certainly will make this enchilada casserole again you can use just about any seafood and not go wrong...and don't be shy on the vegetables just use a large baking dish.",

Even though I added more seasoning and garlic to the sauce it was pretty bland. It needed more cheese and a more flavorful cheese at that. I did add some parmesan but it needed much more. The tortillas got soggy which I was afraid of happening. Probably would do better not to cover them with foil while baking. The seafood and sauce would have been much better over pasta or even a seafood lasagna. I used shrimp and lump crab meat. We managed to eat this two nights in a row so it wouldn't go to waste but I will not be making this again.",

I skipped all the peppers (hubby has heartburn issues with them) and used fresh cilantro instead of oregano. I also used small pre-cooked shrimp and 2 packages of lobster claw meat---scallops would've made it even better but they're rather spendy. The only thing I did different to the sauce was add some Adobo and I think it made it even better. There's a Mexican restaurant nearby that serves enchiladas almost identical to these and I always order them. Thanks to BAJATHECAT I can make my own now!",

                "reviewBody": "We made changes because my hubby is sensitive to fishy food. We used shrimp real crab & fake lobster (flake style). I thought this dish was amazing! The sauce was a bit runny so I recommend simmering until it thickens up nicely. This makes it easier for you to roll into enchiladas. That \"White Pepper\" is HOT so use sparingly!! It was pretty spicy at first but the reheated leftovers were not. (The level of spice diminished in the fridge.) If I made this dish again I would cut up my shrimp into smaller pieces & I was thinking that I could even use this as a seafood dip & omit the flour tortillas! Mmmmm!",
