It was great even without marinating time!  Added a couple of Thai red chilis also, and garnished with chopped cilantro.  Grilled without the plank.  This one is a must-try.  After making this a few times:  zipping up the ginger and garlic in a mini food processor makes it even easier.  Toasted sesame oil is delicious in place of the olive oil, and 1/8 teaspoon  is nice if you like some heat.",

I love garlic and was very liberal with it. Because of our busy schedules we had to postpone the meal an extra day (so it marinaded for two whole days). Oh my goodness!!! If there is any way you can soak it for two days Make it so!! We also soaked the cedar planks for two days in water. This really kept them from catching fire. Using fresh minced ginger is the only way to go (used extra ginger too).",
