You could make this with chicken, beef, or pork as well, just use the corresponding ramen soup flavor. I'm sure that a lot of people would also add sesame oil for more authentic flavor, but I find sesame oil overpowering (personal preference).",

Despite everything in me wanting to saute the shrimp and veg in a little EVOO and garlic I stuck to the recipe since I'm the primary reviewer. I followed everything to a \"T\" though I did have to sub frozen broccoli for frozen mixed veggies when I realized we were out. This came together in NO time (less than 10 minutes for real) and used freezer/pantry staples. Four servings is definately a stretch though. It served two of us and I could have eaten some more. THANKS for the recipe Nugyar!",
