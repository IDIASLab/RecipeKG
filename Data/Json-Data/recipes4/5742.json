The flavor was great and they turned out super juicy and tender. The one part of the recipe that doesn't work as written is that there is no way you can fit an entire onion in the cavity of a cornish. They are just too small. That's a good thing though because less ingredients is better right? One onion is more than enough for both of the birds. I very much enjoyed to cilantro and Adobo combo and this is one I will make again.",
