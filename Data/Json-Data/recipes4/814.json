The initial attempt required lots of added salt and pepper for extra flavor and the chicken broth/Worcestershire added almost no flavor.  The second time I made them, I coated the slices in a big bowl with salt, pepper, italian seasoning, about 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes and some olive oil.  Tossed to coat, placed potatoes on foil, didn't bother with onions, put slices of butter on top, sprinkled with plain shredded cheese and grilled.  They were incredible and much easier than the original recipe.  No matter how you cook them, you absolutely MUST spray your foil with a cooking spray or you will have a burnt, stuck-on mess!",
