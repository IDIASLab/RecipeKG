I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth for the rice because that's what I had on hand. I also used chicken broth for the rice so we wouldn't feel like we wanted to add extra salt later on. I did have to substitute peanut oil because I was out of sesame oil so I made up for that by adding some toasted sesame seeds as a garnish. Overall we really enjoyed this dish although I did let the eggs cook a little too long and the yolks got dry. There was a lot of the rice and lentils left over so I mixed them together took it to work for lunch the next day and added some yellow mustard to it. It was SO good that way! I'm sure I'll make this again soon. Thanks for a healthy inexpensive meal!",
