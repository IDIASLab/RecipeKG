I don't usually use white potatoes but I bought 2 large ones that gave me 4 or 5 cups of chopped potatoes. after the potatoes cooked I added 1 cup of silken tofu instead of adding cow's milk later. I had to add a little more water when I added the kale it was too thick my doing because of the tofu. it ended up very creamy. it was very filling the only thing we didn't like was the kale it was still too chewy for me. it didn't need salt n pepper.",
