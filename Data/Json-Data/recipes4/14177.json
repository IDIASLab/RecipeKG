I also skipped the flour/veg oil crumb mixture; to me it was unnecessary. 12-16-12: I didn't feel like kneading with my hand today spin used the bread machine instead but used the whole amount of 3/4 water and added at least 3/4-1 cup flour.",

Also I had to add much more flour than the recipe called for enough to make it solid enough to knead. I'll try these again for sure! Thanks!",

They were good and I will make them again but maybe roll them thinner so that the flour cooks better.",
