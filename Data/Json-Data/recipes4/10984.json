Icing or chips would be overkill nuts or coconut maybe. It was extremely moist--great with a glass of milk. My only problem was that the batter prepared as directed did cook over so it wasn't very pretty the first time. So the next time I made it I kept about a cup and a fourth of the batter and made a half dozen cupcakes with it. The cake stayed in the pan the kids got cupcakes and I had delicious cake that was pretty too! This recipe is good with any flavor box cake and icing.",

I added nuts (about a cup) and it came out perfectly. I almost took some out for cupcakes since others had problems with overflowing but now I think their bundt pans may have been too small; even with a cup of nuts added this came out great. I would not add more than one cup of additions or even the 10 inch might overflow. Came back to get the recipe I am going to try Lemon Supreme cake with Lemon Supreme icing. Update: The lemon came out much more like pound cake than the chocolate and was just as delicious. I replace half the oil with unsweetened applesauce when I have it and it tastes equally as yummy and is healthier.",
