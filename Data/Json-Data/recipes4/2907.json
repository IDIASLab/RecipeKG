Cheaper cuts of pork work just the same and have tons of flavor!  I used a 4 pound shoulder cut (also called Boston butt).  It was only $5, whereas a 2 pound cut of tenderloin was $10!  I cooked in the slow cooker for 7 hours, pulled it apart and mixed with Sweet Baby Ray's Hot and Spicy sauce, and then cooked for another hour.  I served them on Kaiser rolls with coleslaw and homemade fries from this site.  Amazing!!",

I added the root beer and let it cook on low for 5 1/2-6 hours. I then drained and pulled the pork apart easily with a fork. I returned the pork to the slow cooker and added the BBQ sauce and let it continue to cook on low for another 1-1 1/2 hours. It was so good and and my husband loved it.",

I was tired of the usual pot roast, and we have chicken all the time so,the idea of pulled pork occured to me.  I tweaked this reciped just a bit and the result was really good!  I knew a 2 lb tenderloin would never be enough for my family of 6, so on the advice of the butcher at my grocery store, I used a 4 lb shoulder (it had a small bone in it, but it slid out easily after cooking on low for 10 hours.  I mixed 1/2 cup of Bull's Eye Original Barbeque sauce with 2 cups of root beer then poured it over the roast, sprinkled it with a generous amount of dried minced onion, then drizzled some additional barbeque sauce over the roast.  Halfway through cooking, I turned the roast over, added more minced onions and another drizzle of sauce.  After 10 hours in the crock, I removed the roast, let cool slightly and then shredded it.  I mixed in the rest of the barbeque sauce, some salt and a little water to moisten it and served it on a bun. The result was a restuarant quality pulled pork sandwich that my whole family enjoyed!  I will definitely be making this again!",

I cooked it in just root beer for 6 hours, then drained it and cooked it in the BBQ sauce for an hour.  When I tasted it, it MELTED in my mouth!  It is SO GOOD!!!  Plus it was super easy!

It was so tender and juicy, I could barely take it out of the slow cooker!\n\nThe best thing is--7 pounds of pork shoulder was only about $10!!!!\n\nThe means you can make enough pulled pork sandwiches to feed about 30 people for about $15-20!!

I typically use pork butt or shoulder and cook it with a cup of water, shredding and adding the bbq sauce at the end.  I like the idea in this recipe of using pork tenderloin - it's a lot less fatty and very easy to shred/pull, although you may sacrifice some flavor using a leaner cut like this.  As for the rootbeer - it didn't seem to noticeably enhance the flavor of this dish for me.  In all fairness though, I did have a cold, so maybe that had something to do with it!  The rootbeer did however make for a messy crockpot when it came to clean up as the sugar caramelized on the side of the pot and was really tough to scrub off.  I'd recommend either using cooking spray on the sides of the crockpot, or trying a pan liner made for crockpots.  If like me you have trouble getting it clean - try scrubbing with your fingers using a paste made from Bon Ami.  Worked for me!",

With that being said if you are a traditionalist of a geographic region, this is probably NOT the recipe for you unless you like the sweeter sauces of Tennessee.  Experience imparts using a pork tenderloin will provide a drier meat, however using something will a little more fat such as a shoulder or butt will impart more flavor.  The main tip for this recipe is to ensure your meat is covered with liquid, or turn it every few hours.  Mixed with Sweet Baby Rays, Sweet and Spicy sauce to help counter the sweetness of the root beer and cooked for 1 hour longer to absorb the sauce into the meat.  Served on onion rolls with a sprinkling of French's French Fried Onion Rings on the meat and a side of apple coleslaw (from this site) for a quick dinner.  5 stars for a truly easy, no fuss, no muss recipe.",
