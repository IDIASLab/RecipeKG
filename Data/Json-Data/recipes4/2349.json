You can also use the Lipton dried onion in the box. I used the Onion and Mushroom for added flavor. Add 1/4 C Ketchup and mix in 2 eggs. Add dried bread crumbs until your meat mixture starts to hold form. After you place in baking dish,take 1/3 cup ketchup and mix in 4 or 5 T of Brown Sugar. If you don't have brown,use White. Pour over top of Meatloaf and bake. I put foil over top until the last 15 minutes of baking.  Believe me it is NOT too much ketchup.",

Stands alone just fine and makes great sandwiches the next day.  \nSince my family likes a bit more spice, and because Im always sneaking veggies into EVERY meal to confuse my picky eaters, I now add grated carrot and zuchinni to this base, as well as onion, celery or green pepper. You can even add radishes, grated turnips, etc. Whatever you have! Meatloaf was made to hide veggies inside!  Just dice or grind them very fine.  The Pork adds a bit of moisture and different texture and flavor which makes the loaf stand out with firmness, yet also moistness.  A perfect texture.  We love Garlic added, Greek Seasonings, even taco seasoning to create different variations o f this fine loaf!  YUm!",
