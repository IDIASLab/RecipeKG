My mother used to say that you \"had to beat a lot of love into it\" so I'm afraid those lumps only go away with a good beating....must be a strong Yorkshire arm that is needed or an electric whisk!!! It is also best left to stand for 10 minutes after beating.\r\nAs for flavour it is best served with a rich onion gravy....a very english taste! And if you can get Linconshire Sausages or herby sausages even better. \r\nGood luck and enjoy.",

However I have two constructive criticisms. Number one - the pan size was too large for the scant amount of batter. Using a smaller pan makes it more likely the batter will puff up with higher volume. Secondly I would reverse the order of the ingredients adding flour to the already-beaten liquid ingredients. I had a hard time getting the lumps out of the batter when adding eggs to flour.",
