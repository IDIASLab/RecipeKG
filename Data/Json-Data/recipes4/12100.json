The squash took about twenty minutes to become tender (so it made dinner late) and the mix of citrus and sweet (which I typically love) just didn't complement the squash. The spiciness of the cloves was the only thing that made this dish palatable and I ended up stirring the leftovers (which we had lots of) in with the leftover barley primavera (excellent side also from this site) to make it better. This could be pretty good with some modifications I think...dice the squash instead of cubing so it cooks more quickly maybe use diced dried apricots with a tablespoon of brown sugar instead of the preserves so it's not soooooo sweet and add a little bit of heat with some cayenne pepper. Anyway if I make it again I'll let y'all know how the changes turn out.",

Also juiced 1 whole small orange along with 1/2 very small lemon. I had some candied oranges with rind that were cooked in sugar and dark rum - and stored in the freezer. I chopped about 1 tbsp. very finely and soaked the mango and the orange rinds in the orange juice until they were soft while I roasted the squash in the oven with a little olive oil S&P for about 40 min. Once soft and able to mash coarsely I melted the butter and added the squash along with the soaked orange rind and mango until the juices were absorbed by the squash. When I am ready to serve I will re-heat in the oven at 350 degrees for maybe 15 minutes. The squash cooks down quite a bit - I had 1 whole squash that weighed in at 2 lbs. Used a potato peeler to peel the skin before I roasted it. Very easy - and tasted delish.... not too sweet with that tang from the orange rind and juice plus the surprise hint of mango gave the recipe pzazz.",
