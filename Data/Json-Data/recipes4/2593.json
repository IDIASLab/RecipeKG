Update...I made this with a pork roast and it was even better! BTW I cooked this both times in my slow cooker. I have the kind that takes 1/2 the time as the usual ones. and they were done in only 2 hours. I cooked a little longer only to make it more tender. Try this with a pork roast thoughas it truly is amazing, more than 5 stars.",
