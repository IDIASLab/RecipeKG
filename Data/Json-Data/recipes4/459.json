Look at the ingredients..butterscotch and peanut butter make one of the sweetest combinations known to mankind! This is not an everyday snack-it is a treat.   The easist no fail way to prepare is put it the chips, butter and peanut butter all in the same bowl and microwave it for 1 min...then stir until all the chips have melted.  Your butter and peanut butter wont seperate and it will turn out great!",

Then you add the marshmallows and cereal. They are meant to be whole and delicious. I've also had this many times w/o the cereal. It is a fun treat. Just do not make them like rice krispie bars -- the submitter did not mean for them to be melted -- see the description in step 2. Look at the pic for Rocky Road drops by adellois and you'll better be able to picture what this is like! Now yes you can get crazy creative and add many things to the colored marshmallows-- like different cereals M&Ms choco mini chips some white choco chips.... This treat is a classic. Maybe some of you need to see some other pictures to see how this is to look. It cuts through lovely and is fun to have all of the colors showing from the marshmallows! We always have made it in a buttered 9x13 (w/o rice cereal 9x9) dish and cooled it to get it to set. Enjoy!!",
