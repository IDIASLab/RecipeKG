I used boneless chicken breasts that had been marinating two days in Good Season's Italian salad dressing mix. I cut in small pieces and sauteed in a little olive oil until cooked through. I also used a lower carb high protein pasta Barilla. They didn't have bow ties so I used rotini. We all loved this and though I had increased the amount served to 8 for my family of 5 and a guest there wasn't a bit left.",

I tried to follow the recipe exactly but there were some issues: my store was out of red bell peppers so I used yellow and green instead I forgot to get fresh mushrooms so I used some sliced canned mushrooms from the pantry I was short on pasta so I used only half the amount called for. I look forward to trying this recipe again and next time will follow it exactly. The greek dressing I used was \"Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing\" that can be found on this site. I am only giving this recipe four stars because the directions for breading the chicken was difficult (using a ziplock bag is/was much easier) and because it did not have a recipe for greek dressing.",
