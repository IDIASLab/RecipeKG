I used refrigerated pizza dough and because all bottled cream sauces taste thick and artificial to me I used 1/2 c. of the sauce 1/4 c. of skim milk and added 2 cloves of minced garlic and fresh cracked black pepper. I believe this made the pizza far better for me. I also put the chicken under the cheese to prevent it from drying out. Even with these changes it was missing something for me.
