We love wings. I still wasn't sure if I'd like this since we usually fry our wings prior to coating them in sauce. I liked this just fine and in fact the leftovers hold up much better the next day. If you are looking for a healthier way of cooking hot wings then look no further.",

It only goes up to 400, but I figured to err on the safe side, and put 'em in for 15 minutes each side, (again to err on the safe side to make sure all water was out). Also had to change up the hot sauce to what I already had on hand. ;) flipped after 1 hour in slow cooker, 1/2 hour later I couldn't wait any longer, and they were right! Thank you.",
