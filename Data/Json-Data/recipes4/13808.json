My only reservation is that the soup just gets spread on top of the meat/grits mixture instead of mixing in so that when I cut into it there was a soupy layer oozing out above the grits. Next time I think I would just mix the soup with the grits before baking. Also I don't know if it's a mistake but the directions say to let the grits simmer for about 30 minutes. Typically grits are done after about 4-5 minutes. I didn't want to risk burning them so I removed them after 4 minutes which is the only change I made to the recipe. Overall it's not a bad little recipe but it didn't excite me too much.",
