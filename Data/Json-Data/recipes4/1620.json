                "reviewBody": "Abby s dish is just outstanding. We cooked it up because it made sense to use a cheese coating instead of breading to keep the dish moist. And in fact it worked beautifully. Do use fresh grated cheese though. If you use a Kraft type product this dish will disappoint. We were concerned about the low temp of 325 but it keeps the dish moist and genuinely tender. You need to use a baking dish that s big enough to put the rather bulky rolled portions in though. You have to leave good room between them so the heat circulates properly. Otherwise the touching sides don t leave the pink state. And you know those small portions of chicken that are found on the inside of the breast sometimes called chicken fillet? They cook up just as well using the cheese as your breading at this low temp at the same time you cook the real dish they are a delightful snack too. A final touch you might consider is a few minutes of high heat broiling. It s nice to get the top layer of prosciutto all the way to crisp. It ll probably crisp up before you can really brown this dish though so watch for that. Otherwise we highly recommend this dish it s terrific.",

Like another poster recommended I covered them with foil for the first 30 min then removed foil and baked another 8-10. The Penne Russo a la Vodka recipe on allrecipes is excellent with this. I served the vodka sauce over the chicken and over a side of pasta. It's a fantastic pairing! Definitely estaurant quality.",

If you used Parmesan cheese other than fresh dont bother to rate this recipe as I'm sure it would be bland dull and tasteless. Kraft makes a \"grate-it-fresh\" Parmesan that comes with a container and can be found next to the shredded and blocks of chesses in most markets. Its easy less expensive and VERY good cheese. I did alter it slightly for ease of cooking though did nothing to change the flavor.I use the garlic that is preminced in a jar (I always keep it on hand in the fidge) it's not as strong of a garlic taste (though I love garlic) so I sprinkled it with garlic powder before adding the cheese and procuitto. I also used a little less cheese because I bought the slices. I had the procuitto sliced VERY thin so I was able to roll 2 slices inside and then wrap 2 around the outside so I didnt need to use a tooth pick. The effect was delish the procuitto browned and was somewhat crunchy like bacon would be! YUM The wine and oil gave it a nice subtle flavor. But remove the chicken to a serving plate as the pan is only meant for it to be COOKED in!",

My husband is picky and doesn't really like chicken either but he ate every last piece and asked when we could have it again. I will make this a staple. The flavors blended perfectly and tasted like a dish I might order out to dinner. THANKS FOR THE AWESOME RECIPE!",

I also browned the rolls in a skillet with a little olive oil before putting them in the oven. I did not use the prosciutto on the outside. I did not want to overpower the flavor of the chicken. After baking I took the wine mixture which I added a little chicken stock and fresh minced garlic and shallot to and reduced it on the stove top by half. I added some heavy cream and reduced to a consistency able to coat the back of a spoon. I removed from the heat and added a T of butter to finish. It was a great sauce to compliment the flavors in the chicken. I served it with some traditional risotto. My boyfriend loved it!",

I didn't like the raw garlic in the middle of the breast I think it needed to be cooked first or maybe add a little garlic salt to the parmesan before you roll. Another thing I didn't like was when I removed the chicken from the oven the oil and wine separated and it wasn't appealing to see your dinner sitting in a puddle of oil. Oh yeah I think the chicken definitely needs to be browned before you put in the oven.",
