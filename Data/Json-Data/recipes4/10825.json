        "description": "A savory autumn stew with apple, red potatoes, onion and seasoning. This is a very easy tasty chicken dish I concocted when I was trying to think of a dish like pot roast yet using chicken rather than beef.  My husband hates mushrooms, so I tried condensed celery soup, and it works great.  This dish is light yet very zesty and full of flavor.  You can substitute using chicken thighs, but it will increase calories and fat.  I think using biscuit gravy mix rather than onion gravy mix would work (the flavor would go well with chicken), adding richness, although I haven't tried it that way yet, but again, it would add more fat and calories to this dish. Serve with a side of rice or over noodles.",

I modified it slightly.....added fresh sliced portabello mushrooms, half a bag of frozen broccoli, a half bag of baby carrots (sliced into about 4 or 5 pieces), one sweet potato (bite-sized pieces), added 2 extra apples, 3 extra garlic cloves, and used yukon gold potatoes (bite-sized pieces). I par-boiled the yukon gold potaoes with the sweet potatoes for about 15 minutes before adding them to the slow cooker. I also added about one cup of water and stirred it occasionally for the first few hours. We cooked it for about 10 hours. \nI was looking for something to make for my 82 year old Dad who's wife has been in the hospital for the past month. He's not used to cooking on his own.....or doing anything on his own, for that matter!! I put this stew in little microwave-safe containers and put it in his freezer for him to take out the night before and put in his fridge to thaw to eat the next day. Well.....he said it's the best stew that he's ever had in his whole entire life....and even though he has other food to eat, he's been taking a bowl of this stew out of his freezer every night after supper for supper the next night.... for the past week!! I asked him if he was getting tired of it yet....and reminded him that he has other food to heat up.....but he said that he looks forward to supper every night since he's had the chicken stew in his freezer. I have to admit...it's the best that I've ever had too  :)",

I used chicken breasts with the bone and skin sauteed in a couple of Tbsp. olive oil and garlic with garlic salt and pepper added 1/2 cubed sweet potato celery and baby carrots. I used Lipton golden onion soup mix added another 1/2 c water (total 1c water) and a can of chicken broth. You have to make sure your meat is covered in sauce if you cook it for 12 hrs on low (I commute). I didn't have italian seasoning so I used parsley and a dash of chili powder. The meat fell off the bone and was not too dry. I couldn't taste the apple so next time I will use 2 and probably use granny smith instead of red. I couldn't even taste the cream of celery either so I might not use it next time. I found that it didn't have as much flavor as I usually expect from pot roast or stew. A little more salt helped though. It was probably too diluted with the extra water. Next time I will add more salt/seasoning maybe even some chicken boullion. All in all a good base recipe to build on...",

I added carrots and celery to the crockpot and then added a bag of mixed veggies about an hour before serving. Next time I will probably add another apple too. I didn't eat it with rice or noodles because I'm trying to keep my carbs down but it was a very good veggie filled stew.:)",
