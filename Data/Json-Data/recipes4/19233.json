Turns out I didn't have any white rice so I used brown rice, and I used a left over ear of corn instead of canned.  Served it with tortillas and YUM!  It was more soup like when I first opened the insta-pot, but by the time we went back for seconds the rice absorbed all of the juice and it was still really good. I'm new to  insta-pot  cooking so it was probably something I did, but it was easy, fast and really good!",

Rather than jarred salsa, used diced fresh tomatoes, and canned green chiles in addition to a lot more cumin, chile powder, as well as granulated garlic and onion powder to taste. 2 cups was too much water, since there was liquid coming from the tomatoes - used 3/4 cup water instead.

Here are changes I made:   Brown rice instead of white. 7/8 tsp of both chili powder and cumin gave it a nice bite. A smidge more salt . Cooked on high pressure x 15 minutes, natural release x 10 minutes then  quick release. NEXT time I would decrease water by 1/4-1/2 C. We served with slotted spoon  on warmed tortillas with low fat sour cream, chopped lettuce and additional salsa. We added cheese and cilantro to individual servings . I think this would also be great on taco salad or served with tortilla strips or Fritos in top.",
