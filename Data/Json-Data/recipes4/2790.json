Instead of all black beans, I used kidney, great northern, black, and pinto beans to give it a variety of color, texture and flavor.  I also added some frozen corn to give it a little something extra.  This is a delicious recipe and I will definitley use it again!  If I am making it for just my husband and me, I will atleast halve this recipe as it makes alot!!",
