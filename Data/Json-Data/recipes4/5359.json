We also used this recipe as a base and increased the buttermilk to thin and make a batter for fried zucchini, which was a huge hit. Definitely a keeper recipe.",

Because others said the batter was too runny (and it was), I left out an egg (I used 2 large ones) and used 1/2 c. milk.  I added flour  till it was the right consistency, about 1 to 1-1/2 c.  I will make these again even if I am not having a fish fry!  This made quite a few using a small cookie scoop and cooked up to golf ball sized.  You could easily half the recipe.",

These are VERY tasty and light, just like proper hush puppies should be, IMO. I did halve the recipe, but still used 1 teaspoon each of the garlic and onion powders, which gave these great flavor. I will def be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)",
