My picky grandaughter loves this and she \"Hates tomatoes and spinach\". Since I don't cook with salt, I used 1 tsp garlic powder, onion powder and a small pinch of cumin and Italian seasoning and put in the food processor with the tomatoes and spinach.  If you don't cook the ravioli you can put in frozen and just add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water to the sauce.  Comes out of the oven really yummy",
