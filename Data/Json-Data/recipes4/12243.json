For spices changed it to: 2 tbsp garam masala 2 tbsp cumin 1 tbsp ginger 1 tbsp onion powder 1 tbsp yellow curry powder 1/2 tbsp salt 1 tsp cracked pepper 1 tbsp Essence of Emeril (for heat since the wife doesn't like things too spicy). I used chicken tenders and seared them after coating them in garam masala. Took them out after the sear diced them and added them back near the end. Added juice and zest of 2 limes and a handful of cilantro at the end. I added cayenne pepper to my plate while my wife took hers with a little yougurt since she hates spicy food. For the rice I toasted the rice first with onion garlic and ginger then added about 4c of water for 1.5c of rice. Made it have more of a pilaf texture. Added juice of a lime cilantro and frozen peas at the end.",

The end result: way way too spicy and I am pretty sure it was the cayenne pepper that 'killed' it (not the extra few seeds). Otherwise a tasty dish - my husband liked it alot. If I try it again I will be sure to reduce the spices to 1/2 and then go from there.",

I love the consistency of the sauce. I made rice in the rice cooker with sauteed onions and turmeric-so pretty. 3 or more stars=will make again.",
