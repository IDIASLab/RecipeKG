I wanted it rare and I was afraid that the strips would over-cook. The instructions read: \"simmer until the sauce thickens\". There really wasn't any sauce to speak of from one can of tomatoes so I added some V8 juice to create some. I increased the amount of paprika too: 2 tsp sweet-and-smoky and 1 tsp of hot paprika. But that's just personal preference. This dish was scumptious. DH had two helpings at dinner and then ate the leftovers for breakfast this morning. A real keeper. Thanks Jayda!",

The quick cooking process doesn t allow the flavors time to come together so the end result is very bland. I tossed everything back in the skillet (minus the gnocchi) added a little water and let it simmer with a covered lid for about an hour. The added cooking time really enhanced the flavor making it more like a pepper steak and the meat was nice and tender. If I were doing it over I would start by browning the meat add all of the ingredients except the gnocchi and simmer in a covered pot for at least an hour.",
