I am from Georgia and I know.  Turnip greens maybe, but not collards!  SECOND, you MUST eat collard greens with chopped raw tomatoes and chopped raw onions sprinkled on top (plus pepper sauce if you like it, but if you don't know what this is, forget it, I'm not going into it.  Well, okay, I'll try.  Suffice it to say it's peppers stuffed into a bottle of white vinegar and left to sit either on a shelf (how the oldens did it) or in the fridge for a few months, then you sprinkle the juice on the greens -- but don't ask me what kind of peppers.  I just know they're green, medium hot, and I know them when I see them).  THIRD, if you don't want the fat of hamhock or salt pork, you can use smoked turkey wings and the flavor is still quite good.  But whatever you do, DON'T try to cook collard greens without some kind of salted meat.",

When the greens are fully cooked, I remove the ham hocks, shred the meat, and add it back to the greens.  One tip for when you're prepping - I wash the cut collards in my sink 3 times, adding baking soda to the first wash.  This helps remove some of the bitterness.",

I NEVER ate collards with freshly chopped onions and tomatoes and my whole family from the south...it sounds good though but NOT a MUST :)! When you cook something cook it to your liking...you have to eat it! For those who are not familiar with collards...depending on how fresh your collards are, whether they are in season all are factors to consider. I have had some greens that are soooo tender I can cook em' in a short time (an hour or so). I have had green soooo tough I had to cook them overnight! It depends. Sometimes I add sugar to my greens (depends on the batch again). It's shouldn't be sweet however. I love to top my greens with peppered vinegar and I'm good to go!!! Have fun with your cooking! Don't get frustrated if you get a \"bad\" batch of greens (tough, real bitter, etc). this is a dish that is worth the effort. Good ol' comfort! One Love :0)",

At the suggestion of a native southern woman (my boyfriend's mother), I skimmed the fat off of the top of the water before I added the collard greens.  She said that this would keep the greens from being too greasy.  Apparently, a lot of the flavor is in the water, because the collards turned out great with a wonderful, smokey flavor.  One note for novice cookers (like myself): be careful with the red pepper flakes.  They can overpower the greens if you accidentally add too much.",

Salt Pork (or Fat Back) can be used to season the greens but after simmering for two hours what ever meat you use will be falling to pieces so I recommend using ham hocks which have less fat. I didn't have any red pepper flakes on hand so I used some southwest seasoning which contained cayenne. I wasn't sure about adding the vegetable oil at the end but I don't think the final product would have been as good if I hadn't.\nEdit: I just wanted to add a new trick I learned this year. I like to trim the thickest parts of stems out of my greens so they are good and tender. In the past I have spent time cutting the stems out of each leaf. The trick is to make a  circle with the thumb and first finger of one hand and starting with the stem end pull the green leaf through the circle with the other hand. Don't pinch, keep the circle loose. The leaf peels right off the stem. Then, instead of chopping the greens, roll a few leaves together loosely and cut them with cooking shears. Saved me several minutes this year.",
