I did make a few changes...used a sirloin roast, used a oven bag instead of foil, used a spice rub for the meat, used 2 cans of soup, and spiked the soup/onion mix with a few healthy doses of Worcester sauce...threw in a few redskinned potatoes quartered, a couple small onions...baked at 325 for the full 4 hours, and it was a HUGE HIT! The meat was so tender, juicy and flavorful...and the gravy was out of this world, use 2 cans soup for extra gravy, you wont be sorry! \nThanks for a great recipe Lynn!",

Since I had a meeting and wouldn't be home at dinner time, I needed to make a meal in one...I used an oven bag inside a 9 X 13\" pan, coated with 1 TBSP of flour. I set the roast inside the bag and topped it with about 1/4 cup of Lea & Perrins steak sauce. I mixed 2 cans of mushroom soup (instead of 1) with the dry onion soup mix and spooned and patted it over the roast. I then set 6 peeled and 1/4-ed potatoes and many baby carrots around the roast. I closed up the bag, following instructions included with bags. I baked it at 325 degrees for 2 3/4 hours. The vegies were perfect and the meat was tender. The gravy was AWESOME! My family LOVED it and I enjoyed it VERY MUCH, even though I had to eat it reheated! Thanks, Lynn, for a GREAT recipe to build on!",

Also, I did not cook it as long as \r\nwas recommended, only until a meat thermometer registered an appropriate\r\ntemperature for medium rare beef.
