I always keep 1 cup portions of rice in the freezer in zip-lock bags.  About 2 minutes in the microwave heats it up, and then it's ready to go into the skillet.  Also, I don't think the almond milk is an option, you really need some liquid to reach a good consistency (I used about 1/4 cup).  I'm going to try this again because I think it has potential, but I will start with 1/2 tsp cinnamon (not 2 tsp) and add more if needed because, unfortunately, the cinnamon overpowered everything.  I'm giving this 4 stars but adjusting the cinnamon to your own personal taste should take this to a 5.",
