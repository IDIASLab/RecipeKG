One way was per recipe, with finely chopped cabbage, (for my kids who \"claim\" not to like it, they liked it this time) and the second was with quartered cabbage,  & with fresh polish sausage from my AWESOME butcher (my mom always told me to \"make friends with the butcher\" & it has paid off) for my husband & I.  WOW, I halved the butter & cooked the sausage with the potatoes & onion then added the cabbage for 5 min.  GREAT!  I had a nice long lunch out with my sisters today & this was a nice easy meal to make up lost time with!!  The kids enjoyed their version & we enjoyed ours as well..sooo easy!  Thanks Priscilla!!",

I used chicken broth instead of the water and added it as needed so cabbage wouldn't stick or burn.

I doubled the amount of ham and cut into small pieces so there was ham in every bite.  This was absolutely delish!

The first time I made it my \"medium heat\" is apparently a little too hot with only 1/4 cup water and therefore left unattended a little too long resulted in a burnt mess. HOWEVER I tried it again today using 3/4 cup chicken broth instead of 1/4c water (which I started with 1/2c and added the remaining as needed) and turned out great! I also sprinkled all-season salt garlic and onion powder to taste when I added the potatoes. At the end I sprinkled about 1/2c sharp cheddar cheese overall. We all thought this had awesome taste and I would make it again! Not very elegant but it sure is filling! Thanks Priscilla!",

Also to quicken up the preparation time I used a can of diced potatoes instead of chopping up the recommended number of spuds. And this way I didn't have to worry about over cooking to get the potatoes tender. Added some pepper for little more flavor. I will be making this again. I've also found after making this a few times it taste better the next day as leftovers. So now I make it allow it to cool then put it in the fridge to eat the next night.",
