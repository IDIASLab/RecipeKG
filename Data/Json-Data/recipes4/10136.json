I don't like bland so added extra tbsp. curry powder and 2 tsp. garam masala 6 whole cloves extra clove of garlic 2 tsp. Tunisian chili powder and 1 cinnamon stick. Didn't know what to do with the rest of the coconut milk as I don't use it very often so used the whole can (2 cups) and just omitted the regular milk. I had 4 lbs. thighs and legs and deskinned them. With 4 lbs. it is going to take more than 25 minutes of simmer to get the chicken done so didn't add the potatoes until later on. I didn't grind any onion just cut them into slices for some substance to the dish. Also added about a cup of chick peas for some substance. Served with basmati rice. If making this recipe as is I would suggest bumping up the spices or making an Indian style rice that would also add some spice.",

I used yellow curry and I'd like to try it with other kinds. I used light coconut milk added a little cayenne to make it spicy and used honey to balance out the curry not white sugar. The flavor was phenomenal. I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts because it's what I had on hand but I'd like to try it with regular chicken. If you want to cut down cooking time try throwing the potatoes in early with the browning onions to get them started on their way. Again it was great! Thanx!",

To spice it up I added two chicken bouillon cubes 1 teaspoon of basil 1/2 teaspoon sugar to balance the curry and black pepper to taste. I also cut back the curry to 3 tablespoons primarily because my family doesn't like it that spicy. I'd also suggest browning the chicken with the onion before adding the sauce to give it more color. I added some mushrooms which were good if you like them. The sauce would be good with shrimp as well but you might add 1 or 2 tablespoons of fish sauce instead of the chicken bouillion.",

I also gave some to my friend and she flipped out. I used half a package of chicken breast half a large potato half a yellow onion a can of coconut milk just a splash of regular milk and 3 tbsp of Madras curry powder. We like things spicy so if you like it a little milder cut back to 2. If it comes out unbearable you can add some more milk in and let it reduce until it feels right. It came out with a beautiful yellow color and my hands smelled deliciously of curry afterward. Served over rice it makes for a great introductory Indian dish.",
