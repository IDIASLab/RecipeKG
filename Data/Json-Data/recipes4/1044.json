I felt like I created a tavern on the green original. One note-do be very careful and WATCH the internal temp closely!! Remove from oven when it's 140 for medium-which was my goal. The temp will go up (for me it went 8 degrees more) while the tenderloin \"rests\" 10-15min prior to slicing and serving. It came out PERFECT-so juicy and flavorful!! I did put the garlic- in small chunks from the marinade on top of the tenderloin prior to putting it in the oven. Everyone raved! This is my new fav guest/dinner party menu item .....the only downside is the price of beef tenderloin ($13.99/lb) or we'd have this more often and not just special occasions. The cheese sauce was great-but it gets thick once it cools....I'd suggest to keep it in one of the thermal gravy type servers if you have it avail.",

Hubby and I were preparing our Valentines dinner we had two strip steaks. I didn't read the recipe correctly. I halved the amounts due to just having two steaks. I did not marinate the meat we grilled it with salt pepper and garlic powder. I then put ALL of the ingredients together in a saucepan. The exceptions were that I used FETA cheese and used the garlic out of the jar from the produce section. I used a really good Merlot that we had with our dinner. This gave the mixture a pink appearance that was PERFECT for Valentines Day! I was worried in the beginning but it turned out beautiful (candlelight makes us all look better - LOL!) We served this over the steaks sauteed onions jumbo cooked shrimp along with a baked potato that I had coated in olive oil and sea salt and then baked at 425 for one hour. We couldn't eat our salads. This needs to be submitted as its own recipe! My husband kept going \"mmmmm\" during the meal LOL! 2/14/05 Made this again tonight for my children for Valentines Day. I only added a splash of Teriyaki sauce and 2 splashes of Worc. sauce and hubby and I liked it much better. My son went crazy over this! Delish! Thanks:-) Updat - Made this for Christmas Eve 2005. I made it exactly to recipe and it was DELICIOUS! Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "Delicious! My husband and teen loved it. I made this with a beef rump roast since tenderloin is out of our budget.  I increased the garlic in the marinade to 4 cloves since we are garlic fanatics, used Merlot for the red wine, and increased the marinating time to about 3-4 hours for a less tender cut.  I cooked the rump roast in a shallow pan at 325 for about 1/2 hour per pound for medium rare.  Next time I think I will try a London Broil, and cook it using the tendeloin method described in this recipe.  The sauce is outstanding, a wonderful blend of flavors, and the blue cheese taste isn't overpowering.  We enjoyed the extra sauce on our baked potatoes.  Thanks for a keeper.",

Not only was the sauce delicious (both on the beef but on baked potatoes) but it gave those who didn't like blue cheese a way to enjoy the flavorful meat. Even those who claimed to not like blue cheese approved of the smooth-tasting sauce. My only changes were as others suggested to increase the garlic to three cloves and to marinate it for a longer time. Great recipe!",
