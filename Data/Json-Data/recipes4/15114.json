Just right out of the ice water into the flour-cornmeal mixture and into the skillet. The tomatoes didn t turn to mush and they had a nice thin crust which stayed on well not a heavy breading like many recipes have which often can interfere with the actual green tomato flavor. The only thing I did differently was to lightly sprinkle some sugar on the tomatoes instead of salt. This is always the way I ve eaten them and I think it works well with the tartness of the tomato. Enjoyed your recipe thanks for sharing!",

I'd rather have the flavor of the green tomatoes front & center instead of fading into the background with a thick coating of crumbs or cornmeal.  The ice water works a treat for keeping the cornmeal stuck to the tomatoes. I used Martha White cornbread mix, which is what I always use for breading seafood.  If you make FGTs often, treat yourself to a great kitchen tool... a serrated peeler. It's made for peeling peaches, tomatoes, eggplant, etc.",
