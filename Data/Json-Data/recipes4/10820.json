Instead of wrapping the bacon around the chicken I wrapped the pastrami around the chicken then fried up the bacon and crumbled it over the top of the dish before baking. It turned out wonderfully. The only negative comment I would make was that the cream sauce was a bit gloppy. Maybe it was because I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream (I was out of sour cream) but I doubt it.
