I really like this method of cooking neck bones v/s boiling them.  Normally, I follow the recipe as written but I made the following changes to suit my taste:  I used three lbs. of neck bones seasoned with Lawry's seasoning salt, black pepper & Goya adobo seasoning, one onion, four cloves garlic, 1/2 c water & 2 TBSP vinegar.  I didn't baste the neck bones but after 2 hrs I added 1/4 c water, cooked 30 mins covered and removed foil during last 30 mins.  The neck bones were tender and in tact.  I'll definitely use this recipe again but will probably use less garlic or just omit it next time - personal taste.  This recipe is a keeper and Kudos to Keryne for sharing!!!!!",
