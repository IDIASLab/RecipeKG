Hungarian goulash should be a flexible recipe, and you should taste it and adjust it when it is almost cooked, to suit your own taste.  I am of Hungarian origin and these changes come close to my grandma\u2019s goulash:  there is no need to separate the onions from the meat, stir fry the onion, then add the meat, stir fry again, the add all other ingredients to the same pot except the water, stir fry again, then add the water last. Feel free to vary this according to what you have at home. Tomato instead of tomato paste, Or even no tomato! \r\n I add 2-3 tbsp more paprika (the sweet kind, not the hot kind) half as much tomato paste, and may add some chopped green pepper (no more than 1/2 cup), a bit more garlic, I always add 2-3 tbsp soy sauce, and even a bit of spicy chili sauce...to enhance the beefy flavour.... the key is to let the  'gravy' form by stewing it until the juices thicken without any flour added; the cheaper cuts of beef are better for this, as they are more flavourful and provide more 'gravy'.( I use boneless short rib roast that I cube, so that I know the consistency will be uniform) if at the end the stew seems watery, then boil it down until you like the consistency, if it seems dry, then add some water.  \r\n",

We call goulash only the soup version.\nIndeed this dish can be done in many different ways. With all due respect I would like to add some comments on how you can make it better (just in my point of view).\nFirst of all it is said that you have to add the same quantity (in weight) of onions as you add of meat. So if you make goulash from 3 pounds you need to add at least six big onions or more. It makes the gravy thicker and better.\nFrom the garlic you need to add at least a whole one not just a clove. You don't need to mince it because of the long cooking time. Just chop one clove to three-four pieces.\nPlease do not add tomato paste, instead add two or three tomato.\nI recommend to add two sliced carrots to this quantity of meat.\nThis dish is best when it is a bit hot, so add some chilli to it.\nAlso it is very advisable to add red wine, half pint to this quantity of meat.\n\nCarrots and garlic can be put in the pot after 45 mins. Tomato and chilli after one hour. Half of the red wine after 1 and a half hours, second half after a hour and 45 mins from the start.",

For instance I added more paprika and garlic added a little flour to thicken and used chicken broth for the water nearly double the amount called for. I added some mixed chopped bell peppers and fresh sliced mushrooms which proved to be a flavorful plus. Rather than simmering this on the stove I transferred it to the oven and cooked it at 325 degrees for 2 hours. The wonderful aroma while this was cooking was such a tease but the result was well worth the wait. The meat was fork tender and the sauce richly flavored. I served this over buttered egg noodles with a dollop of sour cream and sprinkle of fresh minced parsley. Even after supper hubs was still raving about it! A definite \"make again\" dish.",

I think it would also be great with a few vegetables like carrots and potatoes but this way is probably the traditional way. The longer it stews the better so it doesn't qualify as quick. It's great for a cold drizzly fall day when you have nothing better to do than stay indoors and cook up some comfort! We served it with Rhonda's Spaetzel which was also very good. P.S. We just use enough oil to keep it from sticking so it's probably not 1/3 cup and we used half the amount of salt called for. We also passed on the sour cream garnish.",
