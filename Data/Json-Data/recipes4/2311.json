I think this dish would be better as a hot pasta dish instead of being a stand-alone dish. I hope to make this dish again and again but with a few changes: Dice up the chicken; add 1 cup chicken broth and boil it down to create a nice sauce; serve it over penne pasta and include the sun-dried tomatoes again. I look foward to trying it with the above changes.",

In all excellent recipe and would recommend it with these changes! Enjoy!",
