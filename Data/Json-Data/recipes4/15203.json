First I started by saut\u00e9ing the onions garlic and added a chopped bell pepper and three celery rinsing. The carrots got left out. I subbed the beer with clam juice and used generous helpings of thyme dried parsley cayenne pepper black pepper and cajun seasoning (Tony Chachere's) for the spices (the clam juice and Tony's were salty enough that no salt was needed!) Instead of the garlic chili sauce I used a Louisiana-style hot sauce. I used frozen corn instead of canned but I might just forego the corn next time. It wasn't bad but didn't seem to add much. It came out so delicious!",
