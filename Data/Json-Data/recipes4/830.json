                "reviewBody": "I enjoyed these and they were very easy to make. I used both Hawaiian Sweet Rolls and Hawaiian Honey Wheat - the store I went to didn't have Savory Butter flavor as another poster mentioned. The sweetness was a little overbearing but I could taste the concept of the recipe and will definitely be making it again with a different roll. That being said I followed the recipe to the letter with one addition I placed the pan of \"bites\" inside another pan that had about a 1/2-inch water in it. The steam would prevent the rolls from getting hard on both the top and bottom. The smell of this dish was definitely that of WC the taste was close - close enough everyone enjoyed them. I didn't have a problem with the cook time as others did the meat was done in 30 minutes just as stated in the recipe and it wasn't soggy or unevenly cooked. I still have some of the mix left I just have to run to the store and get some more rolls. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks Kathy W for posting it. TIP: If your rolls are buring check the location of your oven rack it may be too close to the top or bottom of the oven it s/b in the center. Also if the meat is not done in the time recommended the patty may be too thick these should be thin burgers just like the restaurant. UPDATE: I tried the recipe using Hawaiian Savory Rolls WITHOUT the water bath and the rolls were kinda crunchy/toasted I prefer the softer bun using the water bath.",

There is a lot of conflicting info in the reviews and after reading it all I tried the recipe as submitted but ended up with raw meat. So, I retried using 90/10 ground beef and mixed ingredients then rolled meat mixture out and cut into 24 squares with a pizza cutter. I placed patties in a large glass baking dish and baked meat only at 350 for 25 minutes which was a little long...try 15-20 minutes. Then I placed the patties on buns (do not use sara lee; this is WAY too much bread) using King' Hawaiian SAVORY BUTTER rolls. Cover in foil and heat in oven at 350 for 10 up to 15 minutes until warm.
