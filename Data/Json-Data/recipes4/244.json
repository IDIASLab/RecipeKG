I upped the garlic a bit and added a little kosher salt to the mix. I love the pairing of fresh rosemary and thyme. These were very good especially when served with \"Grilled Delmonico Steaks\" from this site. I think next time though in order to get more of the garlic and herb flavor to come through I might use a foil pan and cube the potatoes then toss them with the olive oil garlic herbs and kosher salt and then cook them on the grill.",

The rosemary was very distinct, so I may cut it in 1/2 next time.  Thanks Rick!",
