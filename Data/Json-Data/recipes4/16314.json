Use a hammer to crush them, or poultry shears....the marrow in the bones is LOADED with good nutrients and flavor. This makes all the difference in the world, and your broth should end up somewhat gelatinous. \nAlso, as at least one other reviewer pointed out, your best bet is to strain and then allow the broth to cool so you can remove the fat.\nOther than this, it's a great recipe.",
