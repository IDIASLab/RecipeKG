I saut\u00e9ed baby Bella\u2019s and red onions first, then added the spices and garlic/ginger. Then I added chopped Roma tomatoes and the thawed spinach. Once simmered, threw it in the food processor, blended it up and threw it back in the wok with cubed queso blanco. It tasted EXACTLY like Indian cottage cheese. Much easier to find at the grocery store too! Just don\u2019t buy a flaky queso blanco. 5 stars of deliciousness!!",
