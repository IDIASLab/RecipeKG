They will be perfectly juicy and have that delightful \"snap\" when you bite into them. This sandwich is nothing new for us, but grilling the peppers and onions made all the difference in the world.  Until now I had always cooked them in a skillet and while that's delicious too, it is no substitute for what the submitter intended in this recipe.  I was really amazed at the difference the roasted, charred peppers and onions made, in color as well as taste. Out of this world good!",

My husband and I are no strangers to making these and definitely feel you shouldn't have to wait for summer to have such a treat. We use both hot and sweet sausage and use red and green peppers along with the onion. We love grilling veggies and these give the sandwiches a nice smokiness. Be sure not to poke the sausages as you'll end up releasing all of those wonderful juices. I put my rolls under the broiler to get them nice and toasty. My husband tops his sandwich off with a spicy brown mustard, but I always top mine off with marinated cherry tomatoes. I cut them in half and marinate them at room temp. in a mix of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, a bit of kosher salt, basil and oregano. For a quick and easy meal there's nothing that beats this!",

You can cut up the peppers and onions and grill them  OR buy what my grocer sells as a frozen \"Fajita mix\" of onions and peppers.  Either way, put them in a foil pouch with a couple of ounces of olive oil, salt, pepper and a little chopped garlic, more if you like.   Fold the foil up good so it doesn't leak all over and set your grill on fire.  Just keep flipping the foil packet while your meat cooks and it wil turn out deeeeeeeelishous ",

I parboiled my sausages for 5 minutes on the stove top. My concern was that the inside would not be cooked in the middle and too brown on the outside. We always top ours with pizza or spaghetti sauce and a slice of mozzarella cheese! These are also great make in the slow cooker with a jar of red sauce.",

Then browned the sausage first; drained and threw in the peppers until they were soft. What a difference that made. The sausage tasted infused with the peppers. Then added a bit of mustard. WOW!
