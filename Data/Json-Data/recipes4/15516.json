I did add 1 tsp of garlic, I used cheddar jack cheese instead of plain cheddar, plain petite diced tomatoes since the kids were eating and I also used frozen chopped spinach because that is what I had on hand. It was a nice alternative to regular stuffed peppers. My husband and 2 year old loved it and my 5 year old liked it after he got over the look of it. I used red and green peppers, I preferred the red and my son preferred the green peppers. Over all a great meal.",

I didn't use tomatoes with chiles but diced up some canned whole tomatoes (1/2 lg can). After the rice was cooked I cover the cream cheese with it so it would melt it. I used fresh onion (1 small) diced. I grated 1 8oz block of sharp cheese and added approx 1/2c of mozzarella to top the halves. I also blanched the pepper halves for 3 minutes in boiling water to ensure they were soft before filling them. 1 c. uncooked rice made approx. 2.5c cooked rice so I just used the extra. With using the extra rice I made 10 halves. Without the chiles it was great for those who like mild flavor. It was beautiful and had a nice flavor that most people can tolerate (those intolerant to spice).",
