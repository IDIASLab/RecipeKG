This is excellent the way it's presented but I suggest that you reserve some of the noodle cooking water to add instead of tap. Italians know to add pasta water in dishes that require water. The starches released from the noodles give a richer creamier consistency to the dish than plain water.",

The thickness of Kluski noodles is the key to it really tasting good I was told by one of the church ladies that gave me directions. Also adding a tsp. of caraway seeds was called for. Not gourmet but good comfort food. And with the price of meat going up it is a great way to stretch a meal. Thanks",
