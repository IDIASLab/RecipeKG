To add some actual flavor to this recipe add onion powder to the dough at least 1/2 teaspoon and some PEPPER to the potatoes I added tellicherry fresh cracked pepper and some chives as well. With the onions omg add them to the potatos themselves!! Carmalize them and add them to the mashed potatoes ,and make sure to season the potatoes with sea salt and pepper and once u add the carmalized onions they will pop with flavor.  I also use dry curd cottage cheese to which carmalized onions have been added as well. If you want to make a cream soup ,save the water u boil the pieriogies in and reduce it by half,then add some cream and pop back in some unfried pierogies and you have a nice cream soup recipe for the next day.

Once made,I wrap well and freeze first, then when I need to make perogys I thaw the dough in the fridge. It has a better texture after being frozen. I use quite a few different fillings but our fav. is potato and cheddar cheese. It has to be old cheddar though, this gives it more flavour. I use five pounds of potatoes and 1 1/2 pounds of grated cheddar, that  needs to be put into the potatoes when they are hot when mashing, also lots off fresh ground pepper to taste.  I also do not roll the dough and cut. I cut strips, roll into snakes and slice of pieces to flatten with a rolling pin. this way there is no waste and the dough does not become tough from over working.",

But overall a really good recipe and somewhat easier than other pierogie recipes I have made in the past.",
