They are packed with protein and vitamins and minerals with all the nuts and grains. They are very filling as well. I added hemp seeds in with the nut powder for a little extra kick and they kind of overtook the flavor of the rest of the nuts. So I may go lighter on those next time. I also substituted Agave Nectar for the honey because it has a lower glycemic index. I am excited to try out different dried fruits and other sweet things such as peanut butter with this recipe. It is perfect as is though too. Thanks!",

Only change I made is I m not a chocolate lover so I left the chips out but added more nuts and grains. Didn t have rice krispies on hand so I used a crunchy oat cluster cereal. Other than that these bars are perfect and it s a great idea to place them in baggies for those times you need a quick energy snack. Another idea crumble these up into a container bowl and keep in fridge because it makes a great topping over yogurt and berries. Will definitely make again!",
