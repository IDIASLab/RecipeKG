I did add some ground pepper at serving of the soup and this may not be the tradition in West Africa but it was fantastic. Will definitely make this again. Also used a few more basil leaves as I love basil but did not over power it. Thought of Anthony Boudain as I enjoyed this soup. I could see him in West Africa enjoying this one. Thanks for the great recipe.",
