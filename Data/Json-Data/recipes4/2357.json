I use very soft butter and brush on rinds, place on parchment lined cookie sheet and sprinkle on cinnamon sugar/substitute and bake in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes or so to let the butter crystalize the sugar/substitute.  The are very very good!  Try this on left over pie crust.\n\nFor you non-lovers...give this a try.  Im sure you will change your mind.",

I put the melted butter on the pork rinds and was shaking the bowl...but the butter was making the pork rinds pop and sizzle..Then quickly added the cinnamon and sugar and it was too cinnamon flavored and not sweet at all. Plus my rinds were soggy. So tried to let them dry and just didn't work. I was excited about this...concept was good but maybe use liquid spray butter and use a 2 tablespoon splenda to 2 tsp cinnamon ratio. Sorry won't make this again.",
