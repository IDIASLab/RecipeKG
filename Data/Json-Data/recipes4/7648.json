The heat turned out milder than you would think as it was cut by the butter and wine. My husband says it's \"good enough for Dinner Group\" and would like it weekly. Now the part I hate when other people do, my changes: used 1.5 lbs for 2 people and have leftovers for another meal, had panko so used that, used 1/4 c oil to toss (I think it could be 1/8 c), had fresh garlic so used that, used combination of hot sauces that I had, oh and used gruyere (on sale but I loved the earthy taste against the hot sauce and would repeat). I'll try maybe hotter and uncovered more next time for a crispier topping. I used a spatula to lay on top the linguine (and keep the crispy on top) then spooned some extra pan sauce on pasta. Easy too. The most time consuming was peeling the shrimp (again, easy-peel was on excellent sale) Thank you for sharing Lisa!!! YUM!",

Everything was great but personally took it down in some aspects to suit our tastes. I halved the wine and substituted in fresh lemon juice for the other half. I did half bread crumbs and half panko. I halved the oil and the butter (just seemed too much) and it was still more than enough. The only \"tweak\" to cooking it I made was I reserved some of the bread/panko mixture and after it baked added some more of the bread layer just before the cheese then broiled for about 10 minutes. EVERYONE loved it especially my \"culinary\" elders who are very hard to please. I've already been asked to share the recipe.",

One thing I did to cut down on oil is toss the shrimp in oil to coat then put the shrimp in bread crumb garlic salt & pepper mixture then place in pan. I didn't use fresh parsley just used Italian style breadcrumbs with parsley in it. The last 5 mins of baking I broiled it. Served over angel hair pasta (mixed with tiny bit of olive oil ang garlic).
