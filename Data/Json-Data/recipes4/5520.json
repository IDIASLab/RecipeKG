He used sharp white cheddar cheese and added a couple shakes Frank's Hot Sauce and four quartered all beef hot dogs, as he wanted to make it a little more personal. The kids and I loved this macaroni and cheese recipe and my son was quite tickled that he was able to make it on his own.",

I find it makes a big difference with the taste and regular cheese melts more easily. A few other things I found:\n-definitely make sure to add cheese very gradually into the milk (esp. with low fat cheese)\n-don't worry if the cheese sauce comes out runny (it thickens up in the oven)\n-some chili powder works well in the sauce\n-I'm betting a little sauteed onion would add some great flavor",
