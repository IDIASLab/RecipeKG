I do not like imitation crabmeat at all.. does not taste anything like blue crab! It is a bit more expensive but I used real blue crab meat (claw meat). I used the oven ready noodles and had no problems. I also mixed two small cans of cream of mushroom soup into the Alfredo sauce to add more mushroom flavor. I did not use cottage cheese since my husband is not a fan of that. I also used mozzarella cheese on each layer on top of the ricotta cheese. He loves it! This recipe is excellent on a cold night and for anyone who enjoys eating blue crab!!",

I dont know if that made a difference but they came out perfectly. I added 1 8oz jar of lump crab meat. Also i cooked mine for 2 hrs and 15 minutes well because i misread the cooking time. It still came out great. I put everything together at the same time. I didn't wait to add the cheese and it still was good. I waited for 45 minutes for it to cool instead of 30 minutes then i ate it. It was really really good. I seasoned the crab meat prior to cooking and i chopped the mushrooms up into small pieces to make sure they cooked like someone suggested.",

This really requires a larger style crock pot. I used a crock pot liner in my medium crock pot and had to move the liner to the larger one. Another issue was I felt it really needed extra sauce. Also upon reading the reviews I was unsure about the noodles to use dry pre-cook or use oven ready ones. I chose the oven ready type and found the texture chewy all the way through. I would use regular boiled noodles. I was not sure how to fix the noodle issue. 2 pieces were eaten and the rest could not be salvaged. This recipe may work if the right noodles are used.",

I used only 8 oz of lasagna noodles but 16 oz of crabmeat. Also next time I'd chop mushrooms smaller sliced mushrooms didn't have time to finish cooking. I don't mind mushrooms crunchy or chewy but for guests I would cut them up smaller. Overall it was very tasty and light.",

I wasn't sure if I was to cook the noodles or not as it wasn't stated, so I cooked them just enough to be pliable. I used sliced baby Bella's (8 oz package) and then diced the slices per a previous review suggestion. I also used a full container of ricotta and a full container of cottage cheese, mixed them together and spread them that way. I sprinkled some garlic powder and salt as I was worried it may be a little bland....it was AWESOME!!! Very very good and definitely will make this again. Note that it s hard to get out of the crockpot, as it becomes juicy, but definitely worth it.",

I did wait to add the cheese til the end and I am glad I did the cheese browned which was surprising. Will make again the family enjoyed it. Maybe an addition of red pepper flakes next time!",
