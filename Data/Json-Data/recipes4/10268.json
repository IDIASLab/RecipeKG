Next time I will cut the eggplant a tad bigger - maybe a little bigger then the size of dice - I also added chopped banana pepper & jalopeno to the rest of the batch (I made double right off the bat).  I made patties and fried them in a LITTLE olive oil in a skillet on the stove.  This is a great base to make your own veggie burgers - I will be adding waterchestnuts, chopped onion, shredded carrots.  Can't wait until I make meatballs.\r\nThis recipe is going to be a big hit at family gatherings!",

I left out the egg.  I formed the mashed eggplant into 1/4\" patties and baked on a lightly greased cookie sheet per the original instructions.  They are incredible!  Far more than I hoped for and we'll be making this dish often.  Served with a side of pasta and marinara sauce.  Leftovers, if there are any, would be great cold in a pita sandwich.",

These were ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!  i didn't even have the time to refrigerate them at all, but agree that it would only make for an improvement if i had.  i peeled the skin off, because of preference, and mashed them after steaming (you need to stir them every few minutes) and only baked them for twenty minutes because i finshed cooking them in my pot of sauce.  My husband and his male friends (sorry to be stereotypical) preferred them to my meatballs!  I can't wait to make them into a veggie burger, too!!  This recipe will live on in my family.",
