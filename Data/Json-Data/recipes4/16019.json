I halved the garlic and black pepper, omitted the salt, used a bag of coleslaw mix and 2 ten ounce cans of tomato soup with 3 cups of water. I added onion powder, garlic powder, Mrs Dash garlic & herb and a bay leaf. I did not boil the cabbage seperately, after the beef and onions were browned I added the rest of the ingredients, brought to a boil, then lowered to a simmer for an hour. My family enjoyed it! \n#AllrecipesAllstarsCanada\n#FacelessNoMore",
