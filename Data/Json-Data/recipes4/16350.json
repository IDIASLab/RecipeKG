So I came to A/R to find a recipie to make them and this was the only one! I was very skeptical about it. I love to cook but am no expert. This recipie calls for Marsalla wine. I've used that with pork and chicken, but never beef. I also don't personally  recall using tarragon in a beef dish before either. Well, I did both of these things with this recipie and it is FANTASTIC!! My family agreed and thought it was gourmet. I served it with butter/parsley red potatoes and steamed green beans. You must try this one!! The only variances I made was the addition of fresh garlic. I rarely make a dish without it! Also I transfered everything to a baking dish and covered it with foil before placing in the oven because I had 5 shanks and my skillet although oven proof was not large enough for all of them.  Thank you for sharing this! We will be eating these more often.",

If using organic grass-fed beef shanks from local farmer (truly clean meat), I would check it an our early just in case. There was a lot of liquid left over so I drained and froze it for the 2nd time I made the recipe and then I only had to add 1/2 of the liquid ingredients. It may be ready sooner. This did not effect the delicious result in the least.  LOVE!",
