I would recommend first stir frying the shrimp and set aside. do not marinate the shrimp because mine got mushy. I pretty much used the same recipe but I didnt have chili paste so i substituted 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes. I added some shrooms. I stirfried veggies, then added cooked shrimp and the sauce mixture. For the sauce mixture I reduced garlic to 2 teaspoons because I thought it would be too much. I recommend reducing the ginger to 1 teaspoon because it was too gingering and made my mouth tingle. So I basically used the same recipe except reduced the garlic and ginger and substituted red pepper flakes for the chili paste. Very flavorful and will make it again.",

First I only had raw shrimp so instead of marinating I just sauteed the veggies first and set aside then sauteed the shrimp with the sauce until almost cooked through and added veggies back in. Also I just had brown rice so cooked that per usual. Great recipe- will definitely make again!",
