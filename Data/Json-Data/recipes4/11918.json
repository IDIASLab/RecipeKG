After some trial and error, I came up with this. My family and friends now demand that it be on the menu for gatherings - even if it doesn't go with the course! Can be made in advance. The amount of heat is determined by the amount of chili garlic sauce used.",

I used 6 cloves of garlic I minced(not minced from a jar ever) 4 green onions an additional tsp. fresh ginger and a 1/2 tsp of dry crushed red pepper...also I used twice the amount of soy sauce(low sodium). I prepared the ingredients beforehand and put them each in a small bowl and first time I made the spicy beans served them over brown rice....if you want the\"sauce\" to be \"soupier\" add a bit more water....I forgot that I also added a tsp of sugar as well! LOVE this...might try it next time with ground turkey or chicken!!! Definitely a main dish...but key is ONLY fresh spices and good quality ingredients...garlic chili pastes come in a huge variety at a higher end grocery...don't have to shop at a specialty Asian store.",

I was looking for something close to what is served at the wonderful Chinese restaurant my husband and I have been going to on date night since our first date and this is pretty close!:-) I use two chicken breasts cut into very small pieces (instead of the pork) coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and increase the sauce proportions (1.5 to double depending on the size of the chicken breasts). Chef Rita hit it -- the blistering of the beans is the key and the sauce is super yummy. It's a huge hit any time I make this!",

The other thing that is great about this recipe is that it didn't require me to buy any additional spice ingredients. Thanks for sharing.",
