I followed the recipe almost exactly except: I used 3 tablespoons of cornstarch as we like a thick stir fry 3 tablespoons of soy sauce for more flavor and substituted vegetable broth for the beef broth. I also sauteed the mushrooms with the green peppers and onions. I assume that they were added later in the recipe as they were already prepared or canned. We served this over rice and it was so tasty! Thanks KACharles for a great recipe.",
