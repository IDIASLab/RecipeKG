Get a bunch of 10\" flour tortillas since it is hard to say how many you will need.  I sauteed portabella and crimini mushrooms with onion and garlic plus a few spices \"du jour\", also doubled the spinach and used 2% cheese of my choice.  Later I did the same thing with chicken and no spinach.  These are the same sauteed ingredients of many pasta dishes. I folded giant spinach tortilla's in half and cooked them in my panini press.  I packaged up two of the spinach quesadillas with two chicken/vegetable ones in aluminum foil to freeze.  A couple minutes in the toaster oven (which I don't own?), or just thawed and it's instant finger food.  Dice anything you like, cook it anyway you like, then put it in between a couple tortillas (I like flour or whole wheat or spinach or...), and it's either a snack, a meal or party food.  How fun is that?",
