That being said I did not have a can of prepared chili so I used a can of chili beans the whole can of tomato sauce and extra chili powder in its place. I also used venison in place of the ground beef. Chorizo is so greasy that I recommend draining the meat mixture before adding it to the slow cooker. This recipe could very easily be done on the stove top as well if you needed dinner on the table in less than an hour.",

I left out the \"prepared chili\" used a can of chopped chillis 2 cans of black beans instead of 1 can of butter beans 14oz can of diced tomatoes and 14oz of crushed tomatoes (didn't have any tomato sauce) threw in some chopped bell peppers to add some more bulk and I didn't bother pre-cooking anything. Cranked it up to high for 5 hours and everything was cooked perfectly! Very thick and hearty - we loved it over some rice. Fits well into a 5qt slow cooker.",

But the second version we ENHANCED with the addition of some GHOST PEPPER and CAROLINA REAPER hot sauces. And I might add the 2nd version with the hot sauces added was the FIRST BATCH TO GO!! Our guests that evening LOVED IT! So I definitely recommend THIS recipe if you have the time and the patience. Oh and just to be sure- YES I DEFINITELY will be making this recipe again! It might even become my \"official\" go-to chili recipe! Thanks Allrecipes- job WELL DONE!",
