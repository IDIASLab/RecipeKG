I used a mini food processor to get a creamy smooth texture which I preferred to the small curds version. I tried it 3 ways: as written; with 1/3 less butter and with yogurt instead of butter. The yogurt version's consistency was more liquid & lacked the rich taste of butter. It was still VERY good in its own right though. An excellent & healthy alternative for those who want/need to reduce butter consumption. The other 2 ways were so similar in taste & texture that I'd make this again with only half the butter. We tasted it as recipe was written; all of us really liked the fresh herby taste. Later I added more cilantro & jalapeno for stronger flavor. I agree with Josephine that this could accompany a Greek meal or any Middle Eastern meal for that matter (especially if yogurt is used for some or all of the butter).",

My husband bought large curd cottage cheese so I had to add milk to make it less chuncky. Also I only used 1/4 jalapeno because 4 and 1 year old were eating it too. Lastly I added a squirt of lemon. Wonderful dish! Although its not Greek I think this would be a lovely addition to my Greek themed meals. Thank you Traci B for sharing such a unique recipe.

That's the only change I made. We are definitely dill fans and the dill flavor was very refreshing. I don't do hot so I made two versions. One as written with a mild amount of minced jalapeno pepper and the second dish had only a slight amount. Since more of the spicier version was eaten I think my guests may have perferred the spicier one. I put the spread in the center of my Lazy Susan and around it I placed triangles and other shapes of a variety of very flavorful breads. I used Dill Rye Sundried tomato & Basil bread Smoked Swiss cheese bread. I had bread sticks pita triangles and several kinds of crackers. The spread has almost a summery back yard taste. This certainly is a keeper for our family.",
