And yes it hardens and is shiny, but it is not a royal icing.  It has a category of its own.  Also it doesn't dry and harden as quickly.  It's all I ever used to use....It tastes better than most royal icings and that is a plus.  But for fine detail that holds it shape better...the royal icing wins.  On taste...the glaze wins hands down.",
