Caoted with cooking spray...easy. I added french onion soup mix to the beef because I wasn't in the mood to chop onions. Lastly since we were hungry and I had two hungry babies I skipped out on the bechamel all together. Just sprinkled feta cheese. I'm sure the sauce would have made the recipe but I decided that it would be healthier for now anyways! I was pleased to find this recipe on an ingredient search. Ive wanted to try the moussaka at our local family restaurant for quite sometime-now I HAVE to try it!",

I used only 2 lg eggplant, no zucchini.\nVegetable Changes:I sliced the eggplant in to 1/4 in slices, spritzed with olive  oil spray and baked in a 400 oven for 10 minutes on a parchment lined pan.  I boiled the potato slices for 4 minutes.  \nBechamel was good and only change I made was way more than a pinch of nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon is more like it.\nMeat/Sauce changes:  Peeled the tomatoes.  Added 1 t cinnamon, 1/4 t ground allspice, and a pinch of ground clove.  Added two cloves of garlic, minced to the sautee.  Omitted parsley because I didnt feel like going back to the garden and my son brought me cilantro by mistake when I sent him.  Added 1 T tomato paste and a 1/4 c red wine.  I thought sauce looked runny so I thickened with a slurry of 2T water and 2 t cornstarch.  WIth my changes it is a 5 stars.  \nIt makes an enormous quantity, but that is OK because it freezes well.  I took the leftovers, and chilled in fridge.  I cut into serving size slabs and wrapped in a double layer of wax paper.  Shoved all the wrapped slabs in a labelled ziploc bag.   Now I have excellent lunches to go.  Take a slab to work and it defrost in time to heat nicely in a microwave.",

I brushed the veggies with olive oil and baked them in the oven at 375 degrees instead of grilling them. Each vegetable had a different cook time for me so I would recommend monitoring and poking around a little to assess when the vegetables are soft to your liking. My final product included some water at the bottom of my baking dish but this did not translate to a watery moussaka. The sauce was super creamy and the feta was a delicious touch.
