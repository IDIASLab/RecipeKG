I made this for just the two of us with half a pound of really good shrimp and fusilli rather than rotini (what I had on hand).  I did add a little of my lemon olive oil and a touch of pecorino and romano parmesan to the pasta before putting the shrimp mixture on top.  Otherwise, I followed your directions.  I had to Google the difference between feta and goat cheese earlier today because I had feta on hand.  That led me to go out to Sprouts to buy the goat cheese, and I'm so glad I did because it is not as salty and just kind of melts into the dish as you start to stir it around to eat it.  Yum!  The tomatoes I used were from Sprouts--fire roasted diced tomatoes, and the artichoke hearts are my favorite Trader Joe's (not as salty as others).  This was totally excellent.  I'll be hard pressed not to have some for breakfast in the morning (we have to wait for leftovers tomorrow night)!  Thanks again!  EDIT:  PS  Leftovers were excellent!",

Loved the fresh taste of the tomatoes - used Walmart brand \"no salt added petite diced\" and recommend them (I only found them because of this dish, so I'm thankful!) Next time, I will mix the pasta into the shrimp & sauce plus add the cheese & stir it in, as mine didn't melt enough to spread over the whole serving when it was \"scattered\" on. Oh, and I didn't have \"marinated\" artichokes, but the plain were fine with the seasonings in the dish.  You should try this - you'll like it if you like the ingredients. Served it with Chef John's (excellent) garlic rolls and green bean/carrot/mushroom recipe from this site, and started the dinner with the 24 hour salad as seen here.  Great meal that will be repeated!",

Instead I added frozen peas and spinach after browning the garlic and green onion. I then added about a 1/3 cup of white wine and cooked it down with the veggies. Then I added the tomato and cooked that down removed it from the pan then sauteed the shrimp with salt and pepper in a little olive oil. Once cooked through I returned the sauce with veggies to the pan then added about a 1/3 lb of cooked aldente penne pasta to the sauce and tossed it in the pan with the heat on for a few minutes to let the flavor set in the pasta. The capers and chipotle was perfect just the way it was. I topped it with Pecorino Romano cheese. I thought I was taking a risk with the peas but it was awesome. This only took 20 minutes total!
