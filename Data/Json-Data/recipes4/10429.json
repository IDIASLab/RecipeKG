Add the other half of the butter then the flour to make the roux.  The best way to make a good roux is to use a whisk.  Then, add the water and beef bouillon and continue to whisk until desired color and consistency.  If the onions are finely chopped and cooked for the right amount of time, you don't even notice them in the gravy - they just melt away.",

I used 2 cups water to four boullion cubes, which worked perfectly.  Added black pepper to taste, along with some Worcestershire for color and flavor.  Make sure you make the roux first (cook the butter and flour together) so it will start to brown, then add the onions and the other ingredients.",
