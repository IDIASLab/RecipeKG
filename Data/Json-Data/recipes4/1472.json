They pushed the lid up and made them not cook as well. Second time I used a deep frying pan and the recipe was much better for it. It allowed the biscuit to cook better. They came out somewhere between a fully cooked biscuit and a dumpling. I used a 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce and sprinkled the top with shredded cheddar cheese. This is a really popular recipe now in my house. Absolutley wonderful!!!",

Baked about 15 min at 375 then just shut off the oven and let it set for a while...also added s&P a dash of hot sauce steak sauce ketchup and a little br sugar. nothing special or exciting but didn't claim to be...this is a great \"I worked lated and I'm POOPED\" dinner:) excellent!",

I used kc materpiece original bbq sauce and added more than the recipe called for to, which made it more saucy and \"gravy like\" instead of just ground beef and bean mixture. I baked my biscuits according to package directions so they would get brown and to make sure they were cooked through. My fiance LOVED this dish!! He made sure I saved the recipe and has already asked me to make it next week!! It was super simple!! One thing I also added was salt pepper and garlic powder to my onion and beef mix when it was browning up, just adding a little more flavor but like I said this was amazing and easy, I loved it and will definitely be making again!!",
