I can't believe how great it tastes. I've never had a chickpea dish with flavors this rich -- and without any fatty coconut milk. My substitutions: I used a lot (roughly 2T) of garam masala instead of the spices listed here since it's a comparable blend and dried cranberries for half of the raisins (didn't seem to make much a difference). -- yum! Next time I might double the sweet potato or even add butternut squash. So tasty and fragrant -- My boyfriend said it smells like Christmas in here.",

The yams pears and raisins add a nice sweetness-- but it's not overly sweet. It packs quite a punch though so if you don't like it spicy cut down on the cayenne. I used a 32oz. container of vegetable broth from the store instead of the boullion and forgot to include the cilantro but it turned out lovely. The dish was great paired with naan bread. Definitely a keeper!",

The flavor was mild but still very tasty. I think next time I will add more cayenne.",
