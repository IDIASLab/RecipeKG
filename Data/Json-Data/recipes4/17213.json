BUT the multiple studies and reliable sources that FO \nAs most others have said, this is good.  I do change the directions just a bit. I roast the bones, and use the ingredients. But I place just the roasted bones in the crock pot with the vinegar and water (DOMETIMES unsalted, or lower sodium beef stock from a  carton). I them let that cook for 12 to 16 hours. Then I add in the veggies for another hr or so till those are soft and quite tender. I find that cooking g the veggies for  the whole time just is overkill, and begins to change the flavor in a less than appetizing way. Even though  it all gets tossed out anyway, b/c all nutrients in those ingredients have given all they had.The taste is better if you don't stew the veggies beyond  well done.",
