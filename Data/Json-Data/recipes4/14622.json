Can easily be prepared in advance, then popped in the oven for a nice hot meal.  If making for the first time, add half of the sour cream and taste first. Add more if desired, tasting as you go, to reach desired flavor. Serve over cooked white rice.",

I used one soup can size of chicken broth, 3 cups of water with added chicken bouilon cubes, 2, I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup with a 16 oz container of sour cream.I had vegetable flavored ritz crackers and used 4 tbls of melted butter. By the way these crackers are good. I made rice and brocolli on the side and they spooned the chicken casserole over the rice. Very, very good!! My husband really enjoyed it and my daughter had 2 helpings. I loved it also. Thank you for a gret recipe!",

I didn't modify it much - I used a little less sour cream based on comments that it was too much and even with just 2c of sour cream with the large can of cream of chicken soup it definitely would have been too much - it was quite soupy even with reducing the sour cream! I added onion & garlic to the soup mix. I think next time I'd like to add celery too. We served this over noodles - I had wanted to serve it over mashed potatoes but I didn't have enough potatoes to make that work out - but serving over noodles was great (my DH has a pasta addiction so he was thrilled lol). We'll have this again:)",
