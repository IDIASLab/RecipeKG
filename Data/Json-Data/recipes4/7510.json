The Greek seasoning I had to find on this site by another reviewer. Added that after I browned the beef. It was delicious! My mistake was adding a can of diced tomatoes to it since I didn't have plum tomatoes or sauce. It changed the flavor dramatically! It was okay according to my husband but will try again without tomatoes. The Greek seasoning made this recipe.",

I added the seasoning to the meat as it browned, along with the juice of one lemon. I realized at this point that my meat chunks were too big so I took them out of the pan, poured out the drippings, cut the meat into smaller pieces, then added them back to the pan along with a couple splashes of italian dressing. Once the meat was browned, I removed it from the pan and sauteed the onions in the new drippings. I also added about 2 tbsp of greek dressing that was leftover from a takeout meal. I had 1/2 a green bell pepper left in the fridge, so I chopped it up and threw half of them in at this point. After the onions and peppers were soft, I added 3 cloves of garlic, minced, and more of my \"almost\" greek seasoning mix. Then I added the beef back to the pan and poured in enough low sodium beef broth to just cover the beef (about 2 1/2 cups). After the hour and 15 minutes, I added the rest of the chopped green pepper and 1 1/2 cups sliced baby carrots along with the celery and two 10.5 oz bags of shredded cabbage. I needed a to add a little more liquid at this point, but didn't have anymore beef broth, so I used about 3/4 cup chicken stock because that's all I had on hand. Had to let it simmer for 45 minutes instead of 30 so the carrots could soften a little more. With the 8 oz can of tomato sauce, I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes wi",

I also used 16 oz of shredded cabbage (which happened to be cole slaw mix so a bit of carrot in it) to use the whole package and a 16 oz can of fire roasted diced tomatoes. I increased the Greek seasoning to 2 tsp and used additional broth (I think due to additional cabbage it needed extra broth which diluted the original seasoning measurement). I also cooked the celery and onion in the runoff from browning the beef and then added tomatoes and everything but cabbage in the beginning to allow the onions tomatoes and seasonings time to combine flavors. I cooked on low simmer for an hour then added cabbage. I cooked a little longer than instructed just because I had time which allowed broth to reduce and thicken a bit which intensified flavor.
