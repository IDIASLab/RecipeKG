We're from N.J. but we're a grits lovin' family and I must tell you that my kids went HOG WILD over this dish! I'm not into processed anything, so I finely grated a good cheddar/parm cheese and it worked out great. Certainly a combination that I would never have thought of and with a good splash from the hot sauce bottle, we had a delicious meal in under thirty minutes. Thanks a heap J.D.!!!!",
