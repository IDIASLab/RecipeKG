My salmon fillet was thicker than typical but was almost done when I flipped it and was certainly done less than three minutes later and by then the asparagus was over cooked. I would suggest not adding the asparagus until flipping the salmon - and do that much sooner than called for. Also 1/4 cup olive oil is way too much. I used it but next time would use closer to 1 Tablespoon. And 1 1/2 cups cream yields way too much sauce for the salmon and pasta. I used about 3/4 cup and that was more than enough. As written the recipe yields an overcooked heavy dish. With some tweaks to make it lighter and fresher it could be great.",
