I blended 4 peppers ( from 1 can) 1/4 cup of the chipotle juice 4 table spoons honey doubled up on the worcestershire sauce and made a paste.. then I mixed this with a dark beer ( the only one i had was a dark beer). I marinated the pork in 1/4 the sauce.. just enough to coat the 2 loins for 1 hour. Pan seared all sides.. on a really hot pan and then placed onions carrots small red potatoes in the pan with loins on top.. i poured over the remaining juice over the loins on the bed of veggies and covered with tin foil.. 350 for 35 min.. then uncovered for 10 and broiled for 5.. let rest for 15 min and it was delicious!!",

Unless you were to remove all seeds and that would have been an arduous task due to the sauce. I also questioned to myself the temp and time. 375 degrees for 90 minutes??? My pork tenderloins came out tough as tough can be. I was extremely disappointed. I would lower oven temp and time and change to 1 can of chipotle and 2 cans of mild chili's. Next time!!!",

After marinating for about an hour we grilled the tenderloins (indirect heat) rather than roasting. Heat from the chipotle was just right but the flavor was only ok. I think the beer watered the marinade down too much. Will likely use this recipe again as a starting point for tweaking and experimenting.",
