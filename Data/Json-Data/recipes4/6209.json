Freezes well and dough can be made a day or two ahead. These are good plain, or you can melt some chocolate chips (milk, semi-sweet, or white) and dip one end of the cookie. You can then dip the chocolate end in chopped nuts, crushed candy canes, coconut, jimmies, or decorating sugar. Or, add a little grated orange peel or chopped candied ginger to the chocolate when you melt it for another great flavor. Place on waxed paper to harden.",
