After they were browned I transfered them to my slow cooker and topped them w/ a jar of pasta sauce (omitting the water). I set the slow cooker to low and allowed them to cook for 8 hours. These smelled soooo good while cooking and they were perfectly moist tender and delicious...literally fall-off-the-bone DELICIOUS! When my mom makes her homemade pasta sauce she always browns some country ribs and lets them cook in the sauce for flavor...then we get to eat them. This reminded me of that and that was just what I was looking for (don't tell her but mine were even more moist and tender lol)! I will def make these again just like I did today!
