I love that the ingredients are minimal and there's no need to run out and buy so many little things.\n\nSo I made this so quickly - instead of chopping up onions and garlic I just used some green seasoning...Caribbeans/latinos will know what this is. Basically it's a seasoning made of ground onions and peppers and various green herbs that we keep handy in the fridge for marinades and sofritos and cooking.  I sauteed some of that in olive oil until fragrant and added diced zucchini and spinach. Just before it was cooked I added a pinch of tumeric. This makes the cauliflower less bland and gives the quiche a yellowish tinge like it has yolks. Then I followed the rest of the recipe and baked it in a old time Corningware dish because I couldn't find the pie pan and it was savory and delicious! Thanks!",
