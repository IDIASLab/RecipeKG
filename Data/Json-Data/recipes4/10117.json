Like other people have said, I also made some changes to suit my tastes, and I actually like the fact that this recipe seems so versatile.   First, I made the dough for the crust with half whole wheat and half all purpose flour, and I used a heart healthy light margarine instead of butter. I reduced the amount of olive oil sightly, added some fresh chopped garlic, used only two potatoes, and added some cauliflower and carrots. I chose to use (pre-soaked) green lentils 'cause they're the \"beefiest\" lentils ;) I also seasoned with a splash of Worcestershire sauce, mild garlic Tabasco sauce, and some pinches of oregano, marjoram, sage, and thyme. Brilliant!!!",

I found the filling to be very starchy and dry the first time I made it following the directions exactly so I made some changes the second time. I followed some of the other review's suggestions about reducing potato (I only ended up using one) and adding peas and carrots- I boiled 1/2 cup dry split peas and 1/4 cup chopped carrot in 4 cups of water for 15 minutes, then added the lentils and boiled for another 30 minutes. I also added about 3 cloves of garlic to the onion saute. The dough was excellent, but it was too wet at first and I had to knead more flour into it. The second time I added the water gradually and didn't use all of it.\nNext time I will probably cut up a potato, rinse it a few times to decrease the amount of starch, and then boil it instead of baking it. I might bake some cheddar into it as well. I think there is a lot of potential to this recipe but even with the flavors I tried to add the second time it was still pretty dry.",

I made my filling by boiling the lentils in chicken broth using seasoned salt and pepper instead of salt and adding peas and corn. I also brushed them with egg whites before baking and they were very good- but next time I may try freezing them individually before baking so I can have them freshly cooked when I want them. The crust is perfect though so I will enjoy making these again and trying to find a way to keep the filling more moist(or perhaps I will just serve with gravy as some other reviewers mentioned).
