For my personal preference, I simmered the soup a lot longer (about 15 minutes with the lid off to concentrate the flavor, and then about 20 minutes with the lid on) because even with the tough ribs removed, the kale took a while to become tender.  Additionally, I always cook any soups and pasta sauces ahead of time so the flavors can develop overnight.  It truly makes a big difference, and it's a nice to treat to have lunch or dinner made in advance!  Thanks for the great recipe.",

I cooked the onions and garlic first and then added the spices and veggies.  I used imagine vegetable broth which is an excellent broth.  Then I cooked it in the pressure cooker for 10 min and so the kale is really soft and all the flavors infused through the soup.  I have never blended beans for soup before and gave that a try and really felt it added something to the soup.  I think it makes it more substantial. I also added a tbsp of fresh lemon juice at the end. My vegetarian daughter is thrilled with this and so am I.",
