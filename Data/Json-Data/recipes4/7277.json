I only used an 1/8 teaspoon of black pepper as some of the family have sensitive stomachs. I added perhaps one or two tablespoons of water so there would be enough moisture to create steam to poach the fish when the lid was placed on the pan. I'll be making this again and again! UPDATE: I made this for a second time poaching as before. This time I sprinkled the dry spices over the salmon and drizzled a bit of maple on each filet. I skipped the oil entirely and everyone liked it even better than last time. It's my new \"impress the company\" recipe!",
