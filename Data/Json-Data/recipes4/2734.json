I only had a two pound roast so I halved the recipe but next time I would use the entire jar of pepperoncini peppers not half. I also did not have beef bouillon cubes so I sprinkled bouillon inside the cuts before inserting the garlic. I would also decrease the bouillon next time; my roast was salty enough with the Worcestershire sauce and italian dressing mix. In summary increase the pepperoncini peppers (not juice) and decrease the bouillon (salt). Will definitely make again!!!!",
