Before putting the crumbs on the chicken I lightly rubbed a little ranch dressing on the chicken. Other than the fact that my almonds were sliced rather than slivered I did follow the recipe. This was a very nice dinner and I'll have leftovers for lunch today! Thanks Linda Rutko!",

A little too \"ranchy\" for my own tastes since it calls for an entire bottle of dressing... Likely will substitute a can of soup for a cup of the ranch next time. I just used a small bag of chips and it probably could've used two. The almonds tasted good but I'd slice them or chop them up more so it goes with the gooey delicious mess that is the casserole. Girlfriend enjoyed it and thought it was pretty decent too. Will try again with modification.",
