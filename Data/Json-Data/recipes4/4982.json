The recipe sounds so easy and delicious, and so it is! The making was mess-free, I used the smallest cookie cutter I had, and transferred the crackers to the parchment with a butter knife to avoid breaking them. They turned out beautifully crispy and golden (the ones rolled thinnest were the best), and the backgound wiff of cayenne pepper complimented ever so delicately to the aroma and taste. Mmmm... Will make again. And again.",

I doubled the cayenne pepper and they are delicious! I think next time I'll try using less butter to cut fat and calories. I also added a little milk because the dough was dry at first. A tip for rolling them- if you don't mind how they look I placed the dough on the baking sheet (no parchment paper just oil/non stick spray) and smashed it as flat as I could with my hands. Then I put plastic wrap on top of it and rolled it to avoid having the dough stick to the roller. After it was flat (remember it's already on the baking sheet) I cut them into little squares. I also dashed salt on them like real Cheese Nips. After they were baked and a little crispy I retraced the lines with the knife and voila little square cheese nips! Even though I changed the recipe a bit they are delicious and now with the added benefit of wheat flour!",

Both are common and cheap grocery store shelf staples. I decided to make a 1/2 recipe to try it. They really did taste like Cheese Nips from the grocery store. The texture was a little harder like a homemade cracker but the taste was similar. I only had whipped dairy butter and low fat cheese, but they ended up working with no problem. My issue, I have with the recipe, is I made only 1/2 recipe but it still took 2 hours to make. It was really time consuming to roll just the one ball of dough out repeatedly to 1/8\" thick and cut small crackers out of it. A regular cookie cutter, although quicker, would have been way too big. I broke the dough into 4 pieces to work with it and rolled it on a plastic cutting board. I didn't need the extra flour to roll it out. I ended up yielding about 1 1/2 cups of small crackers. They did taste better than expected, just a lot of work, but fun to try to make anyway.",

(I'm potty training a 2-year old don't have time to be in the kitchen.) I did it in two steps. First combine the ingredients and threw the dough in a zip lock bag and put in the refrigerator. (That took 10mins tops!) Second when my son was taking his nap I rolled out the dough used cookie cutters and popped it in the oven. (2 large cookie sheets made all the crackers.) So that was 30mins of baking. In my opinion they were amazing but the son didn't like them. I wouldn t say they were hot but the crackers do have a little kick 2 seconds after you eat it. (Enough kick that they son spit it out and wanted a drink.) I made a second batch for him using regular pepper instead of cayenne pepper. I also ran out of real butter and used spreadable butter. FOLLOW THE RECIPE! Don t substitute the butter! Instead of being crisp/flaky they are chewy. They are still edible but they just don t have the cracker texture.",
