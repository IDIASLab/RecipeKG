As is, this recipe gets 4 stars. The chicken mixture is a little bland, and I prefer more toppings (olives, jalapenos, etc.) on my nachos. \n\nMy tips and changes for the perfect chicken nachos (according to my tastes, at least):\n\n1. Use rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, or cook your own chicken breast first. Do NOT use canned chicken or the pre-cooked, packaged chicken chunks! They give it a weird flavour and don't shred as nicely.\n\n2. Shred, don't chop, the chicken. It's so much smoother and melt-in-your-mouth-y this way.\n\n3. Add taco seasoning (or your own blend of spices) to the onions while you saute them. Use a lot so it coats the chicken when you add it.\n\n4. Along with the chicken, stir in some rinsed canned black beans and some frozen corn kernels (don't need to thaw). Don't use a \"southwestern-style\" salsa that has these ingredients included, as I found that it didn't provide the texture contrast you get from using canned beans or the bites of sweetness you get from frozen corn.\n\n5. Pre-bake the tortilla chips ~5min before adding the chicken mixture so the chips stay crispy.\n\n6. Add more toppings! I add sliced black olives and lots of sliced jalapenos along with the tomatoes. Sometimes I will also toss on some diced green or red bell pepper for crunch.\n\nServe with sour cream for the perfect nachos!",

In addition to the shredded cheeses I decided to go all the way and also make a cheese sauce using cheddar and pepper jack. I don't like soggy nachos so I baked the chips by themselves to really crisp them up and then put the meat mixture on top added the cheese and served. This is the FIRST time I've ever seen hubby eat nachos. Delicious Laura!",

I used montery pepper jack cheese and some cheddar.  I added black olives for flavor and color.  All my friends raved and wanted the recipe!  I even saved a small plate for the next day and it was still delicious warmed up in the oven.  Thanks for a recipe I will use often!",

                "reviewBody": "Good recipe but not worth 5 Stars because so many changes are needed. First thing cover the baking sheet with foil and spray with Pam for easier serving and clean-up. Rather than season the chicken I addes taco mix to refried beans (heated). Used Organic chips with added flax (healthier and more fiber) first layer a light dusting of cheese to keep chips from getting soggy then warmed chicken then drop warmed beans by spoonful all over then sprinkled with corn (adds texture and a touch of sweetness) and more shredded cheese. Because everything has been pre-heated you can put in broiler for 1-2 min. this will lightly toast the chips and keep everything from being soggy. I pull the foil right off the sheet and put on a platter and dollop with salsa chopped avocado or guacamole and sour cream to make it special. Serve with a side of limes to squeeze on top if wanted and caesar salad for a nice meal.",
