I am from NM so I have chile running through my veins..lol. I always have NM roasted green chile in my freezer...so I added about 4-5 chopped green chiles and the result was wonderful!

These have great flavor but I do recommend cutting back on the jalapeno peppers if you want to be able to taste that great flavor instead of tasting what a tongue engulfed in flames tastes like. Again excellent flavor and we do like hot but I will scale down on the peppers a bit next time. Thanks for the great recipe Flyineggbeater!",

I've seen a lot of people talk about how this dish is too hot and I have to disagree. PLEASE NOTE: Peppers are a subjective ingredient in ANY recipe and THE AMOUNT MUST BE ADJUSTED TO TASTE. If you DO NOT like a lot of heat try substituting green chiles with 1-2 chopped and seeded jalapenos. Also note that THERE ARE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF JARRED JALAPENOS. Try finding ones labeled as mild pickled or seeded to reduce the heat. To me and my family jalapenos are more tangy than hot and we usually add in some additional chipotles with adobo.",
