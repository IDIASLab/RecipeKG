After browning the meat in a skillet, I threw everything in the crockpot and cooked on low for 7 hours. The meat was very tender. The colcannon was delicious. I made the entire dish ahead of time and microwaved it when we were ready to eat. The stew and colcannon combination is really good together. The adults loved it and my kids ate it without complaints!",

This is so delicious. I used 4 cloves of garlic because I love it, and since I had ground thyme instead of dried leaves, used 1/2 tsp. When browning the meat, I salted and peppered the meat to impart flavor throughout the cooking process, but still added the salt and pepper called for later in the recipe. For the colcannon, I used about 3 times the milk called for. These changes are all minor, and I would trust this recipe over and over! It's wonderful! Can't wait to eat it again, and I'm still finishing my plate. :) **Update: Don't use Guinness! I used Guinness the 2nd time I made this and the bitterness was overwhelming for my 2lbs of meat and really ruined the dish for me. Using a less bitter beer is the way to go.",

I also only had a pound of stewing beef so decided to try something completely different - I added about a pound of boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into cubes. Used red cabbage instead of green because that's what I had in the fridge. Gave the potatoes a unique colour. Overall the flavour of the whole meal was superb - especially the potato cabbage bacon combination. And like others I did not cook the cabbage in the microwave - I sauteed it a bit in the bacon pan. Definitely a keeper! (My mouth is watering just thinking of this dinner - we had it last night and I could eat it again tonight but alas no leftovers!)",

I did brown the meat and coat it in flour as the recipe directs but then I put all ingredients in the slow cooker for 7 or 8 hrs on low. Perfect! Also didn't want to hear it from my critics about \"ruining\" their mashed potatoes with cabbage so I pureed the cooked cabbage and then blended it into the potatoes. It did have a very light green tint but I made no replys to the comments and no one was the wiser!:) I also held out the bacon pieces and let those who like bacon add it at the table. If everyone likes bacon I would definately not leave this out as it gave the colcannon a finishing touch. This is definately a keeper! Thank you for the great recipe.",

I have strained off the broth and I am trying to rescue it with beef broth and seasonings. This seems unfair to rate since it appears the beer is at fault. i have had several friends who made it and they loved it, but they did not use a bitter stout. Thanks for sharing.",
