Most of the ingredients used in this dish was bought either at Dollar Tree or Grocery Outlet. No italian sausage on hand but I did have a pound of ground beef. I sauteed one onion and a couple minced cloves of garlic in EVOO then added the meat. My boys aren't big on cottage cheese so I only used 12 oz. and I added another 14 oz. jar of Ragu. I tasted it and thought it needed a little something so I added a tsp. of Italian seasoning and a couple shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce. My boys and I ate the heck out of this. I love how you can make this casserole to suit your family. I served it with Parmesan Herb Bread which is also from this site. This recipe makes a lot so make sure you're hungry. I'd like to make this again and see if I can't cut back on the meat and use more fresh chopped veggies like carrots zucchini and spinach.",
