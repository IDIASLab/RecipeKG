Also - I did NOT drain the oil from the sun dried tomatoes the oil had a bunch of flavor. I used \"Garden\" style fettuccine rather than just spinach and it was great. Make sure you toss the noodles with a little oil before serving so they don't stick together in a big clump. The friends that I had over for dinner said that it tasted like it was from a restaurant.

Also I used a 1 1/2 T of cornstarch mixed with water to thicken the sauce instead of flour. The sauce when finished tasted a little bitter to me so I added 2 fresh basil leaves (its all I had) and some dried basil (didn't measure). I think the bitterness was from the brand of tomatoes I used. The sweetness from the basil helped to balance the bitterness. I used a Merlot for the wine. It was a really good dish. Also after you drain your pasta toss it with a little bit of olive oil so that it doesn't stick together into one mass clump when you serve it. Thanks for the recipe.",
