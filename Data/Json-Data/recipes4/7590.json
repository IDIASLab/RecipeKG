The dish is really not attractive to look at if you follow the directions since the sprinkled flour remains where it landed in small white clumps. The onion also remains semi-raw so there is no depth of flavor. The dish lacked the creamy sauce I was expecting from the name.\n\nIf I were to make it again, this is what I would do:\nInstead of layering as directed, use the butter (possibly a little more than directed) to cook the onions and some garlic in a frying pan.  When the onions are translucent, add the flour to make a roux. Then add the milk, salt, and paprika and cook until slightly thickened.  Pour 1/3 of sauce over each layer, then bake as directed.",

For an added layer of tasty goodness I thinly sliced a small onion and caramlized prior to adding to potato dish, plus I used more flour, salt, and paprika than originally called for. I used heavy cream in place of milk and added  1/2 lb hickory smoked ham, diced. I layered the potato dish in a 9x13\" pan to give more surface area for the crisping of top layer of potatoes, bc that's my favorite part. I was going to add shredded sharp cheddar cheese but this rich and creamy dish doesn't need it. Next time I make this dish I will slice potatoes thinner to lessen cooking time, be aware it takes a full hour plus to cook this dish perfectly. All in all- we loved the crispy potatoes on the top and the velevety perfectly cooked scalloped potatoes underneath, thank you to whomever posted this recipe, this is one dish I make repeatedly,",
