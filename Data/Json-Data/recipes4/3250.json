This dish is a comfort food for me and I am so enthused that I can make this successfully at home instead of trekking out and about for it. Here are a few alterations I tried: -Added 1 TBS peanut butter (all I had on hand was crunchy) 1/4 c. cashews and some freshly minced garlic to the chicken. -Substituted 4 stalks of chopped celery for the bell pepper. -Added more freshly minced garlic to the veggies. -Used sesame oil. -Substituted chili flakes for the hot pepper sauce. -Garnished with green onions. I chose to pair the dish with wilted green cabbage and bok choy (sesame oil garlic salt) and coconut jasmine rice. Yum yum! Happy eating! I impatiently wait for a hungry pocket to form in my belly so I can go back for seconds.",
