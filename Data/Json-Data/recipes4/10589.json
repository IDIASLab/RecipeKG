I made a few changes to the recipe and it came out tasting almost exactly like my regular cabbage rolls.  Here are the changes I made: I used 1-1/2 pounds of ground beef to make it a little meatier.  I used 1 (15.2 oz \"value size\") can of tomato soup, 1 (15 oz) can of tomato sauce and NO water.  I also added a can of drained diced tomatoes.  I boiled the sliced cabbage for about 5 minutes before adding it to the meat/onion/tomato mixture to help speed up the cooking time (and to help it all fit in my electric skillet).  For seasonings I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  I didn't add the sour cream.  I had some leftover cooked rice in the fridge, so right before serving I stirred in about a cup of that and heated it through.  YUM!",

I doubled the meat and the tomato soup did not use the sour cream. Without doubling the meat it was too much like soup. The only real problem is that the cabbage takes much longer to cook than the recipe calls for - it took at least an hour of simmering to get the cabbage tender enough.
