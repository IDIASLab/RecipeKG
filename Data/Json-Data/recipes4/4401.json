This will firstly prevent them from discoloration but will also rid the potatoes of excess starch so they roast up crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. To save my sanity cleaning the baking sheet, I first placed a layer of parchment paper down - cleanup's a snap. The best part of these potatoes was by far the parmesan. The potatoes were evenly coated and melted during roasting to form a crunchy, flavorful crust. My kids loved these! Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe!!",

I was all excited because as I was mixing the dish up the combination of the parmesan and the thyme smelled wonderful and it smelled heavenly when I was taking it out of the oven. But the taste simply wasn't as good as the smell unfortunately. The good thing about this recipe was that my two oldest boys ate it pretty good so they seemed to like it. The potatoes just tasted a little bland to me but maybe changing the grated cheese to shredded and maybe a couple more spices might give it the taste that it was lacking. I might have to try that! Again this was not a bad dish just not real exciting to eat. Thanks for the recipe Kristen!",
