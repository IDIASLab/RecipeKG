All other recipe notes were followed. There is enough liquid in this dish that it could easily be converted to a one dish meal by adding 2 cups of rice with the potatoes. Because it ends up more like a gravy than anything it would be lovely on biscuits. It was nice for dipping crescent rolls in! The rice only serves as a sauce delivery system here. I'd add more peppers next time - they got a bit lost in the cooking. Overall it was a crowd pleaser and a nice way to use frozen precooked leftover turkey legs!",
