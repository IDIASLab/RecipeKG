This is what adds lightness to the dough and you can't taste it at all - it is a chemical reaction you need to give you light fluffy waffles. Second keep the fat of your sour cream/yogurt in mind. Full fat will need more water added to the batter while low or fat free will need less water to get the right consistency. Also because I like my waffles this way I added 3 Tbsp of demerara sugar (i.e. Sugar in the Raw) which adds a little sweetness a little crunch. These are great.",
