Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes, then open foil and bake an additional 10 minutes to help carmelize the sauce on the meat.  You may have to adjust cooking time depending on the size of the ribs, and you can turn them during the last 10 minutes if you want.

Well, let me tell you.  I will never make them that way again!  I am so glad I tried this because the ribs had so much more bbq flavor and they were so tender and moist.  They came out dry sometimes when I did them my old way.  I only made about 1 lb. since it's just me and my hubby, and they were awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!!  It's definitely a keeper!",

The next day we just fired up the grill and cooked them about 20 minutes using the thicken sauce to baste. They were very tasty and tender. Our guest asked for the recipe.",
