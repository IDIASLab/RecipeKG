He asked me to make a pizza-like dish without having to make actually make a pizza or the ones that have the noodles in it. I used italian sausage instead of beef, added a chopped green bell pepper, and instead of using 2 pkg biscuit dough, I had a can of \"Pillsbury Grands\" = which are large and thick. I split the refridgerated biscuits horizontally in half and layered them, following the remaining instructions. Its a little salty for my taste (not sure why????) but good and my boyfriend really seemed to enjoy this alot. Although I'm still trying to figure out where the saltiness came from (the sausage perhaps?) overall, it was pretty good and I might make this again when my boyfriend has a craving for his \"pizza dish.\" Thanks Ginny.",

This is something I can prepare the night before and hubby puts in the oven right before I get home from work. My daughter has to have at least 2 helpings (unusual!!). I have slight variations: I use plain 'ole tomato sauce (2 8oz cans) instead of pizza sauce and put italian spices in the meat or the sauce. I also don't use the sausage we use regular pepperoni. I also cut up onion and green pepper into tiny pieces and cook with the hamburger as well as using the food processor to chop up a can of mushrooms and putting them in the sauce. Absolutely no one noticed and they still gobbled it down. i used cheap biscuits they worked great. And I made it with the biscuits cut up and not cut up I prefer cut up it's easier for the kids. All in all a wonderful recipe! Definitly on my list every week!! thanks!",

Also for those who thought the crust tasted like too much like biscuits use the old fashioned (non-flaky) biscuits rather than the buttermilk ones. TY and will keep this in my file!!!",
