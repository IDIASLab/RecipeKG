This recipe comes from the mom of one of my best friends, and I've loved it for years. It's a traditional Asian dessert, and like most, it is like a sweet soup. It can be served hot or cold. I have it hot the first night and refrigerate the rest for seconds the next day! When served cold, it will seem a little thicker.",

I used sweet potato instead of taro(it's interchangeable but sweet potato has some natural sweetness). My advice is cook the tapioca by itself as the recipe says you don't want the starchy water. In a different pot cook the taro and sugar. Add sugar till it suits your taste(it's not suppose to be too sweet) then add the tapioca and coconut milk.",

I serve this to my six month old baby and she loveees it so much.  Coconut milk is high in saturated fat which is very good for you as oppose to the poly saturated fat.  So don't be afraid of this recipe because of the coco milk. I also sub. rock sugar for palm sugar.",

                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe but had to make a major modification. Like the other 1 star reviews said it is way too much water with the taro when you add in the coconut milk. I drained much of the water out of the taro. I saved about 1 cups worth of taro-water and then poured in the coconut milk. You need to dilute the coconut milk with something and other recipes dilute it with milk. The taro-water is a good substitute and will help thicken the soup once it cools. I wouldn't put more than a cup. Since there is so much moisture in the taro you could drain out all the water. There will be some residual water in the pot (maybe 1/4-1/2 cup) that you could use to dilute the coconut milk. If its too thick once you're done you can add back in some water or m ilk. The key is to cut the taro into larger pieces (maybe 1-inch pieces) not overboil the taro. Stick to 10 minutes before adding in the coconut milk since you will need to continue to boil it to incorporate the coconut milk. Once you make these changes it comes out very nicely. I didn't put in the small tapioca pearls but I would make sure to cook the pearls then cool them with lots of cold water. Add in the tapioca pearls once the soup cools so it doesn't further cook the pearls.",
