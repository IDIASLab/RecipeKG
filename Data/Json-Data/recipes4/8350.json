Mine yield up a lot of water so next time I will try roasting the squash in a 450 degree oven for 40 to 50 minuets. Place squash in the roasting pan cut side up. The higher temp should result in a dryer more roasted squash that should cut down on the extra water that many reviewers reported. For longer strands try cutting the squash width wise in half. This really makes a big difference. Smaller squash will take less time. This will give you a more roasted and dryer squash that will not water down the recipe. Layout stands back on the parchment paper sheet,  turn off the oven and place back in the oven to further dry out.",
