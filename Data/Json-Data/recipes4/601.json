I like them crispy and I wanted to make sure the seasonings would stick so I tossed the bites into a bowl added some olive oil and tossed until they were coated. Then I did the same thing with the seasonings (what can I say--I'm lazy and messy and I hate sprinkling things). It worked perfectly. 5 minutes wasn't crispy enough for me so I did another 5 for a total of 10 minutes. 10 minutes was almost too long for the smaller and thinner pieces I managed--they were very brown but very nice and crispy. I used cheese bagels that were about ready to give up the ghost and they were perfect. Thanks for the recipe!",
