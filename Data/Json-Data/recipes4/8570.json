Second after letting the zucchini set and sweat I roasted it in a single layer on parchment paper makes the prep time longer but eliminates some of the liquid. I didn't have enough broccoli so I added cauliflower that I also roasted before adding to the bake. I had left over chicken so I added that as well. I left the tomato out until the very last minute they were in the oven only long enough to take the chill off them. Oh and I added parm Cheese into the veggies. The end result was a nice casserole. Still a little soupy but not as much as the first time I made this. Next time I think I will bake without covering at all and add the cheese about half way through the bake time.",

Added sage in addition to oregano Covered with foil baked for 20 mins at 400 but I think that's too high. Veggies were already done. Added cheese and tomato and baked at lower temp for 10 mins. I didn't have a problem at all with too much liquid. Tasted pretty good! Will not cook so long at such a high temp next time and might even add some cauliflower and carrots",
