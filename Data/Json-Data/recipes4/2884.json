Some recipes are good for whenever you are in the mood for them. But this one in my opinion is for those romantic nights. I halfed the recipe and used two Salmon portions and there was plenty of sauce. I noticed nothing was mentioned about sides by the recipe or by members who left reviews. I decide to do a side of medium white rice and some baby carrots cooked with butter salt and pepper. The sauce was great with the rice. This is also a good recipe to share wine with. All in all I loved this recipe. Oh and some people had problems finding the porcini mushrooms. I did also I think they may be seasonal. But I did find them at the grocery store in the produce section package in a dried form. All you have to do is soak them in boiling water for a few minutes and they are good to go. hope that helps.",

Apart from upping the amount of curry powder (I used some pretty spicy Madras Curry powder) and adding some dried curry leaves I made this pretty much as written. Turned out very rich and flavorful. It would work great with chicken and/or shrimp I think. Thanks!",
