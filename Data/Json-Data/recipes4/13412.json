Instead of plain water, I soaked two Celestial Seasonings honey vanilla white tea chai bags in the half cup of water I heated for about five minutes and used that to add a little oomph. I also added two tbsp. of honey. Those were the two things I noticed that people said that these muffins needed, a little spice and perhaps a little honey. The smell of these while baking was amazing and they look super fluffy and just beautiful. Mine did need just a few more minutes to bake. Half of this recipe will be for my two kids and husband and the other half will be gifted to a friend tonight. I'll update my review once I found out how everyone liked them. EDITED: They were a hit. The kids inhaled them and couldn't really tell they were sans sugar. This will be my new blueberry muffin recipe. Thank you SO much for sharing.",

I used apple sauce instead of the oil, subbed 1/4 cup of the flour for flaxseed meal, and added half a teaspoon of vanilla. I also halfed the recipe, so the measurements are based on that.",

I even added extra blueberries cinnamon and nutmeg and still nothing. Next time I will try with a little honey.

I did use a bit less soda and baking powder. I also added about a teaspoon of my homemade pumpkin pie spice. Without this added spice it's probably boring. The batter was really thick so next time I think I'll give it just a small amount of liquid sweetener. I only got 12 regular size muffins & needed 2 more minutes in the oven. Next time I'll add some walnuts for even more nutrition. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",

Increase blueberries to 1 1/2 cups and always use fresh. Replace 1/2 cup flour with flax meal and half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce (keep some of the oil because fat helps control blood sugar spikes in reaction to the sugars in food). Adding spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, mace, allspice, ginger and clove are a really good idea to give it more flavor. You can also oompf up the health factor by including fiber and vanilla protein powder.",
