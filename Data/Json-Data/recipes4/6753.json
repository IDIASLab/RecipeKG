I wouldn't change a single thing, this recipe is perfect. My only recommendation to first time testers it to not overcook the peas once the wine is added, which I accidently did on my second batch. The slight flavor of the wine is simply delectable with the peas but the wine taste will dissipate the longer it is cooked so try not to surpass the recommended cooking time. Thank you so much for sharing this beautiful recipe!",
