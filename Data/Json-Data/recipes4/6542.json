I found using the Bisquick a bit heavy, but I suppose that's the point!  I added rosemary to the Bisquick mixture.  I added thyme, garlic powder, and some Veloutine to the soup.  I didn't particularly want to add the thickener, but my mom wanted it much more like a stew than a soup.  I also added frozen peas just before dropping the dumplings.  I used 4 whole chicken breasts, as there are four of us.  There is a little bit leftover, but I found that a cereal bowl with the \"soup\" and 2 dumplings was quite enough for me.  All in all, very easy to make, tasty, and easy to adjust to individual tastes.",

I was a little iffy about \"1 whole onion\" but it blended well and wasn't at all too much! I did golf-ball sized dumplings, but they were HUGE. Don't mix around the soup once the dumplings are in; they'll fall apart. Put it on low heat too whenever you add the dumplings, otherwise you'll burn the bottom.(I did just a little).
