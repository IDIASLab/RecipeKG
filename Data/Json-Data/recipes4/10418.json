I made it exactly as written except for the cooking time. I used two small (3 oz.) cans of chunk light tuna in water and one medium-large yellow onion. After 5 minutes of cooking the onion was hardly cooked so I probably cooked it for another 5-10 minutes. The onions \"cooked down\" a little bit but I still thought there was too much onion; a small onion would have been better. I served this on a bed of no-yolk egg noodles which helped round it out; otherwise I wouldn't have known quite what to do with this. This was just weird and I don't think I'll be making this again.",

What you need to do is saute the onion in some butter until browned and soft. Then add in the tuna. Doing this really improves the flavours and makes for a very good dish. (good for on top of noodles or rice or even as a sandwich filling as strange as that sounds...) I recommend a little extra blob of butter right before serving if you are going to put it on pasta.:-) And a little S&P helps too. The recipe as written now though is really not that great but like I said with these changes it turns out delicious.",
