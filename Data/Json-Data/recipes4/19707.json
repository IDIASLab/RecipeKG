                "reviewBody": "This is INCREDIBLE!!!! The sauce is fabulous. I didn't have black soy sauce or palm sugar and when I searched for substitutes for those ingredients simply adding molasses to both regular soy sauce and brown sugar were listed and it worked well. I also didn't have fresh red Chile peppers so I subbed jalape\u00f1os. The recipe didn't mention if the marinade should be added along with the tofu and I went ahead and threw it in with the rest of the ingredients in the pan. This dish would lend itself well to any protein in place of tofu and pretty much any stir fried veggie would work as well. I think next time I'll try adding chicken and broccoli! The only thing that I would change about using tofu is that next time I would cube it instead of slicing it. Other than that I'd leave this recipe alone! EDIT: I've made this twice now the second time I doubled the sauce and allowed chicken to marinate in it all day. I added steamed broccoli before serving. Delicious!",
