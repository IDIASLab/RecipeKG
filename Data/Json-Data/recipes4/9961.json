I will give it three stars but had the recipe been as I altered it, I would have given it five stars. I sauteed finely chopped mushrooms, red peppers, green and yellow onions and garlic. I also added spinach to the mixture. I loved the cream cheese part although I was worried it would be weird. It was really great. I topped it with mozzerella, parmasan and oregano for some color. After all that, it was the best chicken lasagna ever! :o) This is a good starting recipe to 'tweak' to your own liking.",

It is a nice change from regular lasagna.  The only thing I did differently was added some garlic powder, pepper and Italian seasoning to the cream cheese mixture, and also used oven ready pasta to cut down on cooking time.  If you do try the oven ready pasta be sure to cover it with foil for the majority of cooking time, then for the last 10 minutes or so uncover to let the cheese get golden brown.",

I poached frozen chicken breasts with chopped vidalia onion, celery tops, bay leaves, seasoned salt, and cracked black pepper for about two hours on a low simmer. I then shredded the cooked, cooled chicken, and in another pan sauteed one more chopped vidalia onion with two chopped, sweet, red bell peppers, two red chili peppers, oregano, and two cloves of garlic minced in a little olive oil. I added this mixture to the chicken, tossed in enough of the spaghetti sauce to lightly moisten the mixture, then proceeded with the rest of the recipe. Everyone loved this, and I had to send leftovers home with my daughter and son-in-law (I made mine in a 13 x 9 pan with nine lasagna noodles.) This recipe is OUTSTANDING! Thank you for sharing it.",

I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and a mix of regular and non-fat mozzarella to lighten it up a bit.  I baked it in a 7\u201dx10\u201d deep dish baker, and it turned out perfectly.
