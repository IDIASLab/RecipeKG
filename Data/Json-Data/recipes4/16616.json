I formed the patties differently to see which came out better. I made a couple a bit chubby and the other various thicknesses; the chubbier ones - although they took longer to fry - actually had a better result in both taste texture and manageability. The celery gives it a nice crunch and they are indeed chewy like the description states. I was weary of the molasses and mustard frankly but Cheerios' inventions have never let me down and he is right-it is different but good. The ginger molasses and mustard gave this a tangy but delicate flavour. They weren't sweet at all. A lovely wholesome flair. I sprinkled some fresh chopped parsley and balsamic vinegar on top to garnish. Simply delicious. Thanks for this recipe. UPDATE: These freeze well. I froze half of the mixture before frying them and they cooked well once thawed. Just wait until they thaw and then form the patties and cook as written.",
