I chopped the onion in a very fine dice, fried it with 4 cloves of garlic until it was slightly soft, then added the raw sweet potato to it, fried until the sweet potato started getting soft, then added the broccoli (I used fresh), but the lid on it, until the broccoli was done. I used roasted, unsalted almonds, which I chopped... sprinkled them on top of the finished dish along with some dried cranberries.  Ginger and cinnamon would be a nice addition, but it's very good as-is. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

Each bite has a surprise of flavors and I chopped up the almonds so they weren't whole and it gives it a nice crunch.
