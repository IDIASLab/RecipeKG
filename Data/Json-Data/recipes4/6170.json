Only thing that is a challenge is getting it rolled up, depending on the shape of it this can be difficult, but don't sweat it, just make it work whatever way you have to, it will still cook just fine. Make sure you wrap it well with foil, it is a large chunk of meat and you are going to need more than one sheet. I ended up using 4, 1 under it and 3 wrapped around it.  Enjoy.
