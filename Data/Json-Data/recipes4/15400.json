Left out the cinnamon (just now realized that). Had to sub a garden fresh bell pepper for the celery. I also didn't add the water, my slow cooker seems to make a lot of water on its own. I only had diced tomatoes so I subbed the Black Beans for a can of chili beans (gave me the chili seasonings that the chili tomatoes would have). We love flavor, so my pinches were probably more like spoonfuls (except no salt, we have to eat low sodium). I also forgot the corn. Delish!! I can't wait for the leftovers. Today I'm going to eat it more like a dip on garden veggie crackers.",

I didn't have canned tomatoes with green chilies and so I chopped up a poblano and chili pepper from my garden and added in with regular diced tomatoes. I only used one pound of ground meat, no pork. I dashed the cinnamon and to me it is the spice that makes this chili different from your many run of the mill chili dishes, gives that earthy fall flavoring. I have an old crock pot that doesn't cook too hot and five hours on high was perfect. I did pre-brown my ground meat with some onions until it just turned pink, drained and added it in the beginning with all the other ingredients. I also did the open and stir once in awhile as the directions indicated, something I usually never do with crock pots, but it was needed to move around the sweet potato chunks since they seemed to like to float to the top. Everything that said a pinch, got a dash or two. Nice thickness to this and not too spicy. We topped with green scallions, cheddar cheese and sour cream. Smells so wonderful while cooking.",

The only thing I changed because I didn't have any was that I used a few shakes of Franks Hot Sauce instead of the cayenne pepper. I cut up everything and put it in a gallon ziploc bag the night before. The next morning we just dumped it into the crock pot turned it on low and let it cook all day long. Do NOT add any water - the steam from the crock pot makes plenty of liquid. Everyone is on their second bowl tonight with a request to never make regular chili again! Ha! I would have never thought that sweet potatoes would be good in a chili but they are really tasty! One thing I would suggest - after dicing your sweet potatoes you might want to nuke them a little bit first. Ours were not 100% soft even after cooking all day long. But that could be a variance in taters too. Thank you for sharing your great recipe - it will become a standard at our house now too!?",

I have made it an unofficial rule (very strong advice, lol) that this be eaten with fat free Greek yogurt mixed in! It gives it a hearty creaminess that is guilt-free! Yum!!! This chili is so friggin' awesome! It's mostly like a \"normal\" chili, but the sweet potatoes and touch of cinnamon give it a little nudge into something magically perfect for Autumn. I didn't bother with stewed, chili-seasoned tomatoes, I just used regular old canned diced tomatoes and increased the seasonings (except cinnamon) a little. No problem. Used chicken broth instead of water. Also only cooked on high 3 hours before adding the meat. First time I made it, I used all beef. I have my second batch cooking now, using 3/4 turkey, 1/4 beef (what I have on-hand) and I quadrupled the recipe using 2 crock pots, because I am entering this recipe in a chili cook-off my friend is hosting on Sunday. I will come back with an update soon! I served this with fat free Greek yogurt (sour cream is a thing of the past- I can use ALL the Greek yogurt I want, with NO guilt! It tastes the same, try it!!) chopped scallions, oyster crackers, and shredded cheddar cheese. My husband and I thought we'd died and gone to heaven. We looked forward to eating the leftovers every day, 2 meals a day, for 3 days. I can't say enough good things about this. Try it!!!",
