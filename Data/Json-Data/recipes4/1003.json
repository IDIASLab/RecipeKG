I just sprinkled in what looked like enough, about 1-1/2 tsp.  This mixture includes cumin and many other spices which are perfect for this recipe.  I also cooked my onion in the oil BEFORE adding the rice to get it nice and soft.  Other than that, I followed exactly as written and it was perfect!  ",

Don't let the other reviews prevent you from trying this simple and delicious dish. It made a great side dish for the quisadillas I made. This is also a good guy-proof recipe, considering I didn't mess it up. I'm definitely making this one again. I have a rice cooker, but I decided to take a chance and make it in a medium sauce pan, and I was glad. My rice cooker tends to singe the outer layer of rice. Cook hard!",

If, however, you're looking for a pleasantly and subtley flavored Mexican-style rice to accompany a spicier main dish, this fits the bill perfectly. I chose to saute the rice in butter rather than oil, but otherwise followed the recipe as directed.  Don't worry about \"puffing\" the rice-just saute it till golden brown, then add the chopped onion and spices, saute another minute or two, then add liquids. Cover and simmer till liquid is almost absorbed and rice is tender. Nice, basic rice recipe.",

This recipe is very close to what I learned to make from my mother.  Slight differences are that we add a little less onion about 1/8 of a cup and we add about the same amount of chopped bell pepper that is added with the onions about half way through the sauteeing of the rice.  Instead of garlic salt we use granulated garlic or fresh garlic which will add a little more flavor.  We also add a dash of black pepper.  If you don't have fresh chicken broth that is already salted, we use 2 cups water and about 1 1/2  Tblsp powdered chicken boullion by Knorr Suiza found on the Hispanic aisle which has lots of salt in it, no need for extra salt. I'm not sure about adding taco seasoning as other reviewers have suggested, this makes me think of Fast Food Bell rice.  Homemade Mexican rice is not supposed to be over flavored, the main dish should have the flavor and or the salsa that you serve should be as spicy as you desire.  These flavors should not be expected to be in the rice.  I'd say this is a darn good recipe for anyone wanting to make homemade Mexican rice!  My chef hat off to Mommyto2!",
