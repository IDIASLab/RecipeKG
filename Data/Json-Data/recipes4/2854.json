I already had all of the ingedients in bulk (and thanks to Costco, it's actually fairly inexpensive for ingredients like Pesto and Feta cheese). I don't have an outdoor grill, but I baked them at about 400 for 10 minutes and then broiled them until they were browned (about 8 minutes). I toasted the buns and topped it with a sauce that I make which is equal parts mayo and dijon mustard mixed with about a teaspoon of fresh garlic and a dash of crushed red pepper. These are the best burgers I've ever had. Thank you SO much for this recipe! ",

I replace a little more than half the bread crumbs with Italian bread crumbs. I use a little less feta. I don't add the extra salt while cooking. And the two things I force on anyone eating this are: 1) Must use english muffins for bread 2) Must top with chopped dried cranberries. This is easily my favorite turkey burger, and some of my friends prefer this recipe to beef.",

I buy turkey in 1 lb packages, so that's how much I used.  Also, I was out of gas for my grill so I had to cook them on the stove top. I didn't have any problems cooking them. However, the end result was a little disappointing. I thought there was too much pesto. I will only use 1 tbsp next time. I really like this flavor, but it was overwhelming. My husband thought they were too salty, so I will also cut back on the seasoned salt next time as well. I didn't add the additional on top, so I will probably only use t tsp total. I also wanted more cheese, so next time I will probably add 3/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup. With those modifications I think they will be a lot better!",

I mixed 1 T of pesto, a few shakes of garlic powder and about 3 T of diced red onion to the turkey.  It made four burgers that I broiled about six minutes on each side.  I ate this turkey burger on a whole wheat bun with just a tiny bit of mayonnaise, mustard and ketchup in addition to a large leaf of Romaine lettuce, a slice of red onion and a few small banana peppers.  Next time I'll be sure to have some slices of cheddar cheese on hand to melt on top.  I served the burgers with a baked bean dish.  So tasty!  Thank you!",
