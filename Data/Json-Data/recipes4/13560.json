This incorporates all of those ingredients to create a magnificently creamy soup, strong with morel flavor, but not too overpowering. This isn't healthy eating, and I don't recommend trying to make it that way. Just eat less of it! Serve with crusty bread or garlic croutons.",

Rather than use water and chicken soup base I just used chicken broth.  I used fresh thyme rather than dried and didn't bother adding the flour - it wasn't necessary.  Since my market didn't have morels, I used regular ol' mushrooms and they worked out just fine.  I used twice the amount of mushrooms called for and I'm glad I did.  Given the extra amount of mushrooms,  and the fact there are not a lot of competing seasoning ingredients, this is a pure, robustly mushroom flavored soup.  Easy to put together, ready in minutes, and can be made ahead of time.  A beautiful first course for an elegant meal.",

They are avid morel hunters and brought me back a pound of them dried.  I had no idea what really to do with them and this recipe was my answer, especially since I froze some of this bisque and I can eat it later!  The flour is used in making a \"roux\" to thicken the soup some.  It's not really a necessary step, unless you want it thicker.   I agree with the poster of the recipe, please people, don't try to make this healthy, it's not meant to be.  You could, in theory, but I wouldn't.  If you love mushrooms, you will love this recipe.  Make sure you salt it to taste though, too much and you'll ruin it, too little and it's bland.  But everyone's tastes are different.  What I found perfect for saltiness, wasn't salty enough for my dinner guests.",
