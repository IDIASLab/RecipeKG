Served this with Basmati rice and glazed carrots....Very tender and tasty and great for company....I forgot to mention I did make this for 4 people so I adjusted the ingredients accordingly.",

I cut some onions and carrots into chunks and threw them into the bottom of the pan before putting the birds in. Then I threw some fresh thyme and rosemary in. All of that helps the birds to keep moist and makes it very aromatic. I cooked at a lower temperature of 350 degrees for 3/4 of the cooking...I upped the temp to 400 for the last 20 or 30 minutes to brown the birds. The first 30 minutes I put foil over them, and then took it off for the basting portion of the cooking. \n\nI paired these birds with the \"Moroccan Cous Cous\" recipe which is on this site, and included a side of green beans to make a delicious and beautiful meal!",

I made 3 hens and if you double the recipe you should still have plenty of marinade. I didn't have orange concentrate but I do have oranges trees. I squeezed oranges till I had the same amount of juice to equal the concentrate I substituted. I used honey that has oranges cloves in it. After combining all the ingredients I found the sauce a bit thin. I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to a little bit of milk and thickened the sauce perfectly. No change of taste at all. I used the rotisserie to cook the hens rather than bake in the oven. The comments I got were\"you made an outstanding meal\". And this was the best games hens I ever had.",
