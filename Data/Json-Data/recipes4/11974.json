After all it is a quick easy meal for Japanese parents and kids love the mix of rice eggs and ketchup. Unfortunatly I lost the recipe when I returned to the US of A so I was quite excited to find this recipe. I followed this recipe exactly as it is given and was pleased to taste the same Japanese dish I had remembered. It really is a pleasant mix of tastes incredibly simple and perfectly portioned. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",

Omuraisu supposedly stands for omulet rice. I don't usually use specific measurements but this recipe couldn't hurt. I've always cooked the rice with oil but it should be good with butter.",
