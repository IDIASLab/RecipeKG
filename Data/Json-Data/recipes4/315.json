I boiled 2 sweet potatoes and 1 carrot then mashed them together with 1/4 milk, 2 tbsp of honey and 1 tbsp of margarine. It was delicious! I will definitely make it again. On a side note I've also made this with a crisp. To do that put the finished mash into a casserole dish. In a separate bowl combine 1 tbsp melted butter, 1/2 crushed bran flakes and 1/4 cup pecans and 2 tbsp of brown sugar. Mix well and sprinkle on top of squash mash. Broil it in oven until crisp is lightly browned. Serve. Delicious!",
