The first time I made it I thought it was pretty awesome but it had too much of a floury taste for my liking. Thankfully I have a coworker who is like a human version of Ratatouille and immediately made suggestions that made this soup super brilliant! So here is what I do: \n\n1) stir zucchini, onion, water, salt, basil, 1/2 tsp of black pepper and 3 tsp of chicken bouillon together in a pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until zucchini is tender\n2)puree mixture\n3)pour mixture back into pot, add 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and bring to a boil. \nthats it. super simple and it was a big hit at our potluck :D I hope someone finds this modified version helpful. cheers!",

I doubled everything, and instead of mixing the flour and milk, I sauteed the onions in butter, added the flour to make a roux, then added the milk and a pinch of nutmeg to that and heated until the milk was thickened.  Then I added the milk/onion mixture to the zucchini and brought back to a boil.  It thickened nicely, but isn't too thick and doesn't have a floury taste.  I also hit the zucchini with my stick blender after it was soft rather than putting it into the blender  Great way to use up some of my many zucchinis!!  Thanks for the recipe!",

But I would add more zucchini as it cooks down quite a bit and I even used more than the 4cups. And definitely go less on the flour. 3tbsp almost ruins it. 2 med/small zucchini made about 6cups so I will try with at least 8cups next time and no more than 2tbsp flour max. Flavor is delicate so don't overspice. Flavor will develop after sitting a bit. I ended up adding a dash more basil along with the pepper in the end. Perfect recipe size for 1 person. You will not get sick of it before it is gone.yum.",
