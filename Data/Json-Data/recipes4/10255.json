I used chopped onions, italian seasoning, red onions, red pepper, garlic salt, and s&p. 2.) I added a can of chopped tomatoes with green bell peppers to the meat as well. 3.) After I added the soups I added 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup milk- reserving the last 1/2 cup of milk. 4.) with the last 1/2 cup of milk mix 2 lrg. eggs with 4 tbl. spoons of grated parmesan.  5.) to layer: I buttered the bottom of the casserole dish first. added the spag. 2nd, poured the egg mixture over just the noodles to form a bond- 3rd, layered graded cheddar cheese, then lastly topped with the meat mixture. I added mozzarella cheese to the very top. Anywho- the final product was thick and creamy, with extraordinary flavor. I was hesitant of the cream of mushroom soup- but it should stay for sure. Be brave and try a new flavor to a traditional dish! I served ours with home made garlic bread as well, we will be having this much more often- my husband and 2 yr. old daughter loved it.",

I've made it a few different ways and this is how we like it. 4 servings: 7 oz spaghetti. 1/2 onion chopped; 1 green pepper chopped; 2 cloves garlic chopped; 1 pack fresh mushrooms chopped - saut\u00e9 in olive or vegetable oil - season with salt pepper and Italian seasoning. 1 lb. (on the shy side) lean ground beef - browned seasoned with salt and pepper. Add 1 small jar of traditional spaghetti sauce 1 can cream of celery and 1 can cream of mushroom soup. Simmer for about 5 minutes. Add a handful of mozzarella and a few sprinkles of Parmesan cheese; re-season if necessary. Mix the sauce with the spaghetti and pour into a medium size lasagna dish. Lightly top with mozzarella and Parmesan and bake for 35 minutes at 350 degrees. Let sit for at least 5 minutes. This is a nice creamy change from traditional spaghetti...and it's not bland if you season the vegetables and the meat. You can also make this in advance and bake it later and it re-heats nicely...that's 5 stars in my book!",
