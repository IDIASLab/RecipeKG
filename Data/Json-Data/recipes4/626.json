First, be sure to use baking potatoes, as the recipe states.  These have thicker, less delicate skin than some other varieties.  Second, don't attempt to scoop out all the flesh, down to the skin.  Leave a good 1/4 in. of potato on the skin.  This is the way restaurants do it and generally makes for much better results.",

I also added 4 oz. of cream cheese to this recipe and used packaged Hormel REAL Crumbled Bacon to save time.  I made and stuffed these potatoes in the morning and refrigerated them, then cooked then at 350 for about 35-40 mins.  Sooooo I guess these can be done ahead of time which makes them even better!!  Certainly not a low-fat recipe - especially after I added the cream cheese, but wonderful.  My family and friends loved it. I love the idea that they can be done ahead of time. Hope someone finds this helpful. *******************************\r\nUpdate:  So here it is 2013! I can\u2019t believe I wrote the above post in 2004.   I\u2019m still making this recipe! I got the \u201cdo-ahead\u201d instructions down and thought I should update this post.  \r\nYou can make this dish a day or two ahead of time.  Do not bake it.  After topping with bacon and cheese, just cover with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator.  Remember the directions do not consider the refrigerator factor so it will increase baking  time.  However, to help take it of the refrigerator and let it sit out at room temperature for about one hour or a little longer. This will cut down on baking time. Bake about 1.25 hours but watch them \u2013 you want them heated through and the cheese lightly browned.  \r\nFreezing:   Freeze prior to baking.  Tip:  flash freeze them so they\u2019re in individual servings.",

It doesn't matter if you cook them at 350,400 whatever. The point is to cook them until a knife will go easily through them. It usually takes me an hour and a half. I also wrap mine in foil with a teeny bit of butter and salted. \r\n2) I also mash mine with about 1/2 pkg of cream cheese. I just happen to really like cream cheese. :-)\r\n3) I mix the bacon in the potato mixture. I don't mess with topping it usually. \r\n4) The easiest way to get the mixture into the shells is to spoon it all into a large Ziploc bag, snip a corner off the bag, and squeeze it into the shells. No mess! \r\n5) If you're in a hurry, you can also broil the potatoes until the tops start to brown. Quicker than baking.\r\n6) These freeze really well wrapped in plastic wrap and then aluminum foil.",

                "reviewBody": "I have been making this same recipe for years with one exception.  I make them with mini red skinned potatoes.  Here's how: cut the mini potatoes in half length-wise, toss in a bowl with a few tablespoons of olive oil to coat and bake them at 425 degrees, cut side down for about 25 minutes.  After they have cooled for about 10 minutes you can scoop out the flesh with a mellon baller.  Then follow the rest of the steps of this recipe.  Using the mini potatoes is faster than larger ones (use as many mini potatoes as you think it would take to equal four large potatoes, usually about 12 for the size I buy)because they bake so fast and they make perfect sized finger foods.  Great for a barbeque when none of the other food requires a fork!  No matter how many of these I make I never have leftovers!",

Tips: Next time, I'd reduce green onions in the stuffing mix and would add a little finely chopped bacon.\nHow to get perfect potato \"shells\" - bake potatoes in oven (if you wrap in foil when you bake, don't do so), allow to cool about 10 minutes, and slice in half longwise as recipe suggests. Then, use knife to gentle slice around the edge of the potato as you would when cutting a grapefruit (leave about 1/8 inch of flesh and skin to give the shell some weight). Then, slice the flesh of the potato almost to the bottom in quarters. Use the knife from the center to loosen the quarters from the shell. This should leave you with a firm shell to stuff.",

Even the pickiest of eaters loved these twice baked potatoes, sour cream and all! I received compliments for three days afterwards.  So simple and fun to make... I made them the day before and threw them in the oven for 35 minutes straight from the fridge (topped with extra cheese of course) and they were perfect!  After initially baking the potatoes I took other's advice and put them in the freezer to cool-and scooping was so easy. Would definitely recommend adding the sour cream a little bit at a time to get the desired texture that you want. I can't wait for another cookout so I can make these wonderful potatoes again!",
