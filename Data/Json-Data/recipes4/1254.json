Possibly, though, these would be done in an hour without opening the oven to baste (I am a frequent baster)... I recommend this recipe, just watch for doneness!",

I marinated for about an hour in a big ziplock bag so the color was wonderful before even cooking.  Used 4 hens. I added 30 min. to the cooking but ended up cooking 1-1/2 hours at 350\u00b0. TIP: if you bake 4 at once, rotate the whole birds half-way through cooking so both sides are exposed to the same amount of heat. Setting side-by-side the 'inside' halves were underdone, outside halves were perfect.",

By the time it was done, I felt like I could have ran to the store and bought something in place of this.  Not sure if I would do again, due to the length of time to cook.  \n\n***11/28/2008 UPDATE***\nSo I redid this for thanksgiving, ensuring that I followed the recipe and cooked it longer.  The results were AWESOME!!!!  My family could not stop raving about this and requesting this.  This time, I halved each hen, and then soaked the hens overnight in a ziploc to marinate it.  The next day I just threw it in the oven for like 1 hour 45 min.  Let me tell you, these hens were finger licking good..Awesome flavor, taste, texture..Loved it!!!  ",
