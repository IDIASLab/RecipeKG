        "description": "Springfield, Missouri is the home of Cashew Chicken. This is supposed to be Leong's original recipe. Leong and his brother Gee developed this famous dish, creating a fried chicken with an Asian flair in the 1960s. This is the closest recipe I have ever found to tasting like the original. And since it is supposed to be the original, maybe that is why? There are numerous variations of this famous dish, so it is how you remember it! Make your favorite fried rice or order from your favorite restaurant to go along with the chicken. Enjoy!",

When I would travel around the country and order cashew chicken it was NEVER cashew chicken as I knew it; it was so puzzling. Finally someone explained to me that it truly was 'Springfield' cashew chicken and that other cities' renderings of the dish were entirely different. Thanks for posting. I was given a similar recipe several years ago (by someone who knew the story as Perri does) but I lost it. Scrumptious!",

However, mine calls for sugar in the sauce, and I really believe it gives it something that this recipe is lacking. Also, my method for battering is different. I coat the pieces in flour first (let sit in the flour to soak up the moisture on the chicken) then soak in a mixture of 4 eggs to 1 1/2 cups milk, also for a few minutes. Then redip in flour and deep fry. This makes the most incredible coating on the pieces, that really holds onto the sauce. By the way, I also use that method to make to-die-for chicken strips, adding salt and pepper to the final flour.",

I used chicken base instead of the chicken bullion cubes as that is what I had on hand and I added about 1 tsp. of sugar to the sauce. Also I added some low sodium soy sauce to the sauce as well. Also here is a good tip: after dipping the chicken in the egg and then coating with flour I put the chicken on waxed paper on cookie sheets and put them in the freezer for about 1 1/2 hours prior to cooking. I have found this helps the breading stay on while cooking.",
