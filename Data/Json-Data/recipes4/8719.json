I'm going to throw those recipes out and replace them with this one.  The only change I made was that I used green onions and I sauteed them with fresh mushrooms ahead of time.  Otherwise, I made it as written and it turned out perfect.  (I love the cheese on the bottom.)  For a timesaver, you can layer all of the ingredients in the pan the night before, so that the only step you have to do in the morning is to pour the eggs over and bake.",
