I only used 1 tablespoon of red pepper and some of the family still thought it was a little hot. Personally i didnt think so. I will be making these again. Very nice flavor.

I didn't end up using butter I used only a tablespoon or so of extra virgin olive oil (it's a little heart healthier) and because my kids were eating these I cut the red pepper spice back to one teaspoon. I didn't cook my fries in a casserole dish I layered foil over a baking sheet and baked them on the foil. I also used steak fries. My husband really liked these but my kids didn't care for them much at all. I had one and thought it was tasty. I served this with my homemade fry sauce that paired well though it was quite a kick combined with the spices from the fries.",

However I felt it was necessary to write about this one. I'm a huge fan of anything hot/spicy and was excited about trying these fries. I followed the ingredient amounts exactly but used 3 tbsp of olive oil instead of the butter (at the suggestion of other reviews). I placed everything in a large ziploc bag and tossed to evenly coat the potatoes. They smelled great while baking but I was SO disappointed! The spices seemed to overwhelm each other resulting in just alot of \"hot\" but not much flavor. I'm not sure what I would change if I try them again but something just wasn't \"right\" for me. Maybe less red pepper would make the lemon pepper more distinctive. I tried dipping them in ketchup or Ranch dressing and still didn't enjoy them.",
