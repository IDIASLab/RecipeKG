The directions called for baking the pasta nests in 4-5 ramekins but I opted to bake them in two mini cast iron skillets. Those two servings could have easily feed 4. This dish was even better after it had sat at room temperature for a couple of hours. In the past I ve used a different pasta sauce but that s going to change. Barilla past sauce has more of an Italian flavor without the tangy after taste. My only suggestion would be to boil the pasta first so that it s ready once the Italian sausage is cooked and drained. My only change to the recipe was to cook the pasta longer because we like ours a little past the al dente stage.",
