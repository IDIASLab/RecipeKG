WARNING: Don't be an idiot like me - either use instant (I never have that on hand) or COOK the rice a little first. You'd think that was fairly basic but the minute I put it together I thought \"oh that's not good.\" And cooked it anyway. The rice was mostly crunchy. But the rest was yummy. I'll do it again.

Anyway tonight he brought home two ham steaks fresh green beans and an Uncle Ben's sun-dried tomato rice mix. I used these along with cream of mushroom soup and shreded jack cheese. Per another reviewer's advice I partially cooked the rice mix first and steamed the green beans. We loved it!!! Nice easy weeknight meal and a great Chopped challenge!",

We used the suggestion of using 2 cans of beans and liked it but thought that an additional can of cream of celery soup would have made the dish more moist (balancing out the amount of rice) so we'll do that next time. We will make it again! Second time around: We preferred this version over my first. Changes from originally posted recipe: 2 cans green beans (drained) 1 can cream of celery soup AND 1 can cream of chicken soup (undiluted) 3/4 cup milk 1 tbls Worcestershire. I baked it in a 9 x 13 inch glass baking dish. This seems to be a nice balance of flavors and moisture. It made two meals for the two of us. Good warm meal on a cold evening.",
