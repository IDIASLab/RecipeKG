When she tasted it her exact words \"It's just right. Not to sweet and not to spicy\". I will definitely make this again. My one suggestion would be to make sure you use the Italian Sausage I don't think it would be as good with out the extra kick from the seasonings of the sausage.",

I had a similar experience as the last person who commented...my boyfriend walked in the door and said he could smell the sauce from outside our home and that it smelled fanstastic.  I stayed completely true to the recipe except for a couple of things-which were only due to personal preference.  I used 1 lb of ground beef instead of sausage and added half of a chopped white onion while seasoning beef.  Also added 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes that gave the sauce a small zing.  We LOVED it and both agreed this recipe will be a staple in our home.  Thank you so much for submitting this :-)",

I used fresh basil and oregano but added those at the end. I did add some dried in the beginning. Also used 3 cloves fresh garlic and some dried onion. I used two larger cans of tomato sauce (14 oz?) instead of the smaller ones and one can was no-salt-added. This sauce was still a little too salty for me probably because of the evaporated liquid during the long simmer. The long simmer is essential though (I did a little over an hour) to develop that great thick texture and great flavor. Mine got a little too thick so I added a splash of water at the end. Served over whole-wheat spaghetti.",

The sauce turned out rather thick. The flavors were very good though. Because of the thickness we did have to add just regular jar sauce.
