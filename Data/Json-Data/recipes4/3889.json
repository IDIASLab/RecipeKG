I did these in large muffin tins (it made six little muffins) because it cooks faster, serves more neatly, and is easier to wrap the bacon! I also added about a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to keep it moist, and because it is such a good flavor with the beef. Next time i would use a few less bread crumbs, because the flavor of the bread crumbs was a bit overpowering. AWESOME recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "I followed the recipe as close as I could with the ingredients I had on hand. I was low on bread crumbs so I used half crushed Ritz crackers. I doubled all the spices and also added 4 cloves fresh minced garlic. To make the meatloaf wrapping a little easier, I just stuffed the inside with cheese (pre-sliced cheddar--about six slices) and then formed the rest of the loaf around it. I've baked meatloaf with cheese on top and when I go to drain the grease off, I'd lose the top cheese in with the grease which is a total bummer. It helped that I kind of piled half of the meat mixture in a really big loaf pan, layered the cheese, then piled the rest of the meat mixture on top. I just turned the pan over to dislodge the loaf, then wrapped it with bacon. This really did need the extra spices for us, but that was a personal choice. Next time, I'd like to try this with hickory BBQ sauce. My boys really liked this, especially my oldest. He's like his mom, really loves the bacon. My husband was thrilled because I used real thick sliced bacon and not turkey bacon. ;) NOTE: It might help if you form the meatloaf a couple hours before you have to bake it so it has time to hang so it really stays a \"loaf\" shape and not a meat blob on your plate. I learned that after years of meat blobs.",

The second time I chopped the raw bacon and mixed it into the raw ground beef and cut the cheese into large cubes (maybe 1/2 inch) and mixed those in. I cooked as directed sprinkled some cheese on top at the end and it was great. The bacon flavor permeated the meat rather that just sitting on top and there were little bursts of cheese throughout the loaf.",
