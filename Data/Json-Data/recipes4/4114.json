I had saved half of a rotisserie chicken from my fav grocery store which cut waaaay down on prep time. Followed recipe didn't change a thing and it is beyond delicious. The vinegar and hot pepper sauce gave it just the right kick. I saw one grand child with one in each hand and wanted to take a photo but had to wait for batteries to be re-charged and by the time I got back to the camera there were not enough wontons left on the platter to take a decent photo! Ranch dressing was the nibblers choice and I was informed that this could be a Super Bowl tradition any ole time I felt like it!!",

I also sprayed the wontons with Pam after stuffing, then sprinkled with kosher salt and baked at 375\u00b0 for 15 minutes. Served with blue cheese dressing - fantastic, everyone really loved them! Next time I try these, I will combine the cream cheese with the chicken filling before stuffing the wontons. Great recipe, perfect for watching football!",
