The only problem I had was finding a saucepan big enough to fit all the ingredients in!  I ended up only adding half of the \"water\" (I used veggie broth instead) at first and not adding the other half until the end when the peanut butter was added.  I used crunchy peanut butter rather than peanut butter + peanuts.  Cilantro on top was great!  I pureed about half of the soup and left the other half chunky.  I served it over brown rice in a bowl.  A great meal!",

This soup was the hit of the night.  It has an exotic taste (much like Indian food, as you can imagine from the spices, plus I used garam masala instead of the cinnamon and cloves), but that nice, nutty peanut butter flavour is there as well.\r\n\r\nThe only other thing I did different than the recipe was omit usage of the blender.

I used 2 medium-sized yams, rather than sweet potatoes, and I don't know how much they weighed.  I only pureed about half of the recipe and then added 1/4c of dried black currants at the end and let it cook for another 5 minutes to plump the currants.  Adding the fruit made this recipe similar to the Delicious Chickpea Curry (also on this site), but this was so much better with the peanut butter and chopped peanuts. Really good combination of flavours.",

I was not particularly fond of the \"raw peanut\" taste... maybe I should have used the unsalted dry-roasted peanuts as a garnish instead of actually putting them in the soup. I followed this recipe exactly as written and had high hopes considering the reviews I read. I love the idea of this soup... but I do not think I will be making this again. Sorry:(",
