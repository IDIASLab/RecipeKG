I made the falafel pretty small and cut them in 1/2 before putting on the salad so it would be easier to eat. I couldn't fit the feta in a row on the plate (it was too full lol) so I just sprinkled it over top the falafel. I really REALLY enjoyed this salad and so did my girls...I will def be making this again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
