I have made this cake so many times and everyone who has tried it loves it. I do a few things differently however. First I use the handle of a wooden spoon to poke the holes in the cake. It works much better than a straw. Also for a little richer taste I substitute a 17 oz. jar of Mrs. Richardson's Butterscotch Caramel Sauce for the caramel ice cream topping. It adds a deep buttery richness to the cake without making it overly sweet. Then I pour the sweetened condensed milk over the still-warm cake let it soak in and pour the butterscotch caramel sauce over it. Finally I don't like storing the cake in the refrigerator because it changes the texture but it has to be refrigerated because of the whipped topping. I store the cake at room temperature and just add a dollop of whipped topping and a sprinkle of toffee bits to each piece right before serving. The cake stays beautifully moist and tastes absolutely heavenly! I hope you enjoy yours however you make it!",
