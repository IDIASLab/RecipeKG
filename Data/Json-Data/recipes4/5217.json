I had bone in thighs and only let them marinade for 1 hours. Not sure why it seems everyone wants to throw away perfectly good marinade when all you have to do is boil it first or use it on the meat prior to cooking. I rolled the chicken in the crumb mixture and poured the herbed oil over the chicken BEFORE I baked it! The oil helped the crumbs stick to the chicken and gave it a Super crispy crust! This chicken was moist and Very flavorful! I didn't have any basil so I used a little bit of dried tarragon. My DD and her friend sat down for dinner before they went out to a party and the friend loved the chicken! Hard to impress a teenage girl seems I pulled it off:) Thank you rkbamom will make this again!",

Marinaded all day flipping the bag a few times. Used 6 breasts so increased the topping which I didn't need to do - I think the original amount would have covered 6 generously. Baked on a baking sheet covered with aluminum foil at 400 because I did not get them pounded as thin as directed and ended up baking for about 40 minutes instead of 30 for the same reason. The chicken was amazingly moist; the topping was crispy; and the household says PLEASE put it in rotation!",
