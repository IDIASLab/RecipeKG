I used habanero sauce for the hot sauce and I increased the amount of cheese to a cup! Then took the meat and divided it in half flattened it out put the topping on and covered that with the other meat portion. Made certain it was sealed all around so the cheese would not leak out. It was very good as supper and the next day we had it cold for sandwiches. If I rated it as a meatloaf I'd give it a 5 s!",
