Everyone agreed this was a keeper recipe. The rave comments continued during game time and dessert!!  The sauce was perfect....not too sweet or salty.  I saw the suggestion about adding water to the sauce but I would not do that as the sauce thins during the cooking process and the water would dilute the awesome flavor.  I served this with egg noodles.  I used the sauce in the crock pot as an au jus.  Again rave reviews.  I do recommend using a crock pot cooking bag.....clean up is a breeze!  Cooked for 6.5 hours on low.",
