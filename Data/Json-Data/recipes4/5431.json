For those of you who have never made a cheese sauce before you do need to saut\u00e9 the onions (and fresh garlic if you choose) first then mix in flour and spices then slowly add the milk then cheese.  A whisk works best to stir the sauce. Sauce is ready when the cheese is completely melted.",

Then I poured the mushroom sauce on top and worked it through the dish.  Saves a lot of unnecessary fussing.\nAlso, I put the entire dish in the microwave for 20 minutes.  It ensured that the potatoes were fully cooked without pre-cooking them.  I let it cook the full 4 hours which made it cheesy.\nThis is a keeper - winter or summer.",

(As a side note, I did not taste the completed dish as I'm vegan, but made it for my husband, who raved over it).  I fried four slices (chopped) of thick-sliced bacon, drained, and set aside.  I then fried my ham slices in the bacon drippings to caramelize them for extra flavor.  For the sauce, I added the bacon along with the other ingredients.  I omitted the peas, used 1/4 tsp. of both garlic and onion powders.  I didn't have any cheddar, so I used a 2 C. bag Mexican cheese shredded blend.  I also used a whole medium/large onion, instead of a 1/2 C.  So, in essence, all I did was add bacon, a little extra seasoning, and extra cheese.  I baked it for about 1 hour 15 min., and my husband said the potatoes were cooked perfectly- cooked, but not falling apart.  Oh, and I left the skins on the potatoes (used organic).  I did as another reviewer said and poured half the sauce over the first layer, the other half over the top of the whole thing.  I took the foil off about the last 45 minutes or so, and it browned up great.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

If you are tempted to saut\u00e9 the onion I would advise against it--the raw onion adds so much flavor while it's baking and it softens while cooking.  It's also not necessary to toss the ingredients first--they all blend together while cooking and as you serve it out.  With out a doubt this will be my new go-to.  It might be fun to add some bread crumbs to the top sometimes but really it isn't necessary at all!",
