It was a small girls night out gathering with only 4 small appetizer dishes. This was the only dish that had no leftovers. I gave out the recipe enough that I wish I had written it down and copied it. I even used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and egg beaters. I also reduced the butter and brushed it on instead of rolling it around in the butter. I had enough for 24 slices of bread and could have made more except I ran out of bread. I definitely reccomend you give this one a try.",

I used whole grain bread decreased the butter & & greatly decreased the cooking time (down to about 14 minutes but next time I will set the oven @ 375 & cook for about 18 minutes). I added chopped chives & freshly ground black pepper to the cream cheese mixture & took the suggestion to sprinkle sesame seeds onto them after rolling them in the butter...very nice addition to the recipe. I used gorgonzola cheese & neufatchel cheese & because of previous reviews spread it a little thicker (but not too much) than I would have...which was a good move. It'll be nice to have homemade appetizers ready to pop in the oven whenever wanted.",

I also forgot to add some spices to the cheese mix (as recommended by other reviews) and so sprinkled garlic powder and sea salt on top before baking. In my taste batch using variations of spices on top this was by far the best combo. I also tried both the brush method and the rolling method with the butter and the rolling method won hands down. I just used a pair of tongs to give it a quick roll in the pan of melted butter and still only used one cube of butter. I also skipped the toothpicks. I found that soft fresh bread stuck together just fine with the cheese sauce and I crimped the seam a little to help keep it there. And just FYI the ones I baked immediately without freezing were done in just 10 minutes. All in all I LOVE this recipe though it was a little more time-consuming than I anticipated.",
