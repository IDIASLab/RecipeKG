They looked more appetizing that way & more interesting to eat because of the different layers/textures. PLEASE NOTE: {Although I made this 'close to' as was written I made the following adjustments} I doubled the amount of Hatfield kielbasa & Shrimp called for in the recipe & I'm glad I did, this way the proportions of grits to meat ratio was perfect IMO.  Instead I used only 1 Tablespoon of the Red Pepper flakes & only one 'sprig' of Rosemary. Instead of adding all of the Hot pepper, rosemary & garlic solely to only just the meat/shrimp mixture as the recipe had instructed, instead  I 'divided' those three things equally between the grits & the meat mixture to flavor both of them {first slightly sauteing half the garlic before adding it to the grits.} This gave the grits so much more flavor. This recipe is a winner & keeper. *TIP: As leftovers this also made a great breakfast when served as a side with two sunny side up eggs & a glass of OJ.",
