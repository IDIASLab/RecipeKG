I sprinkle my chops with seasoning salt, onion and garlic powder prior to dipping in a milk/egg wash, then the seasoned flour with black pepper added. Then I let the chops sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes to an hour before frying to get the coating \"gummy\" looking, so the coating will not fall off while frying. After frying the chops, I keep them warm and use the same skillet to whip up milk gravy, using the rest of the seasoned flour, pepper a little chicken soup base, salt and milk. Serve with mashed potatoes, buttered corn and biscuits. YUMMY!",

I used (about 3/4 tsp) Goya Adobo seasoning instead of Seasoned Salt, added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp crushed rosemary, and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  These truly were the most scrumptious fried pork chops I have ever had.  I would suggest 8/9 min on each side for 1 inch thick chops.",

Number one, add some bread crumbs, garlic powder, salt, and maybe a little cayenne to the flour mixture.  Number two-make sure you coat the pork chops in the flour mixture, then dip in an egg/milk mixture, then back in the flour mixture (at this point I just pour the flour mixture out of the ziplock bag onto a plate).  Finally, let the pork chops rest on a plate in the fridge.  Use no bone in, thin cut pork chops by the way.  Really great recipe with some tweaks!  ",
