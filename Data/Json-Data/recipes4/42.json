The sweet potatoe just barely cooked right (not to self: don't use too large of a potato next time) I then took a pat of softened butter added some brown sugar pumpkin pie spice and mixed together. This was added to the sweet potato for those with a sweeter tooth. Delicious and I would definitely make again... don't use thin pork chops as they will turn out dry.
