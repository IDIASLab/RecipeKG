I would like a little thicker gravy. This was pretty easy to make and I will surely make it again.  I like the easy crust batter. I think I will keep that recipe on hand for other meat pies!",

I added onion salt and garlic to the water while cooking the chicken and mistakenly thought the broth would add the needed flavor to the dish. I was so wrong. This recipe lacks any seasoning beyond salt in the water that cooks the potatoes. I added chopped baby carrots and frozen peas or more color and veggie flavor but this recipe desperately needs some minced garlic and onion salt and pepper at the very least. My crust took a full hour to have any color at all. At that point it was just a light brown. The recipe has possibilities but it needs help.",
