The noodles were so easy the batter was a bit sticky but I kept adding flour until it was just right. And they cooked up beautifully didn't fall apart even on leftovers. I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. Another option is to buy a rotisserie chicken so it's already cooked then pull the meat off and add it in the last step when putting everything together. I recommend this soup - absolutely delicious. Yum!",

The only difference when I prepare it myself is to add a little more basil, some thyme and a bay leaf to the slow cooking chicken. This is the ultimate comfort food, and much heartier than your plain ol' chicken noodle soup. In my family, we serve it up nice and thick, over buttery mashed potatoes. Mmmm...I'm hungry for it just thinking about it.",

                "reviewBody": "I used dried noodles because making my own sounds like too much hard work what with 5 kiddies to cook for! But I have to agree with another review that the end result was quite bland and we had to pep it up with salt/seasoning. I will stick with my good old favourite chicken & vegetable noodle soup recipe and won't make this again. Sorry.",
