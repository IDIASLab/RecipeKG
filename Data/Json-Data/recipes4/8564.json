I didn't have time to use crockpot so I followed all the steps and then baked in oven at 350 for about 45 minutes then added spices & cheese and baked for additional 15 minutes.  I have a very picky family and we rarely ever eat leftovers.  This recipe made enough for all of us to have a leftover for lunch the next day and surprisingly EVERYONE ate it all.  Will make again!
