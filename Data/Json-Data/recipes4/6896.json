I used THICK pork chops and set the timer to check them at 30 minutes- they were already at 170!!  They would have been absolutely dead at 60 minutes, they were overdone as it was.  That being said, the sauce and cook method are awesome and we'll definitely be making this one again.",

After reading another review I just used 1 cup of beef broth which was plenty and I left the seasonings the same. I didn't take a picture of these because they didn't look so pretty; my sour cream separated a bit in the sauce. They tasted great though and I served them along side a baked potato. The sauce was nice on the potato. I used Creole Seasoning from this site for the Cajun and it gave it a nice kick. I didn't have savory so I used thyme.",
