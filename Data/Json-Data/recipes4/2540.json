I then put them on a parchment paper-lined pan and put them in the freezer for a couple hours. I think that really helped the breading to stay on. You may also omit the pepper(s) if you want it kid-friendly or you don't like spicy. Minus the peppers it tasted just like those at the Quaker Steak and Lube restaurants! I found that the dill pickle slices work much better than spears.",
