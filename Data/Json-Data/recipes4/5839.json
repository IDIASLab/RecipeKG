The only addition I made was dried minced garlic. I may try this out in my crockpot next time...but definatly making this again!!!",

I used what was left in a bottle of Shiraz (about 2/3 cup) & substituted low sodium cream of chicken soup only because I didn't have cream of mushroom. Used fresh mushrooms instead which I'd quickly saut\u00e9ed with clove of garlic. A few grinds of black pepper & 3-1/2 hours later the roast was moist & tender & the gravy was the perfect consistency & full of flavor. Also I added some carrots & celery for the last 1-1/2 hours (turning up the oven to 325 ) & served with ricotta mashed potatoes. We're actually looking forward to the leftovers tonight!",
