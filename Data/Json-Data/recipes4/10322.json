I made it with 2c water, flour, 4 TBS corn starch, and the fried drippings from step one.  This did the trick.  The chicken was very moist!  Very easy to make.\r\n\r\nThanks for the good recipe!

I used \"Chicken Seasoning\" from Heather's Fried Chicken on this site in the flour to coat the chicken and then more in the gravy. (chicken seasoning mix: Stir together 2 tablespoons black pepper 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon paprika and 1 tablespoons kosher salt.) I heated homemade chicken stock in the dutch oven - added the milk and simmered it before adding the seared chicken. For the chicken I just halved the chicken and cooked one half it was not submerged in the gravy just simmered in it. The gravy did need some more seasoning. I am glad I made this - it has been waiting for a picture for a long time. Not sure if I would make it again though.",
