After reading the other reviewers comments, I used sharp cheddar, 2 cans of green beans, and 4 oz sour cream. Other than that, I made it according to the recipe. This came out of the oven with a nice taste - and raves from my picky family. Thanks for sharing... For next time, I would probably cook the onion, celery, and green bell pepper, prior to mixing the rest of the casserole together.",
