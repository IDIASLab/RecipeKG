For an authentic Tiramisu you ALWAYS use Marscapone cheese and NEVER cream cheese! 2.) A Tiramisu should be LIGHTLY sweet but not overpowering so add about 5 sachets of vanilla sugar in place of the vanilla extract. (If you don't know what that is add 3-4 Tablespoons of sugar to taste along with the vanilla extract. 3.) It's better made the day before so the flavors have time to meld. If you don't have time at least give it 8 hours. Note: I make it this way and everyone tells me it's better than a restaurant's and there's NO raw eggs to worry about. Try it with the changes and you WON'T be disappointed! (:",

It was ok... didn't really taste like tiramis\u00f9 but it tasted good. A little too much vanilla in my opinion. But today i took it out to have a small bite after lunch.... 100 times better than last night!!!! It really helped to let the tiramis\u00f9 sit over night in the refrigerator. It was excellent!!!! I still wouldn't say restaurant quality but it tasted good.",

I did not use amaretto also doubled the mascarpone halved the coffee added vanilla sugar as suggested by someone. The coffee part was so runny that I thought the cake would be liquid and impossible to serve. Anyway I put it in the fridge over night and in the morning it turned out to be the best tiramisu ever:). So it's really important to keep it in the fridge for a night to get the ladyfingers soaked and the cream in shape:). I love that it has no eggs and is much lower in calories. I will make it again!",

I didn't use the amaretto and that didn't hurt the recipe. Next time I will drizzle some coffee on the ladyfingers as well to soak them up a bit more. Also I felt like the cheese/cream mixture amount was too low for the amount of lady fingers (i know i didn't use amaretto but still). I will double this too next time or use less ladyfingers. I think I will keep this as my staple tiramisu recipe considering NO eggs! Cuts my prep time tremendously and tastes just as good. Thanks Nette and Leslie;)",

(marscapone and sugar) and made a few other adjustments. 1- I increased the amount of marscapone to 16oz. total. I think it needs a thicker layer of both creams but I did not adjust the amt of liquid I mixed it with and it came out nice and firm and held a nice shape on the plate. I was surprised how loose the Coffee/Liquor/Cheese mix was but it chilled nicely. 2-I used Kahlua instead of Amaretto Also since Ladyfingers come in different textures (the traditional crispy biscuit or a spongecake version) I was unsure how it would turn out as this recipe didn't specify. I selected the Crispy Ladyfingers and let them soak in the coffee/liquor for about 5 mins. Turned out just right! A new family favorite!",
