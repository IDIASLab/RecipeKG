I don't know if there's a typo in the recipe or if my egg molds are larger or what but I used 3oz. boxes of gelatin (so I could do a few different colors) and I only got 3 eggs filled which would mean that a 6oz. box would only fill 6 egg molds and not the 12 specified. It was no big deal but I just wanted to let others know to mabe plan to use more gelatin if they want the specified amount. Other than that me and the little guy LOVED making these and can't wait to try other flavors. Oh and the whipped topping mixed w/ the pudding mix was a great idea. It gave it a lot more flavor than just using the whipped topping alone. These are a great creative idea and a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing.:)",
