We made them just like the recipe outlined, except I didn't have any hot pepper sauce and so used Sriacha, and wound up cooking them for four hours instead of two. We made these with fresh mustard greens as part of a paleo diet - the recipe is perfect for that - and I wish I had the ability to can them.",
