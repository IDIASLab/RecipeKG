Definitely worth the extra effort and time it took to caramelize the onions.  Just enough horseradish and Dijon to make these interestingly different, although I wouldn't hesitate to add more horseradish.  I found I didn't need the extra butter at the end - the butter used to caramelize the onions was enough.  It was nice to find a different and delicious spin on mashed potatoes.",

It didn't take too long to make and didn't have any unusual ingredients, that is nice when you have a family and house to keep up while preparing meals.  It made a huge heap and we served it with pork tenderloin and steamed broccoli - it was perfect.  I'd recommend it - a nice twist on mashed potatoes...",

The only change I made was to substitute the white wine vinegar to half white cooking wine half cider vinegar because I didn't have white wine vinegar on hand. For the small amt. required I doubt it would have made much difference. But the flavor! I had 3 helpings my boyfriend loved it as well. I know I'll be making this again & again. Thanks for the recipe! ADD-ON So I made this again and it was even better this time. I boiled the potatoes with minced garlic used skim milk instead of half & half and this time I sauteed chopped cabbage (about 2-3 cups) in bacon grease 'til tender and added along with the onions. It was very simaler to Irish colcannon and tasted great with the corned beef I prepared. Everyone who loves horseradish and potatoes should try this dish!",
