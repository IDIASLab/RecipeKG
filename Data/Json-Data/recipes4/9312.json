I added slightly less molasses than the recipe called for, and the bread was still nicely sweet.  I'll be making this one again soon.\n\nUPDATE: I have also baked this bread in my oven, instead of a bread machine - no problems.  I routinely decrease the molasses to 1/3 cup, and use rolled oats instead of quick-cooking oats.  I use a mix of 2 cups white flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour when I have both available - no problems.",
