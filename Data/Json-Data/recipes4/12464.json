I think my fondant turned out great! I have never used it before so I was hesitant about which recipe to use. I am so glad I chose this one because I was terrified it wouldn't turn out and this did. It was super fun to make. My little hand mixer couldn't hold up to it but I figured that from the start. My hands worked just as well. I had to add a little extra powdered sugar but other than that I had no problems! Thanks for a great recipe that I will use over and over again!",

                "reviewBody": "Great Fondant recipe, and I've tried quite a few...for those reviewers that say it's too sticky, make sure you let it SET at least until room temperature...DON'T just add more and more sugar!  That is what makes it so crumbly when you go to use it (I made that mistake myself the first time trying this recipe).  If it's still even slightly warm from the gelatin mixture, it's NOT READY! \n   It has worked best for me to make it a day ahead, and tightly wrap in a couple layers of plastic wrap for the next day's use (I always put a TINY bit of shortening (like the size of a pearl) on my hands and then pat it into a ball before putting in plastic to keep it from drying out or sticking to the plastic).\n  As for COLORING, I use Wilton Gel Paste colors...just put a couple spots of color around your desired amoutn of fondant with a toothpick and knead it by hand (if fondant starts to stick to your hands, and it WILL, spread a tiny bit of shortening all over your hands and continue...I always do this several times).  Best technique I've found for totally blending in colors is stretching it repeatedly like taffy...if your fondant is the correct consistency you should be able to stretch it without breakage after softening by kneading it.  \n  Quick softening tip: rub fondant between hands into a cylindrical shape a couple of times...spreads your body heat quicker!\n  Don't be afraid of getting your hands a little dirty!  Happy Decorating!",
