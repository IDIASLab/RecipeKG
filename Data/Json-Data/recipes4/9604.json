I also used a food processor to cut in the butter which I used instead of shortening. I didnt have to use as much liquid as stated. I added a little bit at a time. After chilling the dough still seemed quite soft and I thought it was goin to be hard to work with but it wasn't. My aunt (walking cookbook and great pastry maker) has tried for years to bring my pastry up from just passable and failed. After eating a quiche made with this my dad said I'll tell Aunty Ellen you've finally made it. Thanks",

For the flakiest pastry, stop cutting in the shortening when it is about the size of a pea, no finer.  People who say the recipe didn't work for them, please remember that there are many variables when adding liquid to flour:  eggs aren't all the same size, and the humidity of the day will affect how much of the liquid mixture the flour will need.  Cut in the liquid a bit at a time, be patient, and when the dough comes together, just stop.",

I use a food processor for 'cutting' the shortening in-then mix in the liquid by hand-you have better control that way-and you won't overmix and make the crust tough.....  The results are spectacular-flaky, tender and easy to roll-even for the beginner.  Do agree with other reviewers-refrigerating the dough an hour or more always makes it easier to roll.",

And I love to bake and love a challenge, so why I did this for so long I cannot say. \nSo I used this wonderful site and all of your tips, and with this recipe I made an amazing crust. Could not have turned out better. Here are the tips I followed: \n1. Chill the bowl and the fat. 2. Do not \"over-cut\" the fat into the flour mix. You want some lumps-they make it flakey. 3.Chill the dough again while you make your filling. 4. MOST HELPFUL FOR ME: Roll the dough out ONCE and do so in between two sheets of wax paper. Remove one sheet and line up on pie plate, push into place and remove second sheet. \nDo not be afraid of pie crust like I was for way too long. These tips really ease the process and give wonderful results. No more tough dough stuck to the counters! ",

I followed it exactly as written except that I substituted half of the shortening with butter. I also needed to add one extra tablespoon of water to get the dough to come together. I was making it for a chicken pot pie so I stuck the dough in the fridge while I cooked up the rest of the ingredients. There was no problem rolling out the dough. It looked really pretty and for a moment I had high hopes for it. But when it came out of the oven the bottom crust was all soggy and doughy. The top crust was nice and crisp though I have to say that the flavor was completely unremarkable. I was hoping for something buttery and flaky. Instead it tasted like baked homemade play dough. I was so disappointed after all that work to make a chicken pot pie from scratch! At dinner time everyone ended up picking around the crust and only eating the chicken and vegetables. Even my dog wouldn't eat the crust so it all ended up in the trash bin. I'm sorry but I definitely will not be making this again!",
