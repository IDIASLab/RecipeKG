Distinctively garlicky, I wanted to try roasting it in my own kitchen but found few recipes. Here's my version. It's not spicy, but it has the garlic and thyme that meld to make the savory, regional flavor. We like to serve the beef on toasted rolls with garlic mayonnaise.",

I had a larger roast and it was over done at like 4 hours when I started to temp it. Start to temp this after two or three hours and it should come out ok. If you do over cook it just slice it up and put it in a pot with gravy and it will come out more moist and will be like pot roast. Then Add the original drippings to the gravy depending on how spicy you would like it. The flavor of this was REALLY great though! I highly recomned this just remember to temp it earlier than the recipe says.",
