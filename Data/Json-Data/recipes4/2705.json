Prepared the cauliflower and couscous as directed. I sauted garlic black pepper and chicken in margarine for about 2-4 minutes. Then I chopped some green onions and stirred this all together in an 8x8 pan. I added salt and more fresh ground black pepper before mixing in both mozzarella and cheddar. Probably about 2 cups? It was excellent. I would have liked plain I am sure but my bf is not a big couscous fan. Really great with leftovers or as a side to a flavorful dish.",
