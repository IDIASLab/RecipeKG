I have spent three years and Japan loving the fact I could drink real green tea without some berry honey or some other sweetener added. If you do not add the honey it does not take away from the natural sweetness of the Matcha. It took me awhile to get used to how sweet Matcha is but I love it and to add honey would just take it beyond sweet. Try it first without the honey trust me.. you will be pleasantly surprised!",
