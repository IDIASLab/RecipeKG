These completely avoid precooking the pasta and handling hot noodles.\r\n--Based on the amount of noodles I have, I do a slightly different layering sequence which adds more volume. [the amount of ricotta mixture still works I just use 1/3 of it for each layer instead of half.\r\n--Greasing the foil is a great reminder - hate to lose the cheese on top!",
