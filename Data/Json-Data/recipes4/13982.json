I would say it was even better the second day after letting the flavors blend overnight in the fridge. Will DEFINITELY make this again!",

I also tried the rice as some suggested but think it does better as a soup. Besides that I added fresh ginger a splash of white wine in with the garlic and onions and a pinch of red chili pepper. I tried adding ONE anchovy before simmering but actually think it could do with two (ended up adding a few drops of fish sauce as well). Shrimp and spinach should be added at the last minute. LOVELY recipe! Very flavourful. I'll be making this again. Curious to try it with vermicelli noodles but I'm convinced it works better as a soup.",
