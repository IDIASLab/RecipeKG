It offers an interesting flavor change from the usual gf recipes containing rice flour and potato/tapioca starch. My suggestion is to add a touch of salt and sweetener of your choice. If you don't have cornmeal you can use the same amount of corn flour - just add more liquid. I would make it again using a milk substitute.",

To help with the texture I ran the oats through my food processor (you could probably use oat flour too). They were good for gluten-free but if you don't have a wheat allergy I wouldn't bother.
