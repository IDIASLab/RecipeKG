                "reviewBody": "The idea is neat, put it's not really practical, in my opinion.  First of all, how can the recipe say '5 servings' when you can only make 2 cones from the 5 oz of cheese (at least that's what they did in the video).  Per one of the reviews, I patted the excess grease from both sides of the melted cheese as it cooled.  After rolling the cones, it would be a good idea to put something in the end of them (like a slender cup or small water bottle) to keep them from collapsing in the freezer.  But, if you don't, they won't be ruined.  They'll just be a bit more awkward to deal with when you're trying to fill them.  Speaking of filling them... They don't really hold that much, but I guess it would depend on how fat you rolled the cones.  In any case, by the time you're done with the whole thing, you've probably had enough.  Lastly, serve them immediately after filling them.  I filled my daughter's cone and called her down for dinner while I made mine.  (I had to stand hers up in a mug so the filling wouldn't fall out.)  She came down almost immediately and hers was sagging under its own weight.  The warm filling started to soften the cheese cone it quickly lost structural integrity.  Sadly, she had to eat hers with a fork because it was starting to fall apart.  Serve with plenty of paper towels or wrap the cones in a paper towel or two.  Even though I patted the excess off, there was still plenty left.  I really wanted to like this recipe, but it just didn't work out.",
