After reading comments I did the following to prepare my eggplant: sliced placed in a pan with about a tsp of heated olive oil and salted. When the oil had been soaked up and the eggplant had started to soften I added several Tablespoons of water. Then flipped and repeated with water. I tried it without the oil and it didn't work as well. My eggplant turned out golden and soft but was not mushy. I also used a round glass pan to accommidate for the shape of the eggplant. It worked perfectly! Thanks for the idea Natalie.",

Where the recipe went horribly wrong was the salting/sweating. Brushing the salt off didn't do the trick (and may have been too late) - the eggplant was WAY too salty - even for me a true salt lover. The reciepe is good in theory bad in direction. Definitely prep the eggplant with a different method! And this takes much more cooking time too.",
