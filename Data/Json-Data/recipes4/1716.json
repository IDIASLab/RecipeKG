I only made three changes: 1) used Tbsp of minced garlic instead of powder, 2) sauteed onions and garlic prior to adding chicken to the skillet, 3) upped the pineapple to 10oz (just because I really like pineapple). Tasted great!!! I will definitely make it again and perhaps add some sugar snaps and julienned carrots.",

I didn't add the mushrooms because I didn't have any but I loved the peppers...not too many for us at all. I used corn starch instead of flour to thicken it. I didn't marinade my chicken...just cooked it on the stove until cooked through and it was very tender and full of flavor. Thanks for the great recipe! PS - my younger son did think it was a little too spicy, so if you have younger children you could watch how much of the crushed pepper you add. But we liked it!",

I will only use half the pineapple juice next time, and 3/4 C teriyaki. I really liked the cooking method, I was skeptical of not sauteeing the veggies before adding the liquid, but this way they stayed fresh and crisp. I also used cornstarch instead of flour, and that gave me a nice glossy sauce (even though it was too much!). Will make again.",
