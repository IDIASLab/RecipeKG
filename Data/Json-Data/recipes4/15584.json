He'd simmer it down and serve it over hot buttered egg noodles. I gave it 4 stars because it was too salty for my tastes. Next time, I'm omitting the salt, as there is plenty in the onion soup mix and canned tomato sauce. I also use beef broth base, which is much lower in salt than bouillon. I don't use canned veggies, so I used fresh potatoes. Here's what I did:\n\n3 lbs stew meat, 1 1/2 lbs potatoes, 1 chopped onion, 2 cups carrots (I love carrots), 1 8oz can tomato sauce, 1 cup water, 1 small bottle (single serving size) of Gallo Cabernet Sauvignon and enough water to make 1 cup, 4 tsp Orrington Farms Beef Broth Base & Seasoning, 1 envelope dry onion soup mix, 1 tsp dried rosemary, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp of fresh ground black pepper, 1 small can of mushrooms, drained. You can thicken it with either corn starch or flour, as directed, but other methods such as using potato flakes like Potato Buds, or pulling out some of the potatoes, mashing them, and stirring them back into the broth work equally as well. I prefer to mash up some potatoes and stir into the broth, which is why I upped the quantity of potatoes.",

I substituted marjoram for rosemary and I made my own \"onion soup mix\" (using the Dry Onion Mix recipe found on this site but leaving out the bouillon granules). For veg I used fresh potatoes peeled and cut into small chunks fresh baby mushrooms cut in half and (because I didn't have fresh) tinned baby carrots which I sliced and held off adding until the last hour of cooking.
