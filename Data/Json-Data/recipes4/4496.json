Use spicy sausage if you like it hot.",

We froze leftovers and it was just as good after thawing again as it was the first time!",

My children raved about it, and enjoyed soaking up the broth with garlic toast. It was very easy,  hearty and delicious. There is definitely no need to add any salt, as the tomatoes and sausage add enough on their own.",
