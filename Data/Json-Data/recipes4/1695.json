I used tomatoes I had put up from my garden rather than canned (which doesn't necessarily make this any better if you use a good quality canned tomato) fresh dill rather than dried and no bay leaf. The dill flavor was not noticeable but this was delicious nonetheless. Hubs said it was reminiscent of a soup he really enjoys at the Purple Cafe and Wine Bar in downtown Seattle high praise indeed.",

Fresh-tasting and hearty this soup makes a terrific low fat and nutritious meal with some whole wheat crackers or warm crusty bread.
