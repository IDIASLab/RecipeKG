It is delicious and quite easy to make.  I made only minimal adjustments.  I used one large Vidalia onion, as opposed to two onions;  I was careful about the amount of cayenne I used (I figured I can always add more, but if I put in too much, I'll ruin the dish.  Half the amount called for was just right for us;) and I added 1  tsp. of ground cumin, because we are especially fond of that spice.  Otherwise, I made it as written. Highly recommended.
