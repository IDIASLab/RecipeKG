Good for a romantic dinner (you can skip the garlic) or to impress family and friends. This dish is really fun because you can customize it easily. For example, instead of prosciutto try sliced artichoke hearts, or try a different soft cheese on top. Make it more southwestern with pepperjack cheese, light beer, and bell peppers. Guys love it.",

We ended up with a lot of juice in the pan so next time I will drain that off when I add the cheese / prosciutto and make a quick pan sauce for pasta.  I will also add scallions as suggested by others.  You could use diced canned tomatoes too when fresh are tasteless.  I agree with another reviewer that there was too much pepper and oregano.  It makes an impressive yet easy company dinner with only a few small adjustments.",

I made this for an Italian themed family dinner family party of 10. Slight changes I made were to marinate the chicken in the oregano salt & pepper (and fresh Basil) overnight. The cooking time was almost bang on and they were tender and flavourful woot! Also and I almost did it this time but next time I would put the veggies in right from the start. The wine in the pan keeps them from sticking and likely burning as well. I also added shallots and big chunks of elephant garlic in with the veggies. Thanks so much for this amazing recipe.",
