I used a smaller but deep casserole so I put a little sauce in the bottom layer of ravioli veggies and sauce more ravioli and topped with the rest of the veggies and sauce and cheese. While I love traditional ratatouille I usually need to have something else with it as it's not too filling for me - the ravioli makes this a complete and delicious meal! Thanks for sharing!",

I added a yellow squash, too, because we didn't have quite enough zucchini.  This will go on permanent rotation.",

I left the peel on (it's full of anti-oxidants!)...especially since I used baby eggplants and their skin was not too tough. I also used fresh tomatoes (3 large) to cut down on the sodium and had to add a little bit of water because of it. I used fresh spinach ravioli instead of cheese ravioli. This is a really healthy and yummy dish. It tastes even better reheated the next day. ",

We had fresh basil and parsley so we used 3 tablespoons of each of those for the conversion from dried to fresh. We also tossed and coated the diced eggplant with salt for a half hour ahead of time, rinsed and dried it on paper towel. This closes the cells of the eggplant, which keeps it from soaking up the olive oil during cooking. Basically it keeps the eggplant from to becoming slimy. Other than using fresh herbs and prepping the eggplant we made it as directed, which resulted in a definitely make me again recipe!",
