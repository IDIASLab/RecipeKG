It may have been what was causing the finished product to be crumbly. I also don\u2019t understand the point of wrapping in foil, then unwrapping and poking holes in the meatThis may be an error, but every other recipe I\u2019ve made is cooked in the foil.  This could definitely be more stars if some tweaks were made with additional seasonings, and is a good base to build on.",
