                "reviewBody": "FANTASTIC! This was a great baked chicken. I changed some things to make it even more flavorful for us. For the breadcrumb mixture I substituted \"pepperidge farm herb stuffing\" instead of plain bread crumbs and also added 1 tsp oregano along with the basil. I used 4 large chicken breasts and used 4 tbsp olive oil and 2 cloves garlic. I also sprinkled a little salt and pepper on the chicken breasts before dipping them into the oil/garlic mixture. Oh to make this easier, use 2 pie pans for the dipping. It's so much easier than a bowl.. unless the chicken breasts are smaller or tenders. I did not think there was too much breadcrumb mixture as other reviewers said. I did have a little bit of each leftover (oil and breadcrumb), so I first drizzled what was left of the oil on the prepared chicken breasts in the pan, and then sprinkled what was left of the breadcrmb mixture over this. Then I sprinkled all of this with some garlic powder. It took about 40 minutes for the chicken to be done. It was SO MOIST and SO FLAVORFUL. Better and SO MUCH EASIER than my usual parmensan chicken recipe. WILL MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN. Thanks!",

Used 4 tbsps of olive oil and 2 tsps minced garlic. Put chicken breasts in a ziplock bag, added garlic, oil mixture, added 2 tsps adobo, 1 tsp each of salt & pepper, mixed well. Dipped the chicken pieces in the crumb/parmesan cheese mixture and baked for 40 minutes at 350 degrees. I've made similar recipes and they've lacked in flavor - this is the first time the flavor was perfect (in my opinion!) so I made sure to write it down this time!!

I pounded the breasts to ensure even and quick cooking and after they were baked (I cooked them at 375 degrees for 30 minutes)I put a little sun dried tomato pesto on top of each one and covered that with slices of mozza cheese.  I then put the pan under a hot broiler for a minute.  The only part that took any time was pounding the breasts.  I whipped this up for unexpected dinner guests and served it on a bed of rice pilaf on a large platter.  It tasted great and it looked impressive.  Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers.  Do try the panko crumbs if you can find them as they make a light crispy coating and the texture is more appealing than regular bread crumbs.",

We only eat chicken/ fish/veggies/grains and sometimes it gets boring.  I was completely amazed that this was so good!  I used a little more garlic, seasoned bread crumbs, and a dash of italian seasoning and season salt.  I also used a softer parmesan cheese that made all the difference.  Chicken was juicy and full of flavor.  By the way, organic chicken will always taste better!  Those in doubt..it is a keeper!",

But otherwise it was superb! It went well with mashes patatoes (my creativity) and DONT cover the pan with foil when baking because it will come out soggy. So leave it as is and sprinkle enough of the excess breadcrumbs over the top of the chicken. And the recipe calls for way too much breadcrumbs and after you dip the chicken in the breadcrumbs you MUST throw them away (contamination etc..) and that is a massive waste, USE YOUR DISCRETION.
