I let it cool for a few minutes and then flaked it with a fork and combined it with the other ingredients.  I also cut the puff pastry into smaller sections, as the packets get much bigger when they bake.  Some of my packs did split open, so I would probably fill them less and also try to rub some egg on the seam to make them stay together better when baking.   Overall it was delish!",
