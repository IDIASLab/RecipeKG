After everyone had taken theirs, i stirred italian seasoning and lots of parmesan into the leftovers, then spread it onto a (clean) styrofoam meat tray to chill.  Several days later i just cut into home-fry-sized pieces and baked at 450 on my baking stone.  We had an emergency so i forgot and probably left them in 25-30 minutes, but they were great! really really crispy on the outside, tender inside!  yum!",
