Don't use less liquid mash some of the beans then reintroduce them to the pot but this is to be done toward the last as needed. That is why you use so much liquid. It's the old fashioned seasoning way and it's good! Enjoy! Yes this is also better eaten the following day given time to give the flavors to ripen!",

I followed the recipe except for using Hillshire Farm Chicken Hardwood Smoked Sausage (seriously tastes just like smoked sausage) and used 1 lb instead of 2 lb (it was what I had on hand). This recipe does take some time but it s worth the effort. I think the timing is off on a few things. The beans will take longer to become soft and the vegetables will take less time to cook. I left this simmer for several hours the consistency ended up being perfect and although this recipe definitely is different this is a very good version of red beans and rice.",

The second time I made it I sauteed a chopped yellow onion and bell pepper with 2 chopped stalks of celery then added them to the pot. It rounded out the flavor. I reserved the chopped green onions to sprinkle over the top before serving. It was deserving of a 5th star after my changes. One note; the title says \"and Rice\" but the recipe doesn't contain or mention rice except in the title.",
