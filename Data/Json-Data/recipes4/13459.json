I found this recipe while looking for ways to polish of the aforementioned can. Had I found the dried variety in the first place I probably would never have made this recipe. I am glad I did find it because the flavors are complex and tasty! I diced one of the chipotles in adobo and left it in. There was a little too much liquid for my preference so I will add more peas or cut the amount of liquid next time. I also used chicken broth instead of water (and left out the boullion cube). While the color of the soup will probably keep it out of any food blogs it could be dresssed up with a sour cream/yogurt garnish for guests. I will definitely make this again!",
