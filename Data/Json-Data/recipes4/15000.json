You may think the ingredients are strange, but they come together perfectly. You may want to adjust the amounts to your taste. When cooking something like greens, eyeballing is the best measurement. The longer you cook these, the more the flavors mesh and the better they taste.",

I also used a small piece of smoked turkey I already had instead of buying liquid smoke and only 1/4 cup of peanut butter (my family loves it but I can't stand the stuff).The smell was mouthwatering and it was one of the first times everyone ate their veggies before anything else. A shockingly great recipe that may seem unusual but is well worth trying. An excellent change from the usual collard greens. Thanks.",

This was great because it was hearty and filling which is hard to find for fish recipes. I substituted Jerk seasoning for the Soul Food seasoning because it was what I had on-hand. It worked just great! I would definitely recommend sticking to medium heat as the recipe suggests; I was in a hurry and turned up the heat on my pot resulting in the dish sticking a bit to the bottom of the pan and overcooking just a bit. The greens tasted great though so no real harm done. Thank you so much!",
