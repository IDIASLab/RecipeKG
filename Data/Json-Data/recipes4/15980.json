I added an extra Tbsp of oil as well. This is a nice gluten free way to have a pancake to use as a wrap but they do break a bit. Large pancakes don't flip well so pay attention to make the right size enough to accommodate your spatula. The taste is simple and tastes like a rice pancake so it won't over power what you are eating. Having said that I used this for crespelle filled with ricotta and spinach topped with b\u00e9chamel it didn't hold up to having sauce poured over it and then baked. This would be a perfect pancake to use as a wrap or \"tortilla\" replacement. Leftovers baked well to form a taco shell or chip. Thank you kim for sharing your recipe.",
