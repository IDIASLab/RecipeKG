Was out of time to do the Crock-Pot version so just simmered it on the stove for an hour. Didn't have a jalapeno so used a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos and onions. Used 6 boneless thighs instead of 4 bone-in. Flavor and heat was wonderful! Just to add a touch of brightness and pop of complementary flavor, we sprinkled chopped cilantro on top of each serving. Served over rice and it was amazing!! I want to try it with andouille sausage next time! Thanks for posting!",

We loved this.\" Full disclosure: I followed the recipe except I used a can of Kirkland chicken instead of the chicken thighs and a chicken Andouille sausage instead of Italian sausage. Didn't substitute anything else though and we ate ours over faux-rice (food processor'ed cauliflower) with a baguette you know to appeal to starch-happy children who it turns out didn't mind that there was some heat in this gumbo. A pleasant tickle heat in the back of your throat not reach-for-your-drink fire. If it wasn't for the celery (that I should've known better and sauteed first) being a bit al dente and the roux taking more like 25 min. to develop that nice nutty color and aroma I would've given this 5 stars.",
