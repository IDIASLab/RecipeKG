I chopped it up and added it into the ingredients when everything was mixed together. (the noodles and the sauce). Everyone loved it and the celery added a nice crunch to it.  I added bread and a salad and it was an awesome, inexpensive meal!\n*UPDATE* I had my husband recreate the meal a few night ago, as I was busy.  His tasted a lot better....less salty.  The texture was a bit lighter too.  We found out later that evening that he forgot the sour cream and instead of using butter, he used extra virgin olive oil.  I prefer this to the original recipe.  He also added a can of corn, a can of sweet peas, and an extra half lb. of ground beef.  This gave us enough for seconds, lunches, and leftovers.  I believe the substitutes, additions, and omitting the sour cream made this recipe healthier.",

We've been struggling for a while to find a stroganoff recipe that she really likes.  This is complicated by the fact that she's not really a fan of sour cream.  Since this recipe called for a small amount of sour cream and no cream cheese, I picked it, and I'm glad I did:)\n\nAnyway, we were so impressed with how well it tasted for being such a simple recipe that I've already saved it away for later use.",

The soup is salty enough as it is garlic powder will work just fine and you can add salt if you feel it needs it. I also suggest omitting the flour step and draining the grease from the hamburger it seems the only purpose the flour serves is to soak up the grease plus just takes more work - i felt the end result was too thick anyway",
