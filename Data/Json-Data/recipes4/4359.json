But, I was looking for a \"base\" recipe to make turkey sliders, and this was perfect! I combined the ground turkey, garlic, panko, pepper and chili flakes. I made the patties and let them sit in the refrigerator for a few hours. Instead of cooking them in a pan, I threw them on the grill and basted them with a pomegranate-chipotle sauce. They were moist, flavorful and delicious! Going forward, this recipe is perfect to try different sauces, cheeses, etc. Thank you!",

The burgers were super tender and juicy so I like the pan frying with the white wine, though on the grill might be a bit healthier. Now, here is why this recipe received less than 5 stars. The goat cheese is quite prevalent and I felt overpowered the burgers. I AM a goat cheese lover, but it was just too strong. My husband isn't a huge fan of goat cheese so he didn't care for them. This is a great recipe otherwise, and next time I think I'll just omit the cheese or substitute.\r\nBy the way, a HUGE pet peeve of mine is when someone makes a big change to the recipe and then gives it a low rating. (i.e. \"I substituted brie.\" Well, of course it would taste bad, yuck!) Try this recipe and unless you love the strong goat cheese flavor, either cut it back, switch it out or omit it. :)",

I found it helpful to rub some olive oil on my hands before making the patties, otherwise they stuck to my fingers.  Will definitely be making these again!",
