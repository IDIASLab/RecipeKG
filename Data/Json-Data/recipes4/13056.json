I know alot of people say to make good paparikash you need to use bone in chicken, but i'm here to say that this was outstanding with bonless breast. I will be making this for years to come.

It is a totally different taste from Spanish which is what you typically get in grocery stores. It is worth the search as it really is the main flavor that defines Hungarian cuisine.",

I've altered my family recipe by removing the skin from the chicken (it gets flabby during the brazing)I dust the chicken lightly with flour and brown it in with the paprika, salt pepper and oil then ad chicken stock to braze. I remove my dumplings from the boiling pot after a 10-minute boil and put them into my large pan with the chicken. The starch fron the dumplings helps to thicken the sauce. (another reason to stir the sour cream just before serving or \"on the side\" some family members don't like sour cream, (yeah, I know?!) and leftovers..(yeah, I know?!) are easily reheated without the sour cream separating and making it greasy. (And buy the good hungarian paprika-it makes a difference). But otherwise, this is a good authentic version of paprikas!",

Never made dumplings before but they were good. I think I had too much dumpling and not enough sauce..either that or I cooked the chicken too long and reduced the liquid too much before adding the sour cream..I added water and it still was a little thick and seemed like not enough. Next time I will use a little more water and also add a little garlic when I add the onion to the chicken to cook and actually maybe increase the paprika a little (using the cheap stuff:-( ).
