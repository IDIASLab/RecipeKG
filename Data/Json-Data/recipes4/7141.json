That is why you should invest in an instant-read, digital meat thermometer. I will NOT cook without one. And another thing people don't\u00a0realize is that today's pork does NOT have to cook till it gets to 160 to 170 degrees F internal temperature. I like to serve these with some garlic smashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.",

The recipe is very simple to follow and also uses basic pantry items along with the option to use your own seasonings. The amount of  mayonnaise was spot on with no waste and the panko bread crumbs was, I thought, essential and stayed on very well! I did bake on cookie cooling rack on top of sheetpan,and I did not tent with foil,maybe that's why mine stayed crispy. Thanks gutpyle for a nice,tasty, moist and tender change of  pace recipe---it will be done many more times ****",

When they came out of the oven they looked great. The only issue was after sitting in the pan for 15 min with the aluminum foil all the bottoms started to get a bit soggy. They still tasted great though and everyone went back for more. My 21 mo old DD loved them (her first time trying pork chops). Glad I tried this Recipe Group selection--it's a keeper.",

I still put a healthy teaspoon in the mayo the chops need to be seasoned then the mayo and even the panko. Coating was soggy and wouldn't stay on the chops.
