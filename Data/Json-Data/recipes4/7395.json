Two things, though:  I thought this needed more crust, so I used two packages of crescent roll dough instead of one, and I didn't understand why it needed to chill overnight.  I didn't have the time to do that anyway, so I just baked.  It was almost gone by the end of the day, and I really enjoyed it, so I think it was a hit.  thanks for the recipe!",

Read the review about adding 2 crescent roll packages. I split the difference and put in 1 1/2 packages in each pan and found that to be more than enough crust (any more and I feel it would have been too overwhelming). I put in about 2/3rd of the cheese in the recipe because it looked like alot but in retrospect, I should have put in the full amount. I used the cheese pizza blend package that Kraft makes and it turned out well. People at work seem to really like it judging by the lack of leftovers. I served this with mixed berries and iced coffee for a complete breakfast.",

It cooked in the maximum time shown in original recipe perfectly. Also delicious with pico de gallo and avocado on top! DELICIOUS!!! This one is a keeper!!",
