I've been making my own almond milk for a few months thanks to another recipe on this website yet I wanted to try this because it adds dates and loved the idea of an unprocessed sweetener. This is a great way to have fresh, inexpensive and incomparable taste than any store bought almond milk. The nutrition from the dates alone should convince you to stop buying the store-bought, chemically sweetened/preserved version. Thanks for the recipe!",
