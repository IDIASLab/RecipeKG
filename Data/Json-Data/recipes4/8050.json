Experiment by adding your choice of nuts, flavored chocolate chips, and different flavor extracts. Top with icing if you wish. At Christmas, crushed candy canes and 1 1/2 teaspoons mint extract make for a nice holiday treat.",

This made the raw batter taste a little off but was delicious once baked. Also, I used a 8x8 glass dish and these were very \" skinny\" brownies. I would probably double the recipe next time. The baking times is accurate. Nice crispy/flaky top like wheat flour brownies. Give these a try.",
