I used honey instead of sucanat.  I also add one chopped green bellpepper and one can of diced tomatoes.  I cook the bellpepper and onion with my ground meat to be sure they are soft when the sauce is done.  I cooked the sauce in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours and low for another hour adding in the fresh sliced mushrooms for that last hour.  It was better than any store bought sauce I have ever tasted.  Froze the leftovers and had it for another meal.  Absolutely wonderful!",

The only change I made was using Italian seasoning instead of the separate herbs. I think I ended up using about 2 tablespoons of it. Adding the zucchini makes the sauce feel like a good hearty sauce but with just the small amount of meat it keeps it on the healthier side. Will make many many more times that's for sure!",
