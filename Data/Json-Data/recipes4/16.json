Use pickle SPEARS instead of slices. they stay crisper.\r\n\r\n2. Leave out the cornmeal. \r\n\r\n3. instead of saving most of the flour to dredge in, dump ALL ingredients into a bowl and wisk to make a smooth, THICK batter.\r\n\r\n4. dip pickle spears into batter, drop into hot oil, fry to golden brown.\r\n\r\n5. drain on paper toweling.\r\n\r\n6. try dipping in thousand island instead of ranch, YUMMY!\r\n\r\nfor the record, i used regular milk instead of buttermilk, i eyeballed the ingredients instead of measuring them, and i increased the hot pepper sauce a  bit to compensate for being out of cayenne pepper.\r\n\r\ni tested this recipe out so i could decide whether or not to bring it as a side dish to a BBQ later tonight... i'm on my way back to the store now to buy two more jars of pickles!",
