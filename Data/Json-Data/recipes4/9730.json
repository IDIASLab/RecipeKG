It tasted the way\r\nI always imagine and hope a Bloody Mary will taste though the few times I've\r\ntried them I was disappointed.\r\n\r\nUse RIPE tomatoes as it really does make a difference (I had just the usual \r\nunderwhelming grocery store tomatoes and set them in a sunny window for a \r\nfew days till they were red).  I knew they still weren't wonderful so used half \r\nfresh mixed with a can of chopped tomatoes in plain juice (skipped the \r\ntomato paste the recipe calls for as it seem a duplicate).\r\n\r\nI also had to substitue red wine vinegar for the white and didn't make all the \r\nextra toppings - but I did make bruscetta/croutons.  To avoid fuss, I just sliced \r\nbaguettes into longer diagonal slices and brushed them with a mixed up \r\ndressing of olive oil plus garden herbs (lots of oregano or marjoram, some \r\nthyme, a little rosemary) plus a pressed clove of garlic.  I put them on a rack \r\nunder the broiler for just a few minutes and they were a wonderful complimentary\r\nflavour (and it wasn't enough to warm up the kitchen!).\r\n\r\nIt made four generous servings.  We will definitely be making this again as all\r\nthe ingredients fit will fit the garden glut of tomatoes and peppers we predict!",
