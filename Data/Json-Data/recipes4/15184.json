It wasn't what I was hoping for. I served it to guests and eventhough they politely finished their plates no one had seconds:-( Needless to say I have a TON of leftovers. I decided to take my leftovers and turn it into a 5 star (to our tastes) dish. First off I made another sauce. I sauteed a mixture of red and green peppers and onions. I had a bag of frozen. Then I added more garlic tomato paste a healthy Tbsp of gochujang 1 1\\2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes 1 Tbsp. Better than Bouillion the water s&p 2 Tbsp Pri Pri and the paprika. It made A LOT of sauce so I used half of it to mix with the original dish. It was Great! I went heavy on the spices so it would come through more prominently and it was perfect. This was a total redo... Eventhough our guests liked it much better after the changes I won't be making it again. My \"changes\" were more than just adding more salt or spice. What I ened up having at the end was another recipe all together. Sorry.",
