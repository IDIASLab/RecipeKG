We didn't cook the celery with the onion and green pepper to add some additional crunch, but they could be cooked together.  We used reduced-fat ingredients throughout and had great success.  We found that there were no spices needed as the vegetables were a great flavor combination! This recipe ended up being a winner with everyone in the family!",

To cover evenly and nicely 1 & 1/2 package sleeves is what I had to use. Now that I have that out of the way. The recipe was nice. Not bad, the family thought it was good. I saw that it was rather watery when serving out portions. Possibly because I prepared everything the night before and placed in the frig until ready to bake. I felt the recipe could have used more ham with all the vegetables because the ham gets totally lost. Like playing hide and go seek, basically. And because I prepared the night before, the baking time was not right, the dish ended up being in the oven for 55-65 minutes because the potatoes were very hard before I could top with the crackers. Sooo you really need to watch this closely if you choose to do the same as I did in the preparations. As a whole, the recipe was fine. It's a comfort dish, not a wow dish for me. But it was tasty.

The recipe states to use 5 potatoes without mentioning what size and one onion without saying large onion or small. If I had used large potatoes then the casserole would never have fit into the baking dish. The recipe would be easier to follow if the size of the potatoes had been given. Overall the flavor was very good but next time I will pre-cook the potatoes as they were still very crunchy even after more than an hour of baking. Other than that I don't think I would make any changes.",

I used fresh broccoli and used thick-sliced crimini mushrooms. I used black forest ham. Even with that the recipe was overwhelmingly bland. I mean - you have white spuds white soup white cream cheese white monterey jack and white sour cream. It was not only bland but boring to look at. So I took the leftovers and added a lot more in the way of bell peppers - got the mini red/orange/yellow ones threw in more sauteed onion and garlic and a bunch more ham. Didn't feel like making white sauce like bechamel for moisture so i used a jar of alfredo sauce I had on hand. The reprise of this was SO much better and got far more enthusiastic reviews from my family and friends. So if you want yours to be tasty kick it up a notch. Food should be appealing to look at as well as flavorful and the original recipe was simply disappointing.",
