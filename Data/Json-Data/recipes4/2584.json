Changing the water will take the toot out of the beans. Also, be sure not to add the salt until the beans are almost cooked through. If you add it early, the beans will be tough. If using canned beans, you won't need to add salt as there is plenty in the beans already. ",

I omitted the cumin added chopped green bell pepper (half a pepper) and handful of chopped green onions (only because I had them on hand) and it smelled wonderful while it was cooking! I had to drain some of the liquid before mashing them (or the consistency wouldn't be thick enough). I tried a bowl w/ some shredded cheese on top and it was yummy! I'm sure it'll add special flavor to the Mexican 7-layer dip and taste better than canned beans. It is a very simple recipe; just a bit time consuming as it has to simmer a while but if you're home anyway it's no big deal. Loved this!",
