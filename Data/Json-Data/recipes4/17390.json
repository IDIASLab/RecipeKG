I completely forgot to make them until I was scrolling through my favorites last night and came across them again. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a tablespoon or two of pepitas (raw pumpkin seeds) in addition to the rest of the seeds. This is so versatile I want to make several different flavors! I did make the mistake of trying to use grease foil instead of parchment because I did not have any parchment. They stuck pretty badly but I was able to peel them off anyway. I used wax paper trickled with water to squish down the balls. Originally had planned on making a full sheet and cutting them with a pizza cutter glad I didn't because it would have been impossible. Lesson learned: if you don't have parchment best to stick them straight to the cookie sheet. Mine did not come out super crispy even in the second go around in the oven but they are still so good.",

Just took those out, started devouring them, and put the rest back in for a few.  Thanks for this recipe!!!!",
