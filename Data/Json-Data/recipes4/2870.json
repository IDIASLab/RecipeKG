I also tried sea salt, which was delicious.  However, when you make them, IGNORE the cooking time completely.  Stand there and just watch them.  When they are browned, crispy, and fragrant, they're done.  It took only 2 min. for mine to finish.",

I printed off the recipe just to try and he saw it and just marched off to the kitchen. These came out quite well, but we ended up cooking them on a greased plate, not on parchment paper as the chips did stick a bit. 8 mins is far too long though, we were cooking ours for 4 and a half mins and they were very evenly browned.  This could take a bit long if you wanted say a packet worth of chips, so good thing we just ate them while the next batch was cooking! Thanks for a fun recipe.",

It is also more time consuming. So, now I tried this method which proved to be the best. I just sliced the potato with my chips slicer, without peeling as in the picture. Sprayed my parchment paper with vegetable oil. Seasoned the chips. Placed the slices without overlaying or touching. Covered them with parchment. All they needed was about 4 minutes WHILE WATCHING THEM and checking on them every 1.5 minute or so. Once they are golden, that is it. They are healthy, delicious and quick, took 10 minutes from start to finish to make 2 small potatoes. I LOVE chips, but I try to avoid them since I like to keep fit and healthy. Now, I don't have to feel guilty. I am eating them while typing this review! YUMMY!\nA quick update, I have made this recipe a number of times and became an expert so I took it to class and taught my students and they gave their parents the recipe and they are all making home-made chips guilt-free! THANK YOU!",

Spray a plate with cooking spray and lay the chips hanging over the edge. This will give them a curl; then spray the chips and salt if desired. Cook for about 2 1/2 minutes and turn. No need to spray again. Continue cooking and turning every couple minutes until they appear done. It's important that you cook them until they are crispy or they will not taste good.
