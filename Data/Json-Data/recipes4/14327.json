Just wanted to share that I could not find turkey wings anywhere this year so I used a pack of two turkey drumsticks, and the gravy came out just as good as it always has!\n\nThis recipe was a life saver for me, I struggle with gravy and get so stressed out! I made this the day before Thanksgiving as I was prepping as much as I could for the meal. It roasted and simmered for hours and the house smelled just like a glorious turkey was in the oven. I did add some poultry seasoning to the blend. The gravy came out awesomely delicious and all I did at serving time was reheat in a saucepan and whisked in a spoonful or two of the turkey drippings from the roasting pan. Excellent recipe, thanks!",

I used a 1/2 a turkey breast as my local market didn't have wings OR legs, which made for less fat at the end.  I used a whole stick of butter to substitue and spelt flour for wheat allergic family members.  I think that gave it a nice, earthy flavor.  I also kept the onions from the roasting in the gravy for continued flavor.  I also used lots of fresh thyme as it grows in my kitchen.  I will keep and use this recipe again.  Very nice!",

Last year I was exhausted and smelly  by the time I was done making the gravy before Thanksgiving dinner. And for all my efforts the gravy was just so so.  This year I hoped to change up my game and made this recipe 3 days in advance then froze it and hoped for the best.  I doubled the amount and I had plenty of gravy (I had 25 for dinner).  The consistency was very velvety and smooth.  I used thighs instead of wings and got very little fat, but I thought that to be a good thing. It reheated beautifully and I received many compliments. It tasted very good and it was such a pleasureto have that step of dinner completed, made things much easier.  Will make again and again and share this recipe with everyone.",

I ended up having to add a package of gravy mix and additional pan drippings in. However! Having said that it was easily the best gravy I have ever tasted! I used most of a small Butterball turkey I had in the freezer (could not find wings anywhere!) but still did not get a lot of fat out of it. I had to use a lot of butter. SO because I cannot seem to make gravy out of turkey drippings I will probably use this recipe again. It did get rave reviews but it was a lot of work even when prepping the day before the big meal.",

I also used an immersion blender to blend the carmelized vegis into the finished gravy for even richer results. I also add the rec. turkey drippings just before serving. I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!!",

I'd give it 4.5 stars as I thought it needed some other seasoning beside S&P but I don't know what would improve the taste. This will definately be tradition from now on",

I just finished making it and I made it just like the recipe states.  It lacks flavor.  It is VERY flat and needs more seasoning.  I'm hoping when I add the turkey drippings it will taste better",
