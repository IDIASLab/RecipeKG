I had to use almost 4 tablespoons of vinegar to make the paste for the marinade. Also I didn't have the time to marinate the pork overnight which I admit was a BIG mistake!! After cooking the vindaloo curry was tasty but the pork hadn't really absorbed the flavours. The next day I dumped the whole lot into a slow cooker on medium also added an additional quarter cup vinegar and half cup water and let it stew for 3 hours. OMG that made such a difference. The pork meat absorbed the spices and tasted so good!! My advice.. Don't miss out on marinating the meat or if you do slow cook it later!!",
