I made half a batch (which made exactly 24) but still used a whole egg. I made my own oat flour by putting quick outs in the blender. I didn't have white chips so I used cinnamon chips and they worked fine. Mine took exactly 15 minutes. I think I've eaten 4 of these already and my 3 year-old has had a couple. I will make them again. Thanks for a nice recipe.",

I followed what one of the other reviewers did and made 1/2 recipe used the whole egg and still got 24. I used mini paper liners and they worked great. I made oat flour in my Vitamix. I then added the rest of the dry ingredients and processed it all well. I did not want large pieces of nuts or the other items. My only subtitute was 5 grain blend for the quinoa amount. I baked them for 21 minutes and noticed they do remain the same size as they went in. So it is okay to fill them well. Ty",
