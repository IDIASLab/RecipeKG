I used one pound of beef stew meat (pork was not on sale this week, but stew meat was) that I tenderized the heck out of and 8 oz. of quartered baby Bella mushrooms in place of the other pound of meat called for. When sauteing the onion, garlic and mushrooms together, I had to add a little butter in with the EVOO as the pan was a little dry with the added mushrooms. I served this with sour cream mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Insane flavor. I can't wait to try this with pork. NOTE: I had to use two different pans to saute, one for the onions, garlic and mushrooms and one for the beef. When I went to deglaze both pans, I used the cup of beef broth for one and the half cup of wine for the other. This way I didn't sacrifice any of the flavor because I had to cut the meat in half and use part mushrooms. Oh. Doi. I used beef broth instead of chicken.",
