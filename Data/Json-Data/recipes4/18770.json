Give it a go. The instructions may seem intensive, but once you've done it once you will see how easy this is and there are steps (the gravy, cooking the potatoes and onions) you can do ahead. It is a really tasty gravy and versatile. Even meat eaters like this, so experiment according to your tastes.",

I added a can of cannellini beans because my frozen carrot, corn, and peas blend already included lima beans and I used fresh steamed green beans instead of canned. I also topped with mashed potatoes (and a bit of smoked paprika) because I didn't have biscuit mix on hand and broiled at 500 degrees for 2 minutes (without the foil on top) at the end of the recommended cooking time. The cashew gravy was unexpectedly awesome and I cannot wait to use it on biscuits in the future. This would be a great vegan recipe to feed to naysayers. Very savory and tasty. The whole family loved it!",
