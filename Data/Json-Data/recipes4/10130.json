Added some red pepper flakes and used boxed cheese and spinach tortellini. Oh, and I put in a whole package of fresh baby spinach around 5 minutes before it was done.  This soup is great because you can add just about anything you like.  It was so delicious and filling.  This is a definite keeper in my house!",

I left out the tomatoes. I let it cook for a couple hours more. Kids loved it. It got left out overnight and I had to throw it out.:( Second batch I used chicken broth and cooked the sausage in the skillet. I put it in the crock pot again with the sauted veggies and instead of tomato sauce I just added a whole jar of spaghetti sauce! I left it thin enough to be a soup and the seasoning were enough to keep it tasting great. The second batch was a little oilier because of the cooking the sausage inside in a skillet rather than the grill. I think the flavor of sausage was better the first time but the spaghetti sauce worked great. Then second batch I",

In this instance I was able to add some beautiful rich juices left after slow cooking a beef roast yesterday with tomatoes red wine and beef broth. I also used quite a bit more sausage than the recipe directed. Unless your tomatoes are very red and ripe difficult in April I would suggest using a good canned tomato instead preferably San Marzano which is what I did today. I passed on the tomato sauce. I didn t have zucchini and I don t care for carrots (no I mean to say I hate carrots) so I didn t use them filling the gap instead with celery (the leaves too!) and baby spinach which I added toward the end. I used fresh oregano and basil because I was lucky enough to have it growing. I didn t have cheese tortellini (Hubs hates it) but I did have some cute little mini beef ravioli which filled in nicely. I cooked the ravioli separately then added it at the end so it wouldn t absorb too much broth. There is no right or wrong way to make this soup BUT to be authentic you MUST add the freshly grated Parmesan upon serving. I had intended to serve this tonight with a salad and Italian bread but we found this completely satisfying without either.",
