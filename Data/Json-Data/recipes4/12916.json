Don't get me wrong the chicken tasted good but it was fried according to my tastes. The sauce was way too tart almost to the point of bitterness--I had to add a little sugar to make it passable. The real shocker was the oranges--something must happen to them during cooking because they were a dead ringer for grapefruit. Yech. Couldn't eat 'em. Sorry but this one needs some work.",
