I would love to find a good recipe for a Greek Gyro to get the meat tender and moist like slow roasting does... this is not it.",

When I got home from work the edges of the chicken were not only brown but dry and cracking.. we were hungry so decided to salvage what we could. The remaining chicken had a dry consistency and and an odd texture. On top of the terrible texture of the chicken the spices used in the mixture did don't fare well with the cucumber sauce. It was like drinking a glass of koolaid and then a glass of milk... didn't work at all. I am very disappointed in this recipe without making major adjustments I just don't feel I'd ever make this again.:(",
