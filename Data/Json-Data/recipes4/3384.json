I stumbled across it and thought it looked like an interesting ground beef recipe & decided to give it a try! As I am the first reviewer I really tried to not alter it. However I detest celery so I did leave that out. I also was forced to use dried as opposed to fresh parsley. Everything else was the same (ok ok I couldn't resist adding more garlic as usual). It's pretty good! It was a little bland for my tastes but that could have been partially due to no celery and the dried parsley. I also used a sweeter red wine and I'm not sure how a merlot or cab would affect the flavor. I added some sea salt when I served it and that was a nice touch. Thanks Woman Whisking for a different way to use ground beef!",
