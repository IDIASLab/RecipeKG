However, it takes a certain amount of trust to make them.  Even if your mix looks and feels like a huge mistake, keep on going, and bake it.  The first time I made these, I did everything wrong, and they were still delicious.  Even my excessively carnivorous husband liked them.  These are great comfort food, and really stick to your ribs!",

Try this instead - mix all ingredients in a large bowl, except the wheat gluten, till smooth. Then add gluten to the bowl and mix with a spoon till most of the gluten is moist.

I happen to be very forgiving of any vegetarian \"meat\" substitutes; because it's been so long, I can hardly tell anymore that veggie burgers don't taste exactly like the real thing.  So I had high hopes for these, especially given all the positive reviews.  Unfortunately, they're not to my liking.  I wish I had something to compare them to, but the texture isn't like anything I've ever had before or ever care to try again.  Despite the attempts of the paprika and onion to add flavor, these taste like some kind of bland, chewy blob soaked in barbeque sauce.  Which makes me like barbeque sauce less, since it's meant to enhance flavor, not BE the only flavor.  I had some amazing vegetarian ribs at B. Smith's when I was visiting a friend in DC, but unfortunately I live in Milwaukee... and they were $19.  So I will continue searching for a recipe that calls for carmelized sweet potatoes, in the hope that it will be closer, since that's what those were made of.  If you're going to try these, I suggest cutting the recipe in half the first time, since it is a huge waste of a lot of expensive ingredients if it turns out you don't like them.",

I think the water really should be cut down to 2 cups instead of 3 cups. My dough was very wet and never once resembled the \"ball\" the recipe talks about. I had to drain a LOT of water and I felt like all my paprika was being washed down the drain! When I went to make the \"ribs\" there was no pulling or twisting going on with the dough...it was more like slopping it into the pan and hoping that it would dry out in the oven! I would also cut the amount of BBQ sauce to 1 or 1 1/2 cups...2 cups was way too much. Other than too-wet dough the flavor was really quite delicious and the texture would be better if I used less liquid. I will definitely give this one another try! Good luck....stick with it even if it seems like all hope is lost. They are very tasy.",
