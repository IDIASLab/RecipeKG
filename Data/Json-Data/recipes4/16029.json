The only down side is that it takes a while to prepare all the components.  I don't like crunchy onion in my food, so I thinly sliced and chopped the onion and sauteed it in butter first .  I also added a chopped hard boiled egg to the tuna mixture.  Because several people said the sauce was thin, I used 1/3 cup of the Bisquick and because I had a lot of American cheese slices I used 10 of them for the sauce, although I used cheddar in the filling mix.  The sauce was a nice consistency.  The recipe makes a lot of sauce!  We both liked the taste and texture and I would make it again if I had plenty of time.  Definitely worth giving a try if you're looking for something different!",
