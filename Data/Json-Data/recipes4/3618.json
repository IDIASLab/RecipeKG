EVERYONE in my family had seconds. Even my picky daughter who usually just eats the rice or pasta! I didn't use mushroom or broth since I didn't have any. (I used water instead.) I also doubled the recipe & used provolone on one pan because I didn't have enough Swiss. Both were excellent. I served it over brown rice with the fabulous sauce it made! Next time I probably will add some garlic & onion just for personal preference. I also made one other change: I baked it at 400 for about 35 minutes since I was short on time. By far the easiest delicious chicken ever!!",
