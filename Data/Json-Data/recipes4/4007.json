The only word of caution i have is don't let the beer reduce too much in the pan because it can get a VERY unpleasant bitter taste that pretty much ruins the stew.

I added small, quartered redskin potatoes to the bottm of the crock, sauted the bacon to about half cooked, then just added the beef and browned with the bacon, tossed bacon and beef over potatoes, and added my carrot and onions.  I used a 12 oz Guiness, and also added about a cup of beef broth.  I cooked 3 hours high, 4 hours low.  This stew was tender, flavorful, and delicious.  A fun St. Patricks Day dinner with plenty of leftovers.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Additional comments:  I've made this about 5 times since my review, I coat the beef with montreal seasoning, and use St. Peter's Cream Stout, has almost a sherry quality to it.",

Having gone thru so many now and recognizing our personal tastes, I did make a few adjustments right off the bat.  I went overboard on the garlic (it was pre-minced), the rosemary and marjoram.  Added a fair amount of dried thyme leaves (about 2-3 teaspoons worth), and went up to 1 1/2 teaspoons of allspice.  Also cut up a large celery stalk, and added 4 decent sized yukon gold potatoes (skin left on) when I added everything else.  Left it on high for 6 hours - and it was just bursting with flavor!   With this recipe being so easy - it can't be beat :)  A keeper!!!!",
