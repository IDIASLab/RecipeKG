Substituted brandy for sherry and lemon pepper seasoning for poultry seasoning, then cut out the mushrooms (husband hates them).  Then I added a can of tomatoes for some extra moisture and texture as well as some leftover cooked broccoli normandy.  Served with rice as suggested.  (I always add a bit of bouillon to the water when cooking rice.) I checked on the turkey every ten minutes, to flip it and stir all the additional vegetables.  This must have resulted in a lot of heat loss, because it took far longer to reach 165 degrees (over an hour) than the recipe said. Turned out deliciously -- very flavorful!",
