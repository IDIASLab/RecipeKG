My only change was to use chicken stock instead of water.  This would easily stretch to 8 blsl thighs, and I'm tempted to add some sliced zucchini about half way into the simmer time, when I make this again.   Leftovers would be an excellent lunch, if we had any!  Thanks for the recommendation, Baking Nana!",
