I've eaten a lot of Ethiopian food both in the States and in Ethiopia and was looking forward to making this for the first time with beets plucked right from the garden but I'll need to perk this particular one up a bit if it's going to be a repeat dish. I do think it has good potential with the right mix of added spice and am not ready to give up on it but as it is at least for us it was just okay.
