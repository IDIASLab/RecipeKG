So I recommend it! -Husband Note from \"wife\": I had to add more flour but it didn't seem to matter. This bread is GOOD! I used a.4 oz pack of ranch dressing because that is what I had on hand. Also something is wrong with the cooking time. After 20 min at 350 I realized that the bread was still very raw and hiked up the temp to 375 for 20 more min. So I recommend it!",

The only change I made was to use 3 tsp of bread machine yeast and to take it out about 30 minutes before the dough cycle completed. Measurements for all the other ingredients stayed the same. I was watching it so it wouldn't over flow while rising and taking it out 30 minutes early is just right. I shaped it into one braid and one regular loaf and put them into two 9 1/2 by 5 1/2 loaf pans let them rise 60 minutes then baked at 350 for 30 minutes. Delicious flavor great texture perfect warm with some butter also great grilled cheese and sandwich bread. Love the ranch flavor!",
