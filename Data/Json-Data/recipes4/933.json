We were out of beef broth so I used two beef granules in two and a half cups of water. I omitted the mushrooms and added chopped up green peppers. I also added an extra potato and more carrots. Because some complained about the potatoes not being done I \"par\" cooked the potatoes in the microwave (2 minutes covered in water-drained and added) I was out of teriyaki sauce so I made a simple substitute--a little bit of cooking sherry soy sauce ginger and garlic. It worked beautifully.. Also--to avoid the flour excess some spoke of brown your stew meat in the 1/4 cup of flour before adding it to the crock pot. The spices I included were garlic seasoning salt a pack of onion soup mix a pinch of ground cloves and patrika salt and pepper. Enjoy!",

                "reviewBody": "I had just turned on the full crock pot before I read the reviews.. that's not like me! But at least I did read them in time to add a little liquid. I added roughly 2/3 Cup of Beef Stock and 1/3 cup of Worchestershire Sause. I doubled the recipe, by the way.  The Texture of the stew was really good. It's thick and just the way I like stew. Except for the Potatoes. I cooked for 5 hours, 3 hours on high and 2 hours on low, and the potatoes were still a little crunchy. I used Baby Yellow Potatoes, cut into less approx. 1/2 inch peices (at their thickest points) So I thought for sure they would cook, but alas, they did not. So cook on high! And the BIGGEST complaint I had about this dish was the paprika. If you do not use large amounts of paprika on a regular basis... DO NOT ADD IT! you can add a tiny bit, like 1/4 of what's called for, but if you are not familiar with the acidic tart earthy flavor, you probably wont like tablespoons of it in your stew. And the liauid you add. You should make it Reduced Beef Stock. Which means Buy Beef stock, put it in a saucepan and boil gently until it is reduced down to the volume of the amount of liquid you want to add. It will be very strong, and that's ok. It has the job of basically flavoring the whole stew.",

I added about 1/4 cup more flour towards the end to make it thicker. Also I used 1 can of low sodium beef broth and 1 can of regular and it came out just fine with less sodium!

I took the advice and added 1tbsp worchestershire sauce an extra 1/2c beef broth reduced the paprika to 1/4tsp and about 2tbsp of lipton's onion soup mix a 1/4 tsp both of salt & pepper I added a bay leaf and added about 2tbsp corn starch at the end to thicken it up. It was WONDERFUL husband loved it definitely will make again.-------- It's been 3 years now and this is one of my favorite recipies ever! I've perfected it I still do everything the same just upped the wocersershire sauce to 2 1/2 tblsp and I've always doubled the veggies. It's so important that you layer everything by how long it takes to cook. I put the meat on the bottom then the potatos then the carrots with the mushrooms and celery on top. The slower and longer you cook it the more tender and flavorful everything is. I LOVE this recipe!!!!",

The only thing I changed was that I started dinner at 4pm so I didn't have 6 hours to cook. What I did was cook the meat 45 minutes on the stovetop with 4 cups water garlic and onion. Then drained the water added the mixture to coat the meat then added everything else as indicated in the receipe. And cooked it on medium heat for another 45 minutes. I made an easy 15 minute corn bread receipe. And dinner was on the table by 6:30pm. Thank you very much for the receipe this is the first time I used this website. I will definitely pass this receipe on and use your website again for more receipes.",

Also I used beef round steak b/c I had it on hand. BUT I would actually do it again - since the round steak was a bit thin and already tenderized little pieces of it \"floated off\" while cooking so every bite of the stew had beef in it. There were of course still big chunks throughout. Some people complained of a \"sweet funny taste\" - I thought it tasted perfect. I cooked it on low for 8 hours and it was perfect. Trust the recipe don't change anything except any vegetables you might like to take out or add.",
