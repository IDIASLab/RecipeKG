I didn't layer as indicated just mixed everything in a big bowl. It was a pretty thick mixture and thought about added 2 more eggs since the filling was going into two pie pans (using the same amount of ingredients) but stuck with 6 eggs. I added a few more dashes of Tobassco but you couldn't tell I added any. After it was done I let it stand for about 15 minutes before serving it for dinner. Added a Ceasar salad and had a great meal. The next time I make this I'm going to use 1/2 a package of bacon and 2 more eggs. Even though our family loves bacon it was a bit too much for this dish.",
