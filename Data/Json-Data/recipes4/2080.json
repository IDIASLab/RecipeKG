Comparing it to a cookbook of very traditional Mexican recipes I noticed that it is more authentic to use dried ancho and guajillo chiles all pork (pig head or hooves to be exact) and no cumin....but really there are as many ways to make a good pozole as there are cooks in Mexico! To avoid kind of tough chile skins in you soup strain the blended chile & chicken broth into the soup pot. Thanks for the recipe! It is traditional to have Pozole on New Year's Day so enjoy this great soup and..Feliz Ano Nuevo to you all!",

I signed up just to leave a comment about how lame everyone is that changes the recipe and then rate it badly (\"I couldn't find hominy at my local store\" or \"I've never heard of chicken in pozole before\"......really?!). There are many different pozole recipes and the taste varies greatly. I was looking not for a \"traditional\" recipe, but for one that did not require a 2 part cooking process and could cook unattended. To that end I found a very good base recipe. Will I make changes? Absolutely, but only because of my personal taste and will not penalize the author of this recipe with a bad rating. For everyone that finds that this recipe is, \"missing something\" that they, \"can't figure out\".....it's probably the marrow flavor that you're missing because this is a boneless recipe.",

We used chicken breast only white hominy only and reduced salt broths (salt to taste at the dinner table). Poured the pozole over mexican rice in a bowl and ate with corn tortillas - YUM! Not greasy at all. Will definitely make again with a few more tweaks. Couldn t give this 5 stars since we altered the ingredients.",
