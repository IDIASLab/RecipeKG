We used Rotelle because my 7 year old son picked the pasta and thought it looked cooler Apple smoked bacon more leek than the recipe suggests because the one I had was huge baby bellas and light sour cream. The cook time is not 20 minutes if you read the directions and it could take longer depending on your bacon. The parsley was good but I might try basil or a mix of fresh herbs next time.",
