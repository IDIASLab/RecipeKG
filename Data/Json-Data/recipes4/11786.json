His aunt makes rice balls for him every time we visit...but I have yet to get the recipe.  This one is very close.  I changed it quite a bit.  I use the \"Italian Meatballs\" recipe by JoAnn usually the night before I make the rice balls.  The next day I divide the leftover meatballs and divide them in 4ths.  When I form the rice ball, I put a bit of mozzarella cheese and the 1/4 of the meatball in the center.  The meatball is already flavored so I don't need to mess with ground beef prep on this recipe.  Sometimes I fry the rice balls but, for the most part, I usually just bake them.  They are artery clogging good fried.  But baked they are still good without adding even more oil to the mix.",
