I did make little bit of changes by adding some cooked breakfast sausage and bacon and I also used mixed rice (wild red brown and white) I couldn't find just plain wild rice. I did omit one bouillon cube so it is not too salty. Homemade croutons also makes it really good but not necessary. You can just buy the croutons in the store. Wonderful recipe.",

I made this stuffing and it was a raving success. The only thing I changed was instead of using Boullion I used broth from a box. It was great!! Thanks.",

This could be due to baking it in a dish and not in the bird (sorry I know waaaayyyy too much about microbiology to put my stuffing into the bird). I think the saltiness was due to the croutons I used. Next time I will use packaged dry bread cubes instead. Also I think the addition of italian sausage would be great as well as some red bell pepper for more color. I loved the nutty taste and texture of the wild rice with the soft bread of the croutons. Thanks for the great idea! I'll be playing with the recipe over the next few years to create a fabulous Thanksgiving side dish.",
