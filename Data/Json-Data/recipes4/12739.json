Also after I dug into this recipe I realized that I needed a pressure cooker. Oops! Well this was still wonderful. I was relieved to find that the meat was very tender still. Something with the flour on the meat before-hand makes it better. I used red potatos because I like the result better than russets. Served oversized mugs with a crusty hard roll. Very nice recipe. Thanks!",
