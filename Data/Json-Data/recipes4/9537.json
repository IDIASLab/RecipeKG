I didn't put the 2 cups of water in right away as I thought that would make it too wet to reduce properly. I put in 1 cup and added about 3/4 of the second cup during the simmer stage. I used Mozzarella cheese and put in some oregano basil and parsley toward the end. What emerged from this recipe was pasta with meatballs. The browned egg noodles didn't seem to do much. If I made it again I'd probably use slightly-parboiled rigatoni penne etc. I'd also skip the melting cheese but that's entirely personal preference. The reason I really enjoyed this recipe is that when you leave out the water-and-noodles routine is a very good and easy way to make tomato sauce with meatballs. No they're not nice round meatballs. But the perfect as they say is the enemy of the good. Use a lot of onion and the sugar in the onion plus the beef/sausage fat \"mellow\" the tomatoes into a really nice sauce. You could make this sauce and with some Mozzarella cheese have a great pizza topping. Or use the meatballs for sandwiches and reserve the tomato sauce for pasta. It's a really handy recipe thanks!",

I liked the browning of the noodles and also the Italian Sausage and ground beef patties but I had to make 4 patties instead of just 1 or 2 as listed in the recipe. I recommend not using a just cleaned stove top like I did as the drippings from the browned patties tends to pop all over the stove LOL! Other than that it was a good recipe...thanks so much Susanna!",
