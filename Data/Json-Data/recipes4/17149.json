Anyway what I had him do was buy the Ramen (10 for $3.00), 1/2 a rotisserie chicken, box of mushrooms. frozen peas, chicken stock and the spices (since he doesn't have ginger, onion powder and garlic powder).  we followed the directions, but just a teaspoon of the spices and a dash of salt and pepper.  But what we did was way out of left field, we added 1 cup chicken stock and 1 1/2 cup water.  we dumped a hand full of peas, mushrooms and shred the chicken breast and let it come to a boil.  Threw away the packet and added the top Ramen noodles for 3-5 min then served it up!  It was really good, he loved it and It took me back to simpler times.",
