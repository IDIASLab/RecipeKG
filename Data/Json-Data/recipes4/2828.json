I actually meant to write in the recipe to marinate for 1 to 2 hours and no more than 2.  I know lamb chops are an expensive cut of meat and what would be more disappointing than to over marinate and have them too salty.  Lastly, if I may suggest to anyone that loves middle-eastern food, I often add 1/8 teaspoon each: cinnamon, allspice and garam masala. They add a delicate flavor that is perfect with the lamb.  \n***I tried to submit with no stars and it wouldn't go thru, so I also give them 5 stars!***",

We loved these chops and so did our 2 and 5 year old children. They were super-easy to prepare. You HAVE to keep the onions and do this : make a little tray using two layers of  aluminum foil. Spray it with cooking spray and place (drained onions) on it and carefully place tray on grill, alongside the chops. We cooked our chops on med-hi for 8 mins. exactly and in that time the onions cooked and carmelized a bit and man, they were tasty. Next time I will at least double the onions, they were that good.\nAlso, I would not recommend leaving the chops in any longer than the 2 hours stated in the recipe.",

I usualy use a marinade of: plain yogurt, garlic/ginger paste, fried onions, lemon juice, 1TB oil, 1beef bullion cube, salt & pepper.  But I was looking for something different than  my usual. I prepared as the recipe stated, but only I marinated for an hr instead of 2 as per advice from reviewers and I baked in the oven (in an aluminum foil envelope) at 375 degrees instead of the grill, still the meat was so tender and very well seasoned. This is my menu choice for the month so will be making this for 3 more times on this months dinner menu and for special ocassions in the future. I also live in the Khaleej-UAE and hope to find more recipes posted by this cook. Thanks a million. ",

It was easy to make - I followed Noor's additional suggestion and added garam masala, allspice and cinnamon which gave an excellent flavour. Because I cooked the lamb on an indoor grill, and I wanted to use the onions as had been suggested, I removed the onions from the marinade and put them in a small skillet for about 10 minutes over medium heat to carmalize. I served them over the lamb chops - yummy. Super recipe Noor - and great added suggestion as well. ",
