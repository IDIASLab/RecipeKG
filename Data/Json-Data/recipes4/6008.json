Still as this recipe's first reviewer I couldn't be more pleased to say how much I enjoyed this. It has so many good things going on - chicken artichokes black olives zucchini. It would take a lot to make this dish go wrong! Given there is chicken in this \"salad \" I made a main dish of it. I also chose to serve it hot rather than chilled. I sauteed the chicken and zucchini separately adding fresh minced garlic salt and pepper. I combined that with the remaining ingredients along with some fresh chopped parsley and grape tomatoes. Score! It really was a flavorful medley of well-chosen compatible ingredients! Not sure I'd like this as much chilled but that of course could just be a subjective preference. I also think this would have been over the top tossed with a good pasta.",

Afterwards we served the leftovers wrapped in a warmed pita with some creamy dressing. Very good as a wrap too. Will make this again and again:)",

I used less of the veggie/salad ingredients because I wanted to make sure it was hearty enough for a main dish for two and even with two chicken breasts we easily had enough for four servings. I also served it warm because it seemed strange to have cold zucchini in a dish. But the next day I took leftovers for lunch and ate it cold and it was even better!

I tasted it as prepared and then I made some changes that made it out of this world for me and my family. I cut the zucchini into smaller cubes so that everything would be about the same size. I also seasoned the chicken breast with garlic powder and Mrs. Dash Italian Blend in addition to the salt and pepper. (It is my favorite!) Instead of grape or cherry tomatoes I used sun dried. This felt very Mediterranean, so I added some roasted red bell pepper strips. Both of these were the perfect addition.  Fresh Parmesan and a dash of bold olive oil did the trick. I have munched on this for two days with nothing additional and zero guilt.",
