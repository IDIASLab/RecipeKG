Then to amp it up a bit I added fire roasted tomatoes and red kidney beans until the ratio looked good. I used chicken stock instead of water. When it cooked down I added fresh cilantro. \nI know in the end I changed the recipe a lot, but it was a much better base than the mixes.",

I will use this easy recipe again. Thanks for posting.",

I followed the recipe exactly (hate those reviews when they tweak it) with the exception of the cayenne powder (optional) as I had an old bottle.  I will add it next time but liked it without it.  This is so easy to do - why buy the packaged?  Plus, don't know if anyone else has experienced this but I find no matter what brand I buy of the packaged that there is a moldy taste.  I've tried figuring out what seasoning is causing that.  I didn't detect that taste of mold with this homemade.  This is a little spicy but I like a little heat.  I use some avocado, sour cream, & mild taco sauce with my burritos, tacos, etc. so that reduces the heat. I will certainly keep a small batch made up in my pantry so it's ready to use although it only took a minute to mix it up.",
