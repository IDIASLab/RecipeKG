I used a 1-lb bag of prewashed and chopped collards, and a single can of chicken broth instead of all of the water and bouillon, stuffed into a 4-qt pot and stirred after about 5 minutes when it had time to wilt some. Twenty minutes was plenty of cooking time, leaving the collards a beautiful green and still intact, but not at all tough. Using less liquid made the flavors more intense, and I'm sure a whole lot less salty than 6 bouillon cubes! My teenager actually scraped his plate.",

There's no need for all that liquid collards have lots of water in them you only need about a half cup water to 1 pound of collards. If greens are tough add a little baking soda it will make them tender. This dish was delicious! It's different from the typical southern style but good",
