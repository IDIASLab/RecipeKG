I saut\u00e9ed the celery onion and garlic as in the recipe and added the broth (I used vegetable cuz that's all I had) but didn't add the rice to the mixture. I poured that into the baking dish. I also coated the chicken completely in the panko crumbs after removing from the bag. I then placed them in the broth mixture and baked uncovered at 375' for 35 minutes. I removed and sprinkled more panko and added the cheese as stated in the recipe and baked at 420' for an additional 10 minutes. I made the rice separately and served the chicken and sauce mixture on top. SCRUMPTIOUS! Thank you for this great recipe!",
