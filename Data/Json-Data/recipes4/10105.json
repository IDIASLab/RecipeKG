I doubled the amount of spinach and added a few crushed cloves of garlic to the butter when I was melting it to make the roux and about 1/2 cream after the roux had thickened to make it a bit creamer. You can also add 1 cup diced cooked artichoke hearts (or even the kind packed in water/oil) to make a spinach artichoke dip. Instead of garlic it is also really good with some nutmeg to make it taste Swedish.",
