The recipe is wonderful as written, but after experimenting, would suggest the following to change it up from time to time:  1)Increase the cheese to 3/4 cup using a mixture of Romano and Parmesan. 2)  Used 1 tsp of a good quality paprika (makes all the difference in the flavor of the finished dish) and 1 tsp smoky paprika.  3)   Added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.  4) Decrease butter to 1/8 cup based on the increase in cheese.  5)  Bake for 45 minutes tops otherwise the chicken dries out.

I will definitely make this again and will experiment with less butter and/or oil to get to the level we'd enjoy most. \n\nI used a really nice Pecorano Romano which I freshly grated using a medium hole grater so I got nice slivers of cheese. Definitely avoice processed \"fake\" parm cheese or pregrated stuff. The better your cheese is, the tastier this will be.",
