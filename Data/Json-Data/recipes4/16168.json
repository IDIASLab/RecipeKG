                "reviewBody": "This cookie presents very well. However I wish I would have add some type of natural apple extract of some sort to the cookie base. It is a very butter tasting cookie. The apple concentrate is more or less to hold the dough together. I rolled them into balls as suggested but as they bake they flatten out. I used a cookie scoop and got 19 cookies that I could actually bake all at once. I used 30 Lancaster caramels. When they were half way cooked down the liquid seemed like too much and I removed about 2 tbslp of the liquid and it was the right consistency. They may be a smaller caramel than what was called for in the recipe. I would very finely chop the walnuts they are the only ones that easily stuck. I baked them on parchment and when they were almost cooled I just left them on the sheet and drizzled over the caramel. it is a rather messy process and the last 5 or 6 started to have the toothpicks slide right out. I would actually try this again but add a natural apple extract or apple pie spice. I think a snowball type cookie base would be my choice too. Appearance wise though these are cute. I would like to see how others fare with this recipe and the changes they make to improve the flavor or texture.",

They taste more like a shortbread cookie with caramel and nuts. I did not experience the same thing as the others in that they did not flatten out. They stayed round. So I made a second batch and added applesauce to the batter. They flattened a little more but still held a good shape. But still didn't taste the apple very much. So I simply drizzled the caramel on top of that batch and I used chopped peanuts and sprinkled them on top. They were decent but need to find a different name for them. There was nothing \"apple\" about the flavor.",

So we scooped out a cookie, broke it in half, flattened slightly and then pressed the other half on it after we added a small bit of apple butter. They did not spread. We used a bit of caramel in a loaf melted with a tiny bit of whipping cream. Drizzled it over the cookies and rolled in chopped nuts. The apple butter did the trick. So cute!",
