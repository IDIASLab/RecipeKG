I would not recommend this if you do not like olives or an overall more sour type taste but if you do then you should definitely try this recipe. I make chicken pretty often and this was one which stands out from the rest. The taste of this is not what you would generally encounter w/ most chicken recipes. Boneless chicken will not work with this; have to use bone in cuts. The skin gives it a lot of the flavor because the sauce seems to attach itself particularily to the skin and falls into the crevices of where the bones are. When I was making this I thought 2 jars of artichokes were too much however I still used the 2 and it was just enough (an extra jar on top of that wouldn't hurt either). As I've done many times in different recipes I substituted Vermouth for the wine because it is extra dry and as a result adds more flavor. I substituted the canned olives for premium natural organic olives from a glass jar. I find they have more taste and are generally healthier. A",

I also love the suggestions people have, like sprinkling it with feta..or substituting rosemary or oregano.

I cooked fresh artichoke and removed the artichoke hearts myself for a fresh taste (this can take away from the easiness of the recipe however...). Then I chose to leave out the tarragon.

My mouth was watering thinking about making this but even after kicking it up a bit with parmesan cheese and extra herbs (rosemary basil) and plating it over angel hair pasta the flavor didn't thrill me. I only had skinless boneless chicken breasts on hand and quickly browned them prior to putting it all in the oven as I'm not a big fan of poached chicken but they were dry after only half the amount of cooking time suggested (baked 1/2 hour). I'm sure bone-in and skin-on chicken would improve the chicken flavor/texture but not necessarily the rest of the sauce. Mind you it wasn't bad just wasn't one I'd make again.",
