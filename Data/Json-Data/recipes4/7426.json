One note, the amount of milk you add will heavily depend on where you live, altitude, and humidity. I live in a dry, high altitude location so even though I halved the recipe, I used over a cup of milk to get the right consistency. The people that complain of a thin sauce either live at very low altitude or their roue wasn't cooked enough when they started adding the milk and cheese. Also, grainy mac and cheese is the result of adding the cheese too quickly. To ensure a smooth texture, add it slowly and melt completely before adding more, which the recipe didn't explain. If it's too thick, add more milk, and if you think it tastes like flour, you didn't cook the flour and butter for long enough, leaving it mostly raw. To remedy that you can carefully cook it for longer or start over.",
