First I always  double the recipe as it never lasts long and it's great as a leftover, so remember the following is for a double batch. In place of the tomato sauce I use a 28 oz. can of petite diced tomatoes drained (save the liquid)and a 6 oz. can of tomato paste.  I use 1 cup of the small pimento stuffed olives measured after chopping.  In addition to the raisins I add a 4.5 oz. box of pitted prunes chopped. A yellow or red bell pepper in place of the green. Add 1 cup of the liquid from the drained tomatoes to a small pot with 1/2 cup of Quinoa and cook as directed.  Once cook add to the other ingredients in Step 2 along with a small can of chopped Portobello mushrooms.  I like mine spicey but do as others have suggested and add the cayenne a little at a time or eliminate and use Rotel diced tomatoes with green chillis.",

However, my first try I was missing a few ingredients: bay leaves, cumin and cayenne pepper. I simply just added salt and pepper instead and it was delicious! \n\nHowever, during my second try, I actually used cayenne pepper and it was way too overpowering and spicy. I couldn't actually taste the picadillo. My advice is to try it without it and if you'd like a kick, slowly put cayenne until you reach your desired taste. I had to add brown sugar to offset the cayanne pepper. Overall, I will begin to actually cook lol and will begin making this more often. \n\nThank you so much for sharing!",
