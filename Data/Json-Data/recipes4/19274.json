Followed the recipe as written with the exception of cutting the amount of green onions in half. Two cups each of chopped onions and chopped green onions seemed excessive for the amount of orzo and rice and I would do the same thing in the future. The rice and orzo were good partners very mellow in flavor and did not overpower an expensive main course. This would be a nice side dish for chicken pork fish whatever. We enjoyed it with beautiful wild-caught sea scallops. Tricia McTamaney thanks for sharing your recipe.",
