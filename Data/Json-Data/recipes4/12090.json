After five hours on low I turned it up to high, stirred in about 2 Tbsp dissolved corn starch (I like thick sauce) and a tin of mandarine orange segments. By the time the rice was done, the sauce was nicely thickened. It tasted very soy-saucy to me, but was still very good and my husband really liked it, which is a big plus (he's picky). Super easy, I'll be making this again! Thanks!",

I made quite a few changes and it turned out wonderful (which is why the 4 stars). this is what I did: 1st I seasoned the chicken with s&p garlic powder and dusted in flour then deep fried till golden brown. Then I put drained chicken in crockpot with other ingred 2 heaping Tablespoons of orangejuice concentrate and 1/2 cup of honey. When the meal was finished I placed the chicken under the broiler until a bit crispy then dusted in toasted sesame seeds. It turned out delish this way!!!",
