We halved all of the ingredients so per another reviewer's suggestion I used 1/2 a cup of water - it was too much and never cooked off or absorbed all the way. I thought I was generous with the seasoning as we do with most things we cook but I still found it a little bland. We might make this again and next time use tomato sauce as another reviewer suggested in addition to the base ingredients.",
