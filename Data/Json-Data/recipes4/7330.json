I can understand that recipes can be very subjective to individual tastes, so an alteration or a variation expressed here can be very helpful. However, every recipe I try on here for the first time, I make exactly as the recipe calls for. I feel that gives the recipe and the cook a fair shake at what they are tasting. It also gives me a starting point after that, to try some of the alternative variations. So I'm perplexed at rude or negative comments that usually come from trying this recipe other than \"as called for\", then the reviewer says it's a terrible or less than desirable recipe, that they will never try again. However, if you hadn't made the recipe \"as called for\", it was then really your own recipe, and therefore should not reflect negatively on the author . That said, I found this recipe to be very delicious, but just a little to moist. My oven is a bit dated, so it could have been just not baked evenly. The next time I made this, I baked it for 40 minutes with the foil on. Then I took the foil off, and then let it bake for another 10 minute with the foil off. That seemed to  make the texture a little more crisp, which was more to my liking.  Great share. I will definitely be making this again!!!",

The decision to go way back 25+ years when I was a single Mom with boys making affordable meals, I was not sure how my meat and rice hearty eaters would like such a foreign dish. The added cheese put it over the wall. This dish was a homerun! How ya like my baseball references? I think it describes food just right!",

I mashed all of them in the bottom of the casserole dish and then took out about half maybe a little more of the mashed tots. Left just enough to form a layer on the bottom. After my beef was cooked and drained I added the soup mixture, poured it over the bottom later of tots and then spread the remain tots on top. I had some extra tots so I put a few whole tots along the edges and middle. I cook it on 400 for 40 minutes and then put the cheese on and cook for about 10 or 15 more minutes. For me, this made the tots crispier and not as soggy with the cheese cooking on them the whole time.",
