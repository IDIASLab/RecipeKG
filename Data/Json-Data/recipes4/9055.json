They like it served over rice because it makes a lot of 'gravy' that soaks into the rice. It 's one of my favorites because it's quick, easy, and has only a few ingredients that I usually have on hand.",

I also added a clove of minced garlic, oregano, salt and pepper to taste.  I would recommend less tomato sauce as it kind of overtakes the dish.  Next time I will try one 14.5 oz. can.  Served it with fresh bolillo rolls.  Final verdict is this is a really good meal and perfect for chilly fall evenings.  I liked it!",
