The adjustments I made were minor but for other cooks I'll list them. I made mine for 3 servings - used 1 cup of quinoa flakes since I only had 1/2 cup of panko - this was a very good addition. I used dried basil and did reduce salt by 1/2 teaspoon which I thought was just right. My provolone cheese was not the sharp kind - it was the smoked kind. The pomegranate molasses is a very nice flavorful touch and the recipe for making some is on this website. It lasts in the refrigerator for a long time kind of like simple syrup does. I had a great beer with it Blanche De Bruxelles - Biere Blanche White Beer. Yummy! Final note - this tastes close to a wonderful sandwich we have eaten at a local Mediterranean restaurant called Cafe Rakka in Hendersonville TN - which was featured on \"Diners Drive-Ins and Dives\" back in Oct. - except theirs is on pita bread. Again amazing - thank you Joenaujokas.",
