Instead of apricot preserves I used apricot \"simply fruit\" which may have been a little less sweet...it had the right amount of sweetness in the end. I also used canned apricots instead of dried which were juicier and may have made a little more sauce than originally intended. I added just a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce and served it with orzo pilaf and broccoli. Make sure to serve this with rice or pasta to go along with all of the sauce.",

It felt a little heavy on the thyme flavor but I suspect that is because I used dried instead of fresh thyme (reduced to 1 tsp.). Next time I will probably cut back on the thyme a little more if using dried. Overall unique easy recipe with an interesting mix of flavors.",
