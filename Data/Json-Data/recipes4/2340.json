My roommate who hates fish tried it and loved it. The honey carmelizes on the salmon making a satiny glaze. The cilantro in this pairs very well with the lime and surprisingly well with the honey which offers a very nice sweetness. This recipe is very fast it takes about 10 minutes to put together and is ready in another 10. Restaurant quality. We broiled ours for about 6 minutes per side which is what gave it the wonderful glaze.",

The marinade is perfect for salmon as the flavors mesh well together and still allow for the taste of the salmon to come through. It's light and healthy and tasty. I actually cooked the salmon in the oven at 400 for 18 minutes. The trick is to let the honey carmelize so that there is a glaze and a just-short-of-crunchy outer coating on the sides. Very good and will use not only for simple meal but for guests too!",

I then added some white wine and red pepper flakes to counteract the honey. Pour this mixture over the chicken before serving and it's out of this world. What a great summer dish.",
