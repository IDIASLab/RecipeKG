Lesson 1, use a huge pot!  My husband is NOT a kale fan, but he loved this and even packed a large bowl for his lunch today.  Changes I made: 1. I don't use MSG, so instead of Knorr bouillon + water, I used 8 c. of veggie broth (can use homemade or a good, cheap version like Trader Joe's).  I generously added Trocomare (organic leek/celery) salt as well as sea salt to help with flavor. 2. I didn't peel the potatoes before cubing and they were delicious.  Changes I'll make next time: 1. Add a bay leaf; 2. Half the dried parsley from 2 Tbsp down to 1 Tbsp. A wonderful soup recipe and an easy way to eat the superfood kale!          ",

I chose this recipe because of the reviews and because I had the ingredients on hand. I was not disappointed. This was a very tasty soup. I reduced the oil by half, and only used one large potato. That was plenty of potato for my tastes. Everything else I kept exactly as written and it was a very hearty soup. My one suggestion would be to cook it longer. Next time I will leave out the potatoes and beans for about 45 minutes. Then I will add them and cook for another 45 minutes. I just found my kale to be too tough after about 45  minutes of simmering.",
