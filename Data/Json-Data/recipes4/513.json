I personally, do not care much for it, unless however it is cooked in a manner that I do not know what it is! I am not alone in this feeling. My children take my side.  Venison tends to taste \"wild\" if you do not have a great recipe.  This is a GREAT recipe! We did not tell the kids what it was until after they all had thirds!! They were shocked as was I.  This was a very tasty and easy.  We will make this many time in the future.  Thanks so much! Now maybe I can clean out the freezer!",

For those that said this was too salty - use real garlic instead of the salt (or garlic powder) add a little water, and perhaps using low sodium soy sauce/cream of mushrooms soup would help a bunch as well.  Turned out great for us and w/ my changes, we didn't find it salty! Good luck & happy cooking!",

I then added it to the crock-pot about 20 minutes before serving. In the future I will not use the garlic SALT and maybe throw in a cup of sour cream at the end.

Even my son - who does not want anything to do with mushrooms loved it! I made french fries to go with the gravy and he poured the gravy all over his fries and venison! I will definitely make this again. One change I would make - I would use reduced sodium soup and garlic powder instead of salt. The onion soup mix has enough salt in it and I don't feel you need to add more. I did use liquid aminos since I was out of soy sauce but there isn't much difference in taste there anyway.",
