I omitted the chili powder because used HOT enchilada sauce and thought there would be enough spice (turned out great). This was simple and so delicious! Wonderful over rice to soak up that great sauce. Not very pretty to look at, so wouldn't serve to company though.",

I DO NOT LIKE IT WITH ANYTHING LESS THAN HEAVY CREAM.   \nThe ingredients from this recipe also can be used to make a DELICIOUS enchilada cassarole. \n\nSimply make a sauce using DOUBLE THE AMOUNTS OF the softened cream cheese, canned chiles, chili powder, enchilada sauce and heavy cream, ADD 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp onion powder. Mix together in a sauce pan and stir together until all cream cheese is melted and sauce is well mixed, \"don't cook sauce\".  Use 3 cups of chopped cooked chicken.  I use left over bbq'd chicken or a store bought rotisserie chicken and it works great.  Make alternate layers using 8-10 flour tortillas,  sauce, cheddar cheese, and chicken.  Finish top layer with cheese and some black olives and bake 35-40 mins at 350.   You can either use or omit the mushrooms for the enchiladas, I do use them chopped very small.  Use as much or as little of the sauce on the cassarole to your liking.  Let this rest before serving or it falls apart.  As with everything this recipe is always better the second day.  Serve with your favorite rice and beans and/or salad.",
