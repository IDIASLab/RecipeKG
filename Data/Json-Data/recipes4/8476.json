Instead of shredded mozzarella cheese I used the fresh soft mozzarella balls. They are too soft to shred so I diced them. I put a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan before putting the filled shells in. I put a cube of diced mozzarella in each shell  before filling with meat mixture.  These came out really good. Thanks for the recipe:)",

The second time my wife wanted to experiment a little, so we mixed ricotta cheese with a smaller portion of mozzarella cheese in the sausage. Used a dash of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick and added a little garlic power. Wow, this was perfect for us. My daughter\u2019s mother-in-law is Italian and makes shells every Christmas when we visit. Everyone thinks hers are the best. I guarantee these shells will give her a run for the money.

Marinara doesn't have Italian seasoning in it and regular sausage doesn't have Italian seasonings in it - therefore why use them only to add Italian seasoning?  \n\nMix pasta sauce in with the ground sausage 5 min. b/4 the sausage is fully cooked,  so it doesn't dry out in the oven.  If you spoon it into the shells while still hot, then add cheese, you only need to put it into the oven with \"no-foil\" for about 15 min (depending on y our stove) or until the cheese is melted.\n\nThis is a meal that you can put together fast, so it is great for weeknight meals.",
