I used frozen oj concentrate about 2 tablespoons in place of OJ. I added some dried rosemary with other herbs, I would have used fresh if I'd had it. I also used balsamic vinegar and loved the mellow flavor! Also I added 2 tbs.of cold butter to this finished sauce, I added it last by slowly whisking it in a pat at a time, it thickens the sauce and gives it that silky quality found in French cooking. Serve this over a bed of soft polenta and you have a restaurant quality dish to serve to guests!",

I grilled 6 bone-in thinner pork chops (had to make a little extra of the rub) - they had great flavor! I reduced my sauce a little too much, so watch that - it does thicken up upon cooling. Also, had no need for the olive oil, but used some butter in the sauce. I made 1 1/2 times the original recipe for the sauce & would like to just double it next time. Oh, and the only different ingredient I used was my favorite vinegar: White Balsamic Raspberry Blush Vinegar - My favorite (I could drink it! Well, maybe not). Served with mashed potatoes & sauteed baby zucchini(so cute on the plate!) - an excellent dinner!",

I just wanted to say that this sauce goes great with another amazing dish from this site (\"Pistachio Crusted Chicken\").  If you haven't tried nuts and chicken before, this is the best!!!  We also like to serve this dish with mashed potatoes since everyone wants a reason to use more sauce!  I HAVE made this recipe as state several times, and each time my husband says not to make it with pork again and rather eat it with chicken.  I agree, so I fry some seasoned chicken until browned then add the sauce! Give it a whirl, you'll thank me!!!",

I didn't double the vinegar, though, I used only 3 TBSP...this was still a bit too much, I think.  When tasting the sauce while cooking, I wondered how I could 'sweeten' it up a bit, and added a little more orange juice and just a little cornstarch to thicken.  It tasted sooooo much better with the chops rather than by itself.  I will definitely make this again soon, just reducing the amount of vinegar next time.  One more thing, I didn't really think it was necessary to keep the chops warm in the oven while making the sauce, I was afraid it would dry them out, I just put them on a plate and covered them tightly with foil, this worked out fine.  Very good recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "The vinegar was WAY too overpowering in this sauce. IF I make this again and that's a big if I will not use vinegar. Instead I'll use plain white wine. Granted I don't like vinegar on French fries or poured on anything straight. But I do cook with vinegar when it's called for in a recipe like this because I expect it will mostly disappear or meld into the flavors of the dish. That didn't happen here. This is basically a sweet raspberry vinaigrette on pork chops. I even added 2 tablespoons of butter as suggested by one reviewer to make it a richer sauce (and to tame the vinegar's strength). Still I found it too strong. Sorry! I had great hopes for this one but it was disappointing. I gave it a three stars because I don't like vinegar so I wanted to be fair in mentioning that and assuming some people may like it.",
