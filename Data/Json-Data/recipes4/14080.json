Since I used a very inexpensive beef cut I did marinate the 3lbs of beef with 1/2 cup of dry red wine a couple cloves of garlic diced and salt and pepper. I covered and placed in refrigerator for approx 3 hours. You may not ned to do this but Wow what a curry. I bought my curry powder roasted from my neighborhood Indian supply shop and served with a high quality basmati rice. I live in Australia and we are blessed with fantastic spice shops not sure how you would go in a small U.S mid-western town for supplies. Try this recipe if you can you will be delighted.",

                "reviewBody": "update 6/16: I've made this recipe several times and always with great results. Highly recommended and well received by many guests of varying familiarity/comfort with curry. I continue to omit pandan leaves use ground spices in lieu of whole (1 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp cardamom 1/4 tsp clove) so I don't have to fish out anything after cooking and use 3 tbsp of ginger garlic paste (equal parts garlic and ginger pureed together which I always have in my fridge). I still omit the coconut milk most of the time but I use coconut oil for sauteing to lend some of that flavor. I also still finish with about 1/3 cup chopped cilantro just because every curry I ate growing up was finished this way so I miss something if I don't have my cilantro. So glad I found this recipe! ----------------------- original reveiw: I feel a little funny reviewing when I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I hate it when people leave glowing reviews but didn't actually make the recipe. That said I was just making due with what I had on hand; thought I'd share so others won't be afraid to try. I didn't have pandan and I forgot the vinegar and I used ground cinnamon and cloves and used my own family's garam masala mix and finished with chopped cilantro. Also omitted the coconut milk just to reduce the calories. I made this in my pressure cooker which worked out well for a weeknight meal and served with brown rice. I'm Indian but beef curry is new territory since my extended family is Hin",
