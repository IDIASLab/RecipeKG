I also had some cooked brown rice so I used that instead of the white. I dredged the chicken in the flour mixture but only used about 1T of oil to saute things in. I just couldn't bring myself to use the full amount. I cut back on the amount of rice in each wrap and added in some sauted cabbage. I also toasted the coconut under the broiler before I added it to the wraps. I agree this needs some sort of a sauce so I think next time I make this I may make a yogurt/sour cream sauce with sme curry and garlic or something along those lines. This was a nice change of pace for my work lunches and it froze well. Thanks.",

The chicken marinated for only 45 minutes but it turned out fine. I added the coconut and green onion directly to the chicken mix when it was done cooking and used premade lime juice. I did not use anywhere near the full amount of veg. oil. Overall we thought this was tasty and very filling.",
