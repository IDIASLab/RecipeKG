I didn't have time to do the 24 hour marinade thing. I Cooked it as directed on time and temp and it was amazing. I basted it with the juices twice during cooking and my brisket was a 10lb one so I cooked it for 7 hours. My friend who is a chef said it is the best brisket he ever ate. It was so tender it fell apart. I had to cook it and let it cool completely before I could even slice it or it would fall apart. The key is always have enough liquid in the pan and keep it tightly covered and always cook low and slow. It was awesome!!",
