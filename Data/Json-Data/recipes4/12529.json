Maybe more anise and fresh mint would have made for a more noticable flavor? I also didn't think the lemon peel was enough to flavor the butter - you will probably need to add a little juice.",

I made the sauce with fresh mint (used a small-ish bunch that I removed after it had wilted down) and also added some lemon zest to the lemon butter. I brushed the cooked salmon with some reserved anise sauce before drizzling the lemon butter over the top. This turned out ok but it was rather a lot of work for pretty mediocre results. Oh well. Thanks anyway!",
