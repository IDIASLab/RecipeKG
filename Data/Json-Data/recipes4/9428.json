Moreover, the ingredients were quite easy to get hold of which is a plus. I thought at first that it might taste a bit too bland since you don't even marinate the chicken in any sauce, you just basically fry it and then add ingredients while cooking. But I guess the key to the taste is letting the chicken simmer in all that pepper and garlic.  The second time I tried it was not as successful -- think this is because I used too much oil.  So the key is to let it simmer in as little oil as possible so that by the time you put in the water, the water can evaporate so that the taste clings to the chicken. Happy cooking!",
