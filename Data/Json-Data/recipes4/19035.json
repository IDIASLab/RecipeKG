I didn't use habanero peppers because I know they are too hot for us, so just used a couple serrano. The \"serrano sauce\" was tasty, but the liquidness of it wasn't quite for me, so just used a slotted spoon for more chunks which seemed to work well. Served over rice and topped with avocado and cilantro. Next time I may skip the shrimp or use those tiny salad shrimp because they just seemed to get lost, but there will be a next time! Thank you so much for sharing a great recipe!",
