I also just went ahead and squeezed that lemon right into my tomato mixture. And oh yeah added a diced onion also...so did I invent a new recipe or am I rating the original?? At any rate the base of the recipe was not my own but I like to tweak everything with lots or garlic and onion. I also didn't know whether to cover with foil or not so I followed my normal baked fish recipe and covered with foil and baked for one hour (my fish was almost 6 lbs.) I peeked in after 45 minutes and found a little more water than I wanted so I uncovered it and it reduced nicely as we eat it with basmati rice and salad so we like a little sauce to put over the rice. I am trying to incorporate more baked fish in our diet and my whole family enjoyed this fish. Thanks!",

I made it even easier by using a can of seasoned diced tomatoes- just drizzled the fish in olive oil/pepper topped with the tomatoes and baked. I had 1 lb of trout from the grocery store so 1 14 oz can was plenty. Also it was cut thinner so 30 min was a bit too long will shorten the cooking time by 5-10 min next time.",

I don't like the taste of white wine at all so I opted for fresh squeezed lemon juice instead. Also I didn't have fresh parsley so I sprinkled a little Italian Seasonings on top of the tomatoes. And to avoid having to \"baste\" the fish during cooking I cooked it en papillote (wrapped in parchment paper). This allowed the juices to steam the fish and keep it moist without me having to keep opening the oven to baste (which lowers the temperature). Great job with the recipe Marilyn!:)",
