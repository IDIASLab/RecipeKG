Traditionally for this dish the chicken is cut into 16 pieces (usually by the butcher) but you can make it with bigger pieces as well. The spiciness of the dish can be varied by increasing or decreasing the amount of black pepper and green chile in the recipe to suit your taste.",

A few splashes of water can be added to give a light gravy... cook till meat is 3/4 cooked. stir in the cooked tomatoes to chicken. add chilies whole cover and cook on low heat about 10 minutes. uncover and add ginger and cilantro. stir till combined. add vinegar stir remove from heat and serve. NOW its a 5 star recipe... all pepers can be adjusted to liking jalapenos r better.",

That's not a great idea let me tell you. My peppercorns stayed virtually whole so I had to pick them out while I ate it. That would of course be my fault and not the recipe. I used one serrano and tasted it. IT WAS HOT! To save the meal I threw in a can of light coconut milk (my cure-all for asian recipes that get to spicy). It was very tasty. Next time I'll have a pepper grinder that works and I'll start with less hot pepper. Of course it was quite so delicious that I may add the coconut milk anyway.",
