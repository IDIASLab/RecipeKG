The second time, I did the following things to snaz it up: seasoned the beef with kosher salt, fresh cracked pepper, and garlic powder, browned the beef before adding it to the slow cooker, sauted 2 cups sliced mixed mushrooms and 1 onion sliced in the beef drippings before adding them to the slow cooker, deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup of red wine and added that also to the slow cooker, used 1/2 unsalted and 1/2 salted butter and then used low-salt soup mix to avoid all the saltiness.  I serve it over either egg noodles or mashed potatoes. It is now much requested in my house.",

After reading other reviews I decided to do a bit of tampering - browning beef first, adding mushrooms, garlic and onions and a bit of red wine. Oh my! It's even better. Also towards the end I added a packet of beef gravy to thicken it up. Was lovely over mashed potatoes. Will be making this again...and again...and... : )",

Served over white rice and with minted peas on the side.  This was the most tender beef I've ever had!!!",

I sometimes use a beef roast and after it is done cooking, shred the beef, put it back in the crock pot with all the \"gravy\" and let it simmer for about another 5 minutes.  This makes it extra moist, when sometimes in a crock pot the portion of meat not submerged in liquid can get over cooked.  I serve mine over my whipped potatoes. I am not a potato eater, but I will eat them with this wonderful beef on top.  Great recipe!",
