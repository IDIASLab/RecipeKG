Perfect for kids. Substitute the cavatappi with any full-bodied pasta, such as bow-tie, wagon-wheel, or mostaccioli.  You can even sneak in some frozen corn for a little tex-mex feel. Top it with cheese when serving.",

I did add some chopped green pepper to the onions and because I didn't have quite enough tomato sauce, I added in a can of petite diced tomatoes (undrained). The whole family devoured this! This chili has a nice, mild flavor that is perfect for any pallet (though, I am sure you could easily up the heat factor). I will def be making this quick and easy recipe again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",
