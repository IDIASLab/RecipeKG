But then i rarely follow a recipe exactly. THe way i made this is with the cut pork i placed in a saucepan slightly covered with water and simmered with salt until all water evaporated(it makes the pork more tender) Once all evaporated I added veg oil onion and jalapeno(with seeds cuz we like it hot) and salt pepper garlic powder cumin oregano. let fry until browned I added 2 small roma tomatoes coarsely chopped and about 1/4 cup of tomato sauce(im sure it would work great with the diced tomatoes like the recipe calls for I just didnt have any) I let cook until tomatoes were tender I added about 1/4 -1/2 cup of water and let simmer together. I didnt add mushrooms because my husband doesnt like them but it sure sounds good though.",
