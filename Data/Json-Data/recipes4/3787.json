                "reviewBody": "Not bad but pretty spicy and I cut back on the spicy ingredients. I cut the cayenne way down and only used jalapenos. I suppose it might've been cut more by the beer but I didn't add the beer to this. I also didn't add all the meats--just used bacon and pork--because I didn't have all of it. Did use the rub on the pork and instead of chopping it up (I used pork chops) I put the rub on seared it and plopped in the slow cooker as is. Once cooked and falling apart I just mashed at them with a spoon to get chunks of meat. Worked perfectly and helped me be lazy. I didn't add in the salsa as I thought all the other tomato based ingredients were plenty. Hubs and I prefer beans in our chili and although that may not be a purist preference for New Mexico chili (I haven't the slightest idea--I'm from Oregon) I'll add some next time. All in all adjust for spice if you are weird about it like I am and it works pretty well with adjustments to taste. Thanks for the recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "5 stars due to the dry seasoning alone - it truly carries the chili in my opinion (and maybe the beer?). MEAT: Dry seasoning is spectacular - the cocoa seemed to enhance the other seasonings and add a little twist. I had time to marinate meat for only a couple hours so I can imagine how much better after several. I only used ground beef and turkey due to cost of listed meats. Meat was also nicely \"tenderized\" so that any gristle was unnoticeable (the one barrier to my loving meat!). Bacon was perfect to round out the chili; I really think this could use more than 2 slices though. I did fry onions and meat in bacon grease as recommended - yummy!!! BASE: I like that this didn't taste \"canned\" to me. Found variety of ingredients and amounts pricey and possibly unnecessary since great results were achieved with substitutes - Pace Southwestern Chipotle with tomato sauce and extra paste as fillers instead of both salsa and picante. The rest I had. I did cut down on amount of garlic listed by half. Caution: Mr. Bill ain't kiddin' - this is hot and spicy so adjust accordingly! Lastly I forgot to add the beer - ugh!! Will certainly make this again (WITH beer). Thanks Mr. Bill! You have a flair for flavor!",
