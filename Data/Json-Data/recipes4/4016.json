I was out of cheddar cheese though and used shredded parmesan instead. I ended up using about 6 cups of bread with about 5 tablespoons of butter and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese (I wanted more bread on top). It smelled wonderful baking and tasted just as good. I think the toasty topping really added a lot--I would definitely recommend french bread. My husband and kids thought it was good but the kids don't like peas so I'm not going to hold that against the recipe. Very palatable!",

I cubed them up after defrosting and I used frozen spinach (thawed/drained). I did add additional spices as other reviews suggested. I found the ratio of butter to flour far to thick and had to add more milk and butter and whisk for quite awhile to break down the flour I should've used equal amounts to start with as it still turned out very thick after cooking I am however glad I used \"toasted\" bread as it would've been very gummy and too mucky. All in all it was worth trying and next time I'll stick to my own method of cooking white sauce instead.",
