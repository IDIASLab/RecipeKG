I've not only served it up as a main dish during the week, but I've served it as a side dish on the Thanksgiving table. It's got ham and cheese, but I think the secret ingredients are the half-and-half and eggs. Don't forget to cook the noodles with the chicken bouillon cubes for a really flavorful noodle. Enjoy!",

Made the recipe as written and baked up fine. I was a bit concerned with the finished texture of the Mac/Cheese it wasn't creamy cheese but more of a firm flan/custard like sauce after baking. There's not much \"cheese\" IN the recipe so much as its a topping. My husband enjoyed it and 1 of 2 boys did as well. I just couldn't get around the texture and lack of cheese in the sauce and lack of seasoning. I included Italian seasoning into this recipe so at least I'd be able to say its Italian Mac & Cheese.",
