I actually cut my pork into cubes and marinated in a ziplock bag for about 5 hours then sauteed them in a heavy skillet over medium high heat and then used the pork to make pork tacos - my wife and kids loved them - I will definetely do this again!!!",

If all those clues weren't enough, the one taste I had sealed it for me.  Somewhere along the line the taste of those beautiful Porterhouse chops got lost in the unpleasant tang of vinegar and lime juice.  I can't remember the last time I disliked something so much.",
