This was a BLT sandwich LUXE! Over the top good and quite pretty too. I used homemade Italian bread and I confess considerably more of ALL the ingredients than the submitter directed for each sandwich - like probably double. If you aren't as lucky as I was to happen to have leftover guacamole laying around I'm sure that avocado slices would be great too although the guacamole provides incredible flavor. The bacon is a \"gimme\" in my book as I think no matter what you use it for it makes it taste better! Combine that bacon with good bread the creaminess of the cream cheese more creaminess and flavor from the guacamole the crunchiness of the lettuce and the juiciness of a red-ripe tomato and you've got yourself one outstanding sandwich. I could easily see this as a wrap too either using tortillas or simply large lettuce leaves. So glad for the leftovers and search that led me to this recipe!",

Combining bacon, lettuce and tomato is just as classic a combination as peanut butter and jelly in my book. But, this combination of flavors and textures takes this classic to a whole new level! It's creamy and crunchy! I used thick cut smoked bacon, crisp iceburg lettuce, tomatoes seasoned with cracked black pepper, Philly whipped cream cheese, and \"Guacamole\" by Bob Cody from this site. I put it all on thick slices of toast. If you try this one, prepare your tastebuds for a treat. What a sandwich!",
