Right now, the large tomatoes in my area still aren't tasty, so I used the smaller Campari tomatoes. I just sprinkled the garlic and rosemary over the sliced tomatoes, drizzled the olive oil, gave them a sprinkle of freshly-ground pepper and salt, and into the oven.  The tomatoes just get sweeter as they bake, and they have nice presentation as well.  This was enjoyed as a side dish, and I see this one on our table often!",

These tomatoes which tasty were just a little too mooshy for me. I'd be glad to make them again make cutting the slices even thicker baking a shorter time or even broiling.
