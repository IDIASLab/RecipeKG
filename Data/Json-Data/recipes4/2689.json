In the slow cooker I placed the chicken (frozen), 1 cup of chicken broth, 1 tbsp of Italian spices and 1 tsp of fresh basil.  I cooked this on low for 3-4 hours.    I then sauted the onions and garlic in butter as directed.  I then removed all of the broth from the crock pot and placed it in the skillet along with the cream of chicken (low fat) and tsp of flour to thicken it up.  I then added the (light) cream cheese.  I placed the chicken back in the slow cooker and poured the sauce over it and cooked on low for an additional hour.  Wonderful recipe!!!  Thank you very much.  This one is a keeper!",

(I increased the chicken broth to 1 cup). Add the cream cheese the last 20 min of cooking and you're done! Very good even taking the shortcuts.   I've also tried this recipe & added 1/2 lb of fresh sliced mushrooms the last 10 min--great!  I've even used a homemade cream of chicken soup substitute in an attempt to make this healthier & I couldn't even tell the difference. I guess this is a no-fail recipe!",

I did what another reviewer suggested where I put in chicken (cut in pieces) with the butter and can of chicken broth and cooked on low for 6 hours.  I added carrots 4 hours into cooking.  After cooking the onions and garlic, I added the 1/2 cup of broth from the crockpot, the cream of chicken soup and cream cheese.  I also added frozen peas.  I also sauteed mushrooms in a separate pan, and added those to the crock pot as well.  I cooked this for an additional hour.  With the carrots, peas, and mushrooms it added great texture.  It is seriously delicious.  I will be making this again very soon!!",

We did add parmesan cheese on the top when plated. Served with vegetables. This may work for a longer time on low rather than the 3 hours on high for those who aren't home in the afternoon to start this for dinner. I'll post if I try it that way.",

I got this into the crockpot a little late today (around noon) which worked out well for me as the newer model I now have is a much faster cooker than my last early 70's model. This really didn't need more than four hours of cooking in my crockpot. I followed the recipe closely, only adding more garlic and after tasting the sauce (which was not more than chicken flavored cream cheese), basil, oregano and red pepper flake. Even with the spices, this recipe just wasn't a home run for us. It was not especially visually appetizing and just kind of.........just not a favorite. Sure it's easy but it's just not very good.
