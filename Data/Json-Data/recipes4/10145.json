I proofed the yeast with the honey and water mixed everything but the flours and cereal together and added that to the yeast then added the whole wheat flour half the white flour and the cereal (I used Bob's Red Mill 8 Grain). I added the rest of the white flour until the dough wasn't sticky (and I actually had to use about 1/2 cup more). I boiled some water in a kettle and then put the dough in a cold oven with the open kettle to rise since the warmth and humidity seems to make dough rise perfectly. Then I punched it down shaped it into two 1-pound loaves and let it rise again. I cooked it at 375 for about 20 minutes and had two perfect beautiful soft and delicious loaves. Thank you so much for the recipe!",

This bread tasted good but was a little dry sliced and used for sandwiches (it broke apart when holding the sandwich) but was great for toasting. I have a 2 lb. loaf machine and my bread overflowed the machine bucket and pressed up into the lid. Next time I will cut the ingredients by 1/4 and hope to get a full loaf without overflowing or I'll just cut the recipe in half for a small-medium loaf. The recipe doesn't note if the grain-cereal is hot (like oatmeal) or cold (not sure what this would be) so I used a 5 grain blend like oatmeal. When making bread it is important to use fresh (not expired) ingredients that were kept properly for success.",
