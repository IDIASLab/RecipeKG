We used three bags of light microwave popcorn a 7 oz. pkg. of Red Hots and added approx. 1 tsp. cinnamon oil. I love that you don't have to bake this recipe and it works just fine. If you like it warm and gooey eat right away; but if you like it crisy let it cool! Bravo to this winner of a recipe!",

My family and friends rate it as a favorite only problem is it disappears as fast as I can make it. Great for Christmas time! The only thing I do recommend is putting it on cookie sheets (spread out) and cook in oven @ 200degrees stirring every 15 min. for 1 Hr. total(This was part of my original recipe I had). It truelly takes away the stickiness and will disappear faster without as much of a mess. Love it!!",

I also took note of other reviewer's notes of \"stickiness\" and went ahead and boiled the candy to hard crack before pouring it on - which worked great. My only complaint is that it tasted more \"buttery\" than \"cinnamony\" maybe because I used real butter. The butter just overwhelmed the red hots. Maybe I will try a little less butter next time. Otherwise - it looked great! This would be awesome for Christmas!!",
