It would help to do as much prep work as possible before you actually go to assemble the casserole.  Thaw the hashbrowns in the fridge, grate the cheese, chop the green peppers, dice the bacon put the eggs on the counter to warm them to room temp etc.  But everyone liked it a lot!  I would probably add a couple more eggs to keep it moist, it was sort of dry (we don't use too much cheese and I used only two cups of cheese).  It would probably be good to add Rotel Diced tomatoes at the end to top it.  I'd make it again maybe try sausage and more eggs :)",
