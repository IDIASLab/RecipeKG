I did tweak it a bit to suit our tastes. Normally I would brown my meat first so I can drain the fat, but the recipe called for browning the meat along with the vegies, and no draining was mentioned. I did do that but then put everything in a colander to get rid of the fat. I added a green pepper, used red onion and in addition to the tomatos I used about half of a large can of tomato sauce. I also seasoned with garlic and onion powders, cayenne pepper and \"Essence\". Hubby is home alone every Wednesday night (poor guy. yeah, right) and was not only thrilled with his dinner but also with the \"Crunch Drop\" cookies I made this afternoon. (also on this site) I rarely see him eat desserts but he polished off quite a few! I'm always looking for different ways to use cabbage, as it's such a nutritious veggie and this was truly great. Thanks Susan!",

I added Old Bay and cajun seasoning to spice it up. I also added a small can of diced chili peppers as well as a half pkg of dried onion soup mix.  Since others said the rice may get mushy, I cooked my brown rice separately.  I used 1 cup of rice to 1 1/2 cup of water (instead of the usual 2 c water to 1 c rice) so that the rice would cook completely once added in the end.  Delicious!!  Update - I had not made this since I reviewed it in Oct 2006, but I made it again using Andouille sausage instead of smoked sausage.  Gave it lots of flavor and was truly delicious! Give it a try!",

Instead of garlic salt, I used Lawry's seasoning salt; for the sausage I had linguica on hand(Portugese sausage)and it was very good. Kielbasa would also be excellent. I scaled the recipe up so I would have leftovers. I recommend adding water (or perhaps spaghetti/tomato sauce diluted with water) when re-heating this. My family rated this a keeper.

I used this as the base for the Jambalayah, and it came out WOW!  I also used Italian Sausage instead of smoked, gave it a little extra kick, and added a bit more spices to perk it up a bit, I also left out the celery and added green peppers.  I am definately going to try this one again.  (Maybe after next time I do corned beef!) LOL...",
