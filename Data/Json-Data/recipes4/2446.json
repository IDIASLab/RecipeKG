I don't why but sometimes the simplest things just really hit the spot. No need for tons of vinegars and fancy wines all the time. I changed the method a bit. I minced the garlic stirred it in wit the olive oil and just let it 'hang out' for a while so the flavors could infuse. I didn't have fresh basil on hand so I just took about 1/2 tsp. of dried and mixed in the oil and garlic. I then too the tomato halves and gently tossed them with the oil mixture in a plastic bag and then poured into a shallow glass pie dish making sure to turn the cut side up. Then I seasoned with sale and fresh black pepper. I don't think I needed to roast mine the full time and they came out super yummy!",
