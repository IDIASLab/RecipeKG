This recipe has the added advantage that you can make ahead and freeze uncooked samosas, simply skip the egg brushing, freeze until you're ready and cook at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm, plain, or with chutney.",

We had way too much filling for the 4 pie shells, so we will cut back to two potatoes and maybe up the peas to a cup. We will also cut back just a little on the cayenne. Another way to describe how to fold is put the filling in the middle and bring the three corners to the top and pinch down the sides to seal them. If the dough isn't \"sealing\" well, add a little water to the edges of the triangle before you start the folding process.\nUpdate: We've also stopped peeling the potatoes. It saves time and we don't notice it at all.",
