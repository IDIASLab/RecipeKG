The only change I made was in the last 30 mins to an hour of cooking I add coconut milk which gives the sauce a wonderful creamy texture. I serve with brown rice naan bread mango chutney & chopped onions. Definitely a keeper. Thanks.",

I dredged the chicken in flour as others suggested, and used only 1/4 tsp. of the cayenne pepper because I was afraid my kids would think it was too spicy.  It turned out very well.  My husband had seconds and my 6 yr. old said I should make it again!",

Definitely: flour the chicken; add the coconut milk; increase the amount of curry powder and ginger. I also added a hefty dose of dried sage a couple of dashes of garlic powder and a couple of Tbsp dried onion flakes and served with jasmine rice from my smaller slow cooker (ratio of 1 cup rice to 1 1/4 cups water on Low for an hour or so). Even better the next day. Ethnic and comforting! Thx much.",

It kinda over powered the other flavors but over all it was a great dish!! (also i may add more currey next time it wasn't a very strong flavor. The sweet orange was the best!",

I loved it and it is the first time after a year of using recipes from this site that I have been motivated to leave a review. I always get annoyed at people who review a recipe and talk about the changes they made to it but I did make some changes to conform with my tastes and what I had on hand. Instead of the boneless skinless chicken breasts I used 2 large chicken breasts with bone and skin (about 2 lbs.). I also used a 15.5 oz. jar of marmalade (Publix low sugar no artificial sweetener) a little bit less than a cup of stock 1 Tbsp of curry powder 1/2 tsp of cayenne and no ginger. I cut 3 Yukon gold potatoes into eights and put those in the bottom of the slow cooker. Then I cut the breasts into thirds rubbed them with salt and pepper and put those in. I poured the other ingredients on top and then added a sliced large yellow onion and a chopped red pepper. I let it cook on low for 7 hours. The chicken was delicious but slightly dry; 6 hours would have probably been better. The skin and bones came right off. The sauce had a wonderful flavor. In fact I refrigerated the liquid skimmed off the fat and will use it to make rice. The most pleasant surprise was the flavor the onions and potatoes had. The onions were sweet/savory and the potatoes were like the perfect marriage between a potato and sweet potato. I love this recipe. It's a definite keeper for me!",

I say it that way because when I got home and lifted the lid on my crock pot the first thing I thought was oohhh this is way to sweet and I thought I have to cut back on that flavor somehow. I started off with the original recipe with the addition of the coconut milk right away (I wasn't going to be home 1 hour befor supper)I had also cut the cayenne way down to begin with so I added about 1/8 of a tsp. more at a time. I think I ended up with about 3/4 of a tsp. in total. The heat of the cayenne helps with the sweet of the jam I think. The other things I used to cut back on the sweet flavor were chopped onions and a tsp. or so of toasted cumin seeds. I know other had used garlic but I didn't want to stray too far from the original recipe. It does lack color if you serve it with white rice so I will serve it with a green veg. of some sort and a cucumber yogurt dip of some sort to cool the pallet. In the end I'm left with a sweet spicy dish that reminds me of India which I'm happy with and will make again. It took a bit but I'm happy with the result.",

It cooked a lot faster this way - probably about 3-4 hours on low. I also left out all of the spices except for the ginger since I didn't have them in the cupboard:). The sauce was a little runny but I didn't measure the ingredients exactly so I might have put a little too much chicken stock in. My family really liked the flavor. It was sweet but not too much.
