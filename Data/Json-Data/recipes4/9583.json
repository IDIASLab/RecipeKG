If you can change the 2 small carrots to 1 small turnip, this is the traditional ingredient. Carrots were added by non Cornish types. The very first pasties eaten by the tin miners of Cornwall were made as a meal in one and would have the meaty mix at one end and a sweet mix at the other. The pastie was created with a ridge of pastry down it's middle because tin mining was a dangerous and poisonous trade and the miner would hold the pastie by it's ridge which he would then throw away so as not to poison himself.",

The minors used to take them into the mine with them so they could just pull them out of their pocket and have a good meal while they were working.  Anyway I didn't really like the pasty they were very dry and didn't have a lot of flavor.  I remember the shell being very dry.  But these are very very good,the crust is light and flaky.  And it was a great compliment to the meat and vedges on the inside.  I used stu meat and that worked out great.  `Thanks for the great recipe it brought me back to my childhood and better.",
