Instead of using the dry red pepper I now use sriracha brand chili paste that gets mixed in after pulling the mustard seeds. Additionally I started using a tzatziki sauce (home-made--traditional recipe) as opposed to plain yogurt. I also tend to go a little more generous with the curry but that is a personal taste thing. This has been requested repeatedly by both roommates and my girlfriend since the initial trial. Great with any kind of Mediterranean or Indian dish.",

I have asafoetida powder which I thought would be the harder ingredient to find but no curry leaves. So I will need to try to buy some from Amazon to try this rice in all its glory. In the meantime the rice is still very tasty without the curry leaves and no substitution made. This recipe has frequented a few of my menus throughout the summer and I am sure it will continue to pop up frequently. Thank you!",
