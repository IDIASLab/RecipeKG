After I poured the boiling water onto the rice in the pan, I spread the rice to make sure it was level before I put it into the oven.\nAdded:  I have used this method to the exact recipe many many times now........perfect!   ADDED 01/08/19   So after making this to the recipe many times and having PERFECT rice EVERY TIME, I decided to experiment.  I have used chicken broth instead of water, have added in saute'ed onion and celery or frozen (thawed) mixed veggies, this recipe STILL comes out perfectly.    I also have used the leftovers to make confetti rice, fried rice, and skillet green pepper casserole.   I have frozen left over rice with success for later use.  Most versatile recipe I have come across on Allrecipes.  Update 2-22-20  Accidentally used Basmati rice, and it came out perfect also......",
