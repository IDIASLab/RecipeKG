I sauteed the onions celery and some garlic in butter before adding small dice of potato and covering with chicken stock plus a bay leaf. I pureed about half the cooked mixture because I like a chunky soup. I cut the kielbasa into 1/4\" half coins and sauteed them before adding the puree and remaining veggies. I don't use dry mixes but I like ranch dressing so added a few squirts to taste along with cream to desired consistency. Used fresh-cracked white pepper to taste.",

I tried adding a few but it didn't seem to help any.  Sorry, but this recipe makes a very bland soup (even after adding a TON of salt).  If your looking for a really good Potato soup recipe then type in \"Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup\" in the search tool...the submitter is \"Karena\".  It doesn't call for sausage but I don't see why you couldn't add it in there.  One word of caution...the \"Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup\" isn't a two step type of dish.  It takes a bit more work than this one but it's a much better recipe.  Happy cooking everyone!",
