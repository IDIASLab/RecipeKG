I sincerely doubt I'll ever again make \"traditional\" split pea soup.\n   This can be eaten as soup or, if you allow it to really thicken up, it makes a fantastic dip with crunchy tortilla strips, corn chips, toasted pita triangles, cucumber slices, or sweet red bell pepper strips. \n   I've also used it as a filling for pita along with chopped cucumbers and a drizzle of yogurt mixed with chopped mint. Scrumptious!\n\nNote:  Because I didn't have any dried whole chilies, I substituted 1 T. of commercial chili powder.  I've also used 1 T. of dried parsley in place of fresh, and that works okay, too, although fresh is best.  \n\nThank you for posting this recipe!",

With changes, this soup is delicious and so quick and easy.  quickly sauteed 5 large cloves of garlic in a bit of EVOO, upped the cumin to 2 heaping measuring tsp., omitted the whole chili and added Tunisian ground chili powder, and used chicken broth instead of water.  Used 3 cans chicken broth and 16 oz pkg of peas.  It was thick but not overly so.  I had an extra can of chicken broth that I added the next day, as it was thicker then.  thanks for the easy recipe that is nice to use for a Ramadan dinner shorba.",

But as a soup it's equally amazing. The only reason i'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because instead of water chicken broth is really essentail it emboldens the flavors and gives it a finished taste. Other than that this soup is perfect as is!",

I added a tiny bit of liquid smoke and some lemon juice to kind of brighten it. I think it needs more vegetables- like onion carrot and celery cooked with the garlic. Also leaving the dried red chili whole added no heat whatsoever. Lastly I wished I had used vegetable or chicken broth instead of plain water. I had such high hopes for this recipe but none of us liked it. Sorry.",
