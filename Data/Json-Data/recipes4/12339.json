I saute chopped carrot with the onion and use twice as much liquid as recipe calls for.  I also use 1/2 broth and 1/2 water, leave out added salt if using canned broth. I puree 1/2 the soup and leave the rest chunky. It's also great with fresh spinach thrown in near the end of cooking. Great flavor from the spices and makes the house smell great when it cooks. ",

Try adding 1/2 - 1 teaspoons each of tumeric and coriander for more spice.",
