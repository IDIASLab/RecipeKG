RICH, CREAMY, SATISFYING dish.  I did bake them in the avocado shell with the shells nestled in muffin tray.  The next day I had some left over and they looked a little dry so I spread a dollop of french onion dip.  Oh my, this really kicked it up a notch!  I think next time I make these I will add some of the french onion dip and cilantro as well. \nFinally, this fits into a low carb/keto diet with fat 25.2, protein 20.1, and carbs at 9.4.\nGreat recipe!",

Colby jack cheese (that\u2019s what I had on hand). I omitted ALL seasonings for dietary reasons. I completely shelled the avacodos & used the skins as bowls. \n\nLike others, i added cheese AFTER baking stuffed avacodos for 10mins.
