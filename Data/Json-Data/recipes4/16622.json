I coach a youth running program and I thought how funny to make brownies that were actually somewhat healthy for them. Most of the kids would be mortified to think they ate and liked black beans. Tried it out this am and it is AMAZING! Decadent tasting and chock full of fiber-filled, healthy beans! The kids will never know but I think I'll make the parents' April Fools Day by letting them in on my little culinary secret. These will become my go to brownie! Thank you! (make sure you mix the beans and water very thoroughly before adding the brownie mix - I used a blender for this then transferred into a mixer). What a great, secret recipe!",
