I skipped the mushrooms due to allergies and because of my potatoes i didn't need to add garlic or seasonings. i used mozzarella and a little sharp cheddar on top. This was a super turkey pizza. Me and my husband really liked it. My oldest son was not impressed but i will definitely make this again next year for me and my husband and whoever else is willing to take a try at something unconventional.",
