I couldn't find coconut milk powder but I found coconut powder and used that. I also could not find curry leaves so I used about 1 tsp of curry powder. I was a little confused by the recipe saying to add cayenne when it's not on the shopping list. I assumed it meant to add the paprika. I didn't have ginger garlic paste so I added about 1 clove of garlic and 1 tsp of fresh ginger. I also used fresh turmeric. I thought 1 whole lemon was too much considering it was already a bit bitter so I only added the juice from half of a lemon. Maybe it's the American in me but I thought this recipe lacked a little sweetness that I thought could bring out some other flavors. I added some white sugar and salt to taste. If I were to make again I would consider maybe adding coconut powder to coconut milk to add some natural sweetness and additional coconut flavor.",

Also couldn't find curry leaves so we looked up a recommendation of substituting it with basil and lime zest which work out well also. We substituted the chicken with shrimp and served it over penne. For some reason the recipe read to use cayenne pepper in the instructions but wasn't listed on the ingredients list (it read to use hot paprika). Love it and will make it again",
