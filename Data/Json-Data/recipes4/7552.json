Smoked paprika is one of my favorite spices so I don't know why it has never occurred to me to use it in salad like this! I did leave out the hard-boiled eggs only because well I felt like I spent all of this week (leading to Thanksgiving) in the kitchen and I did not want to boil eggs LOL. Other than that I followed this exactly and it was delicious! Another reviewer warned \"don't change\" the smoked paprika and she was right. Substituting regular paprika will not ruin it - I'm sure it would still be tasty - but you will be missing out. The smokiness takes it to another level. We already finished the first batch so I'll have to make more tomorrow. Yum!!",

The only substitution I had to make was using plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream because that's what I had on hand. It was very good and we will be enjoying this again tomorrow!:) Thanks for the nice recipe!",
