Also I always do a combination of dried fruit. I chop dried cherries blueberries apples cranberries and apricots and add them to a 1-cup measuring cup until it is full. It gives a nice variety of flavor. This is not a super sweet granola! The fruit provide most of the sweetness. Enjoy!",

Upped the cinnamon to almost a tablespoon kinda chewy finsih....and kinda bland due to lack of salt and no sweetness...next time I would add some brown sugar and maybe 2 tblspns of olive oil. Good potential and very healthy. Tasty in my yogurt today...just not the best recipe I have tried....but thanks!",
