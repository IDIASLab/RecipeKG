I considered a prior reviewer's comment that they were a bit salty so I decided to leave out the added salt entirely.  Rather than frying the meatballs in batches, I simply baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Finally, I just dropped the meatballs into the sauce and simmered everything together for 45 minutes.  This was excellent.  I would suggest cutting the amount of pancetta in half, however, because it was still a little salty; the only thing that marred an otherwise tasty treat. We served this with Awesome Rice Pilaf and Swiss Chard Sauteed with Lime, both recipes from this site as well. The combination of the three made for a memorable meal.",

Sorry but I substituted bacon for pancetta. That substitution didn't really figure into my rating. The dish was good; though I think I put high expectations on the dish with the exotic name and all the ingredients. I have made other red sauces before and this sauce didn t really seem all that different. The meatballs were denser that what I m used to and I really didn t taste the fresh oregano or Worcestershire. The wine in the sauce certainly made it sharp. I encourage people to try this recipe but for me it was too much fuss and the overall flavor seemed more Italian to me than Spanish or Mediterranean.",

Mexican albondigas soup has rice in the meatballs potatoes cilantro and mint instead of parsley no Worcestershire no celery and nothing is \"minced\" it's all very chunky.... at least in my experience. And a healthy dose of heat. When I saw this recipe randomly it seemed so weird I had to try it. I followed the recipe mostly added more garlic used bacon because pancettas hard to come by. It was very interesting. It's definitely nothing like the Mexican version but it's very good. This should get its own name it's very distinct. If I make it again I might try some olives in the soup and I think the aromatic herbs like thyme and mint are missing. I would also still add more garlic like I did this time. Thanks for sharing:)",

The other thing I normally do but forgot as followed the rest of the recipe to a tee is add the olive oil when you mix the meat mixture initially not in the pan. This way the meatballs stay really moist. Done in the pan they can dry out much more easily. Would do again for sure!",
