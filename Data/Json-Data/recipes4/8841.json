I love the \"crunch\" from the granola. These are great for breakfast or just about anytime of day when you're looking for a snack. Next time I might heat it up a bit in the microwave to get the peanut butter a little \"melty\". I also might add in some chocolate chips or sub a little jelly or jam for the honey. Overall very tasty yet simple recipe and a great way to for a peanut butter addict like me to get her \"fix\"! Thanks Mohawkmae!",

I use the whole banana and a plain flour wrap. This is a great on-the-go breakfast or lunch. It's healthy very filling and it sticks with you for hours. (And I'm not even a kid!)",
