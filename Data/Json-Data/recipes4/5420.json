I mixed a 1/2 cup mayo and mixed in about 1 -1 1/2 tsp Sriracha hot sauce, 1 tsp dijon mustard, and garlic salt. When the pasta was done I poured in the mayo sauce along with 2 cups of Cheddar Cheese and montrey Jack cheese but that didn't look like enough so I added a half can of cheddar cheese soup. Then I mixed in 2  cups of ham. I carmalized 1/2 onion, 1 tsp garlic, and pepper and mixed that in with the cheese, mayo and macaroni mixture. Topped with more shredded cheese.  Then I sprinkled on the lightly browned Italian bread crumbs. It was amazing and the family loved it!!",

I also had left over frozen ham from a family event so I was looking for a ham and cheese macaroni dish. This was the simplest. I boiled the left over ham got all useable meat off of it then boiled the noodles in the ham water (we had rotini). Added picked off bone bits of lean ham to the rotini and mixed. Instead of using mayonnaise (didn t have any) I heated about 2/3 cup milk melted the cubed cheese - used a whip utensil to blend then added cornstarch mixed in water first I used 1 teaspoon thickened a little more it seemed to need more so added another teaspoon it was thick and saucy. Mixed all ingredients in big bowl put in a casserole dish then it seemed the sauce was too thick it looked a little dry. I did maybe a third to a half cup of milk maybe 1 oz. more cheese and a little more of the cornstarch and water made a little more sauce a little wetter than the first batch poured it over the casserole had left over small amount of Monterey jack (no bread crumbson hand) sprinkled it intermittently on the casserole covered lightly with aluminum - baked at 325 about 30 minutes - turned out good! I baked at 325 as I also baked a cake that was needing 325 temp - both worked out fine.",
