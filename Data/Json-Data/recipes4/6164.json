I was looking for a recipe to cook lamb in the crock-pot as it is too hot to turn on the oven. They didn't peak my interest. I came across this recipe and thought it sounded good and it would work. I used coconut aminos instead of soy sauce. Cooked it on high for 4 hours in the crock-pot. It turned out more well done but it was moist and flavorful. Used the leftovers to make a gyro like salad with butter lettuce assorted cherry tomatoes white onion cucumber and my favorite homemade ranch dressing. Will also use this wet rub to use with boneless leg of lamb on the grill.",
