I also put some Franks Hot Sauce in it it gave it a nice tangy flavor. When I put it in my bowl I topped it with parmesan cheese and ate it with crusty sourdough bread. Wonderful!",

This is the kind of dish that you can experiment with different kinds of spices and vegetables as long as you get the water and oil proportions right.
