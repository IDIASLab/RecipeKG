I grew up with my great-grandmother\u2019s stroganoff using beef not hamburger.  Well, I was very pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  It was nice and creamy and delicious served over egg noodles.  I made a double batch so that we would have leftovers.  We actually liked this better the second day; the flavors seemed to be more prominent.   The one change I made was in the cooking time.  I only let the mixture simmer about 15 minutes rather than 1 hour.  I think the recipe would have lost the creaminess if it cooked for the entire hour.  Fifteen minutes worked well for me.",

Easy to put together and I did add a small can of sliced mushrooms, left the meat cook for about 1/2 hour on very low with the lid on and did add about 1/2 c. more broth to make sure I had enough sauce (love sauce). Added the sour cream and cream cheese right before serving and had a fabulous meal. When making meals that call for broth I do not use salt but do add to taste some boullion so not only do I add salt but more flavor too. Thanks Jarrie! This recipe is a keeper for me. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*) #Update# - had leftovers for lunch over toast served like an hot open faced sandwich and liked it even better than having it over noodles.",

That small bit of tomato in my usual recipe does add quite a bit to the flavor and of course the mushrooms. I am not a big fan of cream cheese so I eliminated that and increased the sour cream to 1/2 a cup and just cooked it until it reached the right consistency. I also cut back on the flour to about 2 tbs. Thanks for sharing Jarrie!",
