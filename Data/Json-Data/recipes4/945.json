I read many of the previous reviews and came up with additional suggestions.  I add potatoes, carrots and onions.  To give this recipe more spice, I rinse off the roast and sprinkle McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning on all sides of the roast before putting it into the slow cooker.  I mix together 1/2 of the can of mushroom soup, 1/2 of the dry onion soup mix and 1 cup water.  I pour this mixture over everything and sprinkle the rest of the onion soup mix on top of the roast.  I put several slices of the onion on top of the roast also.  I have used this recipe many, many times and it comes out perfect every time!  My husband loves it!!!",

I took a reviewers advice and doubled the receipe and added 2 packages of onion soup mix and I didn't have beef broth so I used 3 bullion cubes in 2 cups of hot water I couldn't believe how incredible this tasted. I don't even like cream of mushroom soup so I was scared at first but this was awsome and it made PLENTY of gravy to pour over our mashed potatoes and the roast. We all loved it and it is now going to be a regular meal at our house! I've been looking for over 5 yrs now for a great crock pot receipe for roasts and now I found it! ***UPDATE... I now make this all the time and I don't even use the mushroom soup anymore... One bag of onion soup, 2 bullion cubes and 1 cup of water w/ any roast you buy in the crock pot for 6 hr on high. I even strain the broth for the onions and make a gravy out of it to go over the roast and mashed potatoes. It's WONDERFUL both ways!",

I used two cans of mushroom soup, and one can of beef broth.  I rubbed the roast with onion salt (he HATES onions, otherwise, he's perfect), then poked holes in it and inserted whole cloves of garlic.  I added carrots and cabbage (I usually do the potatoes separately). I used about a 5 # roast, so it took 10 hours on low...and....well...it was AWESOME...fell APART in the pan...it was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted! Thanks for all the helpful hints..I'm off to slaughter a cow!",

I used golden mushroom soup instead of the cream of mushroom (that's what I had on hand).  Then added the veggies. People really liked it, but didn't go crazy over it.  \n\nSecond time around, I seemed to stick more to the recipe.  Seasoned with Montreal Steak Seasoning, garlic salt, and pepper.  Threw in two cans of cream of mushroom soup and half a box of beef broth.  Added carrots and onions.  A couple hours later added potatoes.  A half hour before serving, I measured out a 1/2 cup of the gravy broth and whisked in a couple tbsp. of flour, then stirred that back into the crock pot.  THIS TIME, my husband went nuts.  He had three servings.   He looked at me with sheer joy and worship in his eyes.  Isn't that what every spouse wants?   And it wasn't even hard to make!!!!",
