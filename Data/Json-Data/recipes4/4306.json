I'm not a mustard fan, so I was nervous, but decided to roll with the recipe minus alterations.  I agree that the mustard was a little over-powering in the sauce before cooking, but once the cheese melted though and worked its magic, the mustard faded into the background.  The entire thing came out MUCH better than I expected after tasting the sauce prior to cooking.  It was super easy and yummy.  Note:  The next day leftovers were kind of dry and disappointing, so you might want to make two small casseroles and bake separately if you're making two meals of it.",

However I tasted this before baking it and the mustard flavor was pretty overpowering so I added the rest of the cheese instead of putting it on top 1/2 - 1 cup of frozen peas (didn't measure) and approx. 1/4 cup of heavy cream to dilute the mustardy flavor. I then put some durkee french fried onions on the top. It came out really great although I would definitely decrease the mustard next time. With my changes I'd give it 5 stars but as written I'd say 4. My only complaint is that the directions do not tell you to bake covered or uncovered. I covered it but it could have been a bit warmer in the middle so maybe uncovered would have been better? Also next time I might throw in a touch more cheese:).",

I did have to add some evaporated milk to the casserole ingredients as it was quite thick we like a thinner macaroni casserole. I also added another half cup of mozzerella cheese to the casserole ingredients and some sauteed onion and garlic as well. I did not use the mustard only because I had so very little for lunches this week. I planned on making a cream base for this from scratch but I ran out of energy and ended up using the last can of mushroom soup in my pantry. My boys seemed to like this okay my littlest ate his whole serving which was a bonus as that kid complains about everything these days. This made enough for three hungry boys and a lunch for tomorrow. I thought it was good though next time I might doctor it up and maybe add a little hot sauce next time. It helped me use up pantry ingredients that I had on hand without spending extra money I don't have anyway. I appreciated that. This would be good with tuna instead of ham too.",
