My husband is not very adventurous and probably wouldn't have tried it if I had told him what it was before I set the plate in front of him. I just told him it was \"like pineapple fried rice but with a different grain\" and he gave it a go. He loved it which says a lot! My kids and I loved it too. It makes a lot or at least I thought but everyone wanted extra helpings so it didn't last long. I will definitely be making this again (and now I'll probably be able to get the hubby to try more quinoa dishes as well.) I made it exact to recipe except I used probably a full cup of canned crushed pineapple -- however much was in a standard size can. Crushed is the perfect size so you get some pineapple in each bite. This was fantastic and very easy and I will definitely be making it again.",

Heeding previous reviews I didn't used as much soy sauce as called for initially but really it needed that 1/4 cup; and I added a TBSP of canola oil because I didn't have enough peanut oil.
