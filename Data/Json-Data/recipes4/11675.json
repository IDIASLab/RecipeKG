In the end I wondered why I had taken such a long way around making some sausage and mashed taters with gravy. The mashers did not brown in the oven though I did wait patiently. Finally I pulled the dish out and realized that I really didn't have much to offer my family for dinner. So I threw together some biscuits baked 'em up and served the sausage stuff over open biscuits. In the end my family liked it \"for something different\" which is short for \"please don't make this again any time soon\". They don't have to worry; I won't.",
