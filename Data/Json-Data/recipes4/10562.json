The best part, I thought, was the frosting. I didn't have a whipped topping, so I substituted 1 cup heavy cream whipped together with the pudding and a couple pieces of crushed up pineapple with about 2 T. juice. It was delicious -- I made it three times in a row for three different events and everyone loved it. The best part is, it's easy, easy, easy! Some other combinations of cake mix and stir-ins that I tried were strawberry cake mix with pineapple and strawberry cake mix with mashed bananas. Both combinations were delicious. I thought the strawberry banana cake tasted best with vanilla pudding in the frosting. The strawberry pineapple cake tasted great with white chocolate pudding in the frosting.   ",

I used white cake mix instead of the pineapple flavored mix. All was well in the end even though my eggs were not as mixed in as they could have been;)",
