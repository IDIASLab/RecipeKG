I liked the idea of ricotta/parm/spinach instead of Alfredo or a red sauce, but I knew ahead of time I would have to tweak the recipe for my liking. I used a homemade whole wheat crust that I rolled thin and pre-baked for 8-10 min, used fresh torn spinach instead of frozen, and added about 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning to the ricotta mix. After smearing the mixture on the crust, I placed some grilled chicken, sliced green onions, mushrooms, and black olives. Topped with shredded mozzarella, then the sliced (Roma) tomatoes. When it came out of oven, I sprinkled a pinch each of oregano and crushed red pepper flakes. This might just be my new favorite pizza! I'm looking forward to trying the chopped artichoke next time as well!",
