I don't understand why mayonnaise is always added as an ingredient. It's unnecessary. Just ensure cream cheese is very soft. This doesn't yield a party size amount, so if entertaining, double.  More than 5 jalapenos are needed for a true jalapeno flavor. If you drain the bacon properly, won't be greasier. I mean it is a cheese dish. Some grease won't be avoided. I also season with a little garlic pepper.",

I used 10 medium size jalepenos with seeds, 2 more ounces cream cheese, 1 1/4 c cheddar cheese, and 3/4 c mozzerala.  We had no issues with the dip being greasy or even close to it.  Perfect dip for a large number of people.  If you are entertaining less than six, I would recommend cutting the recipe in half.  Will make this dip over and over, we loved it!!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is great! Just made it for football games yesterday and the family loved it. I did make a few alterations to accommodate what ingredients I had on hand; instead of green onions I grated about a quarter of a Spanish onion into the cheese mixture. I had no mozzarella cheese so I used all white cheddar and I added a few cloves of garlic because I'm incapable of making anything without a little garlic. I omitted the bacon because I failed to ration it and had to use what I had crisped for potato skins. I also used half mayonnaise and half sour cream simply because I like the tangy flavor of the sour cream. I made a half recipe but used 4 whole jalapenos because we like hot and spicy foods. Some reviewers have commented that this turned out greasy. I've noticed in my years of cooking experience that the quality of the ingredients specifically the cheddar cheese makes a huge difference. I made the mistake of preparing a family favorite casserole with a store brand shredded cheddar cheese and the end result was a very greasy dish that I found inedible. The other times I've made that same casserole I used a much better cheddar cheese and the dish was never greasy. A better cheese will give you a better end result and the price difference is negligible. I used Cabot Alpine Cheddar in this recipe and it was just delicious.",
