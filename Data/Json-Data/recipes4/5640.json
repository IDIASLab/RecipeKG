                "reviewBody": "This makes a very large salad great for a Sunday dinner for 5 to 6 people; the kalamata olives are the best part!. I have a few recommendations: If you don't have crusty bread use large croutons instead and if you don't have olive oil and red wine vinegar you can use Italian dressing. For the asparagus fill a bowl with water add ice cubes let that sit on the counter until the asparagus is boiled dump into the bowl after it is cooked. Use the pearl size mozzarella balls or cut them in half before mixing into the salad. Toss the salad with the dressing (omit the bread) let it sit in the fridge or table for 20 minutes or more and then toss the bread/croutons in at the very last minute. When the bread is mixed in early it gets very very mushy; if you intend to have leftovers it's best to store the salad without the bread/croutons mixed in. Sprinkle shaved Italian style cheese on top before serving. Meanwhile it's a very good mix of vegetables and a tasty delicious salad!",
