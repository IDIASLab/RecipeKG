Kept all the measurements as written except for the salt which I reduced to 1 tsp. and a handful of chopped parsley. I think if I had used 2# it would have been a bit bland but I like hearty flavors. I was leary of equal parts nutmeg and allspice but one did not overpower the other. Served over basmati rice w/peas and steamed garlic green beans. The potato picked up alot of the spice flavor which was nice. I think next time I will not bother to fry the potatoes just shred them instead and spread over top. All the components complimented the rice nicely. I was tempted to add an egg for fear that it would be dry and tough d/t using ground sirloin but it was not. I mixed the meat and let it set for about 2 hours for the flavors to blend and then proceeded with layering it and baking. Thank you for the interesting recipe.",

I poured the extra juice off halfway through cooking so that it still had enough not to dry out completely but wasn t swimming in house and grease from the meat at the end (since I used ground beef instead of lamb). I also drizzled some seasoned tomato sauce over the top of the vegetables before baking to give it some extra flavor. Will definitely make again!",
