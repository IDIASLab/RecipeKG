I adjusted the quantities to suit the amount of salmon I had, and thought it was delicious!  The peppers and seasonings add nice flavor that I haven't found in other salmon patty or salmon loaf recipes, but do not overwhelm the delicious flavor of the salmon.  Instead of making a loaf, I used cupcake tins.  Next time I may increase the oven temp, because I had to add time for it to be done.  We added some tzatziki dip and/or a little jalapeno Greek yogurt dip (from Costco) on the side, and it was yummy. Thanks for sharing!",
