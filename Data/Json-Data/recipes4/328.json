I had 3 lbs of lite kielbasa, 2 lbs of fresh bagged sauerkraut, (which I rinsed then squeezed out the excess water).  Because of that, I used 2 bottles of Miller Genuine draft, following others suggestions that darker beers were too overpowering of a flavor.  In the cockpot, I mixed about a tablespoon of grainy mustard with the beer, since I had no caraway seeds to try.  Added a squeeze of honey, some fresh cracked black pepper and 3 bay leaves.  Sauteed a small red onion, thinly sliced, and garlic in a pan, then added that.  Then sauteed the kielbasa until just starting to brown, then mixed that in and let it roll for 6 hours on low.  I found it not to be mushy at all, or the meat to be spongy at all, like some others complained of.  It was delicious, very filling and great for the rainy evening.  I served it in a bowl with some roasted garlic mashed potatoes and it had a really nice flavor.  Will definitely make this again. (Side note--used one of those crock pot liners, which is essentially a baking bag.  Easier clean up sounded great to me, but it busted!  I still got juice all in the pot.  Ah well, it was worth a try.)",

Usually he finds something he doesn't like about first-time recipes like 'too salty' etc. He did nothing but rave about it and had three helpings with mustard and tobasco on top throughout the day (a new record). I used Rogue Oregon Golden Ale which is a nice medium hoppy pale ale. (Sierra Nevada Pale Ale would also be good as well) He is all excited to try different beers in this recipe. I'll be making it often and it's SO easy. I set it on Low for 8 hours but stopped it after 5 1/2.",
