My husband loves hard boiled eggs and quite frankly so do I and nothing is more frustrating than something so simple turning out improper or down right ugly when doing deviled eggs or wanting something pretty to garnish a nice salad. I let the eggs come to room temp. to reduce cracking. When adding the eggs to the water I use a slotted spoon and gently place them into the pot this also helps to remove them. These were very easy to peel and the yolk has a nice rich yellow color. Thanks Ken!",

I've always used salt (supposed to prevent the contents leaking out) but the vinegar is news, and it works!  14 minutes is a bit long, I think; 10 minutes total boiling time will produce a less rubbery white and a creamy yolk, if you plunge the eggs into cold water immediately.  Also crack the shells immediately after putting the eggs in cold water.  This will allow the gas to escape which turns the yolk blue.",

Once the water comes to a boil, cook for 1-2 minutes, then turn off the heat and cover the pot with a lid. Let sit for 10-15 minutes depending on egg size. Drain water and cool immediately with cold water (I drop the eggs in bowl of ice water). Let them sit for a couple minutes and remove.",

My eggs were extra large so I boiled them the full 15 minutes but a couple extra minutes would have been better.  I would have had soft-boiled if I had taken the advise of one reviewer and only boiled for 10 minutes.  Like most of the other reviewers I recommend following the recipe exactly.
