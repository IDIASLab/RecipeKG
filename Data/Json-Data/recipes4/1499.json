We threw the cream cheese meat and jalapenos in a Kitchen Aid mixer and mixed it up until it was all nice and pink. This broke up the jalapenos a bit. We were a little concerned that the meat being mixed so much wouldn't patty well or hold together but we were wrong. Mixing it a lot also gave the burgers a really great light texture that brought out the flavors. We didn't have a grill at the time so we cooked the burgers in a skillet and they came out great. We wished we hadn't scaled down the recipe so we would have lots of left-overs.",
