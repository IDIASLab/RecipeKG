I only turned once to allow the crumbs to stick-on medium heat; about 3 minutes on each side.  They were great.",

I salted and peppered the pork before I put the panko mixture on.  For the panko I must say that I prefer the brands that come in the Asian aisle of the store rather than the domestic ones.  I was also surprised how well the coating stayed on the meat without anything to help it adhere.  I'll have to try that with other cuts of meat and chicken when I do similar things.  I don't have any idea how I could use a thermometer to tell if the meat was done because it's so thin!  I just use my best judgment!  It certainly doesn't take long!  Remember that pork should NOT be overcooked.  I will maybe not make the mustard sauce the way it's recommended here.  See that recipe for my thoughts on that.  I'll make this again for sure!",
