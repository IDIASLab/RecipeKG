I suggest storing them with apple slices so they don't dry out. 1 package of Graham Crackers makes about 1 1/2 cups so I used all of those and added half a cup of Nutella. I also added a Tbsp of cinnamon which REALLY helped draw out the nutty flavor. Even with the addition of ingredients I only got 24 small cookies but they were perfectly delicious! In the future I'll use 2 cups of Nutella and add some chopped hazelnuts and chocolate chips to the mix! Thanks for the yummy dish!",

They spread a lot probably due to the oils in the Nutella so space them out on your cookie sheet. I was fine with six per sheet. Thanks for the recipe!",
