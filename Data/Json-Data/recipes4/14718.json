I will add that I use  Sweet Marsala as opposed to the Dry Marsala and use more crushed garlic.\n\nAlso, you can place the cooked chicken breasts into a baking pan and then top with the sauce and place in the oven, covered, for approxiamtely 20 minutes at 325 degrees; an alternative to the stove top method.",

Didn't need the whole cup of flour, maybe 1/2? \n\nI didn't have any white rice, so I doubled the gravy and served on a platter of egg noodles.\n\nI was multi-tasking, so I went with one of the reviewers suggestions and put in a baking dish in the oven for 25 mins. I Don't Think I'll do that again. While the chicken Was Tender and flavorful, it caused the breading to have a slightly \"Wet/Rubbery\" texture. Next time, I'll try the original skillet method.\n\nThis is just me nit-picking tho. The recipe is Definately a Keeper!",

I did not need the whole 1 C of flour. Two words of caution when making this recipe. 1. cut your chicken breasts thinly - I had to flip my thicker breasts several times which caused them to lose their coating. 2. I used canned broth and even though it was reduced sodium I'm glad I tasted the sauce before salting to taste - otherwise it would have been too salty for me.",

The sauce was lacking flavor and my husband and I both thought it was too \"winey.\" I'm going to try it again using a bit less wine more chicken stock and some ground mustard parsley and garlic powder with a splash of whole milk. Other recipes use a bit of ground mustard and garlic powder so maybe that will give it more depth of flavor. I did serve it with angel hair pasta which we liked. White rice plays hell with my Type 1 Diabetic husband but for some reason he handles a bit on angel hair better.",
