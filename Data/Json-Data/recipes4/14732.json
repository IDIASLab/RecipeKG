I roasted my fennel and leek to bring out the natural flavors and then added 3 cups of homemade chicken stock. I brought it to just below a boil and then let it simmer for about 2 hours. I did think it could benefit from some S&P but the actual recipe calls for a bullion cube so that may have taken care of that. There is no strong licorice flavor which I feared. It is just a light vegetable soup and very tasty.",

I added 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and 1 teaspoon of black pepper for a little kick. I did not add the olive oil at the end because that seemed like it wouldn't add much to the flavor. I had never had fennel before and I found that it was a nice change from the monotony of winter-time vegetables. It definitely did not taste like licorice. I would make this again but would probably add cut-up polska kielbasa sausage to it since my family loves the flavor of meat.",

Also I added small 1 cm cubes of goat feta cheese to my bowl since it was my meal. I didn't use a pressure cooker- cooked about 15 minutes until tender.",

Well this soup had no taste of licorice and had a wonderfully smooth flavor.

Thank you again for a great recipe!",
