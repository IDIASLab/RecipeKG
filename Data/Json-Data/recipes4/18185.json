The process was really fascinating, especially the last step where you work the curds into mozzarella.  I did find that for me, it was slightly easier to work the cheese if I raised the temp of the whey to the 190 to 195 degree range.  We also had a lot of fun working different seasonings, like haba\u00f1ero salt, into the cheese just before setting it.  I'm looking forward to making this again.  Thanks for posting it!",
