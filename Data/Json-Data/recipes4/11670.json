Here are the changes you need: After browning your meat add a large red bell pepper (not one strip) and 2 large green bell peppers seeded and cut into STRIPS. Add two large onions (not medium) also cut into strips. Add 4 cloves of garlic and 4 large ribs of celery chopped. Cook until vegetables are tender. Drain the grease and add a tablespoon of dried oregano 1 to 2 tablespoons (not teaspoons) of red pepper flake and salt and pepper along with the rest mentioned in the recipe to the crock pot. The secret ingredient is 4 to 6 ounces of yellow cheddar. Unfortunately one batch of dynamites will never replicate the taste of church bazaar dynamites where all the members of the ladies auxiliary make a batch of their recipe and 20 batches are mixed together in a huge pot and dished out to lucky patrons. Mmmm.",

They go quick and now it is a family favorite.  You can make them as mild or as spicy as you like according to your taste buds.  My grandmom gave me this recipe along time ago and I lost it in a move.  I was craving for some dynamites and so I looked it up knowing I would find the recipe on this website.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  It brings back some fond memories. \r\n",

Some use tomato paste or sauce or crushed tomatoes. Some add chopped celery fresh parsley and/or garlic. This recipe is fine and will give decent results but the rule I've always followed is that for every pound of meat I use two pounds of onions and two pounds of peppers (half green half red is really nice) and I cut the peppers chunky so they will stand out! It's all about preference. Enjoy.",
