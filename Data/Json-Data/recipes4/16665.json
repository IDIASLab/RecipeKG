You really have to love grapefruit which I do because that's mostly what you taste and this drink can be quite sour depending on your grapefruit. You also get a nice subtle ginger flavor in the background. Very refreshing and super healthy. Mine didn't come out as a smoothie consistency - more like a really cold juice. I cut the tops and bottoms off the grapefruits then cut the peels off and proceeded to segment the fruit with a sharp knife so as to not put the membranes in. I just prefer it this way and it cuts some of the bitterness. For those who don't like sour you may want to add a bit of sweetener to your \"smoothie\".",
