It turned out VERY tasty & my whole family of six, plus a baby, polished off an 8 serving meal.  I baked my tofu in soy, garlic, ginger and a bit of honey, instead of frying it because I needed to fry up some ground chicken @ the same time (I only had one box of tofu!).  I never had tofu taste great! Frying it would have gotten the same results.  Satifying and FAST!",

I think that would make them too dry. Once the noodles are getting soft and breaking apart remove them from the heat give them a stir and cover. The steam should finish cooking them. The noodles should soak up the little bit of excess water while you finish cooking your tofu and veggies. In addition to the seasoning I also added a little ground ginger and some basil. I will definitely make this one again!",

I used two ramen packages but only one spice packet because of the high sodium factor but I did add a splash of low-sodium soy sauce. When it was almost finished I threw in some green onions.

I also lightly coat the tofu (I use Japanese style firm tofu) in cornstarch and saute it in peanut oil and sesame oil until lightly crisp and golden.  Then, I baste it with the soy sauce and spices mixture and cook briefly, flipping the tofu twice while basting.",
