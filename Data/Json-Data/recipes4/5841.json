                "reviewBody": "I have made this recipe twice now but modifying the recipe and ingredients somewhat. The 1st time I made this I used about 8 oz. of regular wide noodles (not Kluski noodles though) and using 1-1/2 cups of sauerkraut (but used bavarian sauerkraut as that's what I had on hand) plus I added 1 teaspoon each of garlic powder and onion powder to the flour and other spices. The 2nd time I made this I used 7 oz. of wide noodles along with the 2 cups of sauerkraut plus the teaspoon each of garlic powder and onion powder to the flour and other spices. Fixed both ways was good but while I preferred the less sauerkraut and 8 oz. of noodles my husband prefered this dish with the 2 cups of kraut with the 7 ounces of noodles. Also... I prepared the sauce in a 3 quart saucepan and adding 1 cup of cheese to it then stirred in the cubed sausage and kraut and added it to a greased casserole baking dish plus stirred in the cooked noodles as well. Topped the casserole with a mixture of 4 tablespoons of plain dried bread crumbs mixed with 2 tablespoons of melted butter and baked it in the oven for 25 minutes. This made 6 delicious servings! If you love kraut you'll love this main dish! One more thing... instead of Kielbasa I used ECKRICH Skinless Smoked Sausage (a 14-oz. package). This is a great recipe! I could eat this at least once a month. Also this recipe definitely deserves more than 5 stars as that's how good it is. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!",

I rinsed my sauerkraut b/c I don't care for a strong sour taste so I did need to add a bit of salt to compensate for that. This is serious comfort food and I will def be making it again YUM!
