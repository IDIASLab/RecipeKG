I used a rustic boule of whole wheat bread and replaced the bacon with crumbled sausage meat. I also served it with the Yummy Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce from this site. So good! The flavors are perfect! If you don't have a panini press just heat a skillet on medium and when it's hot put your sandwich down with another smaller pan on top of it to press it down. Then just put a heavy can on it to hold it. Flip the sandwich after 2-3 minutes (after it's toasted nicely).",
