This is a mild curried beef recipe with root vegetables. It's very filling and goes nicely with brown basmati rice. Chinese Five Spice is a mixture of aniseed, cinnamon, fennel, pepper, and cloves.",

First I used 2 pounds stew meat rather than 1/2, and I didn't boil the beef, I dredged it in seasoned and browned it, then set it aside. I omitted parsnips (what are parsnips anyway?) and zucchini. Rather than go through the whole roasting pan ordeal, I dumped the browned beef & 1 can of beef broth into the pot with veggies, added a cup of water put the lid on & simmered for about 1 1/2 hours.   The only change I will make next time would be to add the apples about half way through, because they were a bit soggy after cooking. Other than that, it's DELICIOUS! Wasn't too spicy for my kids either.",

We used extra garlic but still found that the ginger was the strongest flavor. Looking for the 5 spice I found Dukkah blend at Trader Joe's: almonds sesame seeds fennel seeds coriander anise seeds and kosher salt. Used about a tablespoon of that with the curry and turmeric but forgot to add cinnamon and cloves. Overall it was better than I thought it would be.",
