Also the tomatoes were mushy since you cook them until they pop and the taste of the tomatoes didn't seem to go well with other ingredients. Though I liked the taste of the sauce with a hint of star anise. Also I don't understand why this would be served with rice with so many potatoes in recipe. I omitted the rice. I tried recipe because I love star anise but this one will not be used again by me.",
