I did adjust it a bit to suit our tastes but I still used all ingredients called for...I added more butter than called for (3 Tbsps.) only used 2 Tbsps. sriracha sauce added a bit of salt to taste and reduced the dried basil to 1/2 tsp. due to personal preference. This would be a great side to any meat or fish. I served them as a side for buffalo chicken wings and they were a big hit. Next time I wanna use sesame oil in place of the peanut oil to add extra flavor. I could totally see college kids making this lol. I will def be making these again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I didn't have peanut sauce and used toasted sesame seed oil instead; it was just as fantastic I might even prefer it that way. And if you want a quick dinner throw in some pieces of chicken or other meat with the sauce and noodles. I might even just cook chicken in the sauce without the noodles. This is a quick easy and tasty recipe. Highly recommend it!",
