Our store was out of pine nuts so I just used sunflower seeds instead and it tasted great; the nuts gave it more of a 'meaty' texture and the spinach and feta made it so rich. My husband LOVED it. I used the Egg Noodles recipe from this site to make the raviolis - it was really easy and wonderful. If you do that though you only need half of the filling. Next time I'll half it. Thank you so much! I will definitely make these again.",
