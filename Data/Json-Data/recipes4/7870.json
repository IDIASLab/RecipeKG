The dough rolled out so nice, I was able to roll it very thin, next time I would roll even thinner.   I heated the oven and a pizza stone to 450 for 30 minutes while making up the dough.   I placed the rolled out dough on parchment paper, did not pre-bake and topped with sauce, cheese and pepperoni.  Baked for 10 minutes at 450.  \nThis made one pizza, that was inhaled - next time I will double or triple the recipe.  Thanks for this quick and easy recipe.",

I followed the recipe as is, only I added 1/2 tbs (approx) of Italian seasoning to the dough. The dough was pliable and easy to work with. I rolled between 2 sheets of parchment paper, pricked dough and baked for 8 minutes. Then I brushed on olive oil, added toppings and baked 8 minutes more at 400\u00b0. I baked directly on the parchment. Will make again when I\u2019m in a time crunch or when I think I have yeast...and I don\u2019t!",
