The package of empanada wrappers that I bought only had 10 wrappers, so I scaled this down to 10 servings, but used the entire can of hash and 3 eggs, and kept all of the remaining ingredients as scaled. I made these early in the day, and they re-heat well in the microwave (only taking about 15 seconds to re-heat from room temp). Serve them with a side of salsa for a delicious breakfast treat.",
