Instead of then 'smashing' the potatos, I cut a cross in the upper side of each, to about half-way through. Then, by using a finger and thumb on each hand to genyly squeeze in the lower half, (press between each cut line) the potato opens up, like a flower! This allows the seasoning liquid to flavour the inside of the potato more and, (if you don't ever fill them), crisp the skins nicely. Leftover seasoning can be added just before serving, if desired.",

Since I was serving this with another side dish that already had herbs I omitted them here, just brushing the smashed potatoes with olive oil and sprinkling them with sea salt and pepper before baking. I used Baby Yukon Golds, trying to keep them all uniform in size. They're cute little guys, look great on the plate and, if left in the oven long enough, are crispy, beautifully browned and delicious.",

If I made them again, I might whizz the herbs in my mini processor and add maybe a little cayenne or cajun/creole seasoning.  Thanks so much for posting your recipe.",

This recipe was delicious, and thumbs up from hubby and two teenage daughters.  I noticed some people had trouble getting the sauce over all the potatoes.  I drained the potatoes after boiling, left them in the pot for a bit, then poured a bit of sauce over each potato while in the pot, then gave them a  in the pot so they were well coated.  I had pork roast in the oven at 325F, so couldn't use the oven, but fried them instead.  In they went into the pan, and I smashed them there.  I just flipped them a few times, so they cooked evenly.  The herb sauce just melded into the potatoes, made them very tasty.",
