I used Ritz that were roasted vegetable flavor for the bread crumbs, used onion powder instead of onion for the picky ones in my family, added a little dried sage for seasoning, and used chicken broth instead of water. One review said 1c of broth, but 1/2 cup would have been plenty.  I also had thin chops so I put the stuffing on top to start with and just cooked all together in oven for 1/2 hour covered and then 10min or so uncovered to crisp up the stuffing a little.  It was really, really good and the smell was fantastic while it cooked as well.  Overall, I find pork pretty bland, sometimes tough, and my least favorite meat, but this was tender, flavorful, and just darn good!:)",
