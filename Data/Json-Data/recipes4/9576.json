By itself it is tasty but a little plain. Also this recipie makes A LOT as the pasties are very large. One pastie could feed 2 people especially kids. I browned my beef first just to form a slight crust on the beef and I also added about a tablespoon of flour to the beef mixture before baking to thicken up the juices a bit. Next time I'd try addind garlic powder to the beef to see if that makes it a little more flavorful. Thanks for the recipie Kevin!",

                "reviewBody": "NB: A word to the wise - if you are visiting England, and want to experience a really decent Cornish pastie (this recipe barely hints at the gastronomic delights you can encounter there), you MUST get a pastie at Stein's deli, Padstowe (they are a tad spendy but they really are worth it), or Pronto Pastie, almost any place in the West Country. Also, for the most delightful cream teas and scones (scones are like biscuits but they come with clotted cream and strawberry jam) visit any of the tea shops at Boscastle - a pot of tea for 2 plus 2 fist-sized scones and jam and cream will set you back about $6! Boscastle is a truly beautiful, breath-taking fishing village, and you won't be disappointed!) ANYWAY, the pasties in this recipe were alright. I have eaten enough Cornish pasties in Cornwall to know a good one when I see it (or taste a good one when I taste it??), and this wasn't it really. The pastry was ok, though I much prefer a puff-pastry shell. The innards were dry and pretty tasteless, despite the fact I added A LOT of freshly-ground pepper, which is how traditional pasties are supposed to be... I suspect that good Cornish pasties can only be found it Cornwall....",

I make mine with ground chuck, carrots, onions, red potatoes, and rutabega.  I also use the refrigerated Pillsbury pie crust (not the frozen Pet-Ritz kind) which makes them quick and easy to make and they still taste great.  Now living in Texas with my Texas-born husband, he insists I add chili power and cumin to the filling.  So nontraditional, but it's still good!",

The meat was probably too lean so be careful what cut you buy. Next time I will add carrots which most UP MI ones have. Overall I was very pleased with my first attempt. Thanks for the recipe.",
