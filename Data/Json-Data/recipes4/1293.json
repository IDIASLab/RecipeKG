Half the comments about bland and floury probably are eliminated by letting it rest - almost any time you add a fat or liquid to flour you want to let it set. (and baking powder not Soda - PLEASE) MAKER SURE to get the excess batter off let it drain shake it...whatever. Batter is not like flour-egg-flour. It'll be too much if you just batter it and drop it into the fryer. If you want season either season the batter (not the dredging flour) or sprinkle you Paul Prudhomme or what have you IMMEDIATELY after it comes out of the oil and no one will say bland again (that way you can also season separately for kids and adults). I used thighs because chix breats have no flavour and it worked fine. If the chicken isn't cooking wrap it in foil and bake for 5-10 minutes...it'll be just fine. Great and easy recipe for batter fried that can be changed for your taste",

I had high expectations for this and it turned out anything but what I expected. The \"beer\" part of it seemed inviting however it was a LOT of MESSY work and after frying the coating came out very dry and bland. The coating wouldn't cook through for the life of it so it took a really long time. It quickly became a leftover to the next day and at that point when I microwaved it it just became soggy and gross so I had to throw it out... Not really worth the hassle with the mess when I could have made another chicken recipe faster better tasting and generally more worth my time:-(.... Don't think I'll be trying this again.",
