However I did add about a 1/4 c of vital wheat gluten to this so that could've tipped it over into dry territory. I just did the dough in the bread machine and when I took it out it looked to be too much for my loaf pans (I use smaller ones than most people I think) so I broke off about 1/4 and made 7 small rolls to go with dinner. Bf liked these a lot--he said they were good which for a ww recipe that's high praise indeed for him. Nice and soft and a tad chewy. I baked the rolls for 15 mins at 375 and the bread for 40 mins. Thanks for the recipe!",
