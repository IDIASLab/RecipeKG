I cut the shortening down to 3 tablespoons, omitted the salt, and used 1 jar of beef baby food instead of the ground pork. Pork allergies are common in dogs and they also don't have a taste for salt like humans do. Instead of the water and dry milk I used 1/2 cup of 1% milk, since that's all I had on hand. Also, don't bother putting them 2 inches apart on the cookie sheets... I pack mine on there, almost touching. They do not expand during baking, they shrink if anything. My Patterdale Terrier went bonkers for these! :) ",

In an albeit not too scientific experiment my dog chose this biscuit over cooked chicken and store bought dog biscuits. I thought the ground meat was going to be messy but it wasn't at all. I did leave the biscuits in the turned-off oven overnight to dry them up. My dog gained 4lbs in two weeks after I made her these because she wanted them so much that I kept on feeding her. I tried all the other dog biscuit recipes on this website and this is by far the best.",

The question was should they be frozen or refridgerated. I asked the All Recipes Staff and here is their answer: We recommend that you freeze your dog treats if you don't think they will be consumed within a few days. The fat in the beef can get old fairly quickly. If your dog does not like cold treats heat them in the microwave for about 15 seconds. Thanks for your feedback to the Allrecipes.com(r) network. Great Staff great recipe!! BJ",

I usually buy 1/2 lb. of ground beef when it's on sale at the market and fry it up after I've cooked bacon thus eliminating most or all the shortening. I crumble a beef bouillon cube into the hot mixture after it has cooked and mix well. I cut out hearts and call them my California Hearts. Usually I cut out a pan of mini hearts and 3 pans of the regular size. They are wonderful! I do store them in the fridge.
