I could get this whenever I wanted when I lived in NJ, but now that I'm in PA, it's not so easy.  So this is what I came up with as a replacement.  I'm not sure how authentic it is, but it's good!",

I always use a red/yellow/orange pepper because it needs the sweetness to balance out the hotness from the sausage and jalapenos. Plus green peppers make me burp! Also the way this is written you should be able to get 6-8 servings out of this easily. Enjoy!!!",

I made a few changes (no peppers or jalapenos used tomatoes instead and added some italian seasoning skipped the cornstarch part because my sauce was thick enough already) I wasn't a fan of the italian sausage we got so I ate mine without - still fantastic! Beware however - this is not a \"fix it & forget it\" recipe - you're basically working on it right up until it's ready. If you're making it for company I'd make the sauce a little while ahead and let it simmer or pan-cook it to reheat and make the pasta right before serving. Excellent!!!",

It lacked so much flavor I had to totally doctor it up with salt pepper garlic & onion powder along w/paprika. I also had to add a full cup of wine as well. No cornstarch needed since it was thick enough too thick in fact that I had to add almost a whole can of chicken broth. I didn't had the spice since my 5yr old will be eating it so not sure if that had anything to do w/the end result. It made an awful lot so we'll have to make due. Wish I wouldn't have wasted my ingredients or the 2 hrs it took to complete the dish. Won't be making this again.",
