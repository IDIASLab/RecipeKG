I do modify it by:\nuse about 6 slices of jalapenos (the kind sold in small jars) and mince them very fine.  This adds the hot flavor but it's still mild enough for even kids to eat.  I also use only 1/2 cup butter, and I omit the cheddarcheese from the sauce (which may be what keeps mine from having too much sauce and being mushy, which was a problem for other reviewers.)  I sprinkle the top of the corn/sauce mixture w/ bacon bits and plain bread crumbs, and then sprinkle about half a cup cheddar on top.  I just had a friend call me for the recipe for her Christmas dinner, which reminded me that I never reviewed it.  Another tip that works well with this recipe:  buy cream cheese and throw it into the freezer so you always have it on hand for this recipe.  It makes no difference at all in the dish.  I've used frozen cream cheese in other saucy recipes and it works fine, but I don't recommend it for frostings.",
