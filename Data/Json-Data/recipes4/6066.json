We all liked the flavor but it was a little bit too much - a little too sweet and a little too salty. I made it exactly as directed and marinated it only one hour and it was too much. And I used Tamari which is less salty than regular soy. Next time I will halve the soy and honey maybe add some orange juice or even salt water to make enough liquid to simulate the 2/3 C called for in the recipe.",

We do not own a grill so we simply fry the pork in a pan and it comes out beautifully. It's sweet and salty without being overwhelming. Make it with mashed potatoes and gravy and it's always a hit in our household. LOVE this one! (EDIT: I would like to add that we usually make this with some regular pork chops cut into cubes not pork tenderloin and they turn out just as delicious! Also these do not make good leftovers so eat it all while it's fresh.)",
