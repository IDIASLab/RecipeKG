        "description": "Not your average chili. Because this is a chili and not a stew or soup, it is deliberately under-watered. I would add 1 cup of water if you are planning on leaving the house while this cooks, especially on High. And if you are using frozen chicken, allow an extra hour to reach the correct consistency. Also, you may need to add salt depending on how salty the broth you are using is. If you like your chili spicier, I would add a lot more jalapenos. I think I used about 3 tablespoons on a half recipe of this. For a more intense cumin flavor, use cumin seeds instead or add the cumin at the end.",

                "reviewBody": "I was looking for a slow cooker white chili recipe, and I found a great one in this! I doubled it (my bag of beans was 1 lb, so it just worked better). I used two garlic cloves (crushed) instead of garlic powder, and about a tsp of dried cilantro as I didn't have any fresh. I started out with just the jalapeno that's called for, but at my taste-test partway through cooking, it was super bland, so I added two cans (4 oz each) of diced green chiles and a pinch of red pepper flakes (the recipe notes mention additional peppers and I definitely agree!!). Even with those additions, it had just a touch of kick. If my toddlers weren't eating it with us, I'd probably add still more heat. Also per the recipe notes, I put in half of the cumin at the beginning and half at the end, so it wouldn't get lost during the 8-hour slow cooking. The only other slight adjustment I made was to use my immersion blender a little bit while I had the chicken out to shred. That thickened up the chili just enough to my liking. (I also added about 1 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper towards the end, as the chicken stock I used was unsalted.) The end result was delicious, and was enjoyed by me, my husband, and our 1- and 3-year-olds! I'm very happy to have this chili to add to my winter meals rotation.",
