I LOVE that they are baked, not fried, and still come out crispy!\r\n\r\n My only suggestion for others, is to make sure you get SPRING ROLL Wrappers, not the stuff that most grocerystores carry. The real oriental stores carry wrappers that are about 1/8 thinner than those you can get at the grocery. The thinner wrappers makes theese cook up just like a real spring roll. The thicker store bought wrappers, make for a less crisp, chewy srpingroll, although still GREAT!\r\n\r\n You can also bake theese, and then freeze them and have them for a quick snack. I always make about 100 when I make them!\r\n\r\n Oh and I had to add, instead of fussing with turning after 10 minuets. I set my oven to BROIL for hte last 10 min and lower the rack. This cooks them nicely on BOTH sides w/o the worry of turning!",

Instead of pork, I used 1/2 a package of rice vermicelli (125g)like our local Thai and Vietnamese restaurants do.  I also added some soy sauce and salt as I found the mix not seasoned enough.  They turned out great.  I doubled the recipe trying to get 24, but I only got 16, perhaps I put too much filling in, but something to consider.  I dipped them in a sweet and sour sauce....YUM! Make sure to turn them 1/2 way through for even browning.  GREAT RECIPE!",
