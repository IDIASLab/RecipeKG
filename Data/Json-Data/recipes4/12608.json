I make this almost everyday. It has become a staple in my diet. I love it. I eat it crispy with simple guacamole--avacado onion lemon fresh garlic salt and pepper-- and with herbed greek yogurt---salt and pepper and minced greens and fresh garlic on a plate with cooked bitter greens such as turnip or mustard greens. I cannot believe I found this food! I didn't even know I was looking forit. It was at the food shelf and I was curious. Now I don't go a day without it.",
