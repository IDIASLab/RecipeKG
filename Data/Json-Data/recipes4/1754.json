Duck is already a very fatty meat.  The last thing it needs is to have a half cup of butter dumped over it.  Stuff the cavity with some onion, lemon wedges, and garlic cloves, skip the butter entirely, and it's perfect.",

I added a bit of garlic to the rub, I also put half a stick of butter in the duck before putting it in the oven and the last 15 minutes of cooking i glazed it with the orange sauce, and it was just so good. We have duck every year during the holidays and this was the best it has ever turned out. TY for the great recipe!",

My husband and I both stopped mid- first bite and looked at each other with surprise, it was so good. It also looked beautiful, I should have taken a picture but we were hungry! I did not use any butter or oil, and neither should you. Duck is VERY fatty and will produce plenty of oil to baste in during cooking. Also, I elevated the duck on quartered potatoes so that it wouldn't be swimming in fat during cooking. I definitely recommend this as it also covers a tasty side dish. I also stuffed the duck with a quartered onion. This recipe is a keeper and my husband demanded the leftovers for lunch.",

First, I poked many holes in the \"skin only\"  to help release the grease (as recommended by other sites.) I used the ingredients in this recipe plus 1 tsp. garlic and 1 tsp. seasoning salt as others had suggested. I rubbed the seasoning on it the day before and let it sit overnight in the frige.\nWOW! It was the best duck that I have ever eaten! \nI was so impressed and so very pleased. Throw away the orange sauce that comes with the duck, it does no justice! I have tried it before and was never impressed. Before trying this recipe I really wasn't impressed with duck, but now, WOW!\nYou must try it! This will be my only \"go to\" recipe for duck! \nLOVED IT, as did the family! I cooked a 7lb duck. Used the meat thermomiter to reach between 160 and 180. I also put a rack in the roasting pan so it wouldn't sit in the grease. Also, I read to save the grease in the frige, it is great for the best fried potatoes or fried eggs.",
