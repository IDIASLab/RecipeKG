It's okay in taste but I would never serve this to company and to be honest, I doubt I'll make again. Once the veggies were tender, I did drain off some of the water and then added chicken buillion cubes and \"sauted\" them until the cubes dissolved. If you have NOTHING in the cupboard but want some veggies, I guess you could try this recipe. Its not a bad recipe = just nothing special either. Thanks anyways!",

Thankfully, I came across this recipe, and I had everything except the vegetable bouillon, which I substituted with chicken bouillon. Cooking only for one, and trying to use up as much veggies as possible, I grated two small potatoes and  one carrot, and then thinly sliced 1 1/2 green bell pepper and a small white onion, plus added 1 Tbsp minced garlic. Also, I sauteed them with the corn kernels under medium heat with 1 Tbsp of olive oil before I added the water, and the smell was just divine. I then added the water and bouillon cube and then simmered it for about an hour. The flavor of the chicken kind of overpowered the roasted veggies taste, so next time, I'll look for vegetable bouillon or probably just add a little butter before adding the water and no bouillon. But all in all, a pretty good batch of soup. Thanks!",

This (or something very similar) has been a staple in my kitchen for over 15 years when I'm looking for a quick simple throw-together meal that's not too spicy. Not every dish needs to be served with a fire extinguisher! Obviously vegetables can be added or substituted according to what's on hand or in season and seasonings can be added according to your taste which is what cooking is all about. I don't think I've EVER slavishly followed a recipe in over 30 years.",
