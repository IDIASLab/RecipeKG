I like to add chunky pieces of parsnip for a little sweetness, and fresh rosemary gives it a distinct flavour and aroma. If you use a tougher cut of meat, you can leave it to simmer longer before adding the potatoes. Fantastic on a cold, blustery day-served with a pint of the black stuff, of course!",

I would suggest putting them in at the same time as pots. And for the pots I put them in 35 minutes before I like mine to be cooked and soft throughout. I also suggest preparing this meal at least an hour before you need it. Stew always tastes better when left and then warmed up!!! promise.",

I followed the directions pretty close to start but added the parsnips with the potatoes (following other comments). In addition I soaked the lamb in buttermilk overnight to take the \"gamey\" edge off. After beginning the stew on the stove when I added the potatoes and parsnips I put it in the slow cooker for the day (I used the \"keep warm\" setting for the 12 hours I had to be at work). Got home and it was perfect! Fed it to a British native and he raved about it. Great with a spinach salad and crusty bread with a smooth Merlot. We will definately be making this again.",

I made it for St. Patrick's Day dinner this weekend and my family ate every bit--even the parsnips. Of course I didn't tell them about the parsnips until later. Now they know they like 'em! Just a couple of notes: next time I'll cook a big chunk of parsnip and carrot with the lamb but I'll add fresh parsnip and carrot later on so they won't disintegrate. Also I sear the meat in batches and skim the stew as it simmers. Thanks for a great recipe Ita!",
