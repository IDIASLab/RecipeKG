This is a great quick weeknight meal helps to use up items in the pantry and can be made all in one pot... these are all pluses in our house!:) The changes I've made are as follows: Both times I've used a jarred mixture of tomatoes onions & bell peppers that I had canned I've used taco seasoning packets to replace the adobo a can of black beans (rinsed and drained) a tsp of sugar to help enhance the flavors a few squirts of lemon or lime juice and a few sprinkles of cilantro (we're big cilantro fans). Other than that I cook it exactly as stated and just let it simmer on the stove until the rice is tender making sure to add water if needed. Once the rice is just about done I turn off the stove and sprinkle a blend of shredded cheese over the top and just let it melt as the rice mixture thickens up and cools. This is a nice hearty meal and a good way to use up some leftover sausage and other ingredients.",
