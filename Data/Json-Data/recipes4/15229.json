I only had red wine vinegar so I went w/ that. This was wonderful both at room temp and cold. Loved the creaminess of the dressing. Make sure you season it w/ salt and pepper (especially salt b/c it needs it IMO). I also added a some garlic powder. This was a hit tonight and I will def be making it again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I doubled it with no problem the tip about putting the potatoes on a kitchen towel really worked and completely removed the moisture from them. The dressing is easy to make and tastes fabulous. To be fair I did not add the olive oil and it was still very good. My family loved how fresh it tasted not heavy. I quartered some hard boiled eggs and decorated the top with them. Big hit in this household! Thank you for posting this recipe we loved it.",

Every reviewer should have the opportunity to write a fair unbiased review and likewise cooks should use their best judgment and understand that not every recipe will be a winner for everyone. So here's my second attempt at writing an honest review. I thought this was just OK. My in-laws and (potato salad hating) hubby liked this so maybe it's just me??? I guess I prefer a slightly sweet potato salad or at least a less tangy one. The mustard vinaigrette was just a little overkill for me - and ditto for the blue cheese (and I LOVE the stuff!).
