The only issue I had was the millet never got soft, but always have that crunchy edge to it. I added the cinnamon directly into the mixture before baking. It took a lot longer than 90 minutes for me. I used a Jonagold apple that I shredded with a spiral vegetable cutter and followed the recipe exactly. I ended up mixing the leftover with some warm milk making a breakfast cereal out of it the next day. Thank you for the recipe.",
