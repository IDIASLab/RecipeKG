Only thing is that I made them up at home and stuck them in the cooler so they were ready to pop in the coals after a long day fishing and used multiple sheets of foil for each one so they didnt leak. Made up a batch of campfire biscuits and the oohs and ahhs kept coming. Thanks for the great recipe Peter!",

And there was quite a bit of excess liquid possibly from the mushrooms. And I didn't feel the need to add the tablespoon of water. I was suprised based on the onions garlic and variety of spices I used how flavorless it tasted. Also the meat was cooked perfectly but the potatoes and carrots could've used more time - about 10-15 minutes. I'm curious if anyone else ran into the same problem(s).",
