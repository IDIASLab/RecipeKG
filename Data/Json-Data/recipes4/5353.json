I also added 1 cup of green beens, upped the curry powder (we like spice) and used lower fat mushroom soup and no-fat ham.  It lowers the calories, fat and cholesterol count considerably without compromising taste.  I also found one teaspoon of oil sufficient for frying the veggies.  A great way to use leftover wild and white rice.  Enjoy!",

Took one reviewer's idea and made with white sauce (with cayenne and nutmeg) instead of the soup.  I'm not a fan of mushrooms and I didn't see any lack in flavor.  I thought this had a ton of it!  Wild rice alone adds a lot.  Wouldn't change anything other than what I've noted.  Have added to my recipe box and will make anytime I have leftover ham.  Thanks ALN!!",

The flavor combination was very good and we liked having lots of vegetables. We were worried that the soy sauce would make it too salty but no problem there!
