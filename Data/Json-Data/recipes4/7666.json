Ours wasn't too sweet at all, the only problem I had was my starch slurry didn't set in time to serve and I ended up using package pork gravy thinned and mixed with some of the \"bits\" from the crockpot. I served with mashed potatoes and brussels gratin. Yum, this is definitely a keeper!",

Thank you, Helen Dubo!  \n\nI will make it again but with a few adjustments. They are:  browning the roast first after seasoning with salt & pepper, doubling the onion, garlic and thyme, eliminating the rosemary entirely and reducing the broth by at least a third. Also, rather than using a corn starch slurry to thicken the gravy, I will use a blend of soft butter & flour and add to juices after roast has been removed for carving. Will need to cook the gravy a bit longer on high to thicken and to eliminate any raw flour taste. This can also be done in a separate saucepan if desired.",

I work night shift so I set it up (which was supper easy) throwing all the ingredients in the slow cooker and turned it on low the morning before the potluck. By the time we came back that evening it had cooked 11 hours. By the time we actually were able to eat it it had cooked 14 hours. Some of the outer edges were a little tough (over cooked I guess) but the inner part was still very moist and lovely. Despite the apple butter rosemary and thyme it wasn't as fragrant as I would have expected. I'm thinking about adding extra cinnamon (in addition to the cinnamon that is already in the Apple butter) next time. But the dish was very well received by my coworkers and it was all gone by the time I went to clean my slow cooker in the morning.",
