I admit I made it my own by adding some items ham base to the cabbage garlic powder and Italian seasonings and red pepper. I also added carrots and grape tomatoes as they were in the fridge. THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL BASE RECIPE! I also used just regular egg noodles. I only used 1 cabage and 1 1/2 pounds of kielbasa. I am so happy about this recipe and it will definitely be a new staple in our dinner rotation!!Oh man!! I forgot the eggs! I will definitely do those next week! Yay cabbage!",

I substituted some ground beef (a little under a pound) and a few strips of bacon. I also made it the easy way - in an instant pot. I started on saute mode, cooking the beef and bacon. I removed it, chopping the bacon when cool, and then cooked the onion in the remaining drippings (no oil) in the instant pot, still on saute. Then I added the cabbage and mustard seed and cooked in saute mode until the cabbage was wilted. Then I added 2 cups of chicken stock and 16 ounces of egg noodles. I stirred well and sealed the instant pot. I cooked at pressure for 9 minutes, followed by a quick pressure release. I then added the eggs and about a cup of frozen peas that I had thawed. Then I let it all sit for a few minutes to set up the eggs and cook the peas. Finally, I added a heaping tablespoon of sweet Bavarian mustard and salt and pepper to taste. My son preferred the latter version, and he is the picky one in the family. It's a great recipe that you can adjust to accommodate what you have on hand!",
