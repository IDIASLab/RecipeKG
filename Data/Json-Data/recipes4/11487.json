I added an extra Tbs of garlic and ginger (but I LOVE both). And use the real stuff! Powder doesn't have as much flavor. I sprinkled the tofu with s&p and cornstarch and fried it in another pan. I separated the bok choy and cooked the thick stalk part before I added the leafy part so the leaves wouldn't get soggy. The most important thing is to make sure that the veggies aren't overcooked otherwise it'll be soggy and all the flavors will mush together. Last of all, make sure that the sauce is very thick!! It will be bland and runny if you mix it together too early. I think next time I'll try using sesame oil too.",

I made it with the array of veggies I had in the fridge--some broccoli zucchini red and yellow pepper and baby carrot--and fried the onion garlic ginger and tofu in a mix of regular vegetable oil and toasted sesame oil. I used half the tofu called for and made more of the sauce. The sauce really was key and its flavor can be adjusted easily. I did not find the meal to be bland and I didn't need extra salt. As I do for many Asian food recipes I topped it off with nuts sliced almonds this time. Thanks for the recipe particularly the sauce!",

To fry the veggies and tofu I use vegetable oil with a sprinkle a combo of sesame seed oil.  I like to use extra firm tofu, and before I put it in the pan, I pat it dry with paper towels, then coat with cornstarch to get a subtle crunch.  The sauce is the best part.  Sooo easy, and yummy!  I sometimes sprinkle ginger powder and red pepper flakes in while it's simmering for extra flavor.",

Don't be gentle with it when cutting as that's when it tends to crumble. Stir-fry is all about the sauce. I found this sauce to be sweet and somewhat tangy. I didn't follow the recipe to the T-spoon but it was still good. I don't know if I could crave this stir-fry though because I'm not a huge fan of sweet entrees. There are a lot of vegetables so I had to double the sauce called for and it turned out perfect. Nothing wrong with extra sauce.",

I also baked the tofu for a few minutes before adding to the pan per another reviewers suggestion but next time I will bake it longer. Tofu is just so hard to cook.
