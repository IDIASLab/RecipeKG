You have to like all of those flavors, though, or you'll end up with a dish you don't like.  And, it just wouldn't be the same without all of the flavors.  I will admit I didn't use the anchovies--I never have them; in fact, I've never bought them in my life and only tried them once.  I don't have any dislike of anchovies; just don't have them.  I used green olives with pimento since that is what I had, and didn't chop the capers. Yum!  My only comments are that you could put in the tomatoes undrained--you'd just have to cook longer--and you don't need that much oil.  I used just enough to coat the pan.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I love seafood so one last thing, after I added noodles and I was cooking the whole dish together, I put a small fillet of salmon over the top of the entire dish, just have something to munch on later, and wow did that add some great flavors to that fillet. I didn't eat the salmon with the pasta.",

They just add a savory nuance that perks up the rest of the flavors in the dish. And that's the beauty of puttanesca! Because the sauce is so easy and comes together so fast it's no trouble to set a portion aside before adding an ingredient that give some eaters trouble. I served it with whole wheat spaghetti and crushed red pepper on the side for those who like more heat. Keep the salad simple - sliced cucumbers are nice - and you can have dinner on the table within 20 min of walking through the door.",

Great recipe if you're vegan (I'm not)...but is a great sauce for whatever pasta you desire (I did use lobster ravioli).
