The rice ( I used Basmati ) had a wonderful flavour but was perhaps just ten minutes overcooked. I'd suggest 1/3 cup less water and 10 minutes less cooking. The chops were delicate and juicy but not all that flavourful so next time I'll brine before searing and ramp up the soup mix with a caramelized onion/beef broth reduction. A little extra salt wouldn't hurt either.",
