I'm not sure what gives it that smell- the yogurt? I've tried this a few different times- once like the recipe says and later with different variations to try to get rid of the smell. Once I decreased the milk to 1/4 cup added 1/2 cup of pumpkin puree and double the cinnamon for more taste also I've tried using vanilla soymilk in place of the milk. Neither seemed to help. I do LOVE how the consistancy of the bread turns out so I will continue to play with this recipe and find something that works- maybe change out the yogurt for applesauce? not sure. Definately is better with added something like pumpkin zucchini carrots raisins etc.",
