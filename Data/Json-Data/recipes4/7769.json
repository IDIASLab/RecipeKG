I also used chicken that I tore off a rotisserie chicken to make it even easier. Garnished w/ lettuce and avocado slices (and crushed Doritos for the hubs), the only thing that I felt like it needed was more than 1/4 c. cheese, and probably no need for the tomato paste (I think I'd use a can of Rotel next time around, along w/ some frozen corn for even more color.)",

I then started making the quinoa in the chicken broth. While waiting on the quinoa I mixed together 1 can of pinto beans drained 1 can rotel drained 1 cup of salsa and took a couple of teaspoons of the seasoning mix and mixed in. Then I pulled the chicken out and shredded the chicken & added it into the skillet mix. Once the skillet mix warmed up I tasted it and added a little bit more seasoning. I would recommend slowly adding the seasoning in because I ended up only using half of the seasoning mix. It would have been way too salty if I put all in. Then I added the quinoa and mixed it in and brought it to a simmer (if it seems a little dry just add a bit more salsa) and for the finale I put shredded cheese on top & let it melt by putting a lid on the skillet. I served it on top of shredded lettuce and a dallop of sour cream. It was delicious! It tasted like an Indian taco.",

Instead of salsa I used 1 can diced(undrained) tomatoes and 1 can(undrained) diced green chiles. I added 1/4 cup diced black olives.I also added 1 tsp taco seasoning in addition to listed seasonings. I simmered everything for about 20 minutes and topped with 1/2 cup shredded cheese and cilantro then served over saut\u00e9ed spinach. This recipe is good in that there are many variations that can be added.My 2 year old daughter ate it up! It was delicious and I'll be making this dish again.",

I used more cumin and salsa than the recipe called for. Rather than chili powder I used the same measure of taco seasoning and just for more southwestern kick I added the juice of half a lime. I also used granulated garlic rather than garlic salt. My biggest issue was the quinoa. While I realize it's healthy it's also very pricey.
