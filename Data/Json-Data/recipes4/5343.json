I omitted the onion salt and added 1/2 of a small white onion, finely diced.  Instead of bacon bits, I fried 3 slices of bacon and crumbled it into the potato mixture.   Initially I made 3 large pancakes then for the next batch I did much smaller ones, about a Tablespoon full each.  We really liked the crispy edges.  These are a little peppery, which we like but if I were making these for company I would cut the pepper to 1/2 tsp.  Thanks for a great breakfast treat!",

All in all, well worth making again. Like another reviewer suggested, I think I'll add minced onion next time. Great side dish with ham and succotash! Thanks for the good recipe.",

I do work out 3-4 times a week and this isn't a regular thing for me so, I swear I'm healthier than this post will lead you to believe.  \n\nAnyways, this was more like a paste going into the pan as opposed to pancake batter.  Subsequently, it became clear about 10 minutes in that it would have to come out of the pan as a paste as well.  That's okay, impromptu chef-as-creative-genius, voila.  \n\nThere really isn't much that holds this together so, all in all, this is more of a breakfast paste than you spoon feed yourself rather than pancakes.
