I used frozen and thawed turkey left over from Christmas so the turkey didn't exactly stay in perfect cubes. I added garlic to the onions and used more sweet potatoes than in the recipe. I found that after adding the turkey sauce to the vegetables it all thickened in less than 5 minutes. It did take a long time to cool though. I had 2 frozen pies shells in foil pans which I had made before Christmas and these worked perfectly for this recipe.",
