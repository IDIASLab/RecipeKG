Pine Nuts are good to have in your freezer, a bag goes a long way unless you're making pesto. Toast them, roast them...or use them raw, they are a nice texture and taste component. Sesame oil is even more critical for its specific taste...toasted Seasame would work too. It's so flavorful. Keep in mind it has a low smoke point, so don't over heat it. Not to mention using reduced fat PB and low salt Soy Sauce. A touch of Sriracha is another option. I would want more protein than listed, so I upped that a bit. Thighs would be good too. Also, I like a lot more PB than listed...even if I need to increase the other sauce ingredients.",

I use one dried cayenne pepper (that we dried ourselves from our garden) instead of jalapeno because I just prefer the taste of cayenne to jalapeno. I also use a ton more peanut butter: I would say I use about a cup but the cayenne makes up for the increase in sweetness. I also always use sesame oil - there's something about the depth that sesame oil adds. I have made this both with pine nuts and without. It's definitely better with the nuts but it's still awesome without. Go easy on the soya sauce because it can overtake the other flavours easily. And finally I love to serve this over a huge bed of spinach.",
