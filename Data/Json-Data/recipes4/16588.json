Although I like spice I knew this would be way too much for me so I only used 1/2 cup green chiles and 2oz of hot sauce - everything else I did as the recipe directed. The pork was very tender but I found that it had A LOT of heat (still) and surprisingly at the same time had no flavour. Sorry but this was just not a winner for me.",
