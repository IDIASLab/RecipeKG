More interesting flavor than plain eggs.  \nNow that I've made it several times, I will share some tweaks that work well.  I sprinkle an 8 oz package of diced ham on top of the sausage on the bottom.  2 green onions chopped go on next, and some partially cooked green and red peppers if on hand.  Next the potatoes.  I always use Tater Tots in an egg casserole, vs the frozen shredded hash browns. They're sturdier.  I use more than 16 oz, maybe 20?  Enough to cover the meats in a single layer.  Next the shredded cheese.  I use more than 2 cups, closer to 3.  For the eggs, I use the peppered gravy mix, and I use 8 eggs with 1 cup of milk.  That's it.  Bake it at 325, 70 minutes.  Let it stand 15 minutes, and then you can slice it into pieces.  \nThis is a delicious recipe!  Thank you for sharing.\n**Also, it's so easy to make ahead.   Follow steps for meat, potatoes, cheese.  Cover and refrigerate.  Then take it out a half hour before cooking it, to bring it more to room temp.  Follow directions for mixing up eggs, etc, pour them on, and bake as directed.   Easy and delicious.",

I used chives instead of green onions as my garden is bursting with them right now and it added a nice subtlety.  I was using the oven in my trailer so not as reliable as my kitchen, but I think it was around the right temp!  I added 1.5 cups of the cheese when the recipe states and then covered with foil for the first 45 min.  For the final 15 min of bake time, I removed the foil and topped with the remaining 1/2 C of cheese.  Thank goodness other reviewers said to use a 9x13 pan.  The 11x7 never would have contained it all!  I will most definitely make this one again.  YUM!!",
