I have been a vegetarian since 1998 and have gotten lax over the years about the ingredient \"natural flavors\" which is found in the Cream of Mush. Soup. Honestly it can be many things and often times not a meat product other than that the soup is completely veg. friendly. Also I diced about a half cup of fresh shrooms (I don't care for canned) and a whole small onion. I used less salt and subtituted a salt-free all purpose seasoning. I used one package of Morning Star veggie crumbles which is technically TVP with more flavor. I used low sodium/low fat soup. Delicious!!!",

I am vegan and went a step beyond that as well but that has nothing to do with the rating. The cream of mushroom soup is a no go for vegetarian so I had to make homemade soup first. At that point there is so much in this recipe that was not called out that it was no longer THIS recipe. It was a good start though and what I came up with as a result is a keeper. Thank you!",
