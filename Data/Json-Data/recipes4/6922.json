Only made for one reason: had that chili sauce.\" So doing an ingredient search on AR for anything including Heinz Chili Sauce yielded this recipe that conveniently had other items that I typically have around but why did I not actually think about that combination of ingredients before starting to put this together? I browned the sausage w/ the onions (prefer smoked sausage a little more \"done\") and wouldn't have wanted raw onion bites floating around a casserole but followed everything else although nothing seemed to improve what turned out to be the most peculiar unappetizing casserole I think I've ever prepared. We picked at our plates and tossed the leftovers. Sorry for the less-than-thrilled review but my husband was in a fit of giggles when I served this it was just THAT weird.",
