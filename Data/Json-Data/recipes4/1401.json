I used whole cloves of garlic and a lot more pepper than 1 tsp I also rubbed the pepper into the meat instead of just sprinkling it on. I also seared the meat on all sides (use a pan that can go from stove top to oven). I put large pieces of carrots, potatoes, onions around the roast when I lowered the tempature. They were so good and the drippings made a really tasty gravy! Thanks!",

However, I tried to salvage it by turning it into french dip.  I sliced it thinly and simmered it in swanson's beef broth with onion on low for about two hours.  It definitely made the best french dip ever!  So five stars for this recipe, even though I had to tweak it.",
