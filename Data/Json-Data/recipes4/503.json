Like others have said play around with the spices -- I double all of them so the flavor stands out in salads etc. After all ingredients are combined I put them in a 325 oven for about 10-15 minutes. This helps the flavor to set and dry off some of the oil. When removed from the oven place them on brown paper or parchment paper to let the remaining oil absorb. Store in an airtight container to keep them fresh. This is a favorite snack at my house whether alone or in a salad. They are quick to make and fun to share.",
