After cooking all day in the crockpot I put it on the stovetop and added: onion slices garlic salt and pepper a couple of shakes of lemon pepper. This added a lot more flavor. The can of potato soup was completely lost as there is a lot of liquid in this dish. I think if I were to make this again I will just add fresh diced potatoes to the recipe. I served this with 'Spiced Applesauce Bread' from AR and fresh San Francisco Sourdough Bread.",

I pretty much did the same thing as I am on a budget and will only make meals with what I have on hand in the house already. Changes I made: Used 3 chicken breasts and cut them into bit size pieces Added chicken breast to crock pot and sprinkled with salt pepper garlic powder onion powder and Lawry's season salt. Used 32 oz of chicken broth and added a can of cream of potato soup to that stirred it up and let that boil until chicken was done. Roughly 1.5 hours. Chopped up one very small head of cabbage 3 carrots and 3 stalks of celery. Added these along with 2 cups of water to the crock. Also added a packet of Swanson liquid chicken seasoning as I tasted the broth and it was very bland. You could use more chicken broth instead I just happened to have a packet of this left so I tossed it in. I also added a teaspoon of minced garlic. I let these cook on high until veggies were done about 3.5 hours. I had a bowl soon after this and wished I had added some extra potatoes to this. Not to worry I cut up some potatoes and boiled them on the stove and added them for my leftover meals. This made it less soupy so if you would rather have more broth don't add more potatoes. For me adding the potatoes made this perfectly yummy. Thanks Bizzle for the great recipe!",

I was very happy I read the reviews bc it must just be an oversight that salt and spices weren't included. So I added a large chicken bouillon cube to the stock and salted the chicken. Then I added about 1/4 of a large sweet yellow onion and 4 small yellow potatoes and galic powder to the veggie step. I removed the cabbage bc my crew doesn't like it. Turned out amazing. Certainly a wonderful base recipe and very versatile! I will certainly make it again.",
