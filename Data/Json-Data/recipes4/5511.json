I did not have tomatoes with green chili peppers (aka RoTel), I used one can of diced tomatoes and one half can of diced mild green chilies. I also used reduced fat sour cream. I did add a little fresh ground pepper. My kids and husband were skeptical that they would like this but I'll tell you--they absolutely loved it. What the kids didn't eat, my husband inhaled. EXCELLENT way to use up pantry items everyone has to make a filling and cost-effective lunch. Next time, I'll take Keri's suggestion and throw in some leftover taco meat or maybe use homemade taco seasoning in place of the seperate seasonings. Thanks for the winner--this one's going in the wooden recipe box.",
