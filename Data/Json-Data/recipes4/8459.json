They don't like healthy food that much and they requested I make more! It has no sugar but they have a real sweet flavor to them.

It was on the spongy side, and more cake like than brownie.  I baked it for 15 minutes exactly in a glass pie plate.  Next time I make it, I will add half of a mashed banana to moisten it up and/or bake a couple of minutes less. 8 servings resulted in 99 calories per serving, 2 carbs, 5 fat grams and 11 protein grams, per My Fitness Pal. Not an outstanding brownie, but a good treat for the macros. It would be extra tasty under some Halo Top ice cream!",
