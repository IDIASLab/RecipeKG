I did add 2T of Tastefully Simple garlic bread seasoning but even if you don't have that I'd recommend adding some seasonings of your choice (oregano, garlic, etc).  I also mixed the sauce in with the ricotta mix instead of layering it.  I found that it only needed to cook for 35 minutes and I took the foil off about 10 before the timer was set to go off so it got a little brown on top.  Yummy!",

I found that the layers didn't really melt or come together during baking like I hoped they would. It's something I'll try again but I'll have to think about adding something to thing out the ricotta mixture because it couldn't really be spread so I ended up with drops that stayed that way when it baked. I will try this again but maybe add a little cream or something to give it a creamier consistency. Thanks for the post.",

I just mix together all the ingredients, except the final 1/4c cheese for the top, and pour it into the baking pan.  Delicious!\n\nEver since I've made the following tweaks:  mix all the ingredients (except the topping cheese) including the uncooked pasta and add about half again more sauce, 1/2c each ff half and half and water.   The pasta cooks in the oven, is never over done,  and the sauce thickens up nicely.  Sometimes I add browned hamburger seasoned with garlic, S&P. \n\nThanks for posting the recipe!",
