Since I didn't have the tomato bouillon, garlic powder, and onion powder I substituted with salt, tomato paste, and adobo.  I kept tasting with a teaspoon to see if the seasoning was fairing well. Came out Good.  Best thing about this recipe is that it gave you the CORRECT instructions on timing the absorption rate. Most times you either under cook or over cook the rice, this one was perfect. Best tip I can give with rice is use a clear top pan. Lets you see what's going on inside.",
