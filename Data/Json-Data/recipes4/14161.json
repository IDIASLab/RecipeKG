Here are the nitty gritty details for those who like them: ---I halved the recipe and put it in a 7 x 11 glass dish (2\" deep). It worked out so it baked right up to the top but wasn't overflowing. There was plenty of room for the noodles to expand but they didn't get all crinkled up and end up on top of each other. ---The noodles and sauce were the perfect ratio so it cooked into a thicker lasagna and not like soup nor paste. ---I only let the lasagna sit 5 hours before I needed to bake it. ---I added one beaten egg into the cottage cheese to help it set up better. ---The number of servings seems pretty low on the original recipe. My half-recipe ended up making 6 very generous servings. ---Thank you again! I will use this recipe from now on.",

Only things I did different was used 16 oz. of cheese, added an egg to the cottage cheese, and added some dried basil and a little minced garlic while cooking the meat.  I'm sure the sauce plays a huge roll in the flavor.  I used Hunts Meat Sauce.  It was perfect AND is only $1 a can!  I used a 8x11 pan so everything was snug and stayed together.  Just a note: in the past I've used low-fat cottage cheese and it turns watery.  This time I used the full-fat small curd and the flavor and texture were perfect.  I also used no-boil lasagna, but I always soak them in hot water for about 40 minutes before using them.  Just a little tip I've heard along the way and it really does ensure they cook through.\nNOTE: The Oven-Ready lasagna noodles at Walmart are under $1.50!",
