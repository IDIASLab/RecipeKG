Save time by using boneless pork chops and cubing them after they are browned. There should be enough salt in the canned tomatoes to season the stew, but if not, add more to your taste. Use best-quality, real Hungarian paprika for best results. We prefer to serve it with noodles, but galuska (Hungarian dumplings) or rice are good, too.",

(Except for family favorites I rarely prepare the same dish twice)  This is just excellent; a flavorful and satisfying comfort food that doesn\u2019t bog down in an overload of spices or any processed ingredients.  I started off with boneless country-style ribs that I cut into small pieces before browning them in bacon grease.  I cooked the onion separately, a good long while before continuing on with the recipe, and used fresh garlic rather than garlic powder.  Given that I scaled this down to three servings (one pound of meat) for Hubs and me, it wasn\u2019t practical for me to open up a can of beef broth for the small amount called for.  Red wine filled in nicely (I happened to have a glass handy :)  I used twice the amount of tomatoes called for (a full can for the 3-serving recipe I made) and in my view it was just right.  Rather than stirring the sour cream into the mix I gave each plate a dollop of it upon serving and when I make this again I\u2019ll do it the same way.   I served this over buttered wide noodles and garnished it with chives.  I\u2019m not sure just what made this so darn good, the bacon maybe or the sweet Hungarian paprika, but this humble dish was a real sleeper hit tonight.",

                "reviewBody": "Almost like mom's. I made a few changes to what I remember being in the dish as a child. I halved the recipe. Skipped the bacon and opted to use canola oil instead of the bacon grease. Sauteed onion a few cloves of minced garlic handful each of frozen diced green and red bell pepper. Added the diced pork (used a 1/4-1/2 pork loin roast relatively lean) then tossed in the seasonings including a beef bouillon cube for the beef broth. I also squeezed in a generous teaspoon or two of sweet red (bell?) pepper paste. Let it cook down until pork was nearly fully cooked. Added the can of diced tomatoes and water mixed with enough browned flour to thicken (this is the liquid part used combined with the beef bouillon cube to replace the beef broth). I let this practically come to a rolling boil and 'simmered' for about 30 minutes then added half a small container of sour cream and 2-3 generous shakes of Parmesan. Lowered the heat to a light simmer just enough to meld the cheese and sour cream into the sauce. Served over linguine (not traditional but that's all we had) and had the shaker on the side if anyone wanted extra cheese (you could say the addition of the Parmesan is an American touch/take on the dish). I'm half Hungarian and this is comfort food at its best (for me at least!). As a side note there are two types of Hungarian paprika- The 'hot' being spicy and 'edes' being mild (not spicy). It is still different from regular grocery paprika.",

I usually serve it over some sort of rice (white/jasmin/basmati) instead of the egg noodles but that's just personal choice  ;))  my bf loves pulled pork sandwiches, so when I buy a pork rib roast, I cook up the meat in my slow cooker.. I save half of the meat (about 3 or 4 Lbs), and shred it, and put it in a ziploc freezer bag in my freezer.. when I get the craving for this recipe, I just pull out the meat from the freezer and use that... I add it to the pot after I saute the bacon, onions, paprika... another thing I have done is with the left overs from this recipe the next evening, it is GREAT rolled up in a flour tortilla and baked in the oven with some extra sauce + cheese, as a enchilada! (I have added some black beans into the porkolt mixture and/or some kibblet corn, with the rice mixed in - not the noodles) is a really good way to put a spin on the leftovers... thanks for the great recipe!",

Used 3/4 of large onion.\n1/2 Green Pepper, 3/4 Red Pepper.\n2/3 cup of broth was great for this quantity.\nAs for the pork I used 2 lbs. of pork butt; gristle & fat removed, and cut into 1 inch pieces, and I didn't change the seasoning.\nI took the cook time to 3 hours to insure that the butt was tender and cooked through.\nThis was a excellent recipe that I had to gear towards my family and costs.\nI made the Hungarian dumplings and let them cook in the sauce for the last 45 minutes.\nDefinitely a \"keeper\" recipe and will do this one again.

                "reviewBody": "Porkolt = \"roasted\". Since I love my slow cooker AND I'm trying to eat healthier I decided to skip the stove method and add my own personal touches. I omitted the bacon and bell pepper altogether (bacon for fat/cal content; bell pepper because my family detests) used fire roasted diced tomatoes and 2 large cloves of fresh minced garlic dumped all ingredients into my 6qt. Crock Pot used diced pork stew meat stirred and let it ride for 4 hrs on LOW. I uncovered for 30 min. to let the sauce thicken. I tried it without sour cream and then with. It's absolutely delicious both ways but if you're trying to trim as much fat/cals as you can while still having a succulent meal I'd say skip the sour cream - you really won't miss it. Prepare to have your home filled with a mouthwatering aroma while it stews in its own juices. We served it on quinoa as it's what I had in my pantry (not to mention the boost in nutrition). This is can stand alone however; you do not need a starch/filler. The only thing it seemed to lack for me was spice which is why I didn't give it a full 5 stars. I used authentic Hungarian Paprika and it gave a savory punch but I like a little kick so next time I'll add a dash or two of chili powder. So easy! Can be frozen. Serve with crusty bread and a big bowl of fruits/veggies. Tastes even BETTER the next day. Highly recommend - this is comfort food at its best! =)",

Not even my kids who only eat non-spicy food though it was a keeper. Since there were several meals worth of leftovers and I hate to waste food I added cayenne pepper to it and it was thereafter passable. The cayenne pepper raised it to a 3 star recipe. I would NOT make this again.",
