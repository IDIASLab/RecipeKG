And the crazy part is, it's SO amazingly easy with only a few ingredients. Very impressive flavor. I haven't made a recipe this good with so few ingredients in quite a while. The only thing I might suggest is using less chicken bouillon because I found it slightly salty.  I didn't have bouillon cubes, so I used the equivalent of 7 cubes in Better Than Bouillon chicken base (7 teaspoons), which may be the culprit, although from what I've heard, the cubes are more salty anyway. Next time I will try 5. And there will definitely be a next time. Oh, and one more thing....this makes a lot of soup, like 4 gigantic servings or 6 \"normal\" size servings. Thanks for the amazing recipe Jilly Bean!",
