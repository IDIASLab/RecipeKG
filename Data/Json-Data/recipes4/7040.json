Used 9 X 13 pan rather than pie pan so cooked about 35 min. instead of 25. After it set put mixed shredded cheese & cheddar then added 1 sliced tomato (since I had already put some in mixture) and parsley flakes for color.It was good but really too dense...won't put as much stuff in again. Had a little batter left so baked it with sliced banana (one I had that was starting to turn brown cinnamon and a touch of honey...served with a bit of whipped cream....it was good dessert.",
