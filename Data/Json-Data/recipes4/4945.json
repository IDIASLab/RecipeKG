My thought was if I seared the pork chops directly on the grill first before placing the other ingredients on top they d take on a nice grilled exterior and a smokier flavor. After searing the chops I transferred them to a foil tray. I layered on the tomatoes basil garlic and mozzarella and then put the pan back on the grill. However by doing this the flavors didn t get a chance to marry. This likely wouldn t have been the case had I followed the directions as written. As a result my version was a disappointing two stars whereas had I followed directions it would likely have been rated the four stars I originally expected it to be.",

I did not explain to our guests what the dish was named other than it was a pork chop. It took less than 3 minutes for someone to say \"This is delicious - it tastes just like pizza.

Followed the recipe only adding a little Grill Mates seasoning along with the salt and pepper. Hubby threw the chops on a screaming hot grill for just a minute to sear them before putting them in the pan and proceeding with the recipe. We love that you can taste each of fresh flavors from the tomatoes basil oregano and mozarella. Taste like Pizza....but also tastes like summer! This will be be a staple during grilling season.

I also increased the garlic a bit and I also seared the pork chops in a hot skillet before proceeding with the rest of the ingredients. I think these would be even better with a homemade marinara sauce to maybe make them more \"pizza\" like. This would make a good hot sandwich filling too like on ciabatta bread or a good french bread. As is we liked these. I served them with herbed pasta and a tossed green salad. I'll make this again.",
