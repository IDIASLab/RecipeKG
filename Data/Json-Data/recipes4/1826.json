Take the frozen hashbrown patties and make them according to package, fry up an egg per each hash brown.

Also I don't boil potatoes for this whenever I make baked potatoes I usually throw extra ones in. They keep well in the fridge and you can slice them for fried potatoes peel & dice them for a quick potato hash or even potato salad or you can grate them for hash browns. Left-over baked potatoes are a great thing to keep on hand for a quick easy meal anytime of the day. There's lots more things you can do with them than I've already mentioned.",
