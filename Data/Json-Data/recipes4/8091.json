I did a couple of changes to make it to my taste, one being quadrupled the recipe essentially to make enough to last for more than one day. (ha) I did add a dash of sea salt, and an egg yolk while stirring all other ingredients,  and in the end stirred in some coconut oil, about a tablespoon, and used about 2 teaspoons of pure bourbon vanilla.  Topped it with some sliced almonds and sprinkle of unsweetened shredded coconut.  This was SO rich and dark it was sensual and extremely satisfying.",

It isn't quite as sweet as regular sugar and either is this pudding. The pudding sort of reminds me of a dark chocolate version of chocolate pudding in flavor. What I really liked is how nicely it thickened up. I cooked it on medium stirring as it thickened with a whisk. Although it made it non-dairy I topped the cooled down pudding with whipped cream. That added just enough sweetness. Also upon reading the first review I tripled the recipe. That amount made a typical recipe of chocolate pudding. ty",

The caloric value of both white and coconut sugar are the same and since we watch caloric intake and coconut sugar is not readily available I felt the substitution would not significantly change the recipe. I did combine the dry ingredients in the saucepan first and whisked the almond milk into them. Added the vanilla after removing from heat. Since this recipe is already relatively low calorie and healthy I saw no reason to add egg oil or coconut to it as one reviewer suggested. It's delicious as is and those additions only add calories without really improving the recipe. That said everyone doesn't have the same tastes or dietary requirements. This recipe as is is every bit as good as the high calorie full fat varieties. Thanks for a great recipe. Update: Added a pinch of cayenne with the vanilla and wow! That little kick was well received and an unexpected but pleasant flavor. (My \"pinch\" was a large one because I always double the recipe for 4 servings. Adjust your \"pinch\" to your recipe and spice preference.)",
