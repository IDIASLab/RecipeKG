Make sure you cook it at least 60 minutes... my eggplant was borderline cooked in a couple of places. I only used about 8 oz. of the goat cheese (as recommended by others) and added parmesan cheese to the top of mine at the end which I thought it needed. Next time I will add a light layer of parmesan and mozzarella to the goat cheese on top before cooking. And I will cook it 70 minutes to be sure the eggplant is completely cooked. It's just as good as my eggplant parm recipe without the extra step of breading and frying the eggplant before assembling... love skipping that step!",

I couldnt afford the goat cheese because I had to make a large batch so I could have dinner and lunch for the week.  I quadrupled the recipe and used a large container of fresh mozzella balls. It took the whole hour to bake, but it was worth it.  Cheesy, saucy. healthy, goodness.  Next time I will use my vegetable peeler to make long thin slices of the eggplant and use a firm cheese i can slice long and thin too.  I know it will take longer to layer, but I think the results will be well worth it.",
