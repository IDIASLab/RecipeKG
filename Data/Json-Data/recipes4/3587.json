If you cut these to soon you will need to eat it with a spoon. They firm up nicely once they have cooled completely.",

You really do need to wait until they cool completely (like a couple of hours) before you try to cut them or they will fall apart. The one problem that I did have was that they seemed to be too much for the size of the pan. When they were cooking it all boiled over and made a gigantic burned marshmallow mess in the oven. I might try to make them in a 9x13 next time. All in all the flavor is good and I do think tastes like a Caramel de Lite Bar",

They are just like what we always called magic cookie bars except with a chocolate crust instead of graham cracker crust. I actually think it's much better and easier with the chocolate cake mix. I would've easily given these five stars but I wasn't a big fan of the marshmallow on it. I didn't like the gummy texture they got and I think it would've been better without it.

Quick and easy however stretching the cake mixture to 10x15 was really stretching it to thin would have been better in a 8x10. As baked in a 10x15 jelly roll the bar it self didn't hold very well and didn't get holdable pieces without falling apart and the condensed milk was stretched as well not being able to coat everything evenly for the size it was asked to use. I've made bars like this before and the last recipes I've made required an 8x10 pan. I will make these again but adjust to a smaller vessel. TY.",
