        "description": "If you are looking to turn traditional waffles into a grain-free paleo treat, this recipe made with coconut flour is for you! I created this one on a hot Sunday morning in Laguna Beach, when I was setting up a quick homemade brunch that was healthier than the waffles you get when you eat out in a restaurant. I  feel making your own food is always the best option to maintain your healthy eating habit, so most of the time, I prefer to eat at home and only grab a drink when I am out. These paleo waffles are a winner: they are free from grains, dairy, and eggs and they have a delicious flavor.",
