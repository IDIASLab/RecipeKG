Rice as most of us know doesn't have a lot of flavor to begin with and will also absorb flavor just like noodles will. Cabbage also doesn't have a lot of flavor. So if you are someone who likes things to have a lot of flavor and zip or zest this needs to have a few things added to it. I always add my own blend of seasonings to any recipe I make. Here is what I did to make the meal tasty. I used everything in the recipe but instead of canned tomatoes I diced up a fresh tomato. I also added plenty of salt some pepper garlic 1/2 cup of shredded pepper jack cheese and 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese. I didn't use the olive oil. Everyone in the family loved it. Including my kids!",

The only things I did different was use minute rice because that is all I had on hand and made double what I should have on accident. It still is very yummy with the extra rice and will be great for my vegetarian friend coming over for St. Patty's Day. She will not eat anything with meat. Thanks for helping me out. A",

I also diced the cabbage instead of shredding it and cooked it 20 min longer. My husband as well 3 and 5 years old loved it and made it a main dish instead of a side. i will definatally make it again but next time i will try shrimp instead of the meat.",

I used 1.5 fresh medium tomatoes and diced one fresh jalepeno and added salt to taste to make up for the salt that would have been in canned veggies. I also used brown rice as I had some the right amount left over from a previous meal. It was quite tasty in a simple sort of way and the random jalepenos kind of made it fun.
