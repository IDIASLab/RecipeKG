I didn't have any fresh roasted chilies, so I used canned-5 of the little cans to equal 2 cups or so.  I increased the garlic to 6 cloves as suggested.  I also used 1 can of diced tomatoes with added chilies.  I chopped the onion, 2 of the cans of the chilies, the can of tomatoes with juice and the garlic together in my food processor.  I browned the cubed pork in olive oil and seasoned it with salt and pepper.  Then, all of it, including 4 cups of chicken broth went into my crock pot.  Near the end of cooking, I added the dried oregano and the pinch of cloves.  I never would have believed that the clove pinch would make such a difference, but it did.  I don't usually add cloves to recipes because I don't care for it; however, in this recipe, it is a must! Just before serving, I made a roux of olive oil and flour to thicken the sauce.  We made smothered Chile Verde burritos and it was delicious!",

And for the final touch, add 1 to 1 1/2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar. This thickens the chili and adds just the right amount of underlying smoothness to balance out the fire of the peppers. Also, depending on your peppers, you may want to add a few at a time. I had about 2 cups of good NM Hatchs that I added to a double recipe and it was plenty hot! A chacun son go\u00fbt!",

I made a few little changes to suit us: I added in 2 ears of fresh grilled corn, doubled the garlic, added in a few shakes of roasted cumin, and used about 2# of pork butt/shoulder total in the recipe. I floured the pork cubes lightly before sauteing to help create a little extra thickening as we like it thicker to go over burritos, omelets, etc. I used the Salsa Lisa brand of tomatillo/green chile salsa.  For the peppers I used 2 poblanos, 2 anaheims, 1 jalapeno & 1 small can of roasted diced green chiles. For me the heat was just right. I'll be making this for years to come, Thanks again!!!!",

I must say that I wasn't keen on the tomatillo sauce because I don't care for it but after cooking, resting, reheating and eating that and the pinch of cloves made the dish fantastic!!!  I recommend that each person make the recipe for the first time exactly as written.  If you want to make changes after that then do.  I also recommend making one day, cooling in fridge overnight and then reheating for best taste.  Once again, the biggest surprise was the pinch of ground cloves......really makes the dish.  Served ontop of freshly mashed potatoes.  OUTSTANDING!!!",

My only problem with was that it just never got to the consistency that I would have hoped for such as is with a conventional chili. It was much more loose almost like a soup. Even after I put almost all of the veggies through the blender as prescribed in the recipe the chili stayed too soup like to \"pour\" over anything much less a burrito. I ended up making it in a slow cooker so perhaps that's the reason. I will be trying it again so we'll just have to wait and see.",
