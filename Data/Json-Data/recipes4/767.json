It took a while to make, but it was not hard by any means - something you open a bottle of wine while making; by the time the wine is done, the incredible meal is done as well.  The white sauce TOTALLY makes the dish, and goes well with Ragu Traditional, which is mild enough to not overpower anything else.  The manicotti stuffing would definately have been bland, if not for the sausage and the Italian seasonings I added (this is a MUST).  Thanks though, adding this to my recipe box as I write this!!!!!!",

I agree with a previous reviewer that the chicken bouillon needs to be reduced or just removed completely.  Also, I used 3/4 pound of italian sausage mixed with 1/4 pound of ground sirloin along with 1 1/2 pounds of ricotta.  Doesn't really take as long as you think it would to prepare, especially if you condense down the instructions.  Will definately make this one again, but will omit the chicken bouillon.",

I have never made manicotti before and it turned out beautifully...actually quite proud of myself.  I did use a plastic bag as other reviewers stated to help \"stuff\" the noodles easier...and it worked really well.  Thanks for the post.",

I followed the recipe as it was writen & the hamburger didn't do much for the recipe. I would also add alot of spices. Would not try it again.",
