I'm not sure what that person meant by \"it didn't smell good\" because my mouth was watering by the smell the whole time I cooked it. I didn't cook it in water instead I just sprinkled it on while on the skillet. I added some onion powder as suggested I also added a pinch of cayenne pepper and a good dose of fresh-ground peppercorn melange. Next time I will add some more of both peppers to give it more of a kick. But as it is it melts in your mouth.",
