I sauteed some mushrooms and onions in a little butter with some salt and pepper and threw it on top with the rest of the ingredients. Instead of using basil, I used dried parsley, because I didn't have any basil. I also sprinkled the fish with garlic powder as well as fresh garlic because we LOVE garlic. Didn't use the tomatoes, not a fan of them. The butter and wine sauce was amazing, the fish was flaky and delicious...this recipe is a must!",
