I just can't justify eating a batter dipped sandwich. Hubby thought we should have deep fried candy bars with it hehe. Good recipe but not worth the calories.",

I couldn't find my FryDaddy, so I pan-fried it in a deep skillet in about an inch of oil........worked perfectly!!  I served with Brandied Blackberry Preserves and it was delicious!
