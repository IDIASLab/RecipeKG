I used ground turkey that I spiced like pork sausage would be spiced homemade marinara sauce (The Best Marinara Sauce Yet which is also from this site) whole wheat lasagna noodles and I used \"trim\" cottage cheese instead of ricotta only because a)we don't care for ricotta and b)I'm quite cheap. My egg white was from an organic egg. I had a few bites but my family inhaled the rest....even my littlest who LOVES lasagna. He couldn't tell there was zucchini in it!!! No leftovers. None. I'm low on money so I served this with homemade cornbread but next time I'll be sure to serve this with garlic bread to sop up some of the sauce from the plate. I'll for sure make this again. I'm impressed.",

I made a couple substitutions based on what I had on hand- no ricotta so used cream cheese(not a perfect substitute but it's still tasty- cottage cheese would be a better sub) lower fat mozzarella and sausage organic pasta sauce (lower sodium) and whole wheat noodles.

The only thing different was that I added more sauce (I don't like dry lasagna) for when I reheated it later....I love left overs. First of all the flavor is excellent and when you reheated it it tasted even better. It is a very filling and satisfying dish which is great for the cooler weather coming.",
