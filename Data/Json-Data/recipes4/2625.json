My partner and I really enjoy making Veggie Patties and have tried several of our own creations and this recipe served as a great base to start with. Admittedly I am a professional chef so most recipes I only use as a guide. A few pointers for those having problems with binding. Once my beans are cooked I slightly cool and use my kitchen aid to make a a chunky bean paste. I would also add the rice to this mix (although I substituted quinoa instead). Also if you are unsure if the mix will hold try a mini test pattie. This will also allow you to adjust seasoning as beans take a lot of salt and flavors come out with heat. Additional suggestions are try adding some grated carrot fresh parsley and also can go half and half with black beans and another of your favorites. As well I like to make a large batch of the mix and make my burger for dinner and shape the rest onto a parchment lined cookie sheet and freeze patties. Once frozen I portion them into packs. Make sure to keep a layer between them or it wont be fun pulling them apart! Jerk Mayo and cheese also top these off nice.",

Made exactly as written. For those reviewers who said that these didn't form into patties and crumbled when cooking you didn't follow the directions! Mixing thoroughly with your hands is a MUST. I started out mixing with a spoon and the mixture was dry and loose then I dove in with my hands and really mixed and mashed it up and that made all the difference! Had NO problems forming patties and very minimal crumbling only around the edges when cooking. There is no need for an egg in this recipe if you follow the directions.",

I've made these twice now for my family - once on buns with melted cheese lettuce sauteed onion and tomato and once as just patties with our favorite Jerk sauce sweet peppers and onions to complete a Caribbean themed meal - both were complete hits! Having small children I substituted the habanero with a jalapeno and also used a dash of cinnamon instead of the allspice as I didn't have any on hand. I made the recipe for 8 using two cans of drained and rinsed black beans. The fresh ginger is a must!",

I will definitely be making these again. The recipe also make a lot more than six patties which is OK because I'm looking forward to the leftovers.",
