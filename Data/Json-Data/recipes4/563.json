I hope everyone that tries this recipe reads the ratings first! \n\nI changed this recipe to go as follows (based on the suggestions of the other raters--and then it should come out more like 4-5 stars!):\n\nIngredients:\n6 Boneless Pork Chops (Or really whatever you want to use...even chicken)\n1 onion sliced\n1-2 Cans Cream of Mushroom soup (depending on how saucy you want it-I used 1 can cream of mush., and 1 can cream of chick.)\n1/2 Cup Beer (I prefer to use dark ale)\nS&P, Garlic Salt, Seasoning Salt to prefrence\n\nSeason pork with above seasonings. Fry onions & pork in olive oil or butter in skillet until browned. Place in crock pot. In seperate bowl, mix together soups & beer, and pour into crock pot. (I added a dab of BBQ sauce). Cook on low 6-8 hours or on high 2-4 hours.\n\nGood luck! This recipe, in my opinion, is worth trying if tweaked.",

Glad I didn't but be forewarned...if you don't like beer (as the name of the recipe obviously implies) don't bother with this recipe. BUT in defense of those less-than-favorable reviewers - I can see where this would be bland without some modifications. Took \"Midnight Angel's\" advice: Took 6 chops and did a quick fry in some butter all season salt and onion/garlic powders (all to taste). I then mixed the beer (reduced by half) w/ a can of cream of mushroom soup a dash of chicken boullion granuels added some garlic and ofcourse - the onions. Baked at 325 degrees for apprx 2.5 hours. Perfect. Fork tender and my roommate was dousing the chops in the gravy this produced. My daughter thought this was chicken and raved. My boyfriend wished there was more. With the listed modifications I will surely make this again!!",

After reading them I thought I would use some hints and my own tips to better this recipe to our taste buds. Tried it and it was a Fav! Was wonderful! Here is what I did.... My variation Half the amount of beer. Pinch each of: Onion Salt - Mrs. Dash - Lawry's Seasoning Salt - Pepper - 1 can Cream Of Mushroom w/ Roasted Garlic (used Campbell's variety) This time using thinner pork chops lightly floured them and seared them just to the browning point in 2 tbsp of oil (butter would work too) before placing in the 9x13 pan. Added the onions next. Sprinkled w/ seasonings and then the soup mixed w/ the beer. I cooked this in a 325 degree oven for about 2 hours (pork chops were thinner - so didnt need that much cooking time) Times will vary I suppose on size. We will be eating this again real soon! And next time will use thicker pork chops as well. Also I had a great easy one step gravy mixture for using over mashed potatoes.",

Lightly browned about 2 1/2 cups of baby bella mushrooms. Layered onion rings in the bottom of crockpot. Covered in a layer of crushed garlic (3) Placed chops on top. Poured mushrooms over chops Poured a mixture over chops of: 1 bottle of negro modelo beer 1 can of cream of mushroom soup lots of garlic powder 2 pinches dried basil 2 pinches dried oregano 1 pinch paprika few shakes of lawry's seasoning salt fresh ground pepper and 2 drops tabasco. I let it cook for 5 hours total. The first 45 minutes I did it on high then put it on low. 1 hour before serving I thickened the sauce by adding cornstarch... then put on high until boiling. Once it started boiling I let it boil for 5 minutes or so then put it back on low with the cover cracked until time to serve. I do not eat meat and I am allergic to mushrooms so I did not get to try this but my fiance and his buddy LOVED it ate every bite. I only wish I would've had time today to make mashed potatoes... I will for sure make them next time. Both boys said the beer flavor was not strong at all. I think it was the beer I used. If you want the beer flavor mellow then use a mellow beer if you want it strong use an IPA.... the more hoppy the beer the stronger the beer flavor. I think the negro modelo was perfect.",
