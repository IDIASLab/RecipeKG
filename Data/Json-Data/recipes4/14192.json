After taste testing the soup I did add 1 tsp. oregano 1 tsp. basil 1 tbsp. brown sugar a little worchestershire sauce and a couple good shakes Frank's hot sauce. That's all personal taste but as a base this is a cost-effective hearty soup that made a great dinner paired with cuban midnight sandwiches. Thanks!",
