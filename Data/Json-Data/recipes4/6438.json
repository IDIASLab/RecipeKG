But, this recipe was AWESOME!!! I may add a bit more spinach the next time I make it, just for my own personal taste. I love my food spicy so the amount of red pepper flakes was just right...however I would caution that it maybe too spicy for young kids but AGAIN this recipe was FANTASTIC!!!!

Cut the pepper flakes in half and was still too spicy. Everything else was as written. Just had way too much pepper and onion for us.... leftovers went to waste. If we were too do it again I would omit the pepper flakes cut way back on the onion possibly cook them until carmelized instead of translucent add more mushrooms and spinach as wasn't near enough.",
