I added about half a tablespoon of red pepper flakes to help kick up the flavor a bit and I used a tablespoon of Italian Seasoning instead of the dried parsley, oregano, and basil because I didn't have those ingredients.  I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes along with a 14.5oz can of the diced tomatoes and was really glad I did, I think the pasta might have been too dry otherwise.    After mixing the sauce, pasta, and cheese pour the whole thing into a large baking dish, cover with foil, and bake in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes or until the sauce is bubbling around the edges.  Uncover and top with parmesan and bake for another 5 minutes until the cheese bubbles and browns.  SO TASTY!  My husband (who is usually not a fan of ground turkey) said he didn't even know it was turkey until he was about halfway through his meal and I told him!",
