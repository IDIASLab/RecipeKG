I didn't use the full amounts of salt/pepper, milk or parmesan cheese. I just added to taste. I really wanted to watch the calorie count and a thicker soup. This soup was very filling and I loved the combination of all the ingredients. The potatoes and cauliflower fooled me into thinking I was having a rich potato soup when it was really cauliflower soup with a hint of potato. GREAT for me as I'm watching my carbs but I miss my potatoes terribly. I'd like to make this again but I think I would roast the cauliflower with the potatoes next time and maybe add a little more garlic.  As is, GREAT soup.",

Oh also added frozen peas for more color. Delicious!! It will make our rotation!!",
