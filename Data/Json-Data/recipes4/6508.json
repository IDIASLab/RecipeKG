Also before I had heated the oil and bay leaves I had prepped the meat, onions and mushrooms ahead of time this to prevent the burning of the bay leave as per one reviewer had mentioned.  Then as they were frying prepped the tatters and carrots.  Will be making again.",

He loved this dish! He loved the texture the venison the veggies and the broth and he does NOT like Guinness beer! He said the combination of the ingredients worked really well together. I purchased 1 can of Guinness for this recipe. I freaked out when I poured the Guinness in the pan. There was something in the can that moved. I got a flashlight to see what it was. It was a milky white ball. I told my hubby I thought it was an eyeball. He assured me it wasn't but he took the can apart to be sure. LOL Never having purchased a can of Guinness I wasn't aware that there is a ball of nitrous. It helps create the foamy frothiness when you pour out the beer. All that being said hubby loved his dinner and told me to \"feel free to make this one again!\" Thanks dad2twins for sharing your recipe!",

However the bay leaf burned in the pan before I could add the beef. I removed it and added another when moving to the oven. My only change was to use leftover medium rare beef with a little extra broth to compensate for juices that fresh might have contributed. I halved the recipe so used a 3qt pot and after 2 hours the carrots were perfect the potatoes were just done and the onions all but disappeared. It came out of the oven with no liquid. There was a light coating on the chunks but I could have easily ate this from a plate with a fork. Since the description says to have some sopping bread handy this was not the texture I expected. It tasted great but I then I added another 1.5 cups broth to get to what's in my photo. I would make it again but with more liquid from the start(both beer and broth so as not to change the flavor ratio).",

The rest of the ingredients are nearly identical to how I typically make stew so aside from making some minor modifications the difference was pretty much just the beer. First I prepared it all on the stove only because that s my comfort zone. (Simmer beef for about 1-1/2 hours before adding the vegetables this needs no more but no less cooking time. Simmer another half hour or so once you add the vegetables. Thicken as necessary at the end with a flour slurry) In addition to the potatoes and carrots I added cabbage chunky slices of celery and sliced mushrooms - because I always do - because it tastes good. The stew was very good. But it surprisingly tasted no different with the new ingredient beer. Now of course I don t expect the stew to taste like beer. What I am saying however is that since neither I nor Hubs detected any difference between this stew made with beer and the stew I typically make without it I say keep it in the ingredients list but drink it while you re making the stew.",

Also I did add the bay leaves to the oil even though I was suspicious. Unfortunately as I feared they burnt to a crisp in no time at all. So I added some into the dish before it went into the oven so that the bay flavor could really get into there. And finally I didn't add the fresh parsley until I pulled it out of the oven because if you add it too early all the freshness and brightness will cook right out of it. The sauce was pretty yummy even though I think there was a touch too much flour in it... didn't stop me from sopping it up with my bread! Might make again with a few tweaks next time.
