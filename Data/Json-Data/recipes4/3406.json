Used a roast as that's all I had in the freezer and was not about to venture out in near blizzard/white out conditions for short ribs.  Only two changes based on personal preference....  added garlic and used low sodium beef stock to counter the sodium in the Bloody Mary mix.  Put all into the crockpot and let the smell permeate the house while watching the snow.  Served over rice with a small green salad.  Perfect antidote to turkey after Thanksgiving day. Thanks RCHEISS for the recipe!",

I followed the recipe exactly except only used 2 cups bloody mary mix, added 4 gloves smashed garlic. Other than that, I made no changes.  This is the first recipe that I made in my new Dutch Oven.  I served the ribs on the side and other ingredients on top of long grain wild rice with mashed potatoes on the side.  I know... 2 starches but hubby wanted the mashed.  Absolutely fabulous!!!! Thanks for a great recipe!!!!",
