When I make it with steak I use beef broth instead of chicken broth.  I like to use Mahesh Curry Powder which is tan coloured, very flavourful,and somewhat hotter then the yellow stuff from the grocery store.  I also use fresh chopped onion (1) and fresh minced garlic cloves (4) instead of the dehydrated stuff.  I also add 2.5 cups of frozen peas and carrots and a cup of chopped sweet green bell pepper to make it a complete meal.  It's great served over rice which I flavour with 1 tsp. each of lemon and coconut or almond extracts per 4 cups of cooked rice. I just add the extracts to the water when making the rice.",

I followed the recipe exactly except that I had only 1-1/3 tbsp curry powder and as I did not have coconut oil I used sesame oil. I would use the full 2 tbsp of curry powder next time but would continue to use sesame oil as that is what I have on hand. There is lots of sauce of perfect consistency which is great with rice.
