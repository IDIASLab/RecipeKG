I changed it up a bit by using chicken broth for the water and just put the dry beans (that had been washed and picked over) into the crockpot.  Cooked on High for about 6 hours, turned down to low for 2 more.  Very tender, no soaking required.  I did add a small onion and salt & pepper.  I mashed the leftovers to make refried beans (no frying needed) for 2 more meals.  So for $1 I'll get 6 meals.  Not too bad using a left over ham bone from a spiral sliced ham.",

They should be cooked at a hard boil (adding water as needed) for about 3 1/2 hrs  or until fork tender. When fully cooked, mash a few beans with a potato masher right in the pot to thicken the soup and salt to taste.  Pintos should always be eaten with cornbread and a selection of chopped onion and/or tabasco sauce added to the bowl.  A little hot pepper juice added to the bowl is also very good, if you like it hot and spicy.",
