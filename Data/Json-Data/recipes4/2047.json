Only thing I changed was to use half water-half chicken broth to start cooking the beans and I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the fresh as they are soooo expensive. I will make these often as I now prefer these to refried beans. Thank you Kim!!",

I still added the jalepenos and did not find the heat too much. The only other modification I made was adding 2 packets of Goya Sazon because I really find that it adds so much to the taste.  For the people who said their been took a lot longer, you most likely have old beans (even if you just bought them). There's really no way to tell, but try to shop at a Mexican grocery store if there is one in your city.  The product is turned over much faster there. I'm happy to have found this recipe to add to my bean dish collection. It is a grate side to some simple quesidillas.",
