I didn't have enough but it still turned out fine.  The only other modifications I did were to cut back to 1T of oil, use Mexican oregano instead of regular, and I only used about 3T of chili pepper because we don't like really spicy food.  This amount was perfect for us.  The broth tasted just like restaurant Posole...the only difference was the chicken instead of pork but that was just as good or even better!  ",
