I put this chili on in the morning after browning the pork and cooking the bacon/onions into the crock pot. Let it go on high for 6 hours. Amazing. Added some sour cream to top it off. Some of our ideas were to let the chili thicken I mean really thicken - simmer off until it resembles creamy refried beans and make burritos - our use it as a base for a tostado. We will surely have this meal again especially in the upcoming winter months... If we get any winter...",
