I did have to make a few changes (simply due to what ingredients I had on hand): I didn't have plain Greek yogurt but vanilla flavored so I used that mixed with a little bit of sour cream. I also didn't have agave nectar so I used honey and only a 1/3 of a cup of it due to the fact that the yogurt I used had added sugar in it. Other than that I did everything as written. It's a dense moist tangy and flavorful way to use up some blood oranges. The only little issue that I had is that when I added the \"blood orange syrup\" to the warm cake it fell in. Not a huge deal but it might be better to let it cool quite a bit before pouring it on.",
