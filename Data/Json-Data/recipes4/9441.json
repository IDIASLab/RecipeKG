I was so surprised.  When I dished myself up a plate I did my ususal, \"OK, I'm not going to have 2nds.\" but I totally wanted more (and I did... i have no will power).  I love this recipe because I didn't really have to measure anything - just tossed the ingredients in and simmered.  I did do some things differently (not because I didn't trust the author) - I used sweet potatoes instead if regular (bc it's what I had) pre-marinated chicken breasts (new perdue product), fresh tomato (bc it's what i had), mahatma rice (ditto) and i added some cayenne.  I think the cayenne and pre-marinated chicken added some extra flavor.  I'll totally make it again.  thank you!",
