I took chicken out and filtered out any thick fat floating around the pot. hand pulled the chicken from the fat/bone while tossing chicken back in along with the sausage and onion. I put the rice salts and peppers and left the can of mushroom out for now. Stirred. Kept heat on low since it kept simmering.. Checked every 5 minutes to see if rice was soft. I added chicken broth as needed to make thickness what I wanted added cream of mushroom once rice was soft. Turned off stove and served once it stopped simmering. I served this alongside peas and collared greens. Awesome comfort food for cold days. I changed the recipe around for convenience and what we had in our store. Took me about 2.5 hrs to make. I gave 5/5!",

Followed recipe except with two minor changes: -Pressure cooked the thighs instead of boiled to cut down on time- pressure cooked for 8 minutes so the recipe was a fairly quick one. Poured in just 2 cups of water and 1 boullion. Added chicken stock from a carton to adjust stock afterward so there was 4.5 cups -Added dried cayenne in addition to red pepper (cut up two whole dried peppers) Very good quick and tasty!",
