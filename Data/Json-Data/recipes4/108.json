To make it a bit less bland, soak the raw potatoes in cold salt water for a couple hours.  Drain them and par boil them with a can of chicken broth in the water.  This gives the potatoes more flavor and cuts down on the baking time.",

After reading the reviews I modified it slightly by adding salt to each layer adding a little crushed garlic to the milk & soup sprinkling the top with crushed rosemary and baking it at 450 for one hour covered. Then I topped it with French Fried Onion rings and let it brown in the oven for an additional 10 minutes. It was great! Will definitely serve this at a dinner party.",
