Because I did use homemade jalapeno rings I cut it back quite a bit.

I put a big bowl of chips in between the 2 dips and everyone raved... Great combo!! This was very refreshing and enticing the cilantro/jalapeno is just great!!! 3/6/2010 UPDATE Made for another party and people couldn't get enough! Served this time with carrots celery and quartered cherry tomatoes. Yum!! Then we put it on hamburgers later that night as a spread. I'd give it 10 stars if I could!",
