The only thing I changed was to add an ice cube's worth of lemon juice to the sauce because I didn't have any dry wine. I really wanted to take a picture before I ate but it smelled too good and I had to dive right in! Good one Gina!",

I will agree. One the cooking time of 1 hour is way too long. I'd try 30 minutes and then use a thermometer to check if the chicken is done. The stuffing needs something maybe cream cheese or mayo or lemon but its totally bland. The sauce needs more too. There are no spices in the sauce. I cut the cookie crumbs in half. I don't like stuffing that is over breaded. Mine worked out pretty well in that regard other than lacking flavor.",
