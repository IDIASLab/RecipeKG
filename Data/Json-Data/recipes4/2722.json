This is a really nice marinade/glaze because it lets the salmon flavor come through. I was worried it would taste like teriyaki but it did not. Very subtle. Fresh ginger tip: freeze your fresh ginger in a baggie and grate it frozen peel and all. The peel comes off on the front side of the peeler and doesn't get into your dish. You also don't need to bother with putting it in the tinfoil boat to marinade. We did it in a baggie. Tonight we're going to plank it after marinading instead of cooking it in the sauce.",
