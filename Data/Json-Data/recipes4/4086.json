But it takes a special, international inclination to make the case for kielbasa with Brussels sprouts, white beans, and mustard. I'll tell you that it works wonderfully! The saltiness of the pork combined with the bitter, gentle crunch of the Brussels sprouts and mildness of the beans is well-balanced perfection. Plus, it's cheap, easy, and looks good on a plate!",

I like kielbasa and Brussels sprouts but I wouldn\u2019t have thought to put the two together.  I didn\u2019t have high expectations for this \u2013 after all, it was just a humble mix of a few simple ingredients.  I even went to the market just to buy the coarse ground Dijon it called for.  Well, Hubs and I were both surprised and impressed. This was just excellent and we marveled at how much it exceeded our expectations.  I skipped the step of roasting the shallots and garlic as I couldn\u2019t see heating up the oven for it.  Saut\u00e9ing those before I added the mustard and cream obviously worked just fine, as this was one, delicious sauce!  It got a little thick, so rather than adding more cream I thinned it out with half and half, which worked well.  I\u2019m wondering if half and half would have worked well in the first place \u2013 and then I wouldn\u2019t have had to open a carton of cream for this. The combination of the kielbasa, the Brussels sprouts, the beans (which I almost skipped and I\u2019m SO glad I didn\u2019t!) and the mustard cream sauce produced a flavor, a dish, unlike anything either Hubs or I ever had before.   And we enjoyed it thoroughly.  I served this alongside parsley buttered noodles with a tossed green salad.  Maybe it was BECAUSE of the few and simple ingredients that this was so good.",

The only thing I would change is that I would maybe add even a little more sauce and I would definitely cut the brussels sprouts in half before adding to the sauce. The sauce would then seep more inside the sprouts and would give a more even flavor. I can't understand why reviewers are reviewing the recipe based on the picture not the taste. Really my dish turned out looking edible and besides that's not the point anyway! I always look at reviews before deciding to try a dish. People who give bad review based on a picture are dragging down the average score of a dish they didn't even try unfairly. I think the site should remove those reviews and ban those reviewers. This is not a photography site. In short the recipe is good and worth trying for a unique dinner.",

                "reviewBody": "For me this was a solid three stars as is. For 5 stars I reconstituted dried white kidney beans rather than the canned. This cut down on some of that sticky white ick that even thoroughly rinsing doesn't remove from canned beans. Reconstituting dried beans also makes for firmer beans so the dish is not as mushy. Secondly it was just a bit on the bland side for my taste so I added about a tablespoon of red wine vinegar to the sauce and it gave it that little extra kick I was looking for. Also try this with Thai sweet and sour sausage instead of the kielbasa for a different taste.",
