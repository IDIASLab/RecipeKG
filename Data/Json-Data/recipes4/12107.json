I don\u2019t add much, if any, water because I prefer a stiffer dough that I roll into a log and just cut slices to bake as needed.  Also, I found that if I bake at 250 for 15 minuts, flip, then bake another 15 minutes, the bottoms won\u2019t burn.  I rate this recipe 5 stars because the basis includes ingredients that are very healthy for dogs so you can feel good about feeding these treats to your \u2018kids\u2019 and it\u2019s easy peasy!!",

The second batch I made with beef and gravy baby food and then I piped them with a frosting tip.  I used a sandwich bag with the corner cut off and a big tip on it.  I made closer to 75 cookies that way. They kinda looked like little hershey kisses.  I baked for 15 minutes.  The kidz totally approved.",

I could not find liver in the baby food aisle so I used a jar of chicken and gravy. Thanks so much for these winners! UPDATE: I roll about a teaspoon in little balls and then press them down on the cookie sheet to make a cookie shape. I also bake these at 250 for 15 minutes and flip them over and bake for another 15 minutes so the bottoms don't get too brown. Still have not found liver baby food, but the chicken & gravy baby food seems to suit her just fine. We love this healthy treat! UPDATE II  i had no wheat germ so I subbed dry infant rice cereal and it worked perfectly. I now triple the recipe at Christmas so I can give out little gift bags to our neighbor dogs??",
