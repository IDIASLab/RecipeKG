I sprinkled squash with a little salt and pepper before baking as instructed. I pretty much followed basic above recipe but... Subbed plain Greek yogurt for sour cream; added diced green apple to sauted onion, mushroom,celery, & added minced garlic, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper. To the egg, yogurt, and parm cheese I Added 1/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar. Mixed both together and added 3/4 cup cooked brown rice. Scooped out some of acorn squash, to make more room for stuffing but then mixed loose squash into meat mixture. Packed into squash and topped with mixture of panko crumbs mixed, melted butter And parsley. Backed 20minutes then 1-2minutes at broil to crisp/brown up topping. See my photo of yummy end result",

He said it was restaurant quality. DH doesn't like mushrooms, so I left those out and added red bell pepper. The other change I made was how I cooked the squash--I did it my usual way of putting some water in the bottom of a baking pan, put the cut sides down, and baked at 350 for 45 min.  When I added the stuffing, I upped the oven to 375 and followed the recipe. It cooked perfectly. Thanks for an excellent recipe!",

I heated the squash in the microwave for 2-3 minutes to make it easier to cut and scoop out seeds. We actually prepped everything the night before...baked the squash and made the filling, but stored separately in fridge. The next day it was so easy to just put together and warm in oven. We followed the recipe, but threw in some extra mushrooms and added some shredded cheese on top the last 5 minutes of baking. Everyone loved it! I can't wait to make again.",

My wife who is very particular loved it and said it was the best she had ever eaten.I did prepare it exactly as written but I have a suggestion. to make it simpler to prepare. When the squash is cut  turn it upside down on a glass plate in the microwave covered with a plastic hood on high for 12 minutes. you need a layer of water on the plate A shorter time might do for smaller squash.( Microwave 900 watts) This will ensure that the squash is perfectly tender and has no uncooked fibrous strands. I have just made this a second time but used a buttercup squash. this squash is a little larger and should be cut in half as with the acorn squash. Each half again is put upside down on a glass plate with I/2 inch of water in the microwave and cook for 6 minutes. ( do each 1/2 separately). then fill each half as in the recipe with the sausage mixture and bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes this cuts the cooking time from the original recipe. the flavor of this squash is excellent.",

The only thing I have started doing differently is when I scoop out all the squash I mix it up in a bowl then put it into a cast iron skillet to bake off. Oh and I will interchange nonfat greek yogurt for the sour cream too. I think it changes a little each time I make it but I always seem to mangle my squash skins while scooping. Enjoy!",
