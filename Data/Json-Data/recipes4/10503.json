I disagree that a boxed strawberry cake mix would be the same or easier. For one thing I could not find a strawberry cake mix when I shopped. And the margarita mix adds just that slight bit of tangy flavor that makes it taste well margarita-ish. The only other change I made was to add fresh halved strawberries on top. Oh and I tossed the lime zest with a tiny tiny bit of sugar. The cake was a hit.",
