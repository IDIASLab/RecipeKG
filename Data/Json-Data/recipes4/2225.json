I mde two pies, one as is and it was just fabulous.  (Well, not quite as is.  I used Jarlsberg instead of Gruyere because it was about 1/3 the price).\n\nI made two because I don't want to be THAT person who says how I changed everything, but I did make a different version that I also liked a lot.\n\nI fried a few pieces of bacon, removed them and softened the leeks in the bacon drippings, then crumbled the bacon back in with the cheese and cream. I did a layer of this mixture, then a layer of ripe sliced tomato, then covered it with the remainder of the cheese and cream mixture.  Baked the same way.  Also extremely delicious.\n\nSo, this recipe is GREAT as is, but can also be modified if desired!  Which makes it a 5-star recipe to me.",

This is very close in taste if you saut\u00e9e the vegetables in bacon instead of butter.  I used 3 slices of chopped bacon and the result was heavenly.  I think it would be a bit lacking in taste without the bacon... A bit of ham might work too but then butter would be required.",

I was afraid that even it was a bit strong but the flavors blended very nicely and there were no leftovers. A really mild cheese blended with some Parmesean would also work. For my taste I think the original recipe with the Gruyere would be best but if you also have picky eaters you can adjust. Changed my ranking to 3 stars as I liked it but my husband emphasized when I made it again that he REALLY didn't care for it.",

Easy enough to double, and maybe try the Gruyere or Swiss mixed with another similar cheese. Thanks for an amazing recipe!",
