These were considerably breadier than I prefer but that might be a discrepancy between the submitter's interpretation of \"half a loaf\" of Italian bread and mine. No matter. That's something easily adjusted and a matter of personal taste anyway. Even if I thought them a little bready that did not discount the fact they were incredibly aromatic and flavorful. I'm sure both the chicken broth and the small amount of Italian sausage are responsible for that. Still if it is easier for a cook giving this a whirl to just use all beef or a pre-packaged \"meatloaf\" mix of beef pork and veal the meatballs would be equally as good.",

I baked the meatballs rather than frying and as the aroma was wafting through the house he kept murmuring how good they smelled. Then when out of the oven he kept circling the baking pan. I told him to have one and he said no that he wanted to wait until tomorrow's dinner. What control! Well I didn't wait. Popped one in my mouth to devour a little bit of heaven in one bite!
