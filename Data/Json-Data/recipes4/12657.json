On poster commented that they would skip the boiling water part.  I would recommend against this.  The reason for boiling the apples is to remove the wax from the skin and help the caramel stick to the apple better.  They only need to be dipped in the boiling water for a few seconds though, not left in.  I just roll mine through the water and remove them.  Although dipping them in chocolate might seem overwhelming to some people, be careful if you try to make them without coating them in something.  Despite the fact that the caramel hardens, it WILL stick to cellophane if it is not coated in something.  I don't sell plain ones because of this.  I recommend trying this recipe different ways.  I use mini M&M's or Reese's pieces, crushed oreos, nuts, sprinkles, etc.  They go over very well with everyone who has had them thus far!  The most popular are the ones I roll in nuts and then dip in chocolate though!",

I can control the temp of the candies that way. I also put the apples in the fridge for about 30 minutes in between each application of candy. This chilled the aplles so dipping wouldn't create a big blobby mess of caramel & chocolate. I bought white chocolate & melted it & added color into it instead of buying the colored stuff. I got lots & kudos for these apples!",

I personally love melting a few squares of Bakers white chocolate and adding a tablespoon or so of peanut butter to that and when melted drizzling it all over the apple. HIGHLY Recommended recipe, I made these several times within the last few days. I only get 2 large apples out of this recipe or 3 small ones, but I REALLY dip my apples into the chocolate for full and thick coverage.",

Maybe just drizzle the chocolate on for a little flavor in every bite. They are easy to make and lovely to look at. We gave a bunch as gifts to happy recipients. Make sure to select a good, tart apple that can stand up to this much sugar. And I would skip the boiling water part next time as it softened the skins so much that they started peeling off. Maybe that was my fault for leaving them in the water for a good ten seconds. This is a great idea and delicious.",

I waited the 15 minuted that the recipe calls for and when I dipped the chocolate layer ALL of the chocolate ran off it was horrible. Once we let them sit in the fridge we were able to go back and re-dip them. Also cut the amount of shorting in half I really feel that's why I ran into trouble.
