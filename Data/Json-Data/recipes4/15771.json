He said it was very moist - and that was using 4% fat hamburg which is usually very dry. I mostly followed the recipe but used a jarred tomato sauce instead of soup and water. I think that was a much richer more flavorful choice. I also added parmesan and seasonings to my bread crumbs and a pinch of salt and pepper to the dish. FYI I scaled this down to 5oz of hamburg for a serving for one but it actually made quite a bit and would have served 2. (The photo shows just half the amount it made.) So keep in mind this recipe makes a lot!!! Ok onto the presentation. Please see my photo. I don't know how to say this delicately but the entree looks like...uh...a natural bodily function that a person would not want on their plate. It's fine for family with a sense of humor but I would not serve this to guests. Jokes aside enough said. Anyway since I don't eat meat I took the rest of the zucchini filling then added it to the carved out insides of a summer squash added tomatoes cheese spices (whatever you want) and made myself an entree and my Dad a side dish (again see photo). I put the veggies in the oven for just the last 15 minutes added some boiled red potatoes and voila. An easy delicious colorful healthy dinner that was pretty easy to make. I will make this again.",

Armed with this info, I baked mine a bit differently: I poked a few holes in the bottom of the zucchini with a toothpick, and baked them on cooling racks on a baking sheet. There was no grease collected in the zucchini at all!",

I couldn't get my hand on extra-large zucchini so I used regular-grocery sized (about 5 and used ALL the insides for the filling). Changes I made: 1 large sweet yellow onion diced fine 1 full-sized jar marinara - instead of the tomato soup/water 1 lb. ground beef - instead of 1.5 lbs. 4 cloves garlic minced - instead of garlic powder 1.5 tbsp. Italian seasoning This made way too much for four servings! I stuffed the 10 zucchini halves for dinner one night and put the rest in a loaf pan for \"meatloaf\" (cooked the loaf at 350 for 50 minutes then 5 more for the cheese). Delicious leftovers and the whole family loves it - little do they know how many vegetables are in it!!!",
