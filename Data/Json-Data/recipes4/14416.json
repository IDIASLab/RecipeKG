Make sure to use unsweetened coconut-- I almost grabbed the wrong one out of the pantry and I think that would have ruined it. Thanks for the great recipe!",

And finally I didn't steam with a little water but just used the heat from the oils. It was a little bitter so maybe it was the leaves. I will try this again with more care.
