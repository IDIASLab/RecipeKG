Since package sizes of brownie mix vary, I also always follow the package directions rather than what's directed in this recipe. This is a real crowd pleaser for those who like their sweet treats rich, gooey and decadent and is easily put together with pantry ingredients likely already at hand. Once the bars are firm, there is no need to keep them refrigerated.",

They are so gooey and delicious, and the crunch from the rice crispy puts it over the top! I recommend using Betty Crocker's fudge brownie mix and under bake by a few minutes so that when you put the marshmallows on top and continue cooking the brownies won't get too done by the end. Cover the entire brownie mix with the marshmallows because once they're baked you don't want to try and spread or smear them or you'll just get a mess. Really let it cool before pouring the chocolate/peanut butter topping on so the marshmallows won't smear off. Such a good recipe!",

For the brownie portion I used Ghiradelli brownie mix from Costco but followed the directions on the box and then put it in a 9x13 inch glass dish for 28 min.  I didn't change anything else.  I think that your favorite brownie mix/recipe is what you should use. We had several people over for dinner and served this for dessert.  Everyone LOVED it!  It is now one of our favorite desserts. Next time I am going to try some of it without the rice krispies because I think that I personally will like it better without them but everyone else liked the crunch.",
