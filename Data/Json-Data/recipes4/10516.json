                "reviewBody": "This turned out to be one of the yummiest things I've ever made. Like other people, I didn't need 7 potatoes, I only used 5 medium potatoes. I left out the rosemary because I didn't have any. To the one cup of water I added just enough red cooking wine to turn the water pink, then added about 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce. I didn't have any steak seasoning on hand, either, so I used about 1 tbsp Herb Chicken Seasoning and 2 tbsp parsley. Also, I used carrots and fresh sliced mushrooms instead of the mixed veggies - didn't have any of those on hand, either. I did use all the other ingredients as directed.\n\nAlso, when I drained the fat from the beef, there was still a bit of grease left in the pan, so I put the mushrooms, onion flakes plus 1 tbsp minced garlic in the pan. I let them saute for a little bit, then put the beef back in the pan and added the rest of the ingredients. Boyfriend said the first time I made this that it was too salty for him (he avoids salt like the plague) so I've stopped putting in salt and have switched to sodium-free or low-salt bouillion cubes. I've stuck with the herb chicken seasoning, though. \n\nI also put shredded cheddar cheese on top of the potatoes, once everything was loaded into the casserole dish. I've made Shepherd's Pie before, but this one was by far the best one ever.",

Like the other reviewees I made my potatoes like regular mashed and added butter a dash of garlic powder and milk. I didn't like the rosemary so I changed that to parsley. I also added 1 package of brown gravy mix at the end which made it very savory. You still must reduce the water down to about a 1/4 cup otherwise its too watery. I also added added a clove of garlic but that's the Italian in me! The frozen peas and carrot mix made it very simple. A sure keeper for my family!!!!",

Therefore, we would recommend leaving out the salt AND the steak spice.  Also, the recipe states that it feeds 12.  This must be an error because we only fed 4 but probably could get 5 out of it.Thank you, however, for your wonderful recipes.  Generally, we love them.",

I made a few adjustments - I read the reviews and listen to them with the mashed potato to add milk & butter - I used Lipton's Beefy onion soup mix instead of the beef bouillon & onion flakes - I left out chicken bouillon and Rosemary - just because I don't like rosemary herb.  I used 5 Tbsp ketchup and 1 Tbsp.Worcestershire sause and frozen peas & carrots - It was so tasty, this recipe is definitely a keeper!!!",
