Next time I would reduce the fluid just a tiny bit (maybe 1/8 of  a cup) as I think they would set better if using quick grits.  This would also be fantastic with ham or bacon too or any combination of meats.  In the future, I may add a tiny bit of cheese to the top the last few minutes of baking.\nI will definitely make this again.  It was a huge hit with my family.",
