The only thing I didn't have on-hand was the cream of mushroom soup, so I made my own (2 Tbls butter; 1 large chopped mushroom; 3 Tblsp flour; 1 cup milk and 1 tsp chicken bouillon granules). For the green taco sauce, I used a 12 oz. jar of Herdez Tomatillo Verde sauce (the entire jar) and for the chicken, I actually had some sliced chicken meat that I just shredded in my food processor. I only mixed half of the sauce with the chicken, filled the tortillas, and then used the remaining half of the sauce on top. Served this with some rice and beans and pico de gallo on the side.",

I used Trader Joes Homemade tortillas, their 12 oz salsa verde, and sharp cheddar. I had 2 large chicken breasts, instead of 3, but it was 1 1/3 lbs. I sprinkled them lightly with garlic salt and onion powder and broiled them on a foil lined sheet. They were done in the time it took me to mix up the rest of the ingredients. I used all the ingredients, but the green chilis as the salsa verde already included them and was 12 oz. I covered and baked as suggested, but didnt do the second bake uncovered. I baked the after preparing instead of 12 hours later. I am glad, because the bottoms were already slightly soggy. That wouldnt have been good. I think these taste similar to the pulled chicken enchiladas at Chuys. They are a little salty, but not unexpected with the soup. I would make these again when wanting to save time. I recalculated the calories, as made above, and it came to 216 calories each.",
