First I reduced the milk to 1 cup and no water at all then I added 3/4 cup of flour instead of a 1/2 added a 2tsp of baking powder and 1 cup of honey instead of 1/2 so they are a bit sweeter. My family loved them and so did I. Definitely will make them again!",

Doesn't make 24 full muffins probably because of the liquid reduction might be better to make less and fill the cups. They were done in about 20 minutes. I'm not sure what Gisela was hoping for; I've never heard of muffins turning into flowers;). Perfectly sweet nutty and healthy I might try rinsing the quinoa first to get rid of any bitterness.",

If you look at the pumpkin & milk vs flour (quinoa & wheat) ratio it seems like you need more flour but the batter was the right consistency as muffins. Maybe less pumpkin and it would be a good recipe. I also added a lot more sweetener to it & it still is not sweet enough (Yeah I like my muffins like cupcakes). Even dark chocolate chips would be good too!",

I also added some brewer's yeast and vanilla because... why not? increased milk a bit... didn't measure... and I let mine sit overnight in the fridge too... maybe that's why they turned out so good.
