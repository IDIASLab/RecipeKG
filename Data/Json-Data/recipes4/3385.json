The only thing I changed was that I used about 1/4 cup of pickled jalepenos instead of fresh. I also used chicken breasts that were quite large and cut along the length into cutlets so they were quite thin. I marinaded for about 3 hours and they had lots of flavor. It was still spicy enough for my family who enjoys spicy food. I also doubled the marinade and boiled the leftovers down to use as a sauce over the chicken. Served it with brown short-grain rice and steamed veggies. Yummmy! Can't wait to make it again",
