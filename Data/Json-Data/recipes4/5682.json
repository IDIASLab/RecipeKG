I had whole chicken breasts and after marinating in the rub for an hour I wrapped them in aluminum foil and let them cook on the grill for about 30 minutes on low. Took them out of the foil and basted with the glaze. I didn't have mango puree so I used orange-mango juice along with a wee bit of fresh mango. This is a keeper!",
