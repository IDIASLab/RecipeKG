I did throw in a teaspoon each of garlic and onion powders, a healthy amount of fresh chives and some Frank's hot sauce. I did use fat free evaporated milk (I've had some disasters using refrigerated milk in the crockpot--I now use canned milk) and reduced fat cream cheese. This turned out very well and smells AMAZING. The cream cheese added a nice creamy flavor without going overboard. Next time, I think I'll cut the milk back by half to get a thicker soup.",
