But I think most people would find this amount of spice agreeable -- we just like a lot more spices. I did use cubed boneless pork chops in place of the spareribs (and was able to skip the chilling & fat-skimming steps because of that) but I don't think spare ribs would have added to my enjoyment since I don't like them anyway. I really liked cooking the cilantro in the soup -- I probably used more than 1/4 cup but whatever I did it really permeated the broth which was nice. Thank you for sharing your recipe I'm pretty sure I'll use this again. (This made 9.5 cups of soup for me.)",
