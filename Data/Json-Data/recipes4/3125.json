One criticism is that I have never cooked fresh squash before and it took me FOREVER to thinly slice it for the recipe. I later realized that if I had just cooked the squash in the oven for even ten or fifteen minutes this recipe would have been so much faster! Also I used butternut squash and acorn squash. The butternut worked better.",
