However I do recommend getting the spinach ready (thawing draining etc.) cooking/trimming the corn and cutting / saut\u00e9ing the zucchini BEFORE cooking the noodles. Otherwise the noodles get sticky and difficult to separate. (I used whole wheat noodles.) I also used much more ricotta than called for. Will make this again and again! Even my incredibly picky elder parents gobbled up every bite and wanted the recipe;-)",
