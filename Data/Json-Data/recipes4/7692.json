                "reviewBody": "Well. It's not a pizza, is it? What it is is a fun way to get the sort of flavors you would get on a peperoni pizza in a pasta casserole type of dish. Which is quite enjoyable, actually. The recipe provides a nice base for your own experiments. And I do suggest you experiment, otherwise the result might be quite bland (depending on the kind of marinara sauce you're using). I had to use regular pasta because kluski weren't available, but I can't imagine it makes too much of a difference.\nI added some chopped onions to the sauce, as well as some garlic, a splash of Worcestershire Sauce and some red pepper flakes to give it some zing. You may also want to add some salt and a pinch of sugar to the sauce. Will likely use fresh mushrooms instead of canned next time. I love using the slow cooker, but this would work just as well in the oven (which would probably give the cheese a nice crust). Overall it's comfort food for when you can't decide between pizza and pasta or if you find making lasagna too complicated. Tastes as you would expect it to; (literally) make of it what you will with your own variations.",

I think this could use even fewer noodles or more sauce. The ground beef was rather bland in an otherwise tasty dish so I would suggest seasoning the beef before you add it to the crockpot.  Regarding the cooking method.. next time I will just put it in the oven and bake for 30-40 minutes. I don't think the crockpot cooking added much to it",
