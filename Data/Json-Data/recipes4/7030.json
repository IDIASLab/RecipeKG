Original recipe requires 4 cups of shredded sharp white cheddar and 2 cups shredded mild cheddar. I know that's a lot of cheese but this is mac n cheese. There would be too much liquid if you didn't add the cheese they left out of the recipe or cut down on the liquid to accommodate for the reduced amount of cheese. Granted this is not the healthiest dish in the world but we can enjoy something like this from time to time. Try this dish with the full 6 cups cheese and I promise you wont be disappointed.",

To the sauce I did add a little hot sauce and a teaspoon each of garlic/onion powder. I happened to be out of Ritz crackers but I did have seasoned croutons--I ran them through the food processor for a rough chop and used them instead. I did not try this myself but the husband and kids liked it NO leftovers. I would make this again-- this was a cheap filling meal.",

I appreciate everyone who is kind enough to share their recipes, truly.  But I had half a box of macaroni and a ton of different cheeses in the refrigerator that I wanted to use.  Goodfella\u2019s recipe appealed to me because of the addition of tomatoes and chicken broth. I recommend reading her review.  I followed the amounts pretty much, but the cheeses were an amalgamation of different cheeses which I guarantee ended up as stringy, gooey, wonderfulness.  I made half the recipe and put them in individual serving bowls.   This is without a doubt one of the best mac and cheeses I\u2019ve made.  Thanks for sharing!",
