I'll have to leave out the clam juice and chicken bouillon then check with pH strips to determine whether to waterbath or pressure can (if marginal I can add citric acid) but I love to put up sauces like this in the summer for quick dinners the rest of the year. The only ingredient I see missing is garlic. Will update this review after I get a chance to put up a batch. Thanks for a fabulous idea!!!UPDATE: I have canned mega batches of this already and it's only mid-June! Added 2 T. of citric acid per 8 lb. of tomatoes. Processed in boiling waterbath for 70 minutes for pints. Used a pint the other night as a test run to make a Creole meatloaf...and it was FAR better than the original purchased product. You hit the nail on the head with this recipe!!!",

Maybe it's a natural attempt to sofen the tomato acidity but that flavor was off along with the orange wich had no place whatsoever here. The herbs which were all marked as optional and either a pinch or to taste are THE key flavors in this recipe and I had to bump them all up to 1T of oregano 1T of thyme and bisil. The base flavor was very weak also I added about 1t each of garlic and onion powder to help boost that up. The red pepper flake also necessary should be to taste because the red pepper you have on your shelf may differ from the one on mine. Mine was fresher and using the full measure given here it was very spicy. Just using another recipe would be easier in the end. Good luck to you.",
