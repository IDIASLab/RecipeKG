There's not much more I can add to nearly 100 fantastic reviews for these cupcakes about preparation or taste.  What I *would\" like to add, however, is that what this recipe is all about, what lovestohost has singlehandedly accomplished with her successful experiments, (I refer also to her other infamous cupcake and cake recipes) is to make baking fun and to create whimsical treats.  More than the finished product it's about the experience and the sheer joy you get from making these and her other recipes. Offhand, I can think of no other recipe with that distinction that is also so quick, easy, and that works for every baker, novice or skilled. These ARE a treat - for those baking them, for those who make these as a baking project with children, as well as for everybody eating them.  Great recipe(s) lovestohost.  It was a fun baking experience with a delightful result and I admire your creativity!",

I used a vanilla cake mix and the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting as recommended by others-these cupcakes are exceptionally good! I didn't want the brownie to stick to the bottom as someone mentioned so I put a dollop of cake mix on the bottom then a tablespoon of brownie batter followed by another dollop of cake mix-maybe it was just me but it seemed a little time consuming. Also I used a gas oven and maybe the cupcakes baked quicker but my brownie baked along with the cupcake so there was no 'gooey brownie' in the center. However I have not stopped eating them because they are so good! I used aluminum liners and my cupcakes did not stick and the peanut butter frosting is the best! I will definitely make these again!",

I used a yellow cake mix and the \"Baker's One Bowl Brownie\" recipe from this site....mmm...mmm...mmmm! I took the suggestion of one reviewer who said she chilled the brownie batter - makes all the difference in the world! You get the ooey-gooey \"almost\" cooked through batter inside! I also took the suggestion of placing a couple spoonfuls of batter in the bottom of each cupcake liner FIRST (made easier by placing batter in a measuring cup pours like a dream) THEN placing a scoop of chilled brownie batter and then pouring batter over top to 2/3rd's full...Baked for 20 minutes at 375F on CONVECTION....came out PERFECT!
