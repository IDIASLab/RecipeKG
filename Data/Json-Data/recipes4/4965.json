I skipped the whole mixing bowl part and just used 2 sheets of heavy duty foil - keeping the different colored beets separate. I drizzled the olive oil, thyme, and salt right onto the beet wedges and then enclosed the beets into foil packets, placed on a baking sheet and popped them in the oven. I rated only 4 stars because of the method.  I prefer to quarter the beets and roast them for longer (about an hour) instead of cubing them.  This way after they cool you can slice them for salads or cube them if desired.  Fantastic served with greens, goat cheese, toasted walnuts, and balsamic dressing.",

You can do things like that when you live alone...no husband asking where is the meat? Just beets and some crusty bread.",

I will definitely keep doing them this way. I might experiment with the seasonings just for fun but the thyme sea salt was very good.",
