Everything else was per the recipe. All of the spices blended beautifully, and even though I used liberal pinches of red pepper, it wasn't at all hot. It was just nicely seasoned, perfectly cooked and wonderfully crunchy. A definite winner, I'll make this spice blend part of my regular fish rotation. Thanks, crabbyjean!  Update: I've made this many times now, and have found that letting the fish rest for an hour in the fridge makes the coating stick even better. I make a big batch of the coating mix using gluten free panko crumbs, Italian seasoning and all the spices so I always have it handy. It's great for coating chicken, too. BTW - I now love fish!",

I did not have the roasted onions flakes, so I substituted with Mrs. Dash onion and herb seasoning, I also added 1tsp of parsley flakes. I the place the fish in the egg and milk mixture in a Tupperware bowl with a top and put in the refrigerator for 45 min. Then I put the dry ingredients in a plastic gallon size bag and put the fish in it and slightly shake the bag. I place the fish in a pan (spray pan with Pam) and drizzle the lemon and butter over it. Place pan in the refrigerator for 1 hour and place in oven for 35min on 325 or until golden brown. It was so tasty. This is going to be one of my favorite recipe for my favorite fish Tilapia.",
