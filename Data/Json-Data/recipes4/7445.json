The turkey sausage adds a great flavor and I incorporate as many vegetables as possible, but you can tweak it based on what you have in your refrigerator. I always add either spinach (usually frozen with water squeezed out) or kale, usually a red pepper, and I also like zucchini in this recipe and mushrooms. Don't usually do the broccoli, but if I do I cut it up fairly small, add when I add the carrots I cut them up into matchsticks, also add a can of no salt added tomatoes, which I don't think is in the original recipe. Since I usually don't have sour cream but always have plain low fat yogurt, I usually sub that. Still without those minor switches, this is a delicious crowd pleaser that is often requested by my kids and grandkids.",
