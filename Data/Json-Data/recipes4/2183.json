I even left the juice in the two cans of tomatoes and still found this extremely dry.  I took another reviewer's recommendation of adding a can of beef broth (low salt) and it was perfect.  I purchased a bag of frozen \"soup vegetables\" that already had the okra and potatoes in it.  Made it that much faster to make.  I can't wait to have some tomorrow since soup usually tastes better the second day.  Thanks for sharing!",

It all turned out quite good! 4 hours on low is probably good enough - I turned it to high for the last 2 hours because it took so long to hear up (what with the veggies being frozen and all) but in the end I would say my veggies and okra were over cooked so I would stick with the creator's cooking reccomendation. Great left over too - I took a small portiona and used some corn starch to thicken it up - also turned out good. Will make again!",
