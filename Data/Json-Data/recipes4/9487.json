It doesn't say to add it to the mixture and I didn't. Therefore it was very dry evn though I added the extra 1/2 cup of water. They were very hard after frying. What a shame to waste all that good wine and time. I guess I was supposed to add that oil. However I would think that would make it very wet as another person said. Afraid to ever try it again although I had fond memories of them. Wonder if I could have salvaged the dough by adding some oil after it was mixed. Oh well you win some and lose some.
