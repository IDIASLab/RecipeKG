                "reviewBody": "I had roast duckling for New Year's eve and I wanted to use the leftover duck. I chose this recipe as a base but I used a dutch oven and cooked it 1 hr at 450 and then 4 hrs at 300. Also I used the quick soak method for preparing the beans -- put them in boiling water shut off heat & leave them an hour or longer like 2 till they double in size. I read a lot about cassoulet which I'd never made before. Julia says the flavor of the liquid is the key. (Everything else especially beans absorbs it). So I used my duck carcass and two turkey thigh bones plus carrots celery & onion (studded w/ clove) to make a broth while the beans were soaking. My duck when fat cut off etc was only 5 oz so I used 2 turkey thighs skinned boned & cut up to make up. I used Kielbasa. I'm not sure I like the extra spice but my son did. Next time rather than just slicing I'd slice & half the slices so the spicey bites were smaller. I realized half way through that I didn't have anything for salad so I took out the very studded onion (odd that) and replaced it with cut up celery onion & 2 more carrots. I also increased to 2 tomatoes at end. I highly recommend making a broth of something & using it instead of water. You could use turkey chicken goose duck pheasant or whatever. The important thing is to be sure the broth is good since everything else takes on the flavor. Don't know how this would work in a slow cooker but mine got done in about 7 hours total.",

As other reviewers had stated it is a bit watery but I was not expecting miracles from my crockpot (its old and well loved). So I decided when finishing off with bread crumbs in the oven. I would put it in for about an hour at 325 then top with the breadcrumbs and stick the oven on broil to toast them up quickly. It worked out well. Next time I may try using goose breast and vension sausage (as my husband is a hunter so we have these lying around) and use tomato paste rather than a whole tomato. Lastly as other reviewers had mentioned a mixture of chicken and beef stock as well as red wine would make a nice broth instead of just water.",
