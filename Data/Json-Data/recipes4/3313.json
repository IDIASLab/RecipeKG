I actually made this the night before last as I wanted it to sit in the fridge for as long as possible before using. This. Is. MONEY. I used this in a BLT Sandwich Wrap for dinner last night and let me tell you it made the wrap incredible. I don't know why I haven't heard of this before but you bet that I'll make this frequently. This would be a wonderful addition to homemade ranch dressing or Secret Sauce. What a killer idea!",

I read how Roxanne was hoping for more carmalization on her onions so instead of just cutting them in half I cut them into thick slices and placed them on the cookie sheet with 3 cloves of garlic as well. I brushed on a little evoo and sprinkled w/ freshly ground black pepper and sea salt. Halfway through roasing I flipped them over and everything was nice and caramel colored. I also made this a day in advance to allow the flavors to blend better. This was sooooo delicious on our mushroom swiss burgers. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for posting.:) NOTE: This makes a wonderful dipping sauce for french fries and onion rings!!!",

The only problem I had is the fact that my onion didn't get a nice caramel colour all over but it had that wonderful smell and was very soft by the time 30 minutes had past. Only the edges seemed to get caramelized in looks. It smelled wonderful when I processed it but I should have left it to sit before using it for the flavours to meld better. I will make again maybe I'll cut the onion pieces smaller (so they'd have the caramelized look all over) cause I was hoping the mayo would have a nice colour from the onions. Thanks for sharing!",

Sprinkled with a bit of kosher salt fresh ground black pepper and EVOO. Added a couple of sprinkles of garlic powder at the end so it wouldn't burn. I only used 1 onion and added about 1/2 cup of mayo. It was plenty for us and there is some for leftovers. I would recommend to let the flavors mingle as the other reviewers do with the mayo overnight but it's also good right away. This is now our burger mayo! YUM!

I seasoned the onion slices (I used one large onion--the size of a fist) with a light sprinkling sea salt fresh ground pepper smoked sweet paprika and some garlic powder.The process was easier on the old electric bill this way too. The onions were sauted on a medium-low heat until nicely caramelized--about 25 minutes and then left to cool. I added the onions to 1/2 cup of mayo and blended in my blender and let sit in the container overnight in the refrigerator. The end result was a pretty light golden brown colored mayo and the taste was fantastic on the burgers I made for the family. I will make this again and keep some in a container in the fridge. This onion mayo would be good as a dip for baked potato wedges or on other types of sandwiches.",
