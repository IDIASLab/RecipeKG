Mine were just more crispy or crunchy, probably from the canola versus shortening they tend to use in the restaurants. The filling was delicious on these. The only changes I made was I used low-sodium soy sauces and left out the black pepper. I had thought to cook the filling before frying, but I am glad I didn't because it was fully cooked after the 4 minutes. I didn't realized how many wonton wrappers are actually in a pack! The package is now 12oz instead of 14oz like the recipe suggests. I got 50 appetizers and still have 1 1/2 cups left of filling left when I ran out! I guess I will use it for something else. Because the wrappers hold so much grease, I baked some of them at 375 for about 18 minutes. I lined a baking sheet with foil and sprayed it lightly with some olive oil, and then sprayed the wontons before baking. They tasted very good that way to.",

I also made a sauce using a 4 to 1 ration of kikkoman soy sauce to kikkoman teriyaki sauce 1 tsp minced ginger & 2-3tsp minced garlic which I heated almost to boiling on the stove (about 4 minutes on med-high heat). PERFECT dipping sauce! (you could add a pinch or two of sugar if you prefer the dipping sauce to be a little thicker--or you could use kikkoman teriyaki baste & glaze).

Secondly I added some Chinese cabbage to the veggie mixture and sauteed them just a few minutes. Lastly I would recommend NOT using a deep fryer. They seemed to IMMEDIATELY rise to the top. Some were willing to \"turn over\" but some were not so I had to leave the cover open and hold them down. Served with Teryaki veggies and dipped them in sweet and sour sauce (boyfriend used sweet chili sauce). Overall not bad but needs a bit more flavor - garlic perhaps?",
