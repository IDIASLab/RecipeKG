Finished the soup with a traditional splash of brandy.  I agreed with a previous reviewer that this does not really make six servings (unless you eat your soup from a custard cup).  I filled two french onion soup crocks and had just enough left over for a small lunch-size serving.  Also, it took over an hour for the onions to properly caramelize to a nutty brown color.  At the thirty minute mark, the onions had no color at all.  So give yourself a little extra time for this recipe.  You won't be sorry.",

My onions took about an hour to caramelize and I used chicken broth instead of beef broth because it was all I had on hand. It was a little on the tangy side. My french onion soup-obsessed boyfriend preferred it this way and thought it was a change I made 'on purpose'. I used a teeny bit less white wine and only 1 bay leave and added salt and pepper to the onions as they were caramelizing. I also buttered the bread and sprinkled it with garlic powder before toasting in the oven. I'll definitely make this one again!!",
