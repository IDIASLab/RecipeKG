I made some modifications\u2026used a can of tomatoes, 1/2 can diced green chiles, used 1/4 tsp. powdered ginger, added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne, and left out the coriander because I didn't have any. This recipe only took me maybe 15 minutes to make because of the canned ingredients (oh, the canned tomatoes made it so that I didn't have to add water at the end). This tasted wonderful! I go to Indian restaurants often and it definitely rivaled the chana masala I've had there. My husband also loved it. There was enough sauce that I probably could have added another can of chickpeas and it would have still been fine. Thank you for the great recipe!",

The overcooking must have released a bitter component (from the onion, garlic or ginger). I like the idea of using the blender instead of chopping and grating, but next time would follow the direction to saute for only a few minutes and ignore the direction to saute until golden brown or until the oil separates. Doing the latter two ruined the dish.",

It was very easy, I had my 13 year old daughter make it, and it came out pretty good. We skipped the green chile and bay leaf, we didn't have any in the house. It is very savory, and very mild tasting- not one spice overpowering the dish. I used 2 cups of organic dry garbanzo beans, which I soak all day, then boil for about an hour. They were nice and tender, and from that point the preparation of the dish is very quick. Looking forward to eating over some brown rice tomorrow.",

I had no garam masala; so I found a recipe here on All Recipes and used it. That made the recipe a little more time-consuming. Basically I heated the olive oil in a pan and added the onions and then remembered the bay leaf...then I prepared as indicated adding fresh tomatoes garlic ginger pepper flakes and the garam masala. Then I added in some chickpeas in their juice I had previously made and served it over jasmine rice. Important note at first it was bitter however when I added the tumeric it toned it down. Next time I will increase my tomatoes or used canned. Also as it was very spicy with the chili I will add in carrots or sweet potatoes. Thanks for sharing this lovely dish.",
