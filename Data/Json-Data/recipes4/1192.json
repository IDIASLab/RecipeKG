The second time I made this recipe I followed it exactly.  I found that I ended up with way too much liquid.  So instead of reducing down all that liquid I made a delicious risotto out of the extra liquid.  It was easy.  I sauteed some garlic in a pan, added the risotto rice to the pan and then continued to add the liquid until the risotto was done.  I finished it off with some grated parm.  The liquid that remained in the lamb dish was then reduced down to the perfect amount.  I love this dish because I always have leftover red wine that I don't know what to do with.  This dish is perfect for using up all that red wine that I hate to throw away.",

Lamb shanks aren't easy to get hold of in the UK but it's well worth the effort of trying to do so - not least because of this particular recipe. I have done it about five times so far for dinner parties - including once for a Masterclass chef who thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not a very good cook but this works so well that people seem to think I CAN cook! I'm writing this review now because I have guests for dinner tonight and I'm doing it again. I can smell it cooking right now and I've just been thinking that I don't actually want to share the contents of the pot with anyone! I want to eat it all by myself because it is soooo good. Thank you to S. Hodge who gave us this recipe - it's much appreciated. People think I can cook because of it!",

I had 2 nice Shanks plus 2 nice thick bone in shoulder steaks. I pretty much went by the recipe but used org beef broth only, fire roasted tomatoes, 2-3 Tbs tom paste, 3 c of Shiraz, LOTS of garlic, carrots, onions...and folded lots of fresh rosemary/thyme into a coffee filter package I made and tied...bouquet garni. I put it into (covered) a 400 oven lowered to 350 and left it about 3 hours. PERFECTION! And by doing it in the oven you get a beautiful reduction. Thick flavorful sauce ....delicious!!! No need to thicken..does it for you! I made small red potatoes steamed and tossed in lemon, butter, garlic and parsley to go with...YUMMMMY!!!! Thanks for an easy and foolproof recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "There's nothing terribly wrong with the recipe, but on the whole it was a little thin and boring.  I halved the lamb and kept the veggies the same, and it still didn't have enough substance.  For braised meats, I've never felt that side dishes should be a necessity, but they are in this cause since you have a lot of thin sauce and very few veggies--overall, I felt it should've been more stew-like.  My suggestions are to double the carrots, add a turnip or two, a rutabega, and two potatoes.  It'll be a much heartier dish.  I would also replace the chicken broth with beef only, doubling the amount and halving the wine (since the wine is just flavour, it is wasteful to use a whole bottle).  Another addition might be to add a dark beer (a porter, perhaps) instead of the wine.",
