I actually added two tablespoons of bacon grease to the skillet with the butter when I sauteed the onion as well as a good amount of fresh minced garlic. I sprinkled the potatoes with Johnny's Seasoning Salt instead of plain salt. The boys flipped over these home fries. I served them with \"Egg Flipped Over\" and homemade vanilla-glazed chocolate doughnuts. The great thing about home fries is a) they're really hard to mess up, b) they almost always make for a heartier breakfast, which is key when you're feeding a husband and two growing boys and c) you can totally make them personal to your family.",
