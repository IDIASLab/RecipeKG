I put the carrots in the oven (which was set at 250 degrees) for the last 2 hours of baking the chicken.  Thank you FrackFamily5 for sharing your recipe!  We really had a FrackFamily5 dinner that was very yummy!!",

Since my carrots were already very sweet, I used about half the honey, and I also sprinkled a little sherry vinegar over the mixture...just a few drops.  I roasted them at 400 degrees on a baking sheet covered in parchment paper for 30 minutes or so then turned the heat to 425 for another few minutes.  They were lightly browned and delicious!  I do think that 350 is a bit too low for cooking if you want them browned, so take note of your temp if you want them caramelized.  And don't crowd them too much.  Cooked this way, I loved these, and I'm already planning to head back to the store within the next day or so for more carrots!",
