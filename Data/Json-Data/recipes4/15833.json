I only had chicken leg quarters so I browned them in the butter/oil mixture after I clarified the butter (so it would be less likely to burn.)  then I removed them to finish cooking in the oven.  When I saut\u00e9ed my veggies I added the remains of the clarified butter.  I also added a splash of chicken broth that I had in my refrigerator.   After the chicken was cooked I cut it up and let it sit for a bit in the sauce.    The taste was fabulous!   This is a new staple for me!",
