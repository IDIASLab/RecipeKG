I scaled the recipe down to 10 servings, left out the onions, and used home made cheddar cheese sauce.  Had I used velveeta or cheese wiz it probably would have been inedible at my house, but for those who like processed cheese you would probably like the recipe as is.  The only thing that would make it better is some buttered bread crumbs on top (they make all casseroles better!)",

I really was lazy and felt the potatoes would cook in the oven without pre-boiling, so I just cut them into small bite sized pieces, greased the pan real good, mixed everything up and threw it all in the pan. I cooked them for 60 minutes covered at 350. I did take them out halfway and stir them so they wouldn't burn on the bottom. They were cooked just right, fork tender, without pre-boiling.   I do think they needed some more seasoning, the only reason for 4 stars. We do like Velveeta and I'll try them again with some, but if you're not a fan of processed cheese this recipe works fine without it.",

I've yet to bring one bite home. Buy a aluminum foil roasting pan, with a lid and you won't be left with dirty dishes.  I do suggest baking it on top of a cookie sheet so the pan doesn't buckle when you take it out of the oven.  It's delicious, absolutely delicious.  Just don't cut corners on the bacon or cheese.  I would suggest doubling the chives, they really bring out the flavor.",
