I would not rate this a very \"special\" meal...more of an \"everyday\" dish.\n I served it with pasta and a green salad and a week later my family requested that I make it again.This time I served it with mashed potatos and fresh green beans.  This is a versatile dish and easy to make. Since my family liked it so much I think I will get several pounds of ground beef and make the patties up and store them in the freezer so they are available for a quick but easy meal.  Thanks Jennifer this will make the summer meal planning a little easier.",

No way did this taste like ketchup after it has simmered! The meatballs were really flavorful too! Make sure you add enough onion chunks because that's what make this gravy so good. My husband added hot sauce on his plate because he likes everything hot. I didn't make it with noodles tho I just made them as is and had some veggies and made some biscuits and it was wonderful! I will definatly make this again!",

To overcome this we cut the ketchup to 1/4 cup in the meat mixture and added a beaten egg. If you are alergic to eggs.... add 1 tablespoon all purpose flour instead... and go back to the 1/2 cup ketchup. We also added garlic powder which enhanced the flavor even more. YUMMMMMMM.",

I made them pretty small so maybe that helped.. I didnt think that the gravy or the meatballs tasted like ketchup at all. The trick must be in adding a large onion and really simmering it. (Even though I didnt eat the chunks of onion.) We didnt think it tasted like sloppy joes or meatloaf at all either. Myself my husband and my 3 year old really liked it. He said \"yummy yummy mommy\". Also we didnt serve them over noodles just by themselves with side dishes of mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. We all agreed that it would probably be gross if it were to be served over noodles. Anyways I think you should give it a try!",
