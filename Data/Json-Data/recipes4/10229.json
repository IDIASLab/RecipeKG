The dough is basically the same although they put sugar in the dough. When we make bread a 10 pound bag of flour is used and we make about 150 loaves. I notice that people are having difficulty with the pockets forming. We divide the dough into balls cover and let rise again. We then roll on a floured board (using cracked wheat) pretty thin. Using this method you should have very few fail to rise.",
