I used Michigan brand cottage cheese (dark blue tub) as it has a very low amount of moisture in it and it has small curds. I also added white pepper and sea salt in the mix. I boiled them and then cooked them in a frying pan with a little butter to give them a crispy coating that my family loves. I got 19 out of the batch I made.",

I beat lightly together 1/4 cup of water one egg and brush this onto my dough before filling and sealing. This helps to keep the perogies sealed. I highly recommend buying a HunkieBill's Perogy maker (originated in Winnipeg). This wonderful kitchen gadget makes 18 perogies in 5 easy steps. 1.Roll out dough and place on perogie maker. 2.Fill pockets. 3. Roll out another dough and place on top. 4.Press together and cut with rolling pin. 5. Remove excess dough and tap finished perogies from perogy maker! You can order one online.",

After reading another review I made this batch half boiled and half pan fried to test it out. It's true the boiled ones turned to soup and were edible but not that tasty. The fried ones are amazing though! I added pepper italian seasonings and parmesan cheese to the filling and panfried them in olive oil for a few minutes. They broke but still turned out really wonderfully. Pan-frying in olive oil made them really crispy and fluffy but not too oily. They still had a little floury feel on the outside too. I highly recommend frying instead of boiling. I've never had perogies before! Thanks so much for this recipe!",

My Ukranian mother-in-law made wonderful perogies but after boiling and draining them she would top them with boiled whipping cream that had fresh dill sliced onion and salt and pepper incorporated! This is an additional extra flavor enhancement and delicious (and I don't even like dill!)",
