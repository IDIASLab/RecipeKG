Change out to boneless skinless thighs to solve this problem.  And no, the increase in fat doesn't change the recipe much at all.\n2-Cooking everything that long makes the flavors muted and homogeneous.  I suggest reserving half of the basil, oregano and garlic for the last 45 mins of cooking and a splash (1 tsp) lime juice or vinegar to brighten the flavors.  It's not that much more of a hassle to do so for a significantly better outcome.",

Served over spaghetti w/ a sprinkle of Parmesan, it was a hearty and easy meal, and one that I would prepare again; however, I would be more mindful of the time.",

Salt and peppered the chicken, dusted in flour, and browned in olive oil and butter.  Then cooked the onions, mushrooms, (red bell) pepper, and garlic until softened before adding in the sauce ingredients.  Threw in the chicken and cooked for about 40 minutes more.  Good stuff!",
