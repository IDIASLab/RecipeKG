My husband was a little skeptical of meatless enchiladas because I make amazing authentic (as far as I know...) enchiladas. Even he loved them and requested I make them again when we have company next week! The only thing I changed was adding a mexican spice mix I keep handy and making an extra half batch of the cheese sauce because the amount this recipe makes did not cover the enchiladas and we prefer them soft not crispy. Overall though they were amazing!!!! Thanks:)",
