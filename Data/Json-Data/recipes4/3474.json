I add several more garlic cloves, peppercorns, and use lobster tails I get at Sam's for under $20. It's really not that spendy--this recipe actually makes about 8 entree-sized servings. I just use equal sized amounts of the cheeses--usually about 6 oz. portions, grated. I never use a whole lb. of macaroni--a half pound is plenty. This is good even if you omit the lobster. Try adding diced ham instead, or leaving out meat altogether. I also like it with a little heat--use some cayenne or a couple of tsp red pepper flakes--or just serve with your choice of hot sauce.",

The execution of the recipe is unnecessarily complicated, for one thing - it should have been nearly as basic and straightforward as \u201cwhile pasta is cooking make the white sauce \u2013 melt the butter, add the flour.  Stir in the milk, cook until thickened. Add the cheese off heat. Mix in all remaining ingredients. Top with buttered bread crumbs.  Bake until sauce is bubbly and crumbs are lightly golden.\u201d  Simple as that.  Also, I found the additions of garlic, shallot and onion distractions rather than contributions.  Further, it wasn\u2019t creamy enough \u2013 I found I had to add nearly twice as much milk as the recipe directed.  Finally, I felt the Panko bread crumbs needed to be tossed with a bit of melted butter.  Overly elaborate in both technique and ingredients.  I did like the combination of cheeses, but this could have been as easy as simply making macaroni and cheese with a variety of cheeses and stirring in some lobster.",

Instead of elbow macaroni I used linguine. For cheeses I used an 8 oz. bag of mixed Mexican-style cheeses & some parmesan. No need to brown the roux 10 minutes nor strain the milk. I did not let the sauce thicken too much as it continues to thicken when it bakes. I browned the panko crumbs in 1 tsp olive oil. Also I baked the casserole about 25 minutes until it was good & bubbly and starting to brown around the edges. Good recipe very adaptable.",
