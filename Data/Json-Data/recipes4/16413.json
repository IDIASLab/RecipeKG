Just needs more than one cup kale, cuz it shrinks so much.\" I never thought that I'd dive into a side dish w/ as much glee as I did this one, but WOW. I'd recently (finally) finished off a monster amount of Costco's frozen bags of quinoa/kale blend, and didn't want to stuff more of them in my freezer and found this recipe instead. And I am thrilled that I did b/c it is delicious! I've since made it 3 more times, once subbing spinach for kale (just as good), once adding toasted sesame seeds (not necessary, but a nice touch), and all the more recent times, at least doubling the greens b/c they shrink down too much in the heat and we love green chow in our house. A superb, healthy side dish, and ohhhh when I run it through the food-processor a few times, my baby CHOWS DOWN! :-)",

We are trying to replace rice with whole grains like quinoa, and I wanted a dish that incorporated some greens as well to round out the nutritional balance. I had about a tsp of leftover diced onion and half of a diced tomato- added those in with the kale and garlic. This recipe made the perfect amount for two people. Will be making this often.",
