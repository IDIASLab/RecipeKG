I wanted a extra sauce so I used 3 chicken breasts but kept the other ingredients the same as written.  After cooking the chicken in the slow cooker, I rolled it in 10-10 inch tortillas, placed them in a casserole dish, poured the additional sauce over top, covered with foil, and baked at 375 for about 40 mins.  Next time though I need to remember to save some of the sauce to the side before shredding the chicken and adding it back to the crockpot.  We love cumin, probably my favorite spice, so I enjoyed the flavor and did not find it too overwhelming.  Will definitely make again.",
