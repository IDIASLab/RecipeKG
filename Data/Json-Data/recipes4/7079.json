These are pretty good meatballs, and not very hard to put together.  I rolled them by hand then poked my finger into them to make a little hole to drop the feta in and then pinched the meat back together and gave another quick roll to round the meatball back out.  It made 24 good sized meatballs.  Would also be great with some marinara sauce and provolone on subs as the feta isn't too overwhelming.  I served them with broiled zucchini spears and was a great low carb dinner.",
