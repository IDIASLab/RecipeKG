I decided to try it. I used 50% less fat Land of Lakes Margarine to cut down on the fat. It takes a 3 quart or 9 x 13 in casserole dish which isn't stated in the recipe. I decided to give this a try thinking I would regret it but not only didn't I regret it I LOVED IT.  It's fast, easy and it does not have a processed taste which I expected.  I warned everyone ahead of time that it might not be great but it was an easy meal.  Everyone said \"what do you mean it's not great we love it\". I have to agree.  If you're looking for a relatively fast easy meal that's tasty this one is one you might want too consider. No processed taste at all.  It was done in an hour and only prep time really was cutting up the chicken breast. Only change I made was to add some Her*box chicken seasoning (which I think is the best) to the mix.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Most recipes call for the chicken to be cooked prior to baking but this one didn't and I wasn't sure about it but after an hour I pulled a chicken bit out of the center and temperature checked it and it was done. My family really liked this and I will definitely be making this again and again.  It's easy and tasty. If you are in need of a fast and tasty meal this one fits the bill.",

This was a great simple recipe base , very tasty.\nThank you for sharing. I will make it again and again.",

I layer the rice on the bottom, then the chicken and then I melt the half stick of butter and mix it in with the rest of the ingredients and pour all of that on top.  Then I sprinkle a thick layer of parmesan cheese on top.  This is my go-to recipe when I bring someone a meal and people always say they love it.",

The bacon added great flavor. This is a good recipe as is and a great base to make your own adjustments to.",

I followed the recipe but customized it a little by adding 1/4 tsp each of basil, rosemary, and thyme and 1 tsp of garlic powder and 3 tsp chicken bouillon,   since I had no broth. I also cut the butter in half because I was concerned it would be much too much. Like some of the other reviewers, I sprinkled about 1 cup of cheddar on top. The cheese and butter created the most delicious crust! I was impressed. :)\n\nThanks for the recipe! I will definitely be making this again.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention I used regular long-grain white rice, not instant, if that matters. =)",

I cut the chicken into 1\" cubes and placed them in a 9\" x 13\" Pyrex dish. I combined the 2 cups of Uncle Ben's rice (not instant) with 2 cans cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom, and a 14 oz can of chicken broth. Poured this over the chicken cubes; dotted the top with slices of margarine (one stick), and about 3/4 C. Panko crumbs. Baked it at 400 covered for 30 minutes, then uncovered for another 25 minutes. This is excellent, comfort food at its best! \n(and the heck with all the haters just b/c I changed a couple things)\nThanks to katie, the original submitter, for a KEEPER!
