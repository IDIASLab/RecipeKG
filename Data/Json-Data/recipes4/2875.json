The chicken was very tender cooking time was right on. After reading the reviews I chose to cut the puff pastry in half. I then rolled it out with a rolling pin since someone else said it was hard to get the pastry around the chicken. After I rolled it the pastry fit very well around the chicken and I sealed up the edges with some warm water to make it stick. All the flavors work well together. I will definetly make this again.",

Instead of leaving the chicken breasts in halves I've dice it so it's easier to eat when served.  I also use cheddar/mozerella cheese blend instead of the feta simply based on preference.  (I think any cheese would work!)  Adding bacon and/or mushrooms is also an easy way to change it up!  ",

To make sure the breasts cooked completely through I pounded them smaller. I did use a whole sheet of pastry and that truthfully made the dish even better to me. Never having used puff pastry before my first one broke completely apart on the seams (felt like a big dummy) but my second one I ran a rolling pin over the seams until they meshed completely and the result was simply gorgeous.
