I was hesitant at first to use all the garlic but it worked out great. Because of my timing of preparing this I mixed up the spread put most of it on the bird and then refrigerated it. When I got ready to bake it I took it from the fridge but didn't really let it come to room temperature. The downside of this was that it took a little longer to bake than if I'd have followed the directions exactly. I did save off a couple tablespoons of the butter spread to baste it after taking off the foil. Moist tender and yummy! I don't know how much butter you actually ingest because there was a lot in the bottom of the pan but I didn't really worry about that. Very yummy!",

I can only review because I followed this recipe to the letter. My husband told me to make chicken the way I usually do. The seasonings are over the top for this little bird.
