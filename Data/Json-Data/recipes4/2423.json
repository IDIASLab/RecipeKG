I put my chicken in the marinade overnight and add some fresh cracked pepper and some garlic powder (not salt as you don't want it too salty). I also like to add a little brown sugar to sweeten it and some crushed red pepper for a little heat. This is really a great entree that is quick and my children really enjoy it. I have also cut the chicken into chunks and cooked them then speared them with a toothpick and served with some peanut satay sauce on the side for a really quick and filling appetizer.",
