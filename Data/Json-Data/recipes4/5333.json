I did tweak a bit (= I thought I had a can of diced green chilies - but instead had a large bag in the freezer - which I didn't want to mess with to use 2 tbsp. I used cilantro jalape\u00f1o tortillas and added sriracha and chopped cabbage that I needed to use up. I layered cheese beef cabbage cheese sriracha between the tortillas. Next time I would add a layer of glue cheese between the beef and cabbage. I liked the crunch the cabbage added. The sriracha worked well since I didn't have available diced green chilies.
