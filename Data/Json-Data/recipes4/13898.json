The only modification I made to this recipe was to add an additional 4 Tbls water as I could not get my dough to form without. I just pulled it out of the oven and my husband and I both enjoyed a slice.  Great flavor and not too dense.  Next time I am going to try using just vitamin C and omit at least some of the wheat gluten.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe for healthy bread!",
