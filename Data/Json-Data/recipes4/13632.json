                "reviewBody": "FOLLOW RECIPE EXACTLY FOR TODDLERS/PRESCHOOLERS.  I listened to the reviewers who added more flour to get the \"right\" consistency. If you add much more flour you'll have tough modeling clay. You want something really pliable and soft for little fingers. This recipe leaves you with the perfect consistency dough. Your child can build shapes and mold but very easily.  I used three cups of flour and had to add about a tablespoon and a half more oil and about 1/4 cup more water to get it where I wanted it (probably back at the original recipe's result).  Be sure to stick this in the freezer for a few minutes while you clean up from making it since it's far too hot for little ones to play with right away due to the boiling water you added. One reviewer mentioned she used food coloring. OMG!! I think that would stain clothes and fingers! Don't do that! The idea behind the coolaid is that it gives you the color and a nice scent without the stain factor of food coloring. Besides, food coloring is way more expensive.  I was able to get 10 packets of coolaid from my local discount store for a buck -- and I had a 50 cent off coupon for ten packs (so I paid 50 cents). Oh - and when this recipe says \"edible\" she means this isn't the name brand stuff made in China with whatever they use.  You know that if your kid eats this homemade stuff, you don't have to worry. This is not a replacement for your kid's afternoon snack!! Sheesh...",

I omitted the kool-aid and then split a half batch into 4 balls and made different colors with food coloring.  I'd say a half batch made the equivalent of 4 store bought playdough containers, so a full batch would make 8 containers....lots of playdough!  Excellent recipe and we'll be making this lots.  Make sure to mix the oil in really well before adding the water...i used my fingers to crumble it and it turned out great!",
