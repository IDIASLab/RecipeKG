I added some finely chopped green onions and used only half of ONE can crab meat for a stronger cream-cheese taste.  Some people also commented that the filling was too mushy and fell apart in the oil.  You can avoid this by squeezing out all the water in the crabmeat before adding to the cream cheese mixture (also results in less crabby taste).  And when you moisten the wonton wrapper edges with water, you get a tight seal.  None of mine fell apart in the oil...  I tried various different folds and liked the triangular fold the best.  This is pretty darn close to restaurant-quality!",

To cut down on a few of the calories I used Neufchatel instead of cream cheese (basically cream cheese but with a third of the fat). I also used spring roll wrappers instead of wontons - mostly because they were easier to roll up than to pinch all those wontons. I used imitation crab and onlt used about 6 to 8 ounces. I recommend chopping up the green onions garlic and whatever else you add finely. Makes it a creamier texture.",
