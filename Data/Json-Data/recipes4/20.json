I also used a little over a cup of Bob's Vegetable Soup mix a dried soup containing the alpha pasta barley and assorted dried beans. Cook time for Vege II and Bob's were approx the same. I still added frozen green beans and a can of corn but had to add extra V-8 to thin to soup texture. Bob's thickened more than expected. Altogether an excellent soup. Next time I'll double recipe and put some in freezer in pint freezer bags for a quick soup for one or more people.",
