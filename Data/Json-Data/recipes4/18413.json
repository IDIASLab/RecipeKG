Since I have a variety of eaters in my family from vegan to carnivores I love it when I find something they all like and will eat. I usually make it in a stock pot on the stove with homemade veggie broth and add different veggies depending on what I have on hand. It s also delicious with a few chopped tomatoes thrown in. This is the kind of recipe you can change up a lot with chicken or beef broth/meat but I like this veggie version. It s light and healthy tasting while still very satisfying. I serve it with the perfect accompaniment...a big loaf of hot crusty chiabatta or sourdough bread. Delicious!",

But after changing up a few things such as adding a couple more different veggies seasoning using fewer potatoes etc this is definitely a comfort food. It turned out really well and of course with a crockpot you can throw everything in and walk away. No having to stand over the stove when you have other things to do. But it can be cooked on the stove if you don't have a crockpot also. I made a loaf of homemade white bread (in the bread machine I had a busy day so all of this was a perfect time saver) and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I'll be making this again! But for true potato soup I'll stick to my own original recipe that I've been using for over 30 years.",
