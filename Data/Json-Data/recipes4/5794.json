I had never heard of someone roasting cucumbers, and a quick internet search turned up nothing, so I thought it would make an interesting culinary experiment. As it turned out, though, I discovered a new family favorite! This fast and easy recipe makes a great side dish for any occasion. Great with chicken or steak! I've even eaten it by itself for a light lunch. What more could you ask for?",

I didn't have olive oil spray so I brushed olive oil on the pan and used coconut oil spray on top of everything. I feel like the fresh herbs lost most of their flavor being in the oven so long so next time I might add them when I turn everything. Also needs a bit of salt not a lot. Thanks for making up this unique recipe and sharing with us!",

I also froze cucumbers for a sweet/sour pork recipe so I was looking for something different. I didn't have a Vidalia onion so just used a yellow one plus one green onion. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly including all the fresh herbs. All of the herbs were great and the cilantro was a must. Delicious. I'll be making this again!",

This recipe removes much of the water that is causing them to become mushy. As a matter of fact you can saut\u00e9 on the stovetop to get the same effect. Since I know their source I leave the nutritious skins on which considerably ups the greenage. Just keep them cackling and steaming. As they begin to get limp and as they move from bright green to dull turn them off cool and freeze. If we don't eat them as a veg this winter they will Jazz up soup after a quick buzz in the blender.
