I enjoy using left-over teriyaki chicken in my fried rice, but you can use any meat you want or no meat at all! With or without chicken it is equally as delicious and a great side dish! You can use more or less garlic, depending on your personal preference.",

This was very good. Both me and my boyfriend thought it tasted exactly like the restaurant hibachi chicken and rice. It was ten times better. I cooked this with frozen spring rolls from the grocery store. I almost feel like cooking this again tomorrow because I don't have leftovers. The only thing that I would change is to use soy sauce according to your own desired taste. I decided to do this and it was perfect. I think if I used what the recipe called for it would have been too much. Try it you will not be disappointed.",

                "reviewBody": "I use this recipe as a base.  I always add 1 medium onion, about a cup of frozen peas, usually 2 zucchini, and a can of water chestnuts.  I start with cooking the onion for about 5 minutes on medium, then add the garlic(which I always double, we love garlic) and zucchini.  After a couple minutes, I line the pan with all the veggies that I have cooked, making room in the center to cook the eggs.  I add 1 T. of butter in the center for cooking the eggs.  That little bit of butter adds another layer of flavor to the recipe.  Once the eggs are done I add the rice, rest of the veggies, and soy sauce(4 to 6 Tablespoons).  Before serving I also add salt and pepper to taste and about 1 teaspoon of sesame oil to it all and mix well.  My son doesn't like the texture of sesame seeds.  The sesame oil gives the taste of the seeds without the texture of them.  Every time I make this everyone raves about how it's better than take out and just as good if not better than the hibachi restaurant.  I hope this helps others.  When it comes to cooking recipes, I love experimenting!  BTW, I cooked the chicken separate.  My son is autistic.  I've learned to cook certain ways so he will eat everything.  And chicken on the side and not mixed in is another thing that helps him.  Enjoy!!",
