I think you could get 8 servings if served in sandwiches or over spaghetti out of 2 lbs of ground meat. I used ground turkey and added more Worcestershire b/c I think it helps 'beef' up the flavor when using ground turkey in recipes calling for beef (I find it makes turkey less noticeable to the usual beef-eaters). I made the meatballs a bit smaller than directed and they were perfectly cooked after 15 minutes. Good balance of the onion garlic and spices. Thank you!",

They were about 3\" and after cooking were still about 2 1/2\" sized meatballs. Mine needed to cook 35 min. be flipped and then have another 20 minutes more. I cut the onion kind of small worried they wouldn't cook in time but with the extra minutes that helped. They were good with best marinara sauce yet. I plan to try them with a gravy to. 2 are filling to me especially if eaten with something else.",
