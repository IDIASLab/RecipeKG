I, however, do season my turkey wings my own way since I don't have the poultry seasoning (season salt, basil, chili powder, onion powder, white ground pepper, and granulated garlic). I also never have canned cream of anything in my pantry so I do make my own simple substitute:\n\nHomemade Cream of \"Something\" Base:\n\n2 tablespoons butter\n3 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n1/2 cup low sodium chicken broth\n1/2 cup low-fat or fat free milk\nsalt and pepper to taste (or chicken bouillon)\n\nMelt butter. Stir in flour; keep stirring until smooth and bubbly. Remove from heat and add the chicken broth and milk, a little at a time, stirring to keep smooth until it thickens.\n\nHope this helps!",
