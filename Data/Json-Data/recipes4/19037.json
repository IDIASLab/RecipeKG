I personally cut the onions really small (more of a mince than a chop) and I prefer to saut\u00e9 them before adding them to the ground beef. Make sure you season with an ample amount of salt and pepper, if you don\u2019t the filling will be bland. My favorite dipping sauce to serve with these is sour cream mixed with a splash or two of white vinegar (sometimes I add dill weed too).  They freeze great, just make sure to flour them before putting them in the freezer. I didn\u2019t do this the first time and they all stuck together. Banging them on the counter to separate them was a workout LOL.",
