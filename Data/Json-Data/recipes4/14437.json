Your addition of cinnamon sticks and a bay leaf is a very clever 'addition' and I like it a lot. The 'cinnamon' stick is a bit more subtle than grated cinnamon and the bay leaf is gently aromatic. The basmati rice is such a flavorful rice to start with that too much of anything would be overkill. This combo of sweet pungent combined with the somewhat flowery basmati rice....just is a delightful merging. Lovely recipe and quite enticing to the palate!!!",
