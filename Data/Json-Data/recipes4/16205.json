I really love this dish because it is so simple to make, yet it tastes fabulous. It freezes well, so when you have time on your hands, you can make a couple up and freeze them. Then when you are harried or just plain tired, just pop it in the oven and have a wonderful meal. It is also well within anyone's budget. Some like it better the second time around. Any kind of salad goes well with it.",

The one negative thing I am going to say is that 2 pounds of cheese is overkill if you are at all concerned about your calorie and sodium intake. With that being said, use your own leftover homemade chili as I did and you will be reducing some of that sodium. I used venison instead of beef in my chili so made mine a little leaner too. I did like the addition of olives. This is something I have never had in a frito pie. Tasty but I recommend keeping your portions small.",
