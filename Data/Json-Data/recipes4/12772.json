I decreased the amount of fish sauce to 2 tablespoons to be safe and I didn't think it came out tasting like fish at all -- and I hate fish so I'm very sensitive to fish taste. My husband who loves fish did think it tasted fishy but he liked the dish. The only problem with it was that after simmering on medium for about 15 minutes the beans still weren't tender. Next time I'll cover the pan while simmering so they'll steam more and get soft.",
