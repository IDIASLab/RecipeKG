The flavor was intensified without any added heat. Got compliments from even my mother in law, who pretty much hates all my food, so that's saying something! I dont ever add the water it calls for.",

Normally I'm not a big fan of shortcutting recipes by using powder mixes and such but I happily make an exception for this one because the flavor is so amazing. You can't even tell that mixes were involved! I've served this at 3 barbecue dinner gatherings and people always ask \"What's in this burger? The flavor is so good.\" When I tell them it's just water soup mix and dressing mix they are shocked. It's moist flavorful and when you add a slice of cheese and some crisp bacon on top it's absolutely decadent. Follow the recipe exactly for best results!",
