The cabbage blends in with the rice so that even your kids won't know they are eating a vegetable. My husband likes to eat this for a late dinner because it's so light. Be creative or use whatever is in your fridge. Like it Spicy? Add some chili sauce. This dish goes great with baked spring rolls!",

I skipped the onions too since the kids don't like them. I did use onion powder fresh garlic shredded carrot 3 cups of cabbage and about 6 slices of bacon which I saved the fat to fry with the rice. (I know not so lite now) I don't like Chinese 5 Spice so I added salt pepper and some hot sauce; soy sauce on the side for those who wanted it!:)",
