One batch I fried as the recipe stated, and the other I just baked as another reviewer suggested. Just baking until the meatballs  was easier and I could not tell the difference between the two batches.  Also, if your going to go to this much work to make meatballs, don't use jarred marinara sauce, make your own from one the many recipes found on this site. Much better.

First batch I didn\u2019t re-read the directions before hand and just put everything in one bowl and mixed together.  Then realized I was supposed to cook the onions and mix the eggs and spices in a food processor.  Oh well too late.  The second batch I did as instructed and cooked the onion and processed the eggs and spices and then mixed with the cheese etc.  I didn\u2019t fry either batch.  I just put them both straight into the oven.  I noticed barely any difference between the way they came out.  Gave BF a taste of each one.  He said the ones that were made as instructed were barely slightly better.  SOOOO.... if you\u2019re looking to save time I would say you could really just put everything in one bowl, mix it together and make the meatballs w/o frying first.  Anyways.... this is the only way I will ever make meatballs again. They are beyond fantastic!!!",
