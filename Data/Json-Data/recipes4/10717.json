Only problem with this is that there's WAY too much rosemary. Also there must be a misprint because there's NO WAY you can make this with 8 cups of water. My Dutch oven only allowed me to put in 3 and that was more than enough. To compensate for the overwhelming flavor of rosemary - because that's all we could taste - we added more crushed tomatoes and beef broth. Next time I made it I will use only a taste of rosemary. But it was simple and very flavorful. Thanks.",
