I used Healthy Harvest whole wheat egg noodles, which I slightly undercooked. Instead of chicken bullion (which I was out of), I used beef bullion.  I also added 2 tsps of dill and instead of the hot sauce, I used 2 tsps of hot paprika.  I sauted the onions and mushrooms, then heated the ingredients through and put it in a cassarole dish.  I baked it for 25 minutes at 350.  It came out great!  Next time I am going to replace the water with either sherry or marsala (not the cooking kind, blech!). My husband loved this.",

Had a few crispy noodles around the edges but the pasta wasn't mushy. Also instead of the can of soup I used Homemade Cream-Style Soup Mix from this site. This would be a great recipe for a dinner party when you don't want to worry about all your dishes at the last minute:) And I would definitely serve this one to guests. Thanks for a great recipe!",
