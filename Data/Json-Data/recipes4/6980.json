Husband and I really loved it other than that. Going shopping tonight and going to get ingredients to make it again! Very easy and yummy! I did add a tiny bit of Tony's seasoning to the meat while I was browning it, but thats all I did differently. Definitely recommend this! I ate leftovers of it, even though it was dry. Normally I dont eat leftovers but it was just THAT good! lol",
