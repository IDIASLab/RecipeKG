I removed chicken and sauteed my onions and garlic with a little white wine deglaze. Instead of water I used chicken broth and also added one can diced tomatoes and one can of tomato paste. After I returned my chicken to my dutch oven I finished off the dish in the oven at 325 for about 2 hours (adding 1 cup uncooked orzo during the last 30 minutes). Plate and top with crumbled feta and some fresh diced basil. YUM!!!!",

Having tasted the mixture before serving and finding it pretty bland I added about 1 tsp dried oregano about 1/2 tsp dried mint about 1/2 tsp chili flakes a good shake of spicy herbamare which is a spicy salt mixture-probably not really needed. I let the dish simmer for a few extra minutes at this point. I also minced 3 more cloves of garlic and added just before serving. I had used one standard (about 375mls) can of plain tomato sauce about half a can of water then added about 3/4 cup of long grain rice as I did not have orzo on hand. Also next time I make this I will certainly take the skin off of the chicken either after browning or before starting the recipe. So I did change the recipe quite a bit and of course this is only due to personal taste but I do appreciate having the chance to try it out. We will be making it again as it is a relatively fast meal. Thank you for posting this dimitra.",
