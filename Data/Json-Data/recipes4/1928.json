I didn't have sherry so I used a splash of white cooking wine. I baked it in the oven since it's raining out and it did take longer than one hour. In fact it took almost 2. I added several more ice cubes since several said there was not quite enough broth. Other than that the recipe was not altered. The provolone was very tasty but what a mess. It stuck to the bowl the knife and fork when I cut up the onion in my bowl and then the spoon. I just had a nice hearty slice of toasted nine grain bread from the bakery and all in all it was a great and satifying meal. My husband will be home late and when he does he'll get a bowl and maybe I'll return and write his review. Thanks for the recipe! I'll definitely make this one again.",
