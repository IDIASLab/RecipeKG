The only thing that I did (since I had 2.6 lbs of catfish filets) was add an egg to the skim milk and about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to the breading.  I will keep making this recipe again and again since my husband really loves seafood (and I hate frying fish).  A few words of caution, though - after the fish is finished baking, serve it immediately.  I let it sit for about 40 minutes in a warm oven (husband was late coming for dinner) and the bottoms became soggy when they were perfectly crisp after just being done.  Secondly, my filets were huge (4 filets equaled 2.6 lbs) and I had tons of breading and eggwash left over.  Afterwards I realized that cutting the fish into smaller strips/pieces would have solved that problem by creating more surface area for the eggwash and breading and would have made smaller, even crisper pieces of fish!
