I used smaller yellow potatoes (a little bigger than an extra large egg) and set them for 6 minutes in my Instant Pot. They were still a little hard in the middle after the suggested amount of time. I put them back in the pressure cooker for another 4 minutes and they seemed perfect. Next time I will let them cook for 9 0r 10 minutes before quick release. I think it's just the difference between pots that made for this discrepancy.",

The second time I increased the apple cider vinegar to 2 tsp and added about 1.5 Tbsp Maggi to the dressing ingredients and included a finely chopped baby dill pickle too. My husband and son both agreed that it was the best potato salad they have ever had! Definitely a keeper. (I used the Whole Egg Mayonnaise also found on this site and it is wonderful in this recipe.)",

I set the potatoes in a steamer basket inside my pot and I cooked them for the 3 minutes recommended and natural pressure released for 7 minutes. They were not quite done so I pressured for 1 more minute quick release. Perfect. It all depends on the size of your potatoes. For the onion hater in the house I used onion powder and followed the rest of the recipe as is leaving all measurements as written. Although I only had a small taste test I really liked this recipe. The amount of dressing was perfect for the amount of potatoes and I enjoyed the addition of dill. I used to boil my potatoes whole for potato salad but I actually prefer the pressure cooker method. Definitely a keeper in my book!",
