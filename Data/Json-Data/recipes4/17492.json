When boiling the sugar water I added some grated rind from the grapefruit and some honey (which probably wasn t a great idea the honey flavor was a little overpowering). But overall it was delicious and I m sure the recipe is great with no changes. Also I don t have an ice cream maker so I blended it in a blender froze it until solid blended it again and froze it again and it turned out fine so it can even be made easily without an ice cream maker",
