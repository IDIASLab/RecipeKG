The fresh herbs and marinara add layers of flavor, and the croutons (mine were garlic & butter) and freshly-grated parmesan are the perfect topping.  This soup has the bold and rich flavor that you get with homemade tomato soup when tomatoes are at their peak.  Do allow it to simmer the 15 mins listed in the directions, as the flavors do intensify.  Trust me, nobody will ever know that this soup wasn\u2019t made from scratch (no need to tell them, either) because it doesn\u2019t taste like you started with a can of tomato soup.  Honestly, the quality of this soup surprised me.  Thanks lainalee for sharing your recipe, this was a very nice lunch today.",
