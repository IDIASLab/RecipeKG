I also mixed the turkey and soup in a separate bowl and then spooned it into the pie shell. I pressed the turkey down to make plenty of room for the veggies. The gravy thickened nicely (I used walmart brand gravy packs ) and then topped with potatoes I had thawed out from a huge batch weeks prior. I did raise the rack in my oven and broiled the top for 5 mins before pulling it out....wanted a little more crisp on the top. once the pie sat for about 15 mins it was very easy to serve and still hot inside!!",
