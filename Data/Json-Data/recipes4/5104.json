It turned into a happy accident BTW I also tossed a handful of fresh basil leaves while layering cuz my basil plants are shivering and threatening to turn. In spite of my changes, this was excellent. Very velvety and yummy. Sparky gave it a very big thumbs up too. Assemble the ingredients and keep them chilled early in the day and quickly layer and you have dinner on the table in 30 minutes.Nice enough to serve to company too. Crisp chardonnay, crusty bread and a romaine wedge balances this nicely. Thanks so much for sharing this K-Dub. Excellent!",

Also added a layer of homemade pesto in the middle, and that was an awesome addition. I loved the flavors/richness of this dish and the fact that you can add whatever you like and come out with a simple, yet tasty meal. Made this a bit ahead of time and just baked it when I was ready, and that worked out well. I servd this w/ a salad and garlic bread. A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I had a couple of packages of the refrigerated chicken and cheese ravioli and approx. 1/2 of a container of the alfredo sauce that is sold with the pasta. I added that alfredo to a jar of mushroom alfredo from the pantry and it was perfect. Using the 2 packages of pasta the top layer was 1 or 2 ravioli short but it wasn't noticed. I sauted some onion and a little garlic with the chicken seasoned well and backed the Italian seasoning down to 1 TBS. Perfect for our taste and received many compliments. Thanks for sharing K-Dub! We will enjoy this often.",

I used spinach and cheese ravioli and forgot to put the parmesan on so I just added it once the pasta was served. I used a little less mozzarella to save some fat but I think I also used a smaller package of ravioli so it worked out to a good amount of cheeseyness anyway. Excellent recipe K-Dub!",

I opted to use tortallini as we had recently had ravioli for dinner. I used Classico Lite Asiago Romano Alfredo Sauce - very yummy. Topped with pecorino romano.
