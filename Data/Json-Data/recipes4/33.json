The first time this was made we used a generic Japanese brand salsa that has no bite (live in Japan). The second time we used an American salsa that gave the dish more of a sweet sour taste. Depending on your tastes simple to fiddle with the salsa to tweak the flavour.",

                "reviewBody": "My husband was more enthusiastic about this than anything I've made in a long time. I was determined to make the cornmeal work and I believe the solution is to make sure your oil is very hot when you first add the coated meat and not to turn it until there is a good golden color to the down side. Continue to turn and brown the meat until all sides are browned. This gives a crisp coating that won't fall off and get mushy as some reviewers have complained about. I used medium salsa but think it would be better with hot. I also added the whole can of beans and don't think it was too much. (And besides what was I going to do with half a can of black beans?) Initially I added a little more beer bean liquid and peach syrup but as it continued to cook and thicken I just periodically added a little water. The pork was wonderfully tender and the combination of flavors was unusual and good.",

If I made this again I would do without the cornmeal and just quickly brown the pork and let it simmer in the sauce. Also the peaches gave it a nice flavor but I'm not big on pork/peaches. Might forgo the peaches too. The beans salsa and beer were an excellent idea though.",
