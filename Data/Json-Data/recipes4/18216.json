        "description": "This vegan cheese tastes like cheese and has a strong cheese aftertaste. The glutinous flour creates the firm and slightly chewy texture of melted cheese. The flax seeds creates its slimy quality. The cheese will always stay melted and will not harden. The top of the cheese can dry and solidify if toasted. It can be used for macaroni and cheese, fondue, toasts, pasta sauce, lasagna, burgers, sandwiches, cheese fries. You can put the mixture in a piping bag and squeeze it over the top of pizza to form random streaks of cheese over the toppings.",

I added a bit extra nutritional yeast because my chickpea flour gave it a slight bitter taste. The extra yeast toned that down. I served it with tortillas for a vegan version of chips and queso.

It ended up just looking and tasting like gravy. I made a bunch of changes to it and ended up making it edible. Added almond milk lemon juice some cayenne powder garlic powder extra nutritional yeast and then even melted store bought vegan cheese into it. Tastes somewhat like cheese now but also tastes like an almond dip.",

I specifically use sunflower oil, and I add taco seasoning mix to make it taste like taco cheese. Make sure your keeping your pan on low or slightly higher heat, and get a highly fine ground flour, pastry flour is great for things like this as well. Please don't diss the recipe, it could be a coarse flour you used. You may try blending the flour first in a magic bullet or similar before adding to the pan. Great recipe!!",
