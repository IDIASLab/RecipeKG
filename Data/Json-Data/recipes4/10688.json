A more accurate name would be \"Four Pepper Lasagna.\" Next time I make this, I'm going to add more onions and more spices to the sauce such as salt, pepper, oregano, and basil, as well as more red pepper flakes than what the recipe states, and/or Italian seasoned diced tomatoes. I was also surprised that the recipe didn't call for garlic so next time I'll add a couple cloves. I think these changes will give it the depth of flavor that it needs.",

                "reviewBody": "I use this particular recipe as my base anytime I make Veg. Lasagna and it always turns out great. The kick from the red pepper flakes perfectly compliments the cheese and veggies. my only problem with the exact recipe is it has a lot of juice in the bottom of the pan when made to these exact directions that I just drain out the corner of the pan a little. I eyeball the amount of peppers use zucchini spinach and sometimes carrots. I also do not use the tomato paste and water. I sometimes just saut\u00e9 the onions garlic and peppers leaving out the tomatoes. It still turns out great with a little less juice its also a great base recipe for spinach lasagna. If you want softer zucchini saut\u00e9 it with the peppers. So my overall suggested changes would be as follows: Saute onions garlic peppers and zucchini use your favorite spaghetti sauce in place of the pepper mixture mentioned here. Layer the mixture and maybe add in spinach if you like. This makes for a more flavorful lasagna as the original as others have mentioned is more like 4 pepper lasagna. The more red pepper flakes you add the spicier it will be if your finding it is not spicy enough for you add more.",

From making others like this I've learned that unless you bulk it up some with other veggies it just isn't that filling. I also make it a bit healthier by using low fat cottage cheese instead of Ricotta. With the peppers and onions I add in broccoli mushrooms and spinach(frozen). Put in as much as you want. I follow the directions as written for the sauce but keep in mind it will not look very sauce like with the extra veggies. No worries though use it like the recipe suggests it still works great and tastes even better. I add extra red pepper flakes to the cottage cheese mix and only use one egg. I can't imagine using 4 eggs. I also sprinkled the mozzarella on after putting on the cottage cheese mix. I know I've listed a lot of changes but it really is worth playing around with to make it your own.",

(The site forces you to \"rate\" if you \"review.\")  Instead of the sauce described, I sauteed a chopped onion, green pepper, and red pepper and then simmered them with a jar of store-bought tomato and basil spaghetti sauce for about half an hour.  I also used low-fat cottage cheese instead of ricotta, which both made the lasagna healthier and gave it a firmer texture.  I've also learned, by trial and error, that the key to successful lasagna is letting it set for 15 or 20 minutes after taking it out of the oven; otherwise it's just a gooey mess.  The idea of a pepper-based sauce was excellent--it gave the lasagna the texture it needed without making it too vegetable laden--both the meat-eaters and the vegetarians at my party really enjoyed it.",
