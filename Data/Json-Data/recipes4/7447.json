I already had all the ingredients on hand so it made it pretty simple. I made no changes except to use green peppers and hollowed out \"zucchini boats\" instead of red peppers. I also doubled the recipe because I wanted left overs for work the next day. This was absolutely delicious! I had to cook the quinoa mixture a little longer than called for to get all the liquid to asorb (I did rinse the quinoa thoroughly in cold water to avoid the bitterness) but honestly this was really good. This is a very healthy and flavorful meal and even my picky kids ate plenty. This is a keeper - perfect for garden season!",
