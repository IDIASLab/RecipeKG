I am, and I thought this sage-butter sauce was perfect with it. I didn't measure seasonings exactly, just to my own taste.  What I'd love to try next time is to subtley brown the butter and use fresh sage. Great dish, however, just as is, keeping mind that seasoning measurements are useful as a guide, but don't have to be strictly adhered to!",

I tripled the recipe and followed it exactly, except that I poured the sauce into a bowl with the gnocchi and tossed it because I had too much gnocchi for the pan.  I've only had gnocchi with regular spaghetti sauce before and did not care for it, but I LOVED this!  Great with a salad and garlic bread.  Thanks for sharing!\nP.S.  I used freshly minced garlic and I think that really adds a lot of flavor",
