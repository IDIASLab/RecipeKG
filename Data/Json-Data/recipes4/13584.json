We call it 'song soup' because of the line 'parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme' from the Simon and Garfunkle song 'Scarborough Fair.'  You can change it up by using noodles instead of rice, or add extra veggies instead of a starch.  I've also made this with leg quarters instead of white meat, or if you have a lot of people to feed you can double this and use a whole chicken, cut up. Serve with garlic cheese bread and a green salad.",

For someone who's battling a pretty nasty strain of the flu I appreciate all the help I can get making something fast that will help me feel better. I had two large chicken breasts just hanging around that I'd poached in chicken broth that I didn't end up using as well as cooked brown rice that was leftover from another meal earlier in the week. I did add more veg(about a half cup of thinly sliced cabbage and more carrots and celery) and I used the chicken broth from poaching the chicken(plus a bit more)for the soup. This will feed me well for a lowfat lunch for a couple days at least and it's flavorful enough where I don't feel like I'm depriving myself of anything. This is so quick it should be illegal and for those of you who have a little of this and that from the week's meals can throw it in and make it work to feed the whole family on the cheap without wasting leftovers. Way to rock it Ladyslew!",
