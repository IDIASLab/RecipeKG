In my opinion exactly how homemade bread ought to be.",

My only changes were to use butter instead of margarine, increased the honey to 1/3 cup and I did need extra flour but it's super humid in KC.  Made three big loaves, one of which was gone within a couple of hours.  Used my kitchen aide to do the kneading with the bread hook for 10mins.  For those who said the bread didn't rise well, you might want to alter to steps and proof your yeast with the warm water separately, then add the rest of your ingredients. Also kneading thoroughly makes for better crumb and structure.",

Did 1/2 cup milled flaxseed and only 1 1/2 cup (Bread) flour. Fantastic flavor! Will be great with tonights soup!",
