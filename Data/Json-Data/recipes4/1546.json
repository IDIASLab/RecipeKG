A couple of things: I used that lemon pepper shake that you can buy for seafood rather than the Italian seasoning which I thought would clash with the sesame. Worked wonderfully. Also, I sprinkled toasted sesame seeds on the top. Be careful not to overcook and you've got a 5 star recipe!",

I used fresh herbs (oregano basil and parsley) and dried rosemary (but not much). I put everything in a dish when I was making the marinade then transferred it all to a ziplock bag and put in the refrigerator. I made sure all pieces of fish were coated with the marinade and turned it (the bag) and massaged the fish every 30 minutes for an hour and a half - this was to make sure every peice was good and coated with all of the herbs and spices. Then I took the fish out of the refrigerator brushed all of the excess marinade (from inside the bag) onto the fish with a basting brush and enclosed all of the fish in an aluminum foil \"tent\" and put it in a glass baking dish. The fish fell apart when it was done (about 40 minutes at 345- 350) and the juices were inside the foil bag with the fish. I WILL DEFINATELY MAKE THIS AGAIN! BRAVO to the creator of this recipe!",
