Unfortunately for me, the low carb didn't mean much because I went back for a second huge bowl so still had way too many calories. If you like Jambalaya, you will love this. I didn't have any shrimp so had to omit them ( Did not want to go to go to the store). Also, I had no Cajun spice so I made my own using a recipe from this site. That too was really good. This is a keeper. My husband loved it too. I will use this in future even for a non low carb and will use this recipe but just add rice to the pan (brown or white) and let it cook while it's simmering. This is in my recipe box and I will definitely use it again and again. Thank you Malory.",

                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe twice. Once as listed above and a second batch with which I tried to obtain a more traditional type of Jambalaya flavoring. The method as written is good, but doesn't really give it that La type of flavoring.\n\nThe trick in doing so is first to preferably obviously use a real jambalaya pot. If you don't have one, at least use a cast iron dutch oven or similar. It will make a difference.\n\nI also varied it by using the method used here in La of browning a few rashers of bacon first in the pot and using the grease as the oil to brown the vegetables and chicken in instead of olive oil and butter. And do this over medium-high heat. To give it the more brown look I also used the normal method here of splashing in 1 TBS of Worcestershire sauce after browning along with about 1 tsp of brown sugar. It made a good variation this way.\n\nI'd also offer the suggestion for those on a low carb diet for diabetic reasons that they add some navy beans or similar to absorb the liquid's flavor. Pre-soaked and partially cooked and then added to the pot after adding the broth will allow the beans to absorb the liquid and retain even more of the flavor. If you're on a low carb diet for other reasons (e.g. weight loss) then avoid the beans until you're well along in your diet as even if they do have a low net carb content, it isn't as beneficial for you as it is for those who are diabetic and for who the beans will lower their insulin requirement.",
