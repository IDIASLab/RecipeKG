I made no other changes in ingredients and none in terms of measurements or in the cooking method. That makes this easy - it's perfect just as is. The spinach was a creative addition and the Muenster lent just enough but not too much flavor. Exquisite.",

The sauce was perfect in 10 minutes, and the bake time is perfect also. I was a bit skeptical when I poured the sauce over the potatoes and spinach because I didn't think it was enough, but I was so wrong, this recipe is perfect as written. Next time I'm going to use Swiss cheese and add some crumbled bacon, now that sounds wonderful as well! I agree with Christina, I believe many types of cheeses could be used in this with great results. Thanks for the recipe :)",

Instead of using 1 cup milk and 1 cup heavy cream I just used 2 cups of milk and that worked out perfectly. These were truely delicious and I will be making them again and again!

Because of the high fat content as written I use olive oil instead of butter and 2% milk instead of heavy cream. And since all I ve had on hand were russet potatoes that s what I ve used. I also leave out the salt as the cheese has plenty and my husband has high blood pressure. As for the cheese I can say that I have made it with many types and mixes and that the Muenster is definitely the best! This is now our favorite potato recipe and although I m sure it would taste much richer as written the basic recipe idea is excellent and still a treat with all the cheese!",

The sauce doesn't seem like it's going to be enough for all the potatoes (I used 4 big Russets) but it is enough once the spinach shrinks in the oven:) Thanks for the recipe!",

I did change a couple things to go with what I had on hand. Yukon golds frozen chopped spinach and Jarlsberg cheese. For the amount of potatoes I cubed them fairly small and put a generous single layer across the bottom of my 9x 13 dish. Thawed and drained the spinach pulled out little chunks and placed evenly over the potatoes. When I added the milk and cream I did it in a few batches instead of all at once and had no problem with clumping. Other than as mentioned I followed the directions for cooking and such. Take the time to caramelize the onions I don't think these would taste nearly as good with just regualr onions. It was a little futzy having to make the cheese sauce but the quality of product makes it so worth it. I think that the next time I will add some cubed ham and make a bit more sauce to make a one dish dinner. My husband said \"bacon bacon bacon\" that would be good too! I so wish I had taken a picture before it was all gone.",

I couldn't get shredded muenster so I had to buy a 1.11 pound block which worked fine for the two cups. The block cost 8.09 which is too pricey for the results. The cooking directions and times were right on the mark though and my dad just loved them. I love the idea so I will try a different cheese next time because the Muenster was just too mild.
