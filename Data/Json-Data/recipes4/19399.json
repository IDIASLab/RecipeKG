If you are the kind of cook who aggressively salts the water when cooking potatoes, you may want to be careful about how much salt you add to the water in this recipe--you'll be adding that potato cooking water to the meat mixture which already has a good amount of salt in it thanks to the spice mix.  \nThis was such a hit, I'm making 4 more to freeze to enjoy during the holidays.

Do not substitute from the kosher salt, used sea salt once and it didn't come out as it should have. I always used the Pillsbury ready crusts, time saver and just as good.",

Added 2 large onions chopped to the meat mixture, which I covered with water and boiled for 20 minutes until all meat and onions were cooked. I then strain the meat and liquid. I put the liquid in the fridge so the fat comes to the top, I then scrape the fat off and thicken the liquid (make a gravy). I add the meat to the pie shell and then add the gravy to the pie, enough to make it wet but not runny, I did not use potatoes.. I really only used the spices and then made my pie the way my mother taught me. I am Canadian and love meat pie. I make my own crust with Tenderflake lard. Delicious. I may put them in tart shells.
