Here's what I did: used a \"pudding in the mix\" cake mix chilled the dough for about an hour rolled the dough in granulated sugar and didn't flatten them as the recipe said. They turned out very chewy/soft and the granulated sugar gave them an ever-so-slight crispiness. They also have slightly strong molasses and spice taste so be warned if that's not your thing.

Maybe they got crisp for the others because they mixed them with a mixer and incororated too much air into them.? I did not flatten them slightly like the recipe said but i followed the rest of it exactly. Very easy nice cookie!! Update: Chewier and better flavor the next day. Thanks for the recipe!

I was really impressed-- they turned out better than I expected! The first batch was on a standard cookie sheet with olive oil spray and I wound up baking it for 10mins then letting it sit on the sheet for another five or so. The second batch was done on a silicon sheet sitting on a regular cookie sheet no oil so I gave it a few extra minutes in the oven and I also let it sit on the sheet for about 10-15. Both batches turned out good! I also made the cookies smaller in general so I came out with 22 cookies instead of 10. Love the recipe. It's light and tasty! My only concern is how quickly the cookies could dry out which is a problem I've had with other recipes in the past...we'll see!",

I made 17 cookies total but they all ended up flat. They'd make good ice cream sandwiches though. They are chewy and taste good but they don't look so great. Maybe my baking soda was too old? This is the same recipe as Giant Spice Cookies submitted by Sandra Pyeatt though hers uses 1/4 C molasses instead of 1/3 C. Next time I would use 1/3 C as I think the reason the cookies spread so much was because of all the liquid. I will try them again sometime as it's so easy and they're pretty decent. Not fabulous though. I sprinkled some granulated sugar on top of most of them before baking.",
