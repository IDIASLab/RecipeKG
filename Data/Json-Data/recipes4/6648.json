The results are creamy, cheesylicious cauliflower that you might even get your picky eaters to try.\nHere are the changes I made, just to give you an idea of what can be done. I had a huge head of cauliflower (purchased for $1 at produce stand) and 3 smallish heads of broccoli veronica. Seemed like I needed more cheese sauce as a result, so I increased the sauce by 1/2 (3 Tbsp Butter, 3 Tbsp flour, 1 and 1/2 c. of milk, etc.) I had only scallions so I chopped up 1 and 1/2 c. of them. I had only 1/2 c. sharp cheddar so I subbed in colbyjack (obviously used more of that as well.) I love nutmeg in my cream sauce so I tripled the pinch of nutmeg and ground some fresh black pepper in there (definitely more than a few pinches.) This recipe is fairly low sodium, a little too low sodium for my tastes so I added about 1/2 tsp sea salt. \nSo I followed the steps for the white sauce and kept the proportions except for seasoning, followed the cooking instructions including steaming until veggies were tender and baked it off with extra cheese on top. It was beautiful, tasted wonderful, and I got no complaints at all from the 18 year old, 12 year old, 98 year old, hubby or myself. \n\n(Do you know how rare it is to find a recipe they all like? lol, good job Amy W.)",

I am a low carb eater, so I used half and half (instead of milk and flour), to hold the dish together.  Then added a pinch of salt, since there was none in the recipe, and it was perfect. The onion adds a really nice dimension to the dish. I would not omit it unless you hate onion.  Loved this and will make it again soon.",
