Cut back on the paprika too. 3 TBS is a bit much. 1 - 2 TBS is better. Use 2 (15 oz) cans diced tomatoes and 1 (15 oz) can tomato sauce vs the 2 cans tomato sauce and 1 can tomato paste. The goulash will thicken once you add the macaroni. Add a TBS of yellow mustard to the hamburger while browning and a TBS of white sugar after you add the tomatoes.",
