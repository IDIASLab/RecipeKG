To eliminate the problem several reviewers mentioned of the sauce burning in the bottom of the baking dish, I put it in a separate bowl and dipped the chicken in that.  I used a tablespoon each of regular soy sauce and low-sodium teriyaki sauce, and added a shake or two of garlic powder to that.  I didn't use salt or pepper in the flour/sesame seed mixture.  When I basted the chicken about halfway through baking, I DID add a couple of shakes of the teriyaki sauce to the pan, mixed it with the butter and spooned that over the chicken.  I baked this for 30 minutes only and it was perfectly done, and the sauce didn't have time to burn since I added it halfway through.  Yummy!",

I used this recipe as my basic guide and did the following: 1.Marinated small pieces ofboneless chicken breasts in a combo of soy, teriyaki, and thick maple syrup. 2.Coated the chicken pieces with the flour, pepper, sesame seed mixturs. 3.Browned the chicken pieces in a little sesame oil. 4.Added more soy, teriyaki, sesame seeds and maple syrup to the frying pan and cooked slowly until the chicken was done and the sauce was nice and thick and sticky. My husband and I loved this and thought it was very close to chinese restaurant sesame chicken.",

I served it with carrot rice (also found on this site) and green peas - great combination! Thanks for the recipe!",

Add some duck sauce or sweet-and-sour sauce (about 1/3 amount of soy sauce) to increase the taste. Sesame seeds can be purchased toasted from the Oriental food market. If there are none in your area toast on the stove in the frying pan but STIR CONSTANTLY; once the seeds start changing yellowish switch the heat off under the pan but KEEP STIRRING - the pan will hold enough heat to finish toasting.",

The mixture was NOT enough to coat maybe even 4 breasts..by the third I had to scrounge of every last bit. I constantly had to add flour and other ingedients to make it through. You also needed to add more soy sauce to the bottom of the pan. It was a bit dry the funny thing is my dad liked it and I did not! Overall I think that I will possibly try it again and will definately add more things to it. This is a good \"mess with\" recipe...and that is all that it is good for at this point. Suggestion: Try some slices of green pepper on top...do not make this recipe the way that it is noted...you may not like it as well...definatley double even triple on the ingredients!!!",
