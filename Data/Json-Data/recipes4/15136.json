I did reduce the rosemary to just 1 tbsp - I think 3 tbsps is quite a lot - rosemary is very strong. I think if I made this again I would replace the rosemary with thyme. I did not care for the red pepper flakes in the spinach. Next time I would cook the spinach in the olive oil with the garlic. I would leave out the red pepper and the chicken broth. Thanks for a great new sandwich idea.",
