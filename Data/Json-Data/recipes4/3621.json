These \"sammies\" simply lack flavor even with the balsamic vinegar using leftover marinated flank steak from the previous day and sprinkling a sm.amt. of salt to the filling. Another issue was having most of the filling falling out when trying to eat the sandwich. Perhaps wrapping the sandwich in foil and heating the fresh mozzarella would go a long way to keeping the ingredients together. Using arugula in place of the spinach which has a slight peppery bite may enhance the otherwise lacking in flavor of the sandwich. To sum it up the original preparation left me \"under-whelmed\".",
