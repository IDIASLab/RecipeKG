These peppers were sooo easy and everyone loved them.  I bought a container of the small sweet peppers (about 10 red/orange/yellow), for those who don't like hot, and also did 10 small jalapeno peppers, and between the two, I had exactly the right amount of pork/cheese filling. Couldn't find the cheese it called for so I used a block of cream cheese.  It was nice because I had hot peppers for those that liked the bite, but also the small sweet peppers for those who did not.  One of the best recipes I have gotten off this site.. am making again for a get together on Boxing day.  Try it.. you'll like it!!  Just a side note.. made these again, and added a little bit of chopped red & green sweet pepper into the sausage mix for some colour in the filling. I am making (by request) again for my daughter's engagement party!  Great recipe!!",

I made 30 and they were gone in 10 minutes. Next time I will have to make more. I also wanted to point out that I didn't melt the cheese, I just added it to the well drained sausage at room temp and and mix with a spoon until smooth. I baked them at 375 for 25 minutes and they came out toasty brown from the parmesan cheese that I used to top them. As I was leaving the party I was overwhelmed with compliments. ",
