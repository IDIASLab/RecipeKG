I added garlic because I couldn't see how just onions and seasoning salt could give much flavor and I was right. The chops were perfect for the applesauce my family was craving but I think it could use a bit more flavor. I think adding onion soup as a previous reviewer stated would definitely give this the flavor I was craving. Thank you for the recipe we will definitely be using the cooking method in the future we will just be changing the seasonings. Update My husband told me these were the best. He gave them 4.5 stars so I updated my rating. The leftovers absorb all the \"gravy\" and the flavor comes through more. Who knew pork chops could taste better the next day?",

I like to use 3/4\" or larger bone-in. The recipe calls for season salt which is fine but add your own garlic seasonings or whatever your taste buds conjure - I don't think you can screw it up. If you do use the dried onion soup as a seasoning use only a tsp or two maybe with a little poultry seasoning (it works well here). But do not skimp on the real onions - vidalia are my favorite for this recipe. And guess what? At the end of the 1-1/2 hours if you are not ready just turn the oven off and leave them there; they will be even better after they rest. And don't bother making gravy out of the liquid - just pour it on as is.",

If not add enough oil to just cover the bottom of the skillet and flash fry the chops over high heat until they are brown on both sides but not cooked thru. Next I place them in a baking dish cover them with onions you decide how many just insure each pork chop has some add about 2 to 3 tablespoons of water or chicken broth cover and cook 30 to 45 minutes until tender and succulent. My family calls these \"Mama's Pork Chops.\" Try them they are super easy really flavorful and very very tender and succulent not dry. I bake them at 350.",
