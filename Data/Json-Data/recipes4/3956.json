I used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts with total weight of 1.7 pounds.  Needed about double the corn flakes called for.  One other hint...be sure to really mix corn flake, onion soup combo...the onion soup wants to go to bottom of bowl and you end up having much more of it on the last pieces of chicken dipped than the first.",

I'm a little confused about the time because since I used tenderloins I thought the time would be less but, (I was using a convection oven)  I had to cook them 25 min.  but that said  it was the best receipe I've tried on this site.
