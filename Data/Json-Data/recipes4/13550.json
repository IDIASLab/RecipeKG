Boil this down to a thin syrup, strain, and serve drizzled on top of the sliced breasts or as a dipping sauce.\n\nYou can vary the ingredients of the marinade.  I left out the rosemary, used miren instead of water, added dry mustard and a splash of Worcestershire.",

I marinated 5 hours then seared the outside of the breasts and transfered to a baking dish and poured some of the marinade ontop. Baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes ( I baked 2 breasts). I let the meat rest for about 5 minutes and then sliced and put over salad with 1/2 baked sweet potato. Leftover marinade I poured into a small sauce pan reduced over med heat. Was great for dipping and whisking with olive oil as a salad dressing and drizzled ontop of everything. YUM! Hubby loved it and I will def. be making this again! oh yeah the cayenne MAY be a little too much for some. If you are sensitive to any \"after\" heat you may want to reduce cayenne.",

Let marinate overnight, and cooked at 350 for about 30-35 minutes.  The chicken was wonderfully moist, and so tasty.  My bf remarked he could taste many different flavors in the chicken as well.
