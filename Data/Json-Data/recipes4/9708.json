The sausage flavors the broth more than enough without the additional spices. Since my family doesn't care for a lot of chuncky tomato, I substituted 1 large can of crushed tomatoes for 1 can of stewed tomatoes. The flavor and consistency of the broth was perfect. The one thing I plan on trying the next time I make this is to replace the rotini noodles with cheese filled tortilini noodles. I think this would be a great variation on an already great soup.",

That's usually everything I'm looking for on a fall evening after work. To suit my own tastes I threw in a brick of frozen spinach along with the sausage and onions and let that cook in as well -- added to appearance nutrition and flavor.",

I love salami but it just did not work in this recipe. I also added about 1 cup of shredded cheese to give it a bit of a creaminess. at the table I had parm cheese and mozz cheese for people to sprinkle on their soup.
