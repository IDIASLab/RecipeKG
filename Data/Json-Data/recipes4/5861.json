The flavor from both the garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce were soooo strong and seemed to fight each other. I made them on Halloween (tradition) and instead of a treat I got a trick! Maybe it's just my tastebuds but they were so bad I threw away all the seeds. Next time I'll stick to my old favorite of toasted with butter and salt. Sorry!",

Although I only added three teaspoons of salt they turned out so super salty I could barely eat them! I like the Worcestershire sauce and garlic but I will definitely add only one teaspoon of salt to the doubled recipe next time. I added a bit of black pepper before baking and a bit of finely grated Parmesan cheese towards the end which gave them good flavor.",
