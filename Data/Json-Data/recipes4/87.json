I only wished I had read some of the previous comments prior to cooking this dish because then it would have been even better.  I agree with others: the broccoli needs to be precooked first, cut down on the amount of onion (I say this even though I'm an onion lover), and put more of the cheese in the casserole instead of on top.  I also agree that this dish needs to be cooked a little longer - about 10 more minutes. Even though there was a little room for improvement, this dish was AWESOME!",

I got a pound of American cheese and shredded it adding it into the broccoli mixture rather than putting it on top. I also used 1/2 cup of Italian breadcrumbs and 1/2 cup of crushed Ritz crackers mixed with 6 tbls of melted butter for a yummy topping. Rather than 16 ounces of sour cream I used 8 ounces to cut back on the fat a little. Lastly I added extra broccoli which I cooked a bit before putting the mixture together. It is DEFINITELY a keeper of a recipe! I can't believe there are reviewers who do not like this recipe! It's one of the best Broccoli casseroles I've ever had!!:-) Thanks Cobra!",

I made this for guests tonight, one of whom doesn't have \"broccoli\" in his vocabulary and I was shocked to see him take seconds and say \"this stuff is awesome\" (why...that's part of its name!).  I didn't cook the broccoli as others have stated...the recipe states to drain and thaw the broccoli, which did the trick for me.  I also reduced the onion (alot) and added extra cheese...none on top.  I also cooked covered and then the last 10 minutes cooked uncovered, which prevented any burning! Great sidesish and would definately make again!",

Do not use all of the 16oz container of sour cream. I used 2/3 of the container and it was just perfect. Also, I did not use the whole large white onioin, I used about 3/4 of a large white oninon. I used Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing mix that comes in an 8oz bag (not box) but only used 6 oz. It was the crumbliest brand I could find and worked really well. I was in a hurry so I baked it at 400 for about 25 mins covered, so as not to burn the bread crumbs. Then uncovered it, I added the cheese on top and turned down the heat, baking for another 10 minutes. This was totally delicious, I brought it for a work Thanksgiving luncheon, and everyone loved it!!",

I used 2 16 oz bags of broccoli, 16 oz. low fat sour cream, 1/4 cup regular sour cream, 3 cups of cheese(I used a 4 cheese mexican blend because thats what I had on hand)The majority of this was mixed in with a small amount sprinkled on top. I had a large bag of Pepperidge farm stuffing that I used 8-9 oz of and threw in a little extra butter.I am not a huge fan of onion so I followed other reviewers advice and only used 1/2 an onion and chopped it real fine with my electrical chopper and it was the perfect amount. I also cooked the onion, corn and broccoli for 5 min.in the microwave before combining. I put it in a 9x13 pan, covered with aluminum foil and baked for 30 min. I then took off the foil and baked an additional 10-15 min. to make the top crispy. I bet this would be good as a meal with some chopped chicken or turkey mixed in.",

The last four times I made this, I precooked the veggies and had much better results. Definitely add more cheese to the mix if you're a cheese lover like me! I put very little cheese on top, as it tends to burn, and skimp on the stuffing topping as well. Also, consider cooking the dish 10-15 minutes more than listed.",

Also for a recipe like this I would like optional instructions for fresh broccoli instead of frozen. And I also felt that the dressing/stuffing would've been better had it been mixed in the casserole instead of browned on top - it was dry. The recipe tells you to put cheese on top of the stuffing but so many reviews said not to - so I just did it on one side. That side was still dry with rubbery cheese on top.",
