Great move on my part; these turned out fabulous!  My other changes: 2 whole eggs instead of yolks, sugar-free orange breakfast drink instead of juice (it's all I had) and baked instead of fried.  I used the advice of a previous reviewer and let the mixture sit in the fridge for about 40 minutes before shaping into patties and that made them hold together very well.  I sprayed a foil-lined pan and baked at 375 F for 25 minutes then let the patties rest for about 7 minutes while I threw together a salad.  The mayo is great, too!  It's so rich and flavorful that you need only a bit to dress up the patty.  By the texture of the baked patties, I'd say these would freeze well.  In which case, you'll find dozens of these in my freezer at any given time!  Addendum: Tried freezing without success.  They fell apart during re-heat, lost flavor and became chewy.  Still, they're not much work so making them fresh isn't a big deal.",

I cut everything in halt exactly except for the salmon I used a 6 oz. pouch (no draining) because they were on sale for 1. It was delicious! Non-dairy for me (lactose intolerant). It did not taste fishy at all to me. I made 6 very neat little patties. I make my patties by spraying a 1/4 measuring cup with Pam then stuffing the mixture in then plopping it out into the pan. All come out in uniform shape. Exellent! Will make again.",

We used fresh salmon instead of canned one whole egg a little less spinach and added extra garlic to everything as well as a pinch of cayenne and about half a tsp of ground corriander. I also scaled it down to serve two as it's just my husband and I eating. I didn't have orange juice on hand and just added a squirt of lemon juice to the cooking water for the couscous. Minor alterations really and these came out fantastic -- the couscous is wonderful because it forms a nice crispy crust on the outside of the patty but is creamy inside. Delicious!",

I try to stay away from frying so instead I baked them in muffin tins! Grease the pans and as they start to brown on the top (20 minutes or so usually) take them out and let them cool for 15 mins or so before getting them out of the pan. These freeze and reheat incredibly well so each time I make them I double the recipe and freeze half for lunches. Thanks for sharing! ETA: I am using lemon or lime juice now instead of the orange. I found we couldn't taste the orange juice but when I use 2 cups of couscous with 2 1/2 cups of water I substitute the 1/2 cup for other citrus. It's awesome that way.",

All of the cakes fell completely apart (and yes the oil was hot enough) and I ended up with a bowl of browned salmon cake hash instead of beautiful patties.:-( Nevertheless this recipe gets 3 stars instead of 1 star because when I tasted the \"hash\" it was delicious. Go figure! I'm takin this \"Moroccan Salmon Hash\" to a friend's house for a Moroccan dinner tonight. No kidding! P.S. I didn't bother to make the Garlic Mayo.:-)",
