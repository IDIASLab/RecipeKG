I am giving it only four stars because I thought it was a bit too salty (I would cut the salt to 1 tsp at the most) and I used only about 1 cup of MJ cheese which was plenty. Lastly I used brown rice instead of white rice and other than the fact that I needed to cook the rice about 20 min longer it tasted great! Definitely a keeper! Made it with the \"Chicken Chimichangas with Sour Cream Sauce\" on this website and my husband was very happy!",

Instead of tomato sauce and green chiles separate, I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. I used low sodium organic broth and added no additional salt. I cut the cheese to 1 cup and used a colby/jack blend. Paired it with black beans,spicy carnitas and fresh corn. My family devoured it! Will definitely be making this rice again and again.",

When I was adding the ingredients I thought \"Hmm that's a lot of liquid for one cup of rice \" but since nobody else had mentioned a problem with that I ran with it. Forty minutes later - I used brown rice - I picked up the lid and discovered half-cooked rice soup! This dish needed to cook for a full hour to absorb all the liquid and even then it was soggy. A normal rice-to-water ratio is 1:2 and this including the tomato sauce was almost 1:3. The fact that I'm the only person who had this problem including other people who used brown rice makes me think that I did something wrong but I really did follow the recipe as written. Dinner was well over by the time the rice was done cooking (luckily I had a backup) and when it finally wasn't soup anymore the flavors were nice. But there are so many mexican rice recipes out there I'll look for one I don't have to modify so much. Sorry!",

I freeze 2 or 4 cup bags when I make white rice. Add oil to sauce pan, I use olive oil, then add cumin and chili powder, bloom spices(cook until release their fragrance)for a minute or so, add garlic onion cook until clear.  Then add a 10z. can drained can of Rotel tomatoes w/cilantro and lime juice and 4 oz. of tomato sauce.  Stir until mixed and warm...in no time.  I don't add any salt and it tastes find.  I also save calories by not adding cheese.  Enjoy!",
