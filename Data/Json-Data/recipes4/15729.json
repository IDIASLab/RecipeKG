I used 1 lb 99% lean ground turkey seasoned with pepper and about a half tablespoon of granulated garlic (without salt), then added 8 oz of sliced brown mushrooms and the onion.  I used about 3/4th a head of large cabbage which I added slowly to the pot, wilting it a bit before adding the spaghetti sauce.  The majority of flavor comes from the sauce (I used a 16 oz jar, what I had) so use one your family really likes.  Then I added a quart of no sodium beef broth in place of the water and tomato soup mix and a tablespoon of dried Italian seasoning. Near the end of the cooking time, I added about 1.5 cups of cooked brown rice and grains that needed to be used (a great way to cut carbs if regular rice bothers you like it does my family).  We ended up with 8 large servings and with my changes, the calorie count dropped significantly.  We will use this base again because it is a solid base and easy to customize to your family's taste.  Would also be good with bell peppers in place of the cabbage.",
