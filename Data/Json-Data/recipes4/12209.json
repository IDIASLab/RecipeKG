I used half sausage, half ground beef, shredded carrot and onion, nutmeg and worcestershire, no cheese.  To my mind, the nutmeg and worcestershire sauce are the \"secret ingredients\".  Flatten the dough out and cup it in the palm of one hand while you fill with the other, using a slotted spoon so excess liquid will drain off first.  Then pinch the edges together while still in your hand.  I've made these for my family for over 30 years and they beg for them. A friend has a recipe for bierocks that is an old German dish, but pretty much the same recipe except she uses sauerkraut instead of cabbage, and swiss cheese.",

My grocery store was out of the bread dough in loaves, so I got a package of the dinner rolls instead (same dough, just in little balls). I think it may have worked even better - I rolled out two together once they had risen and it was just the right size. HOWEVER I made the brilliant choice to place the rolled out dough on pieces of waxed paper stacked together to make it easier. BIG MISTAKE! haha... the dough stuck so badly to the wax paper it wasn't even funny! But that was my mistake... I cut the recipe to 1/3 (only 3 of us in the house) and it was still way more than 6 burgers worth. Probably enough for 8-10 more! So I froze it to use next time. The flavor could have been dressed up a little, but overall I thought these things were great!",
