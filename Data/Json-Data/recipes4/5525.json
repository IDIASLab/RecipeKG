I added carrots at the beginning with everything else--it was fine. I also added some chopped celery to sneak in one more veggie. As written it is a good basic recipe. I think it needs something more. Next time I think I'll add spices as I thought it was very bland. The whole family ate it without complaints. Husband took leftovers for lunch. I'll try it again with some tweaking. Thanks for sharing.",

I didn't shred the breasts but as the pieces were so large I cut them into thirds and fourths. After rinsing and drying I rubbed them in various herbs and spices: Kosher salt fresh ground pepper; dried parsley sage tarragon thyme marjoram Greek oregano garlic powder; a dash of paprika and to give it a tiny bit of heat some red pepper flakes then let it \"marinade' 2 hours. I passed on the butter and used one of the new \"Knorr\" stock additives. I only had beef but figured with the cream of chicken the flavors would hopefully blend; this went in at the point I should have added butter. I used half a yellow onion and three scallions plus 4 small cloves of garlic. One thing the recipe doesn't mention is to check the crock pot; 5 hours before adding the carrots may be too long. I'm glad I checked mine as the chicken and 'gravy' stock was ready. I added the carrots (which I lightly sprinkled with Kosher salt pepper thyme) then a 20-ounce can of Pillsbury reduced-fat 'Grands'. Having read that some of the dumplings were raw even after 40 minutes I went with an hour for the final cooking time; put the crock pot on WARM then added the frozen peas. A green salad and a Texas Gew\u00fcrztraminer accompanied it all. Perfect for a winter night in KY. I'll definitely do this again my way!",
