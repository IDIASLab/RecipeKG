Although, the recipe calls for way too many marshmallows, and the sweetened condensed milk made it a little overly sweet for my taste. I would substitute some unsweetened evaporated milk next time, and cut back on the marshmallows. One thing I did that was good, I substitued broken graham crackers for the peanuts. It made it taste like little s'more nuggets. My family loved that.",
