After I took the meatballs out of the oven I sprinkled some of the parmesian cheese on top.

I'm glad someone suggested salt and pepper because the ingredients should have listed that since it calls for plain bread crumbs and raw chicken.  I added season salt but it still needed a little more.  To combat the dryness I made some dipping sauce (suggested by a recipe here for regular chicken cordon bleu): 1 can cream of chicken soup + 1/2 cup sour cream + 1 tsp. lemon juice (or white wine) + 1 T. parmesan cheese.  Heated in a small saucepan for a while, and the balls were really good dipped in it!  Added just the extra kick they needed.  Great recipe, and I'll definitely use it again!",

I wouldn't recommend this unless you keep the cubed ham out and instead put it with the cheese and make the ball around it. This is more of the tradition Chicken Cordon Bleu roll-up and that's why I did it. However I also made some with the ham mixed in with the ground chicken and made it the way the recipe suggests. Doing it this way is also very enjoyable but I recommend sticking with the reciped and dicing the ham and not using the bigger cubes as mentioned before.",

Also I think the swiss cheese and the deep-pan frying makes it too greasy so I'll fry it in a little butter/use the oven method and use some other cheese next time.
