I use riccota cheese and mix in some parmesan and 1 egg for the cheese filling. It doesn't take much more time to mix that up and it gives it a more authentic lasagna flavor.  Sometimes I use sliced cooked sweet Italian sausage and layer it in rather than cooking the sausage in the sauce. I actually prefer this to real lasagna, just as good for half the work!",
