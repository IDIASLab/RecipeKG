These were a nice change...could not even eat with dinner as we ate them before dinner was even ready. Just for those of you who have never grilled or baked onions, they loose there kick and become sweet. I did not grill these just baked at 350 in a foil pack. Also, if you want you can use olive oil instead of butter. oh yeah...make sure you trim half of the green part so they aren't chewy",
