I rarely fry things (to mess up the stove) but it was worth the effort.  My husband went back for seconds! Since my Swiss steak was 2 1/2 pounds, I used a 15 ounce can of petite diced tomatoes and a little extra water with a dissolved bouillon cube.  I did put it in a 9x13 dish after browning (so I could go ahead and clean the kitchen) and baked covered with foil. Frozen chopped bell peppers worked fine. I will not wait so long to make this again. Very yummy and tender, was good served with rice.",

I never do anything different except I use chicken stock in place of water. Also I sometimes use tenderizer on an inexpensive cut of beef but as long as the beef is pounded out and cooked for the time stated it really isn't necessary it is nice and tender. We eat ours with steamed jasmine rice yummy! Thanks for this great recipe.",
