This is the recipe that should make you change your mind! It is an easy cacciatore recipe that saves you the work and effort of browning the chicken and you don't lose an iota of flavor.    I stayed closed to the recipe but added one red pepper as well as a package of sliced mushrooms. I am told that isn't traditional but something called hunter's stew should have mushrooms....very earthy ;-)  I added six cloves of fresh garlic and omitted the garlic salt.   I used fire roasted  diced tomatoes and they really added a depth of flavor.  Because I added veggies, I also added a 14.5oz can of fire roasted crushed tomatoes and the sauce simmered itself to a really thick state.  I didn't have to add flour. Just threw the tomatoes in with their juices from the beginning.  In fact, the leftovers will probably need another can of tomatoes to get some sauciness back.  I did as the writer said and left the skin on the chicken which was a bit problematic as the chicken cooks until is falls off the bone so I had to chase out skin bits throughout the sauce.  I used 2 breasts and a package of thighs.  Next time, I will remove the skin.  Excellent recipe... served over egg noodles.  So good that I hid the leftovers in the back of the fridge where hubby might not find them!",

I didnt sautee anything...just put the chicken on top of sliced onion and bell peppers in the crock pot, mixed the sauce in a separate bowl and added on top of the chicken. I added a can of tomato paste and left out the flour. Next time I'll try a little red pepper to give it a kick!  Served over mashed potatoes, which was a nice change :)",

Used 1 cup of beef stock, 1 can of chicken stock and 1 cup of wine for the liquid. Also used LOTS of fresh chopped garlic, but then again there is no such thing as 'too much garlic' in our family.  Cooked the chicken most of the way, then added 1 red bellpepper and 2 small zuchinis.  Excellent way to sneak in extra veggies. ;-) Will definitely make again.  Hubby asked me to put it on the menu to make at least  monthly. :-)  5 stars from my family!",

Added two chicken breasts two thighs and two legs to the crock pot added salt and pepper. Poured in the wine added the sauteed veggies and italian spices (I had garden fresh basil oregano and rosemary) then topped with one drained can of tomatoes and one undrained can and a can of tomato sauce. I added the extra can of sauce because I needed a little more liquid for the crockpot - but I reserved (like it said i the recipe) the drained juice. And used that with flour to thicken at the very end. 4 hours at high pulled the meat out and shredded off the bone added back in for another 1 hour on low. it was fabulous and I am thrilled I have so much leftover!",
