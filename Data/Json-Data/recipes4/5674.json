I couldn't find any recipe that sounded tasty on the net for arctic char so I decided to try my cooking talent and come up with my own recipe. My husband and I couldn't believe how delicious this turned out, all of the flavors balanced perfectly. He wasn't hungry that night and ended up eating majority of the fish, haha!

This is my usual \"M/O\".\n\nI used 2T of lemon juice (husband hates lime...!?) and 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary (didn't have fresh) but otherwise followed exactly.\n\nIdeal internal temp \"they\" say is 140, so, I usually go a hair LESS (138 in this case would be ideal, think).  \n\nTemperature was 125 at 12 minutes; 133 at 17 minutes and 144 at 22 minutes; so while it WAS *awesome* (flavor/seasoning) and I give it 5 stars, next time I will leave it in for 20 min. @ 400 and broil for the last 2 minutes.  \n\nFYI, I had three good size filets on parchment in a glass baking dish.  (it makes a difference!) \n\nBeautiful fish!!  Thank you so much, and I hope this review helps others.  It may be that the foil you use, acts as a heat conductor and cooks it faster than it does on parchment. \nThanks again...GREAT fish.",

The fish is similar to a very mild salmon...which I actually enjoyed better than salmon. The sauce is absolutely wonderful and could probably be used on almost any fish. I had 1.5 lbs of fish so I doubled the sauce. I was a little concerned about doubling the garlic and rosemary so I used the following: 1/2 c. olive oil 1/2 c. sherry 3 sprigs of rosemary 2 cloves of garlic (frozen pods) and the zest and juice of 2 small limes. It was perfect although the ingredients as listed would probably have been great too! I blended the sauce in the blender and spooned it over the fish in a glass pyrex coated with avocado oil (no foil). Then I sprinkled the salt pepper and cayenne over the fish and baked it. I had extra sauce so I brought that to a boil on the stove to use for additional sauce...so glad I had extra because I almost wanted to drown the fish in it it was so good. We had the Quinoa Tabbouli salad on this site with it which was perfect. Or you could serve with rice or plain quinoa and spoon the sauce over. Can you tell I love the sauce?? Thank you for the recipe melanieni!!!",
