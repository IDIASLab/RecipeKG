This is a great base recipe. I have made it as written as well as some substitutions when not all ingredients are handy. I have switched the chives for parsley and I have added turkey bacon finely chopped. I eyeball the actual ingredients but then I'm sure we all do that. Each time it comes out fantastic. This will be a mainstay of my kitchen from here on out. I have served it on the side of cabbage rolls and the combination is amazing. My husband puts the sauce from the rolls on top as you would gravy on mashed potatoes. I have also used it as the \"mashed potato\" topping on my empanada filling since I always make way too much filling so I turn it into a sort of sheppards pie. This is a very versatile base recipe for many dishes. The best part is I don't have to squeeze out the water after steaming as I do when I make the cauliflower pizza dough recipe. This is just a wonderful recipe that everyone should try at least once. You will be hooked. I will also say I do use frozen cauliflower florets rather than fresh cauliflower because frozen is in my opinion fresher than the \"fresh\" produce we get in these parts plus I always have it in the freezer ready to go.",

I love the fact that this is a light substitution for mashed potatoes but most importantly it tastes good! But do keep in mind that it still tastes like cauliflower not potatoes but that s a compromise I can occasionally make (I do love mashed potatoes). Thanks Katie for sharing your recipe.",

I transferred it to a pot but it still jumped out too much for my taste. Then it wouldn't even mix well I kept having to add more chicken stock. In the end it was sort of flavorless. Even though I added extra cheese and extra spice. Topped it with a butt load of green onions and that was the only way we could all eat it. I liked it ok but the mess and the effort gives it 2 stars.
