I really appreciated the starting point, though and hope to make it as the recipe states at another point.  That said, it was a big hit.  I actually just used 2% milk instead of cream.  I also didn't wait 8 hours--only about 3.  The consistency was like Jello.  It was a nice light flavor.  Also didn't have brandy so just used the berries and sugar.  My fussy, fussy eaters were full of compliments and the dieters were delighted to know they weren't doing too much damage to the diet.  Thanks.  I'm looking forward to trying it again both your way and mine!",
