I know T-bones are tender already but this made them even better! For 4 steaks I added 3/4 cup red wine 1/4 pomegranate balsamic vinegar. This added a slight fruitiness that was yummy! I'm sure any fruit vinegar would work. I reduced the broth to 2 cups total. In addition to the other ingredients I added a heaping spoonful of garlic. Marinated the steaks for 6 hours or so then grilled. I also boiled the remaining marinade and added a cornstarch-flour mixture to thicken.",

I've always used a grill for steaks. She pulled up this recipe for me and I twirked it with what I had on hand. Delicious. I altered the recipe to feed SIX but didn't have the amount of broth needed. I had maybe 1/2 cup of ham juice (frozen) on hand so that's what I used. I was really unsure of how this would turn out because ham and steak just doesn't sound like it would mix but I'm glad I tried it. It's a new family favorite and was SO easy to cook. My t-bones were big and it took them about 10-15 minutes per side to get them medium-well. The 3-4 minutes suggested would have left them rare.",

It sounded good to both of us so we decided to give it a try. My fiance was adament that he be allowed to make the steaks so I let him. Neither of us really cared for the sauce. He didn't like the rosemary and I thought there was too much mustard. So I did some revising to better suit our tastes. After that I thought it was just fine. But all he tasted was the rosemary. So if we make this again we just won't put the rosemary in at all. After fixing the sauce I believe I really would've enjoyed eating this. Except my fiance over-salted the steaks so I couldn't even eat it without the sauce. Overall I didn't find it that great. But if we decided to make this again I'll definitely be the one cooking it.",
