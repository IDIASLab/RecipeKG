I started by marinading the chicken in a raspberry salad dressing while I was preparing the rest of dinner then took the chicken directly out of the marinade and dredged in a flour mixture (1/2 cup flour 1/2 tsp salt 1/4 tsp pepper 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning) then browned in a skillet with olive oil. For the sauce I only had one can of chicken broth but I went ahead and used the amount of garlic the original recipe called for but I skipped the 1st reduction step. Next I added 1/2 cup raspberry cranberry applesauce (Motts single-serve container) and 1/4 cup of frozen apple raspberry juice concentrate 1/4 cup white cooking wine and the salt called for. I simmered it until it had cooked down to a reasonable sauce consistency then poured it over the cooked chicken and topped with fresh raspberries. Because I had used the applesauce I didn't need to mess with the cornstarch to thicken anything. Wished I had had the frozen raspberries on hand to make more sauce but it turned out delicious as it was. Served with a spinach salad with raspberries and a raspberry viniagrette steamed asparagus and rolls.",
