I also used my bread machine for this which ground up the cheese and peppers which I knew would happen but I thought it might be okay. This recipe though does seem to need the pieces of pepper rosemary and cheese in it so I'll add it at the fruit and nut beep next time or use the KA mixer. I think I'll also double the jalapeno so we can taste it. I baked in the oven but at 350 for 40 minutes. Since I modified it not the submitter's fault that it turned out different than intended and this turned out really well even with the modifications so it's a good bread just maybe needs more modifications to work with what we'd prefer here. Thanks for the recipe!",

We didn\u2019t let it cool down before we tried it and have really enjoyed it. I\u2019m wondering if the Rosemary will come through more once it\u2019s cooled.
