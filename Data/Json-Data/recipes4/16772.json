I ended up not using the full bag of powdered sugar used about 2/3 instead but that had more to do with not needing that much glaze. Though instead of lessening the liquids I just kept these amounts. The texture is a little thin if you're frosting cookies or something like cupcakes but if you're just drizzling over rolls like I did or over say a pound cake then this works out well. It's not overly sweet but so tasty. Now I just need to make something to go with the extra I had.",

It was sweet and pretty much tasteless which is good because it's really not part of what you glazing it just makes something look more appetizing. It doesn't overpower your backed goods. It had a great consistency and went far. I'll make it again.",
