The only DELIBERATE change I made to the recipe was to cut the amount of yeast from two teaspoons down to one-and-a-half and next time I'm thinking of cutting it to one. (The one-and-a-half pound loaf comes out fairly high and it just barely squeezes into my plastic bread storage bags.) Thanks to this recipe I can have the rye bread I love (it's my favorite kind of bread) without the high fructose corn syrup -- and sodium I DON'T want. This recipe is a definite winner and a keeper! UPDATE TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: I figured out my too-high-loaf-won't-fit-in-bag problem. It wasn't too much YEAST it was too much GLUTEN. I've cut the amount of vital wheat gluten in half (One tablespoon instead of two) and it's PERFECT! No more store-bought rye bread for me! This is my \"go-to\" rye bread from now on!",

I have a Zojirushi Mini Breadmaker (BB-HAC10) that bakes 1 pound loaves. I found that dividing in half all the ingredient amounts in this recipe results in the perfect quantities for my Zojirushi breadmaker. I baked it using the regular cycle normal crust setting. The only other change I made is to substitute dark corn syrup in place of the same quantity of honey since I didn't have any honey on hand. This seemed to work great and as a bonus for some people turns this into a vegan recipe. As I mentioned above it tasted great probably better than the best store-bought rye I've had. In terms of texture it was light and fluffy - not dense like I would expect from a rye loaf. While I'm sure some people would prefer this light and fluffy texure I'd like to see if I can get a denser loaf. I may try the recipe on the French bread setting next time to see what happens. Thanks for posting this recipe Wynn!",
