My garden has been producing lots of swiss chard, and it has been ornamental thus far, since my husband doesn't like the flavor... or so we thought!  The top layer of chard got crispy, almost like a kale chip, and the bottom cooked perfectly.  Can't believe how roasting the chard changes it flavor (from my usual cook in bacon and onions on the stove flavor.) I love this recipe, also devine when you throw in a couple cloves of crushed garlic.  I can't wait to try some red bell pepper or walnuts in this as other reviewers suggested.  Also, I made the mistake of oversalting the first time- feta alone is enough salt for us!  Drooling still, thanks for sharing!",

I had less chard than the recipe called for so I adjusted the ingredients accordingly. I used some green onions from my mom's garden plus I added some green garlic that I also got in my CSA box with the chard. I didn't really pay attention to how long I cooked the stems but I popped in the leaves after cooking them for a while and they were perfect after 15 minutes (but I had way less chard than called for.) Roasting the feta really brings out the flavor and complements the taste of the chard to perfection. I'm already hoping for more chard in my CSA box but will go buy it at the store if I don't get any. Already craving it again!",
