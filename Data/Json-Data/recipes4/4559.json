I made this is a nonstick skillet and never could get the corn to actually 'blacken', all it seemed to do was create a fond in the bottom which when the beer was added dissolved onto the corn turning it brownish. I ended up trying several times to blacken it dry and just adding more beer. It does have a good flavor though and I couldn't resist eating it straight out of the pan. Maybe the winter fresh corn doesn't have enough sugar to it yet. Not having easy access to the cotija cheese I subbed a Mexican shredded mix. Didn't use the cilantro, not a fan, just sprinkled some sliced scallion on the top. Good flavors though and I finished the beer off. Thanks for the recipe!",

I think a cast iron skillet would work well for this but teflon worked fine. My corn was fresh corn that we had froze so I can't wait to try this with corn just cut from the cob. The flavors blended well together. I didn't have a red bell pepper so I used a yellow one. I added some diced tomato right at the end to add the red color.
