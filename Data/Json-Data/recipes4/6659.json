I also use soft white corn tortillas. For my family we prefer our original dish even though this recipe is good. This had great flavor and the crunch of the chips are a pleasant change and added a great corn flavor, however, the chips were almost stale tasting and hard to chew after baking. Overall, this meal was a good change for my family and I am sure that someone else would prefer this version over mine so I would strongly recommend everyone to try this recipe.",

I didn't have green chiles so I subbed in minced roasted red peppers for a little color and flavor. I only had Monterey Jack cheese which was a bit too mild - will definitely use Colby Jack or cheddar next time. Great way to use up leftover roasted chicken breast!",

Why not repurpose them before pitching them? And if you have leftover chicken this casserole is a dream for cleaning out that fridge! The only thing that would make this better is having a fried egg on top of each serving!!",
