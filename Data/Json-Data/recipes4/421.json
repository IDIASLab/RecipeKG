However, I did cut back on the amount of macaroni...32 oz. is waaay too many noodles; using 16 oz. is better, still get good results with 8 oz. and  cut back on milk to 2 cups and eggs to 2 and you still get a good sized casserole.  We like the top crusty, so I always add extra cheese on top.  Also use sharp or extra sharp cheese for more flavor.",

Dominant One from Marion Kay spices. I also substitued 4 cheese Mexican mix for the cheddar because that's all I had. I didn't taste it before I put it on the table and watched for hubby's reaction.
