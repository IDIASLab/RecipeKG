In glass measure cup mixed 1 egg, 1/4 c onion & chive cream cheese and enough milk to bring liquid to 2/3 c.  Added liquid to 4 c hash brown, 2 T chives, 4 green onion sliced thin, 1t minced garlic and used 7x11 glass baking dish.  Added dash of onion powder & garlic powder to veggies - used equal amounts fresh sliced carrots, celery and frozen green beans, peas, corn & broccoli (total of 16 oz) and lastly about 1/4 c finely chopped frozen spinach.  Didn't use bread crumb topping, put extra diced chicken (seasoned well when cooked) on top.  Next time will probably added a bit of evaporated milk to the condensed soup just to make it a bit creamier.  Family loved it!",

Added a pinch of rosemary to the chicken while I cooked it. And my fianc\u00e9 would have been awfully disappointed not to have that flaky crust she loves so much in a pot pie! I omit the breadcrumbs and made a pie crust to top it.",

Instead of the Cream of Mushroom, I did one can of Cheddar Cheese soup and one can of Cream of Chicken, a whole bag of mixed veggies and two chicken breasts diced, cooked and seasoned with salt/pepper.  Mixed it all together added some garlic powder, Italian seasoning and fresh onion. Covered the top with more hash browns back in the oven for 40 min (lightly browned taters). BAM!! Dinner is served and enjoy.",

I used cream of chicken soup instead and added probably a cup of milk or more we like it creamy. I also took into account that the potatoes on the bottom would soak up some liquid. I wasnt crazy about the eggs mixed with the potatoes but I liked the top crust. I will change the bottom crust next time. I added garlic salt onion powder and black pepper to the soup mixture. I also only used a 12 oz bag of mixed veggies and it was alot of veggies. My hubby doesn't like veggies and it was too much for him. I'll adjust the veggies next time too. I'm glad I found this for a starting point though. I gave 3 stars because without my tweeks it would have been dry and bland also beacuase if the potato egg mix. Happy cooking y'all!",
