        "description": "This frittata was my grandfather's signature dish and was only made during the holidays. It is cut up into 2-inch squares and put into the refrigerator to chill for an hour, which also removes any excess moisture. It is a great breakfast snack for hurried mornings. You can take them on the run and head for work. It is unusual, delicious, and easy to make and completely addictive. You will need a large non-stick pan, without a plastic handle, that can go in the oven. I usually eat the edges as I cut the frittata into squares.",
