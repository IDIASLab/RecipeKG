On the other, does it really live up to the name?   In this case, we are talking about a very traditional Scottish soup/stew: -a-Leekie.  As far as taste goes, it is OK.  It isn't a bad chicken stew, but there is nothing particularly exciting. Hence the three out of five stars.  BUT... it is NOT a traditional -a-leekie!  The carrots are there for the broth, and should be removed before it is served.  There are no prunes in this recipe, again a part of the original dish.  These may seem like minor problems, but they are vital components to the original.  So, is this a good recipe: it's adequate, but it is not a true -a-leekie stew.",

I did make my own chicken broth and used that in place of the chicken bouillon. And since this is a chicken soup basically I felt that it needed much more in the way of spices and herbs other than just salt and pepper. I added bay leaves thyme sage oregano and parsley to the simmering soup. Also the water proportions are way off for a cup of barley. I at least doubled or tripled the amount called for and it was fine as a thick soup for dinner. After it sat awhile it still continued to absorb the liquid and is now like a porridge. 2 1/2 stars for the way it's written 5 stars for taste and tweaks so 4 stars overall. Relax recipe review police it's still rated good.",
