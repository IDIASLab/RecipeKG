Personal taste adjustments:  reduce rosemary to 1/2 tablespoon, add 1 teaspoon peppercorns, use low sodium soy sauce, replace 4 cups of the water with 4 cups low sodium beef broth. Served with a garlic mayo (1 cup mayonnaise and 2 cloves minced garlic that married for 8+ hours).  Assembled buns with garlic mayo, roast and then topped with a selection of cheeses; manchego, provolone and horseradish (hubby liked the provolone cheese best) and broiled until cheese was bubbly.

But after everyone ate I took the leftovers shredded it, removed all visible fat, returned with juice to refrigerator.  The next afternoon I made a sandwich which my 8 year old son could not get enough of. I think it needed that time in the fridge to completely blend the flavors. I think the next time I make this, I will cook overnight, in the morning shred and put in fridge and then reheat for dinner. Delicious  Just wanted to add that the au jus makes a great base for French Onion soup",

I used 1 cup of low sodium soy sauce, 1-2 cans low sodium beef broth, 1 can Campbell\u2019s French Onion soup (because it had a beef base rather than chicken), and 3 cups of water. I also cooked over night and put it in the fridge for the day. Put rolls in the oven with Swiss cheese and broiled for a few minutes and then topped with saut\u00e9ed onions, mushrooms, and finally horseradish sauce. Served with Bleu Cheese Coleslaw from this website.",

I did not have any fresh garlic on hand at the time I made this, so I used a tsp of garlic powder as a substitute. I added a little garlic powder later in the cooking, too, to offset the tang of the soy sauce, which was just a personal taste thing. I also used and extra cup of water to the broth because I let this cook for 14 hours - I had a very long day - and didn't want the meat to burn. It turned out great!! Even the guys in my family who normally never comment on anyone's cooking said they loved it. I served the shredded beef on steak rolls with swiss cheese with the au jus in bowls for dipping. I expected to have leftovers for lunch the next day, but it disappeared! The soy flavor *was* pretty intense, but the flavors mixed well and it was really, really good. I'm adding this recipe to my monthly menu rotation.",
