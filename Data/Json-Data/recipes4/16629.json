I pitched it and started over. Would recommend that you beat your cream cheese mixture first so you re prepared to stir in the marshmallows as soon they re melted. This just didn t have enough marshmallow flavor for me the cream cheese dominated. Made this for breakfast this morning it was OK but doubtful I ll make again.",

Had to keep adding marshmallows and it still was not getting sweet, so I caved and added a tablespoon of powdered sugar and a splash of vanilla. Final result was basically cream cheese frosting.  Now I know why most recipes call for fluff, bc it is much sweeter than marshmallows alone.",
