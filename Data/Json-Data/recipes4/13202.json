I jazzed up the quinoa by cooking in vegetable broth and adding some italian seasoning mushrooms and asparagus because I had them and needed to use them up. Balsamic vinegar instead of red wine. Didnt have fresh lemon to put on top and think it would have made it even better. My husband (who I don't think was expecting much by the way!) said it was really good and maybe we should add some lemon pepper to the top before baking and I will try that next time. This is probably a 3 star before modifications and a 5 after so am rating a 4.",

My husband said \"wouldn't have expected quinoa in an Italian dish but it went very well together.\" I did substitute Pangasius instead of Sole which is a good alternative I read on a site. The quinoa I cooked less time than was given - medium low otherwise it would have scorched. My herbs were dry rather than fresh but that was not a problem. I just did the dry to fresh reduction. Also my vinegar was apple cider - didn't have red wine. Due to the thickness of the fish and quinoa I did have to take it out of the oven after the 4 minutes and carefully flip it so the other side would cook in the broiler. All in all a good healthy meal! Thank you.",

Solution: GARLIC! I added 2 cloves of garlic to the quinoa as it cooked, and then sliced a 3rd clove and laid that over the sole before popping it in the oven. I also sprinkled a little sesame oil over all before tossing it in. I can't have spicy food right now... but should my stomach again be able to handle it, I would love to try this recipe with a little hot red pepper chopped fine and added into the mix. Someone try it and let me know how it turns out!",
