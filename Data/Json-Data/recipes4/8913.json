And cutting Italian sausage links into bite-sized pieces is very time-consuming; I would recommend browning the links whole, then removing to cut, b/c I think it took me longer than the suggested prep-time to cut them, even having removed the casings as well. The 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning and sausage just didn't provide enough flavor for us, so we used crushed red pepper, parmesan and salt at the table. My husband said \"this 'feels' like a healthy meal, but I don't think it really is, so it's fooling me into eating more than I should\", whereas my daughter said \"it needs tomato sauce.\" I think I agree w/ both of them. Enjoyable to try, but not necessarily one that I'd make again.",

I made it a second time and added 2 Tbsp of tomato paste, some parmesan cheese, 3 chopped garlic cloves and some capers to add a little zing.  Turned out better than the first go round.  I think the oil and the fat from the sausage keeps the remaining ingredients from mixing well.  Also, I used diced tomatoes with italian seasoning.  Play around with this recipe.

The extra oil just adds more grease. add pepper. Personally I prefer to use individual seasonings instead of the Italian seasoning mix...but that's just me. add fresh garlic or garlic powder. add oregano. add parsley. add a bit of fresh grated Parmesan at the end. I also drained most of the water from the tomatoes b/c you don't need that much water & as the tomatoes cook they release water. Once you add your personal touches it's a great recipe...fast and delicious.",

Since I used a 16oz box of pasta I added a little extra water to help cook the pasta after I added it to the broth. If I had more broth I would have used that instead.",
