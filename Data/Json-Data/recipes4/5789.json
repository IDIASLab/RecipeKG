Next time i will cover it in foil until the last 10 minutes or so.  I served it with cornbread and it was delicious.",

I told myself that I would faithfully follow the recipe, then hedged a bit on the chili powder because I thought it might be too spicy and put in just over 1 tbsp.  I used mayo, even though I thought it sounded a little funny, but it turned out great.  I think I could have easily used the full allotment of chili powder because it was not spicy.  The mayo mixed with the other ingredients (I used Pace mild salsa) turned out to be a really nice tasting dish.  The chips on top stayed crunchy.  The cheese on top got really browned and crispy.  I added some more cheese when I took it out of the oven so that I had some oooey gooey cheese.  I served it with sour cream and everyone liked it!",
