I often substitute frozen meatballs when short on time and on one such occasion I was shocked that a woman who manages a very upscale restaurant in the area made an extra effort to rave about this dish (I was simply hosting a small crowd for a big college football game). I was almost embarrassed to reveal it's simplicity. I usually adjust the recipe to the same sauce ingredients but replace the homemade meatballs w/ caramelized frozen and throw it all in the slow cooker. The handmade meatballs are superior but I seem to get the same compliments regardless.",
