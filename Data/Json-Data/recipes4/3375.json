As written the recipe is short in that there is no real medley of flavors, relying heavily on a hefty amount of cumin and garlic powder--therefore, three stars.  But it's a good start. So... I sauteed a couple of strips of bacon until crisp, removed the bacon from the pan and added the chopped  poblanos which I didn't bother to blacken, half of a good sized onion, chopped, one minced jalapeno pepper, a few cloves of minced garlic (didn't use the garlic powder) and a chopped carrot (no corn for hubs). Once the vegetables were tender I added the flour, a little butter, a couple glugs of half and half for creaminess, the chicken broth and only 1-1/2 teaspooons of cumin. Let it come to a boil, then reduced heat and added the chopped chicken, the black beans, and some leftover rice (Zippy Rice Pilaf from this site to be precise). For those having trouble with the cheese clumping, it's important that you remove the pan from the heat before adding the cheese and let it melt in slowly. I seasoned to taste with salt and pepper and garnished each serving with tortilla chips, the crumbled bacon and chopped green onion. I served this as the submitter suggested, with Basic Corn Muffins, also from this site. Delicious!",

My dad called and said he had the best Cheesy Chicken Poblano Chowder in Donna, Texas..Could I find a recipe for one. Well I found this one and man let me tell you, It was soo easy to do. The only difficult part was peeling the chard skin off the peppers, and that wasn't that hard at all. The flavors at 1st, when making them, was--hmmm,okay where's it at, an the moment I put in the spices--MAN ALIVE!! The Cumin is spot on and I wouldn't change a thing. Well maybe add more Pepper Jack Cheese like a 1/2 cup more. Other then that, not a thing....Lovely Lovely!!! My mom will be making this for my dad....I'm bowing at the presence of greatness in this recipe. Yummy!!!!",

                "reviewBody": "This is fantastic soup. Every pepper will vary on how hot it is (even coming from the same plant...I used the poblano's from my garden and they were very different) so you will need to taste them before adding. I added 3 but next time will add more depending on how how hot they are. An easier way to get the skin off the peppers is to blacken them by putting them directly in a flame on a gas oven or a grill then follow the directions by putting them in a plastic bag. Much easier and less chance of burning them (which I have done). Just use a long BBQ type of utensil so you don't burn yourself. I otherwise made exactly as is except left out the chicken...no need for it in my opinion with the beans and cheese. Next time I will add an extra can of beans and maybe another pepper or two. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!! Fantastic!",

The cheese stucked to the bottom and sides of the pan and made lumps in the middle the soup was too thin ( probably because of the unmelted cheese) and did not have much flavor. I will just add some chicken and roasted poblanos to my old corn chowder next time and see what happens",
