There was lots of vegetables and proteins and the 4 cups of water definitely is not enough. I added the coconut milk and the broth quickly became a murky orange instead of the tradition translucent red. I would suggest not using the recommended 1/2 cup of coconut milk since it quickly overwhelms the flavors.",
