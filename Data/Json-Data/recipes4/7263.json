No waiting for the dough to rise; simply pour and spread on parchment paper and top with the beautiful and delicious toppings described here. Add salt for taste as desired because this is an initially low-sodium pizza. The healthiest, most closely authentic Italian crispy-thin-crust pizza you'll find. Say that fast! I have a very similar chicken spinach Alfredo pizza that's even better tasting.",
