We made 2 smaller 7 inch pizzas one that was the same basic recipe just with less cream cheese and one that had about a tablespoon of Dijon mustard mixed in with the cream cheese and then when it was done baking spread 1 -2 tablespoons of Mayo and sliced tomatoes on top. Both were very good. I highly recommend trying this.",

It just needed something more....flavorful (veggies, herbs?). I also thought the cream cheese was very overpowering. Maybe the suggestion to use 1/2 a package of cream cheese was a good one.
