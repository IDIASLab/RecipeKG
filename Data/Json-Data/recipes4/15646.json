After wanting to recreate a lentil salad I had from a local market, I realized I had made a salad more delicious than I had intended and it was nothing like I had been attempting to make. This salad is great as a side dish, a main salad, served on top of brown rice, or on top of a bed of lettuce.",

I wouldn't call it \"creamy\" but I used Gorgonzola instead of Feta and it probably would have been better if I had added it when the lentils were still warm. The recipe should specify. I probably would have given it 5 stars if I were allowed to use cilantro. When it comes to cilantro there's a deep divide in our home between the pro and anti-cilantro factions. Herbs especially controversial ones like cilantro should be a matter of discussion and deep contemplation before marriage. I was so head-over-heels in love with my fianc\u00e9 I chose be blissfully ignorant of his deep-seated aversion to cilantro and now I am paying the consequences.",
