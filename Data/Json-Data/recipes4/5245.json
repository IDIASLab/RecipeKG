This keeps well in the frig for a week and can be frozen for a later time. I hope you like it as much as we do. Please NOTE: the cheesecake part of the recipe doesn't rise but about 1/4 - 1/2 an inch but won't fall flat. It stays the same thickness as when you poured it in. It's thick and creamy but will stay firm after refrigerated. Don't flip out if you think it's suppose to rise because it won't.",

                "reviewBody": "As a cheesecake novice, I learned a few things by making this recipe.  #1. Mine also puffed during baking & fell in the refrigerator.  I read that this is due to overbeating of the eggs causing a \"souffle effect.\"  It didn't affect the texture of the finished product, other than the 4 edges remained raised.  Next time I will add the eggs as the last ingredient of the batter so as not to overbeat them.  #2. There is an art to cutting cheesecake so that the filling doesn't cling to the knife.  Use a very thin, sharp blade (steak knife) and dip it into the hot water often to prevent dragging the filling and making messy edges.  #3.  My grocery store did not have candy flavoring, so I bought peppermint extract.  I used 1 tsp. in the batter.  They also did not have mint chocolate chips or even mint chocolate candies (Andes)!  So I bought dark chocolate chips & white chocolate chips.  I colored the white chips with a drop of green coloring in a plastic bag.  They somewhat absorbed the color.  Pale green mint chips would've been prettier, but this worked fine.  Also because of the lack of mint in the topping, I think the batter could've used more than 1 tsp. of peppermint extract to stand up to the strong cheesecake flavor, maybe 1 1/2 tsp.  #4.  I cut the squares & arranged them on a plate, & then drizzled melted dark chips from the corner of a bag onto each square individually.  This prevented smearing the chocolate onto the pale green filling during cutting.  LOVE IT! THANKS!!!",

I had some leftover thin mint girl scout cookies so I crushed a bunch of those for the topping and mixed with the amount of butter called for in the recipe and yum!!! I also used crushed Andes mints to garnish and melted milk chocolate chips to drizzle over the top. My fiance and I ate them after the 2 hour refiregeration like the recipe called for, and they didnt taste that great. I would suggest letting them completely chill over night before eating because it made a huge difference in the taste and then we couldn't stop eating them!!",
