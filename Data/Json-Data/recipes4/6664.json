I used a thick cut bacon that had very little fat on it, so the onion and peppers generated most of the cooking moisture as opposed to bacon fat.  I think I will make this again and perhaps tweak some more ingredients (possibly garlic, or cumin...possibilities are endless!).",

I added a half cup of white wine to the drippings and cooked the onions while the wine reduced adding the spinach when it was almost dry. After adding the bacon onion and spinach mix into the quinoa I added about a tsp of lemon juice and a tsp of cumin for flavor. Did not use cilantro though I would if I had it. In the future I'll use even less bacon and chop it into smaller pieces and use low sodium chicken broth. Will definitely make again!",

Here is what I did: I added juice of two lemons to the chicken broth for the quinoa; that added a nice citrus flavor that complemented the spinach. Most of all I recommend cooking the bacon separately until it is crisp and then cook the onions. I cooked the two together (bacon and onions) for at least double the time suggested and the bacon never firmed up or crisped at all. It was soft and chewy which was disconcerting. The flavors mixed together well especially the lemon. Lastly we added shredded cheese to the top but Parmesan would have been better than the cheddar mozzarella mix we used. This was our main meal not a side.",
