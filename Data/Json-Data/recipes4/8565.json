I didn't have croutons so I used panko breadcrumbs instead. I had to bake the eggplant longer about 20 mins per side at 375. I would recommend using 1 large pan to bake the eggplant in and then take it out and use that same pan to bake it in with the sauce and cheese. I would not season the egg wash I had to use 2 eggs but would season the breadcrumbs I had to use 3-4 cups. I seasoned the breadcrumbs with garlic and onion powder red pepper flakes s p and lots of it. Eggplant is so mild. I only had to bake it for 15 mins with the sauce and cheese. You could put turkey pepperonis on top when done or bake them on top with the eggplant. Overall a good meal.",
