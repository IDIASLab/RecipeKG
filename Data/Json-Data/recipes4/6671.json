Use regular Greek feta cheese,and add in a little more butter if you are concerned about creaminess. Feta cheese does not melt well as well all know, so crumble it finely instead of chopping it. I also sprinkled mine with roasted pine nuts per my preference, but it was not necessary. The simplicity and great taste of this recipe is what makes it so special. Please give it a try.",

I followed the recipe almost exactly except that I had a shallot to use instead of the onion and I added twice as much spinach as I also wanted to use that up. I chopped it into pretty small pieces before I added it and used regular feta cheese which actually melted quite nicely and added some nice salty accents. This would be a fine dish for company - it is very pretty to serve and easy to make. It would also sit for quite awhile I imagine - maybe half an hour or so - if you keep it covered. Thanks for a new addition to my rotation.",
