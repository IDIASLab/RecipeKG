We regularly saute onion, green and red peppers and add a tomato sauce that contains very few other ingredients than tomato, or 100% tomato.  This recipe helped us to adapt our recipe to add the zucchini at the very end of the cooking process.  It's a great recipie, and to make it a little more heart healthy and a lot faster to prepare, try olive oil, pre-diced garlic, and a heart-healthy canned spaghetti sauce.  Add mushrooms and peppers for added taste.  If you are adventuresome and not concerned with a little trans fat and want to add a little saturated fat for taste, try adding from between 2 or 3 tablespoons to 1/2 lb. Italian Saugsage for seasoning.  ",
