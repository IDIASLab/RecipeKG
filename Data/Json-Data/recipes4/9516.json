The recipe used to be on the chips bag but I haven't seen it there in years. It IS rich but it is also soooo good! The only change I'd make just to make the prep easier: Instead of a double boiler just combine the chocolate chips confectioner's sugar butter (cut into bits) and water in a medium size glass bowl. (I use a 4-cup glass pyrex measuring cup.) Stir to combine then microwave on high for 1 min. Stir again and microwave an additional minute. Stir til chips melt and mixture is smooth then spread immediately. Like other fudge if you stir too long it will get too thick to easily spread. Also refrigerating the krispies while you prepare the fudge layer makes it much easier to spread the fudge over them. We keep ours in the fridge after they're made and take squares out as we want them. They hold together better and the taste is much better chilled than room temp.",
