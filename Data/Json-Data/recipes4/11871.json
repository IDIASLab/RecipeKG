For a nice variation, I also added frozen italian greenbeans and other veggies.  This soup would also be good with beans, rice, meat or pasta added as well.  Good on a cold day! ",

My son doesn't like celery so he turned his nose up to the soup so for lunch the next day my husband pureed the soup in the blender put it back in the pot added a little milk and chopped sausage.
