I love spicy food, so I thought it was just perfect, and the honey really help add a layer of sweetness to the chicken that my taste buds thoroughly enjoyed. I cooked the chicken at 350 for about ten minutes and then 245 for another ten minutes and it was very juicy because I didn't want to risk it going dry.I also didn't add the italian season because it just seemed weird to add, but other than that, c'est magnifique!",

Delicious ... spicy, but could be mellowed by using half Sriracha (Chinese ketchup) & half \"American\" ketchup. Since I already had a 2# package of 4 small drumsticks & 4 small thighs, after skinning them, I coated each completely with the sauce (ample for the 8 pieces), and rolled all in Panko bread crumbs. Baked at 350-degrees for about an hour, they were soooo good! Thank you for coming up with this recipe, Sadaf.",

At that point I added more Sriracha to taste, perhaps 1 part honey to 1.5 parts Sriracha.  I also used BLSL thighs for better chicken flavor.  This is a great example of a recipe that anyone can make to taste.  Thank you, Sadaf!",
