My 5yr old devoured her helping as did my hubby and roommate. Served over brown rice and next time, I will have to double the recipe because we couldn't get enough!

I didn't have any cream of mushroom, so I substituted cream of chicken and threw in a jar of mushrooms.  Maybe that's what went wrong.  I also added some ground pork because I didn't have quite 1 pound of chicken.  Usually stir-fries are \"dry\" not moist.  If your short on time and don't have much in the cupboard..then maybe.  Just make sure you have the pizza guy on speed dial.",
