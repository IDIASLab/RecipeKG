I made a few small changes 1) I had precooked bacon on hand so I used that. In place of the bacon fat I cooked the onions and mushroom stems in olive oil and butter. 2) I used panko instead of regular breadcrumbs. 3) I don t have a blender so I just chopped things very fine and mixed everything together. Finally I made the filling the day before then stuffed the mushrooms early the day of the party and refrigerated until I baked them later in the evening. This seemed to work out just fine and made prep for the party much easier.",

My changes: I cooked the bacon in the microwave and then carmelized the mushroom stems onion and garlic in olive oil. I did not use a blender but did dice the mixture fine. I used panko bread crumbs and did use my mixer to incorporate all ingredients. I I actually made the filling the evening before refrigerated it in a sandwich baggie overnight and then let it sit on the counter for 30 minutes before snipping off a corner of the baggie and piping it into the muchroom caps. I did use Cremini mushrooms - 16 oz. (2 packages) to be exact. I feel these mushrooms are beefier and stand up better to oven baking and holding stuffing. I baked for 20 minutes in a 400 oven in a shallow Corningware dish. I adjusted the recipe to make 8 servings but I used only 1/2 the filling and was able to fill about 30 some mushrooms! I still have left over filling in the fridge but I believe I'll use it as a stuffing for chicken or a topping for ribeyes! Everyone of the ladies loved these mushrooms and several mentioned they'd have never known there was blue cheese in them! I had a woman who hates blue cheese eating multiples! These were really delish!",

I used a chopper to finely chop the mushroom stems and the onion and used a fork to mix all the cheeses together - did not use a blender. I mixed two different cheeses to make these along with the cream cheese. I used a good quality blue cheese for 1/2 and used a sharp cheddar cheese which was finely grated for the other half. Lots of great flavors. Definifitely try this recipe.",
