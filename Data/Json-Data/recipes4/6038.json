I assembled everything the night before so all I had to do was take the dish from refrigerator to oven the morning of-- a great time saver.  Everyone loved it, even my niece who is not a fan of eggs, had 2 helpings.  The only note I would make is I think the amounts of mustard powder & butter are transposed.  I used 2 tsp of mustard powder (Not 2 TBL ) & 2 TBL of butter (not 2 tsp). I also cut the milk to 2 1/2 cups.  Will definitely make this again.  Probably at Christmas.",

I never use white bread for these recipes but instead chose a whole wheat bread with nuts in it...it added a wonderful texture! One last addition was onions. I love spinach but omitted it because I was concerned about it being too moist. I added onions. Next time I will add the spinach and compensate with more eggs.
