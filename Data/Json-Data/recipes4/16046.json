THIS chili might change that (thanks Big P!) as I really liked it that much that I'll probably make it again. It was easy to put together I actually liked the big hunks of red onion and celery (although I'd consider adding bell pepper) and all the ingredients were easy to come by and all came together for a fantastic no-fussiness chili.",
