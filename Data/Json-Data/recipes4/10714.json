You definitely need to add the 2 Tbsp. of white sugar to decrease the tartness but other than that this recipe is spot on in terms of flavor. I used toasted walnuts instead of almonds (personal preference) a mixture of romaine lettuce and spring mix along with the red onion added some thin sliced Granny Smith apples that I soaked in a bit of lemon juice and water to prevent them from browning craisins and feta cheese. That mixture proved to be the right combination of sweet and tart and needless to say it was very pretty! It was also a great way to use up leftover turkey the next day I diced some of it and put it over top - YUM!",

Because of the dressing's rich pink color it looks very festive in small cork-topped bottles (I found mine at Michaels for 99 cents). For giving I put each bottle in a cellophane bag and tied it with raffia and a twist of red star-spangled wire and included the recipe for both salad and dressing.",

When using in the salad I also add a bit of sugar to calm the tartness. Toasted almonds add a wonderful crunch. I also use crasins as they are available year round and a reliable quality product. Any extra craisins I toss in the salad. Romaine lettuce is my favorite as it is crisp and light. I add a bit more olive oil when using in a salad. Better consistancy. A fantastic recipe that can also be fiddled with for your families taste preferences. Not an ordinary \" fruity \" dressing!",

Here is what I did to change the recipe up: I added 2 TBS of sugar to the dressing, substituted Feta for the blue cheese, added 1/2 cup of Craisins to the salad greens. I prefer it with toasted almonds, hubby prefers it with pecans. The last time I made this we had 9 eating and this still made plenty. This tastes like something you would get out at a nice restaurant. The color of the dressing is a very pretty pink and it is especially lovely during Thanksgiving, Christmas and Valentine's dinners. **Update. My store was out of cranberries so I subbed raspberries and had to add a bit more sugar but was still yummy! Thanks.",

Besides being far too tart (which after reading reviews I was prepared to add sugar but I gave the written recipe a fighting chance as written) but also even with such bold flavorful ingredients I found it rather \"flat\" or \"lacking\". I started the \"tweaking\" with a tablespoon of sugar and additional pinch of salt. Better but not there. It just had no depth. So another tablespoon of sugar went in followed by more dijon and eventually about 3 times the garlic. A volunteer taster agreed that it just seemed really one dimensional so finally with the addition of 1/2 tsp thyme and three green onions it was really a lovely dressing but by then it was not this recipe at all thus the three stars. This all surprised me because I took that first bite expecting to love it. I just found it lacking but a nice base for additional flavor.",
