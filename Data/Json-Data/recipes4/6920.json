I may add red pepper flakes next time to give it a little extra kick but the white truffle oil did make cauliflower soup really amazing. I use my emulsifier to blend right in my pan. I don't like to dirty another appliance if I don't have to. This is much easier to clean then a blender! Just remember to remove from heat and set emulsifier in the pan and set to the on position! White truffle oil is available at Italian markets, many specialty foods stores, and select supermarkets.",

However once it was done it was so thin that I just had to add some cornstarch slurry. The flavour was pretty good but could have used some herbs. The truffle oil is in my opinion a brilliant addition. A sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley on top would have increased the eye appeal. Thanks!",
