However I did use my instant pot so the order of cooking was a little different. I saut\u00e9ed the onions and then added the garlic after the onions were nearly done. Then I added a little or Oregano And saut\u00e9ed a little longer. I deglaze the pot with a little white wine.  I then added the 4 cups of water and the chicken soup base. I threw in two frozen clump together chicken breasts from Costco. I cook these for 25 minutes and then did natural release for 15 minutes. Took the meat out and shredded it threw it back in the pot added all the rest of the ingredients and it was amazing! Thank you thank you for sharing this recipe.",

Minimal  changes made is I used already cooked shredded xcken the store makes out of the rotisseries that don't sell (helps with added flavor and also laziness),  I completely de-seeded the peppers just in case (will not do so next time for more spice) and I think my garlic cloves and large onion must have been really large because I didn't use all of them.   Wouldn't change a thing!  Thank you for not listening to your husband and sharing.  This is a keeper for sure - and I will always give due credit to SerenaBloom and AR =)  No pic as it was gone before the flash went off.",
