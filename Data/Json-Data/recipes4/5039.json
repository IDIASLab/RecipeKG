I combine my olive oil and minced garlic together and drizzle that over top while the tomatoes are grilling. After they come off I sprinkle with a little salt and pepper then top with fresh basil. Sometimes I add either fresh mozzarella for a \"grilled caprese\" or shredded Parmesan although they're great plain. No matter what you do these taste wonderful and can be a great appetizer or side dish. The leftovers (if there are any) are great on thick crusty bread!",

I normally just do the olive oil and some kosher or regular salt. I will have to try adding some fresh garlic next time to see how that affects the taste. I am just a tad afraid of the fresh garlic burning. It really doesn't need it. Roma tomatoes tend to work the best just cut in half. If you have never grilled a tomato you must try.",
