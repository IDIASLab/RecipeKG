However, I didn't need to throw the potatoes in a slow cooker as my cooking plans changed and a holding pot wasn't necessary. Now, I have a question. Why do people have to leave such cranky reviews about a good recipe that they might not have even tried?? The poor reviews really knocked the rating down unnecessarily, and I'm really sick of reading snide, \"know-it'all\" reviews wherever I go on the internet. This recipe was intended for those who had too much cooking to do and needed a way to make it ahead without having to reheat the dish. Who cares if I have to wash something extra? If a recipe doesn't appeal to you, please just move on to something that does without ruining it for those who might want to try it. This was a wonderful idea and a good recipe. Thank you!",

Thaw out a bag, put in a sauce pot over a very low flame and stir a few times and you would think they were just made. I also add a couple of bay leaves and black pepper to the salted water when boiling them. I scrub mine well and leave the skins on before cutting and boiling then mash with a hand masher because I like chunky skin on mashed potatoes. Also I swap out the chicken broth and use half and half. I know, rich but what the heck, very comforting and we don't eat them every day. Whenever there is a family get together I always get asked to bring \"your\" mashed potatoes.",

Had to make them the day before and then take them to my mom's so the slow cooker worked out perfectly. Some other comments made me worry about getting too watery so I only used half the chicken broth figuring I can add more the next day if needed but it wasn't needed. I only cooked for about 2 hrs the day they were made then day of high for an hour and low for an hour adding the melted butter after turning to low. Good news was they turned out great bad news is now its my job every thanksgiving from here on out. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",

Delicious soup but still soup. No one complained and in fact they all complimented me on how delicious they were. The only deviations I made from the recipe was to mash the potatoes with a manual potato masher instead of whipping with an electric mixer so they were more chunky than whipped. Plus I prepared the potatoes the night before Christmas and refrigerated them overnight. Maybe that is where the excess moisture came from. This is a total winner taste-wise as a mashed potato recipe so I'll continue to work with it. The benefit of last minute prep prevention is worth further experimentation with this recipe.",
