Remember to ALWAYS invert the hot cake pan over the neck of an empty wine or large soda bottle until it's cool.

The only difference in the directions I was given is that I was told to NEVER prepare the pan.  I was told that the angel-food cake would not rise properly if I greased and/or floured the pan.  The only time I did so (had a senior moment and forgot), the cake still tasted good but did not rise like it had when I had not prepared the pan. No one else has mentioned this, so I guess it is working great for most of you.  However, I noticed one person did say her cake did not rise, and I thought this might be the reason.
