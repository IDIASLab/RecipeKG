I ended up getting the long green mild chiles. I roasted them and after I peeled the skin realized that it was going to be pretty much impossible to slit and stuff them neatly - the roasted peppers are thin and slippery. There was also the seeds inside that I didn't feel should be left in there so I seeded them as well as skinned them. I then put the roasted pepper on a fajita size flour tortilla and proceeded with adding the mixture and wrapping like a burrito. A key flavor is the enchilada sauce so get that has good flavors. In the larger grocery stores they usually have a good selection of specialty sauces - check those out. I used one that had roasted peppers and citrus. I used mexican Fresco cheese in the chicken mixture and then sprinkled a mexican blend of shredded cheese on top. The roasted green chiles are so delicious - I'm going to think twice about buying canned ones again!",

                "reviewBody": "Fantastic! I know the recipe was talking about poblano peppers but I can see how it could be confusing. I made it for dinner tonight and my SO said it's \"fantastico! que sabor! que rico!\" If you have the opportunity roast the poblanos on the grill over a really hot fire (like just as soon as you get the coals going). The skin will blister and blacken easily. Keep turning them until you blacken them on all sides and then toss them in a doubled or tripled plastic grocery bag and tie it shut. When the chiles are cool enough to handle the blackened skin will be easy to remove. Run the chile under cool water to wash off the last bits of skin. At this point if you're cooking ahead you can pat them dry and store in the fridge overnight. Take them out and let them come to room temp before stuffing. If you're the type that likes to putz with appetizers you can do the same thing with nice big jalapenos but you need to remove the stem end and get the seeds.Then you'll be stuffing the chiles from that end instead of cutting a slit. This is a fantastic recipe. Thanks for sharing it.",
