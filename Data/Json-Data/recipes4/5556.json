I used red bell pepper instead of green Angus beef hot dogs and Campbells Chunky Roadhouse Chili. I made little bowls of chopped tomatoes sliced green onions shredded sharp cheddar and reduced fat sour cream to top the servings with. My family RAVED about this casserole especially littlest who can be a little picky. My husband and oldest went back for seconds. This was fabulous--not only was it quick it also used ingredients I had in my pantr/fridge which made it very cheap to make. This recipe's a keeper!",
