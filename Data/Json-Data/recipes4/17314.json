I used a 2 quart pyrex measuring cup to bake the cake.  For ears, I purchased a bunny headband.  The bunny headband was white so I saw no need to make a pink bunny.   When the marshmallow is cut, it is 2 half circles.  I couldn't find fruit roll-ups so I stretched a strawberry \"Laffy Taffy\" and cut the shapes I needed for the foot pads.  I used Easter grass around the bunny.  (NOT the cellophane type as it would have too much static). This was a fun recipe to make.  Thanks barb1031c for sharing such an ADORABLE recipe!",

THIS RECIPE IS FOR A PINK BUNNY.   Not a white one as shown in the picture.  It was more time consuming and a bit more difficult to make pink if you're not experienced coloring coconut. I couldn't find liquid food coloring, only gel.  It wasn't as easy as liquid drops.   Also the other recipe called for edible grass, which is better looking (in my opinion) than once again  dying coconut.",

I ended up using one bisected in half. Like other reviewers I found the whole fruit roll-up a pain! Where I did find them it was buy in bulk or bust. Lol I ended up with a version of them and worked around some kind of tongue tattoos printed on them and they were red not pink. I wish I would have seen the lady\u2019s review that said she used laffy taffy* she stretched out and made her cuts. I so will be doing that next time! I didn\u2019t have the snazzy popsicle sticks for the ears but being crafty and always making do with what\u2019s on hand I cut a disposable drinking straw in half and taped it to the ears I made. I found the pleasant surprise that the straw\u2019s hollowed out center was nice and sturdy in the cake and made positioning a cinch! I also did what other reviewers suggested and used Easter basket grass around the cake (just didn\u2019t feel like messing with coconut and food coloring lol) and I for the life of me couldn\u2019t find pastel almond m&m\u2019s* so I used some pastel jelly birds eggs. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE SUPER CUTE (off the cuff and funny conversation piece) RECIPE!!! Much appreciated and the added bonus was no specialized mold! Happy Easter 2021!",
