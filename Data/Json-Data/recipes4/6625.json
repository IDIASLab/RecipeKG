Used a bunch of fresh radishes from the grocery store.  Cut them in about 1 inch chunks and seasoned with just salt and pepper.  Sauteed on med/med high and turned them occasionally as they browned.  Not EXACTLY like potatoes but close enough to satisfy that starchy thing.  Low carb too. I think the one person who thought this was bitter must have used old radishes. I was very pleasantly surprised at the creamy mild flavor. Definitely a keeper.",
