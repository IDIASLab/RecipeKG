Firstly we dont use curry! Maybe a tsp when \"seasoning\" the whole chicken but not to this extent. Secondly Pelaus can be made with ANYTHING it's the method that's standard... and this is not it. The actual method is somewhat tedious though we do call it a \"fast-pot\" or \"one-pot\". I will post a more genuine recipe soon but beware that we eat highly \"seasoned\" foods unlike those generally consumed in the US.",
