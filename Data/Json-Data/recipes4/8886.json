Including the canned condensed milk. It came out like milk and not like a blended drink. It comes out a little watered down too and not chocolatey/coffee enough so I added 1-2 tablespoons of Hershey's Cocoa for baking and less ice cubes. I think it needs some Espresso Powder to give it a more coffee flavor than milk flavor. I had extra so I froze it in cubes so all I need to do Is blend it.",
