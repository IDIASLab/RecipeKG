I used about a cup and a half of cooked rice from a couple nights before. I sauteed one onion garlic and about a cup of shredded carrots and added that for a little more flavor threw in about a cup of shredded white cheddar and sprinkled a bit on top before baking it long enough to warm all the way through and melt the cheese. I served the hot sauce on the side as I have two kids and they can't stomach super hot food. My kids and I liked this my husband is on the fence. I think the whole amount of mayo is a little too rich next time I might do half sour cream or yogurt. Like I said good base recipe and a nice change from your typical tuna casserole. I'd make this again. GREAT way to use up your leftover rice from dinner the night before or from your chinese food order.",

Together with a half can of pees I added that to the mix. Also I used Bird's Eye frozen brown rice steamed in the microwave (saves the step on cooking rice). I sprinkled on hot pepper flakes because we aren't shy about spicy hot foods. My husband is not too keen on casseroles but he really enjoyed this! It is definitely a keeper. The recipe was not mushy at all. It might be because of the brown rice which holds up a little better than white rice. It also is more nutritional. Since I am wheat intolerant this is a fantastic substitute for the regular old tuna casserole.",
