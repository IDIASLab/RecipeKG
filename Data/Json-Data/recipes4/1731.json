Store in a jar in refrigerator.\r\n\r\nI wish this site had a message board area where we could ask questions about ingredients or a process in a recipe we don't understand.\r\n\r\n",

We love this over a bed of white rice. If you can't find Catalina dressing use Russian it is close just not quite as spicy. I also seem to have trouble finding Apricot Jam so I substitute preserves and it works just fine. I season the pork chops in salt pepper and garlic powder prior to browning. You can add a splash of soy sauce to this if you want to. This has a nice sweet and sour taste to it my mouth is watering just writing this!",

If your chops are less than a full inch thick be sure to check them early; mine were probably closer to 3/4\" thick and I felt they were a tad bit overdone even with the reduced temp/time. I couldn't find apricot jam and had to make do with preserves but I don't really think that makes much difference. While the taste was a little more fiery than we usually care for we did eat it all up in one night and I will probably make it again. I think the Catalina dressing AND pepper together were what made it a little on the too-spicy side for us; next time I'll skip the pepper and see if it makes a difference. I may also use more apricot to make it a little sweeter.",
