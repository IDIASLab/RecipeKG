Due to many countries importing and exporting metals, and not knowing if lead could exist in the can, I would like to suggest using a container, which is oven safe for the beer. The labeling on the can could also carry toxins in the paint used to decorate or advertise. I have found small oven safe bowls for this purpose, and they do come in handy for other uses as well.",

I was in a hurry this time and just cooked on a broiler pan in the oven and cooked veggies separately. Came out great. This is a huge hit every time I make it. With the left overs, I take the carcass and boil. Remove bones etc.. it makes a great soup with some added noodles and seasoning. This last time I froze the soup and when the weather cools down it will be an easy dinner to thaw and add some simple dumplings for a hearty Chicken and Dumplings dinner. This is a true winner and can easily be a 2 in 1 meal.",

I also used poultry seasoning rubbed onto the greased chicken. The smell in the house drove us crazy it was so good. I will definitely be using this recipe almost weekly.",

It can be used in the oven bbq grill etc. It also has many other uses. I have three of them. If you use this recipe a lot you would love this item.
