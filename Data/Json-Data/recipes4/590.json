I sauted the chopped mushroom stems with some finely chopped onion and minced garlic before adding them to the prepared stuffing mix.  I also used 2 cans of real crab meat instead of the imitation, cuz I had some in the cupboard that I had picked up at the 99 cent store.  I also put a healthy pinch of grated Parmesano Reggiano on top of each stuffed mushroom before baking.  Had to bake these for about 25 minutes, though. They smelled wonderful while they were baking, and I took them to my card club and the ladies snarked them all up.\n\nOne thing:  Even though I used a 24 oz box of mushrooms, and piled them high with stuffing, I had quite a bit of the stuffing left over.  The next day, I bought another 24 oz box of mushrooms and made these again for just my husband and me for dinner.  If Gary only uses 12 mushrooms, and uses up all the stuffing, the mushrooms must be ENORMOUS.  Great recipe, though!  Will make again and again.",

(you can either us the canned ham, or chop up some deli ham).  -I've never tried them with cream cheese, but think it would be a nice compliment to the ham. -\r\nalso, for extra moist mushrooms (and to save a little fat), omit the butter and drizzle a little chicken broth over the  stuffed creations just before baking. \r\n",

This is one of those recipes.  I eliminated the crabmeat since I had none on hand and J_TATUM and LOTHRID both said this did not hamper the success of the recipe.  I used one and a half sticks of butter during step five, and a half stick during the preparation of the boxed stuffing, bringing the total butter usage to 1 cup.  This was in response to the postings which said too watery or too much butter.  It worked fabulously.  Served these at a dinner party with much success.",

I used one stick of butter to saute the garlic, then I added the cream cheese to the melted butter/garlic until it was melted and smooth.  I added this entire mixture to Stovetop chicken flavored stuffing and added two cans of Geisha snow crab meat.  It does make alot of stuffing but it freezes well so you can save some for another batch of stuffed mushrooms.  These taste unbelievalbe.  Whether I make 25 or 75 of these for a party...every last one is eaten.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!",

I omitted the crabmeat used mushroom and onion flavored Stove Top and light cream cheese. And the butter-there's no reason to use that amount! I just used the few tablespoons it took to make the stuffing and that was it. When I finished stuffing the mushrooms I sprinkled them with a little Parmesan cheese paprika and dried parsley flakes. Right before baking I also sprinkled on a dry white wine and poured just enough wine in the pan to cover the bottom of it. Perfection! Everyone loved them!",

We had a restaurant here in St Louis that closed and I've been searching for their mushrooms and this recipe is close to it. I read most of the reviews and changed things a bit myself I made this with pork sausage (no crab) and half the butter. It was great and dont tell anyone but I ate 6 myself (needless to say I was full) I made 16 mushrooms and had plenty of stuffing left for Sunday dinner I stuffed chicken breasts with the stuffing like another reviewer said. I still have to find something to do with the rest but I'd eat that filling on crackers really. Thanks Gary great mushroom recipe.",
