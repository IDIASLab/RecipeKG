I pounded my chicken down a bit and poked it with a fork then put everything into a ziploc bag and let it go all day turning it once in a while. The chicken was moist full of flavor with a nice kick from the pepper. I dare say even \"Simon and Garfunkel\" would approve. Thanks for a great recipe Pam-3BoysMama!",

The other thing I did was to marinate it only for three hours! Next time I will add another jalapeno and marinate the chicken overnight. Even with these modifications the chicken was absolutely delicious. I had kosher chicken pieces from Trader Joe's and because they were big pieces I baked them in all the marinade for about half an hour before placing them on the grill for finishing (learned that trick from Melinda Lee our local talk show host) so they didn't burn. Juicy perfect chicken was the result. We may not be able to wait until dinner for the leftovers! Thanks Pam.",
