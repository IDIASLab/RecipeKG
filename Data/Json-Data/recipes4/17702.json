The submitter also mentioned in the footnotes to skip step 3 in the recipe if you wanted a stronger herb flavor and so I skipped step 3. This turned out really good. I can't wait to try it with other herbs. I do think if you plan on leaving the herb in and not straining it out that you might want to cut back to 2 tablespoons.",
