        "description": "This recipe was made every Christmas Eve for dinner. It will always be a favorite of mine because it truly reminds me of family and of Christmas. The most important step in this recipe is the browning; it is what determines your gravy. You must brown this meat until it is very dark, but not burned. The browner the meat, the better the gravy. Take your time, and brown on medium to medium-low heat. My father is from a small town in Bavaria called Hof, and my mother is from Gelsenkirchen, which is in northwestern Germany. My paternal oma (grandma) made this with pickles and my maternal oma without the pickles. I preferred it without, even though I love pickles.",

We have a German butcher nearby so it was easy for me to purchase the rouladen meat they tenderized it as well so I did not need to pound it out. I doubled the recipe since it is a bit of work and I could freeze the leftovers for next time. I agree with Ingrid no pickles my Omi never used. I added mushrooms beef Better than Bouillion and garlic to the gravy. Instead of simmering on the stove I placed the rouladen and gravy in my slow cooker to cook on low for the day as I needed to go out.
