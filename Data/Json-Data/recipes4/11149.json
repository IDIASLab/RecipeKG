I used ghee instead of oil, because I had it & love it. Following the lead of other reviewers, I about tripled the curry powder (which was old--need to buy fresh), doubled the onion and the Worcester sauce, added salt & pepper to the chicken. My orange turned out to be old, too, and the zest, or something, made the dish kind of bitter. I added a little orange juice & a dollop of sweet orange marmalade. Added raisins, which tasted great but didn't seem to add much to the dish as a whole. And I threw in some cinnamon and ground fenugreek. There was maybe not enough juice for that much rice, but it tasted really good! Next time, fresher ingredients!",
