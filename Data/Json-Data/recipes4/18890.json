I used vanilla almond milk my choice of a sugar substitute is always Truvia and this recipe was calling my name. Not only do I love the nutritional breakdown the thing I liked the most about this drink is that the coffee and chocolate flavors share equally without one dominating the other. Creamy mocha-coffee flavor and with a little dollop of whipped cream it s almost like dessert. Very very nice and refreshing. This reviewer is an Allrecipes Allstar.

I used 1/2 c of coconut milk and skipped the hot water. I thought it was sweet enough without adding the packet of sweetner. I didn't mix a whole 2 T of chocolate syrup but just swirled some in the glass and then topped the drink with some whipped cream and added another swirl of chocolate syrup.

I liked that the drink was low calorie and didn't feel one bit guilty drinking it. I used skim milk because I am allergic to soy. I don't know if it makes a difference but I did let the cocoa cool down before I made the drink. Cherries and some low calorie Cool Whip didn't hurt either! A great drink on a hot day!
