Also, Instead of rolling the mixture into logs, we roll them into 2\" balls.   When then potato dumplings come out of the boiling water, we cover them with saut\u00e9ed onions and a little melted butter. This is a must at our holidays meals!",

What I noticed was that the dough was super sticky and not being familiar with this type of dumpling I wasn't sure it was supposed to be that way so I added more flour... a lot more flour. Now I don't know if it made a difference that I only had the quick cook farina. The dumplings were good... but a little soft and they needed more salt.",
