I also added less seasoned salt, using about 1 T of Mrs. Dash's Southwest Chipotle, along with celery seed instead of celery salt.  Near the end of cooking, I also added in fresh broccoli.

The prep time either needs to be changed 1 hour or instead of using the crockpot to make the base, do it in a pot on the stove and then transfer to the crockpot.  I started in the crockpot, saw that it was going to take more like 1-1.5 hours and moved over to the stove.  Followed the recipe exactly and then transferred back to the crockpot before adding the potatos, etc.  2.  This is just an opinion issue really, but 1 T of crushed red pepper flakes made for a REALLY spicy potato soup.  Next time (and I will make it again) I will probably cut that in half.  All things considered, it is a very tasty and simple potato soup and I love how it starts carmelizing around the edges of the crockpot as it cooks - SO yummy and pretty!  Thanks for the recipe!!!",

When the potatoes were done, I did a quick mash with my potato masher, then I added in the bacon, one cup of fat free evaporated milk (my soup was thick enough already so I did not need the flour), a quarter cup of sour cream, the cheese, and a pinch of salt. After tasting it, I added my own personal touches (I sauteed some green onion with a mess of minced garlic in a little butter and threw that in with chives, hot pepper sauce, onion/garlic powder). Good recipe for soup that I could bend a bit and make more personal to me, lighter so I could enjoy without a lot of guilt, nevermind it was super cheap to make both on the food budget AND heating bill. This'll be lunch for the next couple days for my husband and I and we'll both enjoy this a great deal.",

I decreased the salt and added several whole stalks of celery for flavor (with leaves) while cooking and removed before serving.
