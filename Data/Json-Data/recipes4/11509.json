                "reviewBody": "Dick fine job! There are Italian Beef's then there are \"Chicago style\" Italian Beefs. Yours i would classify as Chicago style. I also use beef broth instead of water. In Chicago from where i was raised & just returned from the only topping you would get are either sweet peppers or Giardinera (hot). No mushrooms or any of that other stuff but thats perfectly ok for each individual preferences. When it comes to Chicago style Italian Beef's im just a purist as all. For the people who said rump is too tough you first roast to no more than medium! That way when you slice the meat I should say SHAVE it does not crumble. That degree of doneness has nothing to do with tenderness. After cooling(important cause hot meat crumbles)inserting the shaved meat in the Au Jus the redness will dissapear. Do not waste the x-tra on beef tenderloin. Rump or top round or sirloin tip will be just fine as well as eye of round although eye of round is NOT the tenderloin! Dick out of all the Beef joints in Chi-Town Al's is probably tops but then again it's all a personal preference. For all of the people out there \"ad libb'ing\" a Chicago style Italian Beef they have to know what an original really is & how it's served! Sort of like in Philly at Gino's or Pat's. Cheese Whiz or American Cheese. Thanks for letting these folks in on a Chicago staple.",

                "reviewBody": "Thank  you!  You should rename this one the ONLY REAL Italian Beef Sandwich Recipe!   We also moved away from the city of Chicago, and couldn't believe what they were passing off as \"Beefs\" in our new locale; shredded or loose meat with only a hint of seasoning, and carrots!  AAAGH! I came up with this method too after trial and error.I also use flavoring in the water added to the roasting pan, usually a little Worcestshire and a teaspoon of ready-to-use beef bouillon.  We  use a whole beef tenderloin, mostly for ease of slicing, so that we have enough for a big party or extra for the freezer.  My recipe calls for an herb/spice rub, with an eight cup each basil, oregano and parsley in dried form.  A dash or two of dried diced onion, crushed red pepper as  hot as  you like, and salt and pepper to taste.  Put on half of this before inserting the garlic and half after.  An easy way of doing the garlic is to make shallow scorings lengthwise down the tenderloin and then pat in minced garlic from a jar.  Sometimes we use a third to a half jar, depending on the size of the roast.  Proceed as you do with Dick's recipe, but with a whole tenderloin (sometimes called eye of round)  you might need longer for the larger size -- we usually leave it in the oven for 4 hours.  The first time we used the recipe, we put it in a roaster for a 70-person grad party, and it was the most requested entree, around 12 pounds completely gone right down to the gravy.\nHope the \"tweaks\" will help..Salute!",
