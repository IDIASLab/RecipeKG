It was the perfect blend of red and green to appear festive and I added feta cheese as someone else suggested and it was the perfect touch! Even my daughter who had never heard of lentils before raved about it. I did have to exclude the garlic because that is a migraine trigger for me but it had plenty of flavor regardless. I will definitely be making this again and not just during the holidays!!",
