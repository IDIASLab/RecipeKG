I sauteed 1/2 an onion and 2 sliced garlic cloves in the oil for a couple of minutes, then added the broccoli. I topped my second serving with a little fresh grated parmesan cheese. This recipe is a great way to prepare frozen broccoli. I had intended on not buying any more frozen broccoli because I usually wind up throwing it out whether it's been cooked or has grown old in the freezer. Now that I've found a good way to prepare it, I will buy more.",
