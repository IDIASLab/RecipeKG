I discovered it 6 years ago on Allrecipes and I've made it several times as a nice alternative to traditional tuna casserole. This time I happened to have on hand some pre-cooked frozen baby carrots so that is what I used in lieu of a package of frozen carrots. I also like the use of canned sliced potatoes I think they add something different to the dish. I simply made one layer of each ingredient no need to make multiple layers of each. One suggestion I'd like to make however is to lightly season each layer as you go or else you'll end up tasting all the salt pepper and paprika on the top layer.",
