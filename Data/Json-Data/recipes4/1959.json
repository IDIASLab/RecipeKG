Baked for 15 min. in preheated 425 oven.

I baked the potatoes at 425 for the time mentioned pushed them aside and dropped the temp to 325 (since my chicken had been cooked earlier) and returned it to the oven until heated through. I also used dried chives in place of the cilantro I didn't have on hand and also used Italian blend of cheeses in place of the Mexican blend. My husband and I LOVED it and I plan to keep this and make it for family and friends. Thanks Kellly!!",

I've up'ed it to a 5 and wanted to re-review but I see no way to just delete an old review so I'll just add to it. The original: I liked this as is. I didn't have Mexican cheese and used a combo of Jack mozarella & Colby. Otherwise it was made as is including temperature cooking times etc. And I thought the chicken was fine and unlike others the potatoes seemed to tend to overcook. Perhaps I cubed mine smaller? I made it a second time got lazy & didn't use the foil and it didn't turn out as well. I think potatoes do work well in foil. I liked that I could do everything in the oven and not cook anything ahead of time. New additional comments: This time I had a Mexican combo and that may have made a difference. I taste-tested and rather wondered why I'd even given it a 4 but it was much better as a whole put-together dish eating chicken & potatoes together. I think the butter is necessary both in terms of allowing the potatoes to get cooked (and I stirred them) and to make them tender. My oven temp is right on and I think these times work but big chunks vs cubed will take longer. It also doesn't specify a size for the potatoes and mine were probably about 5 oz give or take.",

It was delicious and it doesn't have to be so unhealthy either. Here's what I did differently. I used about a pound of yukon gold potatoes tossed them with 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil about 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt. Then added about 3 tablespoons of chopped fresh cilantro. I followed the baking directions then added the chicken breasts about 1 pound total each breast half sliced in half again so they were thin. I melted 1 tablespoon of butter added about 2 tablespoons of cilantro and squeezed half a lime in. This I brushed on the chicken. Baked again. Took it all out poured 1/4 cup salsa over the chicken (cherry salsa yum!) then topped with about 1/4 cup of cheese...it doesn't need much because everything else makes it so good! With those changes it comes out to about 340 calories per serving (of 4) which is much better than the original. Perfect easy and fast to assemble.",
