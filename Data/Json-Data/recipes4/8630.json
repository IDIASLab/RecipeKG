When I was looking for the perfect soup for the rainy week of weather we were getting I found this. It probably saved his co-workers alot of grouchiness. I used Johnsonville brats as they are his favorite. I also left half the skins on the potatoes to give it some depth and contrast. The garlic and onions were crushed and minced instead of processed to keep the cellular walls intact to preserve the flavor(over processing can break the cell membrane and chenge the flavors). Served with a crusty bread and garden salad its easier than waiting in line for 30mins at Olive Garden and just as fulfilling.",

As I said before definite keeper. I used turkey kielbassa this time peeled and run through the food processor and a little more pepper because kielbassa isn't spicy also added an extra chicken bouillon cube to the water. I always use white onion because I think the red gives it a weird colour. To make it true potato soup you have to run it through the blender or take a hand or stick blender to it. Otherwise it's just potatoes in stock.",

I also chopped up a small buch of kale to make it even closer to the restaurant recipe. I'm so glad i foudn this one as it is definitely a keeper for us!",
