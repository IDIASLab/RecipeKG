Plus they are a lot cheaper to make. I used the round cookie cutters for the first ones but it was a big pain so after that I just poured them onto the skillet into as round of a shape as possible which was pretty easy to do because they don't really spread out. I also used almond milk instead of regular milk because that is all we have. You couldn't even tell. They tasted great plain with butter with jam with eggs benedict and with a fried egg bacon and cheese sandwich. I will be making these often!",

I had to use almond milk because that is what I had on hand but everything else was per the recipe. These cooked up beautifully! Fluffy...dense and moist like an English muffin. So good with butter or in my case apple butter. I will make these again but I will experiment with quinoa flour (for more protein) and maybe cinnamon and cranberries. The only \"trouble\" I had was that I didn't have an electric griddle so I had to guage my temps on the stove top using a griddle pan. While they came out wonderully I had to really watch them because if they stove heat is too high it will brown too quickly and not cook through completely. With some trial and error I was able to figure out what worked on my stove. Lastly I used both rings and \"free form\" and both came out great. I think size-wise using only 2 tablespoons per crumpet worked for me. Advice if you are using rings try to use ones with handles as they get pretty hot and can be awkward to pick up with an oven mitt.",

We are doing an English Afternoon Tea for 8th graders after reading Great Expectations and I'll be cooking these fresh on an electric griddle during the event. Thanks a bunch for the recipe! UPDATE 2/26/17: I did buy crumpet rings and they do support the batter to give you that high rise you want for crumpets but you can easily use small tin cans with both ends removed. I found that a little butter dripped in around the rings while they were cooking helped with ring removal. The electric griddle gave that low even temperature that prevents burning on the bottom. I used small tongs to remove the rings as they do get hot. Between 2-3 Tbs of batter each worked for me and according to British sites these aren't supposed to be split like English Muffins. You eat them whole with clotted cream and lemon curd if you want to go with tradition. Recipes for the toppings are available online as well and also worked out well.",
