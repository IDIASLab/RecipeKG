I had two pounds of meat and the only way to brown all of it is to do it a little at a time and take it out. The recipe should say that. I also wanted it to be a complete meal so I added frozen corn and a half of a can of drained black beans. I didn't bother with the corn starch and water but I did add a cup of chicken broth. With the flour on the meat the sauce came out just right to serve over rice. My cilantro is slow to grow this year and the fricken store was out so I used the stuff in a tube. I was surprised.
