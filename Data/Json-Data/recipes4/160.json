This ice cream stays relatively soft in the freezer (if there's any left over, that is) so you don't have to get it out ahead of time to let it soften. DELICIOUS! (Update: I tried it today with caramel sauce instead of chocolate -- scrumptious. Can't wait to try strawberry ice cream topping -- or even . . . well the choices are endless now.)",
