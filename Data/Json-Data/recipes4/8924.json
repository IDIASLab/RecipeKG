I took the dough out of the freezer the night before and let it thaw on the kitchen counter. I then took a ceramic cereal bowl from my kitchen coated it with butter and lined it thickly with provolone cheese slices (mozzarella would work too) so there were no gaps. I made the filling as described using sweet Italian sausage mushrooms onions and diced green peppers. I only put pepper in half of the filling since I can't eat highly acidic foods (it was good with or without). I then then put the filling in the bowls with the cheese and spread the dough over the top. If you stretch the dough a thin over the top and just let the excess hang over the side it makes a nice thick crust when you flip it over. I also brushed some butter on top but you could use olive oil or an egg wash to help brown it. I put the bowls straight onto a pan right into the oven and cooked until browned. Then I flipped it right onto a plate ran a spoon around the edge and pulled the bowl off the top (you can also put an upside-down plate directly on top of the pizza hold them together and then flip the whole thing over to make it easier).",
