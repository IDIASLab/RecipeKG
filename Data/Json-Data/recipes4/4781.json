My daughter has a peanut allergy and many store bought granola bars have peanut flour. So I tried these and we fell in love with the taste and simplicity! I make a double batch individually cut and bag them and stick them in the freezer. I do not use the parchment paper as a liner but do use it to push them down firmly into the pan. I also have used a super-easy no cook recipe on here for Sweetened Condensed milk which works fabulously if you don't have it on hand. I only had old-fashioned oats and did not miss the quick-cooking oats. I have tried all sorts of variations such as chocolate chip and cinnamon raisin. Thanks for a fabulous recipe that has become a staple in our house!",

I took these to a group function and was given many compliments. My husband has requested we have them with breakfast every day. I omitted the condensed milk for one batch and tried using peanut butter and honey. I think it cooked too long because they were really crunchy.
