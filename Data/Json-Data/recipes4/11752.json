It is VERY important to use Cream of Coconut (which is sweetened) and not Coconut Milk (which is unsweetened).  I think this is why other reviewers claimed this dessert was too tart.  I added a cup of sugar after freezing, but before hardening and even this could not save the flavor.  Will try again with the right ingredients.",

I read that it's best for all ingredients to be chilled well so we chilled down the lime juice and coconut cream and we used ice water. We also added 2 teaspoons of light rum - I read that alcohol reduces iciness in the final product so we tried it. We ran the Cuisinart for 30 minutes resulting in a smooth creamy soft serve and froze the rest in individual containers. I have to tell you we took the just-made sorbet which was rich and creamy -not too sweet not too tart- and dropped into into a tall cold glass of Vanilla Coke with ice cubes then stirred with a straw to make the most incredible float! It creamed and frothed up in the glass. Delicious and decadent. This is now our favorite dessert hands down. An adult version of course is quite nice with more light rum in it. I just tasted the sorbet that froze and ripened overnight and it has a wonderful creamy texture not icy. It also has the same sweet-tart taste as yesterday so it did not sweeten appreciably as I read that it might. As mentioned by another reviewer it does melt quickly especially if it's hot in your kitchen. Did I mention this was our first recipe using our beautiful new red Cuisinart? Couldn't have picked a better recipe as our first. Footnote: Just topped out pancakes with this. Sinful!",
