Timing will really all depend on how thick the thighs are and how much you 'browned' them, especially since they are stuffed with raw sausage, you want to make sure the temperature reaches 170*.  \n\nmy husband liked this and so did friends who tried it using these recommendations.\n\nServed with jasmine rice and garlic bread.",

The things I changed were to use 3 hot and 3 sweet sausages (personal preference), I used a casserole dish with a lid, and I used a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes so we had more stuff to spoon over the chicken. I think the covered dish ensured that the sausage cooked thoroughly and the onions got nice and soft. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I cooked 4 chicken thighs stuffed with sausages in my slow cooker on a bed of carrots okra and onions. I cookd it for about 7 hours until the sausages were cooked through.

The sausage-wrapped thighs need to be browned first - they were an unappetizing/anemic-looking white.  I cooked it for 1 hr. 15 minutes just to ensure that the sausage was cooked thoroughly.  Even with the extra cooking time, the onions remained crunchy. (Perhaps if you choose to saute the chicken in some oil to brown it, the onions could be added to soften them up a bit.) Decent flavor, nice idea, but not so great that I would make it again.",

I used the diced tomatoes (can with oregano basil etc.) and for more sauce used Goya tomato sauce (I like the flavor of this sauce).
