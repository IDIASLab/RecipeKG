Less might be more. Instead of Rice Krispies I used the granola cereal I had on hand which has candied ginger in it. That added a nice depth of flavor to the brownies. (I didn't use 3 c. though; just a half cup or so. A full cup would prob. have been fine.) I used the tip of another reviewer to sprinkle on marshmallow layer instead of stirring into chocolate mixture. Better to do right after spreading the marshmallow mixture while it's more sticky from being warm. I also used semisweet chocolate.",

First I added slightly more peanut probably--I didn't feel like getting the cup measure dirty so I approximated. Second I pretty much doubled the amount of rice krispies called for in the recipe. After adding the specified amount the peanut butter/chocolate concentration was too high. This also seems to have improved the ratio of the rice krispy portion to the rest of the dessert.",
