I like to add a bit (1 tsp?) chili powder and fresh 2 cloves garlic when cooking the meat. I cook the noodles almost as directed but I generally don't add much water actually usually use beef or veggie broth. Use enough liquid to barely cover and with a little creative poking you can get all the noodles in the liquid. I then cover with foil (or lid) and bake about 30-40 minutes. I also mix half the cheese in the mixture and sprinkle the remaining on top toward the end. My children HATE orange cheese so I general end up using mozzerella unless I luck out and find white cheddar. I use whole wheat elbow noodles and low fat cheese to make this a nice healthy meal.",

Next time I think I'll use a little more beef a little more corn and a little less noodles. I'm also going to try cooking the noodles separately then adding them to the mix when it's time to transfer it to the baking dish; it seems you throw out a lot of flavoring with the excess water you have to drain after cooking the noodles as described in the recipe. I wonder how this would be using Mexican stewed tomatoes and adding a little taco seasoning to the beef. It seems there are endless ways to \"tweak\" this to suit your family's tastes.
