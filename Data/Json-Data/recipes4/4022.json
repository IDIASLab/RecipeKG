I did reduce the seasoned salt to 1/2 teapoon because of a lot of reviews that said it was salty and I think it was perfect. Also, I didn't bother to pre cook the bacon out of laziness, lol, but it cooked up fine in the oven. Other than that I kept everything the same. I will definately be using this recipe again.....and again-YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",
