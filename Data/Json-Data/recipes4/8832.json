I added a whole chopped jalepaeno to give it a kick (warning it had a kick but really complemented the mango) used fresh chopped red pepper instead of the flakes for more taste and texture and did not add the beans (it didnt need it). I also replaced the oil with fresh lemon juice to keep the fish light and healthy it worked well. Finally instead of tortillas I served the whole fish fillets on a plate with huge piles of salsa on top and with a side of grilled veggies (use the rest of the red pepper and add some yellow pepper and onion or your grilled veggie of choice). Delicious and Healthy.",
