To cut down on the grease, I used half a cup of cheddar cheese and half a cup of monteray jack cheese.(cheddar cheese is very oily).  As far as the potatoes go, first I pre-cooked the meat with onions, fresh garlic, and chili sauce (replacing the tomato sauce).  I then refrigerated the meat for about an hour.  Then I sliced the potatoes very thin and cooked the whole thing together for 1hr. The first half hour, I kept it covered with aluminum foil, and then took it off the last half hour.  The potoes came out very tender.  My husband and kids loved it.",

Good plain comfort food but if you are looking for something with more zing you may want to add a bit of spice or chili sauce to the meat when you cook it. Make sure to cut the potatoes really thin too or else you'll be cooking it for a long(er) time!",

This is an Australian Recipe and we don't have a high fat content in our mince steak so we don't need to drain it. I apologise to o/s cooks I did not realise this when I posted the recipe and yes Ketchup is Tomato Sauce in Australia. I think this recipe is quite versatile you can add whatever herbs etc you like you could even spice it up with a bit of chili powder! That's the fun of cooking (I think) experimenting! Enjoy!",
