Instead of soft tofu I used firm and I didn't have Szechuan peppercorns so I used Chinese five spice instead. The flavour was not bad but there was almost no sauce at all. Totally unlike the ma po tofu I used to get in Vancouver (though I knew the tofu texture would be different). With a bit more sauce this would be closer to a 4 star (and next time I'll add no salt as it was quite salty as is).",
