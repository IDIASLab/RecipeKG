First I used 1 lb of cubed cooked ham I used 1 14.5oz can pre-cooked wild rice (undrained) and instead of using 1 can of cream of chicken I used 2 can cream of potatoe. This allowed my to skip step 1 in the recipe and just mix everything in the pot and heat through melting the cheese when warmed. Although I wil try this with the other meat recommendations this turned out great for us!!",
