It would make a nice side dish or great burrito fillings (we used it for burritos topped with shredded cheese and sour cream).  I make my own yellow rice (1 1/2 cups rice, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1 tsp onion flakes, 1/2 tsp garlic powder)  I put all ingredients both the recipe and my rice recipe in the rice cooker and it came out perfect!  My 9yr old LOVED it.  I agree with others that some fresh cilantro would dress it up; however, I made it as is and it was great.  This is also a PERFECT pantry/emergency dish since everything is shelf stable.",

I did have to add an extra cup of water to the 8 oz. of rice I boiled which seemed to smoke up quite a bit. I'm guessing that this was due to the olive oil? Maybe next time I will make the rice according to the box directions and proceed with the recipe as written. As with anything you cook and add spices to I anticipate this tasting better on day 2.",
