There is no need to brown your sausage and onions and then take the time and trouble to remove them from the IP. Start with step 2 and just set that mixture aside until step 1 is done. The other reason I did not rate this a 5 is because I saw no point in draining your tomatoes and beans just to add water. Chop your stewed tomatoes as the recipe calls for but then just stick them back in the can with the juices. Drain the juice off of your great northern beans because they are thicker and murkier than the cannellini beans. Swap out the water in the recipe with the tomato juice and the cannellini juice. It only makes sense. I'm not a big canned green fan but this recipe is to die for AND so easy! Thank you for sharing!",
