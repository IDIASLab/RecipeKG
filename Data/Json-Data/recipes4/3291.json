You have to love blue cheese and it definitly needs a night in the fridge to let the flavors mingle. I roll mine as soon as I mix the cheese up. Then I wrap it in plastic wrap, add a red bow to tie it up, put it in the fridge overnight and its ready for transport to anyones house. Thanks for posting this.",
