This is almost it! These are my changes: I only had fresh spinach so I wilted it in the micro (one-minute intervals...man that stuff shrinks!). Mixed it with blue cheese (for hubby I did shredded mozzarella and a bit of light sour cream cause he dislikes blue cheese and I just had the mozz on hand). I then pounded my chicken breasts spread the cheese mixture on one side and rolled it up wrapping two whole raw bacon slices around it. Didn't even need toothpicks. Pretty easy to prepare too (I prepared the cheese/spinach mixture ahead of time and put in in some tupperware in the fridge). I skipped the browning with flour and olive oil- as the bacon cooked in the oven it took care of that part. I loves this dish! Tasted hubby's and it was good although not as good as mine because I LOVE blue cheese!",

I rolled them up and wrapped two slices of partially cooked bacon over each. I didn't bother with flouring them or browning them in a skillet just simply placed them in a baking dish at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Moist and tender SO flavorful and pretty on the plate too!",

The cheese I used was one that I found in the gourmet cheese section at the market. It was a layered brick of blue cheese/old cheddar. The cheddar really helped keep the flavor mild. I think using the full amount of only blue cheese would have been overpowering like others have mentioned. The chicken breasts I used were de-boned but still had the skin on. I put the stuffing underneath the skin then sauteed in a pan (without the flour). I finished these off in the oven. I will make this again.",

I used a good Danish bleu cheese and the flavor was very strong. Overall it was tasty but too overpowering almost tongue numbing. I think I will adjust this with about half the spinach and 1/4 cup of blue cheese. I would also add some sauteed onion and garlic to the filling. As written I would give it 3 stars but I think with a little tweaking it could easily be a 5 star recipe. It has potential.",
