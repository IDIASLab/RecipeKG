Delicious, easy, simple ingredients. Can't ask for more.  **UPDATE** Well, here it is late 8/2011 and he's here visiting.  He specifically asked that we make this today. Heading to store for another brick of cream cheese. Doing only \"half\" of this recipe is  a complete waste of time in my house!!  When kids ask for it by name and dig in with glee with their celery sticks, how can you say no to that kind of celebration!!!",

                "reviewBody": "At first, I thought this tasted a lot like beer. I scaled the recipe all the way to 7 servings to try out the taste only. I used whipped cream cheese, because it was all I had. I did use a darker beer, that has a stronger taste, but the recipe didn't specify. Once I let it sit in the fridge for 24 hours, and then dipped pretzels in it, the flavors blended together well. The beer just enhanced the cheese flavors instead of dominating it. It does go great with pretzels. However, I would definitely make it the night before so the cheese has time to absorb the beer and blend right. It will also be much thicker by then and the right consistency for dipping.",

I didn't use any seasoned salt and I'm not a fan of cayenne but I did want a little \"kick \" so I added a healthy dose of horseradish. I used a little more than 1/2 cup of Terminal Gravity IPA and it was good straight out of the processor workbowl. I got some Snyder's giant pretzel rods as a go-with...can't wait to taste it after it's had a chance to meld. Thanks for a keeper! 10/8/11 - 24 hours later. I'm not going to change the rating but I will do a couple of things differently next time. First I was surprised by how thick it was so that means I'll add more beer. Second I couldn't really taste the horseradish at all so I'll be adding more of that too. It was very good but just a wee bit too \"ranchy.\" I took it to a party in the bread bowl and got lots of compliments...nice about not having to worry about taking the bowl home!",
