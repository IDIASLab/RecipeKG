If usually pan-fry the salmon or bake it because I think it has more flavor. To add season I use parsley, roasted garlic, and when I want an asian kick, I use minced ginger, soy sauce and cilantro and panko instead of regular bread crumbs. A must try and never skimp by using canned salmon. Salmon is so easy to find now and if you shop around you can usually find it for a very reasonable price.",
