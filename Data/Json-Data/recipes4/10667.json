I added 2 small carrots shredded 2 celery stalks chopped small 2 cans chunky tomato sauce with italian seasoning and 2 cans white beans. I double the spices and add only 2 cups of water. I don't ever add the pasta directly to the soup. I add it to each bowl as I am ready to serve because pasta will continue to cook in the soup and you will have mush. If you have left overs they freeze well - without the pasta.",

I'm a retired chef of 40 years & did much italian cuisine This is similar to the way I use to make it except I used fresh herbs cut back on the garlic & used real chiken stock.

I used to live in Utica NY which has a very large Italian population so I enjoyed dishes like Pasta Fagioli from lunch take-outs. This recipe has more bacon than I remember probably because those places were trying to cut back on food costs but more bacon is not a bad thing! Be sure to taste before adding salt. I like salty food but didn't need to add any. It was even better the second day when I heated it up for lunch. Thanks for a healthy and tasty recipe!",

The first time I followed the recipe and instructions to a \"T\" the second time around I made a few changes (for the better IMO). My rating is based on the original which is a good soup with a nice flavor. My second version I added 2 stalks diced celery and 2 peeled diced carrots to the onion/bacon stage. I even used a couple more cloves of garlic since the flavor mellows when cooked like this and we LOVE garlic I mashed all of the cooked cloves with a fork and a little of the broth and mixed it all right back in. I also used whole wheat penne since we don't eat white pasta or rice in my house. I also used 8 cups chicken broth in place of the 2qt. water and 2 boullion cubes. If served immediately this soup has a nice broth (especially with the can of tomato sauce) the leftovers however become a casserole a delicious casserole nonetheless. A little water to thin it back to soup does the trick and the leftovers are delicious! Thanks for submitting!",
