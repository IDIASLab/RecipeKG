I did, however change the preparation.  I am not sure why the recipe calls for the fish to be cooked in water before adding to the recipe.  This really isn't necessary; the whole recipe can be prepared in one pot.  Saute the onion in olive oil in a large pot or dutch oven and proceed with the recipe as written, combining in the same pot.  Add the fish about 15 minutes before you want the stew to be ready.  It will cook in the broth.  Be sure to include the full amount of liquid given in the recipe",

Cooking the fish separately seemed to be extra work for no real reason. To compensate for the fact that cooking it separately makes fish stock I added some dashi (Japanese fish bouillon) to the 2 cups of water. I also added some cooked rice I had laying around in the fridge. The rice made it very filling and tasted good. Loved the almonds! They added an unusual and interesting flavor and texture. I like food that's fairly heavily spiced so I played around with additional spices and upped the amount of garlic and paprika.",
