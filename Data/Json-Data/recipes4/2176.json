I did make a few changes - added noodles (because my guys eat ALOT), more cheese, about a 1/8 tsp of garlic powder and used only peas instead of the mixed veggies.  My filling was a bit dry - possibly due to addition of the noodles - so I added some milk and it was perfect.  The crescent rolls did overlap a lot, so much so that I couldn't use them all.  Next time I will drape them over the edge of the pie plate with the points outside, then add the filling, then cover the top with the points.",
