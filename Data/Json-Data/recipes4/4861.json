I cooked rice separately and served it over rice.  I also made it first without chicken.  I later added it.  I omitted carrots and sweet potato only because I did not have any but they would have been great.  I also only had creamy peanut butter.  What makes this recipe stand out is the blend of seasoning.  They are the best!  The aroma was amazing.  2 friends ended up eating over because they were intoxicated by the smell of my kitchen while cooking this!  The flavor was wonderful and I am excited to make it again, closer to the original recipe.  I really feel the blend of spices make this recipe unique and stand out!",

I didn't add the rice to mine because I don't need the extra carbs and I also didn't add sweet potato because I forgot to buy them at the store. Oh I also skipped browning the chicken and vegetables because after 10 hours in the crock pot I knew everything would cook down and meld together. I loved the combination of spices. EDIT: I made this recipe again last night. I had some random veggies in the fridge I wanted to use up (celery broccoli zucchini) so I chopped them up and threw them in. Also I made with water instead of stock because I didn't have any. ALSO I found out at the last minute we were out of peanut butter so we added almond butter--I think it turned out just as good!",

                "reviewBody": "Wonderful. I used shredded chicken from a small farm-raised whole chicken, which is probably equivalent to two huge conventional breasts. I just threw the cooked chicken right into the crockpot,  no additional browning. I think just adding small bone-in pieces (browned) would be even better, so that the nutrients from the bones leach into the soup, and that's how I ate it in West Africa. I didn't add the cayenne or red pepper for my kids but it would have been great with them. I also used homemade chicken broth so it was not very salty, which we prefer, but most people would probably need to add salt if you don't use a salty broth. I also just served over rice instead of mixing rice in, as other reviewers suggested, and used creamy PB because I didn't have crunchy. I think the sweet potatoes are key - gives it sweetness to the tang and makes it very \"African\". I used to use the Groundnut Stew recipe from my tried and true \"More with Less\" cookbook, but I'm switching to this recipe. Thanks a lot - this is a wonderful recipe.",

The next issue is the fact that I left out one pepper 1 cup of carrots and the rice which would have used a substantial amount of liquid and this recipe still ended up as a very very thick stew even after adding 2 more cups of broth after the stated 3 cups! I'm so confused! I am an experienced cook and know what I'm doing.:) Anyone else have the same experience? Just curious.",
