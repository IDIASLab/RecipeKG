In neither did I use teff grains but used fonio grains instead the taste is similar. I used different seeds than written. Where both flours were very good I found that the brown teff flour had a much nuttier and toastier flavor than the white flour. I used soaked buckwheat groats in the brown teff version and dry buckwheat flakes in the white. The crunch of the whole groats is a plus here. I used sesame seeds and soaked quinoa too. If you keep with the ratios of the main mixture teff flour tapioca water your additions are infinite and don't interfere with cooking time. I cooked both at the same time on the same baking sheet in 37 minutes. What a lovely recipe thank you for sharing it with us.",

I will definitely make them again - nest time with all the  suggested ingredients except I'll again use raw pumpkin seeds.\nOh, I added a Tbl of dried minced onion, but  next time will increase the amount.\nThis is a great recipe because I can imagine also modifying it in many ways while still getting crispy crackers from it.",
