I would recommend serving with a dollop of sour cream on top. Also, save yourself the dishes and use only one pot- add ingredients in this order: celery, carrots, potatoes, then beets so that they are all equally as soft. Borscht shouldn't feel chunky, but rather melt in your mouth.",

For additional flavor I added beef base (i use organic). You HAVE to eat borsh with sour cream, it brings out the flavor. I grew up eating borsh and now I make it at least once a month.",
