I added 1/2 cup milk to the sauce - perfect, had no horseradish, so I added 1 tablespoon djon mustard and garlic to taste.  I also chopped the chicken, cut cooking time to just 40 mins.  The last 10 mins I put about a cup of grated cheese on top and it went brown and bubbly.  Excellent over rice! Even the picky 2 year old ate it (he loved the saucy chicken and rice)",
