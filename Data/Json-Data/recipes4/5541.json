However, the hubby and I both love curry so I experimented and came up with what I believe is a 5-star dish.  I used two cans of 13.5oz coconut milk, about 1/2 cup of chicken broth, about 1 cup matchstick carrots, diced yellow potatoes, 3 yellow onions diced, about 1 tblsp freshly ground black pepper, 1/4 cup plus 2 tblsp curry, 1 tblsp of chopped garlic and sea salt to taste.  I did not dice the chicken breasts since the slow cooker makes the chicken so tender.  The last hour I added the red bell pepper, about a 1 and half cups of sweetened flake coconut and the cornstarch which probably wasn't needed but did thicken it a bit more.  I then served it over white rice made with milk, water and butter.  These changes made this an awesome dish though probably not very low calorie.  However, the flavor was perfect and reminded me of a good vegetarian Vietnamese dish (basically veggies in a coconut broth).  I know I could have made this without the crock pot but am always looking for slow cook recipes to help with busy schedules.  Cook on Sunday, eat leftovers most of the week.  :)",

The only thing I changed was to use a can of chicken broth rather than 1 cup this way I had a lot more of the yummy gravy to enjoy with my naan.
