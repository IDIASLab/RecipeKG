I used Blue Agave syrup in place of the honey and was hoping it wouldn't ruin the recipe and it didn't, it worked well. I couldn't help myself and added 1/2 cup of sliced almonds. I didn't have flax meal and added nothing more because of it. I patted in down on the sheet and baked and cooled as instructed for a chunky texture. Perfect hint of chocolate that doesn't overtake the oatey wholesome goodness so it still tastes like granola and not a candybar. This is a keeper! Thanks CC for sharing.",

Heavy dose of fiber for the kids and they all love it, so I have kept these modifications each time I make it. We eat it in chunks and I'll sometimes mix it while baking for a finer texture and mix it in plain yogurt. My daughter even puts it in a splash of milk to eat it like cereal. Big hit here, and finding something that all three kids will love is no small feat, almost impossible.",

My daughter loves it as a snack on its own I add it to my yogurt and cereal for a delicious crunch and we all top our frozen yogurt with it when there is any left. I usually stick to the recipe except for the odd extra handful of chocolate chips. Also I watch the baking time fairly closely as I like it crispy but not overdone.
