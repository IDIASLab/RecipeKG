I topped the dish with some shredded mozzarella for the last 15 minutes - yum! Serve over or with rice... The end result was very similar to what I remember! Thanks for the recipe!",

I pulled the chicken out and kept cooking the vegetables up to the designated 1 1/2 hours but then the potatoes still weren't completely done. However the taste was excellent the chicken came out perfect my husband and I both loved it. Didn't feel like extra spices were needed I was glad I didn't \"tweak\" it any. I will experiment next time maybe pre-cook the potatoes a bit because this is well worth it! Thanks for the post.",

I find it tastes best when I use crushed red pepper combine oregano with the tomato paste and exclude the potatoes and pepperoncinis. I also dice the garlic. When we're feeling lazy we use stewed canned tomatoes to speed up the prep time and I always have the tomatoes chopped up as much as possible since I'm texture picky.
