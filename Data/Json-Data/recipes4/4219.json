I improvised a bit because I did not have all of the things listed. I used whole milk instead of half-and-half and I omitted the cayenne pepper because I was out. I was also reading another recipe that said to boil the shells in water and use that in the bisque so I used half-chicken broth and half of the crawfish \"stock\". SO GOOD! Next time I make this I will probably try using all \"stock\" and omitting the chicken broth. Once the soup was finished I pureed it to make the whole thing smooth and then added the crawfish meat.
