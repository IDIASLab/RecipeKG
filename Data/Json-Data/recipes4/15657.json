Usually I read through reviews before I'll try something, especially when it's for a big family dinner.  I decided to take the risk with this one.  ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  We used a top sirloin roast instead of a standing rib, but followed things pretty closely otherwise.  The meat was tender, juicy, and very flavourful.  The gravy I made with the drippings was amazing.  We loved it so much that we will be making it again later this week when we have different dinner guests.",

I found a fool-proof method that cooks it to a perfect medium rare center every time. Pre-heat oven to 500 degrees. Roast in oven at this temp for 5 minutes per pound, then turn oven off, do not open at all for two hours. No need to let it stand before carving when you take it out because it\u2019s already stood the last bit to return juices to the center.",

I have to say that I was concerned about brining such an excellent cut of meat in coffee but decided I would give it a try and I'm so glad I did. I followed the directions to a \"T\" and the roast came out PERFECT - medium rare so juicy melt in your mouth tender and so flavorful. (There was no hint of coffee in the cooked meat so don't be concerned about brining the meat in coffee). Our guests loved it and raved about it all through dinner and two friends asked me for the recipe so they could make it for two of their upcoming events. This recipe has been added to my \"favorites\" and will now be my \"go to\" recipe when planning a decadent elaborate fancy meal.",

I marinated it overnight and cooked it in a 375 oven until it registered medium well on the meat thermometer. I did not have time or patience to cook it per instructions provided ie turning the oven off for a period of time and then turning it back on to finish cooking the meat. I let it rest for about 20 minutes before carving and omg what a tender flavourful roast! I'll definitely be keeping this marinade for future!!!",
