After the big dog food scare, I didn't want to take chances so I tried to figure out a healthy recipe for them, something that had all the nutrients and fat they needed. This is what I came up with and my dogs absolutely loved it! The nice thing about this recipe is that it can be eaten by the humans as well.",

I think this recipe is great however I used ground turkey instead of the beef and cooked the brown rice with a homemade broth. I think if you wanted you could also add different vegetables. My recipe is one I cook on the stovetop but I liked the idea of individual cakes. My recipe also includes all of the ingredients here except I use sweet potatoes. My dogs loved this one as a change from their regular food. One of the great things about a homemade diet is you don't have to be so careful to wean the dogs on or off their standard food. My dogs digestive systems are so healthy that they never seem to have upset tummies.",

I used one of those big metal bowls (the ones that everyone has you know the ones) and had to make half at a time and even then it just barely fit without spilling raw meat all over the counter. Also it took way more than 2 hours... I'm going into my 4th hour as I type because I've been baking 18 at a time and the last should be the 4th batch. Maybe its the size of my pans. Great recipe though. This is just a fair warning since no one else has mentioned it. Just make sure you have a lot of time and patience or even just cut the recipe in half. I'll be feeding this to the new puppy I'm getting tomorrow!! 1-2 a day mixed with kibble should do it. Hope she likes it!!",
