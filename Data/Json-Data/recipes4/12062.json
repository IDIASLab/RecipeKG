Instead of the 2 tbsp of garlic powder I sprinkled garlic powder along with salt and pepper over the chops (so used less than 1 tsp total) then I rubbed in the minced garlic as called for into the chops. I then browned the chops as Mitzi8 suggested and then added the water and worchestershire sauce mixture along with 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar to the browned chops. While the chops were simmering I sauteed the mushrooms (doubled the amount) and onions in a small skillet in 2 tsp of butter and added them to the chops with about 5 minutes left in the cooking. The result was delicious - my husband gave it 'the highest stars.'",

They were not too salty,however, I think they were too PEPPERY and the Worcestershire was too prominent in my opinion. I baked an additional 20 minutes @375, after braising the second 10 minutes;due to my chops were really thick. They were juicy and the mushrooms were great, it was quick, and pretty good. Maybe if you added a little something sweet like balsamic vinegar or maple syrup it would of balanced out the flavor more. I will try again, doing that.",

I followed the measurements for dry spices as directed and used about 5 cloves of garlic and smothered them on one side of each chop after rubbing them down with the spices. I browned them first an sauted the onion rings & mushrooms in butter flavored cooking spray and tablespoon of butter as other reviewers suggested. Even though I think I slightly overcooked them the worchestire sauce mixture kept the chops moist. My husband and I really enjoyed these and will definately make again with more mushrooms and more sauce. I plan on slicing up the left over 2 chops and toasting them in a sandwich roll w/ more sauted onion mushroom bellpeppers and cheese! Thank You!!!",
