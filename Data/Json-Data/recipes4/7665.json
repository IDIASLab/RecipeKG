We did use some salt and ground pepper for more flavor when grilling.\nI didn't have lettuce but cheese and green onions made a great substitute. I would suggest some garlic and pepper to flavor the vegetables while simmering. We've been getting some summer like weather and already feels too hot to cook in the kitchen, so this was a perfect easy meal for a night like that.",
