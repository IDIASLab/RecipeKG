To start, you should soak your red kidney beans in cold water overnight. When you're ready to cook the peas, you would boil with it 1-2 cloves of garlic. Since the peas are presoaked, it should take approximately 45 mins to 1 hour to cook. After the peas is cook, you can add approximately 1/2-1 can of cocunut milk, 1 sprig of escallion, about 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 sprig of thyme, black pepper and seasoning salt (all purpose seasoning) to taste (about 1 teaspoon of each), 1 table spoon butter, 1 whole scotch bonnet pepper (for flavouring). You can add onion if you like, but it should be finely chopped. Allow that to boil for 2-3 minutes. Then you wash your rice, and add it to the mixture. Once the rice is brought to a boil, reduce your fire and allow it to simmer.  This should give you a much better version of the Jamaican Rice and Peas. I make it every sunday, and each time I make it for guests they absolutely love it.",

To get this recipe right you will need 2.5C of coconut milk, 2C of brown rice, the onion and seasoning levels are fine, you need to use canned or precooked kidney beans, and finally to make it not bland as so many have complained, you need to add about 3tsp of white sugar. Anyone who has ever had raw coconut compared to the refined stuff will know why... I'll try to get my brother's version of this recipe (as made in Belize) much better and post it!",

I poured in a can of lite coconut milk, some red pepper flakes, dried tyme, and some curry powder.  Then I added a can of kidney beans and the rice.
