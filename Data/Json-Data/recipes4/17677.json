His mother made this once a week at her deli and after trying it once I had a standing order to save me a plate every week. This is so healthy and delicious, and it's so simple to make. After she retired and closed her deli I had to search through several recipes and make my adjustments to get it to my liking. It has become a staple in my home.",

I added the spices to the onions and cooked till fragrant and added the garlic after and only cooked till soft (I was afraid it would overcook if I added it with the onions). I used white basmati rice. I liked this very much. Next time I will saute the carrots with the onions as they were a little mushy for my taste. I used the water I cooked my lentils in to keep the mixture from drying out. In order to do this quickly I started my lentils and after 5 minutes I started the rice. After the first 10 minutes of cooking the lentils I started sauteeing the onions so when the lentils were done it was all ready to combine and then serve.",

I made this with brown basmati rice, which makes the cooking simpler because the brown rice cooks as long and at the same time as the lentils, and gives it more of a nutty flavour.  Followed the advice of others: 1) fried up one diced onion until translucent, 2) added 1 cup brown lentils, 2 cups stock then 1 cup brown rice & 2 cups liquid, best with stock.  Added 1 tsp cumin, garam masala and 1/2 t cinnamon for some spicy sweetness, 3) brought to a boil and simmered low for 40 minutes.  No need for salt if there's some in the stock.  Served it with fried onions, a yogurt raita with cucumber and mint, and sprinkled some fresh chopped cilantro and smoked paprika over it.  Delicious! -- and better than any I've had at restaurants!",
