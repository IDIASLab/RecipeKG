I use my own tomato sauce (marinara) in this recipe which has saut\u00e9ed onions and garlic in it. You can add what ever you want to your liking. Meatloaf can be made out of any meat. I personally don't like Worcestershire sauce, so I don't use it, but feel free to add it. This is \"Italian\" turkey meatloaf which is why I don't use ketchup. (I am not a fan of ketchup either unless I am eating French fries) If ketchup is all you have or you want to top it with brown sugar (which was unheard of in my Italian family) feel free.",

I added minced onion and shredded carrot, used Italian bread crumbs with romano cheese, and like another reviewer, used Herbes de Provence instead of Italian seasoning.  Added a lot of depth but next time I`ll use a little less - forgot how much stronger it is!  The texture of the meatloaf was perfect, very moist although I did crank up the heat for the last 15 minutes.  Also made a sauce out of brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard and it was tasty.  My only complaint is how small it was.  Next time I`ll use 2 lbs per loaf AND make several of them to freeze!  Thanks for the great recipe!",
