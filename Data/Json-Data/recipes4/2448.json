He did say that it was too rich to eat a lot and suggested turning it into tiny turnovers for an appetizer. I only made one ingredient substitution, which was to use sour cream (added off the stove with the cheese) instead of heavy cream (didn't want to go to the store). I did have an issue with the recipe instructions. Putting the onion, bacon and mushrooms in the pan all at once resulted in the bacon staying quite unappetizingly flabby and pink and streaked with fat. I had to cook the mixture WAY longer to get the bacon to render most of the fat. I'd suggest cooking the bacon a few minutes, then adding the onion, cooking again for a bit and finally adding the mushrooms and cooking until they are done. Also, puff pastry rises and gets crisp better at 375 than the 350 the recipe calls for. I'd definitely recommend trying the recipe with puff pastry. The crispy lightness is really nice. ",

Like other reviewers, I used a pie crust (both top and bottom) in place of the puff pastry, and increased the filling amounts by half again to fill the pie (i.e., 15 oz of mushrooms, etc).  It was quite tasty and filling.  If using a pie crust, here is the baking time/temp I used:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees and bake for 40-50 minutes until golden.  Cover edges of pie with aluminum foil for the first 30 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!",
