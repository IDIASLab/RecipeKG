Only cover them with a damp towel for a few minutes.  Otherwise the pockets will seal themselves back up.\n6.  I experienced best baking success while using only one cookie sheet at a time.  Two sheets seemed to suck up too much heat and prevent the pocket from forming.\n\nThis is a really tasty recipe!!!",

That will immediately kill the yeast.  Experienced bread bakers would know this, but if you are new to yeast baking, you may not.  Therefore, that hinders this recipe.  However, if you make it past the yeast proofing stage, this is a nice pita bread.  I didn't have soy flour and I wanted a bread that would puff/rise a bit more, so I used 1 cup ww flour and 2 cups all purpose.  Next time I may use some wheat glutin with the recipe as written to see if that helps it rise.  Bakes up beautifully, and I did have pockets in some of my bread.  Does have a nice taste with the molasses and the wheat flour, but you could always sub honey or sugar instead.  Thanks!",

After making these, we filled them with pizza sauce, pepperoni, mushrooms and cheese and microwaved to make pizza pockets - even my 4 and 5 year olds loved them!\r\n\r\n*note* update on 4/26/05 - I made these exactly according to the recipe this weekend and they were PERFECT. The soy flour smelled a little different while forming the pitas, but the taste and texture were wonderful! I made 8 pitas out of this recipe - even used a ruler to measure them as I rolled them out to make sure they were right.",

I thought I had soy flour on hand then at the last minute discovered I didn't so I substituted rye flour and they turned out really good. I also made another batch alongside substituting bread flour for the soy. These puffed up really nicely but didn't make a pocket inside so I won't use bread flour again but even the flops tasted better than the ones from the grocery store!! Thanks for the easy recipe with simple ingredients! I have another batch going right now and I didn't even have to re-read the recipe.",
