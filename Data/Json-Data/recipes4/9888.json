Being Mexican myself and making this rice or eating it from relatives in Old Mexico, the recipe does not call for all that spice nor peppers, much less all that tomato sauce.  Less than 1 can is enough if you use tomato sauce.  And the rice is supposed to be sauteed with the onion in the oil.  It sounds good, but I don't think it's kid friendly.  It's just another Tex-Mex variation of the traditional recipe.",

Of course, I can't afford saffron, so I omitted it but other than that the ingredients were pretty normal and easy to find.  And no one was repulsed by green peppers, which the kids have a problem with every time we sit down to eat.",

I sauteed the peppers onions and garlic in butter then added the cooked rice and the remaining ingredients using just a little water. The chipotle chili powder I used is hotter than regular old chili powder so I used just 1/4 of the amount called for and it was plenty spicy for us. The saffron wasn't noticeable so I don't know that I would even bother to include it. I simmered this for just about 10 minutes or so just to meld the flavors. Unlike some of the other reviewers I'm not fussy about what you call this or whether or not it's authentic. What's important to me is that it tastes good - and it did.",
