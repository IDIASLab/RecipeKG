Real wild rice takes at least 50-60 minutes to cook so this recipe needs a variation/rice mix like; Uncle Ben's Long Grain AND Wild Rice. This way you can keep the simmering to 30 minutes. I recommend not using any flavoring packets and using low-sodium Cream of Mushroom soup. I used 2 cups chicken broth and later added another half cube while simmering (in lieu of flavor packet). It was delicious. Thanks.",

                "reviewBody": "Nice change of pace! I went out on a limb and made a few changes. I knew there would be a lot of flavor from the sausage so I figured dinner would turn out regardless. Another reviewer made the point that actual wild rice takes about an hour to cook so I started the wild rice (and chicken broth) in the rice cooker earlier than the rest of the meal. I added a cup of extra water and let it keep cooking longer than usual. I didn't have enough chicken broth and I think it showed through in the end result. That mistake I won't make again. In one skillet I cooked up finely diced chicken Maui onion and minced garlic with a tablespoon of olive oil. When that was partially cooked I added a cup of broccoli cut into smaller pieces than normal. In the other skillet I let the andouille sausage crisp up some. I omitted the mushrooms and mushroom soup because we don't care for mushrooms but I think they would have gone well in this dish. Also I was in the mood for something lighter than the cream soup would make. I added the rice to the chicken mixture with some reconstituted chicken bouillon to help it break up some. When that was a nice fluffy consistency again I added the rice and chicken into the sausage pan and mixed it up will. It turned out delicious with great color flavor and presentation!",
