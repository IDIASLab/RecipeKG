Made a few changes chopped walla walla onions instead of onion powder used 2 lbs of hamburger and 1lb of sausage also used the rings of walla walla onions to wrap the outside of the meatball then wrapped with bacon. Another item I added was milk I believe 1 cup. I saw this in another recipe and decided to try it. It was a great addition along with some Worcester Sauce and bar b que sauce(Sweet Baby Rays) 1 cup.
