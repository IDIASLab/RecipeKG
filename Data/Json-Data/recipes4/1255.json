I added some chopped celery to the onion & garlic and sauteed in olive oil until tender.  Then added 1/4 c. sliced mushrooms & sauteed a little longer.  Set aside the sauteed vegetables and make a roux in a separate saucepan with the flour & olive oil, and then add sherry wine (1/4 cup) to the broth and then milk (cook about 5 mins, continually stirring).  Follow the rest of my review below & you'll love it!\n\nWhen I reached the right consistency, I added frozen peas, chopped turkey, and freshly grated parmesan and asiago cheeses (or romano is good too).  I like linguine instead of spaghetti.  Add pepper and salt to taste.  Top with seasoned bread crumbs with melted butter on top and bake about 1/2 hour til bubbly.  Quite yummy!",

I also added about 1/2 t. garlic powder, a dash of pepper, and about 4 T. of sour cream.  I also cut the cooking time down to 40 minutes, and probably will cut it down even to 30 minutes so it's a bit more soupy.  This is a really delicious recpe, thank you so much!!  I will definitely make this recipe again & again.  My 2 year old daughter had two HUGE helpings of this.",

I did what others suggested and added a few things: first I saute'd some onions in olive oil then added some minced garlic added the turkey to heat it through added another tablespoon of olive oil with the flour and let it all cook until the flour smelled nutty then I added some homemade turkey stock instead of the chicken broth then the milk and the rest of the recipe. The only other thing I did different was that I added the butter in cubes all over the top of the dish then added the cheese on top and baked it for only 20 minutes when the cheese was browned. It was so rich and creamy!! Even my girlfriend who hates turkey leftovers had seconds! Highly recommended.",

Like others have suggested I added in about 3 tbsp cooked chopped onion 1 tsp Italian seasoning and sprinkled bread crumbs over the top before putting it in the oven at 375 for 50 mins. In the last two mins. I turned the oven up to broil to brown the bread crumbs. Make sure the milk/stock/butter liquid is mixed in well with the spaghetti otherwise some of the spaghetti will be crispy at the bottom. Same thing for any exposed spaghetti at the top of the casserole.",
