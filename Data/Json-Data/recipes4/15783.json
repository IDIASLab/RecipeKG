I cut the thick white stems out of the collard greens before I chopped the greens. Never having eaten okra I was a little scared so I threw in about a dozen fresh okra (cut into bite size pieces) and to make up for the difference I threw in about 6 fresh asparagus (cut into bite size pieces). I added about 2-3 cups of water at this point because the stew had very little liquid to simmer for an hour. I waited to add the cilantro until the kidney bean/tomato paste went in. I did not need to use flour because the stew was plenty thick. I said I addded 2-3 cups of water but it may have been 3-4 cups water. This was pretty thick and had NO broth at all. We were able to serve it on our plate instead of a bowl inspite of adding water- of course it didn't matter 'cuz the flavor was so good. One last note this recipe doesn't call for salt. I added salt and more dill and ginger for more flavor. Great recipe super healthy and easy to make. I served it with grilled tilapia and steamed broccoli.",

Added a quarter cup of Braggs brand apple cider vinegar to the greens to cook. We did not drain the greens and the cidery broth from the greens added a nice texture and flavor to the stew. We quadrupled the amount of garlic and added a dash of cayenne pepper and a teaspoon of powdered garlic as well. To make it more Jamaican we added jerk spices to the mash which worked really well. Also add some pigeon peas to the mash mixture.",
