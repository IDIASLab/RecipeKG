If your gravy is too thin, whisk a 1/2 cup of the gravy with 1 tablespoon of flour and stir it back into the meat mixture; cook until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes.",

Few changes I made were I browned the beef, then the onions and peppers and put it in the crockpot. Added the rest of the ingredients, used one large can of tomatoes instead of fresh, added a small can of chopped green chilies and just let it sit and cook all day.  It was fantastic. I did omit the water this time, b/c it wasn't necessary when I made it the last time. Also, the next day, I put the leftovers on the stove and addeda a can of black beans and it was a chunky meat chili. Served it both ways with cheese and sour cream. Big hit in my house and a great go to when I'm shuttling kids between baseball and dance this time of year!",

Two tablespoons of cumin seemed like a lot when I read the recipe, smelled like a lot while it was cooking, and tasted like there was too much of it too.  I thought perhaps the taste of the good sirloin steak I used would be all but lost.  I plowed on, reheating it the next day, and hoped for the best.  To my surprise, the cumin had mellowed, and once everyone added their accoutrements of choice, it all seemed to blend and meld and complement perfectly.  None of us could get enough.  I prepared this using fresh tomatoes as well as the suggested Rotel, and green pepper as well as red.  I served this with toppers of sour cream, shredded Cheddar cheese, chopped ripe tomato, fresh guacamole, sour cream and chopped iceberg lettuce.  Side dishes were cilantro lime rice and Frijoles a la Charra.  There couldn\u2019t have been a happier group (who happen to love Qdoba and Chipotle)",

I did find though that as it continued to cook on low it only got better, it was eaten at 2 hours simmer time. My mexican husband, and his mother thought it was the BEST. and the 14 year old (who is in a pizza fast food only phase ate it and then ate some more in a bowl sans tortilla about an hour later!) an oddity in our family we enjoy the taste of green pepper onion jalapeno and chopped tomato added shortly before serving wilting slightly, so that they retain some texture and great flavor. there is nothing better on a tortilla, Thank you, this one is now a staple for the chilly upcoming days!",
