I did use cabbage since I did not have it on hand. The only negative it was a tad bland. Next time I will double the amount of peanut sauce.",

I would recommend not cooking them more than 2 minutes (not sure all raman noodles are the same as far as cooking directions we got ours at an Asian market). The meat needed to be tenderized and it needed a little more kick. Otherwise it was pretty good. We had Peanut sauce on hand so we just added some Chili pepper sauce. Probably needed to add a bit more.",

People also suggested more flavor which was a big help so I used more peanut sauce soy sauce and saut\u00e9ed ginger with the steak. I'll probably use more peppers next time. The biggest hit was that I added peanuts to the dish. It gives a great crunch and flavor. Perfect intro to cooking!",
