It was so good my siblings finished the tahini sauce with their spoons. \n\nI just changed a few things to suit my tastes :\n\nMarinate chicken with 2 tsp tahini and 3-4 drops of lemon juice for 3 hours in the fridge.\nBring \u00be cup + 2 tbsp water and half of a Maggi\u00ae\u2019s heart vegetable broth (Coeur de bouillon L\u00e9gumes, Maggi\u00ae) to a boil over medium-high heat.\nOn low heat, whisk in tahini, soy sauce, 1 large clove of garlic and ginger. (I skipped honey, but still delicious.) Then, add 2 tsp of Tipiak\u00ae F\u00e9cule de Cuisine (a mix of potato and manioc starches) and cook on very low heat for 4-5 minutes.\n\nJust before serving, cook the chicken on low heat in a non-stick frypan without butter or fat : the oil in tahini and the low heat will avoid the chicken to stick and it will cook slowly to keep the meat very tender and juicy.",

Sauted them with the minced garlic and then added the water and the bouillon. Then I added the tahini, soy sauce, honey, garlic, sesame seeds, and pepper. I also added some cashew butter and thai chili paste which added a nice kick and enhanced the flavor of the sauce. I added the chicken and some froze broccoli florets last so that it would not be overcooked and it would take on flavor from the sauce. I did not add the flour at all because the sauce was already thick. In fact, I had to add some additional chicken stock to thin it out. Served it with rice. Overall, though, really great!",

I had kept the tahini in the fridge and it was a little thick so I'd suggest that if you are using tahini let it get to room temperature. Anyway it was really tasty with a nice hint of sweetness. I used a pound of chicken tenderloins and it worked out well. I used vegetable broth instead of a bouillon cube and didn't use any sesame seeds because I didn't have any!:) I didn't use any rice or noodles or anything -- instead I served it with some sauteed dark leafy greens (an \"Asian\" blend with bok choy kale chard etc) that I'd sauteed in a peanut oil blend with some more of the fresh ginger. I think it worked well together as a fairly healthy meal.",
