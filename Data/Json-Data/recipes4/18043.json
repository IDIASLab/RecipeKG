Brown lentils could probably also be used, but would require more cooking time and more water for simmering as the tiny red lentils cook much faster than brown. You can add your own spices to your taste preference. I think crushed pineapple would work well in this recipe for more of a tropical flavor.",

After it was done I I threw in a can of chick peas and a pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of cayenne.  Next time I'll try with a coconut milk instead of veggie broth like another reviewer mentioned.  I might add quinoa also next time.  Definitely will be making this again.",

Added fennel seeds chili flakes and thyme instead of tarragon because I did not have the latter on hand. Really good dish:)",
