I tried it both ways and found the charred skin adds a lot of flavor.  I core the tomatoes & jalapeno, cut them in two and place them skin side up before broiling; I found this faster and not as messy handling the hot foods.  Great way to eat healthy tomatoes; I use this sauce as a side dish with chicken or beef too.",

I also have swapped the jalapeno out and replaced it with habaneros and scotch bonnets, just to see how it tastes. If you like a bit more heat than what a jalapeno delivers, try the scotch bonnet variety instead (be sure to wash your hands well after handling and do NOT touch your eyes!). I also have used a small spanish onion or red onion, and like the results better than with a plain white onion. \r\nOne very helpful thing I've done based on the advice of another reviewer: I halve and core the tomatoes *before* putting them in to roast and remove the skin from the garlic cloves as well. It makes it MUCH easier to handle after you take them out from under the broiler.\r\nVery good, adaptable recipe.",
