I used hot Italian sausage and we did not find it spicy would increase spices next time and maybe add more beans black beans I think would be nice. You cannot taste the pumpkin it just makes it really thick I added water instead of milk needed to add more. Served with sour cream and shredded cheese. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #Pumpkincraze",
