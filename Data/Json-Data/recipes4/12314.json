The smells and flavors of this dish make it the perfect fall or winter meal. Thank you so much for sharing!",

It had been several years since I had enjoyed this traditional Christmas Eve fare prepared by my mother-in-law in Laval Quebec and it tasted just as I remembered it. French Canadians usually add a dollup of ketchup on the side when served at least my in-laws did. Somehow the spices come alive with the addition. This is as French Canadian as it gets. For a moister pie use twice as much ground pork as ground beef in your recipe and try a dab of ketchup on the side.",

Yours is the only one to have alspice in it that I've seen on the internet. My earliest and fondest memories was my Ma Mere making meat pies on Saturday mornings at 5 o'clock in preparation for the annual get together of the \"family\" on Saturday night. Meat pie was a weekend experience to sober up the men prior to driving home. Had it on Christmas but never associated the pie with it. The \"meat\" that was left over went into plastic containers to be eaten on top of toasted bread with bananas in the morning. I'll try your Tourtiere to see how close it comes to my Grandmother's and hope it does! I've missed a good piece of meat pie for a very long time! Merci!",
