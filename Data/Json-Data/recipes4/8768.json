I wanted to say to those who worry that, while it is delicious, it isn't that healthful, that it tastes just as good using veggie Italian sausage (Lightlife brand has 140 calories and 7 g fat per link) and 2% milk mozzarella. (You could just use an egg white, too, but I didn't bother with that.) I'm a professional chef, but my husband and I are trying to eat more healthfully, so I look for ways to cut calories and fat while still being yummy - and Italian dishes like this are often really good candidates.   And a hint to those who had a difficult time getting the eggplant flesh out of its shell: try scoring the eggplant before you oil and bake it, maybe even cutting the 1/2 inch around the shell ... works wonders!",

I used 1lb ground italian sausage instead of 1/2lb link sausage and therefore went heavy on the other ingredients. The ground sausage gave the filling much more flavor than the link would have. I also added ground oregano fresh cilantro parmesan cheese and extra moz. cheese. My gas oven cooks hot and really withered my eggplant skin on the initial roast so I turned it down to 375 for the second bake. My husband loved and I will make again.",
