If you have a smoker, you have to try this one. Remember, moderation is the key when eating a bacon explosion. Enjoy.",

My smoker was a little slower than expected, and we did broil the roll to crisp up the bacon.\n\nI made a few changes as well...\nI only used one package of bacon (16 strips) which I used to make a weave of seven by seven strips, with two  extra to help seal the ends.\nI did not use extra bacon in the interior, nor the barbeque sauce or rub.\nA mixture of half sweet italian and half hot italian sausage added plenty of flavour. (a total of one pound/ 500 grams)\nI also added pre-cooked small potatoes in the centre.\n\nAdd the Hickory smoke, and viola, a fantastic meal accompanied by corn-on-the-cob and ceasar salad!\n\nThanks for the inspiration!",
