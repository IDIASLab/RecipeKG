I have made it for years, but mine is just slightly different - simmer chicken with chicken broth, when chicken is cooked, shred it and add back into pan with broth. Add some cream of chicken soup and some cream or milk to make a gravy. Put out your ingredients in a long line and have your guests make their own plates. Suggest that they add all the ingredients because the flavors are great together. I use rice, chicken & gravy, cheddar cheese, diced celery, diced green onions, pineapple tidbits, shredded coconut, slivered almonds and chow mein noodles. YUM! Everyone raves about it!",

The ingredients seemed like things I liked but had never tried together so I gave it a shot. I wish I had trusted my instincts and just stayed away from it. This was nothing short of NASTY! My husband refused to eat it. I basically forced some down as I was starving by the time it was ready but it was NOT good by any stretch of the imagination. The ingredients just clashed to say the least. I hope to save some people some time and money by warning them about this recipe. Was this submitted as a joke? My bad for trying it!",

Here are some things I do or have done differently. Use leftover turkey or a whole chicken cut up boiled and meat removed. Use the broth to make a homemade gravy rather than use canned soup. And for other toppings we use diced celery slivered almonds raisins frozen peas and peanuts. Having a variety of toppings available is good for group gatherings but the ones listed in the recipe are a must for anytime. We love it and make this at least 2-3 times a year. YUM! Give it a try.",

                "reviewBody": "Here is a tip to make this a very easy dish: place the chicken breasts in a slow cooker on high for 3-4 hours. No liquid is needed--they'll be fine. Once they are very tender mash them up right in the slow cooker with a potato masher. Easiest way in the world to shred chicken and it takes about 10 seconds to do! At this point you can stir in your soup. I usually find that no extra water is necessary. When serving them we usually have diced celery and slivered almonds for toppings as well as those toppings mentioned in the recipe. The coconut and pineapple may sound bizarre to you but don't omit them--you'll be pleasantly surprised by the great flavor this combination creates! This is my whole family's favorite recipe EVER and it is EASY and DELICIOUS!!!",
