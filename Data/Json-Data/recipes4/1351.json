I added 1 tablespoon worchestershire to the beaten eggs, upped the garlic powder to a teaspoon and a half, eliminated the salt and I used black forest ham. I had a heck of a time rolling this, even with the butcher paper. I did get it rolled and smushed back together, but it came apart a little in the baking process. I think if I make this again, I'll let the meat mixture sit fifteen minutes before rolling or chill it an hour or something. It's in the oven now (and smells AMAZING) so I'll update how the family liked it once they've tried it. EDITED: Even as ugly as it came out, it was really tasty. The whole family LOVED it. This one's a keeper. I just have to practice rolling it!",

Put cheese in anything and he will eat it... He did. Now seriously i personally thought this was a great recipe. Was not hard at all to make. The taste was excellent. Very differnt and very satisfing. What I might do next time is change the way it is cooked. I did cook it for 2 hours and my center was still way to pink. Maybe if you layer it in a square 9x9 or 8x8. I am not sure but there has to be a better way. 2 hours is way too much. I really enjoyed eating it though. The next night I heated it up and made sandwiches. We put pickles and mayo on whole wheat bread and it was almost like a burger! This is a keeper except for the way it is cook i will come up with a plan for next time..",
