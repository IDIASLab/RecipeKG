I cooked the dish for an extra 15 minutes covering with foil for 12 minutes to make sure the asparagus was cooked. Ten minutes probably would have been sufficient as the asparagus turned out a little more cooked than I like. The cheese \"sauce\" turned out like mashed potatoes. It was okay but I probably won't make this again due to the consistency of the cheese and the lack of \"depth\" in this recipe.",
