Creamy and delicious and definitely not overpowering on the cauliflower flavor.  \n\nA few hints to make it stand out:  \nBe sure you drain the cauliflower after steaming.  You may even find a way to squeeze excess water from it.  Once everything is blended, it is very thin.  It holds it's shape and \"acts\" like mashed potatoes, but still very thin.  \n\nI felt the salt was actually lacking so I doubled the amount.\n\nKeep the food processor running the whole time while you add stuff.  You want to really process the heck out of it to get that creamy consistency.\n\nHERE IS THE BIG HINT!!!  Once you are done and ready to scoop it out of the food processor to serve it - DON'T!  Scoop it out and put it back in the pot you used to steam the cauliflower (after draining and drying the pot).  Heat it until piping hot.  On medium, this will only take a minute or two while you stir constantly.  Because the cauliflower is whirring around in the processor and you're adding cold cream cheese and cold parmesan cheese, it really brings the temperature way down.  I ate it immediately (it was good) and then tried a 2nd batch after heating it and the difference was dramatic.  HEAT!",

The garlic flavor is prominent, so you must like garlic. I had a 16oz bag of cauliflower in the freezer, I wanted to use up. I defrosted it and steamed it in the microwave for 5 minutes. For the tablespoon of cream cheese I had to use regular, as it was all I had from another recipe. The salt seemed like a lot, so I did use the Kosher salt suggested. It wasn't too salty. I don't have a food processor, so I put it in my Vitamix blender on medium speed. I tried to cream half of it, but it moved to the sides of the container. So, I added the rest of the ingredients minus the other half of the cauliflower. When I did that it all blended. After it was creamed I added the other half of the cauliflower and blended it until it was a good consistency. I like the way this looks like mashed potatoes, but doesn't give that heavy belly filling. I got about 3 small servings.",
