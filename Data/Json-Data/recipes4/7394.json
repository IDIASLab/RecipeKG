I think that if you make multiple modifications to a recipe then declare it is excellent you are really reviewing your version - not the original.\r\n\r\nThat said, as written this recipe produces a frittata with a very nice texture. If I were to make it again, I would make these changes to suit my taste: this needs more asparagus, maybe 1/4 cup of parmesan, garlic (saut\u00e9ed with the onion and mushrooms) and freshly ground black pepper. I think diced black or kalamata olives would be a nice addition too.\r\n\r\nI had this with whole wheat toast and fruit, but my husband ate it with leftover sriracha noodles (from this site) and said that it was a great combination. Thank you for sharing your recipe!",

A lot of breakfast casseroles I've tried are so-so but this was really good especially considering there was no added salt.
