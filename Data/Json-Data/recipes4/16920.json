The onions and garlic were a nice addition and the balsamic vinegar was the perfect ending.  It does get softer, but, retains some of the crunchiness and doesn't get as soft as spinach. I do wish the recipe was more clear on the amount of kale to add.  A bunch of kale can be anywhere from a couple of cups to 5-6 cups depending on the size of the bunch.    I bought a 16 oz bag of prewashed and cut kale and ended up using about 3/4 of the bag.   I just kept adding as it wilted until I thought I had a good amount in relation to the liquid.  I also used an entire onion since mine was on the small side.  Thanks for the recipe - I will be making this again.",
