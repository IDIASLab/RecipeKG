I just never really cared for them ... but on a recent trip to WI, my SIL told me about a recipe that was easy to make and very good. I couldn't recall the exact recipe, but I did an ingredients search on here, and this one came up, and sounded exactly like the one she told me about, so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did! This was very tasty, and a perfect Fall comfort food. The only adjustment that I made was I had about a half of a pack of portobella mushrooms in the fridge that needed to be used up, so I sauteed those in 1 Tbls. of butter, and added a bit of chopped parsley, then added the soup and wine. It was a great addition to the recipe, but I'm sure the recipe would have been just as good without them. Yummy!",

First I only had 2 HUGE chicken breast halves (for 3 people) so I sliced each of them into 3 pieces. Then I only had Cream of Mushroom Soup and I didn't have wine so I used Chicken Broth. I also had Asiago Cheese not Swiss. But these are all very subtle changes which just goes to show you can use what you have on hand and the dish still turned out great! With my chicken changes I cooked this for 45 minutes. I like that it was easy to put together and I was free to do other things while it baked in the oven. I served it with a side of fresh corn (the Stuffing and cream was like another side) and everyone loved this dinner!",

I have used other cheeses - provolone, cheddar - just used what I had on hand, everybody still loves it. \n\nThe only suggestion I have is instead of drizzling the butter on top of the stuffing mix is melt the butter add the stuffing mix to the butter and mix well. This will more evenly spread the butter over the stuffing mix and have a more even browning on top.",

This was REALLY GOID!!  It's to easy to good!!  My man tried to fuss .. But admitted it was \"actually not bad!\"  For him... That is a supreme compliment to a \"casserole\"!!

Turned out fantastic with stuffing moist, but also with a crunch on top.  Thank you for posting.  My family loves it!",

I pulled it out of the oven at 160 degrees and the extra five degrees to complete the cooking happened outside of the oven. The flavor is good better than average but we are not talking fancy here.
