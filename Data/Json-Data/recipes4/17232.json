I though the first steps defeated the whole purpose of using a rice cooker so I skipped boiling ingredients together and just dumped the liquids and spices in the rice cooker gave it a good whisk added the rice and pressed start. It came out just fine. My only substitution was I eliminated the salt and used vegetarian \"no chicken\" bullion'.",

                "reviewBody": "I had started making this dish and thought I was out of Turmeric (found it hiding in the cupboard the next day). I substituted the same measurement of turmeric with curry powder and the rice tasted great especially with the toasted coconut flakes. My only complaint would be that the rice seemed a little sticky/mushy when it was done (used the rice cooker) but the next day the rice was nice and fluffy (excess liquid probably removed/evaporated while reheating). Turmeric will give it a nicer flavor and color than curry powder for sure! Rating this recipe 4 stars as I feel the amount of liquid should be reduced to perhaps 1 cup total liquid to 1 cup rice. Note that there's no indication of the type of rice to be used with this recipe and I used 2 cups long grain white rice. Will be making this again with the turmeric and adjust the amount of liquid.",
