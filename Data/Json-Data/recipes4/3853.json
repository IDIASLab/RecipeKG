I did use cheese on the broccoli instead of butter and seasoning and I put less teryaki in (little over 1/2 tsp). I will probably use more broccoli next time too. I wish I had made 4 servings instead of 2 because I was still hungry when I was finished. We served it with fresh red grapes which were the perfect pair. This dish itself was even good after it got cold. I'm definitely making this again and might even add teryaki to some of the other tuna recipes I have... it just tastes so good (even if you aren't a big tuna eater)!",
