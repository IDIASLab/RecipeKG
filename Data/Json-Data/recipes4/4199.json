Few tiny changes for health reasons: used egg beaters rather than egg, made whole grain bread crumbs, and dipped in whole wheat flour before egg/milk mix. I WILL be making these again!",

If you really want it to be authentic, take the time to pound the meat until it's about 1/4\" thick.  It helps it overhang the bun (like it should).  Also, be sure to use mustard and pickles, the rest is optional.  Thank you, Kathi!",

I halved the recipe and did find however that the amount of bread crumbs was certainly too much for just two tenderloins and was able to bread 4 tenderloins with still more bread crumbs leftover. I would say half the amount of bread crumbs and if it is still too little then just add some more. For the cooking portion I heated up my oil on medium-high heat and was able to brown the tenderloin at 2 minutes a side making it 4 minutes per tenderloin. If I left it at 8 minutes as noted by the recipe directions it would certainly would have been burnt. But all in all a very hearty dish that I will certainly try again!",
