Also I found the smell of the cooking eggplant very unappealing which is probably another reason it was so unappetizing in the end. In all fairness my husband liked it but he is a sweetheart and will eat almost anything I make and say it s good. The kids absolutely refused to taste it and they are usually more adventuresome plus they like chili! I only tried this recipe because I had some stew beef I wanted to use in a different way. I have now learned my lesson and will never again make a recipe that has not been reviewed!",

Not exactly chili but a chili-like stew as my husband put it (he would only give it two stars). I found the spices a little too strong despite using 2 lbs. beef and less chili powder and oregano than called for. Taste test before you add the final salt. Mine was very watery after 8 hours on low so I turned it on high and stirred a lot to get the eggplant to break down. I like the idea of adding eggplant to regular dishes.",
