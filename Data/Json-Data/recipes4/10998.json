I used chickenbroth instead of just water, 2 tbsp. low sodium soy sauce, 2 tbsp. fishsauce, 1 tbsp. sesame oil, and 2 tbsp. curry powder. I also only used chicken and shrimp, instead of all the different meats, and an 8oz pack of noodles. This tasted almost better than would we get at the restaurant. However, next time I will double the spices, sauces, and broth. For people that think something is missing, add the fishsauce and sesame oil.",

Take the man at his word and use it to clear out the fridge: about the only essential distinct ingredients are the shrimp bean sprouts and the spices but you can vary the meats and other veggies freely. It's so easy to overcook shrimp that I just bury them in the hot noodles a couple of minutes before tossing everything together. Also when using frozen shrimp I use the plumping technique suggested by Molly O'Neil: defrost them in the fridge for 24 hours then brine them for an hour in a sugar/salt solution. I suggest only one major variation: I picked the brain of my local Singapore chef and found that he uses equal quantities of curry and chili powders.",

I added some bok choy with the bean sprouts, and put the shrimp in at the end and returned the meat to the pan just before adding the noodles.   This came out beautifully.
