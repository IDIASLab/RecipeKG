However they liked it as much as I did (so much for leftovers). I could eat this as a maindish...very tasty! I did reduce the soy sauce to 2 TBLS and next time I will TRY it with only 1/4 cup of oil (the idea of eating 1/2 cup oil really gets to me) to see if it still tastes and cooks great with less. Still very good! Thanks Kelly for sharing this!!",

Then there is the sodium in the canned broth. Whew! Fast doesn't have to me high sodium and high fat. Cut down on the oil to a couple of tablespoons. Use julst a tsp or two of the soy sauce. Make your own broth and have it frozen in cubes ready to use in your freezer. There are ways of making this healthier.",

I also used 2 tbsp. of oil, and 2 tbsp. of butter because like DREGINEK, I was a little weirded out about all of the oil.  I was a little schocked when my husband wasn't touching his, because he loves all of the ingredients, but he said it was too sweet for his liking & he is a red pepper fan (the combo of it all, didn't do much for him..reminded him of southwest style, which he doesn't care for).  Well, more for me, this was my dinner!  When I reheated this I added some left over corn and black beans and it was EVEN BETTER!!  Thanks for sharing Kelly!",
