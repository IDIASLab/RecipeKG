I only had regular cheddar cheese and Italian bread on hand, so I used those. Oh man, this is a seriously delicious sandwich! Great blend of flavors and textures.

Rye bread is traditional but whole wheat is nice too. Top with your favorite cheese (Cheddar American and Swiss are all traditional) and broil until the cheese melts and begins to brown. Serves 1.",
