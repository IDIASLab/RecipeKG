The only changes in her recipe were she used one of those large cans of spaghetti sauce (I want to say the brand is Hunt's-you can usually get them on sale for under a dollar at most stores) she added a teaspoon or so of italian seasoning to the sauce mixture and she added a generous layer of grated mozzerella cheese on the top. It bends well to whatever you have on hand (I've even made it with sausage/ground turkey or half the meat and adding in chopped veggies for the missing meat) and I've made it \"lighter\" with whole wheat pasta and lowfat cottage cheese/sour cream/cream cheese. It's always a family pleaser and the leftovers freeze/reheat well.",

One can drain it and reserve the liquid freezing it in an ice cube tray for other uses. I then blend the tomatoes as I'm not a tomato fan and add it in replacement of the tomato sauce. I use fire roasted tomatoes in a can for everything that requires sauce or canned tomatoes. Thank you VH for posting this recipe.",
