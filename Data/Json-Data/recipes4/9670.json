White Northern beans I find a little boring, so I used a bulk foods 13 bean mix, which had split peas, lentils, pinto, black, black eyed peas, garbanzo and several other types INCLUDING White Northern.  This bean mix is cheaper, especially in bulk, and possesses a much more complex flavor than just white beans alone.\n\nSecond, in the six cups of water I used  half chicken broth and half vegetable broth (both Better than Boullion) so that the flavors better complimented the vegetable mix in the soup.\n\nCayenne pepper instead of black, to go with the smoky flavor of half a pack of bacon (as opposed to straight ham, it was all I had on hand).\n\nI added 1 teaspoon celery seed to go with the celery stalks, plus three large carrots.  Also, though I had diced tomatoes on hand I figured hand-chopped Roma would add more flavor and better texture.\n\n\nThe beans were soaked overnight, so the soup only needs three hours on high in the crock pot to combine and reduce properly.  Served with homemade cornbread it was PHENOMENAL!  One of the best bean soups I have had, with the tweaks.  Perhaps it is not Navy Bean anymore, but I think the taste is quite a lot better.",

I made a few subtle changes as follows: I got one of those mongo-sized chicken broth cans (49.5 oz) and for the initial \"water\" used 4 cups water plus appx 2.5 cups broth. The rest of the broth I dumped in for the second addition of water (and used no water that time at all). I still used the bullion cube initially. I added ham hocks as well as a half lb of chopped up ham and I used an extra celery stick. Oh and it cooked a full 6 hours (which is what it took to get the beans to soften). THOSE ARE THE ONLY CHANGES I made! It really was delicious... SO FULL OF FLAVOR! Needed no second seasoning w/S&P (maybe cause of the broth?). Everyone loved this incl my 7 yr old. I served w/french breat and thats it! THANKS!",

                "reviewBody": "First tip; never add salt to cooking beans, don't know the reason but if you do add salt the beans never get done all the way, could be a reason for your crunch. My mother made the best bean soup ever and she always started with leftover ham bone (flavor is in the bone) also believe it or not at the very end of making the soup ....for a large pot of soup add 3-4 tbl. of cider vinegar. People will have NO idea what's different but it does give the soup more flavor. Good luck. Hope I helped.",
