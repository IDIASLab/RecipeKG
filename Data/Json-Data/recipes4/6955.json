I omitted the bacon (not missed) used a mix of cheddar and pepper jack cheeses and increased the overall cheese quantity to 1 1/2 cups and used 2 cans of chopped green chiles (mostly drained) rather than the fresh Anaheims. I also didn't bother to rinse the chorizo and onions - just drained them. It all turned out great. I had six good-sized peppers and still had stuffing left over (enough for one more large pepper) so I baked that separately in a small dish and it turned out well and was delicious just by itself. I'll definitely be making this again.",
