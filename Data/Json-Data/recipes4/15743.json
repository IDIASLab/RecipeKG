First, it uses natural cheddar instead of  processed cheese. Second, it used a variety of vegetables to add depth of flavour, not only broccoli, but potato, celery, onion and carrot. That said, I did do some things differently from the recipe. Of course, I added salt and pepper. I also added about a teaspoon of thyme (dried) and a large pinch of nutmeg. I cooked the vegetables  for longer than  20 minutes to ensure they were tender, and also cooked the flour and butter roux for 1 to 2 minutes to ensure there was no floury taste to the soup. Served with crispy garlic toast for a lovely warming dinner. Thanks!",

This is one of those recipes. It will work well even for beginning cooks can be adapted as you wish and is absolutely delicious. I started with this recipe as my guide but made some changes: I didn't have any celery so that was left out. I added about 3/4 cup of frozen corn some minced fresh rosemary about a cup of diced lean turkey ham and a generous amount of fresh ground pepper. I wanted to reduce the calories and fat so I reduced the butter by a third the cheese by one half and I used almond milk (plain - don't use sweetened or flavored almond milk for this) instead of whole cow's milk. I'm sure the full amount of butter or cheese would make a really rich soup but we did not miss it at all. Even with the lesser amounts of butter and cheese this soup was delicious. With all of these changes I ended up with about 10 cups of soup a healthy 166 calories per cup just under 10 grams of fat per cup and very satisfying and filling. Pair with a salad and you'll have a wonderful healthy meal full of fiber and nutrients!",

I knew one of us would not eat it with vegetables in it so I boiled them in chicken stock for about 35 minutes To make them very soft. Then I pureed them with my inversion blender until it was smooth. A blender or food processor could be used instead to make the puree. The result was a good base for the soup and helped to thicken it. The carrots gave it a color similar to cheese. Voila! All vegetables hidden. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. Ingredients I changed were few. I chopped the broccoli stems and used only one third of the broccoli heads with the vegetables I boiled. I cooked the remaining broccoli heads in the microwave and them put them into the soup after I pureed. I had 2 Oz of processed cheese product to use up so I put it in. The soup didn't need it though. It was rich and creamy and had a better cheese flavor before I added it.next time I make it I may add some herbs.",
