I do not recommend substituting the cheek meat with roast, it won't taste right. Barbacoa has a certain gelatinous slide and tack that is the hallmark of the genre. Serve on tortillas with hot sauce and chopped cilantro.",

The meat is very versatile,  use it for casseroles, tamales, tequitos, even shredded beef burgers. As far as the salt issue, I just sprinkled the beef liberally with salt n pepper, not nearly 1/4 cup and it was perfectly fine. I did not marinate this at all. We ate this for dinner of course and can't wait to make Machaca in the morning with it!!",

I found this recipe and although I found some others that used chuck roast instead, I wanted to try and make Barbacoa authentically. I reduced the salt by a tablespoon (we still really like salt, although I think I could have used the directed amount and it would have been fine) as per other reviews and used more Cumin to make up the difference. Marinated for 12 hours or so. We made tacos with it, topped with some Mexican blend cheese, salsa, and sour cream. It was awesome! My husband said it needs to be a weekly dish (great for me because I get to use the slow cooker) and after smelling the leftovers he brought for lunch, his co-workers asked me to make more for them next time since it's usually only available at a few restaurants here in Texas. I'd never even heard of this dish before, but so happy I stumbled across it. Set it and forget it prep.",
