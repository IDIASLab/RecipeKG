I make the \"Tex Mex Pork\" from Allrecipes and put the shredded pork in its sauce over pasta and add the \"Habanero Hot Sauce\" with sour cream as a condiment and everyone loves the combination!  The only modification I make to this recipe is I cut open my habanero and remove the seeds and stem.  My husband and I love hot food, but we managed to ruin a different recipe when we added whole habaneros because it was so hot that we couldn't eat the stew we had slaved over for an entire afternoon. I opt to put my habaneros  in a pyrex and steam the habaneros in a double boiler for about 7 minutes.  I think this mellows out the hotness of the sauce without losing any flavor.  I add everything to a food processor minus the tomato and it makes a delicious fairly spicy sauce that pleases the masses.",

This recipe came pretty close though i must say i used 4 peopers and it was so hot i couldnt't' eat it so i doubled the other ingredients and decreased the overall pepper to other ingredient ratio. Now its perfect. I would reccomend starting with two peppers an increasing as you go by taste and to pur preference. Thanks!",
