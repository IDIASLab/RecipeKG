The secret ingredients are the curry and Parmesan cheese! Odd combinations but this makes a terrific tuna sandwich! She used it for an appetizer with gourmet crackers and people always wanted her recipe. I have never tasted another tuna salad quite like this one, and it has been my favorite recipe for tuna salad for many, many years.",

I don't understand why some reviews state that there's too much mayo or dill.  When draining the tuna, I use the lid of the can to squeeze it dry.  Isn't that how everyone does it?  It makes quite a stiff mixture this way.  I also used the straight edge of a spatula to level off each measuring spoon and get an accurate measurement of each ingredient.  My 7th grade home economics teacher was a stickler about this.  I find this especially important when using the more potent herbs and spices such as in this recipe.\n\nAnyway...I simply ate this on a slice of sundried tomato bread from my local bakery.  I was planning to toast it first but I couldn't wait!  It was delicious!  Once this is refrigerated overnight and served on bakery bread with romaine lettuce, swiss cheese and a slice of garden-ripened tomato it is a ten star recipe for certain!",

I doubled this recipe and found that the taste was just ok, but easily modified to be GREAT!   First of all, I would cut down on the amount of relish and parsley and add a little more cheese.  I used fresh onion since I don't keep minced dried onion in the house.  It took about 2 Tbl of the onion to make it \"show up\" in the taste of this recipe.  That's 2T total for this recipe DOUBLED.  I know I will make this again, but with a few little tweaks that I mentioned.  Also, don't be afraid of the curry.  It is excellent in this dish!",

I normally don't like sweet pickle relish in tuna salad, but for some reason it works here.  I used 1/4 tsp. of dried minced onion flakes and was a bit liberal with the garlic powder.  I also added a bit of salt and pepper.  I have to say, this is probably one of the best tuna salads on this site.  It was so good I whipped up a second batch and made a sandwich for my husband to take to work tomorrow.  He's not a huge tuna salad fan, but I bet this will turn him into one.

I changed a few things because of mine and my family's tastes. I added some hard boiled eggs, more onion, a dash of yellow mustard and a pinch of tarragon. I usually do a little tweaking to most recipes I as I've been cooking for 40 years and know what my family likes. But if a recipe I've seen here doesn't turn out well and I have altered it, I would NEVER come here and give it a poor rating since I changed it!
