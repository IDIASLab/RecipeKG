Instead of string cheese I use shredded mozzerella and I use my own homemade italian seasoning and homemade marinara. It's always a hit. If you're feeling lazy this recipe also works if you quarter your biscuits and then layer them in your baking pan spread the sauce (combined with the spices) over the top of the biscuits (you might need more sauce) then sprinkle with the cheeses. It will also be like Pull Apart Bread but more like pizza. GREAT way for couponers to use their many canisters of whomp biscuits.",

Oh and I use homemade sauce and shredded mozzarella but those are just personal preferences. Just a warning this flies off the table!;)",

I did just eyeball the Italian seasoning just to taste and added some parsley as well. I could see just making this an appetizer or a side to a nice salad and calling it dinner...that's how much we enjoyed it! I will ALWAYS keep the ingredients on hand for this awesome bread YUM!

I did make a few changes: I'm not a biscuit fan so I used refrigerated crescent dough instead I flattene out a triangle and put a tiny spoon of marinara at the short end with a cube of cheese on top folded in the corners and rolled it up pinching the sides to make sure nothing leaked out. I also took another reviewer's advise and seasoned the bottom of the pan after spraying it with Pam (garlic salt oregano basil). I baked it according to the package directions although it needed about 10 extra minutes to cook through. But I was totally delicious and simple I will def make this again and again!!!",
