I used different time and temperature & also used a sirloin bone-in pork roast instead of a pork shoulder.  I would encourage someone to make this exactly according the recipe (unlike me) and I am sure you will not be disappointed.  An internal temperature of 170 will give you meat that can be sliced, cook to 190 and it is more like pulled pork.  Great flavor and I will be making this again.  Thanks!",
