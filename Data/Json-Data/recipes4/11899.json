I also added extra beef granules for flavor. I left out the mushrooms and they weren't missed. I browned the meat onions and garlic all at the same time. I used 1 tsp. season salt instead of plain salt and added 3 bay leaves. I let it simmer about 30 minutes after adding the veggies then another 20 with the dumplings. I used my own dumpling recipe instead of the Bisquick one. This was a delicious meal for a cold winter night. Very tasty and comforting.",

I made just a few modifications----browned the beef cubes in olive oil instead of butter used beef broth in place of the water (upped to 3 cups) and used \"lite\" baking mix and skipped adding the butter added 3 Tbls. of parmesan cheese instead. Wonderful will use this recipe in the future.",

However I made a few changes and ended up with dynamite results and lots of flavor. First I used butter and olive oil to brown the beef because I love the two flavors together! I also browned the beef with the onions and garlic which acted as a seasoning for the beef; without it the meat is bland. Setting the beef aside I cut up my celery mushrooms and carrots and threw them in the crock pot. The idea of dumplings was good but I used potato gnocchi you can get right off your supermarket shelf. This took the place of the dumplings and the potato. I threw the meat over the veggies the dumplings over the meat added 2 cups of water a can of low sodium beef broth and a can of french onion soup. Cooked on low setting for 4 hrs and it was out of this world!",
