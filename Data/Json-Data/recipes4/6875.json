I used frozen vegetables instead of canned - I always use fresh or frozen never canned - and made my own beef broth from a powdered broth base/seasoning instead of already-made. Instead of tomato sauce I used fresh diced tomatoes. This recipe needs a lot of seasoning because it is very bland as written. I was very generous with garlic salt pepper and dried parsley. I also added a tsp of Penzey's Beef Roast seasoning and used 1 tbsp of Melissa's fresh parsley paste. Season your heart out!! Next time I'll be using two cans of diced tomatoes and adding half a bag of pearl onions.",
