I just take a fork & occasionally poke it to see if the fork slides in easily.  I use 6-8 med red potatoes, 4 large (baseball size), or about 11-12 if they're the really small (little bigger than golf ball) ones.  After I quarter the potatoes, I cut those in half again to make them more bites-size esp. for my toddler who LOVES these.  I find NO NEED for butter outside of PAM to grease my dish.  Otherwise, it turns out GREASY! ...and I use 3T of honey and sprinkle some parsley for color.  No onions if my husband is eating.  Sometimes I line w/foil too because it can get sticky, otherwise a good soaking gets it all up quickly.  UPDATE: It's perfect (nice glaze) w/o being too sweet, but you should mix it a few times while baking so what has become a liquid can be reapplied and the potatoes on the top aren't dry.  Be sure to line these on a sheet instead of layering too because the top ones will be dry.  I ALSO have to use more than a pinch of salt.  Sprinkle enough so there's a little on all the potatoes or it's too bland.  Broiling for the last 2-3 min. caramelizes the honey nicely.  My husband & kids like ketchup on these which surprised me since they taste divine with nothing on them. ",

I boil the potoatoes first - just until a little more tender, but still firm (not for too long or will be mushy after roasting- just up to 5 minutes, no more). I have tried the recipe without boiling first, and then with boiling, and WITH BOILING FIRST THE POTATOES SOAK IN MUCH MUCH MORE OF THE BUTTER/HONEY FLAVOUR!\r\n\r\n2. I always double the butter/honey mixture, and halfway through roasting I stir the potatoes and top off with extra of the butter mixture (1/2 of butter mix on poatoes at beginning, 1/2 of mix midway through roasting\r\n\r\n3. I roast until I have enough \"crispy\" potatoes\r\n\r\n4. Instead of using onion (my kids won't eat) I add onion powder to the butter/honey sauce.\r\n\r\n5. I use more dry mustard powder than the recipe calls for (add to taste)\r\n\r\nSometimes I boil the potatoes the night before, and then do the butter/honey mix and through potatoes in the oven just before company arrives. Try not to layer your poatoes - single, but \"tight\" (so the sauce doesn't just end up all the bottom) layer is best.",
