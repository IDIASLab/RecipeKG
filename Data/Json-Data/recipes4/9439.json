I used approximately 1/2 can of stock in the sauce and found it too soupy I'll use less next time. I couldn't find couscous so I used yellow rice and it turned out fine.

I seasoned the chicken breast with tarragon carraway seeds thyme poultry seasoning red pepper flakes and seasoning salt before I browned them.

Once the vegetables have been added add more seasoning if needed. Add a little of the lemon juice to the chicken for an extra kick. I agree with the last reviewer.. reduce the amount of chicken stock because it's soupy. I also used rice instead of couscous.",

I added more veggies: 1 yellow pepper 1 green pepper 1/4 of red onion (all largely chopped) and instead of fresh tomatoes I used 1 can of diced organic tomatoes. I also added more chicken stock and used a substitute for the cream to make it even healthier. Heat 1 Tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Sautee veggies then add chicken. Start with stock like recipe calls for (1 can) and use it make couscous. Remove chicken and veggies from pan but do it separately. Dump in the other half of the broth and another can of broth. Add herbs and bring to a rolling boil. (I also added 1 C of corn at this point because it had been frozen.) 1 and 1/4 Cup of Plain non-fat yogurt and 4 teaspoons of corn starch well blended (just beat it with a fork. it will be smooth.) Then add that to the broth once the broth is boiling. Slowly pour in yogurt while stirring broth. Cook for a minute and re-add veggies and chicken. Next time I will cut up my chicken after cooking but before re-adding to the sauce. Also I didn't have tarragon so i used \"savory herbs.\" To the sauce I also added 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper and a pinch of salt. Let sauce thicken up for about 5 minutes. Voila! It was delicious healthy and my co-workers and boyfriend loved it! Even the leftovers were fantastic for lunch the next day.",

I also added the juice of 1 whole lemon to some israeli couscous. Very good!",
