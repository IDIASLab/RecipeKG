The chicken shreds incredibly easy cooking it this way. Our favorite veggies to eat with this dish is spinach, onions, and roasted red bell peppers, which I normally throw in the crockpot along with the chicken. I season my chicken with salt, pepper, garlic, and onion powder.  I also drain the broth from the chicken and veggies really well and add softened cream cheese before rolling the filling in the crescents. I bake the rolls without the soup so it's not so doughy then add the soup mixture and top with cheese with a few minutes under the broiler.  Sooo delicious.",

Put your veggies (frozen/fresh - whatever you have on hand)  in the cream soup and heat separately.  I also add a few dashes of Weber roasted garlic and herb spice.
