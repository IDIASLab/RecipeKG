I made 130 of them for a cupcake tower for my daughter's graduation. They are not fussy however they are special enough. Everyone LOVED them... even the chocolate lovers. I would also like to add that the frosting held up in 90 degrees in high humidity. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. It has been added to my favorites in my collection and already been passed on to several family members.",

Like other posts I agree that there is too much brownie mix to cupcake mix. For 24 cupcakes I used a box of the cake mix and only half of the brownie mix... and it came out to the perfect proportions in my opinion. I filled each liner with 1tbs of brownie batter and 3tbs of cake batter. Since this was inspired by the neopolitan ice cream as well... I went ahead and piped my vanilla frosting into a McDonald's styled icecream swirl adding a cherry on top for extra visual appeal. Definitely will be trying this recipe again!",

I ran out of the strawberry cake mix after filling 30 cupcakes so I put the extra brownie mix into a small pan and baked it so I have brownies too. I used 2 different types of cupcake pans 1 Faberware which is heavier and a little darker and my 40 year old Sears aluminum so 1/2 of my cupcakes were burnt on the bottom. The ones that were not burnt are delicious. Will definitely make these again.",
