I added more celery, onion, and bell pepper than I should have, but it was all the merrier.  I didn't think it was going to be very good....until it all started to marry in the pot.  YUUUUMMMMM.  I even left out the bacon and shrimp, and it rocked!!!!!  I used minute rice, boil in the bag, so I cooked the rice first, but not too much, and then poured it in the brew.  That worked out really well.  I'm always leary of cookin rice, I can screw that up fast!  Uncle Ben's Boil in Bag is awesome.",

I used Smart Balance to saute the veggies instead of bacon... the bacon sounded too heavy, plus in the south, everything is cooked in butter, right?\n\nI used extra creole seasoning, an extra teaspoon or maybe a little more and served it with Crystal hot sauce.  Excellent!  My eight year old agrees.",

My mom has had Jambalaya in Louisiana and said mine was the best she's ever had! I did make adjustments. I used 1.5 onions, and 2 bell peppers (one red, one green). I used 14oz of kielbasa because I wanted to use up the whole package. I used 2 chicken breasts instead of 1. I may have put a little more than 2 cups of jasmine rice into the mix, and in addition to the crushed tomatoes, I used a 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes with their juice. I used fresh medium-sized shrimp. I used a 32oz box of beef broth and a 14.5oz can of chicken broth. I used both fresh and dried thyme because I had fresh on hand. I added 3 cloves of chopped fresh garlic in with the onions and peppers during the last minute, and powdered onion and garlic powder to taste. I also added crushed red pepper flakes to taste. All in all, I think it was perfect; my rice cooked up perfectly in about 20 minutes and the consistency was nice and thick. MAKE SURE YOU STIR THOROUGHLY EVERY 5 MINUTES WHILE THE RICE IS COOKING SO IT DOESN'T STICK OR CLUMP IN THE POT!",
