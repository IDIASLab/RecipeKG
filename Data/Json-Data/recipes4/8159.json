If you want to spend more time on it, you can make your own sauce and breadcrumbs, but I'm often looking for a quick potluck meal, and this is an easy, fast recipe that always gets great reviews.",

I think I may have drained off too much water as a bit of a struggle getting whole wheat bread crumbs to coat all 4 sides really well but it still came out well. In addition to using whole wheat bread crumbs I also used I can't believe it's not butter vs real butter to reduce calories and weight watchers points and it still had excellent flavor. I'm not a huge buffalo sauce fan but fam and I are doing strictly vegetarian for a week and they love buffalo wings so thought I'd give it a try. Glad I did as am pleasantly surprised at how much I like it!",
