It\u2019s not something that you can throw together in a few minutes, but it\u2019s worth the investment of time.  By all means, let the onions caramelize.  My cable company came right after I started this dish, and I lost my iPad connection for about 20 minutes while he was installing the new modem, so I just let the onions continue to cook.  I served this over an AR recipe ground beef patty, as well as some mashed potatoes.  The red wine definitely gives it a nice flavor.  This is a versatile gravy that I can see being served over so many different foods.",

I only used 1/2 tsp of Dijon Mustard-in that amount it serves as a flavor enhancer but isn't too \"mustardy\" tasting. I was surprised at how easy carmelizing the onions is--I turned the heat to low and they virtually cooked themselves. The second time I used Williams Sonoma's beef stock concentrate instead of chicken stock like the first time I made it-both versions were equally good. I used bangers from the Whole Foods meat department and if you can find bangers they taste much better than Italian Sausage or some other sausage substitute. They have a more subtle flavor and I believe are seasoned with cardamom and coriander. However they have breadcrumbs in them so they are not gluten-free. I just added a photo of the gravy made in my 3.7 qt Mauviel saute pan.",
