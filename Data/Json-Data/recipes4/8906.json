I roasted my peppers over the open flame of my gas stove to save time but they can easily be roasted in the oven too. Roasting the peppers really brings out a smokiness which plays a big part in the end flavor so I do not recommend skipping this step. Roasting them also brings on more heat so you may want to use less if you are sensitive to heat. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!",
