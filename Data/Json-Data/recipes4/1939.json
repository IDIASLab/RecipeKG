Also, brown the rice along with the onion and garlic for best flavor, and squeeze in the juice of 1/2 fresh lime just before covering.  THE SECRET TO GETTING THE RICE TO \"FLUFF UP\" is 1) use long grain white rice, 2) make sure whatever liquid you use is HOT when you add it, 3) ALWAYS use twice as much liquid as rice (1 cup rice, 2 cups chicken broth or water) and 4) once you cover your pot and turn your burner to low, DON'T TOUCH the rice, DON'T LIFT the lid, don't stir it, let it do it's thing. After 20 minutes turn burner off but let the pot sit for at least another 5 - 10 minutes before removing the lid. You will have perfect rice, every time.",

Although here in the northeast I find most Mexican restaurant rice similar to what I'm used to, also.  But, anyway....\r\n\r\nNext time I will: omit the green pepper as their taste tends to bully the other flavors, up the cumin to 3/4 tsp, and stir in the cilantro after the rice is cooked to keep it's fresh, earthy flavor intact.",

Living in the Phoenix area for 15+ years, I've had lots of variations on the theme.  Still, it is an excellent recipe, and my husband prefers it to any that we've had in restaurants.  I found that it is even tastier if I saute the rice for a few minutes, then add the veggies (garlic finely minced)to the pan and let them cook down just a bit.  That way, the flavors \"mingle\" better, and it sweetens up the garlic and onion.  A brief saute also distributes the taste of the jalapeno and dissipates the heat.  Thanks for a great recipe.",

I cook the onions with the rice, then add some garlic and the peppers, then petite diced canned tomatoes.  Simmer one minute, then add the broth and seasonings.",

Not only does it take longer to cook, which I knew beforehand - it doesn't taste as good as white rice and doesn't pick-up the flavor as well.  Next time I try this - I'm using white rice.",

One reason could be brand - get a name brand long grain rice, not the store brand kind (it makes a HUGE difference in texture) also, when you reduce the heat and cover, DO NOT PEAK!  Don't stir it, don't touch it until the 20+ minutes is up, then check it.  If there's still a lot of liquid, keep the lid off and cook until it's evaporated.  I hope this helps : )",

I used all the ingredients and measurements as written, however,I added the chopped onion to the rice and oil (I used olive oil) in step one and when the rice was opaque I also added to garlic. (do not add the garlic with the rice and onion... it will burn and be bitter). I then stirred the cumin into the rice before adding the broth. Brought it to a boil, added everything else and returned it to a boil...and this means a full, rolling boil, not just a few bubbles! If you don't have a really tight fitting lid, cover the kettle with foil and then place the lid on top.. folding the excess foil up a over the top. This will help create a better seal and keep more steam in to cook the rice.  Also, as another person mentioned...DON'T PEEK! After 20 minutes on low, remove from the heat and let sit another 5 minutes...and DON'T PEEK!\n\nThanks for the wonderful recipe...it will be a staple in my house!",
