A few days later, I had to come up with something quick for dinner, and used things I had on hand.  It's not exactly gourmet but a good take on the nostalgic dish and everyone at work the next day said it smelled GREAT! Serve over hot buttered rice.",

It was a bit runny so I added more turkey (about 3 cups). Didn't have cream of chicken soup so used cream of mushroom and added 1 tsp of dry chicken stock. I also added a bit of Frank's hot sauce to spice it up a bit. I'm used to having turkey a la king served over wide noodles from when I was a kid - we didn't have any so served it over left over stuffing. Yum! Overall a good recipe to play with.",

My kids don't like mushrooms sadly but I used chopped onion and a stalk of celery diced. I omitted the onion powder. I also didn't have the sherry so I used white wine. I know traditionally a la King uses sherry but with a dash of sugar I think it turned out great. I served this over hot biscuits instead of noodles and it was a nice change.
