Although she did say it was \"OK\") I substituted a 28 oz. bag of frozen corn for the canned corn and I cooked it in the crockpot for 5 hours on high instead of using the oven. I was nervous about using the crock pot but it came out \"PERFECT\". It starts out kind of \"chunky looking\" but ends up nice and creamy. I stirred it a few times maybe once every hour. My dh was really mad at me at first that I was trying a \"NEW\" recipe on Thanksgiving especially because he really loved my old corn casserole recipe but he said he likes this one even better. I said \"See? You'll just have to trust me. I know what I'm doing. I'm a professional!\" This recipe satisfies all three of my requirements 1) It's inexpensive 2) It's easy 3) It's absolutely delicious!",

But I liked the basic idea so this is what I ended up with - and what got very good feedback from my guests: I halved the amount of cream cheese and butter used yellow kernel corn (only 4 cans though) and substituted 1 diced green bell pepper for the jalapenos. And last but not least: a little bit salt and pepper doesn t hurt this recipe so I added to taste. This served easy 12 people as a side dish even though everybody liked it a lot. And it was creamy enough - I'm happy that I didn't drown it in the amount of butter that the recipe asks for.",

This dish had quite a bit of heat to it with the jalepenos (and I used less than recommended!) I backed off on the butter per other reviews and it still was a bit much. The butter wasn't absorbed and stayed on top making the dish look a bit greasy. I did melt some cheddar cheese on top to give it more of a solid look. I served this dish at a potluck and people generally liked it but I did end up with left-overs.",
