I kept it in the fridge and then while we were having a drink with appetizers at dinner I put it in the oven for 20 minutes! If you like your meat well done though you should leave it longer maybe 30. The porcinis are delicious and the sauce didn't come out thin at all and I used light cream not the thick kind. However next time I think I will omit the stock cube as it takes away the totally 'home made' feel from the dish. Thanks for a great recipe!",

I also went overboard with the mushrooms which may have given it a stronger flavor than it needed. The sauce did thin out a bit once it was in the oven with the tenderloins-I'm positive it will thicken with the leftovers. My picky seven year old who doesn't even like steak devoured it- and my husband loved it.We'll be making it again.",
