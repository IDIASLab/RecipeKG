I used Uncle Ben's chicken and wild rice (but discarded the \"chicken\" seasoning that comes with the rice) used 2 1/4 cups of water and was able to fit 4 small/thin pork chops on top. While browning the pork chops I added dashes of garlic and onion powder. AWESOME FLAVORS and the meat was soo tender! Unfortunately there wasn't enough for us all! Will make this again and again!

It seemed to me that if I did the onion soup mix and the seasoning packet would make the rice entirely too salty. So I chose to omit it. Secondly there seemed to be mixed feelings in the reviews about the amount of water to add. The rice box said to use 2 1/4 cups of water so that's what I did and I'm glad. This dish turned out ok but it wasn't anything special. The pork chops were tender and it was an easy meal to prepare. I would make this again but would use just plain white or brown rice with the Lipton Soup Mix.",
