My mother taught me that if you want a soup or chili to have more thickness, scoop out a cup of beans or two and run them thru the food processor (you can use canned beans in their liquid if you need to) ...then dump them into the soup. The liquified beans keep the beany flavor yet add body to the soup....this is a great go to recipe and you can easily use chopped ham or a ham bone or chopped chicken or not ....vegetarian bean soup is good too...just add some  liquid smoke flavoring .  Go easy with the liquid smoke..a little goes a long way.",
