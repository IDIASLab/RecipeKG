It's easy I have most of the ingredients around the kitchen and it can be pre-made and go into the fridge before putting it in the oven. A few slight changes- I added garlic powder ginger powder and chili powder to the yogurt mixture to give it a little kick. The yogurt keeps the chicken SO moist you actually think your chicken is undercooked because it's so juicy! I even used Gluten Free Panko crumbs and it still turned out crispy and amazing. I paired this with brown rice cooked in light coconut milk and stir fried green beans with fresh garlic and fresh ginger drizzled with honey. What an easy weeknight meal for me and the hubby.

I cooked mine at 400 for about 9 minutes then flipped for another 9 to 12 minutes the coating came out toasty. My son loved the yogurt sauce but didn't really eat much of the chicken.
