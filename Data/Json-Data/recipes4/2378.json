I used chicken drumsticks, not breasts, and it took forever the inside of the chicken to cook while the outside coating became rubbery.  So having been raised a good portion of my childhood in Kentucky I remembered that mamy people boiled the chicken first (not all the way cooked) before coating and frying.  This allows for way less cooking time in the skillet and the for the coating to be crispy, not chewy.  Also, a good way to get rid of that blood that comes from the bone while frying (if not using the boil method)...soak the chicken in ice and water with salt for about half an hour before cooking.",

It was good. I didn't measure anything out, just threw the spices in. I added alot more garlic, I love it, and of course more salt amd pepper. I salted and peppered the chicken and the egg mixture. You cannot fry chicken in 15 minutes. I cooked on high for 5, then flipping, on medium, with lid on for 20. Nice and crispy. Served with baked potato and corn. Will make again.",

Out of this world - great to use buttermilk when soaking raw onions for onion rings too.  In order to cut down on the actual frying time, I generally brown my chicken and then place it on a broiler rack and bake it for 45 minutes in a 375 oven.  The broiler rack allows alot of the fat to drip off.  Line the bottom with foil and spray the rack with Pam before placing chicken pieces on top, clean up is a breeze.\n\nI too like a bit of dill in my chicken coating and I use ordinary flour instead of bread crumbs.  I also add a generous portion of Lawry's salt, but you can also use Lemon Pepper if you are watching your salt intake.",
