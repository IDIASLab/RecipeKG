Even though I added them with the first broth addition they weren't done with the rice and other vegetables. I had to add more water and cover at the end to get them tender / crisp. This adjustment worked and the taste was great. The feta went very well. A good way to use the summer vegetables.",

This increased the cooking time by 15 minutes. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly! I love feta but would be interested to try Parmesan. The pea pods and beans were not as tender as the broccoli and zucchini so I could see steaming them a bit. They were perfect for us! Will definitely make again.",
