I used 2 lbs of chuck roast cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes seasoned with salt pepper garlic powder and red pepper flake. I browned the meat in 1 tablespoon of oil before adding to the slow cooker. After I browned the meat I sauted the onion along with 2 cloves of garlic until lightly golden. Doing this may take a little bit of time but it does wonders to add flavor to the final stew. Also I needed to add a 16 oz bottle of barbecue sauce to ensure there was enough sauce. I thinned it with a 1/2 cup of beef stock. Garnished the stew with cheddard cheese and served over biscuits.",

I used Bush's Barbeque Baked Beans 2 28oz cans and drained juices from one of them before putting in crock-pot. I also added 1/2 bottle of our favorite barbeque sauce. I think this recipe is great because you can customize it so easily to your families taste. If you found it bland but liked it otherwise try it again seasoning the meat and adding in some of your family s favorite flavors I did and it was a hit. Try a little mustard for a tang. I am going to put chunked pineapple in next time. Little meatballs instead of stew meat if your kids don t like stew meat.",

I cut the potatoes into small cubes since we have little ones and used regular baked beans. Left it on low for 8 hours-- I was concerned it wouldn't be juicy enough but it was just perfect! My two little girls (2 and 3) ate their entire bowlful and my husband had 2 big bowls. I served it with bbq sauce on the side and a loaf of hot fresh bread. Perfect meal for a winter evening!",
