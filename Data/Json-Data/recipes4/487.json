As I've been perfecting the art of making the perfect pizza crust, I try out a new topping combination every week - let me tell you, this beats them all!  I used Ken's Steakhouse bleu cheese dressing (only 1/2 - 1 cup), Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Chicken Sauce on shredded chicken (works better on pizza than cubed, I think), and a mix of 1/2 cheddar, 1/2 mozzarella cheese - all things we had on hand.

The second time I made it with store bought dressing and it wasn't half as good. Use Bill's recipe. You won't be sorry. Also the Boboli thick crust is way better for this recipe than the thin. As suggested I used roasted chicken. Big time saver. Last but not least I used Lousianna Hot Sauce (1 1/2 tbls to 3 tbls butter). Just spicy enough. Will definately make this again and again and again....",

For the sauce use about 3/4 cup Franks Red Hot (or any other hot sauce) 1 tbl margarine 1 tbl honey or sweet and sour sauce (to calm down the heat some) and a dash of garlic salt. Also you can't have chicken wings without celery so why have your chicken wing pizza without celery??? I cut up 3 or 4 stalks. Building the pizza as follows... wing sauce (spread like pizza sauce) diced chicken dollops of blue cheese (3/4 of a 16 oz jar) celery and then the mozzarella. If your oven is hot enough the crust will not be soggy. Thanks for the recipe!!!",

I used the Pillsbury refrigerated pizza crust and partially baked it before I put any of the fillings on top. I'm not a big fan on blue cheese, so I subbed peppercorn ranch instead and didn't use near the full bottle...only about 3/4 of a cup.  I didn't use the full 2 oz of hot sauce because I only had half a bottle and it tasted great!!  I sprinkled some italian cheese on top and the cheddar directly on the crust so the dressing wouldn't make it soggy. What a great new idea for an old time favorite.  Thanks so much Brown!!",

I cooked the chicken in Griffin\u2019s Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce which is by far the best wing sauce I have ever had. I did not use a whole bottle of dressing just spooned all over the pizza on top of the cheese and chicken\u2026it came out amazing!!",

I took one commenter's advice and just spread a thin layer of it on the pizza dough which helped a lot. I also disliked how the Boboli crust tasted the first time so I picked up some fresh (but uncooked) pizza dough at the bakery section in a local market. That tasted MUCH better. I do have one caveat though with this pizza and perhaps someone can give me some useful advice. I've made this twice and both times a good quarter of an inch underneath where the cheese meets the bread is soggy and this just adds an unpleasant texture to the meal. Is there a way to get around this? For instance putting the chicken above the cheese as opposed to directly on the crust? If I could fix that one thing it would definitely bump this recipe up to 5 stars because I love the taste of it. I'd appreciate any help anyone could give!",
