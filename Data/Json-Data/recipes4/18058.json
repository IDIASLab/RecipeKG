As the daily gourmet suggested onion was added (half a Spanish onion lightly fried to soften before adding the tomato) some more fresh herbs - basil which always goes well with tomato coriander (cilantro) leaves for gentle spiciness - and omitted the salt ( there is more than enough in the stock cube). I will have no hesitation in making this again and I may try it with hot paprika!",
