My boys especially loved this rice but both my husband and I thought it could use a little spice. Me on my own thought that the butter could be cut out a bit and maybe add in something else (like pureed vegetables) to replace some of the fat. It went really well with My Mom's Parmesan Chicken which is also from this site and roasted vegetables. Very simple which this tired Mama appreciated and it used on hand ingredients. I'll make this again but play with it next time.",
