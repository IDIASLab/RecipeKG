This did not happen to me but if you think about this intuitively \u2013 what happens if you add warm vegetables to eggs?  Yes, they scramble.  With all the items this recipe calls for you to add it was nearly impossible to have patties properly form.  Those that did form did not taste anything at all like what you may receive at an Chinese recipe.  Some suggestions would be to lower the amount to stuff you are trying to stuff into these patties or increase the number of eggs.  Pan-frying only works in a sub-par way.  If one has ever seen how this dish is made in a restaurant, they do not use a pan, rather a wok with a good bit of oil.  It would not hurt also to mix in a little seasoning of some/any sort.  A little ginger root, some garlic and salt and pepper would not hurt at all. \r\n\r\nThe sauce accompaniment was not good.  With all the cornstarch it tasted just like that.  Cornstarch.  We will keep looking for a better recipe.  This one will unfortunately not get a second chance.  \r\n",

Really 2 different skillets and an oven not to mention separate mixing bowls and beating eggs for 5 minutes all in the great out doors? Oh and you bring shrimp along with you too so a really nice sized refrigerator or tons of coolers. You are quite the outdoorsman. The recipe was okay but eggs need some flavor a hint of nutmeg don't but in bell pepper(which I love but doesn't belong in this dish) don't saute onions use green onions diced. If you want to do it camping mix all the ingredients in zip lock sandwich bags individually. Then hit 1 skillet and empty sandwich bags to fry 2 at a time. Use canned brown or chicken gravy heated in can placed in boiling water that will be used for instant coffee of to clean skillet.",

Add cooked meats or chopped raw sea foods if to your taste - whatever is available. The real Secret to a world-class 'foo yun' is the SAUCE. Skip the water and use a robust stock as the base. Flavor it with toasted sesame oil garlic a little five-spice and yes especially a pinch or two of MSG. I've given only three stars here because this recipe is only the starting point and basic method. The enhancements are unlimited. If you make a more interesting sauce the end product can easily become a Five-Star dish in a flash. Be creative and just use up some leftovers! Short of over-cooking the 'foo yung' patties it is difficult to screw it up and cooks of any skill level should be able to make this with ease.",
