Dinner tonight HAD to contain turkey but I was longing for something different. This recipe is REALLY different and all of us loved it. It was such a nice break from the standard casserole recipes for leftover turkey. I didn't have peas so I left them out and I substituted walnuts for almonds (because that is what I had). After eating it this time I think I will add pineapple another time. I am always trying to increase my family's fiber intake and I was thrilled to see the numbers. By using pre-cooked bacon there was also no added fat. The ideas are endless and I was plesantly surprised by this recipe. Healthy and yummy! Thanks Doreen",

I used 4 slices of bacon ... chopped 1/2 of a huge onion, 1 stalk of celery, 1 carrot, 8 oz of fresh mushrooms ... cooked; those to soften in the bacon grease ... added the shredded turkey ... then added the almonds, I also added pine nuts and substituted dried cherries for the raisins ... I didn't let those cook long because we wanted the crunch ... I added a few TBSP's of crushed red pepper flakes for some heat, added the rice and about 1/4 cup of soy sauce to give it some more flavor ... sprinkled fresh chopped cilantro just before serving ... fantastic alternative to fried rice with lots of nice flavor surprises in it ... I think I may add some shrimp next time ... we will be eating this again!",

It was and pretty with a good mix of flavors colors and textures. Maybe not fancy enough for company but a great way to use up leftover poultry when you get tired of the post-Thanksgiving ritual of sandwiches enchiladas and soup.",
