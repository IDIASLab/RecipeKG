It was much lower in fat calories and carbs that way and my boyfriend and I both enjoyed it a lot. I had a large pumpkin already so wasn't sure how much to use in the recipe. I ended up using about 1 pound of cooked pumpkin and about 1 1/2 pounds of potatoes - it was just right for the 9\" pan. The thyme really gave the dish a great flavor and it was nice to have a non-sweet use for pumpkin!",

I used a ready made crust which was fine but wouldn't mind substituting a jazzier one. The flavor was great you could taste everything individually and together. It isn't much for the eye (hence the 4 stars) so I will probably add something with a splash of green next time. Also for vegetarians the protein levels aren't wonderfully high so some tofu marinated in a tofurkey seasoning mixture might be a good add or perhaps some shelled edamame? I will continue to play with this it's worth it. Thanks Jen!",
