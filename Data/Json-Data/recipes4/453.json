We had a few left over and they quickly went the next day. Thanks for the recipe!",

I used onion powder instead of onion salt (only b/c if salt is needed - I let us add to our individual servings) and I stirred the oil/spices in the shallow casserole dish I used until all the potatoes were coated well before popping this in the oven. Went great with our pork dinner and I'll make this again - perhaps playing with the amt of spices a tad until my daughter's tastebuds can handle this spicier sidedish. Thanks a bunch Krista!",
