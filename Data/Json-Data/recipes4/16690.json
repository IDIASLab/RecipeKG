I did not buy 3 as recipe called for but 1 large which was the perfect amount. The eggplant took the longest cause even in my large fry pan I could only cook 4 slices at a time. Only two issues with recipe. 1) the eggplant absolutely soak up any Olive oil brushed on and therefore didn't cook properly. At first I added Olive oil to pan but given all the slices it would have used a lot. So I opted to use cooking spray when I flipped them as well as before adding a new slice to pan- this worked well. 2) in my opinion and my family's needed more sauce. I suspected such so I made a pan sauce loosely on the ingredients for the sauce for casserole (I added chicken broth a tad chicken granules and more tomato paste and herbs). Served in bowl at table for people to add if they wished. Glad I made it! Overall delicious! I will likely make again but perhaps streamline steps better. (Oh and I removed foil last 10 min of cooking).",

I also swapped out the pasta for barley which made a very tasty and healthy substitution (added extra water at the bottom of the casserole for the barley to soak up). Definitely plan on making this again but would probably skip some of the pre-prep.",
