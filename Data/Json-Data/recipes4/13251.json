Store in the pantry for up to 1 month and in the refrigerator for up to 3 months. I also didn't have any creme fraiche so I used heavy whipping cream and one word for this: YUMMY!!!My boyfriend and I could not get enough of this!! Please try this you will not regret it!!!!",

There wasn't a whole lot of flavor at least not as robust as what we get at our local Indian restaurant. So I added an additional 1/2 t. garam masala 1/2 t. chili powder and 1 T. tomato paste. Made all the difference! Also I couldn't find creme fraiche so I substituted 1/4 c. cream and 1/4 c. sour cream. If you like Indian food you'll love this.",

Next time I make it with pork I'll reduce the cooking time since the pork turned out a little dry - but the sauce made up for it no worries. The chicken turned out perfect - I can't wait to make it with lamb! I also doubled the amount of tomato paste. Instead of water and creme fresh I only used one glass of 1% fat milk. The taste is just as great! I also used more of the spices for taste and added about one teaspoon coriander powder. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe it's a keeper!",

After browing the lamb I drained off all but 2T of the fat but then as it cooked there wasn't enough liquid. I added more cream to compensate. After tasting about 1/2 way through I added salt another Tbsp of tomato paste. It definitely improved after adding the honey cream & cilantro to finish. Don't leave any of those out. The end product was tasty but I'll tweak it with add'l spice next time and maybe use chicken or shrimp.",
