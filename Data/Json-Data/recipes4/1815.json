The last time I made them (two days ago) I measured the oil to make sure that I was just using one Tbsp. and  they came out perfectly, as usual.  I also tried adding the dijon mustard to the sour cream.  Excellent recommendation! I liked the different flavor it added.  I have made these cutlets several times since posting the recipe and I always have spectacular results, the breading doesn't ever stick or fall off of mine.  Everyone has different cooking techniques, and my approach has never failed me.    \nMy family likes these a lot, but I don't think I've ever said they are \"to die for.\" lol  Not many foods get that comment from me---and it would definitely be for something more sinful than Turkey. :o) \nDifferent strokes for different folks, but if you like turkey cutlets, I'd bet you'll like these ones. :o)",

I was very leary to use sour cream - but I followed others advice and stirred in Grey Poupon mustard with some 'herbs de provence' seasoning and - wow!!!  Instead of using regular bread crumbs - I used Panko crumbs and it was really crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside!!!  I did fry them in a pan to get them golden brown, then transferred to the oven until they were done.  That seemed to keep the breading on nicely - make sure you put a little cooking spray in teh pan before you put in the turkey so they just slide right out!  Very easy and VERY good!!!  thanks",

I also used Kellogg's Corn Flakes crumbs instead of seasoned bread crumbs.  I think those two are the secret. The flakes stayed on because the regular sour cream was thicker, and the corn flakes were crispier. I pounded the cutlets to about half their original thickness and added Grey Poupon to the sour cream for a little added zing.  I only needed the 1 T of olive oil, and these truly were a treat. What was left over from the night before made fantastic sandwiches the next day. Very satisfying!",

I mixed up sour cream a little mayo and a little dijon and spread it on both sides of the cutlets... let them sit in the fridge before breading them. I also let them sit on a rack for about 15 mins after dredging. It's true that getting the oil nice and hot before dropping them is the key to getting the breading to stick. I used panko instead of Italian breadcrumbs and to the panko and cheese I added garlic powder onion powder sage thyme salt and pepper. The flavor was outstanding and they were sooo good with mashed pototoes gravy stuffing and green beans.",

Although my breading fell off with the first three cutlets the fourth one came out very nice and crunchy and I think it's because it didn't fit in the pan the fourth cutlet sat for a few minutes before cooking so I think that next time I'll let the breaded cutlets sit for a few minutes before cooking them. I added the dijon mustard to the sour cream and it was good. The turkey cutlets that I used were kind of thick not too much but not as thin as the recipe calls for and I cooked them a little bit longer and they were very moist and I salvaged most of the breading and even then the tukey cutlets were good. I gave 4 stars because of the breading falling off but I will try this again.",
