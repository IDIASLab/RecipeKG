Omitted the EVOO all together...just browned my meat potatoes and onions and drained off what little grease there was. Added a 14.5 can of diced tomatoes in sauce doubled the other spices and added 2 more chopped tomatoes and let this simmer to help with the 'raw' potato issue. Omitted the water altogether. I also added eggplant. Salted the eggplant first and placed in a colander w/weight on top to squeeze out that bitter juice. Rinsed off and sauteed in EVOO and layered the meat/potato mixture and eggplant. It was amazing how much this smelled like gyro meat while it was cooking and also tasted a bit like it too. Loved the easy yogurt sauce in place of the harder to make Bechamel. Sprinkled the top of the yogurt sauce w/a little nutmeg to make it more like a traditional Bechamel sauce found on Moussaka. Covered at first then the last ten minutes took the lid off. The potatoes were completely done. Also only used 2 potatoes and 1 larger eggplant.",

                "reviewBody": "I served this recipe to a group of Turks and Bulgarians. I didn't tell them what I was making and I am American so when one of them took a bite and said \"Oh my god! You made Mmusaka!\" I could not have been more pleased. One lady didn't even believe it was my first time making it. The thing is that I ended up adding about three times the amount of paprika and twice the cumin and cayenne pepper in order to make it come out with what I consider enough flavor. But then I (and most Bulgarians and Turks) like strong flavor. Next time I will also add about three times the Chubritsa (summer savory) which I found at a mediterranean grocery store because I could not taste it at all in the dish. I boiled the potatoes for about 15 minutes before cooling them in cold water then peeled and cubed them. I used about 12 ounces of plain homemade tomato sauce. I drained the meat after cooking and found the amount of olive oil called for in the recipe to be way too much; 2 tablespoons is plenty for browning the beef. I also added a little less water to the mix prior to baking. Even though I had to modify the ingredients significantly I am going to give this recipe 4/5 stars because my Turkish boyfriend is still bragging to all his friends about my cooking because of it:-) One more note: the Turkish version of this recipe definitely calls for eggplant which can be bought sliced and canned from wherever you buy the chubritsa. Thanks for sharing this recipe Lisa!",

I substituted some of the ground beef with mushrooms and onions maybe that was a mistake. The dish was not very flavorful although it was interesting. This recipe has promise but it needs further instruction and more flavor more spices maybe more tomato sauce or extra diced tomatoes. I'll give it one more shot.",
