However, the inside of the roll, while it \"appeared\" to be completely cooked thru, still had a moist mouth-feel. I returned them to the oven and cooked an additional 20 minutes, then after I turned off the oven I left them in the oven to continue to dry out for another 10 minutes. No help at all. The inside is a wet, dough-y texture and, while the flavor of the crust is good, I can't get past the inside texture. I might try again, making the rolls about half the original size. But as is, this recipe is a complete fail.",
