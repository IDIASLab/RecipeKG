I decided to peel the eggplant, slice as directed, and then toss in salt and let stand in a colander for about 30 mins (to pull water out of the eggplant). I was surprised by how much liquid came out and I'm really glad that I added this step because my end product was just barely dry enough to be firm underneath my toppings. If I would have skipped the salting I think my pizzas would have been mushy. I topped mine with lots of cheese, bacon, and sausage...piled on high. Delicious. Thanks for sharing.",

I'm a college student, so cooking anything is a big deal and this recipe was easy enough for me to follow and not screw up hahaha! I pre-salted half of them to remove the water, and it did not need it. My variations on the recipe: \n1. added garlic powder with the parmasean \n2. used pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce\n3. used mozzarella cheese\n4. topped it with diced tomatoes and spinach\n\nServed it with a spinich side salad with feta cheese and raspberry dressing.
