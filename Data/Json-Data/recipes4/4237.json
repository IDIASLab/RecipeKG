Even though a whole lasagna takes a while to eat in my house by kids are happy with the leftovers the whole time:)",

I threw in 2 garlic cloves with the onions 2 eggs with the ricotta (I've never made lasagna without egg and decided not to try it) and used baby spinach. I used Hodgson Mills ww lasagna noodles and cheap store brand sauce. I did have some problems with assembly the spinach/ricotta was hard to spread and I ran out after 2 layers. I ran out of meat sauce as well after two layers. I skipped the top ricotta layer and meat layers (which I actually prefer to do anyway) and used some extra sauce I had in the cupboard for the top. I think when I make it again I will not combine things - I will pour plain sauce layer ground turkey layer ricotta/egg mixture lay spinach leaves across the ricotta and then sprinkle mozerella. With these changes I will definitely make it again.",

I used about 4 cloves of garlic instead of the garlic powder and probably only 3 cups or so of the spinach. I think any more than that would have been way too much. I also replaced the mushrooms with green bell pepper (I don't like mushrooms). In a traditional lasagna you add egg to the ricotta so that's what I did but I'm not sure I needed it since it was fat free the cheese was already pretty soft. Also instead of layering the mozzarella I mixed it in with the ricotta and grated in some fresh parmesano reggiano. I only got two layers out of it with the turkey and ricotta but it was plenty. And not so bad reheated the next day.",
