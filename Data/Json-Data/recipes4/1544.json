Making this on a tortilla is definitely easier but it tastes more authentic on flat bread (which is much more time consuming.) I moved from CA to UT and can't find ground lamb anywhere here. I made this recipe with beef and it still tasted good but I prefer the lamb. I didn't follow the recipe exactly but I felt the mixture of spices was pretty accurate. By the way: I love rolling Lahmahjoon up with lettuce and tomatoe in the middle. It makes a great sandwich.",

My grocery store doesn t carry ground lamb so I bought a pair of lamb chops cut them up and pulsed the meat in a food processor for a couple seconds. It worked wonderfully. I used the bones to make a stock for the Armenian Lentils recipe also found on this site. I debated on making some flatbread from scratch but opted instead for whole wheat tortillas. The tortillas were on the small side so it worked best when we just folded them over like a taco as opposed to stacking them and slicing like a pizza. The hubby was very impressed; and my children ages 7 3 and 2 asked if I would make this for dinner every night. That s a keeper!",

My great grandmother always made it on an extremely flat bread she made from scratch- it was like a soft cracker similar to boraghatz (spelling?).

Used more chopped peppers (red and green) cause I had them & needed to use them up. Instead of the parsley used 1 full bunch of cilantro finely chopped. Added more cumin (3/4-1 tablespoon) 2 tablespoons of mint. 1 lb pizza dough cut in 4 equal pieces (used more dough cause makes more then 4 Lahmahjoon). Sauted the onions with peppers until golden then added the garlic (oh yeah 1-2 T). Once vegies were cooked to release their flavor added the pre-cooked ground lamb. Please add salt and pepper to taste without it it will be blah. brush olive oil lightly over the doug. Spread the meat thinly over each pizza. Once baked sprinkle some lemon juice over the top. Yummy in our tummies is what my family experienced. My husband is Armenian and he couldn't stop eating it & remarked on how close it is to an Armenian store which we've bought these from located in Watertown MA.",
