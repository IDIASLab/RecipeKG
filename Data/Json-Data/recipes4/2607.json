Wrapped 1 and a half slices of bacon around it and secured with toothpicks. Then made a marinade with Webers Chipotle Marinade mix. Pored the marinade over the pork with the bacon wrapped around it and let that marinade for around half hour. Then cooked on the grill with our favorite red bbq sauce since we don't have mustard based sauces here. It was so good! Even my daughter that isn't fond of pork liked it! Thanks!",
