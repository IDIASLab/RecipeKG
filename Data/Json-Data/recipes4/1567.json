In a separate pot I added an egg with the chicken stock and heated until thickened. Then I added the leeks & onions to it. I cut up the ham slices and layered it along with the cubed chicken and the leek mixture. Instead of using pie crust I used puff pastry and just laid it across the top of the casserole. I turned the heat up to 375 degrees F. Next time I think I'll try making this in a 9x13 and covering the entire top with puff pastry so that each serving has its own little piece of puff!",

My Mistake. The other reviewers have it right! I made a roux with the liquids I poured off and served it as a sauce over the remainder and it was quite good. I made it in an Oval stoneware dish and there was way way more than 6 servings with the ingredients it called for. I had leftovers that just wouldn't fit. Could easily do two pie pans. I like the whole shredded chicken approach mixing dark and light meat for flavors. I would definitely cut back to 2 leeks medium size and don't cut into the green at all. Sauteing in a little butter before hand with the onion also (cut back on that a bit too...) would render the whole pie a bit easier to fit in the dishes. Adding some other veg - peas/carrots even a pt of potato might work to help thicken the liquids. Someone mentioned flouring the chicken first - Depending on your chicken prep that would be good too. I think a Tbs or two dusted over would be enough to skip a prepared roux. You'll have butter from the sautee-ing but definitely cut back on the liquids. I'd say 1/2c of chicken broth and 1/2 c cream - added up front not after baking might do it - and then prepare a sauce with remaining liquids with a roux... just in case! Also the puff pastry sounds like a nice alternative. But even a pre-made crust will do. I just prefer making my own. Good Luck",
