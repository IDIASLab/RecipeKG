Also modified slighly so casserole's layers are a bit more distinct, vs all mixed together, per the following: Don't cook ziti the full time. Instead, only cook 1/2 the required time. The ziti will finish cooking in the oven. In the meantime, first beat the egg, then mix egg w/the ricotta & 1/3 of the amt. of the cheeses. Add 1/3 cup fresh minced parsley & 1/8 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp salt to ricotta mixture. Drain half cooked ziti,then combine w/ricotta. Fill casserole dish by beginning w/a layer of sauce, then a layer of ziti/ricotta, some sauce, then some cheese, repeat, ending w/a bit of cheese on top.  I have also combined a bit of extra parmesan w/3/4 cup breadcrumbs, then placed this as the final layer.  It adds a bit of nice texture to the final casserole.  Rather than make a very saucy casserole, I serve extra sauce on the side, for those who want more.",

Some people have suggested using sour cream, but you have to have ricotta cheese to make baked ziti!!!  Some people have also said that there is too much cheese.  But baked ziti is part cheese!!!  You have to like cheese to enjoy it.  Try this recipe it is amazing!!!",

It tasted the same, just isn't as \"pretty\". I did have to use a BIG bowl to mix the ingredients in, I mean BIG:-)",

I've made this dish for years with a few adjustments, because it does have too much cheese.   I only use 15 ounces of ricotta.  Instead of mixing 1 pound of mozzarella with the noodles, I only mix about 2 handfuls.  Just enough to see it melt, but not overpowering.  Then I sprinkle the remaining mozzarella on top of the spaghetti sauce before putting it in the oven.  This way I can monitor how much cheese I've got.  Try these adjustments and I bet you'll give this 5 stars!  (By the way, you can always add meat, mushrooms, etc.)",
