I added 1 cup cubed leftover roast beef 1/2 cup chopped green peppers 1/2 cup sliced carrots 1 tbsp chopped cilantro to the cooked \"base\" and simmered for another 30 minutes. Topped it with chopped fresh cilantro and served it with crisp tortilla chips orange wedges and red grapes. I sometimes use a soup similar to that utilizes cauliflower as the \"base \" then add chopped ingredients to increased variety of texture and flavor. However I am happy to know that Chayote can be used in the same way. Having read other comments I first simmered \"immersed\" chayotes in water for an hour cut them (after cooling a spell) into about 5 rings each then easily removed the skins manuevering quickly around each ring with a paring knife (took less than 2 minutes). I used a food processor to puree the chayotes before adding them to the sauteed onion mixture and broth.",

So I did what I do, and checked out allrecipes.  This recipe looked worth a try.  I had everything here, enough in fact, to make a double batch.  Oh, am I ever glad I did!  I used the immersion blender right in the Donabe, and it came out delicious and creamy.  I not only think it will be better after being in the fridge a while, I see using it in many of my recipes!  It's not just a soup, this is going to help enchiladas, tacos, spaghetti sauce, pot roasts...  A definite keeper!  I guess cheap, easy and healthy aren't all that bad after all.  :)  it doesn't taste like any of the above.  It tastes like a splurge!",

I took other reviewers' tips into consideration and added one jalapeno. Since I don't enjoy food that is extremely spicy this was perfect for me. I also realized when I began cooking that I had no red pepper so I substituted in a bit of ground cayenne pepper. With this and the jalapeno there was a slight \"hot\" flavor after you swallowed and then it was gone; it didn't linger in my mouth. The only con is that it is a very unattractive green color so it could be hard to get picky eaters to try this soup.",
