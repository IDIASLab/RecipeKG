I just seasoned the meat to my taste adding just a little extra pepper & onion powder and used all the liquid from the canned tomatoes. I also added a level tablespoon of sugar & salt to taste after adding all liquids. Omitted the frozen vegetables and just served with white rice and drizzled some of the liquid on the rice.

I added garlic powder italian seasoning and chili peppers to give it a little kick. I also did not have oinion powder so I added real oinions to dish while sauteing the chicken. Added chick peas and sliced black olives (b/c I love these in tomato dishes) I also doubled the chicken as dish has too much tomato for my family's tastes. I also did not add the chicken stock and just put the whole can of tomato in. I just let the whole thing simmer to reduce the liquid and make the dish thicker. Thank you very much for the submission this was yummy!",

I didn't have any chicken broth on hand so I used 2 cups of water a carrot a piece of celery and an onion cut into big chunks; just fish out the chunks before serving. I also added salt. I think next time I'll also add a can of tomato paste. But all in all this is a fantabulous recipe.",
