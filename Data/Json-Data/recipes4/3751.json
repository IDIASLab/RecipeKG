My buffalo-wing-loving husband said he definitely wants me to make them again. (His rating was 4 1/2 stars, because he'd never give anything a \"perfect score\"...but for him, this is as close as it gets. :)  The skin had just the right crispness, but the meat was definitely not dried out.  We had ranch, more Frank's hot sauce, and celery on the side.",

I moistened the paste to allow it to coat the wings with Frank's Hot Sauce, and to make it easier, I just put the wing pieces in a medium stainless steel bowl, scraped the coating over the wings and tossed them with my hands. Oven rack in the lower middle and at 375 degrees they were done in 45 minutes. I also turned them half way through. Definitely recommend.",
