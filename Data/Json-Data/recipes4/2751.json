This recipe was great because I got rid of both and my kids were happy. I used real cheese and added some italian seasoning to the sauce. I did do three nuggets on each bun, six just wouldn't fit on one bun. You kind of have to mush the sandwich together to get the nuggets to stick into the bread with the sauce, so it dosen't all goosh out the sides. (I had two kids to feed, anyhow.) My kids were overjoyed with this lunch. According to my oldest, I rock. And the little one made devil horns at me. Thanks for the idea, recipe submitter.",

I used a mini-sub roll which allowed three nuggets to fit comfortably. While waiting for the nuggets to cook I arranged a slice of deli cut provolone cheese on one half of the sub roll. I then placed the cooked nuggets on the cheese topped with about 2 tablespoons of pasta sauce topped with shredded mozzarella cheese and Italian seasoning. I then nuked everything for about 30 seconds until the mozzarella had melted. It was the perfect snack/light dinner. Thanks for the inspiration.",
