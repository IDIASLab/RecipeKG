I had to give them a 4 star for now just because the filling was a might too sweet for my taste--even though most of the others tasting these enjoyed them as they were. I will definitely make them again but decrease the amount of powdered sugar by at least 1 cup. I tested them before freezing and after. Much better after they have been frozen--The texture and flavors are better. I used parchement paper as a liner for the baking pan with great results. This allowed me to bake one cake pull it right out of the pan onto a cooling rack and then bake the second 1/2 of the cake portion of the recipe--since I only have one jelly roll pan at this time. I like the idea from Kathy W's review to use them as a shortcake base.",

I also took the advice of others and cut the filling recipe in half. It was way more than enough (too much!) to fill 12 cupcakes and 8 Twinkie-like little loaves. The cake was spot on though and the filling delicious with the omission of the cream cheese. Do let these get cold in the refrigerator before eating. Thanks Tyler for a great base recipe.
