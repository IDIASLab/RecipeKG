Added water through out basting. Tender meat great sauce with the noodles amazing taste! Thanks for the recipe:)",

Flavor wise - Nana Lara's is the winner in our family. The rub makes a huge difference which encrusts the brisket and gives it a slightly more tender edge. The soy/pineapple combo brings a yummy flavor. For this wine-braised recipe the tomato/wine flavor didn't really permeate into the flavor of the meat. So if you prefer a less sweet brisket you'd probably like this one better.",

I used our homemade beef stock in place of broth, which I personally think put this over the top.  Instead of basting, I turned the brisket over every 45 min or so (total 4 times). There was no need to reduce gravy as it cooked down to a a perfect consistency; just enough to flavor the buttered noodles I served this with. I honestly wish I could have rated it higher, and my family agrees.  lol",

Then, because I fiddle with all recipes, I added about 1/4th teaspoon of liquid smoke, tamari, and garlic powder. They weren't necessary, because the beef was delicious anyway. My family will be on my case to make this again - soon! It's a delicious, simple recipe.",
