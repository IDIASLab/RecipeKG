These were only \"eh.\" They really needed some sort of seasoning (salt at the very least but even after I salted them they weren't fantastic). They may have managed a 3 star review if they weren't also a lot of trouble to make. Tip for anyone who is still planning to try them.... don't go to too much trouble to make the thinnest dough possible. I had probably 3 times as many dough rounds as I needed (I put those in the freezer to make ravioli or something with in the future) and the completed pierogies didn't hold up very well. The last 5-6 I put together were fine but the ones that had been sitting there longer fell apart due to the moisture from the beets soaking through the dough. If you do want a really thin dough definitely get your water boiling ahead of time and drop the pierogies in as you go instead of waiting to boil them until they're all put together.",

I changed the recipe a bit which made it significantly better this time. First I doubled the dough recipe and used whole wheat AP flour. I kept the same amount of beets and added 1/2 lb of lean ground beef. I made the beets as recommended but added in sage and salt. I cooked the ground beef in a pan with garlic and pepper. Then I mixed the beets and beef together in a bowl and proceeded to roll out fill and boil as stated. After boiling I plan fried the pierogies in butter and sage before serving with sour cream.
