My hubby loved this. It reminded him of his mother's cooking. It was too sweet for me - but that is just my taste. The honey & vinegar glaze would be great on chicken wings or boneless wings (Is there really such a thing as boneless wings?) Why did I mark it down one star? It is messy took longer than the stated time and the recipe really needs to have you dip the chicken into either buttermilk or egg wash prior to the flour dredge in order for the coating to stick. NOTE: Once you place the chicken in the oil - let it sit and cook until good and crispy before attempting to turn it. Otherwise the coating will fall off. Will I make this again - probably not. I am I glad I made it? You bet!",

I just fried it like I normally would fry chicken which is pretty much turn it once. Someone mentioned messy. I didnt find it extra messy to fix. You mix up the honey mixture and then pour it over the chicken. Easy peasy. DH said it is a keeper and I agree. Thanks for sharing!",
