I used Green Giant's yellow and white corn, Cracker Barrel's 2% white cheddar and added a little dijon and Frank's Hot Sauce. Very good \"tuna\" casserole. I liked that it helped me use some stray cans of food in my pantry plus I could throw in some fresh veg and get away with it. I think next time I might cut back on the noodles and double up on the veg. Maybe make a little more sauce as we like a saucier cheese sauce on our mac and cheese/tuna casseroles. I think this might be our new \"tuna\" casserole, Pixie! My husband, who claims to hate salmon, ate two bowls! EDITED: Even better the next day. Rewarms well.",

So I added a can of cheddar-cheese soup and extra 2% milk (about 2 cups). And we like Parmesan but thought it might be too much with 3 full Tablespoons for my kiddie's/my family's liking... so I only used half. Great idea to add Old Bay. It added a nice depth of flavor. Delicious recipe Pixie that I changed only for my family's preferences. Now I can't wait to try when I have Salmon. Thank you for posting!",
