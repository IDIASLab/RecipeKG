I do suggest you make the full recipe as leftovers never last more than two days at my house. These are wonderful with a big slice of very sweet onion and catsup. Some people like to add a slice of Mozzarella cheese before popping them in the foil and before heating again.",

We dressed these simply with homemade special sauce sliced cheddar cheese sliced tomato sliced onion and fresh bibb lettuce. Out of six there is ONE left. My husband ate two in one sitting.

Three of us thought they were really tasty but my daughter thought there was too much flavor of Italian sausage - probably from the 2 teaspoons of fennel seeds. I actually used two pounds of lean ground beef and one pound of bulk sausage and used the full recipe amount of seasonings. It was too hot to grill outside so I grilled them on my stovetop pan and then finished in the oven. After putting the cooked meat patties on sub rolls I added sauteed red peppers and onions and provolone cheese wrapped in foil and heated for 15 minutes. My daughter added pesto to hers after it came out of the oven. I don't think serving them on the bun is necessary. They would be good covered in grilled veggies and shredded cheese and heated in the oven until the cheese melted.",
