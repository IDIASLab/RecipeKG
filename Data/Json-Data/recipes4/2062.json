After heating on the stove for about 40 minutes I added 1 cup of coarsely chopped onion 1 Tbsp. minced garlic 1 tsp each of dried basil and oregano to ONE HALF of the recipe and it tasted much more like I had hoped though I think the ratio of basil to oregano needs to be tweaked. I would also recommend frying the turkey sausage before starting the sauce because it was rather lumpy even though I took care to add it to the sauce in small raw chunks.",
