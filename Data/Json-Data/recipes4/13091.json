Luckily I had extra artichokes, but I just added some ketchup and a tad more water to make up for more tomatoes. (I only did this to add ~ one serving. Not sure if it would work on a larger scale.)\n\nI also served over rice instead of pasta because of my gluten allergy.\n\nEveryone RAVED though. Tomatoes and lentils are a great combo, and artichokes add the perfect something extra!",

This is a very good recipe...I tweaked it a tiny bit to our taste: Try with sauteed garlic, minus the green onions and substitute finely minced sweet spanish onion.
