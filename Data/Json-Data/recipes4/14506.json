I added some corn and kidney beans to this and a little molasses; and instead of 1 cup of tomato paste I added a can plus some homemade stewed tomatoes. Also this states to cook it for 8 hours; and I'm sure that would be even more delicious--but I only cooked it for about an hour (for a week night meal) and it's still very good. So don't overlook this recipe because it states a long cooking time---it's not necessary to cook it 8 hours but it would still be fine if you did I'm sure.",
