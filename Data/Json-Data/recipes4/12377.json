So when I made it the second time I doubled all the ingredients for the sauce and I think it turned out pretty good. I'll probably try and tweak it just a little more but its a good recipe! Thank you for posting this!! my husband went on a mission to China and so loves all Asian food and he really enjoyed it!",
