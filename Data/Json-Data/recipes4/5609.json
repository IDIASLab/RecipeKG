First I added equal parts sweet onion and green pepper, salt and pepper to begin to sweat them down.  I increased the garlic to 3 cloves (about 1 1/2 tsp minced garlic) which I then added to the onion and peppers after about 6 minutes and cooked about 30 seconds.  I then added 2 heaping T of tomato paste to the onion, peppers and garlic and cooked for a couple of minutes.  I added the ground turkey and cooked just through and then added 3/4 can of 28oz tomato sauce.  I didn't drain the turkey cause I used very lean turkey.  I then added about 1/2 tsp ground oregano and a heaping tsp of basil, salt and pepper to taste instead of the Italian seasoning.  I used 1 1/3 boxes of tri-colored rotini, cooked about 6 minutes which I added to a bowl with 4oz chive cream cheese and parsley and blended until coated.  I then added the turkey mixture to the bowl, 1 1/2 cups mozarella and mixed.  I poured them into a sprayed 13x9 dish and topped with 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese and baked for 20 minutes at 375. It was a big hit with the family.",

I like that the cream cheese mixture made the pasta not dry or hard in the oven. Leaving the mozzarella for the top created a nice cheesy layer too. I used lean ground turkey lite whipped cream cheese and reduced fat mozzarella and milk. I only had corn pasta in the house so I had to use that. Although I found the taste mixture of it not the best and it was a little heavy. I definitely recommend the pasta suggested. I didn't bother to heat the cream cheese mixture to save on dishes. I just dumped the hot drained pasta into that bowl and stirred. I did calculate the calories and not sure if it was the change in pasta type however I got 467 calories per serving. Probably not a repeat dish but it used what I had in the house and for that I am greatful. ty",
