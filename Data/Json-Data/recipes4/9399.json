Savory yet hearty this easy recipe should please the palate and satisfy the hungriest of family or guests.

We usually use fresh sweet potatoes instead of canned and serve with an extra green veggie or salad.",

But it was still lacking more side features. The chicken was very flavorful. It just seemed like I could have laddled this over something. But what? (not another starch!) There was quite a bit of soupy liquid. I will try this again my husband loves sweet potatoes but his only exposure was candied.... at the holidays. His palate is expanding!
