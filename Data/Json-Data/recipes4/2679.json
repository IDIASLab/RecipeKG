I wrapped it all up and grilled on medium heat for 50 min, turning once.\n\nThese came out tender, flavorful, and buttery!

Did fry up some bacon and cumbled some into the mix. I doubled the butter. Went camping fried it up. Did add 6 whipped eggs to it during the last 7 minutes of frying. Served it with cheese and some left over Carne Asade meat from the night before (tore it into bite size pieces). We made \"Camping Breakfast Burritos\" out of this. Warmed up a large flour tortilla. Then added what you want chopped onion chopped cilantro or salso. Or Ketchup as my son likes it. This is a keeper!!!!!",
