Cut the water in half to make it thicker and heartier, and added a dash of cinnamon.  We are definitely saving this recipe - it is the best we've tried so far!\nEdit: I've made this a second time now, this time in the slow-cooker.  We did not change anything except to add a little more water.  We left it on low for the day (8 hrs).",

Once softened, add the turkey and brown. Add spices and cook together for a minute or two. Add 1 can diced tomatoes, beans (I use a can of whole kidney beans, no mashing), and chicken broth to cover. Let it simmer for as long as you can for delicious chili! \n\nThere are so many ways to make this basic chili exactly as you like it!",
