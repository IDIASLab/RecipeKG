( I had other things baking at the time so I couldn't use my oven) I baked them longer than called for in the recipe as I like my bacon brown and slightly crisp. I accidentally forgot the last batch and the bacon burned....but even that didn't hurt these things! They were still delicious! Thanks Machenzie!",
