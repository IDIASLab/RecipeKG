I initially under seasoned this, but that was easily fixed. If you use a pressure cooker to make this be sure to place the chicken on the bottom and layer tomato sauce on top, otherwise the sugars in the tomato sauce will burn. My pressure has a feature that automatically turns pressure setting off if this happens. The chicken was so tender that I decided to remove chicken from the bone and will serve with tomato sauce over couscous for dinner. I find my kids don't waste as much chicken if I debone it. I kept picking bites of it, which is a sign of a good recipe to me! Reminds me of a chicken tagine, and I'll serve it with a side of steamed carrots.",
