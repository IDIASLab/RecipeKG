I liked it, it reminded me of home, not so much my home, but of high school. Family liked it and we are ging to have it again. I've never had it with beer, I just used milk and some cream. ",

This was not picante-hot so most or all children who like cheese & bread will like this. This can easily be made with either all milk or all beer but the 2 together are especially tasty. Best when eaten immediately as the leftover sauce quickly became cold & more solidified. I lightly toasted ciabatta bread slices (1/2 inch thick) then put the solid sauce on top to reheat in the microwave for about 45 seconds. It was good. Next time I'll probably sprinkle in some chipotle or red chile powder because I like that spicy flavor rather than increase the vinegary hot pepper sauce.",

I made it pretty much exactly as written, but used a 16 ounce block of cheddar, chopped into pieces, and an extra 1/4 cup of beer (Yuengling porter- its what was in the fridge).  Although this recipe is considered a meal, I placed it in a fondue pot and used it as an appetizer.  Most fondue separates into oil and milk solids which you need to keep stirring, but Welsh Rarebit does not separate in a fondue pot, even after several hours.  If I ever need a fondue recipe I will come here, rather than get a real fondue.",

My daughter ate it as written. My husband and I like it a little spicier so we sprinkled red pepper on our individual portions. We served it over toasted French bread. As soon as we tasted it my husband got out the tortilla chips to try with it. It reminded me of cheese fondue so I tried it over an apple slice. We both thoroughly recommend it served those ways as well. Good job Momfish! Thanks for the great recipe!",
