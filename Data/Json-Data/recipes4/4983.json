I used vegetarian beans and diced toms.with garlic and onions. I also added some chopped celery. I also used dried beans since that is what I prefer for texture, and they hold up better in chili than canned. A great, tasty, and quick recipe. Thanks for sharing!",

Also, I did this in a crockpot instead of stovetop.  I sauteed the garlic, onions and ground turkey (salt, pepper and garlic powder on the turkey before cooking to season it).  I put the rest of the ingredients in the crockpot first and mixed together.  after the turkey is cooked, I added the mixture to the crockpot, mixed and cooked on high for 4 hours (or low for 8 hours).  I also  I left out the Kidney beans (because I do not like them)... and it turned out fine without them.  I also added a can of corn to give it a little color. Great recipe!  My son ate 3 bowls!!",
