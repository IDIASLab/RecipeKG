This one sounded healthy and different. It made a huge mess on my stove was a lot of work and just bland. The second half I added some parmesan cheese (about 1-2 tablespoons) and about 1/4 cup of mozzarella hoping to make them stick together. Also added some herbs to up the flavor. Then I baked them in a 350 oven for 20 minutes flipped them and baked another 20 to 25. FINALLY they stuck together. But still rather bland. Maybe a bit of garlic and cayenne would have helped.",

Followed Elise's recipe almost exactly trying sourdough bread crumbs and prepping the batter the night before moist but not really wet. I tried to use my waffle plates on the combo grill because some folks had been saying the fritters fell apart. It fell apart in the waffle iron too but was nicely browned on the edges. Added a small dollop of creme fraiche and a touch of dried tarragon and I'll tell you what it stood up to the heavily seasoned steak my hubby grills! Even crumbly as mine was it would have made an impressive stuffing for maybe a cornish game hen! With a nutty flavor this was something different that we both enjoyed.",

Perhaps some garlic Parmesan cheese and bit of flour would help it hold together and have a taste beyond bland. It is very good looking with some pimentos and parsley added. The hazelnuts were expensive and added no taste but a nice crunch. I'm glad I test drove it before serving it to guests. I think I'll add it to a casserole for filler rather than dispense those great ingredients. It just didn't have the taste to match its presentation.",
