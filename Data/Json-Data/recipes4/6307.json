To thicken it up a bit at the end and to add more of the salt factor I added some Queso Quesadilla. It adds an amazing background flavor along with a little creaminess.

I had everything but the green salsa, so I improvised with what I did have and threw in a can of ranch style beans with jalapenos. I upped the oregano to 3/4, added a packet of dry ranch, and added some garlic for flavor. Put it on high for 4 hrs, and came home to deliciousness! Served with shredded sharp cheddar, sour cream, and warm flour tortillas. It was awesome! Would recommend to anyone. I'm sure if mine was thrown together and improvised that the original version with green salsa is even more delicious.",

The only thing I changed was the amount of chicken broth. I used about a can and a half because I like my chili a little more chunky. I also used 'chili ready' tomatoes instead of diced with peppers (which I think are still about the same thing anyway). However, mine didn't turn out like the rest of the pictures show. It's definitely more on the red side rather than white like it looks here. After adding the cheese and sour cream to my bowl, along with crushed tortilla chips, it looked more like the picture. I turned my crock pot on at 9pm and left it on low. At about 6:30 the next morning I stirred it up and turned it to warm. The taste- AMAZING! I was actually surprised because I've never made chili before so I didn't know what to expect. Super easy and super tasty. Mine isn't that spicy (probably because I didn't use the rotel tomatoes) but I don't prefer spicy anyway. Definitely a great recipe!",

My general impression of this recipe is that it is an excellent and very versatile 'base' to start with; you can easily modify it with lots of different additions to make it *just like you like it*. The flavor and consistency reminded me more of tortilla soup than chili, but the beans make it chili. It would be excellent with any kind of 'Mexican' or Tex-Mex foods like tortilla chips, sour cream, avocado, black beans, etc. or cheeses like cheddar or Monterrey jack. I admit that I'm a wimp when it comes to all things spicy-hot, and I hate onions. Obviously I skipped the onions, and I also used mild Rotel and only a small 7 ounce can of salsa verde. That made the spice just right for me--very tasty but not overwhelming.  I love cumin and oregano so I really heaped them up in the measuring spoons. Otherwise I prepared it according to directions and loved it. Its not something I'll make once a week, but I'll keep it in the recipe box to make every once in a while. It's good comfort food, and incredibly easy and versatile.",
