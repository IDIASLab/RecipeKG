I left out the lime and anise and simmered 1 cup of milk with a cinnamon stick and some whole cloves.  When the rice was done cooking I put a strainer over the pot and poured the milk in.  I added 3-5oz cans of evaporated milk instead of 12oz and added only 3/4 of the can of condensed milk.  I sprinkled in more ground cinnamon and nutmeg too.  The vanilla and salt I added as the recipe states. I only let it simmer for about 5 minutes because we like a lot of liquid with the rice. ",
