The unique thing about THIS curry is that one day she accidentally used corned beef and it was FANTASTIC (you may use brisket beef or lamb instead), so I have adapted it to the recipe. Trust me, when you eat this beef curry you will never want to try another, it's THAT good!",

I am assuming that the recipe is based on non-corned beef and wasn't adjusted. TO ANYONE MAKING THIS DISH.....taste first at the end of cooking before adding ANY salt.",

The corned beef was underdone and tough (it should be boiled / simmer 40 minutes per pound by itself before adding other ingredients). There was a spice that was too overpowering and grainy on the tongue (turmeric maybe?). Lastly corned beef is already densely salted so it doesn't need more salt added. This recipe adds two teaspoons! So the meal was grainy with crunchy meat and salty enough to taste like the ocean.",
