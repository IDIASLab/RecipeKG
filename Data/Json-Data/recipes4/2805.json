Even my picky 12 year old daughter gobbled it up.  You can use slightly less ham to make it less salty.  You don't have to use the hot pepper sauce if you have kids eating.  It's loaded with flavour +++ with no weird ingredients that might make kids turn their noses up.   Oh, and you DON'T have to worry about letting it sit AT ALL ...that part of the recipe is only for Xmas Eve chefs who want an easy meal the next day.  YUMMMMMMM ...this will be on the table next Xmas breakfast.  SOOOO good!",

I needed a recipe to use up 1/2 a loaf of white bread and some  deli ham.  I had 1/3 loaf of Velveeta, and a chunk of Mozarella, plus some grated Parmesan.  I spayed a glass 13x19 with Pam, then put it in the oven with 1/4 cup of butter to melt before adding the rest of the ingredients (didn't add more butter).  As someone else said, layers not really necessary.  Let it sit 10 minutes after making before putting it into the oven @ 325* (with a glass pan, it will get too dark on the bottom  if you set the oven to 350*).  We had it for dinner with the Lemon Butter Broccoli from this site, and fresh sliced tomatoes.  The cheese was yummy and the eggs made it custardy.  Ummmmmm!  The whole family loved it! ",

I was worried about the large amount of ham called for especially since I was feeding a group who is trying to watch their salt intake. I found a turkey ham product that had half the sodium but the dish was still salty maybe because of the cheese. It was extremely tasty and lighter than expected. Would make again (will try a reduced-sodium cheese).",
