Also I used Italian Seasoning instead of Oregeno.  I baked the casserole at 350 for 25 minutes and then lowered the temperature to 325 for the last 20 minutes and the eggs set perfectly.  I will definitly make this again, but I might try sage sausage instead of the maple Jimmy Dean sausage that I used.  Also I cut the cheese to a total of two cups instead of four and used a blend of cheeses.",

One easy way I have found to determine if it is done is to bake it in a glass pan. When the cresent roll dough is no longer sticking all over the base of the pan and forms air pockets in between, it's done. \r\n\r\nENJOY! You will love this recipe.",

I put the bacon right in to the milk and egg mixture. Gave the crescent rolls a 5 minute head start in oven before pouring mixture over them. I baked at 350 (had other things baking) for 40 minutes and it turned out absolutely PERFECT, LOOKED PHENOMINAL,TASTED DELICIOUS  and was so easy. As others mentioned, adding other omlette ingredients could only make a great dish even greater. Thanks to all reviewers who helped me perfect this dish for my family!

I used mild italian pork sausage with 10 eggs, 3/4 cup of milk, and only 1 cup each of cheese like others suggested, and thought that was the perfect combination.  Any more cheese I think would be too much.  Also, I think that its a good idea to bake the crescent roll for about 6-8 min first before putting in the egg mixture.  Over all, this recipe was wonderful.  My younger brother loved it, and he is a picky eater.  I'm looking forward to making it for Thanksgiving and Christmas morning!",

I didn't have oregano...but I did have Italian Seasoning and I used it instead, and it flavored the casserole beautifully.  I also added about 1 to 1 1/2 tsp of salt as well.  Next time I might try sauteing a little green pepper and onion with the sausage and using Mexican Cheese Blend for a more southwestern flair.  My co-workers thank you for sharing this recipe!",
