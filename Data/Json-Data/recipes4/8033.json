I did wonder if I should have increased the egg mixture a bit but I decided it was worth taking apart my carefully arranged bread to be sure every slice had laid flat in the egg mixture and been flipped over once before arranging the bread again. There were a couple of pieces that had a touch of white left in the middle when we cut into them but not many. This was tasty and straightforward and is a breakfast worthy of serving overnight guests",

I stir up the egg mixture and dip the bread in it a slice at a time rather than trying to pour it over and then expecting all slices to get \u201ctheir fair share\u201d.  I have tried several of the French toast recipes on Allrecipes and they were all very good. Yesterday I asked my husband which one he wanted for dinner today and he said this one. Ok by me. Yum!",
