It's also huge so be prepared to have massive quantities of leftovers that no one wants. The saving grace was that I decided to fry a patty of the leftover mush in some olive oil with garlic and sage and top it with tabasco sauce pepperjack cheese and an overeasy egg. That was decent. Planning to deep-fry the remainder - its very dough-like and could be shaped around pickles or mushrooms perhaps. Saw that someone tried it with fresh salmon I would recommend giving that a shot since the mushiness seemed more like the canned salmon just disintegrated into the rice.",
