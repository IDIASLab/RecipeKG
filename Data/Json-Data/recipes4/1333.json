This recipe is more of a summer sausage than a salami. Your proportions of seasonings to curing salt is perfect. The flavor and texture are wonderul. Most people can't believe you made it yourself. Its quality is as good as any butcher and sausage maker's. Goes soooo good with beer on a hot summer day. Thanks again.",

I may use more than 1T liquid smoke next time just based on personal tastes. This doesn't last long around the house it is sooooo good. I also unwrap the meat after about 10 mins of cooling and let it sit in the turned-off oven to create a drier meat.",

After at least 24 hours place it in a deep pan (I used a stock pot) cover both logs with cold water bring it to a boil. Boil for one hour (I reduced to a simmer to keep the steam down). Drain and unwrap the foil pat the sausage with paper towels chill before slicing. Really good and I only turned the logs once in the water they kind of floated but then again I used 1/2 bison and 1/2 beef.",
