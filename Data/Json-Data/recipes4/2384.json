I used whole wheat bread sliced deli cheddar cheese and sausage patties because that was what I had on hand. You CAN have breakfast sandwiches like this but use lighter counterparts and still enjoy it just the same. HUGE hit with all of us and this was a cute new way for me to eat one of my favorite breakfast foods that I grew up eating as a child. EDITED: I like to make this sandwich with leftover french toast too (I do make my french toast \"lighter\" with whole wheat bread and partial egg whites). If you drizzle a little maple syrup in the middle it's HEAVEN.",
