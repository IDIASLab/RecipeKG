So is Salad Dressing rather than Mayo. Once you try it you will know what I mean. However this recipe is even great if you cook the rice and put that in the bottom of the casserole dish and continue with the rest of the instructions but correcting for extra needed liquid. Thanks Candie I was wondering if I could make my chicken recipe with salmon and what to change to make it work. You answered everything I needed to know. I really really like it.

A pound of salmon has 4 portions in it using the standard of 4 ozs per person. Since you are adding rice it will fill up a plate. I switched out white wine for white grape juice with a few tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. I doubled the amount of curry powder required I like a stronger curry taste. This recipe needs a little more moisture like maybe no more than 3/4 cup of water milk or cream for the 3 person recipe. This would make it easier for the rice to pick up the flavor. One last thing. This takes entirely too long to make and using the oven is not necessary to this kind of recipe here are my suggestions to speed this up a bit. - Par boil the broccoli to desired tenderness. (you can do this step while the sauce is melding below) - Add all mixed ingredients (don't forget extra fluid as I spoke about above) to a dutch oven or large sauce pan and simmer don't let it boil / burn. - After the sauce has cooked up a bit maybe 10-20 minutes throw in the salmon turn the stove off and throw the lid on for 5 mins. - Check a piece of salmon and if it is cooked through it is done. - Throw some rice on a plate add a layer of broccoli and then sauce to taste.",
