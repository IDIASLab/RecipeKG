I used red lentils, but instead of the green ones I used split peas.  Also, I added 2 Tbs. of dried chopped onion.  If you don't have poultry seasoning, you can make your own (I did) using one tablespoon each of the following:  sage, marjoram, rosemary, celery seed and thyme.  Thank you so much for this recipe- OUTSTANDING!  *UPDATE*  Every time I make this, I add 1/3 c. barley and an extra cup of water to make up for the barley.",

I considered using split peas as other reviewers mentioned however wanted to try and stay close to the original recipe. I was worried about using instant rice in this since it only takes 5 minutes to cook and lentils take so much longer. It was fine but I think regular rice would have worked just as well. The flavor was good but I think it would be better with the optional chicken and celery. Overall inexpensive easy good flavor and very pretty gifts in a jar.",
