With the 2nd batch, I combined the peanuts and cereal in a bowl and spread that over the marshmallow layer then melted the peanut butter chips, butter and corn syrup, removed from heat, stirred in vanilla and carefully drizzled that over the nut/cereal layer.  MUCH easier and they still taste great!",
