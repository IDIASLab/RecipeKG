There is a sausage pricker you can buy which sausage makers use to do this. Polish sausage to me has lots of pepper and garlic for flavor. In my sausage I don't like it too salty so I usually use 4 tsp per 5 lb. About a tbsp and a half of black pepper and half a tsp of white pepper. 6 to 8 cloves of garlic. 2 tsp of marjoram. I usually grind this into a powder at this point. I have a coffee grinder I use. Then I add about a tbsp of mustard seeds.",
