Based on some other reviews we did add some seasonings such as black pepper garlic salt onion powder and cayenne to the meat mixture to give it a little extra flavor. We also substituted navy beans for the bread crumbs in order to make it a little more diet friendly. I too was hesitant about the amount of water but it made for a very moist and delicious meatloaf. There's no way we could have fit it into a meatloaf pan so we free-formed it on an aluminum lined baking sheet but we probably could have divided it into two meatloaf pans and they still would have been good-sized. I've never made another meatloaf other than my mom's because I love hers so much but this will definitely be going into our regular rotation. Thanks for sharing!",
