The top of the chicken that was out of the liquid had great flavor the rest was VERY BORING! I used chicken breast in a smaller pan it needs more flavor. I'll play with the recipe I think the Chutney and Mayo with the Poultry Seasoning has great potential!",

Also added a little more mayo only about half the water 2 tbsp. honey and some ginger garlic onion pepper. I floured the chicken before pouring the sauce over it to thicken the sauce a bit. It turned out delicious! My whole family loved it!",
