I had to cook the catfish so it wouldn't go bad and was trying to find something easy and flavorful. We used everything BUT lime because we didn't have it on hand. It still came out really great! This also makes great leftovers. We used the juice of two lemons and had it with home made mashed potatoes as a side. Next time I will eat it on a fresh bed of salad greens for lunch. Will make this again.",

Then wrapped it in a foil packet (leaving room for air to cirulate a bit) & baked for 12 minutes checking it & did another few minutes until it was to my liking. Thanks!",
