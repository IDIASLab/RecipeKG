For those who want more bang and less meat I would suggest adjusting this recipe to include two of each bell peppers and decrease the amount of sauces to 3 quarters as there was just too much chicken and was a little too spicy for our typical Western tastes.",

The chili sauce gave it too much heat though and In my families' opinion took away from the other flavors. Next time I will try removing chili sauce maybe replace with a little ketchup and a dash of soy sauce which may make the sauce thicker. Overall quick easy reciepe (great with brown rice) will definitely try again.",
