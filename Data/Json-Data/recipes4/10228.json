Now I am just finishing with graduate school and I realize it should be tablespoons instead of teaspoons for the worchshire and steak sauce. No wonder it was bland! As with any soup though, it is all a matter of taste so add as much as you like to make it taste good. I just give them both a good shaking into the pot and often have to experiment with adding more or adding more water!",

The one thing I would do differently next time is to double the barley because I found myself hunting for it with just 1/3 cup. All in and all it is a good recipe and I really like the addition of the steak sauce. Although I feel it needs a bit of tweaking it is still a fast and hearty soup and I will make again.",
