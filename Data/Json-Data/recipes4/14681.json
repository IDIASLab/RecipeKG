My mother in law gave me a pasta sheeter a while back and I finally found time to use it! It was so fun to make. I did find that the dough needed some moisture so I added just enough 1/2and1/2 for richness to bring the dough together. Let it rest for a few minutes and it was smooth sailing from there on in! It cooked up quickly and beautifully. I love the flax meal in it too! It gave it extra texture as well as the added nutrition benefits. It looked beautiful in the dough too! The bolognese sauce was delicious. I had an over abundance of open red wine so I subbed that for the water. I added a bit of ground sweet Italian sausage as well. Just personal preference. The recipe as is would be just as yummy. I just can't seem to leave well enough alone. I always have to put my own spin on things. I will be coming back to this dish again and again. So simple yet great for guests as well. Thank you so much for sharing!",
