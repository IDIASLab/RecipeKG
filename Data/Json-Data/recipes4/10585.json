Try adding chopped, fresh parsley to the butter, and if the garlic is too strong, add that to the butter sauce, too, to mellow it out some. A few hot pepper flakes are also a nice touch if you like a little more heat. Great dish!",

If I do it again which I probably will I'll use just a little garlic powder. Great recipe thanks for sharing it!",

It is a bit unusual and I don't like how the yogurt cools the eggs down (I like hot food to be hot) but other than that I enjoyed these. Not sure what bf would think but he wasn't around for breakfast this morning so I won't worry about that. I don't know if the type of yogurt used makes a huge difference but I have plain greek yogurt so I used that and the tang was really good. I forgot the minced garlic so I just sprinkled garlic powder on top when I did remember. Otherwise I kept it the same. I made 2 eggs and ate with toast. Thanks for the recipe!",
