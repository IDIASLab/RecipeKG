I would go bigger (9 X 13 ) next time for sure. Despite my crispy edges they were very good rich and moist without being too sweet a little different than the usual brownies I make but very well received and all gone in 15 minutes! I would make these again. I've made these again a few times and found the following... Use a chocolate with 75% cacoa for the best colour they come out a rich dark brown. (55% cacoa chocolate tatsted good too but was not as appealing on the plate as the dark ones) A 9x13 pan works well but I still added 5 minutes to the baking time. The brownies also taste best when they have totally cooled. I can't wait to find another reason to bake these. Is Wednesday a good enough reason?",
