My suggestion: Leave in the lamb bones till the end then remove before serving (they enrich the flavor) and also add another meat in addition to lamb such as steak or chicken. There is no need to brown the meat for more than a minute or so because it cooks enough while simmering in the liquid for the next hour and a half. Also if you can find it add a tablespoon of tamarind paste in addition to the tomato paste.. It really boosts the flavor.",
