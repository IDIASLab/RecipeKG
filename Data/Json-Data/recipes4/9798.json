I honestly thought I'd never get to enjoy another bowl of chowder for the rest of my life, because what could possibly compare?  But thanks to this recipe, no more worries!  \r\n\r\nI added about 2 cloves garlic along with the onion, and put in about 1/2 tsp. of pepper rather than 1/8.  But otherwise I didn't mess with the recipe.  \r\n\r\nAfter 20 minutes of simmering, the potatoes were not nearly cooked through.  So I covered the pan and let it go for about 10 more minutes.\r\n\r\nExcellent, excellent recipe!",

I think it would have been better if I had cut up the veggies into smaller (corn size) pieces and maybe I'll think of additional veggies to add. I think I will make this again.
