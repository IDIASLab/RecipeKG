I made it using Spicy Bratwurst (\"Cajun\" flavor the package said) - omitted sage & thyme because (1) I didn't figure it needed additional spice with the seasonings in the brats and (2) I don't particularly care for sage & thyme. I also thought I wouldn't need to add the ketchup and mustard; but after tasting a potato decided that was just what it needed instead of just adding salt. My oh my the results were great - and I plan to make this a permanent recipe in my recipe binder. Thanks Pam for this adaptable recipe! (Bell pepper might be an addition to the next batch... and my husband is planning to enjoy the leftovers in tortillas with cheese for burritos.)",

It was very sausage-heavy (could have been better with half the sausage) and was greasy even after draining the sausage. The sauce was better than I expected but it was a dry hash. We ate this with over-easy eggs and like a previous commenter I found that the yolk added a LOT to this.. All the individual elements would have come together much better if there was more of a sauce to bind it. As is I wouldn't make it again.",

I did think the recipe was written weird though first it says heat the oil in the pan so the potatoes don't stick but you don't add the potatoes then you add the sausage and onion. Then for the sauce it calls for oil in the recipe list but for water in the directions (I used water). Still it was good. As far as a pound of potatoes and half a pound of apples I just used 3 potatoes and 2 green apples. It definitely took longer to cook the potatoes which totally stuck to the bottom of the pan but my husband loved it so 5 stars none the less. Will be making again. Oh no fresh parsly only had dried and worked fine.",

I think this recipe was written assuming you would be preparing in advance. I used two skillets - one for the potatoes and I cooked the sausage apple and onions in the other. Once the potatoes were crisp I combined the two and mixed in the ketchup mustard and water sauce. Actually I think it was the sauce that ruined this for us. One reviewer pointed out that the recipe calls for an additional 2 T. of oil - that oil would be used to coat the potatoes prior to cooking - by using two skillets I was able to omit that oil. None the less I probably would not make this again.",

It's a big dish so make sure you have a large frying pan or just dump it all into a soup pot and mix together once you're got everything prepared.
