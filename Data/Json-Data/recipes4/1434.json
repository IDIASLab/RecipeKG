Most everyone knows that the juiciest burgers come from ground beef that has a higher fat content. If you use lean beef, you're gonna get \"meatloaf\". 80% lean and 20% fat content is pretty much the standard. What percentage of fat do you use in your recipe? thanks, (they smell really good). I'm grilling them on a Foreman grill which are known for draining off the fat (and the moisture)from most meats.I'm waiting...waiting...\nI'm amazed,I watched the juices flowing out of the burgers and into the tray and thought \"here we go again...hot and  dry ground beef on a bun. For not the first time in my life, I was wrong.\nA very pleasant juicy burger. I wonder which ingredient or combination thereof keeps the juices in? A definite keeper, thank you.",

To get around this problem I use 1 to 1 1/2 slice of bread for every pound of meat and drizzle the bread with just enough milk to get it moist, I think its about 2 tbsp of milk.  The rest of the recipe I kept the same and the burgers turned out really moist and had good flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.",

When they're frozen solid, I toss 'em in a ziplog bag and keep them in the freezer for up to six months.  When I want a burger on a rainy day, a wintry day, or just one at a time, I mist a frying pan with cooking spray and cook about 7 minutes per side.
