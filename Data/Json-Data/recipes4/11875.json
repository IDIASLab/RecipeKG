I also blended up 2 cups of the soup about 15 minuets before it was done and added it to the soup while it finished cooking to make it thicker. Oh and I used 5 (instead of 3) tablespoons of flour to add to the thickness. It was thick and very flavorful thanks to all the bacon (and salt and pepper)! I also put Tabasco sauce in my individual serving YUM! Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
