Mushrooms are already loaded with water and this recipe only compounds the problem by calling for even more water and then to cover the pan!  I changed the cooking method altogether, simply sauteing everything in a large skillet in a combination of butter and olive oil and NO water. Rather than Italian seasoning I used a handful of chopped fresh herbs at the end.  This version was so much better; a solid 4 stars, and a unique change from the sauted mushrooms I generally serve with our grilled steaks.",

Here's what I did: I left out the green pepper and added a couple of green onions instead. I also left out the water at the suggestion of my fellow cooks and instead couldn't resist 2 small splashes of dry sherry instead. I didn't see that the recipe said seasoned salt until I actually looked closer so I had cracked some fresh salt on them first then did a quick sprinkle of seasoned salt still staying light on both so that guests could add their own. I took another cook's suggestion and tossed the mushrooms a few times. I also added some garlic and herb breadcrumbs during the last 10 minutes. Since I kept it covered the whole time the breadcrumbs were really soft when I pulled out the dish after 45 minutes so I stirred the whole thing together. It made a really nice sauce. The mushrooms smelled heavenly before they were cooked and even better after. I don't even like mushrooms but they were so easy and smelled so wonderful that I wouldn't hesitate to make them again. What an elegant dish!",
