This is supposed to be 4 servings but barely was enough for 3 servings. (2 adults and 1 child)  As the submitter suggests it is a good way to use up odds and ends in the refrigerator.  Peppers or green chilies would be an excellent addition.  Also, if you have leftover cooked potatoes you could certainly use those.  With a bit of tweaking this would make a fast weeknight dinner served with a large green salad to round out the meal.",

I did make some changes to the recipe:\n- After reading reviews I upped number of eggs from 3 to 4\n- I did not add the ham to the potatoes, garlic and onion during saute step.  I figured the ham was alredy cooked and this might overcook it.  Instead I coated with 1 TBSP mustard and combined with  veggies after they were done cooking.\n- I realized I do not have an oven-safe skillet, oops.  So after cooking veggies I transferred them to a Pyrex pan, added the ham and egg mixture, and cooked for a minute on the burner to slightly brown the eggs on the bottom.  Then transferred Pyrex to the oven to finish cooking.",
