First off I must say do not wait till after adding your onions, bell pepper, corn and tomatoes to drain off excess grease. One you lose too much of your veggies flavors and natural juices in doing so, for they get drained as well as the grease. Drain your ground beef after cooking it. \n\nAdding garlic is a must in my house, so I did. I can see where others say using 3 boxes of cornbread is way to much too. I made a homemade corn bread spread which would have been the equivalents of about 1 \u00bd box of store bought and it was just right. I also took the advice of others and I increased my barbeque sauce to 1 cup. I also did not pre-drain my tomatoes so it would have more moisture. I\u2019m glad I did not drain them either for it aided in making it moist and gave it more flavor. My husband loved it and is looking forward to leftovers tonight.",

To keep from being to dry I did not drain the tomatoes.

The smallest can of corn I could find was 8.5 oz, and I ended up using the whole thing, and used the whole can of diced tomatoes instead of half of it (and I think the results were very good). Ended up adding more bbq sauce like everyone else. Also, one box of cornbread was just enough, butI can't imagine using 3 on the full recipe; I think it would be way too much. Don't be scared of having the cornbread bake on top, only the bottom 1/4\" or so will absorb any liquid, and it's a good thing! That part tastes the best! I really liked how quick and easy this recipe was, and great \"bang for your buck\" in terms of flavor. The bbq and cornbread go together beautifully, not weird at all. would like to try a little cheese next time.",

I had a ton of it leftover so after a copule days I found this recipe. I re-heated the pork on the stovetop and added the vegetables and bbq sauce (reduced to 1/2 cup since I already cooked the meat in sauce). Then I took the advice of one reviewer and added a can of drained rinsed pinto beans. For the corn bread topping I used two 16 oz. packages of Marie Callenders mix (no trans fat just add water). I had a lot of meat and veggies and so the topping spilled over a bit but I really like it with a thick bread crust. It tastes delicious!",
