I made it as directed and my biggest complaint is that the pork chops were dry and rather tough; meanwhile the potatoes were not fully cooked at the end of the 40 minutes. In my older recipe the sauce is a bit thinner (no sour cream) and it is poured over both the chops and the potatoes. Each time I've made that the chops were moist and more tender than with this recipe. Given the undercooked potatoes I removed the chops and cooked the potatoes for 15 minutes longer at a higher temperature (425 degrees) -- and they were delicious and perfectly done. I would suggest parboiling the potatoes or microwaving them briefly before assembling the casserole and pouring the sauce over the chops and potatoes. It's an OK result as written but with a bit of tweaking the result could be quite good.",
