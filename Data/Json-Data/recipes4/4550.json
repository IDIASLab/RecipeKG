To save time the day of your BBQ make these ahead of time! Simply freeze the uncooked patties in a single layer on parchment paper on a cookie sheet then stack the frozen patties in a freezer container or Ziploc Freezer bag. Thaw the day before your party or cook the patties directly from the freezer (just add a few more minutes to the cooking time!). Delicious!",
