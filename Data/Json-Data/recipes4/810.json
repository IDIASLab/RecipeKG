Using the ladle helped to make the depth of each cut the same so it would hold it's shape. I soaked it in ice water for 1/2 hour sprinkled with seasonings and placed butter on top so it will melt down between the pedals. Spray the tin foil with cooking spray. This will definitely be on our grill in the future. Thank you J.D.!",
