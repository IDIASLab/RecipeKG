I goofed on the ingredients and used orange juice instead of concentrate so I also replaced the water with orange juice. We like things spicy so I add more chipotle peppers. The family won't eat the plums or the almonds so I just leave those out. I often leave this to marinate for 24 hours or more and sometimes add a bit of soy sauce to the leftover dressing and reduce it. Fantastic recipe I highly recommend this one.",

Thought the addition of some green onions and maybe diced tomato would help. We did enjoy the taste of the marinade and then the marinade turned dressing. The plums were very good on the grill and didn't get mushy in the six minute grill time. We used a gas grill rather than a charcoal grill. I served this over Napa cabbage as the recipe states but wonder if it would have been more pleasing to use the baby greens as submitter suggests as an alternative. We had 'Everything Bagel Cauliflower Rolls' from Pinterest with the salad.",
