I used butternut squash instead of sweet potato and heaping tsp. of hot paprika and doubled cumin and left out the coriander because I didn't have any on hand and used real Parmesan cheese instead of goat or feta. As another user recommended I browned the sausage with the onions and garlic before adding in the squash and I think that adds a bit to texture and taste. Because I subbed squash I increased the simmer time from 15 to 20 min.",

We\u2019ve always made with chick peas and spinach and love it that way. The feta is almost essential- the contrast between the sweet smoky stew and the sharp cheese is outstanding.
