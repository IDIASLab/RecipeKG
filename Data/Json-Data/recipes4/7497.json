However I am not sure if I did something incorrectly because the meat was very dry so the texture was not too pleasant. I served this with mashed sweet potatoes and broccoli. Taking a bite of the pork along with the sweet potato actually worked very well to add some needed moisture and the flavors complimented each other. If I make this again I might leave just a little bit of the fat and see if that helps keep some moisture in the meat.",
