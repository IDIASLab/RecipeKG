My family loved it very much. My issue was, I didn't like all the wetness of the gravy and cream corn (because it baked right over the edges of the pan and dripped everywhere in the oven). It made the mashed potatoes very wet and soupy-like (I don't like runny mashed potatoes) and the stuffing was lost underneath. I didn't realize until I tried spooning it out of the pan, that I myself, didn't like the goopy-ness. Again, this is me because my family had other opinions. The gravy needs to be left out and served with over the recipe after the dish is baked, that would appease my senses in enjoying this casserole. However, as is, I myself won't be eating it this way again. I apologize. My family on the other hand likes it as it is.",
