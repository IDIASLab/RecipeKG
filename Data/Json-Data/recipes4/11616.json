I thought that I had a sauce pre-made, only to find out that I was wrong.  Sheesh.... Anyway, I made this sauce, which looked strange to me, but, I was desperate.  Well, I ended up making mashed potatoes and having the meatballs with slices of cucumber instead.  A Swedish meat sauce should be brown like gravy, not creamy and definetly not like this one.  And just another comment, the IKEA sauce for the swedish meatballs is actually very close to the made from scratch sauce.",

Thankfully we all taste-tested it prior to adding the meatballs. I whipped up a white cream sauce as an emergency alternative since the other sauce was pretty much inedible. Ok on to the good part. The meatball recipe here is excellent I was very impressed with flavor and texture-they will be good with other sauces and I look forward to preparing them again. Hope others have better luck than I did with the sauce!",

I don't normally eat red meat merely because I don't really care for it however there's always an exception to every rule and this was it! I've spent many years looking for the perfect S.M. recipe and my search has finally ended. I did make a couple of changes to suit out tastes. To the meat mixture I added more seasonings; garlic and onion powders etc. After the meatballs were cooked in the oven I took them out of the casserole dish and placed them on a separate plate. I added beef broth (not water) to the casserole dish and cooked on a low flame in order to loosen the browned bits from the bottom. I then used that to make the sauce. No matter what any recipe calls for I always double the amount of liquid. In this case I added two cans of low salt cream of mushroom soup. Again Kari I'm totally impressed with your wonderful recipe and so were my hubby and kids. Thanks!",

I hate it when people review when they've made a lot of changes but I think the sauce recipe as written must be a mistake. I wouldn't want anyone to take the time to make this to be disappointed with the outcome. when just a few changes made a fabulous sauce. I did make the meatballs with ground turkey (since that was all I had) and they turned out quite well - other than that I made them as written. For the sauce I used butter instead of oil chicken stock instead of water (but use beef stock if you are using beef/pork for the meatballs) and just a bit of salt. I'm not afraid to use salt in my cooking but a whole tablespoon here has to be a mistake. The sauce turned out so good I made it again and served it with roasted chicken.",

I should have known when I was adding the amount of salt they told me to add a red flag went up and I thought... this is more salt than I have ever added to any recipe of this amount of meat and/or sauce ingredients. Don't ask me how I knew it was just WRONG. I have not re-tried this recipe without the salt but I'm suggesting that if you really want to use this recipe you may try using 1/4 the pepper 1/4 the salt in both the sauce and the meatballs and then MAYBE it will be okay.
