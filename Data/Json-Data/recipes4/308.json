Do be sure to note the fact that the kisses keep their shape when melted so don't wait for them to 'puddle' onto the pretzel.  When they are shiney take them out of the oven and press the M&M into the kiss to mold it to the pretzel.  I'm sure the round pretzel would be cuter, but the chocolate adhered fine to the square pretzels and tasted just as good!",

We tried several different flavors of Kisses and the ones that looked the best were the Peanut Butter Kiss and the Hugs. The only other suggestion I have is to use a wide straw to press the M&M into the Kiss. It keeps your fingers out of the chocolate and helps to give them all a neat and uniform look.",
