I was a little nervous when I first tasted the broth, about 30 min into the simmering. It was a tad bland. After reading a few reviews, I added a little garlic powder, onion powder and more salt (I used Low Sodium Beef Stock) and pepper and covered it back up and waited to taste it again after 1.5 hours. Perfect! All the flavors had had a chance to develop and it was delicious.  This will be on the menu this fall and winter. Thanks for sharing!",

Add remaining ingredients and ADD 1 CAN TOMATO SAUCE. Simmer for 2 hours.  The original recipe lacked presentation. It was something I would make for myself as a comfort food.

Definitely let the soup simmer for the full amount of time.  The flavors really come together then.  It does make a thicker soup, but we actually liked it better that way.
