But as I have traveled and worked and experienced foods from around the world, I look back and realize that many of the dishes she prepared, while simple, were perfect for that moment. Sometimes we have to put emotion and love in a dish to make it extra-special. The dish I am going to give you today is one like that. Simple and easy, yet full of love and goodness. My mother used to serve this with corn on the cob and cornbread. Very inexpensive and very good as well. Enjoy an Ozark memory...",

To our surprise, not only did HE like it, so did our very picky kids! I changed very little, which was to add Garlic to the cabbage mixture and used 2 cans of tomatoes as suggested by other users. I think if you were only to use a 1/2 head of cabbage, 1 can of tomatoes would be enough. Next time, I'm planning on making this w/ all the ingredients listed, garlic, 2 cans Italian diced tomatoes and 1/2 lb Italian Sausage. This is a super-easy, budget-friendly, hearty meal for your family and it tastes great to boot! Don't forget a pinch of red pepper flake & some TX toast on the side! Yum! Thanks for sharing!",

Instead of italian seasoning I substituted one tsp of cumin and 1 tsp paprika for that extra kick, and I added fresh tomatoes towards the last 10 minutes of cooking. Also added worcestershire sauce to the meat instead of salt.  Eating it right now on top of a bed of rice (sometimes I need my carbs). Thanks for the awesome idea!",

I absolutely hate cooking but this recipe is so simple. I just threw all of the ingredients in a large pot, stirred it a few times and that's it.  \n\n*I took someone else's suggestion and added a can of stewed tomatoes along with italian diced tomatoes. I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef and I added a touch of sugar and onion powder to add to the taste.",

I ran across this and had everything on hand in one form or another. I only had a half a head of cabbage but with the one can of diced tomato s it was just right. I cooked the ground beef separate because it was ground chuck 19/81 so a bit more grease than I like in food. I sauteed the onion and garlic and a bit of diced bacon in a bit of olive oil before I added the cabbage, then after the cabbage added the tomato and cooked beef. I used basil, oregano, parsley, red pepper and paprika to taste. Cooked it all down, then added some diced zucchini at the end because I had it and it needed to be used. Put it all over rice. My husband added grated Parmesan because he does that to anything remotely Italian. And he says it is a keeper and to put it into rotation. Yeah! Cheap, easy and quick. Thank you for posting this recipe.",

After reading some of the comments, I did add cumin, paprika, minced garlic and 2 cans of diced tomatoes. One can was Italian basil herb seasoned.  I did use the suggestion to put it over rice.  It was delicious!  I do think that next time I will try adding a can of tomatoe sauce to give it more thickness to the juice, but the basic recipe is something I had never tried and the flavors of the cabbage, onions and ground beef together and one pot cooking makes it a winner and a keeper in my recipe book.",
