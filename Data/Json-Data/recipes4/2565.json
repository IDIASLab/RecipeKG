I followed the recipe just as it was but added 1/2 cup of diced green peppers and a 4 oz drained can of mushrooms to the dish. I will say that the flavor of the dish was wonderful but the meat was tough. I had to remove the food from the oven transfer it into a pan and simmer it for another hour before I was satisfied with the tenderness of the meat. I highly recommend that this recipe be prepared in a crock pot. As a crock pot recipe the few ingredients that it calls for the ease of preparation the flavor of the sauce and the tenderness of the meat would have earned it a 5 star rating from me.",

I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of golden mushroom soup. I added a little milk to ease in stirring and added more pepper and garlic. I added half of a package of onion soup mix and sprinkled the chopped onion as well as some chopped fresh mushrooms over the beef before pouring the soup mix over it. I baked for 90 minutes and had to add more milk milk to keep it from becoming goopy. Next time I add about 1/2 can of milk right off the get go. My kids asked for thirds and LOVED it over mashed potatoes. This will definitely be a keeper in our house!",

I also added pepper and stirred in a little worchestershire sauce and sour cream before I served it. I cooked this in my crockpot all day the stew meat turned out tender and wonderful. I served it over rice for my boys and over potatoes for my husband and I. We all loved it. NOTE: This was extremely cost-effective for me to make. The stew meat I bought marked down and the remaining ingredients I bought cheaply at the Grocery Outlet for half what I would have spent at the corner store. Cooking it in my crockpot cut down on energy costs. Rice and potatoes are always cheap or on sale. All around I'm quite pleased with this meal.",

While the meat was frying I chopped 1 cup onion and 1 cup green pepper. After the meat was browned I removed them from the oil and sauted my onion and green pepper. Drain the oil off and add 3 cans cream of mushroom soup 1 package onion soup mix 1 4oz can drained mushrooms. I also added 3 Tablespoons of the sesame oil. It was kinda clumpy so I added milk until it was smooth and creamy. Then added the meat back in and simmered for 30 minutes to blend the flavors. It was wonderful. I am thinking to make this with chicken breast too. Thanks for the recipe. It is always fun to add your own ideas and be creative with someone elses recipe.",
