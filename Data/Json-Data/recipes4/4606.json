I would not recommend doing this. It became puree on the bottom of the mixer.\n I placed the mixture in a bowl then put it the buttermilk and oil mixing it with a fork as explained in the recipe. \nIt was easy to put together.\nI placed mine in the refrigerator, wrapped in saran wrap over night. It rolled out perfectly!  \n I pre baked my bottom shell. I made a Blackberry pie. Awesome out come.\n I based my top crust with the buttermilk instead of egg..\n It was light and flaky and got big smiles on the faces of the people I shared it with..\n I would recommend everyone try this recipe.  I give it 5 stars. Thank you for sharing.. And thank you all who sent in your reviews.. \nIt helped me make an informed choice, on a pie crust. I am no longer intimidated by making my own. No More store bought crust for me..\nI missed out on this for all these years.. Love it!",
