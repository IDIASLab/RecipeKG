                "reviewBody": "Scared of the very word \"ganache\"?  Well, you don't have to be with this recipe!  This is THE easiest ganache recipe I've ever used.  Since I was out of dark chocolate (which I highly recommend), I had to use semi-sweet chocolate chips--1 cup worth--and threw them into my food processor to save time and energy from chopping.  Once they were all chopped up and the whipping cream (didn't have heavy cream, either)was nice and bubbly, I turned the processor on and slowly poured in the whipping cream.  Stopped, scraped the sides, mixed it again, took the blade out (chunks of chocolate will stay on the blade, and you don't want the chunks of chocolate falling onto your cake when spreading the mix!), and put the mixture in the fridge for 15 minutes.  When the mix was a few notches looser than wiggly jello, I slowly poured the mix over my chocolate truffle cheesecake (which was cooled completely).  I had previously run a knife around the cheesecake and loosened the edges from the pan, then all but snapped the spring-form pan back into shape, leaving a slight space for the ganache to drip over the sides of the cake.  Let the cheesecake refridgerate overnight and you've got a big hit!  Note: after you've poured the ganache over the cake, use your finger to pop any air bubbles, so the finished product has a beautiful complextion.  Also, the better the quality of choclate, the better the ganache.  Don't go cheap on the choclate if you want a killer ganache!!",

Let the chocolate thicken a bit before pouring, place your cake on a rack over parchment paper for easy clean up, and take your cake off the rack and put on to your serving plate before the ganache has set- otherwise it can attach to the rack and tear when you lift it off. A wonderful recipe sure to win compliments from all!!!",

I used it in the place of regular icing for a chocolate layer cake.  First, I used 3 oz semisweet chocolate chips (that's all I could find) and 1/3 c. of cream with a little bit of Bacardi rum, and I put it in the freezer for a few minutes after mixing.  I used an electric mixer to beat it up into a fluffy icing for between my layers. It seemed like it would be too thin for it to work, but it got perfectly fluffy and light brown and gorgeous.  I then made another batch with the full portions but didn't beat it into fluffy icing, and used that for the top and the sides.  It turned out gorgeous and everyone loved it. I don't think I'll ever make plain icing again.",
