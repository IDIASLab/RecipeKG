Also I didn't have the sesame oil so I used Canola. Also my oranges were being sorta lame and didn't want to zest so I used what zest I could get and used some of the juice (maybe a few tablespoons) for good measure. One tip if you live near a Safeway or Vons grocery store their store brand Teriyaki (in the asian foods section - I think it is called safeway select) worked beautifully in this. And the bottle was only 1.79 for 10 ounces. Very affordable! Also I didn't have a grill so I just pan fried if you call it that with a bit of the marinade. Oh and I marinated it in a ziploc for about 3 hours. It was seriously fantastic!!",
