The Iraqi version uses lemon juice pomegranet molases and sugar with the water for cooking and flavoring these tastey lil things. Oh and a bit of EVOO drizzeled in with the water would glaze it extra beautifully! YUM! This recipe however is worth a try because any middle eastern version of Dolmas or Waraq inab is delicious really.",
