Or is it just called \"fudge\" because of the thin fudge like appearance when cut in squares? I assume it's an egg bake breakfast dish but I'm still not sure. It's super rich and the jalapenos add a nice bite. I served it with pancakes for breakfast and while it was ok I don't see it being a repeater at the LTH house. (I will try a completely cooled square later just in case that is how it was meant to be served and update the review if necessary). THANKS for the recipe!",

I live in AZ and it was green chile harvest at the time so I decided to replace the jalapenos with roasted green chiles the hot variety. DEE- licious! Next time I will make sure my jalapenos are hot and try it again. Overall I think it's a great low carb snack recipe. Extremely easy.",
