When I told Grumpy it called for olive oil he told me not to do it that you should always use butter when cooking venison. (Yeah he's my venison \"expert\" so I have to listen to him!)I sauteed the mushrooms(would have done the same if I had peppers). When they were cooked down I removed the mushrooms from the pan and sauteed the venison. I added the mushrooms back to the pan when the venison was cooked mixed in the soup mix with 3 cups of the water. I mixed the other 1/2 cup of water with 2 TBSP flour. I found this was not enough flour to thicken this to gravy so I added a little less than 2 TBSP more flour with just enough water to make it smooth. You should always mix the flour with the cold liquid you are going to add to the hot boilng liquid in your pan to prevent lumps. Thanks for the recipe! It is great for a night when you don't have a lot of time!",

He has been raving all night long about how good it was and when will I make this again. Thanks so much for the keeper. PS. I have some venison that we canned I think I may try it with that.

I cut steak into 1/2 inch cubes cooked with one med red onion and one white onion chopped and cooked in 1 stick butter with 3 med/lg fresh garlic cloves. added 1 red and 1 yellow pepper roughly chopped and rough chopped thick mushrooms when meat was half done.. covered/simmered low about 10min (stirring a time or two). uncover and added cream of potato soup cheddar soup and one can of milk. the only seasoning I aded was about a tsp of fresh cracked pepper. I didn't need the flour since I used canned cream soup. it turned out nice and creamy and not gamey (cut into small pieces for the 'flavors' to go all the way through) We liked this the best of the venison recipes!

To make the gravy which there is alot of just mix water and flour together til smooth and add to hot/boiling liquid. Great over mashed potatoes or egg noodles (my son hates mashed potatoes.)
