I added 1/2 cup of the puree to the cake batter and ONLY 2 TBSP of the puree to the icing, which comes out to a PERFECT spreading consistency.  I made this in a 9x13 baking dish and the icing was the perfect amount to cover the top nicely.  This is an absolutely great recipe, with the above modifications!",

I've made it twice now--once for an informal wedding shower and once for family, and everyone raved about it both times.  Based on others suggestions, I modified the recipe.  I pureed the package of strawberries, and for the cake I made for my family, I put the puree through a mesh strainer to remove the seeds for my picky husband.  After tasting the cake with and without seeds, without is really better and worth the effort.  I baked the cake in a 13x9 pan for 35 minutes and it came out perfect. I determined that due to the \"runny\" nature of the icing, a 3-layer cake might be tricky.  The icing was a little sweet for my taste, so I put in 8oz. of cream cheese, and 1 tsp. mexican vanilla to tone down the sweet and enhance the flavor.  However, to thicken it up a bit, I did end up adding another cup of powdered sugar.  Also, I only used 1/3c. of the strawberry puree in the icing, and put the other 2/3c. in the cake batter.  Because of the fruit, cream cheese, and butter in this cake, I store it in the refrigerator.  It stays nice and moist for as many days as you can keep it around--which isn't long at my house.  This recipe is a keeper!",

It was horrible and required a lot of modifications (should have listened to the other reviewers). This time I used the cream cheese icing from this site and it worked perfectly. I made three 9\" layers; pureed the strawberries and strained it to remove the seeds and added it to the batter. I added a bit of the puree to a small portion of the cream cheese icing to test but decided I preferred the icing without it. I added sliced strawberries with the icing in between the layers and I garnished with chocolate covered whole strawberries. Stunning presentation and amazing taste to boot. This recipe is a keeper!",

Of course layered cakes are much more elegant looking than others but with this particular recipe I prefer it in a rectangular pan. We've prepared this cake several times and have always used frozen strawberries. And everyone who tries this really enjoyes it. I'm a die-hard chocolate lover but actually prefer this cake!!

Also given the reviews about the frosting being a \"sloppy mess \" I took other reviewers' suggestions and used \"Cool Whipped Frosting \" substituting strawberry extract for the vanilla and adding 1/3 cup of strawberry puree. I made this in two layers and put a layer of fresh sliced strawberries over the filling in between the layers. I decorated it with just a few fresh strawberries with the stems. I could see this \"pretty in pink\" cake as a real crowd pleaser for a little girl's birthday party and wish I had come across this when my daughter was younger. All around not much payoff or reward for the effort. To me it just screams \"fake.\"",

I made the frosting like the reviewer Diana suggested \"My frosting is 1 stick of butter with 4 cups of powdered sugar with a little vanilla.\" My mom's hints to help cut the sweetness is to add a tad bit of salt or lemon juice. I ended up using about a tablespoon of concentrated lemon juice to the frosting and it turned out GREAT! Since I used fresh strawberries the cake was perfect and the icing was sweetened to my taste. The frosting made too much since I used a 9x13 pan but would be plenty for a multi-layer cake. Perfection!",

For filling I used the filling from the Strawberry and Cream Cake on this page (1 1/2 cups heavy cream, 2 T sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1 1/2 cup sliced strawberries) and used homemade cream cheese frosting to frost the top.
