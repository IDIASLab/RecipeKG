Add 2 cans regular mushroom soup, the chive & onion cream cheese (if you have only regular cream cheese use that) a few TB sour cream, heat through, add wine but it's better with about 1/3 cup sherry. Serve with cut-up fresh chives& parsley. Great with mashed potatoes or served on heated pastry shells.We like a lot of sauce, so you can play around by adding or deleting.  Only takes about 20 min from start to finish and it's unbelievably great.",

I made it with 98% fat free condensed mushroom soup and 1/3 less fat chive and onion cream cheese, plus changed the butter to use a lower fat spreadable butter made with olive oil.  The only cooking wine I had was a dry white with lemon, so I used that.  I don't like reviews that say they changed every ingredient in the recipe and that made it 5 stars, so while I did make some changes, I tried to stick to as true to the recipe as possible, just using lower fat ingredients.  I will definitely make this again.  To add a vegetable to the dish, I added a 16oz bag of frozen broccoli after the dish had cooked for 3 hours.  We served it over pasta, and my boyfriend went back for seconds (he doesn't usually eat much!).",
