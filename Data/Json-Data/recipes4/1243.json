To reconstitute dried herbs put the desired amount in a small, very small container with a few drops of water. It should be barely enough to cover the herbs. Heat in the microwave for a few seconds, 10-20 maybe.Use the water in the recipe. It's a small amount but it will add flavor. That's it.",

I coated my pork with a smidge of olive oil before rubbing with spices,let the meat stand on the counter to bring down to room temperture before cooking, and cooked in the rotisserie. It made a superb crunchy crust and just bursting with juices inside.I think it is very important to have a meat thermometer handy, as pork is horrible when too dry no matter what it is rubbed with! We cook ours until the internal temp. reaches about 150, take it out, let it sit, and the temp. rises a bit more, but not enough to dry it out.",

I did modify this, based on my own experience making and eating it.  Make little slits in the roast and insert slivers of garlic (rather than using garlic salt). Salt and pepper the roast and rub it with olive oil, then pat it with a mixture of fresh chopped rosemary and thyme (or just rosemary).  While the roast is resting after cooking, deglaze the roasting pan with white wine and allow to reduce to a savory white wine reduction.  If you prefer gravy, as Hubs did tonight, deglaze the pan with white wine or broth, then thicken with a slurry of cornstarch or flour, and broth.  I like to start this out at 450 degrees fotr 10-15 minutes, then continue the cooking at the reduced temp of 350.",

Threw in about a pound of baby carrots, which turned out wonderful.  Cooked for about 8 hours.  It was so moist and tender, we loved it!  Served with Creamy Au Gratin potatoes from this site.
