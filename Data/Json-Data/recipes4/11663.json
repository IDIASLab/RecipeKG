Saw this recipe and thought that it was quick and easy - so I decided to use it. Mind you I have only had pumpkin soup once and it was from some gourmet recipe that required fresh pumpkin and a long list of ingredients. This simple recipe was much better than that one. I made it exactly as called for and found that it was a wee bit bland although I could definitely taste the pumkin and only used enough water to get it to the right consistancy. So as several reviewers suggested I spiced it up. I added onion 1 tsp onion powder 1 Tbs. sugar 1 Tbs. curry powder - and 2 tsp of a Morrocan spice blend (cumin paprika cinnamon corriander ginger) I had left over from another recipe. YUM! This was total perfection! Now we like things savory so that you may want to adjust the amounts but this is delicious and definitely a keeper. My cream of potato soup (Campbells) had chunks of potatoes so I purred it with a stick blender before serving. Thanks Katherine for the wonderfully easy recipe. There is a bit left over - and it is MINE.",
