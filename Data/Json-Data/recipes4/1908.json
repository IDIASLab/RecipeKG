As always-marinate chicken in buttermilk for a few hours before preparing(1cup milk 1tbs white vinegar or lemon juice if no buttermilk on hand)-makes the chicken sooo moist.I cooked bacon half way in skillet and removed.  Then I added the spinach and garlic to the same skillet and cooked down(thanks to a tip from another reviewer). When done I squeezed in paper towels to take out some of the grease.  Then I mixed with sour cream, a combo of mont jack and sharp cheddar cheese, pepper, salt, a little each of curry powder, red pepper flakes and hung paprika for a little xtra zip and rolled into chicken and cooked as directed with the bacon on top.  Worth making.  No leftovers-unfortunately!",

                "reviewBody": "Awesomeeeeeeeeeeee dish. Looked like it was from a Gourmet Magazine. We did marinate the chicken in a buttermilk marinade, as a previous user suggested. The bacon turned out great, and we added tons of cheese. Mozzerella, Parm, Feta, etc. We just cooked the spinach as directed on the label, not with the microwave as the recipe suggests. We also actually ended up with a lot of the spinach/cheese-stuffing left over. Oh well. We probably measured something wrong.\n\nOne suggestion: There was a ton of bacon grease that was sort of oozing out onto the baking dish when it was in the oven. Most of it got burned onto the baking dish. I'd suggest putting the chicken breasts on aluminum foil and then put that on a baking dish, just to minimize the scrubbing of the burnt bacon grease off the baking dish. \n\nVery good chicken though. We used a lot of toothpicks, but we probably didn't need to. Make sure you pound the breasts to 1/2 inch so it's easy to roll up too. Bottomline: Tasty, tasty dish. Try it. 5 stars.",

I precooked the bacon for about 4-5 minutes in the microwave and then placed two strips in an \"X\" over the top of the stuffed breast and tucked the ends underneath - no need for toothpicks.  With 3-4 minutes under a broiler to finish off the bacon and a light sprinkling of more shredded cheese over the top, these were fantastic!  Simple enough to make for the family, elegant enough to serve to company.  Wow!",

I cooked it at 350 for about 25 mins and then finished it off by broiling it for about 5 mins to really crisp up the baccon. Very tasty! The baccon made the chicken SOOOO juicy.
