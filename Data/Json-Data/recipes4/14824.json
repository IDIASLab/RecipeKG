My girlfriend and I experimented to come up with this version. Feel free to make alterations to suit your own taste! Many ingredients (Thai basil, fish sauce, palm sugar, etc.) may be difficult to find in a regular supermarket, but you can most likely find them in an Asian market.",

I added some broccoli and mushrooms and only 1/2 package of dried wide rice noodles.  If you are not used to using dried noodles, the best thing to do with these rice noodles is to pour boiling water over them and let them sit 3-8 minutes until tender.  Then, drain and let them sit in cold water until you are ready to add them to the pan.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.  I was craving Thai food and was extremely happy to create something so authentic in my own home--for a LOT less money.  I highly recommend using Thai basil in this recipe--it has amazing flavor!",

I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have quite enough Thai basil and substituted 1 cup regular basil. It was just the right level of spiciness for me. I usually order medium at Thai restaurants. Also - brand/style of fish sauce can make a huge difference. I tried Phad Thai with some milky looking fish sauce - it was disgusting. Squid brand fish sauce is what a Thai friend recommended. It's a clear brown that is much milder and not scary at all.",
