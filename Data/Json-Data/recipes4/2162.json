I am not sure what 2 1/2 cups of heavy cream was for when I used less than 1 c. Also tenderloin is to pricey to ever serve medium well. I pulled from the over after 30mns and it was already medium well so if you make this recipe make sure to check the temp. after 20mns. This recipe is a good concept I will make many modifications next time I try it. (Can you tell I'm still upset after over-cooking the tenderloin?!)",
