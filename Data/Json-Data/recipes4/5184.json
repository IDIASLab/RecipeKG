The horseradish gives the spread that interesting bite. You'll have people begging you for the recipe and you won't be able to stop eating it! You can start with less horseradish and increase to your taste. Serve with crackers, pita or bagel chips, or pretzels. Even great with celery sticks! Store leftovers in refrigerator in airtight container.",

Gordon Food Service used to have their version called 'Tavern Cheese Spread' in their retail stores here in Florida. I'd buy it a case at a time but when I went back to resupply they discontinued it.. OH NOOOOO!!! I gotta have my fix especially with upcoming football parties.
