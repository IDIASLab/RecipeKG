I bought pizza dough from my local pizza parlor and it was enough to make a large pizza. (Most independent pizza places will sell you pizza dough. I pay a little over two dollars for a large ball of fresh dough.) I did one half exactly as the recipe stated and I did one half with the same toppings but layered ricotta and fresh garlic on the crust before adding the toppings to bake so it was like a \"white pizza\" with the butternut squash and onion. The recipe as written was very good but I think I preferred the side that I had added ricotta. I do think with the sweetness you get from the butternut squash something fresh sprinkled on top before eating it like arugula or cilantro would have been wonderful.",
