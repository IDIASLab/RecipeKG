After slicing the peppers and cleaning them out, drop in boiling water for 4 - 6 minutes. This will pretty much take all the heat out though so if you want a punch, leave the membranes. We taste tested several cream cheese flavors. We picked 3 fav's, they were the cream cheese mixed with a powdered ranch mix, or mixed with a chipotle seasoning, or mixed with worstershire and garlic powder.  (we tried 12 different flavors to get this perfect) Also, I found that 1/2 a strip of bacon was not enough - used the whole thing!  And finally after you put the pepper together with cheese and bacon and toothpick - freeze it for 15 min. Then 10 minutes on the grill is perfect. Thanks so much for the yummy appetizer!!",

After making these many times, I can tell you that you really need to make them ahead of time and put them in the refrigerator for a couple of hours or the freezer for about 15 minutes.  This will allow the cheese to firm up a bit and it won't all leak out of your peppers.  I also have found that if you want them hot, leave all of the membrane inside and some seeds.  If you want them barely warm(like me), get almost all of the membrane out from inside the pepper and leave no seeds.  I cook them in the oven on 350 for about 45 minutes. \n***A low calorie version is use fat free cream cheese and wrap each 1/2 pepper with only 1/2 slice of bacon.  They are just as good and only about 60 calories each!!!\nYUM YUM!!!",
