I layered it wrong--stuffing first, turkey with sauce and then the potatoes with cheese sprinkled on top.  It was divine!  I read the review on the blandness, so before I added the flour I added 1/4 chopped onion, 2 cloves chopped garlic, and a chopped celery stalk. THEN added 2 more tablespoons of butter and the flour.  It was SOO good!  I will make this again!  Thanks!",

Perhaps a little on the bland side for our personal taste but a teaspoon of sage 1/2t thyme and a little crushed rosemary took care of that. We had a large turkey breast in our freezer that I wanted to use up and this was a perfect way to do it. I tripled the turkey and used a full box of stove top stuffing on top. Yum! Thanks Sharon.",

Although I don't like to stray from following a recipe before I try it I did (a little). I followed the recipe accordingly but I also added a 15 oz. can of mixed vegetables over the turkey and instead of the stuffing mix (I didn't have any) I crumbled up about 10 \"buttery\" crackers (Sociables) over the mashed potatoes then drizzled the melted butter over that. This was heavenly. My kids aren't big turkey eaters but they (as well as myself and husband) had seconds and thirds on this. This is definately a keeper.",

I just used a smaller dish (8x11) more turkey (about 2cups) and cheese (we like it cheesy) and I also added some herbs and more pepper to the whole thing. I also didn't have stuffing mix so I too used crackers with a little butter on top and it was absolutely perfect! I must admit the two of us polished off the whole casserole not one crumb left.
