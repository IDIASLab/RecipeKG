I decided to try making these as a grab-and-go breakfast as I am working on being healthier, but had to force myself to eat them throughout the week (I felt bad just throwing them away and wasting all the ingredients after spending so much time grating them). For anyone interested in trying this recipe, perhaps try making a half recipe first to see if you like the taste. I mean no offense to the recipe writer, but wanted to write a review to caution others about making such a huge portion as they may not be everybody's cup of tea.",

I agree with PETERS., it did need cinnamon, which I sprinkled on top. I love this recipe because you can get creative with it. Next time I'll add raisins, Craisins, and will mix the cinnamon inside. Also, I chopped the apples finely instead of grating them; they weren't noticeable. Love this!!",

I followed the recipe aside from one thing: I replaced the chopped nuts with a half cup of creamy peanut butter, because I can\u2019t eat pieces of nuts (dietary restrictions). I also drizzled them with a mixture of melted peanut butter and coconut oil when they cooled down a bit. I love addition of carrot and apple. The fruits and veggies stay slightly firm and give these bars tons of texture when mixed with rolled oats. I think replacing the chopped nuts with creamy peanut butter may have given these bars a slightly different texture. Mine were moist and almost brownie like. Lastly, my daughter and husband love them too! They\u2019re a winner. I\u2019ll definitely be making them again.",
