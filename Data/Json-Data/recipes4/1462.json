I used wheat germ instead of wheat bran. And I used egg replacer instead of an egg. They are excellent quite soft and just the right amount of sweet. Actually the next time I make them I think I'll leave out the brown sugar because I think they would be sweet enough without it. I would love to try them with some dried cherries and golden raisins too!",

If I make them again I'll decrease the bran to 1/4 cup and increase the ww flour to 1 1/4 cup. May cut back on the milk powder as well. Think it needs a little more Peanut Butter and maybe some spice like cinnamon or nutmeg. I may add a little brown sugar as some of the other reviewers suggested.",
