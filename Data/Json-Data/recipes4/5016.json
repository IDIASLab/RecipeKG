Instead of dipping the 'shrooms in oil I sprayed them with oil and it worked out great! The Parmesan didn't stick too well when sprinkled on at the end so I gently pressed it in. Made waaaay more filling than needed but the recipe didn't specify which type of mushrooms to use and I had used baby bellas. Will try again for sure!",
