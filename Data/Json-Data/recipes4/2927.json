Stuff with your choice crunchy peanut butter, jam, bananas, or other fruit for dessert egg rolls.  For Italian, use \"Italian\" components; Mexican, same.  By using this method your egg rolls will not come out soggy and oily.  Great recipe for kids & parties.  Must eat immediately, will not hold!",
