Also added chopped cooked country sausage links. Yummy! Even the other campers came by to see what smelled so good. Had to sit down and write out recipe five times!!!! This is a definite keeper.",

It took me fifteen minutes to get on this site yesterday as our computer is having major issues. (we just ordered a new one) Once I finally got to this recipe I read it once and got bumped off again. I decided to wing it anyway. Well I'm certainly glad I did because this was really delicious! To save on time I placed my whole potatoes in the microwave and then fried them with the onion in the skillet. I also used breakfast sausage patties which I cut into small pieces instead of ham. The kids loved the puffed pastry part of this meal. I'll definitely be making this again Michele!",

                "reviewBody": "I prepared this for my son's birthday breakfast before a day of 4-wheeling. Wish I had read the reviews ahead. Recipe sounded wonderful and it looked beautiful but very bland. Living in a casino town I have many weekend guests and love good brunch ideas. Maybe some roasted green chiles or Bird's Eye southwestern veggies.",
