Follow the recipe for a richer tasting dish and it receives a 5 rating. The one w/ balsamic vinegar gets 4. I experimented w/ Tiger Sauce on a portion and next go round may add that in the cored out center w/ a pat of butter. If you like caramelized onions give this a try!",

After reading the reviews (just before writing this) and knowing what I do about how it was cooked- I think it never caramelized or at least it didn't fully. Our grill was on the fritz & wouldn't get nice and flamey. I may try again some time when I have high heat:) and a few more people to test it on.",
