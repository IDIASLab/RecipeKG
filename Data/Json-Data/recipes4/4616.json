I make it with a turkey breast, and after it's done I shred all the meat off the bones and place it in a bowl with all of the juice.  We serve it over rice (long grain & wild rice, usually).  The next day I usually skip the rice and heat up a bowl of the juicy turkey meat all by itself.  The flavor is terrific.",

Only change was I had crock pot on high for the 1st hour, then turned to low for the rest of the time.  Very tender with a nice, not overpowering flavor (just right). Served with mashed potatoes & roasted carrots.  Everyone (including 2 teens) was happy. Will make this many more times, thanks for the recipe!",

Put one chopped onion and one chopped celery stalk around the breast with the cranberry sauce and juice and you're good to go.  We LOVE turkey cooked in the crock pot!",
