I only had 1 1/4 cups red lentils and I ended up using 1/4 cup regular lentils (as you can see in the picture I am submitting, the color of the soup was not uniform, but that was unimportant).  I did add salt to the water when cooking the lentils and ended up adding probably close to 1 more cup of water.  I used the suggested coconut milk and used Jamaican Curry Powder along with (as suggested) red pepper flakes, cumin, and cinnamon.  I then prepared some Jasmine rice and steamed some broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots as that is what I had in the freezer.  I spooned some veggies and some rice in a bowl and ladled the soup over top.  This makes a lot of soup and I thought for sure we would have substantial leftovers, but my son ate 4 huge servings and he is only 12 years old!  It was delicious and I could easily make it again and have it tonight.  Be warned, however, that meat eaters may not find it substantial enough to their liking.  I am a vegetarian and my husband is not and although he ate it, I do not think he will request it again any time soon.  That's ok because there will be more for my son and I! Thanks for a great recipe!",
