Another suggestion would be to soak the lentils overnight to speed up the cooking process. I added a bay leaf and substituted the can of diced tomatoes for a can of mild Rotel tomatoes with green chilies to kick it up a notch. I also changed the meat to pickled pork (or you could use cubed ham or diced salt pork) which you can just put right into the slow cooker and skip the first step. I used all broth rather than water for added flavor and I happened to have that much broth on hand. I also put the cabbage into the slow cooker right from the beginning or you can omit it altogether. With my changes I'd give it a 5 but as is it's only a 3 at best. Sorry.",
