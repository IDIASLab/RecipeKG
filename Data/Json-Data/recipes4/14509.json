I also used half & half rather than heavy cream because it's what I had on hand. \nThis makes A LOT of dumplings, which is fine by me, but it should be noted that this would serve more than 6 people; perhaps ten  The flavor was very good and I'm happy there were no added oils.",

I didn't have any sage so I used poultry seasoning instead and I used carrots in place of the celery. I added a drained can of corn with the chicken and parsley and I felt it added a lot. I tasted the broth after it was almost done and I felt like it was a little bland and needed more salt so I used some chicken bouillon to add more chicken flavor. We really enjoyed this but I felt the smaller dumplings were better than the large ones. They soaked up more flavor. Next time i will make them all smaller maybe 1 inch instead of 1 1/2.",

I had some roast chicken left over after I made a quite sizable bowl of chicken salad along with the carcass. So I got chicken broth and set the chicken parts and bits to simmer. I added onion celery and a small can of drained corn after fishing the chicken out of the broth along with the recipe spices and a few extras. While that simmered I made the dumplings with canned biscuits that I rolled out thin cut into squares and threw in the pot when the veggies were soft in small batches. What I've learned about dumplings is that you NEVER put the top on at least while they're forming. My dumplings turned out great altho I don't think I put enough of them in the broth so that will be for next time. Except that it was peppery my favorite spice these chicken & dumplings came out better than I thought the would.",

I did not adjust the seasonings but did add 1c chopped carrots in addition to the celery. Quite good.
