The result is a rich and flavorful shrimp and grits recipe that will have you saying 'Yum!' I know you want to add a ton of cheese and butter, but you have to trust me that you won't need it!

It really didn't seem to be part of the recipe just more of a side. I would reduce the butter next time and would probably use a smoked bacon instead of the maple cured. It was a little sweet. Also the only real purpose of the bacon was the grease to fry the shrimp although I wouldn't chnage that. You could use the bacon for something else. This was a HUGE hit.",
