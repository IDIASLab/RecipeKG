I always try to make a recipe exactly as stated first so I can fairly judge it.  I tried this with out added bluecheese.  It is\r\nmild and delicious.  Even my non bluecheese eaters loved the gravy.  For those of us who like a bit more bluecheese I added more and it also was excellent.  I love gravies made with whipping cream.  I however can not afford the calories on a regular basis as they tend to go to my hips.\r\nThe next time I make this I will make\r\nthe gravie with nonfat half-n-half, nonfat canned milk, or nonfat milk.  When I use nonfat milk in place of whipping cream or half-n-half I add 1\r\ntablespoon of cornstarch for thickening per cup of liqued.  I will\r\nalso use olive-oil in place of butter.\r\nI like some of the other reviewers sauteed mushrooms and served them on the side.  I will be making this again soon with a nice cut of steak.  I know it will be a hit too!  Thanxs Toni for an excellent recipe.  It is a keeper for sure and I will use it again and again.  This recipe is well worth trying!",
