Who would have thought this was decent. A BIG...HUGE... thing that I'd change for next time was cooking the hotdogs PRIOR to putting it in the oven.  ...unless of course you like that straight out of the fridge taste, which most people don't.  I put it in for the set amount of time and even cooked HALF the amount, and the hot dogs were still not cooked.  We had to put them in the microwave.  There's always using your favorite sausage link or my favorite andouille sausage instead.  Also, even after halving the recipe, we thought it needed more chili.  We've used homemade chili too.  Don't be afraid to add that cheese too and being creative and adding things like onions, etc.  It won't be gooey (a worry I had).  We also put the tortillas on the stove to cook them a little before baking.  Will do it again with these corrections.",

Too much fat in original recipe so I used 99% fat free Vegetarian chili 2% Sharp Cheddar cheese and fat free white smoked Turkey hot dogs. Then per other suggestions put diced onions inside flour tortillas with the dog. This all added up to a tasty dinner the roommate said would be worthy of having again. After decreasing the fat by a ton the only drawback is the enormous sodium content of the chili.",

I cook my hot dogs first, go with 1 can of bean and 1 can of no-bean chili, which I combine and warm, add about a quarter cup of ketchup to the mix to make the chili go a litte further and put some cheese and a tad of the chili inside of each tortilla.

Psst - dad and kids try to beat each other out for the leftovers - yea it's that good. Just add a little more chili - not too much. Use the 19 oz cans instead. Perfect amount. If you want it healthier as some suggested make your own chili and you can also use all natural turkey hot dogs like I do. By using a good quality canned chili it's a dinner that can be on the table in 30 mins with little effort. My favorite part.",
