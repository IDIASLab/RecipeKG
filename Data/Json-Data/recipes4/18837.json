The recipe has an odd way of cooking the rice and then rinsing it then heating it in the wok which we felt was unnecessary (but we followed the recipe). As for the pork belly the sauce has a nice flavor but it too had a watered down flavor and slumpy texture.",

I\u2019d use next time instead. The pork belly was pretty good, however I would definitely add more garlic and ginger. It would be nice if it \u201ccarmelized some\u201d, may try to sear if after cooking to lock in some of that sauce flavor. Might be good to strain some of the \u201cpork grease\u201d from the cooking liquid and make more of a sauce from it.",
