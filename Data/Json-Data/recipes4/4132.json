One of my most favorite breakfasts since then and my kids especially go nuts over this. My husband likes his with leftover meat lovers, my kids like theirs with leftover pepperoni but me? I like it with leftover veggie pizza. I don't add italian seasoning to mine but it's all a matter of taste and what you prefer. Really yummy treat for the morning. NOTE: I do not take the toppings off my pizza. I just cut up the whole piece and warm it in the pan with a little butter before adding the eggs. If you do this, you might find that one piece will be plenty.",

This was so good and what a great way to use up leftover pizza - besides the obvious of just eating cold or reheating it and eating it. I omitted the oil as I never cook my eggs in oil, but other than that I didn't change a thing. We had leftover sausage and pepperoni pizza and boy was this an unexpected treat. You could easily but this inside a tortilla for a really awesome breakfast wrap! This recipe is a definite keeper!",
