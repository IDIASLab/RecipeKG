My husband loved this so much that after he finished his plate he walked over to the pan where a extra piece was and started eating it right out of the pan... classy, eh? He said it tasted like something from a 5 star restaurant and I thought so too.  The best thing about it is that is is super easy to make if you have cornbread on hand.  I would suggest making sweet cornbread the previous day for another dish and using the leftovers for this receipe the next day.  The only variance I made was that I tripled the garlic and cut up a whole green pepper instead of half.  I also put salt and pepper on the chicken and didn't add the sauce until 10 minutes before it was ready.  So yummy... my 9 year old loved it too!",

I also poured Knorr gravy mix over the top instead of cream of chicken soup as I don't like the flavor of the soup; next time I'll make a double batch of gravy as it could have used more. Husband and I loved the flavor of the cornbread though I substituted poultry seasoning for sage because I realized I was out of sage while cooking. Will definitely make again!",

The meal smelled so good while it was cooking and then when I opened the oven door...wow! I could not believe that I really honestly loved this recipe! Our 11 year old picky eater even snarfed down his chicken. It was so incredibly easy and delicious I am sending it to our 20 year old son....he can even do this.
