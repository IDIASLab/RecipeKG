Best part is that it gets better with age, so make plenty and enjoy throughout the week!

I also add two cans of beef consomme and 2 Tbsp Worchester Sauce, both of which give the broth some extra ooomph! Throw everything EXCEPT the barley, into a crockpot for about 6 hrs. Add the barley about 1hr before serving. Easy! \n\nA note to new cooks: Taking the time to brown the meat & veg in a skillet is the key to developing flavour base for most every soup or stew. It takes a few more minutes & dirties another dish BUT your taste buds will thank you!",

I cooked mine for 11/2 hrs. at a simmer and all my veggies and barley were cooked I only cooked the mushrooms for 30 mins. before serving. I also had to add more liquid (31/2 cups of water) This is a delicious soup and does get better the next day. I'll definetly make this again.",
