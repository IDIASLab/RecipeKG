However following other reviews I used a chocolate cake with hot fudge ice cream topping (Hershey's)instead of chocolate syrup and this was much better. The guys I made it for (using chocolate cake and fudge) loved it. If you want to make the \"Baptist\" version use Peppermint extract instead. BTW for those worried about the alcohol it dissipates with heating leaving only the flavor and you can always use peppermint extract for the topping if you are worried about children.",

The only alterations I used were that I used chocolate cake mix and I used hot fudge instead of chocolate syrup.  After I \"frosted\" the cake w/ the whipped topping, I made some designs on the top with chocolate syrup and then put broken pieces of Andes Candies on top.  It looked great.  Everyone loved it.

You may also use 1.5 box of cake mix as the cake mix today has less in it than 30-40 years ago when my grandmother used to make this. We also top ours with a thin layer of melted chocolate instead of syrup - it hardens and adds a kind of crunch texture that goes great with the creamy whipped cream & cake. Just be sure not to spread it on too thick or you can't cut through it!",
