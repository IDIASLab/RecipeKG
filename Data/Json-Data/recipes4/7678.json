Peeled them and grated them with the food processor grating blade and them into a salad spinner full of cold water.  I also grated 1/2 a white onion and added that.  Let the potatoes soak while the sausage was cooking.  Drain the potatoes and spin them dry.  Mixed it up along with the grated onion and it was ready to go into the oven in about 10 minutes.  I used an 8 x 8\" casserole dish and it was just the perfect size.  It baked in exactly 45 minutes is a well pre-heated oven.  Next time I would add some cheese to the top in the last 10 minutes of baking and garnish with green onion to spruce it up a bit.  It made 4 very generous servings.  Note:  Diced Green chilies would be excellent in this.",

                "reviewBody": "Loved this basic recipe, but when trying to make this the first time, I also found that the recommended pan was too small and that there wasn't enough liquid, so I had to follow other reviewers' advice.  I had to use a larger 11x16 baking dish to fit the potatoes. I also used 2 cups of shredded cheese and 8 eggs with 1.5 cups of milk whisked in.  I folded the cheese and sausage into the egg mixture and then stirred  the egg mixture into the potatoes.  I baked it a little longer and it came out great!  I have also made it using chopped broccoli and diced cooked ham.  Next time I may even try to make it healthier with venison sausage, and shred my own organic potatoes.  I'm SO glad to have a delicious and versatile breakfast casserole recipe that isn't full of bread!  --Updated 4/21/2016:  Thank you, 80percentgray, for correcting the amount of potatoes in your yummy recipe above.  We love it!  I recently made it for dinner using my own shredded organic potatoes, venison sausage, organic spinach, mushrooms, minced garlic, Daiya vegan cheese, and reducing the (almond) milk by 1/4 cup.  Delicious!",

For me it fit more appropriately in a three-quarters casserole dish and I used 20 ozs of the \"Simply Potatoes\" fresh hash browns from the refrigerated meat section and squeezed the moisture out of them between paper towels. Like some others I found that in 45 minutes baking time the egg & milk mixture was still too wet. Flavor would not have been as good had I not chosen to add a half-cup of scallions. I did add a little extra grated cheese on top as others have suggested. The foodie guests whom I served this to and I agreed it would be even better with some chopped fresh mushrooms and some diced fresh green or red pepper or a small can of green chilis.",

I can't imagine if I would've added 1.5 teaspoons?!?!  I also used 8 eggs and eyed the milk to make it what looked like the right consistency, maybe a 1/2 cup.  I added 1/4 cup red onion, red & green pepper to the sausage as well. Realized I forgot the mushrooms I wanted to add as well until after I had everything in the 9 x 13 dish and so topped it with those.  Put it in the fridge overnight so that Christmas morning I could just pop it in the oven.    Baked 45 minutes then added a little cheddar cheese to the top and put back in oven to melt it.  It was delicious!  I got up early to put this in the oven so that my 22 year old son could eat a nice warm breakfast before having to work Christmas morning....  I had to beg the little stinker to eat it because he isn't \"much of an egg person\".  Who know since not too long ago (like a year!)  he was making egg scrambles nearly every morning.  He had seconds and took some with him to have for lunch!  I would rate it 5 stars with the changes I made per others suggestions!  This will be my go to breakfast for holidays and is easy enough it may be a go to breakfast during the school year as well!  Enjoy!",
