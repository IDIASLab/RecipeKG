It's great as a main dish but could be a side as well. This is the first of many wonderful lentil recipes i tried. I was scared of lentils but my daughter wouldn't eat meat so i had to try other things...needless to say lentils are a part of our regular diet and that is because of this great recipe.",

But when the product was done...it really looked like a thick coarse refried beans with a hint of sweetness...not so much either. I had never eated lentils like this before and only tried a could of times in a soup. So as I got done with the 1st step in cooking the lentils in the water and broth I was surprised at what flavor it held on it's own with out having pepper added. having said that...I really liked them before I got started with the 2nd step. I will totally make this again and again. My whole family loved them but my son...but that was to be expected. Looking at this recipe the one thing I changed but it's because I didn't want a high sugar content to it was change to a sugar free alternative to the honey. It was just delish! And to think lentils are soo high in protein amazed me. 1/4 cup of cooked lentils yields 10 grams of protein!! This makes me very happy. Do try this recipe. it was really really great.",

I try to cook low-sodium and after adding chicken broth and soy sauce, I figured I needed to reduce the salt.  They were still delicious and anyone who wants more salt could just add some to their portion. Thanks for a great recipe sassymom!",
