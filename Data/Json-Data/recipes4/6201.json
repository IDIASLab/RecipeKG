With the exception of the white wine, which I really liked, this is the way I've been making Beef Stroganoff since I was a young girl in the early 60s, from a paperback Sealtest cookbook! (Any of you out there old enough to remember Sealtest Dairy?)  Two minor criticisms, however.  First, it is counterintuitive to cook a pretty decent cut of meat like sirloin for \"two to three hours.\"  \"Back in the day,\" when I was making this with round steak, it was indeed necessary to simmer (braise) the meat in beef broth for an hour and a half or so to ensure tenderness. But with sirloin, once browned it didn't need much longer on the stove than it took to pull it all together with the remaining ingredients - ten minutes tops.  Second, the wine should be used to deglaze the pan once the meat is browned, not just before serving as the recipe instructs.  You want the alcohol to cook off.  These, in my view, are two important considerations for the success of this dish.  Also, while I did not measure any ingredients precisely, I do know I used more broth and less flour than the recipe directs.   Finally, don't forget to include pepper with the salt! I served this with hot, buttered egg noodles tossed with fresh chives and a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley for garnish.",

I made sure that the recipe simmered for a while before I used the stew meat as the simmering helps tenderize the tougher cuts of meat. When I floured the meat, I added just a little onion powder, garlic powder and fresh ground pepper. I made no other changes. Mine was done simmering at just under two hours. I served this over hot buttered egg noodles. My family INHALED this. Out of the whole skillet, there was a small amount for my husband to take for work the next day. Delicious!",
