There wasn't enough in it to have this be considered a main dish but the addition of this if this was a side dish just didn't work for me. I understand the reasoning behind this though.. to give the dish some texture aside from the softness. It does need something but I am not sure what. I did like the flavor of this dish but it needed a little spice for me to contrast with the sweetness",
