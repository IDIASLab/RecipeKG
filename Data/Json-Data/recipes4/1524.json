I asked for the recipe and of course I didn't get it. I later experimented with some Thai recipes and came up with this final result. We really love this with steamed jasmine rice. It's quite a hot and spicy dish, so if you want it a bit mild, check the curry paste you use first. You can replace coconut milk with evaporated milk, but traditionally, coconut milk is a must.",

It really is a Thai dish, not a Burmese one.  However, since it has a Burmese influence, I thought I'd cook it up and see if it met with his approval.  I substituted the coconut milk for reduced fat coconut milk.  It worked perfectly and he loved the dish.  He suggested that more fish sauce should be added (about 1 Tbsp. more) to give it a more authentic Burmese influence.  Thanks!",

I like to add additional vegetables sometimes (carrots zucchini and straw mushrooms). I keep half the tomatoes fresh (uncooked) and use them to garnish the dish with the cilantro and shallots (see picture). Make sure that when you cook the shallots you cook them well they are best when they are definitely brown and definitely crispy. Finally red curry paste varies widely in how hot it is. Be careful the first time you use a new bottle - it is easy to add more as you go (doesn't have to all be added at the beginning). Frequently I find that there is too much liquid just dump some off. The ratios of liquids are not that important and I frequently just add in the whole can of coconut milk. The liquid is great with the rice so don't stress about how much liquid you have just make sure the flavor is right. Great recipe! A nice dish for the winter because of the nice cheery colors and the spice.",

I ended up adding more about another 1/2 cup of coconut milk (lite) and stirred the cilantro into the sauce. This was a bit salty I would probably use a little less fish sauce next time. Still tasted great. Thanks for the recipe.",

It's one of the better curry recipes I've found on this site - I tend to like more Indian (or Burmese) style curry than Chinese or (shudder) British and it has to be a pretty special red or yellow curry to get me away from green curry.",
