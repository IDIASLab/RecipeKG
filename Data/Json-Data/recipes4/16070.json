This was just what I had in mind.  I loved the festive  and vibrant color from the peppers, and the herbs (I used fresh basil, parsley and thyme, preferring their milder flavor to that of the oregano) gave it the punch of fresh flavor I was after. The addition of the wine was the perfect finishing touch.  The bottom line?  This is a perfect assembly of ingredients, taking the usual ho-hum side dish rice to something unique and special.",

I made the mistake of chopping the onions and peppers together so I stirred the peppers in with the onions from the start.  It wasn't a problem.  I didn't have any red peppers so when the dish was all finished I added a few seeded and diced grape tomatoes for color.  I also enjoyed the taste of them in it.  I used fresh basil from my garden.  This was not only a beautiful dish, it was a very tasty one as well.  I saw Hubby go back for thirds!  There are no leftovers.  Thank you Joey for sharing your recipe!  It's a KEEPER!",
