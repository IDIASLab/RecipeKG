There is zero creaminess or cohesion. You could do this in a pot of water on the stove and save TONS of time and effort. Why bother to make it as a casserole??? It is edible if you are SERIOUSLY hungry....but NOT AT ALL ENJOYABLE. Blech! Off my list permanently. It is missing buttery flavors. It is missing creaminess. Perhaps if made with milk or cream in a roux sauce....something.....even bread or cracker crumbs or cheese would tie these independent loose ingredients together. The casserole only refers to the dish it is cooked in....not the resulting food product. It might be a better soup! At least soup would explain the lack of cohesion. It needs serious casserole-texture help.",

There was not enough room. Instead I put the rice mix and water in the casserole and added the browned chicken. That gave me plenty of room to lightly saute the veggies in the skillet and then I added them to the casserole. Thanks Knorr for providing me the product.",
