The only changes I made was that I added some red onion to it about half way through cooking in the oven and I omitted the mushrooms although I am sure my husband would have loved to have had them. Also it only took about 20-25 min in the oven. Maybe I cut the potatoes pieces smaller-I don't know. But just as long as you watch it and stir it up every 7-10 min it turns out great! It also may have made a diff that I cooked it in a cast iron skillet that I just transferred to the oven. However you do it you are sure to love it. I will for sure make this again (soon) You could easily scale it to any serving amount you want. It would be a great pot luck dish as well. You should try this!",

I halved the recipe and added about a 1/4 of an onion sliced and also used fresh parmesan. I only baked it for 30 minutes but next time will cut the veggies larger and bake for the full hour as the best part of the dish was the crunchy little pieces! UPDATE: I did make this again cubing the potatoes rather than dicing them and baked for 1 hr. We really liked it better the first time with the more bite sized pieces the shorter cooking time was also better for us and the zucchini since it was over cooked this time. I also had used yams the first time rather than sweet potato and I also liked that better. Still love the recipe though. The kids (a picky 5 and skeptical 3 yr old) like the meal too!",

Cooked for a little less than an hour with the potatoes and zucchini cubed about 1/4\" big (used our chopper so all the pieces were the same size). I did have to add salt to taste once on my plate but that may be because the bread crumbs I used were not seasoned. We still enjoyed it though.",
