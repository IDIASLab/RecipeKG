As I type my hands are covered in yellow as if a highlighter exploded all over them from cutting up tumeric root. I had never done that before. Nor had I toasted anise or cinnamon or even seen cardamom pods. Which is why I love this recipe. One thing that confused me was the toasted coconut. I realized mine was sweetened so I went back to the store where my only other option was a whole coconut. My boyfriend had to hatchet it open for me and I'm sure there's a better way to shred and toast it than what I did. It looked a bit like an episode of Lucy. I had a tough time getting the curry paste to become a paste. My blender's motor was struggling so I ended up adding almost a cup of water. Plus is ended up a little gritty so make sure to blend better than I did. But overall this was a fun thing to do on a Sunday afternoon. I delivered some to friends and they raved about it. I'm so glad I tried it! Thanks Azalina!",

I had to add 1/2 C of water extra to get my vita mix to blend the curry smooth but that actually cooked off in the simmer stage fairly quick and at one hour I had a heavenly and very thick and hearty curry. It is a very mild dish so next time I might add a bit more chili- or just leave some seeds in. Very delicious with paratha bread. But rice would have done it too.",

I followed everything as is except I used unsweetened flaked coconut instead of fresh a white onion instead of shallots and coconut oil instead of peanut. I also emitted the fennel seed because I am not a fan. Prep and cooking time definitely follows as stated. If I would make again I would substitute the coconut oil for ghee and take out the coconut entirely. My food processor and blender couldn't puree the coconut fine enough and I ended up having a semi-chunky/chewy curry due to the coconut. Fresh coconut may process better. Due to the flaked coconut and other dry ingredients I also had to add 2-3 cups of water to the blender. I actually used the chili water in addition to tap water. I was iffy about adding the lime and mint at the end because the curry had such great flavor but the addition of both ingredients really brings out other flavor notes. In terms of veggies I might also consider adding potatoes or peas next time. Will make again when I have the time!",
