Hard to dip them if you just melt chocolate. If you don't have the wax you can just spoon some onto a plate or wax paper and roll the ball around in it that's if you don't mind getting messy! edit Just found out they don't recommend that people use the GulfWax anymore so you can just use a tablespoon or 2 of shortening it'll work much easier that way.",

I used natural peanutbutter with no additives so the peanut mixture was not as sweet as it would have been if I used peanutbutter with sugar already added. My Husband likes things not too sweet so he was very happy with the sweetness of these and wouldn't change a thing. I am only giving these 4 stars because I could not get the mixture to come together right away and the mixture really needed some working. I am not sure what the purpose of the milk powder is for and I might try skipping that all together next time. I used a tooth pick instead of a fork because I made my balls smaller incase some people didn't want such a big bit and I felt thr fork would have just broke them apart. I also used chocolate made for dipping or making homemade chocolates and I kep the chocolate on the heat the whole time. This way you can melt as much or as little as you need and just add more as you go.",
