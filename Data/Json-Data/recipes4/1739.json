I found a roast, and a few other sundries, so I get on the pooter and I find this.\n\tMy changes were, not enough mustard so I added enough teriyaki marinade and cheap-o-depot bbq sauce about a half a cup combined between the two) to come up with the required liquids,add a few potatoes and onions to it before I wrapped up the foil and headed out to a mesquite tree fired grill.Hey, I live in Texas. You can't swing a dead cat without hitting a dead mesquite tree.\n\tSo anyway, I wish I could tell you about the leftover sandwiches, but there was nothing left over. the kids ate it ALL!. I will definitely make this again.\n\t... and again and again!\n",
