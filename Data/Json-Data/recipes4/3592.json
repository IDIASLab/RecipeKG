I also put all of the cheese called for on top (not mixed in) and omitted potato chips (put under broiler for about 5 mins to crisp up cheese). Before putting in the broiler, I sprinkled the top with garlic powder, salt & pep. Also added about 2 tbs of french onion dip that was sour cream based for some oomph. Even my casserole snob/exec chef bf loved it...... which means ALOT in this house! Next time I may try to crisp up the tots first since it was kind of mushy, but that is just a minor revamp, that's truly not necessary bc this is great as is!",

I also used only about 1/2 cup of cheddar/mozzarella combo mixed in, then topped it with a handful of the same, plus a good sprinkle of mozzarella, a little parmesan, and crushed jalapeno flavored extra crunchy chips.  Baked it at 425 for about 40 mins, covered with foil for the 1st 25 mins.  The result was fantastic! Topping was awesome! Requested to be put in the regular rotation.  Lots of ways this could be modified!",

I use PAM to grease the pan and that worked just fine....also cut the butter back. It gets too greasy with the original amoutn. I've made it a couple of times and the second time I made a couple of changes to it and it still tasted the exact same. Instead of melted butter I used about 3-4 T. of country crock (quicker and I was just throwing this together). Also I was out of cheddar and used Mozzarella. It was equally as wonderful as when making it with cheddar. This is a great quick throw together type of recipe. I think it could be modified in many ways - my husband said bacon would be good in it...also I've thought about broccoli as well. Anyway great recipe! Thanks!",

I recommend as a lot of people did that you reduce the amount of butter to a couple tablespoons otherwise it gets soggy. Also use a high quality sour cream so that its not watered down. I tried it originally as written. The second time I reduced the butter and added garlic. Instead of a regular onion I tried green onions and did not saute' them and added two cloves of garlic. Just mixed everything together. And I used Ritz crackers instead of chips. It was really delicious. My next time I'm going to go back to the regular onion and try adding ortega chilis.
