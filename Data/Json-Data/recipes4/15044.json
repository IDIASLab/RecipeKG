You can't taste the avocado but you can taste the yogurt above the blueberries. It totally needs a sweetener. My health nut kiddo didn't like it. As she would normally. Possibly the greek yogurt needs to be flavored and you need to add a sweetener to take the tartiness right out of the smoothie.",

So I did a full medium sized avocado,  unsweetened vanilla almond milk, and vanilla greek yogurt, and instead of water I used 100% Ocean Spray juice blend of cranberry, blueberry, &  blackberry (no sugar added). The consistency is nice and smooth, and the color is a nice bright purple and the avocado is flavor is masked by the blueberries and yogurt.",

I think vanilla Greek yogurt (my usual choice for smoothies) would greatly improve the flavor of this smoothie.  I added a bit of vanilla, and I thought that boosted the flavor a little.

I followed the recipe exactly except I had a 1/2 an avocado left about to expire. So I just used the whole half. It gave the smoothie a silky like texture. It was a filling meal replacement and worked fine for me. Not something I would recommend as a blueberry smoothie for a beginner smoothie drinker though. Might be better with vanilla or a sweet yogurt and a couple of ice cubes. As is I rate this about 3.5 stars.",
