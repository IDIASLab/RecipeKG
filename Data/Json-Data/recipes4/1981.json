This worked really well since these are some pretty substantial toppings and the pan pizza held up well. To speed up the process cut your chicken into bite size pieces before sauteing with the bbq sauce. I loved the mixture of bbq sauce and pizza sauce. BBQ sauce alone would be too overwhelming so it was perfect! Used combo of mozzarella and cheddar and left off the cilantro since I didn't think the kids would go for it. My teenagers and my husband loved it!",

I would warn people to be careful when cooking the chicken w/ BBQ sauce---the sauce I used must have had a lot of sugar in it b/c it burned after about 5 minutes on one side. I just peeled the burnt layer off and it still tasted great. Just a word of warning! The sesame oil gave a great taste but we only used 1 TB and 1 TB olive oil so it wasn't overpowering.
