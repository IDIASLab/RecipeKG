Instead of bacon (and the grease) we use real butter to taste and we also add celery to the soup. The spaetzle or dumpling dough we make just calls for egg and flour. I didn't add the water the recipe called for as other reviewers had mentioned problems with the dough being too runny. Thank you for sharing I enjoyed trying this recipe",

Another reviewer mentioned starting with half the liquid it calls for and then go up from there. I agree. I had to add quite a bit of flour to the dumpling dough before it got to a stage where I could actually form it and cut it into pieces. Other than that it is a very good and easy recipe without a lot of ingredients. I saved a little of the water after boiling the dumplings and potatoes to see if it would add some flavor and I also added a few instant chicken bouillon cubes at the end because it tasted a little bland. All in all a wonderful recipe. Even better the next day! Thanks for sharing.",
