        "description": "I agree that this is a very good recipe. My 93-year-old mother-in-law has recently told me that this is the best meal I have ever brought her, and there have been many. All the veggie prep can be done while the onions and bay leaves are simmering. I do add more broth when the veggies go in. The cabbage will add a significant amount of water but the beef flavor is key. It will freeze great in resealable bags for a quick meal so I normally double the recipe when going to this effort, which in my opinion is well worth it. The 2 hour simmering step for the beef can be done the day before.",

I diced up the onion, carrots (used a lot more carrots) celery.  Cooked the beef, added the onions, carrots and celery and cooked that a bit, added the broth & bouillon cube, tomato sauce - brought to a low simmer - added the potatoes and turned the heat down to low and let simmer - just before serving I added the cabbage and let simmer while the rolls baked.  No added salt was needed. Perfectly easy weeknight meal.  This can all be done using the crockpot - start of the stove and finish the simmer and cabbage in the crockpot.",
