While doing AS IS, I thought that the meat had a nice flavor but could need extra seasoning or oomph.  I think that some of the suggestions of onions, garlic or garlic power, or others could help it out.  However, this is a quick slap it together meal and I am ok with not really tweaking it.  I would highly suggest going through the step of putting the sandwiches in the over for 10 minutes!  It takes the crumbly mixture which would normally fall out of the sandwich and nicely blends it with the bread.  Great idea!",

The beef had a nice flavor but you do have to like mustard as it is dominant. I think adding some garlic and onion to the beef would give additional flavor and some depth to this dish. I used garlic salt instead of plain. Mine took 15 min in the oven to heat through. I'd give this one 3.5 stars. Thanks Verno1 I enjoyed trying this and might make it again.",

My husband does not like dill pickles so put hot pepper hoagie relish on his. I put the pepper relish and pickles on mine. I did brown the meat in butter with onion and served in hot dog rolls (all I had) which kept the meat in & less messy. I put white American cheese on before baking. BAKING is a MUST! Do NOT skip that step!!! Tastes like a poor man's Philly Cheese Steak.....this will be a regular lunch item in our house. USE A POTATO MASHER to help break up the meat!!",
