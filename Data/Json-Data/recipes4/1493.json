First I omitted the butter entirely and used 1 egg plus 1 1/2 cups Egg Beaters.  I used half regular cheese and half fat free cheese, fat free croutons and 1/2 C lower sodium, real bacon bits.  I prepared it the night before and cooked for about an hour in a 9x13 pan and did not adjust the milk at all.  It turned out wonderful (not soggy) and this altered version is so much healthier.  I got 8 servings and froze some so I coukd just pull them out of the freezer and reheat in the microwave for a midweek breakfast.  They reheated wonderfully in the microwave. Thank you so much!",

I chose this one over the other bacon/sausage casseroles because of the ingredients that I felt would give it more flavor......i.e. the flavored croutons and mustard.  What a great touch!  I used caesar salad croutons since thats what I had.  I halved the recipe, however, since it was just hubby and I and made it in an 8x8 pan.  Perfect for half the ingredients, which leads me to agree with another reviewer.....if making the full recipe in a 9x13, you should do 1.5 times the recipe, otherwise it will be a bit flat.  At first I thought the bacon was too much, even at 6 slices for halved recipe, but it was perfect!  I used red pepper since hubby doesn't like green.......has a very nice presentation and slices up well.  Oh I still had to cook the full 40 min. even though I halved the recipe.  Very tasty!  Thanks for sharing.  Unless I find a better one, this will make an appearance at the party.",

I replaced the \"soggy\" croutons with potatoes (I used half a bag of frozen cubed hash browns - nuked for about 1 minute), and since I'm not a big fan of bacon, I used fresh Italian breakfast sausage (out of the casings), which I cooked in a skillet, drained, and crumbled.  I used 8 eggs and 2 cups of milk, I only used about 1/3 of a green pepper, and I added a teaspoon of onion powder and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.  This casserole was SO delicious!  I will make it again and again!!   ",

                "reviewBody": "First, thanks to Scott for posting this fantastic recipe!  I was looking for something a bit different that the traditional breakfast casseroles, (which to me are pretty much all the same) for a breakfast at work. I made this recipe EXACTLY as written, (except I used 8 eggs) using Marie Calenders cheese and garlic croutons, 1/2 red and 1/2 green chopped peppers for Christmas, and a really good cut of bacon, and Mexican blend cheese, and put it in the fridge overnight.  Baked in the morning before work.  Easy to layer, croutons on the bottom, then melted butter, cheese, egg/pepper mixture and top with bacon.  The croutons you choose will be crucial to the outcome, so pick something with tons of flavor.  Might seem wierd, but it is crucial. One little trick that may help...cook your bacon until done but not crispy, still soft.  I tore the bacon instead of crumbled, in large chunks, and on top of the dish it looked like big pieces of meat.  (During the cooking, the bacon doesn't become overcooked this way).  When it came out of the oven, it was so beautiful I wanted to take a picture of it!  And, of all the dishes at the breakfast, mine was the one EVERYONE was talking about!  Many requests for the recipe, they wanted to know what was the \"secret ingredient\" that tasted so GREAT (croutons) and several that said they will not make a traditional breakfast casserole again!  Hehehehe!  This recipe made me a superstar at work! LOVE IT!  :)  And...cheesy easy as well.  You can't go wr",
