I only rated it four stars because I made some changes (but I'll try it as written next time): I didn't have fresh cilantro so I used fresh parsley and mint instead I added some minced garlic and canned tomatoes and it still turned out delicious. Oh and I used ground cumin and hot Paprika because I didn't have turmeric. I will make this often both with couscous and without. Thanks for sharing! UPDATE: I have made this soup quite often now with varying ingredients (whatever I had on hand) and I really really love this recipe. It's very versatile and turns out delicious even if you substitute with whatever you have in your fridge/pantry/garden just don't omit the hot sauce and the garbanzo beans. Bottom line: I changed my rating to five stars.",

Seriously my kids praised this soup and had seconds. The hot sauce was added only on an individual basis, for the sake of the kids. My mom n bro came over and each had a bowl, they loved it too.

I added some celery (because most times my soups start off with carrot, onion, and celery. \"the Holy Trinity\" or \"the trifecta\" if you will).  I only had small red skinned potatoes on hand so I used 5 of them instead of the large baking potato. I didn't have fresh tomatoes either so I used about a half a can of peeled diced tomatoes drained (half a 28oz can) and I added them after I took the eggs out so the were only cooking 15 minutes.  I also left out the hot pepper sauce intending on adding it to the individual bowls (because I have 2 small children) but I completely forgot about it.  I was really good!! I'll be sure to put a few dashes of hot sauce in my bowl for lunch tomorrow. ??\nOh and hubby hates couscous so we ate it just as is!",
