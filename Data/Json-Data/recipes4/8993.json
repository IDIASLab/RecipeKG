The third time I used Dover Sole instead which was just as good. I posted a photo which you may be able to see above. It is missing the tomato and celery unfortunately. My husband was on a diverticulitis diet at that moment so we omitted these two ingredients. It was still quite a lovely recipe even without them. Next time I will use cod just to have some variety in the fish we are consuming. My husband and family also love this new favorite. It is easy to prepare - the timing mixes well with preparations for other courses.",
