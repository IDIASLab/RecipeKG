They look cute so I might try them again at Christmas with a plain (no food coloring added) cookie and dark chocolate or mint chocolate chips. I only had a 2 inch ribbon disk in my cookie press kit which turned out to be too big. If I made them again I would try and find a smaller disk to pipe the dough with. Also you will need 2 small bottles of sprinkles to dip all the cookies in. One in definitely not enough.",

Since I was making it for Halloween I split the dough in half and dyed one half bright orange and the other a deep purple. When assembling them I made all the cookies half orange half purple. I then used bright green sprinkles. They turned out beautiful. For those who think they're a little rich or too sweet try not dipping them into the white chocolate and sprinkles after they're assembled. They're great just as a standard sandwich cookie. I used the advice from some of the reviewers to increase the sugar and I think it helped the taste. These are wonderful and versatile for any holiday. Will try with dark chocolate next time for Christmas.",
