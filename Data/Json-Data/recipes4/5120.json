I don't know if it would make a differnce but I think I would prefer the chunks. I served it over rice. The thin soup base it makes is delicious over rice. I really enjoyed it but husband did not care for it. He said it reminds him of pot roast which I love and he does not care for. That is the type of dish it is. I was expecting it to have a little more \"spice\" flavor to it but I do like really strong flavors. After tasting it I did add salt to my plate which helped improve the flavor a lot. I love the easiness of the this recipe-I actually used frozen chicken tenders. And it is healthy too.",

We all tasted it but no one ate it; none of us could figure out how to make it work for us and we really like like Jamaican food. Thanks for the recipe but we won't be making it again.",
