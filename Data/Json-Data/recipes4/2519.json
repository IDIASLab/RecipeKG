It really helps the pork stay moist and tender since so much of today's pork is too lean.  I pulled my roast out at 145, let rest under foil until 160.  I used the broiler to crisp the bacon the last 5 minutes of cooking time.  I added 1 cup of wine, 1 tablespoon cold butter to the pan juices, simmering for 10-15 minutes while the roast rested for a quick pan sauce to serve over the roast.",

The bacon never got crispy, but added good flavor. Make sure you use a meat thermometer, they say if its over 150 degrees it's done, but I like to make sure it's at 160 degrees. I did occasionally baste the meat too. Overall I thought this recipe was a hit. The meat had excellent flavor, and it was moist.  I did however feel that there was a bit too much Rosemary. Maybe it would be better to crush the Rosemary and use less of it.  My local grocery store did not have pearl Onions, so I used a sweet onion instead, still tasted great!!! We greatly enjoyed this recipe, Thank you.",

Excellent herb flavor, although for me, a bit heavy on the rosemary.  I used the broiler at the end to crisp up the bacon and it was the best part!  Thanks for the recipe, Wanda.",

                "reviewBody": "PERFECT in every way! I only had dried herbs and it was still amazing!  I only needed about 2 cups chicken stock, 10 slices bacon, 1/2 Tbsp. dried rosemary, 1/2 Tbsp dried oregano, 1 Tbsp. dried thyme, 1 Tbsp dried basil, 1/2 Tbsp. dried sage and 1 Tbsp. minced garlic from a jar.  I froze about 1/2 of it and it tasted great reheated too.  I did brush it w/2 Tbsp of olive oil and seared it first, and then rubbed the herbs on the roast instead of mixing them w/the chicken stock. Then I draped the 10 slices of low sodium bacon horizontally over the roast.  I used 3 baseball size sweet onions instead of pearl onions, and didn't add them until probably the last 30 minutes.  The timing on this recipe was perfect for me as well. It was about 145 or 150 degrees when I pulled it out and rested it under a loose tent of aluminum foil until it reached 160 degrees (about 10 minutes). I had to put the onions back in to cook more while the meat rested. To the pan juices and onions, I added 1 cup of riesling wine, 1 tbsp cold butter and simmered it on the stove for about 15-20 minutes.  It was an amazing sauce to pour over the roast and saved well for leftovers too.  I would be proud to serve this to company or for the holidays.  THANKS AGAIN!!!",

I brine the meat (just soak it in salt water for a few hours drain and wash salt water off) otherwise it gets a bit dry. I also use only dry herbs since we don't have fresh available. Reduce the liquid by almost half - it is still plenty unless you make gravy with it and like your meat drowning. Bake coverd until meat temperature is around 145 then broil until the bacon is crisp. Very very tasty meat with the herbs only the onions are sometimes a bit difficult to sell but I love them and don't mind to eat them alone;-)",
