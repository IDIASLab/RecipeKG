We ended up though creating 4 times the number of cookies called for - if we had made it according to the directions the cookie logs would have been way too big. The end result was thumb-sized cookies. Because  there were so many more cookies I was worried we didn't have enough of the melted chocolate so instead of dipping, just put the melted chocolate in a bag, snipped the end and drizzled. Much faster, same taste. I'm actually glad we didn't dip - might have been too chocolatey. Also, next time might use just a bit fewer chips in the dough - there are a LOT. But overall, delicious, easy and will probably be one of my Christmas standards from now on.",

We ended up with 96 thumb-sized logs that we then drizzled the chocolate over rather than dipping them (since we had so many more to cover we wouldn't have had enough chocolate to dip them.) The dough was very easy to work with and drizzling the chocolate was so much faster than dipping. WAY YUMMY cookies! I will definitely make these again. although I might try lessening the amount of chocolate chips in the dough as there are a TON of chocolate chips and I love shortbread.",

After measuring the chocolate chips and based on other reviews I knew it would have been too much for my taste so I cut the chocolate chips back to 1 cup and ran them through the food processor briefly to chop them finer. Instead of making logs I pressed the dough out to about 1/2 - 3/4\" thickness on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and baked till the edges started turning golden (about 20 minutes) since I was not making logs. I let the cookie slab cool broke it apart and drizzled the pieces with chocolate. Good recipe patticake one I will make again (recipe made for RECIPE GROUP ).",
