Also it wasn't too spicy which is okay because kids were also eating it and they liked it just how it was. But the adults added more red pepper flakes at the table. I was worried it was going to be \"too\" spicy because of other reviews but it ended up to be too mild! This kind of food is supposed to be spicy. I also think one more piece of advice would be not to put in the peppers until later because mine were very soggy. I would make this again but I would add the fresh peppers later lessen the cooking time and add more spice.",

It turned out wonderfully. Near the end of cooking, I threw in some sliced shiitake mushrooms, took the pork out, and let the mushrooms cook down in the sauce. I think next time, I'm going to add a little sugar for a little sweetness, and I'm going to try to find some low-sodium teriyaki sauce...it was really salty. I served the pork with jasmine rice (that I cooked with 2 tablespoons of sugar to 1 cup of rice to counter the saltiness) and shelled edamame. I think this is the best thing that's ever come out of my slow cooker. I also recommend using a slow cooker liner for less mess. Definitely a keeper!",

I had to come up with a homemade concoction to dub teriyaki sauce (Worcestershire sauce, honey, and fresh ginger). This was just the right combination of hot, sweet, and smooth. Don't skip the lime if you can at all help it. Would give it another star, if I could. Served with a puree'd veggie soup, a tossed salad, and rice. Company special and so, so easy!
