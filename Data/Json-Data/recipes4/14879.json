Soooo simple to use.. just dip the tops and let set in fridge! I didn't use the cherries, and the cream that I used for the center was a little different.. I infused my cream stuffed cupcake filling: (1/2 c solid vegetable shortening, 1 1/4 c powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 3/4 marshmallow fluff, 3 to 4 tbsp milk) with some instant french vanilla pudding. Next time will add some more liquid to it or something cuz it was a little grainy from the instant pudding but everyone still raved about them!! BIG success!",

I didn't have heavy cream for the ganache but substitued 2 tablespoons of butter and 1/4 cup of milk which I poured over 4oz of semi-sweet chocolate morsals. Whipping the ganache for 3 minutes gave it more of a thickness without having to spread. Great recipe. Tasty results!",
