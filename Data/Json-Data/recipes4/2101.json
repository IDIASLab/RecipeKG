Regarding the question of Lima & Butter Beans:  There are other names for just about everything in the food world, and in this case, butter beans is the other name for lima beans. There are two common varieties of lima bean \u2014 the baby lima bean and the Fordhook \u2014 but don't confuse them as the same bean in different stages of development. The Fordhook is larger, lighter in color, and has a stronger taste than the baby lima, but it is not a grown-up baby \u2014 it is a separate variety. \n\nIn the south of the United States, Fordhook lima beans are commonly called butter beans. Many southerners wouldn't recognize the name lima bean.  \n \n",

I didn't have marjoram so I substituted poultry seasoning which seemed to work well. I also used 6 strips of bacon rather than 3 and I added some chopped ham as well. Served it to a friend who said she didn't think she liked lima beans before but she loved them cooked this way! I am ALWAYS looking for new soup recipes and now this one's added to my archives.
