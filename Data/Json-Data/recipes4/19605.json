Cooked on high pressure for 15 mins instead of 18; used bone in chops about 3/4 inch thick (that's why I cut the time down and they were falling off the bone). Will definitely make again, good flavor, lots of gravy left over or to use on potatoes or risotto!",

Since the pork chops were frozen I didn't sear them first. And I didn't have fresh garlic so I used garlic powder. It came out amazing! I thought the gravy smelled weird but it tasted great. The meat literally fell off the bone (not exaggerating I pulled a very clean bone out of the Instant Pot and another fell off while eating). I have never had pork chops that tender and juicy before. And from frozen solid! I love this recipe and I love how easy it was to adjust to what I had on hand. It was a spur of the moment \"let's have pork chops\" type of dinner and this was perfect for it.
