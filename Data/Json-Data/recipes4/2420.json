I don't think I experienced the issue with the salt that others did since I always use homemade unsalted stock and unsalted butter when I make my stew/gravy.  It is always best to adjust seasonings at the end, but if you use canned/prepared stock or cubes, go light on the salt and you can always add more towards the end.  Thanks for a great recipe!
