I had to make a few substitutions such as I only had 1 cup of chicken broth so I also added a 1/2 tsp  of the solid \"better than boullion\" in the jar to make up for the 1/4 c of broth. To make it less fat I combined both 1/2 & 1/2 and the heavy cream. Also, I did not have the garlic spread, so I mixed in 3 cloves of garlic to the green onions and chopped them up together.  I will be making this again.",

Instead of heavy cream I used equal amount fat free evaporated milk which gave the dish that same creamy feel but for less fat and I used whole wheat linguine. This was a very simple dish that my family enjoyed. I'm always looking for a way to use Johnny's Great Caesar Garlic Spread and Seasoning--this dish was perfect for it. Next time I'm going to try this with BLSL chicken breasts. I bet it would be just as good.",
