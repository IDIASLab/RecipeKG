Obviously, in order to begin with it boiling I just went ahead and did it on top of the stove. I didn't have chili sauce so I used a package of dry taco seasoning and it was fine. But 6 hours of simmering boneless chicken on top of the stove (or in the crock pot) is WAY too long. I used bone-in thighs and after about 3 hours I had tasty, tender chicken. The ingredients are great and the flavors good, but the directions here cannot be trusted.",
