I could not cook this the same way I made whole wheat flour tortillas because this breaks apart if rolled out thin. If left thick these 4\" cakes couldn't be called tortillas. Either way they fell apart when cooking! With a desire for gluten free tortilla shells possibly substituting another kind of flour for some of the gluten free flour might help!",

Tweaked the baking powder a bit less and the second time making these, used coconut oil in place of the shortening. I believe my third attempt to be better the last one...these tortillas are worth trying, very good flavor and texture. Will try making these with an alternative for the xanthan gum after a few more times.",
