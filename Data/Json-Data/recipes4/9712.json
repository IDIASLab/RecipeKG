I used way more than 4 cups of broccoli, I had brought 3 big bunches (almost 4 lbs.) and used all of it, also I kind of lost track of time and cooked it longer which was fine for us since we prefer our broccoli softer vs. crunchy. Cooked it in a big 6qt pot but still used 4 cups of broth. I also used vegetable broth instead of water, 1/2&1/2 instead of milk, and added a finely chopped garlic clove and 2 finely chopped carrots with the onion and celery. I had to use some of the liquid to puree the broccoli, so I thought it was going to end up too thick and I would need more liquid at the end, but it was actually an excellent creamy consistency. Thank you for such an excellent recipe and for the extra ideas in the many detailed reviews! I will be making this soup over and over and over!!!",

I used about 6-7 cups broccoli and instead of water I used chicken broth (5 cups) or so - enough to cover the broccoli while boiling.  I put ALL the broccoli in the blender using some of the reserved stock.  1% milk worked great - and I did add garlic to the other veggies - cooked them for about 6 minutes.  I also reserved 1/4 cup milk at the end and added it with about 1tbsp cornstarch to thicken. Season with salt and pepper - and this one's a winner.",

I also sauteed a minced garlic clove in with my onion/celery. I pureed/chopped ALL of the cooked broccoli in my food processor before adding it back into the soup. I added the cheese to the soup after it was thickened with the milk. I did hold out 1/3 c. of the milk because I wanted to make sure it would be thick enough. I added just short of a TBSP of cornstarch to that saved milk and stirred it into the soup for added thickness. I have never added nutmeg to my broccoli soup and I think this addition is quite a pleasant surprise.",
