The first batch I made I followed recipe exactly except for leaving out the bacon cuz we have a vegetarian in our group, and made some changes for the 2nd batch which made it even better (I think!). I reduced the milk to 3 cups whole, 2 cups 1% (cuz that's what we have on hand), and 1 cup chicken broth. (Because the soup is so darned thick and extremely rich!) I also sauteed 1 finely minced carrot for a minute or two, then added 1 minced onion and 1 minced celery stalk til all was soft and tender, then put in a minced garlic clove and sauteed for about another minute. Pureed the entire thing in my Cuisinart and stirred it into the soup along with the cheese, et al. Gave it even MORE flavor--totally over the top! I then ended up stirring the two batches together and dumping the entire thing in my crock pot! I put chopped green onion, bacon, cheese and sour cream in little bowls for everyone to top as they wanted. Yum!",

And I kept adding milk to it to thin it out during cooking (definitely no need for whole milk.)  I added more black pepper, no salt (didn't need it) and used real bacon pieces.  I also cut up about half the potatoes into chunks and the rest I chopped more finely.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!  It's a keeper.",

I also substituted vidalia onions for green onions and replaced the whole milk with skim. You can try soy bacon bits, but I find they become soggy. Also try adding chopped potato skins (it has all the nutrients) to the soup to make it chunkier, or add milk continuously to thin it out. Even though I now need a full membership to the local gym due to this soup, it's worth it. Thanks!",

Delicioso! p.s. I have also made a lower-fat version using a combination of Butter and Olive Oil for the butter 1% milk for the whole milk and substituting canadian bacon for bacon. I also used 8 oz. fat free cream cheese and 2 cups of beef broth to substitute for sour cream and substituted laughing cow light cheese (3 triangles of the garlic/herb flavor) for the shredded cheddar......just as good and maybe better!!",
