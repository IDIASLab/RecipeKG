This is really a standard short crust pastry but using the food processor really cuts down on time and you don't overwork the dough which makes pastry tough.  A couple of tips - I cut the butter into cubes and stick them in the freezer to really firm up.  Pulse the flour and salt together, add the chilled butter and pulse just enough to form pea sized crumbs. Use ice cold water and add it as you are pulsing the dough.  Be careful to not add too much water - test by taking a pinch of the dough and squeezing it together - it should not be sticky but just hold together.  Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently pat it together.  I then rolled it to fit the pie pan and placed it in the refrigerator.  I used this for chicken pot pie and I did not blind bake it.  I doubled the recipe - for a top and bottom crust, used an egg wash on the top crust and baked at 400.  The result was a nice, flakey tender pastry.",

This is indeed a classic pastry recipe and it works beautifully! I made two crusts using a food processor and blind baked them. They are about to be filled with Lemon Meringue III. I can tell from handling to pastry and seeing them come from the oven that these will be wonderful crusts. Be sure not to overwork the dough and use water either from the fridge or use water with ice cubes strained out. Stop processing before it totally comes together. Turn it onto a lightly floured surface and fold together just a few times until it forms a ball. Wrap in plastic and put it into the freezer for 20-30 minutes. Then roll it out. If it shrinks at all as you roll it, put it back into the freezer immediately or before filling. This will prevent gluten from forming and will yield a tender, flaky crust. You can also freeze the crust tightly wrapped either before or after rolling it and forming the crust in the pan. Sorry, I already filled the crusts; I'll take a picture next time.",
