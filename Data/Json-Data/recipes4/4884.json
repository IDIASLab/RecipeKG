I varied the recipe only a bit, using a bone-in chuck roast that weighed about 2 1/2 pounds. I reduced the quantities of most of the other ingredients about one third (not exactly, just eyed it). I had chipotles in adobo in freezer (great way to store them if you don't use a whole can) and I threw in 4-5 fat ones. I also used home made beef stock instead of water and beef bouillon. Cooked for about 7 hours then shredded and returned to the juices as stated. Served on flour tortillas with some jalapeno poppers (from this site) and some beans. A fiesta in your mouth!",

Next time I will try half the can of chipotle peppers or maybe I will try to seed them since I know the heat is in the seeds. Update: I tried this again with 1/2 can chipotle and I seeded and chopped the chilis. The heat was much more contained but I discovered that the flavor was all in the heat. Without the heat it was kind of bland and watery from the crock pot. Since the heat makes it impossible to feed to most humans and the lack of heat makes it plain shredded beef that isn't really tasty on a taco I have to downgrade my rating. I won't be trying this a third time.",
