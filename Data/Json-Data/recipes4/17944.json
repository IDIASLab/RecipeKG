Put anything you like in the center, Ume (Umeboshi = pickled plums),   Bonito flakes & a bit of Soy sauce, any sushi grade fish, tuna or egg salad (kewpi Mayo is the best for this) or Tamagoyaki even Spam . Use a good grade of short grain rice so it is nice and sticky and there are real cheap shapers you can find to make whipping them out real easy. I prefer putting on the Nori right before eating so it does not get soggy.",
