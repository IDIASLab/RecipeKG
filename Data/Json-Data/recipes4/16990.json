First I used my own meatballs; second I bought a loaf of french garlic bread and toasted it on both sides so as to avoid the reported sogginess (to the point of being more like croutons); Third I eliminated the water all together; Fourth I used Fresh Mozzarella cheese (not packed in any liquid but just fresh) and last change I made was to use Ricotta cheese instead of the Mayo. I baked the casserole until the cheese was melted and bubbly. The smell and taste was fabulous HOWEVER the bread although toasted very well was soupy. Because of this the meal was just unappetizing. Although the taste was very good the soggy bread ruined the entire casserole. My husband did go back for seconds however he just scraped off the top of the casserole taking just the meatballs and cheese. The Ricotta cheese instead of the Mayo was an outstanding recommendation. Thanks for the recommendation.",
