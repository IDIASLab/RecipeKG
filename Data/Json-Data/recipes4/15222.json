I was pleasantly surprised and now wish that I would have thought to take a pic of the stew so you could have a photo for your fantastic recipe!  I'm not a huge fan of beef stews usually, but using the base of spaghetti sauce made all of the difference to me (I used Ragu original meatless).  I tried to follow the recipe as closely as I could while using the items that I had on hand.  The only changes that I made were using 2 cans of mixed veggies, rather than frozen, because that's what I had, and I used plain diced tomatoes since I didn't have any with chili's, but I did add a sprinkle of chili powder and a little bit of dried jalapenos to give it the kick that it was missing from the chili's.  I also used 2 cans of beef broth, to replace the water and bouillon (I was trying to clean out some pantry canned goods, can you tell? lol).  I let this cook on low in the crock pot while I was at work all day, which was about 9hrs or so.  I severed this over homemade parmesan chive potato pancakes with a dollop of sour cream on top.  I have to say this was one of the most successful soups or stews that I've made and we love, LOVED it!  Thanks so much for such a great and easy recipe!",

Also I couldn't find buillion and I didn't have beef broth so I just added a ton of garlic powder. I like that it is a thicker stew and I loved the ground beef. I had a ton of leftovers but I don't feel bad about eating them. It is delicious. Try scaling back though unless you want a week's worth of stew. Also I was in a hurry so I cooked it on high for 4 hours. It turned out okay but would have been better with the suggested time.",
