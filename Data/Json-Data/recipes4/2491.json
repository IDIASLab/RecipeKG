The only problem for me was the cooking time wasn't nearly long enough. My potatoes(which I diced) were still hard and even the peppers were a little crunchy. And I needed to add cornstarch to the broth to make it thick as it was more soup-like. Next time I'd let this cook all day 8-10 hours on low. Maybe add a few more spices to kick it up a bit. Not that it needs it just sometimes we like our stew a little spicy.",

Two changes I would absolutely suggest:  cook much longer (5-6 hrs on high, 10-12 hrs on low) and add the milk in the last hour.  I researched adding milk to slow cookers and this prevents curdling/or separating.  Like others, I adapted ingredients to what was on hand, adding carrots and cannellini beans in place of the peppers.  As in all my crockpot stews, I used 3 Tbl quick-cooking (Minute brand) tapioca for thickening instead of cornstarch, though I did coat the meat with flour before browning. ",
