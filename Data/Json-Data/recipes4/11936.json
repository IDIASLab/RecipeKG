I am not a black eyed pea eater but my husband is and being Southern we have to have this every New Year's Day. I read the other reviews and adjusted the water level- I think this is a common sense issue. Just eyeball the water. When you cook beans that have been soaked you generally boil them in fresh water that just covers the beans. Same here. Add more water as needed while they boil. I did not use as much ham but cut it into bite size pieces before serving. I added another bay leaf and kicked up the fresh ground pepper. This dish thickens as it cools so do not worry about it being too soupy. I did not serve it over rice but as side dish to oven baked ribs (find the recipe on this site). Of course there was plenty of sweet cornbread. My husband said this was my best batch of black eyed peas yet (that's 15 attempts- one for every New Year's Day we have been together). Not quite as good as his momma's but pretty good for a Yankee born wife who doesn't eat black eyed peas.",

The ham hocks gave it a nice flavor. I will make it again and next time I will had chunks of ham.",

I soaked the peas overnight then drained and rinsed them. I diced up one pound of bacon and fried it in the pot until just shy of crispy then I drained the grease and added six cups of water (as suggested by reviewers) the peas a little salt a little pepper and three bay leaves. After cooking for about 1 hours or so I found the bacon to be tasteless (and I love bacon!) but the peas tasted pretty good although our three-year old refused to touch them. This was awesome with soy sauce on it! If I try it again I'll probably use bacon again but I'll mix the fried bacon in with the cooked-and-drained peas just before serving.
