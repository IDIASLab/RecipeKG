I cooked mine to 120. you can cook it from 115-125. Many Cooks use this method of reverse searing, look it up. This is not the only person using this method. This is the best way, you won't regret it. just remember, when you pull it out, use the foil to canopy for 20 minutes, while you preheat your oven to 500. make sure your oven is at 500 before you put it in. Reverse searing cooks the meat more evenly inside instead of an overdone outer meat. Also, don't worry about losing juices because you didn't sear it ahead. They have found, it does not make a difference as the juices still remain perfectly juicy. No worries",

Carryover temp maxed at 134 after a few minutes (the lower the roasting temperature, the less the carryover cooking I gather). This seemed like a pretty perfect medium rare. I can't imagine what it would've been like if I pulled it at the suggested 115 degrees #rawAF?\nThe reverse sear is a winning technique though and I will be using it again in the future on other foods. I read a number of recipes for prime rib and followed parts of several of them, but this one was the most influential. I saw one recipe that said to dry brine with salt a couple days in advance, but I'm not sure how much flavor that actually imparts or if it's more to retain moisture. Anyway, the beef was a hit.",

                "reviewBody": "This was a great framework to make some minor adjustments too. Firstly i'd suggest cooking to 130 as prime rib does better at a medium than a medium rare I believe. I love medium-rare steaks but the prime rib cut just does a better job with a little more cooking.\n\nSalting the day before makes a huge difference too with the crust of the roast, don't forget to salt and let it dry out for at least an overnight period!\n\nCooking time does take a long time with this method depending on how well your oven does at a low temp at 200 so give yourself more time than you think you need. You can have the roast rest under aluminum foil for up to 2hrs.\n\nThe butter rub really makes this a special roast too, just throw in a bunch of fresh garlic ,thyme, rosemary and some cracked black pepper. It'll be an amazing dish you won't regret!",
