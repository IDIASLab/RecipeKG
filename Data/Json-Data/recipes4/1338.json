I came to this site (and several others) specifically looking for it. I don't know what chef you guys mugged for this recipe, but it's as good as any that I had when I lived there!! I made my first batch using the wrong fish, (fresh catfish), and it was still delicious! Warning, if you use anything other than whiting or white fish, the seasonings have to be increased considerably! I serve this with sliced jalapenos, crackers, lemon wedges,and celery. Yummy with a capital Yum! Thanks Chuck & Chris!! Someone in Texas is really delighted to have this recipe!!!",

I was apprehensive that the taste would be bland, because the recipe lacks some of the \"usual gang of suspects\" in a dip, such as cream cheese, garlic, onions, etc.  No worries, this allowed the flavor of the fish to come out.  And it's low-fat!  This dip will now be my standard dish to take to dinners and events.",

I just made mine and it's terrific.  Here's what I did to modify the recipe... I used tilapia, just a plain white fish (because that's what I had in the refrigerator).  I marinated with lime juice.  I cooked the fish in a pan with just a tiny bit of butter on high heat so it got crusty on the outside... just a few minutes on each side if the fish is thin.  No need for a messy food processor!  I sliced into tiny pieces, but in a bowl with all the ingredients in the recipe EXCEPT, I was liberal with the Old Bay and the cracked pepper.  A little bit of garlic powder thrown in, too.  Also, if you're serving this as an hor d'oeuvre for a crowd, you'll want to double the recipe.  Use an ice cream scoop to make a rounded serving or two on leafy lettuce.  In Florida, fish spread is served with Captains wafer and sometimes Tortilla Chips.  Hope that helps!",
