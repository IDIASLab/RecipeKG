I added 1/2 cup more each of all purpose and wheat flours and then added more flour as necessary while kneading to make it smooth. My husband just has sauce and cheese on his half while I topped mine with sauce thin sliced roma tomatoes broccoli and mozzarella cheese. It was fantastico!:)",

As for flavor, this recipe is clearly a five star. I made a thin crust pizza and the crust was crunchy yet easy to bite. Because my sauce has all the herbs in this recipe, I did not add them. Instead, I added Spanish Cracked Anise. (Penzy's.com) After making the pizza crust, I had more than half the recipe remaining. Because of the quantity yeast, I let it rise in a breadpan and baked it as a loaf of bread.(30 min @ 350 degrees.) It turned out a beautiful loaf that is light to eat and very flavorful. Made great toast with butter. I intend to use it for Garlic bread, Bruchetta and croutons.",
