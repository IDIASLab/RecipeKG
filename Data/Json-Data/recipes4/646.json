The first time I made it, I did the following: I followed the advice of a few other reviewers and used 8 eggs instead of 6, and cooked the onion with the sausage. I also tossed in some diced green peppers and onions with the potatoes that I shredded, and I baked the crust separately. The second time I made it, I used frozen hash browns instead of shredding my own potatoes. I just tossed the frozen hash browns with diced peppers, onions, and melted butter, and baked at 375 for about 30 minutes. The frozen hash browns hold up much better than using grated potato hash browns, probably because frozen hash browns are thicker. The fresh grated hash browns were by no means bad, but the frozen hash browns had better taste and texture. Also, the second time I used ricotta cheese, and I gotta say, I liked the cottage cheese better. Again, the ricotta was not bad, but the casserole made with ricotta came out kind of spongy, if you will. The casserole made with the cottage cheese was more moist and, in my opinion, more flavorful. The cheese flavor of the ricotta was more subtle than the cottage cheese, and again, the ricotta gave the casserole a spongy (almost dry) texture.\nI also agree with the reviewer who used 4 cups of hash browns instead of 3. HOMEMADE SAUSAGE: 1LB GROUND BEEF, 2t GROUND GINGER, 2t GROUND SAGE, 3/4t SALT, 1/2t BLACK PEPPER, PINCH CAYENNE PEPPER.",

You're making this EVERY Sunday!!!\"  She's pretty reserved, so this was huge.\n\nI plan to make this for Christmas morning.

I think that this is a decent recipe, but it is very, very bland and really lacking any WOW.  If you are serving to small children or to the elderly it might be passable.  It is fine for getting rid of some leftovers, but as the recipe currently is, I would not serve this to guests as is.  It requires many changes and by the time the changes are made, it is a new recipe, not at all the same as the recipe here.   When I made this recipe the first time, following the recipe exactly, I felt it was bland, it lacked any flavor and definitely needed major modifications.  I added the onion and some green pepper to the sausage and cooked them together.  I ended up adding a can of well- drained diced tomatoes to the sausage as well.  I only had large eggs, not jumbo, so I used nine large eggs.  I added a bit of onion powder and a clove of crushed garlic to the egg mixture, as well as a bit of black pepper.  I felt it needed a bit of extra flavor.  I also used sharp cheddar cheese ... shredded myself, never from the package.   I used half of the cottage cheese the recipe stated, combining the other half with sour cream.  I used store bought shredded potatoes, but added some salt and pepper to the potatoes as well.  I assembled the entire casserole the night before and baked in the morning.  It takes longer to bake than the recipe calls for.  In my convection oven it took about 1 hour and 20 minutes.  Even ",
