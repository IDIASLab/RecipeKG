Thanks for a great base recipe for sugar-free cookies, I will play around with this to perfect it to my tastes! NOTE: I made again with Simply Jif and they turned out fabulous! I've found that I need to bake them 2-5 minutes longer than the 8 min the recipe calls for...",

Of course they are not going to be of the same texture and taste of a traditional peanut butter cookie however given the parameters I found these cookies to be an exceptionally delicious and satisfying alternative for those who must or choose to limit their consumption of simple carbohydrates. My tips: Start out with less Splenda for your first attempt and adjust to taste with subsequent batches. (I used only 1/2 C. as I prefer subtle sweetness. 2 C. would have been far too much for my taste.) Add 1 t. of vanilla. Roll dough into approximately 1 inch balls (bite-sized) and flatten with the tines of a fork in a crisscross pattern as with traditional PB cookies. (I believe that this step helped to avoid the crumbling issue that others have cited.) I cooked mine for 10 minutes though ALL OVENS VARY so watch for signs that your cookies are dry and set in the center. Cool on pan for about 1 minute before attempting to GENTLY transfer with a spatula to a wire rack to cool further (at least half an hour or more). I used Smucker's natural creamy peanut butter. As an aside I always use air-filled baking sheets as in my experience they virtually eliminate the problem of overcooked bottoms on cookies.",

Edit to review; I've since tried with low fat p-nut butter & like them but hubbie didn't enjoy as much says they didn't 'melt in his mouth'.",
