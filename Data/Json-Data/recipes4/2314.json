That way you only have to mess with the dough the day you are going to make them. Also, after boiling the perogies, we always saute them with butter and onions before eating. Fry perogies until a light golden brown.  Little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Don't burn your onions. gently saute until translucent.  A dollop of sour cream when serving is a nice additon.",

By themselves, they are a bit bland, but with the cottage cheese they are fantastic. \nFor the filling, I omitted the prepared cheese sauce and added more grated cheese and a little milk & butter.\nWe liked them so much that we wanted to have family dumpling cook-off, trying different types of filling. With some leftover dough we made dessert dumplings filled with cherry pie filling which were also very good. ",

Even hubby said to just go to the store and buy a bag! Which, of course, to me was an invitation to an immediate challenge!!  It took some doing, but 4 hours later~VOILA!! Very time consuming, as I was all alone, but I highly recommend an assembly line of family members to quicken to project!! I, on the other hand, love to do it all myself, taking all the praise...HAHA!! Luckily, they were an IMMENSE hit with my family, even my 11 year-old, who never eats perogies, EVER!!!  I must say that rolling out the dough was a struggle, then I cut them into perfect circles, which shrunk to 1/2 the size once I picked them up.  Easy to fix, just mashed them down with my fingers, kind of like pizza into a pan.  I then overstuffed them and pinched closed with floured fingers, and froze.  I ended up with 58 perogies and still extra filling, which I froze for later use, and I made it with mashed potatoes, cheddar, real bacon, fried onions, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder.  YUMMY!!!  My husband and his buddy who is here from Newfoundland, went on for hours about them and my cabbage rolls.  The best compliment is when they say \" this is even better than my mom's!!\" LOVE THAT! Permanent recipe in my rotation and thanks a bunch, ever so much!! LOVELY!!!",

Filling well that is up to you and what your into... I like onions fried in butter and simple easy....cheese whiz. Makes for great freakin perogies!

Double the recipe and it makes about 6 dozen perogies. I needed to add a little more flower then what was recomended.

In my second batch I used minced onions in the potato mix and a whole lot more of cheese and added some all purpose seasoning/everglade seasoning. After I boiled the perogies I sauted them in light oil with more onions just to brown and crisp them. I can eat them plain but my family likes a little alfredo sauce over them. Great Recipe!!

Maybe I'm just not used to the texture but for me they weren't so great! Also I would use just 6 potatoes instead of 8 or you will have leftovers. When I finished I ended up just frying them and they tasted much better. I may make these again but I'll change up alot things!!",
