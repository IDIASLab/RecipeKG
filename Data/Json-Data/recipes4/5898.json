As many others mentioned cut the amount of 7-up. I had been given another version of this recipe and after reading the comments decided to go with a half cup of 7-Up measuremment from that recipe instead a full cup mentioned here. All the other measurements were exactly the same. PERFECT BISCUITS. Second don't just butter the bottom of the biscuit dish. Butter the tops of the biscuits as well. It gives the finished biscuit a nice golden color. They're fabulous!!",

I melted the butter in the pan that I was going to cook the biscuits in instead of adding to the dough mixture. I patted out the dough on a lightly dusted surface (with bisquick) to fit my 9 in square pan and used a biscuit cutter to cut my biscuits. I then added the cut biscuits to the melted butter in the 9 in pan. This is definitely a keeper. I think next time I make these I am going to pat out dough to fit my 9 in square pan and use a pizza cutter and cut into 9 pieces. Thanks for sharing this great recipes.",
