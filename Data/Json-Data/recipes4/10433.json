Stir cornmeal over med heat until it is dough-like consistency. Our CHRISTmas morning tradition has been Red fried cornmeal mush one year and Green the next. Doing it in the oven at 400 degrees for 10-15 minutes(per side) was a real blessing, and tasted terrific. (I still made a few on the stovetop, as I like mine real crispy. The rest of the family LOVED the oven done ones. Jam, syrup, powdered sugar- goes well with just about anything.",

My hubby and I had it at a Bob Evans when we traveled to a wedding in Chicago and loved it.  Naturally, I was pretty excited when I saw it in the market knowing how much he loved it.  So I searched for a recipe that would work and was pretty much unsuccessful until I found this one!  This one is *perfect*!  I changed nothing at all.  The only thing I would do different now is double the ingredients so that I will have a loaf sized slice.  I have a large loaf pan that I turned the mixture out into, so don't try this tip unless you have one of those larger Pyrex style loaf pans.  My husband loved it and I can now make his favorite again.  Looking at some of the other reviews that have the meat incorporated in them have piqued my interest as well!  Thanks so much for posting this....we loved it!!! :)",

I went to look at other fried mush recipes on other sites and saw that most of them tell you to cover and simmer for an additional twenty minutes or so.  All I know is, this recipe, the way it was posted is not firm enough to slice.\n\nThe recipe on the package of cornmeal actually worked much better than this one.  It called for three cups of boiling water, one cup of cold water.  Also it said to cover and simmer for fifteen minutes after the cornmeal started to boil and thicken.  Without the extra cooking time, the cornmeal will never set up.  I know this, because I ruined three batches before I tried the recipe on the package.",
