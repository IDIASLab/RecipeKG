In our family we included if you can believe it a teaspoon or more of prepared horseradish! Gives it a kick and is completely bizarre to wrap your head around but it works. Ours also used walnuts from the family farm in Gridley CA. This recipe made me very nostalgic for wonderful holidays during my youth. THANKS!",
