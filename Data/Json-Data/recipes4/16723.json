I highly recommend adding the lemon juice, but if you like, make as directed (I do recommend decreasing the olive oil to 1/3 cup AT MOST), and taste. If you like it as is, don't make additional changes. If you don't, add the lemon juice! It has a much lighter, fresher taste! Oh yeah... I only cooled the quinoa slightly before adding the remaining ingredients, as I wanted to serve it as a hot dish. It worked fine!",
