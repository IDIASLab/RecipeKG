It was beautiful and tasty but I'm only rating the recipe three stars because I had major trouble with the directions. I ended up having to throw my first attempt out because despite following the directions exactly the layers melted one another and formed one big black unappetizing layer. My second attempt however I decided to stir in 3/4 cups of ice cubes instead of the water to bring down the temperature of the gelatin before adding it to the solid layers. That worked MUCH better. I also let them solidify for a full 60 minutes instead of 45. I read on the internet that there might be problems with letting them completely solidify because the layers may end up separating when they are unmolded but I had no problems with that (of course I didn't \"unmold\" the layers because they were in a trifle dish...but when dishing out the layers they adhered perfectly).",
