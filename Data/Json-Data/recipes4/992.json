I modified the recipe a tad by adding finely shredded mild cheddar to the whipped cream cheese--and instead of wrapping the peppers with bacon I but real bacon bits into the cream cheese. I also topped the stuffed peppers with finely shredded cheddar and then baked for 40 minutes (or when the cheese began to look like a finished topping). Again these were a huge success..You betcha I'll be making these all the time--PLUS--this is a great finger food for low-carbers!!! Enjoy!",

So easy too. I used regular cream cheese instead of whipped and it worked fine. i also added a little bit of shredded cheese which did hold in the cream cheese tiny bit of cayenne pepper and the bacon. I ended up turning it up to 425 degrees for the last 10 minutes to get the bacon crisp. Yum Yum! thank you!-UPDATE I have made these little yummy's at least 25 times now. Everyone loves them. We cook them on the BBQ on foil when we go camping all the time.",

I checked the peppers only after 30 minutes baking at 400 degrees and already my bacon that was wrapped on the bottom was burning and some of the bottoms of the peppers were so soft they were almost liquid-like. The cream cheese had practically browned and it was crispy like. I tasted one and it tasted allright and my husband liked them...but there were some I had to throw away because the bacon was burned too bad. I checked it only after 30 minutes if I had waited till 45 minutes after I probably would have wound up pitching the entire batch away. I think I am going to have to reduce the temp on the oven as well as watch it more closely. From what I observe though most of the reviews did not have this problem? I have had these peppers before when my best friend made them and they were amazing. I hope to achieve that next time.",
