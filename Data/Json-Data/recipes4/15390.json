It is thick enough that in stretching it (by adding more pasta and chicken broth to make it more soup-y) for our large family of 8, it still maintained its rich, tomato taste.

I followed the recipe exactly but used ground turkey so I could be more heart healthy and it turned out to be my favorite soup recipe. The whole family loved it as much as I did. I want to make this weekly because it tastes so good and is a great way to get your fill of veggies. Thank you thank you thank you. It was the bomb!",
