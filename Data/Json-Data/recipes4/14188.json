The flavor and texture were very comforting but I would have like a greater punch of flavor so next time I will up the amount of curry paste and vinegar I put in. Salt the chicken before you put it in. I would also mix the curry paste mixture into the rice before I put the chicken in - very hard to distribute the flavors afterwards. I was surprised that the mango wasn't as mangoey as I thought it would be but instead mellowed out and combined with the rice to be like a sticky rice. Maybe jarred mango would actually be better to maintain the flavor. Thank you for a great recipe!",

I couldn't find tarragon vinegar and didn't have time to make it so I substituted white wine vinegar and chopped fresh tarragon.  I also used brown rice so I boiled the water before adding it to the baking pan.  The chicken was a bit overdone so next time I will parboil the brown rice and bake the dish for 45 minutes instead of an hour.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe Nicole!",

The flavors in this dish are really great which is why I am giving it 3 stars however there are lots of changes I would make next time. I feel 1/2 cup rice is not enough. I would up that to 1 cup for sure and leave the water alone so it doesn't turn out so runny. There was way too much liquid. I would also add the cilantro after it is cooked - all the flavor is cooked out by adding it before baking. I would probably add extra mango as well. And when searing the chicken thighs - I would not use so much oil! You will render fat from the chicken - there is no need to add more. I would slap it in the dry pan and sear it nicely to lock in flavors. If I try this recipe again with my changes I will edit and update.",
