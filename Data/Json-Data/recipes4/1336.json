I also used a combination of cheddar cheese and feta cheese, which was good for the texture of the quiche. And, because everyone seemed to stress this, I used an extra egg. I also definitely used some salt :) Anyway, this is a great recipe, and it even yielded two quiches, which were both gone almost instantaneously! Wonderful.",
