Once you mix the ingredients, the batter was similar to a really thick pancake batter. Like pancakes, make sure to leave room in the pan for spreading. That may help with their appearance.

I cut it in quarters afterwards, topped with sour cream and chopped green onions. Such a good breakfast. I won't be afraid now when I have mashed potatoes left overs when we have guests, I even need leftovers :-)\nI want to make things clear for those who said it was bland: If your mashed potatoes were bland, then this will come out bland too. The mashed potatoes should have the right amount of salt and be tasty, then you'll get a great pancake. I don't know how other people make mashed potatoes, maybe they just mash them and that's all. I always add salt, butter, milk, and sometimes a little sour cream and a dash of garlic powder. They are not bland. So my pancake wasn't bland either. Thank you for this recipe!",

Sour cream is the perfect topper.  Great breakfast.",
