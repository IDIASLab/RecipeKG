The only thing common between curry powder and curry leaves is that first word.\n\nCurry leaves serves the purpose of an aromatic. When fried in oil, you will notice they crisp up, not wilt. If you can't find curry leaves, it is best to just skip that ingredient or substitute it with cilantro. Please, not curry powder!!",

I did have to add extra water during cooking - 2 cups was just not enough - it simmered out too quickly. anyways it was good - better than expected and we served it with cornmeal and poppyseed roti from veganomican cookbook - very delcious combo. it's very filling - although not something i'd want to eat all the time - lentils have a very distinct flavor and they are not my favorite but i try to eat them now and again b/c they are good for you and when you choose the vegetarian lifestyle it's nice to try something different once in a while. I have a lot of leftovers and i think i'll make it into soup - i'll add some vegetable broth and chopped tomatoes - and we will use up the rest of the roti as dipping bread then.",

Even with all of these \"americanizations\" the result was delicious and very filling served with flat bread. Will definitely be repeating this one!",
