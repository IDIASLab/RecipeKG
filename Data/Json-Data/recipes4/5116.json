The butter would have melted off too much.  \n\nThis should actually be done in a cast iron skillet, and ingredients should be fresh, not dry/powdered.  That said, it is a pretty good recipe for what is a classic south Louisiana dish.  \n\nI followed this to a T and it IS pretty good.  I'm from New Orleans originally (living L.A. now) and need to build up my home food repetoir!  Thanks for this Paul!",

This is a tried and true, classic and dependable preparation for blackened fish.  I did use grouper, however, as I don't care for catfish.  The blackening seasoning is what really stood out for me - it's a nice, balanced blend, although as a personal preference I backed off on the cayenne somewhat.",
