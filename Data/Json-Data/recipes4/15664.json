I hoped that since the rice was all dolled up that it would make a difference.  It obviously did, because he cleaned up his plate rather enthusiastically.  And indeed, this was surprisingly good, far exceeding even my own expectations.  I did deviate from the recipe, adding some zucchini I wanted to use, using fresh thyme (and no marjoram) rather than ground, and beef broth rather than chicken as I already had a carton opened that I had used for another dish.  I chose to cook the vegetables in butter separately from the rice, adding some fresh minced garlic.  I set that aside until the rice was cooked, stirring it in at the end.  How much my changes influenced the final outcome I can\u2019t be sure.  What I do know is that this was colorful, flavorful, and had great texture.  I started off with slim expectations for this but we ended  up polishing it off. I served this with Salisbury Steak with Mushrooms, and Peas and Pancetta, both recipes also from this site.",

I cut it down to one-third the amount and that easily was enough for six servings. My problem with this was that the vegetables were total mush by the time it was done so I'd caution people to add them just near the very end. I felt it was bland so maybe one could up the seasonings and add some crunch from toasted almonds. I really do like the idea of the combination of the two rices. I'll give this another try with a different method of cooking. Thank you for this!",

I didn't have any chicken broth so I saut\u00e9ed the onions and carrots in about a half stick of butter added water and a smack ramen chicken flavor pack. Added the herbs the wild and brown rice and simmered for about 10 minutes. The crowning touch was the dried cranberries and raisins. I could not get over how flavorful this was the raisins and cranberries delivered a sweet and tangy zip. Along with the thyme and sweet marjoram it was a savory blend. Thank you I needed a start never have made wild rice before.",
