Stewed okra is great, but for a little variety, we like to roast ours from time to time. This is so simple and easy and the okra tends to not be nearly as gummy or slimy when roasted. Chopped tomato makes a great addition when we have some handy.",

If you place them in just enough cold water to cover and squeeze an entire lime into the water and lime juice and just let it sit for about 10-15 minutes, then drain and season to please, I promise it will lose most of the slimy texture you get when stewing, etc...

Keep in mind that the longer you cook it, the smaller it shrinks, so what you think will serve four could end up being barely enough for 2.  ",

I grow vegetables on the deck outside of my apartment and I have one okra plant (these plants grow Tall!, mine is over my head, I'm 5'4\", soon I will need a ladder to pick it:). Since there is only one of me, the one plant provides enough okra so that I need to prepare something every 4 days or so. I always loved it stewed with tomatoes and onions, but I am afraid your recipe has won me over. Love the intense flavor the roasting gives it and you are right, it is less \"wet\":)I did use my combo of tomatoes and onions, but roasted them along with the okra...awesome! I sliced my okra, made thick slices of onion, and halved a small tomato, sprinkled with choppped fresh basil (from my deck garden also), drizzled all with olive oil, seasoned them with Old Bay and just a touch of salt and pepper. I put a shaving of fresh parmesan on my tomato and baked it as directed. Absolutely awesome!!!",

I don't believe I'll ever cook okra any other way. In addition to the okra, I included sliced fresh mushrooms and sliced white onions and used habanero infused olive oil.  The amount of salt called for in the recipe is way too much for the amount of okra listed, but that is a personal preference.  I mixed everything together in a large bowl then emptied it all on to a foil lined baking sheet and roasted as directed.  It had the best texture and flavor and NO slime. Great recipe.",
