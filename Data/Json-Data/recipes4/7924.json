One was to add a can of cream soup to the mix because I like my casseroles moist. My spaghetti squash was huge so I felt one can of condensed milk wouldn't be enough. I grabbed a can of cream of broccoli and that was a nice addition. I also added garlic because I add garlic to EVERYTHING that isn't dessert lol! I probably put more cheese on top than was called for as well and actually added a little mozzarella that I had lying around. Excellent flavor! The bacon bits though not much really added a nice taste to everything. This is my favorite spaghetti squash recipe ever! Thanks so much!",
