I put in slightly less than 1 TBS. thyme, but I think the whole amount would have been fine.  Instead of doing these grilled-cheese style, I assembled them right on a cookie sheet (omitting butter completely) and baked in a 400 degree oven for 11 minutes.  This, to me, is easier, plus it cuts out unecessary calories and fat.  In addition to that, I used half light mayo and half regular.  I also used whole wheat bread.  These were so good!  Messy to eat, but well worth it.",

Great basic recipe! We'll try with other meats and cheeses soon.",

So I spread one side of the bread slices with the butter and grilled until golden. I then assembled the sandwiches as directed not grilling after assembly. The result was a crisp buttery crusty sandwich with a fresh unique filling. They stayed crisp and tasty for several hours. I got rave after rave for these when I served them. I will definitely make them again. (Remember to watch the temperature of these sandwiches if you plan to serve later as the filling contains mayonnaise)",
