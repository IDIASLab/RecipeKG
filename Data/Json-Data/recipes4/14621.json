I found that after boiling the \"ravioli\" stuck together essentially as bacon and cheese filled dumplings. The flavors of this dish are great but I found the texture with the wrappers unpleasant. I'd love to try this recipe again with real pasta dough. As it is I'll be attempting to deep fry the ravioli in the wonton wrappers later this week. I'm hoping that will improve the texture and keep the fantastic bacony-cheese flavor.",

This recipe was originally intended as \"Wonton Skin Optional\" but it seems it was edited by submission. ** If you do use wonton skins, I would suggest using two sheets as you would with normal ravioli. Putting the filling on one sheet, shaping it either round or square flat, and sealing the second sheet over the top using water+egg. This recipe can yield around 30-40 total ravioli when made with 1/2 tbsp sized ricotta portions. For the sauce, freshly grated parmesan also melts much quicker, and gives a silkier finish.",

The ravioli filling was excellent and will definitely be made again. I don't recommend using the wonton wrappers because as has already been said they tend to stick together and rip apart and if they're not sealed perfectly they'll open up and you'll end up with a packet of cheesey-bacon boiling water so you end up with a plateful of wet filling and a few strips of wonton.
