I made the soup part exactly as you said then added a bay leaf and 1/2 tsp of allspice for flavoring. Used McNess soup base a favorite in ND! Hubby like his Knephla to be like noodle so I added another cup of flour and less milk just made to dough consistantly. Then like my MIL does it clipped small bits off the dough ball with the kitchen scissors into the boiling water Hubby said to double the noodle part next time! He ate all I made by himself! Low calorie low cholesteral and so quick!",
