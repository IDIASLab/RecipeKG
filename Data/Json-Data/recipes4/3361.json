I used plain ol' bulk sausage (Jimmy Dean) browned it and then just added the veggies at that point rather than removing the sausage or adding additional oil. I 1/2\" diced both the sweet potatoes and two LARGE red bell peppers and boiled the potatoes 10 minutes -- anything more would have been mush. It makes a lot more than 4 servings in my opinion. Pita bread worked well with it and I could see leftovers rolled in whole wheat tortillas as well. I might try a veggie sausage next time as this is so close to being a very healthy vegetarian recipe.",

Instead of italian sausage I used italian seasoned turkey sausage to make it a little bit healthier. I used spicy chipotle salsa in mine. (I used a 17.5 oz jar...8 would not have been enough.) Chipotle goes really well with sweet potatoes. It wasn't terribly time consuming and it was really easy to make. I added a dab of reduced fat sour cream to the top-delish. I also felt that it was more than 4 servings; more like 6. My friend who had never had sweet potatoes before really enjoyed this dish. I will absolutely make it again.",
