I did use fresh rosemary and freshly-squeezed orange juice and hoped that this would distinguish it from others but the OJ flavor didn't surface even after marinating five hours. The reviews on cooking time seemed to be all over the place but cooking a pork tender to 160 F would produce overdone and dried out meat. We grilled the meat for about 10 minutes to 140 F tented it with foil and let it rest for about 5 minutes which produced perfectly-cooked moist slightly pink tenderloin. This review is not to say that this recipe is bad because it certainly isn't only to say that it was pretty ordinary and a bit of a disappointment.",
