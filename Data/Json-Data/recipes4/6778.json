I usually make a recipe as written when making for the first time; however I was not at all sure that a layer cake would transport easily. So here is what I did: I made the cake as written removed from the pan and cooled. Instead of splitting and filling the cake I made a coller for the pan placed it back in the 9x13 and put the pie filling on top. I then mixed up the pudding and poured it on the pie filling and chilled until solid. I frosted with the Cool Whip and sprinkled pecans on top. I omitted the caramel ice cream topping all togather as I like tart and felt it would add too much sweetness. I will make this again maybe next time with the ice cream topping.",
