I marinated the fish for a couple of hours. My local store did not have fresh jalapeno so I used pickled jalapeno slices...way too hot and I even put in less than the amount suggested. I will cut back even more next time or make it with fresh jalapeno. The leftover salsa was great to eat with tortilla chips the next day. I did add cilantro as other reviewers suggested because it is also my husbands favorite spice. Will make again.",
