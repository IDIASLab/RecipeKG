I was worried that the balsamic would over power the entire dish, but with the long cooking time, it did not.   You could tell it was there and some of the flavor of that came through, but not too much.   If I was to make again, I would add in some carrots and celery and would cut the vinegar by half.  Update:   I raised this recipe to 5 stars based on the left-overs.   The left-overs are absolutely fantastic and I will probably make this again as written just for them.",

I browned the beef late and night and let it cook overnight, while I slept. In the morning, I shredded the beef, and placed it back in the crockpot, set to warm. My daughter and I ran an errand, and came back to have the roast for lunch with Mom. We love onion cooked with roast beef, so I added an extra onion. Wish I'd thought to add mushrooms! I liked this, but will probably stick with my usual method of cooking pot roast. Mom and daughter liked this VERY much, and split the leftovers, leaving me with none! I served it with a cucumber and onion salad, mashed sweet potatoes, and roasted brussels sprouts and cauliflower. A very enjoyable Sunday lunch!",

I made sandwiches with provolone and a nice sub bun. Good flavor but lacking some extra zip in there for me. I added a little worcestershire some more garlic powder and a little shake of hot sauce. Really easy recipe though and the more onions the better! Thanks for the recipe.",
