To make into a main meal I added 1c cooked/cubed chicken breasts omitted the extra can of green chiles (used them all up last night) and the mexican corn. Also just used velveeta in place of the mexican cheese. I didn't have to bake as long as the recipe indicates but turned out excellent. My boyfriend really enjoyed! ONE NOTE: I think step 1 was written incorrectly the two cups of rice will never get to the appropriate texture with 4 cups of water...even boiling. For the first step in preparing the rice follow the directions on the box.",

Also I added a can of drained black beans for protein so I could make this a one-dish meal. I ate this plain but the hubs wrapped into soft tortillas and made burritos out of them.
