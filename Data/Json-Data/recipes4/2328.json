I have been making a similar recipe to this for years (you can use whatever seasonings you like) and I leave the skin on.  If you are having trouble making the cuts (and it is hard to do), simply hold a wooden spoon handle on the cutting board, next to the potato.  (The spoon handle should be on the cutting board on the side closest to you, with the potato laying lengthwise on the other side of the spoon handle, touching it).  As you slice through with your knife, the wooden spoon handle will keep you from cutting too deeply and you will get nice, even cuts.  The potato fans out a little with some help, but not a lot.  Good luck.",

An easy way to slice the potato without cutting all the way down is to put a metal skewer (such as you use for shish kabob) the long way through the potato about 1/4 inch up from the bottom then when you slice down your knife hits the skewer and it stops it. This works great for blooming onions too. It is almost impossible to fan the potato out so after cutting it I cooked it halfway then took it out proceeded with the recipe using my own herb blend of rosemary oregano and basil but finished it on the grill wrapped in foil - YUM.",

Next time I will change my seasoning blend I used (McCormick Salt-Free Herb & Garlic) though. It was too garlicy (no fault of the recipe of course) and we would have preferred not such a strong garlic taste. Timing was spot on for medium-large potatoes (all about the same size). But I agree with the reviewer who used EVOO AND butter as the butter began to burn. I will watch closely if pototoes are on the larger size. Will make these often trying various seasonings & with the EVOO AND Butter mix. Thank you for the great recipe!",
