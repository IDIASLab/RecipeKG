I'm sure fresh peppers/onions/celery would be better, but I used frozen seasoning mix to save time. I also used Tony Chachere's\u00ae Creole Seasoning in place of the salt/pepper for more Cajun flavor. One tasty addition that I would recommend: I added about a half cup of corn, which provided a bit of sweetness and a little crunch. I also placed a top crust on the pie, but then again, I like a lot of crust. Two forks up from us!",

I doubled my recipe as I was cooking for a pretty large group. I used the store bought pie crust. First sauted onions, bell peppers, celery in butter. Then added some chopped garlic. Then added diced tomatoes, cream of mushroom soup, evaporated milk, and Tony Chachere's seasoning along with garlic powder (and cajun seasoning will do). I let this all come to a medium boil and then added cornstarch to thicken. Placed all of the filling into  the buttered pie crusts and baked. It was amazing. Will be making this again.

Before I added the soup I added one tbsp. of Kary's Roux for that Cajun taste and a small amount of ketchup to the mixture. Black pepper and garlic to taste. As some other people have done I also covered the mixture with another pie shell. Too thicken I added a little water and a tablespoon of cornstach. If it thickens too much just add a tad more water. This pie was the best crawfish pie that I have ever tasted bar none. Just wish I would have had fresh crawfish from a crawfish boil instead of frozen from China. Thanks for the recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "While the recipe turned out a very tasty satisfying dish three areas need considering spicing liquid and technique: 1) The amount of cayenne pepper may be overpowering unless your guests like it really spicy. 2) The amount of liquid the recipe suggests (1 cup water) is too much and will produce a watery soupy outcome. I found a scant 2/3 cup sufficient liquid and substituted Chardonnay for the water. 3) You cannot mix 2 Tbsp flour in 1 cup liquid without getting lumps and lots of them. The proper way is to add the flour to the saut\u00e9-ed veggies mix it in thoroughly and continue to saut\u00e9 for about 60 to 90 seconds. This thickens the small amount of liquid in the pan and cooks the starchy taste out of the flour. Following that add the larger amount of liquid a little at a time allow to thicken add more and so on until you have the thickness desired. I did pre-bake the bottom crust for about 15 minutes to prevent the liquid from soaking in. I also did not use a top crust. If you do apply an egg yolk wash to the top about 10 minutes before done to create a nicely browned top.",
