I got the general recipe from a German friend of mine with an added twist of my own.  I have had so many raves about my turkey that everyone now comes to my house on Thanksgiving.  Definitely a crowd pleaser, there has never been left over turkey at my house. Thanks Evelyn :)",

I had to make my own Soul Food seasoning (via the help of another member)using: 2 T ground pepper, 2 T garlic powder, 2 T onion powder, 2 T chili powder, 1 t dried parsley, 1 T paprika, 1 T salt, 1 t ground thyme, 1 pinch cayenne pepper, and 1 t celery seed. I took the suggestion of another review and thickened the juices with a bit of flour, some sour cream, and a generous amount of black pepper to make a really good gravy.  My dad said this turkey was better than his mom's, and that's huge.",

I admit that I am not a big roasted turkey fan so I'm  always looking for new twist to spruce up a normally dry and tastless main course.  This recipe did just that. It was easy to do the night before and it was gorgeous when it came out of the oven.  I'm still getting phone calls for visitors about how moist and tasty the turkey was.  I was expecting that the salt in the bacon would be too much but it was totally neutralized.  I have never had a turkey fall off the bone will trying to carve it.  This recipe is worth 10 stars but I can only give 5.  P.S.  Soul Food seasoning...is the same thing as McCormick's Seasonal or Lawry's Season Salt.  I compared the labels.  Eat and be Merry!",

Once we stuffed the turkey with everything listed in the recipe we filled the cavity with a bottle of pinot grigio and poured the rest in the pan. We prepped the turkey with regular poultry seasoning instead of the soul food seasoning and initially baked the turkey breast down (upside down) for 4 hours basting and injecting with the wine and turkey drippings in the bottom of the pan. At the 4th hour we flipped the turkey added the bacon reduced heat to 300 and baked for 2 more hours. By far this was one of the most tender and flavorful turkeys I have ever eaten!!
