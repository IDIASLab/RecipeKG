To make the chicken more flavorful I made these changes and it was delicious: Per 3 chicken breasts I used a 5oz container of Greek yogurt and mixed these ingredients right in the container in addition to the ingredients in the recipe. Added 1/2 teaspoon of Cavender's Greek Seasoning 1/2 tsp garlic powder and a pinch of cayenne pepper (omitted the black pepper) to the yogurt marinade. I put the chicken in a ziploc bag and added the yogurt marinade and coated the chicken in the bag. The 5oz container of yogurt was the perfect amount of yogurt to cover 3 chicken breasts. I grilled it on the GF grill and then topped with the feta cheese and sliced kalamata olives before serving. The yogurt marinade made the chicken moist and tender and it was much more flavorful with the Greek seasoning. This is definitely a keeper.",
