I did change the MSG to pepper. The next time I made it I added more chili power and garlic. Just to add a little kick. Everyone loved it. I now make it at home. We like it over French Fries and Cheeseburgers. My son loves it and always wants me to make it instead of buying the sauce in a can. It is easy to make. I do add all the spices and onions to the ground beef when I brown it. Then I put it in the blender to make it fine. Even with the changes I still give this 5 stars because it is just as good without adding to the recipe",
