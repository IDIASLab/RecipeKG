I know people are sensitive to those of us who make changes but I felt my substitution of cheddar for the blue cheese was necessary as my husband is not a blue cheese lover. I thought it would be too much for him in addition to the blue cheese dressing and I had seen other recipes that used cheddar. I also added some spring onion after it was heated and thought that really added a nice flavor. One thing I noticed was that the hot sauce did not blend in well for me and there were places with pools of it. But it tasted great anyway. I will definitely make this again.",
