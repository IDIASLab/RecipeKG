I made this to go with some gingerbread pancakes and although the flavor was very complementary it didn't present itself well on the pancakes. This really is more of a \"sauce\" rather than a syrup IMHO. A little sweet for us (but that's personal taste) but definitely tasty. I can see serving this on a breakfast casserole topping ice cream etc. or as the recipe submitter mentioned dipping a hot popover in this would be divine. It certainly should kick start you into thinking Fall.",
