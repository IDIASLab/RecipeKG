This isn't fair. If you didn't use any honey and substituted more mustard in place of it, of course it tasted odd and way too mustardy. You didn't follow the recipe.

Even though it looked amazing this is possibly the WORST recipe I have ever used for salmon. Don't bother wasting your ingredients. It is bland bland bland. I used an expensive salmon fillet which was more or less wasted and great pecans that could have been put to better use. Next time I will stick to my tried and tested recipe: a 1/4 cup white wine, some freshly squeezed lemon juice, salmon steaks or fillets, 1 tsp dried basil and 1 tsp dried oregano and freshly minced garlic, salt & pepper to taste. Cover and poach it for about 15 minutes top with a splash of extra virgin olive oil and it's the tastiest salmon you'll ever eat.",

It isn't the least bit bland, but if you like more spice you can easily add a bit of cayenne or red pepper to taste. My family and I have been enjoying this recipe for years. I do use cornbread crumbs instead of breadcrumbs when I have them on hand -- just freeze a piece of cornbread if you have any left over, or use those new cornbread crackers I've seen in the grocery store. Serve with a sweet corn and black bean salad, fresh buttered green beans and chocolate pudding cake with vanilla ice cream and you have a stellar meal.",

Instead I spread the honey butter dijon sauce on rather thickly by letting the butter sauce start to harden up a bit before brushing it on. For the bread crumb topping, I put the pecans in a zip lock baggy and pounded them with a rolling pin until they were sort of the consistency of rough ground coffee and I chopped the parsley pretty fine too. Then I used the topping generously but not excessively. Very flavorful. Very easy to make. A definite keeper.",

I've cooked a lot of salmon and this is one great recipe. It was absolutely delicious and very simple to make. Instead of breadcrumbs I used crushed bruschetta, although any sort of crackers would work quite nicely. I used a 1/2 cup of butter since I love saucey sauces. I skipped the nuts since I didn't have any on hand - tastes just fine without them. Instead of fresh parsley I used 1 teaspoon dried. I loved having extra sauce and I served it at the table so people could help themselves. Yum!!!!",

I have been making a variation of this recipe for years (just the honey & dijon by itself with a little salt & pepper baked - a little healthier without the crumbs and nuts for those watching carbs) and it the compliment of the honey/dijon with the salmon is outstanding!  That said, I think the people that didn't like this recipe are looking for more of a salmon-y taste.  This recipe balances out the extreme fishiness of salmon (a turn-off for many people, myself included) and, while extremely delicious for those of use that appreciate it, it can definitely be a disappointment if you are looking for a real salmon-y flavor.  If that is what you are interested in, stick with the normal white wine & lemon recipe.  If you love milder fish and dislike the real fishy taste of salmon, this is DEFINITELY the recipe for you!",
