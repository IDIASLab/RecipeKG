That makes a big difference so I stick to provolone everytime I make it. Don't let all the spices keep you from tying it because it is well worth it and a tip for buying spices is look in the mexican food isle in grocery for little packages of all the spices needed. They are alot less expensive than some other brand names. So it's affordable on ones budget. Almost a 5 with my boys.",

Sirloin tip roast works great...just partially freeze and slice into fajita-size strips, mix with the seasoning and prepare as directed.  Perfect blend of spices!
