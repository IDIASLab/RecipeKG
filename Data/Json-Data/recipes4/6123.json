For starters I added onion, green pepper, minced garlic, chicken and olive oil to the pan and cooked for about 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, I drained the great northern beans ( I was afraid of soup like consistency instead of hearty chili) and corn. I also used Swanson's Mexican Tortilla Flavor Infused Broth ( includes flavors of monterey jack cheese, lime, cayenne pepper, cumin, toasted corn, jalapeno, and paprika). I put all ingredients into a crockpot and cooked on high for 2 hours. Once done I added just enough heavy whipping cream to give it that cream like texture without overbearing the rest of the flavors. I saved the sour cream for the side because my son dislikes sour cream. It is delicious with and without sour cream. I topped with cilantro, a sprinkle of monterey jack cheese, and served lime flavored tortillas on the side. This is my husbands new favorite chili recipe and mine as well. Thanks for a great recipe!",

I also mixed in a 1/2 lb of spicy chicken Italian sausage to add a little more flavor. I saw another poster who suggested adding a green bell pepper, so I substituted that for one of the cans of green chilis. And I added a bag of frozen white corn too because I love chunky chili, and I subbed chipotle pepper for the cayenne just to add a little more smokey flavor. And since I like my chili a little thicker than the consistency of the original recipe, I let the meat mixture simmer in my crock pot for about an hour and then added the corn, beans, milk, sour cream, and about 4 tablespoons of cornstarch and let it simmer for another 30 minutes or so. It thickened up perfectly. I served with a pan of homemade buttermilk cornbread...and this dinner was super yummy for me and my hubby! Perfect way to ring in the fall. :)",

I will let it boil down a little next time and puree a couple cans of the beans with some broth. Needs some tweaking for our tastes.",
