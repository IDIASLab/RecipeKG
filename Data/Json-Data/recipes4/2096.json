This doesn't make a whole lot of sauce, and while it was perfect for hubby and me, if you serve this with pasta and like LOTS of sauce, you might want to double the sauce ingredients. I prepared this nearly exactly as written, finding only that I needed to add a little extra wine to the pan to deglaze once it came out of the oven. Also, I did not use jarred green olives, but a fresh, deli olive mix which gave this a truly unique and authentic \"Napoli\" flavor. In addition, this is a dish to impress, perfect for company, that pleases the eye as well as the palate. Hubby is a man of few words, but I know what \"make this again\" means!  ",

I took the pork out when it reached 150 degrees, sliced it into thick medallions and added the meat to the sauce to finish cooking. This kept the pork very juicy and allowed it to absorb the flavors. Served it on a bed of angel hair pasta (which is why the extra sauce was needed). I arranged the pork medallions on the pasta and poured the sauce on top. Will make this again.",

I did find that I had to add quite a bit more wine as the pork cooked, as the pan really dried out.   I could see even skipping the pork and using the sauce over pasta as a main dish for my vegetarian guests.  THANK YOU!!",

I had to substitute canned diced tomatoes which I drained a bit (it is winter and tomatoes in NJ are horrid!). Since there were only two of us I only used 1 tenderloin but used the ingredients for two. I am glad we did - there was nothing left! I served it with a butter and herb rice from Rice Roni. I will make this again (quick and great for company). I now know to double the sauce ingredients when I cook two tenderloins. Thanks so much submitter!!!",

Tinned tomato added some mushrooms and used light evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and it was great.
