I used packaged chicken breast (boneless skinless organic from Costco) and substituted the butter for coconut oil (a lot like crisco, it is solid at room temp and handles heat very well) I also left out the cheese (dairy is not paleo) pounded the breasts out, and layered ham in between the two layers of chicken (added in spinach too for a nice touch) topped with the crumbles and baked until the chicken was cooked through. Served a family of 3 with no leftovers and no guilt! Paired it with mashed cauliflower or steamed veg. Great dinner or even lunch! It's great cold too (if you have any leftovers ;-)",
