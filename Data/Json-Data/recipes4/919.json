I added some red bell pepper, I used beef and sweet italian sausage. I was a little leary about the rosemary in this sauce, but what ever you do do not leave it out.(oh my god wonderful). Also use fresh rosemary, I used more garlic than call for ofcourse!!. I added basil and Italian seasoning to the meat mixture while cooking. After I added the sauce I added some red wine (a must). Also I added a teaspoon of sugar. Now I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, I used a Italian penne pasta (Imported kind found in supermarket). I was also not to sure about the sour cream I do not like it at all, but I used it. Also do not leave it out made a big difference. I layered mine and baked covered for 35 min then uncovered for 10 min more. I served with garlic bread and a soft white wine. HEAVEN!!!.",

                "reviewBody": "Good stuff! This is a really strong recipe at its core. I would just modify some of the basic elements...especially step no. 4. Here are the recommendtions I would make to give this recipe a five star rating:\n1. Mix the sour cream, cottage cheese, mozzarella and parmesan together in a bowl. 2. Mix the pasta into the meat sauce. After spraying the casserole dish with non-stick spray, layer half the pasta/meat sauce in the dish. Spread the cheese mix on top of the bottom layer. Layer the rest of the pasta/meat sauce on top. Finish the casserole by placing the six slices of Provolone cheese and then bake. Twenty minutes at 350 was perfect. \n\nOther changes I made: I used 28 ounces of home made tomato sauce. The recipe was not specific enough for me - it said, \"1 1/2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce\" ...So is that 26 ounces total? Or is it 39 ounces? Another change I made is I used a pound of ground beef since I did not have the pork sauage on hand. I think the sausage would make it even better. Anyway, this recipe will fullfil a lasagna craving with half the effort.",

Put a small layer of sauce in the bottom of the pan, threw in half the ziti mixture, then the provolone, then the rest of the ziti. I have been making lasagna for years, and think from now on I will use this recipe....much easier to prepare.  Was a bit leary of the sour cream, but texture was wonderful.

                "reviewBody": "Mine turned out DELICIOUS. This was a great basic recipe. I made several additions/changes: I used ground beef and ground sweet Italian turkey sausage removed from the casings. To the beef mixture I added a pinch of dried rosemary dried oregano dried basil and some red pepper flakes. For the cheese mixture I didn't have sour cream so I used softened 8 oz. cream cheese mixed with 8 oz. of ricotta cheese mixed with 3/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese. After the sauce mix was done I added about half of it to the cooked ziti which I stopped boiling one minute before al dente. Barilla's ziti which I used is 10 mins to al dente but I cooked it for 9 mins. It was perfect for the baked dish. Okay so with half the sauce and beef mixed in with the pasta I layered the pasta with sauce mix in a 9 x 13 pan then placed the layer of provolone cheese on top of that. I then spread the cream cheese/ricotta mix on top of the provolone slices then the rest of the pasta and sauce mix. After that I poured the rest of the marinara/beef mix on it evenly. I had a bit of the cream cheese/ricotta mix left so I dotted it on top of the last layer of sauce then finished with a layer of mozzarella. I baked it at 400 F for 20 minutes until the mozzarella was brown. It was a tasty meal. I think I prefer it over lasagna. My fianc\u00e9 loved it and ate two huge helpings. I only had one serving because my thighs are huge enough.",

The only thing I'd do differently next time is I'd cut down on the amount of mozarella and provolone cheese - a little too much for my liking.

Browned the onion with the meat and the garlic, used 2 jars Barilla's Boscaiola Sauce (Mushroom and Garlic) and added 1 and 1/2 tsp. dried rosemary to the sauce. Mixed the sour cream (1/2 cup) with the ricotta (15 oz.) and the mozzarella (8 oz.) and parm along with 1 tsp. dried basil and a bit of S & P. I also added an egg to the cheese mixture. Layered some SAUCE FIRST, 1/2 pasta mixed with cheese, 1/2 provalone, more sauce, and repeated, topped with alot more sauce. You might need to open an extra jar. I needed a bit more, but I did use extra cheese.\nGreat pot luck dish. I have used Barilla's Arrabiata Sauce in this as well, and it's really good, too. Tastes even better leftover. Thanks, Seth!",

                "reviewBody": "I doubled the recipe but did not necessarily double all of the ingredients. Definitely altered it a bit. I used about 1 1/2lb of ground sirloin which I mixed with garlic rosemary basil oregano and fresh parsley. Also par boiled 1lb of mild Italian sausage and then cut each link in half and then quarters which I then added to the sirloin mixture. I also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. Mixed the ricotta (15 oz) with about 8 oz of sour cream and 10oz of frozen chopped spinach (make sure it is thawed and all the water squeezed out). Very yummy! I did not use all of the cheese it calls for mostly mozzarella but cut down on the amount of provolone. Did not layer just threw everything into a roaster (much better and easier to mix) and mixed all together. I did put about 1 inch of water on the bottom of roaster along with spraying Pam so there was no sticking. Since I am 100% Italian I made my own sauce and really used a ton of it (probably equivalent to 3 jars of store bought). Sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top. Since I doubled I had to bake longer about 50 minutes. Finishing touch was freshly grated parmesan cheese. Wow! What a hit. Everyone had seconds. Definitely will make again and again!",
