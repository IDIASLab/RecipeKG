I read the other reviews about it being too dry, and made some changes first--so I can't comment on what the actual recipe tastes like.  I sauteed 8 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms and one chopped onion in 4 tablespoons of butter.  I seasoned this mixture with garlic salt, salt, and pepper.  I added two cans of cream of mushroom soup, and two cups of sour cream to give it a creamier consistency.  I also seasoned the turkey with seasoning salt, garlic salt, and pepper.  I combined all of the ingredients, and added about one cup of cheddar cheese.  I also reduced the temperature because it seemed a little high.  I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes and it came out very good.",

However, I had to use up a ton of dryed out leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and my boyfriend likes hamburger helper style meals so I figured I would try this out.  Yum!  And it was so easy.  I did saute half a large onion and a couple cloves of garlic before adding the mushroom, and I added a splash of milk to the sauce because it looked pretty thick, but other than that I did everything by the recipe.  I will definitely make this again and for anyone who can't decide whether or not to make this, give it a try!  You may be surprised like I was.  I think next time I will add some steamed broccoli and fresh mushrooms to this.  You can customize it any way you want to.",

Based on the previous reviews I revised the recipe ever so slightly.:) In a nutshell I used regular pasta since I was out of egg noodles. It worked fine. Secondly I added some leftover whipping cream instead of water to counteract the dryness that some reviewers mentioned. Last I added leftover peas (a three pea dish with pearl onions) instead of using the mushrooms. Next time I think I would mix part of the cheese with the turkey mixture instead of putting it all on top but all in all this recipe was a hit (even with my ever finicky 4 year old). One last thing worth mentioning: if you like a lot of spice in your food add some garlic and a couple of tsps of all purpose seasoning/cuming/spice of your choice to complement the veggie used.",
