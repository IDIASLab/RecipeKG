Serve soupy with warm flour tortillas or crusty bread, crumble corn bread on top, or scoop up with tortilla chips. Like mac and cheese, it's a great comfort food. It is easy to make because it doesn't require constant attention and is good for everything from a family meal to a football party. It can easily be doubled. Check flavor before serving and alter seasonings to taste if necessary. Top with more onion and cilantro as desired. If there are any leftovers, they hold up well and taste great the next day.",

The beans, tomatoes, and ham all are cooked, and I found about 15-20 minutes was plenty of time.  Thanks, Nancy, this was a nice side dish.",

I make a pot almost every week and they may be eaten refried alongside eggs in the morning (wonderful!!!) taken in small containers along with a tortilla at lunch or eaten with tri-tip for dinner. I'm sure they can be jazzed up a little or substitutions made in the ingredients but they are yummy just the way the recipe is written.",
