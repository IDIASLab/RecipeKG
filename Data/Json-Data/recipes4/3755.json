I didn't boil the cauliflower quite as long as suggested because I didn't want to end up with a mushy dish.  I also fried it longer in the pan with the bread crumbs, butter, and onions.  This not only helped the bread crumbs to stay crunchy but the extra frying time added more flavor to the cauliflower.   Overall it was a very yummy dish and I would also give it a 4.5 if I could.  We will definitely make it again!",

The end result was super yummy I had 3 helpings! One thing that I would like to note is that there was no bubbling mixture after I added in the bread crumbs they completely absorbed the butter. And then they stuck to the cauliflower fairly well. There was quite a bit of extra bread crumbs in the bottom of the pan that I just couldn't get to stick. That was fine with me they still got eaten. And I would like to point out to the people that complained that this was mushy it is not the recipes fault that you over-boiled your cauliflower and then added more butter than the recipe called for. I imagine that would turn out mushy.",
