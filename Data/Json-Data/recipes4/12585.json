        "description": "One big centerpiece dish that is perfect for a fall or winter buffet is cassoulet, a hearty French stew of beans, lamb or pork, sausages and roast duck breast (rather than the traditional labor-intensive duck confit). You can even substitute boneless chicken thighs or pre-roasted duck (check Asian markets or restaurants and food warehouses, and remove the skin and bones). All the meats are in bite-sized chunks--ideal when you're balancing a plate on your lap. On the side, all this substantial dish needs is a green salad and bread. While classic cassoulet is an investment of two to three days of labor, my version offers wonderful variety without the extreme time commitment. The recipe may look long, but I've made it--from start to finish, and in double this quantity--the very afternoon",

I had to make a few changes due to neccessatity: use pork shoulder instead of lamb because it is hard to find here, and used chicken thighs with skin-on for the duck.  If brine the chicken thighs prior to cooking them, they develop a flavor similar to duck confit.  And I have found the flavor is best if you let everything sit overnight and do the last baking the next day.  Is this the same as cassuolet a French restaurant?  No, but it is doable at home and captures all the great flavors without slaving for 3+ days.",

I omit proscuitto because I just don't believe it's necessary if you have good quality sausages plus I don't like to take away from the succulent texture and flavour the duck fat gives the casserole by crossing cutting it with this type of ham but each to their own tastes. I also occasionally add rosemary and a bay leaf but not always and thyme does just as well alone. I don't know why this one is titled simplified cassoulet as it is very close in ingredients to the traditional which is a long list although the timing is much less. Yet it is all well worth the effort involved. I think it is also a very enjoyable dish to make layering your ingredients and simmering it to perfection savouring the wonderful scent it makes as it cooks.",

I followed the recipe almost exactly and adapted a few hints by the reviewers. What I found that worked was to put the whole thing together the night before and then let it sit. Complete the last baking step right before serving. I used a pork roast instead of lamb chicken instead of duck and omitted the proscuitto. My rural grocery stores don't have exotic ingredients like these too often. The pork was well-received but the chicken seemed a little too dry. I am personally a vegetarian cooking for carnivores so next time we will omit maybe the Italian sausages and add zucchini and squash just to even things out a bit. The meat gives the vegetables an excellent flavor. Delicious delicious delicious!",
