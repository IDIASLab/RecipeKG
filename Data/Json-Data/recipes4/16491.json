Just one scoop of mixture and roll it up, careful not to over fill. If you have time to cook a corned beef ahead of time it is best, say in the crock pot while your at work. Shave deli corned beef is also good, but I like to give it an added chopping (helps with mixing). I prefer using shredded swiss cheese, it taste great and makes mixing everything together easy. This is a great recipe, enjoy.",
