I don't usually have canned French onion soup on hand so my intent was to use a Lipton soup packet. Turns out I was out of that too so I had to make my own (2T 2tsp dried minced onion; 1tsp onion powder; 4 beef bouillon cubes; 1/4tsp celery salt). I tried this recipe with brown rice (cooking for 50 minutes instead of 25) and only used 2 cups of water due to other reviewers suggestions. This will definitely be made again in this household only next time I'll try the full amount of liquid as my rice came out a little crunchy (that's the brown rice talking though).",

Pepper makes it more tasty!",

Has a wonderful texture and flavor. Served this with marinated chicken kabobs from this website. Fabulous!",
