It could be a little crisper on the bottom and I'll add more salt next time but other than that it's the closest I've found to gluten pizza dough in terms of texture. I used a 9 x 13 glass baking dish and it didn't quite fill the bottom but this recipe is easy enough to adjust. I baked the loaded pizza on a cookie sheet but next time I'll try it directly on the rack to see if that gives it a crisper bottom.",
