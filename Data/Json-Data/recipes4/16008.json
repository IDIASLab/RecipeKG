I'm gonna use chopped onion, bell pepper and minced garlic while browning the rice and replace the tomatoes for a can of Rotel.  The Cilantro is an absolute must have for this recipe!

I'm gonna accompany it with Black Beans flavored with onion and Andouille sausage and some beef and cheese Quesadillas with homemade salsa.  Should be a great supper!",
