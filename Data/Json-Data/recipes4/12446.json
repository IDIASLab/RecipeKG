I made quite a few modifications because I made it impromptu. For the sauce I did not have miso or sake. I added rice wine vinegar instead of the sake (not quite 1/4 cup) and extra lime. I think that the cakes are good on their own--better without the sauce--or maybe just a little lime/butter sauce would be good. I amended the cakes as well since the proportion seemed off. I used a whole can of salmon (14 oz) and less bread crumbs--maybe 1 cup max? I had to use 2 eggs to get them moist enough. I added a bit of lime juice as well. My 7 year old complained that there were too many onions so I'd chop them more finely next time.",

Salmon cakes came out good texture and the sauce with it was yummm. I made my own chinese fried rice to go with it and it was really tasty my hubby just ate up the whole dish! It came out to be about 7 salmon cakes.:)",

The sauce would be good with sushi as well. As for the salmon cakes they left something to be desired but the overall flavor with the sauce was good. I would like to know if someone has a better basic \"cake\" recipe because it was a bit bland. There was too much bread crumb to the rest. But I assume if we decreased the bread crumbs the patties would fall apart. I don't know... I will definitely make this again. I will probably try some variations to the patty next time.

Very simple recipe for salmon cakes and the sauce was just flavorful enough to complement without killing the taste of the salmon. I often make salmon cakes and get crazy with the ingredients trying to spice things up but this is a great recipe that lets you enjoy the simple goodness that is a salmon cake. I served this with steamed baby bok choy and the Vietnamese Rice-Noodle Salad recipe from this site (substituting hoisin sauce for the fish sauce and adding a tbsp of rice vinegar). Everything went together very well. Will definitely add this to my permanent recipe book. Thanks for sending it in. Oh the sauce made a lot more than I needed for the 6 salmon cakes I got out of the recipe so I might try it as a pasta sauce tomorrow.",
