I used my crock pot and then after the potatoes were soft combined all the ingredients (including sour cream and tomatoes) and then blended everything together to make it easier for me Thanksgiving day.  I used only about 1 Tbsp of peanut butter and added 1/4 cup coconut milk.  It was amazing!  I received so many compliments and now no one wants the traditional Sweet Potato Casserole for Thanksgivig again.",

The flavors blend well and gave it a Thai sort of flavor what with the lime ginger red pepper peanut butter etc. I followed the recipe exactly although I had to substitute ground ginger in place of the gingerroot (1 tsp was about right) and bottled lime juice for the fresh. The toppings really made it special - especially the fresh tomato! My kids turned up their noses but I wasn't expecting any different; my husband and I loved this. Will make again!",
