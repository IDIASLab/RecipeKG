        "description": "We had a Chinese restaurant that made two soups that I loved how they tasted. When they went out of business, we looked for someone else that made these two soups, without much luck. Knowing all the ingredients that were there, I went to work to make my own recipe for this very tasty soup. Plus I'm a big fan of 'make it tasty, fast and easy' which this is, when I run the veggies through my food processor. Also when I not feel well, this is one soup that has all what help me feel better.  I also serve this with steamed rice as a side dish for those who want it as well.",

Ok, only had 1 very large chicken breast to use up, used 6 boullion cubes to 8 cups water, doubled ginger and garlic, used 2 tablespoons soy, left sesame oil the same. For the vegetables I used 1 large can baby corn,  8 oz can water chestnuts, cup of broccoli florets, cup shredded cabbage, 1/2 red pepper, 5 green onions, 1 medium zucchini and a small can of mushrooms. Some sprinkling of salt and pepper after simmering for a while and it was really delicious! Even my husband ate a big bowl and he hates soup.",
