Like the previous reviewer said, it doesn't lack flavor!  I used crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy and it tasted fine.  I would use less ginger and add some cayenne pepper.  I think adding saut\u00e9ed onions before cooking the chicken would be yummy. Next time I would  add some veggies while simmering, like bell peppers, carrots, etc.  It's a good recipe and kind of reminded me of a thai curry without the added fat of coconut milk. I would definitely make it again.",

I always put in double the curry 'cause we love it and it is served over vermicelli noodles. VERY delicious dish.",
