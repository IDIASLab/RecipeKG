Along with the snow peas I added diced green and red pepper purple onion mushrooms and bok choy. I also added some low sodium tamari sauce while I was frying the rice...I couldn't help myself. Because I wasn't sure how my shrimp-loving toddler would like the sauce I left it off completely and served it on the side. The sauce was super delicious but was almost bitter. I ended up adding a good teaspoon more honey. Next time I'll use freshly squeezed orange juice rather than the pasturized stuff to cut down on the tang. A great addition to our clean-out-the-veggie-bin Friday night stir fry. Thank you!",

I put a little peanut oil in the frying pan and quickly cook the cold brown rice with a little green onion. I then scramble 2 eggs off the side of the pan and incorporate this in the rice dish.
