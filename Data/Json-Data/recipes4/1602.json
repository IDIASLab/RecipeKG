The only thing I did different was I added 3 minced garlic with the onions ( I love garlic) and I added mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese (cause that's all I had on hand).. I think I will use cheddar next time.. I also noticed the potatoes tasted better if you let them sit for a few min. when they come out of the oven before serving them. I also made a side salad to go along with the potatoes.",

Baked this at 350 while I browned my meat and onions. I used 1 can cream of chicken soup and about 3/4 can of water. I added some Worcestershire sauce to the mixture. I also used about 1 tsp. of the garlic powder. Combined with the ground beef then poured over top of the potatoes and topped with cheese baked for about 15 more min. It was very tasty!
