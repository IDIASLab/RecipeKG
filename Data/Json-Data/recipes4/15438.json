I have NEVER had round steak that was so tender.  Usually it's very tough.  This was so tender that I honestly cut the meat with my fork.  Unbelievable. Thank you for adding steps on how to use the mallet.  I've used a mallet before, but didn't know how to use it properly.  I tweaked the recipe just a little bit.  I halved the recipe because only two were eating.  I used a can of stewed tomatoes in place of regular tomatoes just because I think I had it that way before and I liked it.  It was great! I also cut up a medium to small onion into bite size pieces (not chopped), and for good measure I tossed a little onion powder in as well. I also cut the pepper in bite size pieces (and used just a tiny bit more than the recipe called for).  Like another reviewer wrote, I will double the sauce next time.  My gosh this was good!  I don't remember when I cooked a better meal. Seriously.  I served it with mashed potatoes.  SO, SO GOOD!! It will surely be a regular at our house. Try it - you'll like it.  Thank you so much for sharing.",

The sauce was a bit soupy but that happens in a pressure cooker and can easily be cooked down to a more sauce-like consistency by reducing under head after you take the lid off the pressure cooker.  Very reminiscent of what my  mother used to make.   Great served with green beans and mashed potatoes, and a super way to use a cheaper cut of meat and have it taste like a million bucks.",
