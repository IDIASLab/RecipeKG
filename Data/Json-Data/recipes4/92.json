They only took about 40 minutes to cook. I was out of oregano, so I just stuck with the olive oil, salt and pepper, but I added 2 garlic cloves (crushed), and half of a yellow onion, diced. OMG was it good! Thanks for the recipe. I've never done sweet potatoes like this, so I'm very glad I found this recipe.  ***Update*** I made these with some cheddar cheese sprinkled on top for the last 15 minutes or so. So yummy!",

I turned them a few times during baking and they were done in about 45 minutes. Excellent with grilled pork tenderloin.",
