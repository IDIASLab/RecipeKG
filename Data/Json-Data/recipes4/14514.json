I was a bit hesitant to try something with cottage cheese vs. ricotta and a white sauce with chicken bullion/milk mixture instead of all milk and the cream cheese though sounds great didn't work. It had an ok flavor. Next time I will do the standard white sauce with parmesan and not cream cheese and do a traditional ricotta cheese filling. The zucchini concept is great carrots are always wonderful too and if one isn't crazy about zucchini you could easily substitute that with spinach.",

I bet it would be even better with richer cheeses in it but I was trying to cut some of the calories. I very much liked this recipe it was different from other vegetable lasagnas I have made. The best part is my veggie-disliking hubby said this was good. That makes it 5 stars in my book!",
