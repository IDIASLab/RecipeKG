I toasted the focaccia bread slightly then put my pesto sauce on one side and the mayo-mixed pesto sauce I happened to have from another recipe on top. I didn't have a red pepper so I used a green one. I sprinkled a little olive oil on top of the gr. pepper and a little black pepper and baked in my toaster oven for about 10 mins. I used tomato-basil feta cheese and the fresh basil leaves. Stupendous! Think it will be even better with a red pepper.",

I also skipped the mayo and used thin sliced sun dried tomatoes instead of sun dried tomato pesto. (On the other hand foccacia has a tendency to dry out so don't go over board!): ) I would definitely recommend trying goat cheese instead of feta. Goat cheese seems to compliment the flavors here better. I like feta better with some regular tomato red onion and cucumber for a healthier veggie alternative (untoasted if incl. cucumber). All in all great sandwich! I made a big one sliced into appetizer-size pieces for a tailgate and they were gone in a snap!",
