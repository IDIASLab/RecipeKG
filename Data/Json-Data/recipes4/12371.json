Secondly I just didn't get the chicken broth as the sauce. The parmesan cheese wasn't enough to thicken the sauce so I poured about 3/4 of the sauce over the pasta mixture tossed and served with a slotted spoon thereby draining most of the sauce back into the pan instead of on our plates. The kids loved it but I had so much left over \"sauce\" (broth) that I just tossed (wasted) it. I added the parmesan and some extra shredded cheddar-jack to attempt to thicken it. All in all it was very tasty but I need to figure out a healthy way to thicken the sauce and decrease the butter.",

I added onions browned the chicken by itself with salt pepper and garlic and then kind of stir fried all the veggies... I didn't use as much of the garlic probably 8 cloves worth instead of 12. I used some corn starch to thicken the \"sauce\" though it didn't thicken much but it's ok since I didn't use as much water therefore it coated the pasta without leaving a mess at the bottom. The cheese did not melt into the sauce it globbed together. I had to fish it out and then add Parmesan as a topping instead. I used the full amount of carrots but couldn't even fit the full amount of zucchini in the large deep skillet I had! That's a heck of a lot of veggies... I had to cook things in stages and add it to a humongous bowl afterward to toss everything together. Next time I will definitely halve the recipe. 5/6 people in my family liked it. I served this food with honey-yogurt berry salad and a green salad to make a filling but low fat meal.",
