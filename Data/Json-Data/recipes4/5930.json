We do not have crocks, so I just broiled the bread topped with cheese and placed it on top of the soup bowls before serving.",

Throw these veggies away keeping the liquid. The veggies have lost their unique favors after being cooked for several hours. From the strained liquid you can make a wonderful au jus with a couple tbls more wine. Our old friend Justin Wilson said never use a wine you would not drink. \"An' you don't get dat at da grocery store no.\" I use a good Marsala. Cook fresh veggies separately to serve with your meal.",
