The flavor is excellent just the way it is. Perfect! There is no such thing as too many peppers as the previous reviews stated. Good chili if spilled on the table should leave a burn mark in the wood. If for some reason you feel this is too hot you can always add a bit of sugar, this will eliminate some of the acidity hence taking a bit of heat from the chili. I don't recommend adding gobs of sugar or it will be too sweet. A bit of sweet ketchup or some baking soda will help too. This is our new family recipe from now on for chili. Thanks for posting it Edd! \nFYI, If you forget or do not wear gloves cutting the peppers your hands will burn, baking soda will help with this too. Take some hand soap and 3-4 tablespoons of baking soda and rub it in really good, let it sit on your hands a few minutes and rinse. Good as new!",

After sitting it also does not seem as hot so next time we plan to add a bit more bacon, another habanero and two more cans of beans. But the first time we followed the recipe exact and it turned out fantastic. If you did not think much of it after making it please try throwing it in the fridge and reheat it well the next day, its a whole new chili after that!\n\nI did cook longer as well, forgot to mention that. I cooked it for about 90 minutes then added bacon and beans. I had to run so I left it on low for about 3 hours after that. \n\nAlso, for gloves I had a box of surgical gloves and that works GREAT. They fit so well to your hands they do not get in the way and after chopping the peppers can just be thrown out. A whole box is only a couple bucks.",

If you don't like spicy food, obviously find a different recipe. If you do, it's fantastic. Great flavor from this chili, not just all burn and no taste. Two things: may not want to use 2 cups of water. It was a little too soupy for my tastes, I like my chili thick. I'd cut it to 1 cup. Also, make it ahead of time. I made it on Saturday and stuck it in the fridge until Monday. Flavors blend together quite nicely as it ages. It tasted much better Monday than it did Saturday.",
