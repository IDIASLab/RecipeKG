I used cubed red potatoes and sprayed them and the onions with olive oil before cooking.  I seasoned with dried rosemary, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I baked it at 400 degrees and it only took 40 minutes to cook! At serving time I sprinkled reduced fat Feta cheese on top!  Delicious!!",

I only cook with chicken breasts since my fianc\u00e9 and I are not big fans of dark meat so that is what I used. There are so many reasons why I love this recipe so... the first being that I only have to dirty 1 PAN ONLY while cooking!! OMG!! Another reason is that you can toss in whatever spices you feel like. I made my own seasoning mix which included some paprika garlic powder thyme basil oregano rosemary parsley salt and a little bit of black pepper. I also drizzled over some olive oil. I popped it in the oven for like an hour or so and the chicken came out super moist/juicy and the potatoes were fantastic. You can't really go wrong with the seasoning mix so you could pretty much just use whatever you have on hand. I used a little bit of everything and it seasoned the potatoes and meat perfectly.:) Highly recommend this!",
