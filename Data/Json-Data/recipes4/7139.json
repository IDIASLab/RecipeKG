Actually it yielded about 8 servings. I feed my family of four and it was about 2 servings a piece. I didn't have fire roasted tomatoes so I used regular diced tomatoes and was very pleased with the results. I can not wait to make this again. It is similar in texture to Wendy's chili. However I think this is better! Loved it!",

This was the first one I decided to make since we had about a week's-worth of Winter come through about a week ago.\nIt was so extremely amazing! The only thing I changed was that I used 80/20 ground beef in place of the turkey (I have a thing about ground turkey). It was the best chili I have ever made in my life! It wasn't so spicy that it left my lips blistered, but had a little kick with the tomatoes. \nI saved exactly half of it to freeze and my husband and I ate off off it for three days. The part that I froze is enough to invite my youngest daughter and her family (5 extra people)!!! I WILL be making this again. Extremely easy recipe, and extremely good!!!  \nI made some rice, had assorted grated cheeses, and good old-fashioned corn bread to go with it (the rice helps with young children who can't tolerate any spice--even though it's not a really spicy-hot chili). It's good all by itself, however!\nThank you so much for the recipe!!!",

However I added some coriander. That was awesome! I would recommend cilantro if you have it on hand coriander if you don't. I only had whole coriander so I crunched it up in a tea bag and floated it in the crockpot. The cilantro/coriander adds this lovely after taste and covers up some of the bean aftertaste. Also 1 cup or more of frozen corn - added in the last hour or so of cooking. I made it with beef and was a bit generous with the beef. Served with options of shredded cheese sour cream and hot sauce. It got rave reviews at a recent potluck.",
