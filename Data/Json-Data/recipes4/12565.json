With this recipe and day old rice, my grains of rice turned out fresh and didn't stick to the bottom of the pan or turn into a ball of mush, but it didn't really turn out 'fried' either. I didn't have any eggs in the house, so I skipped it. And I couldn't bring myself to put BBQ sauce in hoisin and soya sauce - I just couldn't wrap my mind around it - so I used oyster sauce instead. My recipe looked more like: equal parts hoisin and oyter sauce with a splash or two of soya sauce, 1 tsp of ground ginger and 1 tbsp of peanut butter. The resulting sauce I was quite happy with. I then fried the garlic up with onion and chicken, added green pepper and zucchini...and voil\u00e0. Despite the failure of the fried part of my rice, I quite liked the idea for the sauce this recipe gave me.",

Used mixed stir-fry vegetables and added some of last night's grilled chicken breast strips (marinated in Korean Marinade elsewhere on this site.) WOW! The only addition I made was to had about a quarter teaspoon of Vietnamese chili sauce making this dish a truely eclectic blend of Asian flavours! Marvelous will make this AGAIN AND AGAIN!
