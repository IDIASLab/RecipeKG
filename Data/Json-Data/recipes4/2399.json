I ended up eating the whole pound of beans in one shot.\n\nThree things that improve this, as far as I'm concerned:\n\n1)  Instead of boiling or steaming the green beans, toss them with a little olive oil so they get thinly coated, and then roast them on an aluminum foil covered sheet pan at 450F for 14 minutes.  The beans taste better this way, plus the dressing sticks to them a bit better.\n\n2)  Throw some red pepper flake and fresh ground black pepper in the dressing.  \n\n3)  Unless you're having some bread on the side, you can cut the amount of the liquid in the dressing by about 20%.  Also, since you're not cooking the oil/vinegar, use extra-virgin olive oil.",

The one thing we've changed is to only use half of the olive oil since we love the taste of the vinegar with the garlic and shallots and that much oil isn't really needed. This is perfect with Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken by Connie also on this site and oven roasted red potatoes.",
