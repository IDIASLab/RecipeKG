What I did: roasted the cauliflower with the garlic  and olive oil for 15 min at 425.  While that roasted, I browned the ground turkey then added the onion soup packet and about 1/2 cup of beef broth to moisten things. Put that in the bottom of a 9x11 dish, added frozen corn and green beans (what ever veggies you like will do) Salt and pepper. Then I took the roasted cauliflower  and Parmesan  Cheese and cream cheese and blended it in the food processor. Topped it onto the veggies and then topped that with some low fat cheddar cheese. Baked at 425 for 20 min, until cheese was melted and slightly browned. My family didn't realize there were no potatoes and you don't need the pasta!",

                "reviewBody": "OK. So I doubled the recipe on this one. I tend to cook in bulk. \n\nI am a huge fan of anything really onions and garlic. My changes to this recipe included: using a little purple onion (left overs) and 1 small yellow onion and 4 cloves of garlic (saut\u00e9ed) added to the cauliflower mix along with the parmesan and cream cheese. I threw in some butter and a sprinkle of Italian bread crumb mixture too! YUM!\n\nThen for the turkey ground I pre-made some bouillon cube mix. 2 cubes to be exact. \n\nI then cooked the ground turkey. Drained and brought back to the pot and added in mixed veggies (green beans, carrots, and peas), I threw in the bouillon cube mix and then used a can of french onion fried crisps. It all squished together and came out beautifully. I also gave it a sprinkle of Lawry seasoning and pepper. Even though I know there is salt in the crisps. \n\nI then layered the cauliflower then meat mixture incorporating some left over (very small amount) of mozzarella and layered the Colby and Monterey jack sprinkles between the meat and cauliflower with the \"mashed potatoes\" on top and sprinkle of cheese over. \n\nNot sure how this really happened as I have never made it before but it smells amazing and Im excited to see what my husband thinks. *pray for us! *side note....it's delicious! EXCEPT.... the meat is kinda wet now so we are going to add another 20 minutes to firm up a bit in the oven. Same temperatures and everything. *drool.",
