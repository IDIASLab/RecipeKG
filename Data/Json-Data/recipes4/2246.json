The butter should definitely be cut in at least half and I added a generous portion of curry powder which made it absolutely spectacular.

I baked chicken legs and boneless pork chops in a 9x13 with this poured over it and served with rice and steamed carrots. It was absolutely delicious.",

I only needed 2 chicken breasts so I cut the sauce in half and there was still a lot.  I'm not good about basting once the meat goes into the oven.  With a 3 year old, I want to \"set it and forget it\", so my sauce didn't glaze very well.  I still gave 5 stars because that was my own problem.  Next time, I will only pour half the sauce over the meat, and put the rest in a sauce pan, to thicken.  Then pour the sauce over the meat at the end.\n\nI served this with fresh green beans and squash-apple bake.  A great Fall meal.\n\nFast, easy and delicious!  You can't ask for more.  Next time, I'll try this with pork chops.  Should be great!",

I wanted to make six chicken breasts, so following the recommendations of others, I adjusted the recipe as follows:  1/4 cup butter; 1 cup honey; 1/2 cup mustard and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  It did make a lot of the sauce, but that was fine. (It worked out well for the six chicken breasts, and we like a lot of sauce!) Served it with rice and green beans.  The sauce also tasted good on the rice. I baked it at 375 for 45 minutes; worked out well for the six chicken breasts. I only basted once, and probably didn't even need to do that.  I will definitedly make this again.",
