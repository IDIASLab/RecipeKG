I did not know that the sandwich would cook on the bottom first. So, the first time I cooked them, I kept waiting for the top to turn golden brown, so the bottom burnt. The second time I flipped them when the bottom was cooked, and cooked the other side for the same amount of time. So, the bottom burned. The third time was a charm :-) I flipped when the bottom was done and checked the sandwiches after 2-3 additional minutes. Perfect!! The total cooking time is 6-8 minutes. If you cook the total time that the recipe says, you might end up with burned bread as I did. These are great. Can make many many at a time and they are not greasy. So, I am slow at learning, but these are great!! Thanks for the recipe!! I will repeat many times!!!",

We don't bake them as in this recipe, though -- we put them under the broiler.  If you do it this way, however, watch them closely because they cook _fast_.\r\n\r\nSome tips:\r\n\r\nWhere there is butter, the bread will take longer to cook.  This means, for best results, put the most butter around the crust and little to none in the middle.  Done that way, the crust won't burn before the sandwich is ready.\r\n\r\nAlso, if using a thick slice of cheese, or a pair of american singles, you might want to melt the cheese with the sandwich open-faced before closing it, buttering and baking/broiling as indicated.  I find that the cheese sometimes doesn't get melted completely otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have had grilled cheese sandwiches made the \"traditional\" way many times, though I grew up on them this way.  To me, there is no comparison; the oven gives a nice, crispy texture that I have been unable to duplicate any other way.",

I've always made grilled cheese in the frying pan...NO MORE! Although I love the gooiness of a grilled cheese sandwich, mine were always too gooey and floppy! This recipe makes a wonderful crunchy outside and a glorious gooey inside! Thank you so much!\r\nI did follow the other tips below and buttered the bread heavier on the edges and hardly at all in the middle.  This worked out perfect. I also only set the oven for 400 degrees, put the rack on the bottom position and baked for about 8 min on the first side and only 6 mins after flipping.\r\nTwo slices of American cheese was my choice for the sandwiches this time, but looking forward to adding other goodies such as tomato, ham, or even trying a tuna melt....Thanks for this idea!!!!\r\n",

                "reviewBody": "After reading the reviews and making this several times I've discovered a few things. The time it takes depends on the bread type (e.g. wheat white etc.) the bread slice thickness and the temperature of the cheese when it goes in the oven. White bread takes twice as long as wheat bread (with the same thickness) to brown. Cheese that is still at refrigerator temperature will not melt by the time the bread is browned. I've a feeling that the author used white bread and her cheese was at room temperature. For me it takes 5-6 minutes on each side for white bread and 3-4 minutes on each side for wheat bread. The best way I have found to make sure the cheese melts is to place a buttered slice of bread (buttered side down) on a cookie sheet top with cheese and bake for the first half of the time. Add a second slice of buttered bread on top of the cheese (buttered side up) then flip over and bake the remaining time. It turns out perfect every time for me now. Each oven will be slightly different too. Mine is only about 6 months old.",
