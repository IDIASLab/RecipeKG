I used less than called for and still it was the dominant flavor. I'm also not sure the honey is necessary. I made this with almond milk and it was thick and creamy. I also used fresh corn and subbed freshly roasted Hatch green chiles for the jalapeno which gave it more heat (I don't think it'd be very spicy with just the half jalapeno). If I were to make this again I'd roast the bell peppers for more flavor add more oregano omit the orange zest and add a bit of cumin.",

I used fat free milk instead of soy since we don't like it and used vegie stock in place of the wine. The orange zest did not bother me at all. My husband took some leftovers to work last night and said they were even better that way! Thanks for a great recipe!",

Heat/spice should really be the last and most memorable of the food as the individual experiences the taste character and hopefully the complexity of a thoughtfully layered dish. So here is what I did... I added heavy whipping cream to get the consistency of a chowder. This recipe uses cornstarch to thicken it and since it calls out for soy milk and not even a true cream you will need a lot more cornstarch than 3 tbs. So after using way more than 3 tbs I added dried potatoes... a little at a time adding more to reach your preferred taste and texture of course. I also added actual potatoes and celery to this recipe to add to the \"layering\" of the chowder. Lastly to give it the real depth and character of an amazing chowder I added chopped clams and the clam juice. AMAZING!!!!!!!",
