I ended up using 3 breasts & 3 leg/thigh pieces, & since I made potatoes for the kids I used potato water for the gravy, which turned out really good = the kids didn't think that I made it.

                "reviewBody": "This is a recipe that I make often, but it would benefit from a slight change in technique. Those of you that complain about the gravy should try this: Add a few TBS of butter to the pan when the chicken is done. Stir well to get all the bits off the bottom of the pan. Add the 2 TBS flour (or maybe 3) to make a roux, and let it bubble for a few minutes while you get all the lumps out. Then, pour in chicken broth, not water, and stir while it thickens. If it is too thick, add more broth. Let it cook on lower heat for a few minutes to cook the flour taste out of it. This is a more classic way to make gravy, and I think you'll like it better this way, as it cooks the flour better.",

As a cook and parent we all know our family and their preferences as far as seasoning and spices and when we respond with whatever rating to a recpie I feel in giving the recipe a rating in a sense we are paying respect to the originator of the recipe for their creation. To me it takes nothing from their creation to improvise and make it our own. In a way that is a tremendous compliment to them. That is just my feeling. I love this site and I LOVE all the diversity throughout. When people give their insight it helps me to \"make it my own\" without disrespecting the originator. Diversity is what makes the world go around. If no one took initiative to create or recreate the world would be boring. No disrespect intended to anyone just my thoughts.",
