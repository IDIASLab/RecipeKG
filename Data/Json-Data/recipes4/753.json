My curiosity was enough that I was determined to make it as written-which meant resisting the urge first of all to add fresh garlic. I was not disappointed. While adding garlic here would seem obvious I wanted something beyond the same ol' same ol'. This is simply wonderful--just as written. And as for the cooking method--it worked out perfectly and the beans were bright green fresh and with a just right taste of sesame from the oil and seeds. I think adding garlic as so many others have done would have totally negated the whole point of this dish and would have masked that delicate sesame flavor. Add it if you like but then these beans are still the same old green beans with garlic.",

And something to try if popping sesame seeds is too much of a hassle: toast them in a 350 deg oven for about 10-15 minutes instead of frying them. Less mess problem solved.",

I did add sesame oil in w/ the olive oil to add flavor...was fearful of the sesame oil burning if I had only used it. The 1/4 cup of broth evaporated away as soon as it hit the hot pan so I added more chicken broth (probably close to another half cup). I cooked the beans exactly 10 minutes & they were perfect! Still a bit crisp but yet tender. These were a great companion dish to Mahogany Wings (from this site).",
