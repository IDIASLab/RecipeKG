The can went in the fridge so the polenta would set. Once set the polenta slid out of the can easily and all I had to do was slice it. I also like to batter the polenta a bit so it's crusty and savory when it's pan fried. The extra texture really plays well with the shrimp and sauce. Great recipe!",

Otherwise I followed the directions exactly except my nuts were thrown out before I was able to get them into the sauce at the end. This was disappointing but they weren't missed. When I first tried the sauce I hated it. It seemed way too sweet to belong with this dish so I used more cream to mellow out the hazelnut taste. Whether I had done that or not I don't think it mattered in the end. The flavors of sweet and savory melded together perfectly and just a drizzle of the sauce was perfect. The dish also presents beautifully and was a huge hit.",

I cook a lot and often enjoy the things I make but rarely do I step back and think \"wow did I make that?\" This will become a family favorite for me. I live in Alaska just a little outside of of Anchorage so sometimes I have to substitute because ingredients arn't avaliable. But even with the substitutes it was great. I couldn't find hazelnuts on thier own so I got the mixed nutz from planters that had hazelnuts. I figured the liqure would set the taste you needs the nuts for texture and buttery flavor. Second I bought polenta already made in a tube form. I sliced it and sprayed with oilve oil then stuck it under the broiler for about 10 to 15 mins. Once they where hot and a little crisp I flipped them and put a dolp of cream cheese on top. I couldn't get marscapone...this was my other substitute:) I placed the pollenta back under the broiler and cooked it till the cheese browned. I found this made the presentation great. I served the with greem beans for a veggie it went well. Enjoy!!!!",

I also used packaged polenta so I can't comment on that recipe but the sauce and shrimp were good.",
