I removed about 1/3 of the bean mixture and put it in the blender and then put the blended mixture back in with the beans. This thickened the mixture and made it less soupy. We loved the flavor and I served it with some diced avocado on top. I love that this is completely vegan and tastes amazing. You don't miss the meat or cheese. The only thing I would change is to use half the salt. This recipe will go in the regular rotation. Quick easy and thrifty.",
