The tomato sauce can be used for anything and the amounts of flavors can be adjusted. I like a lot of garlic and pepper. I have also found halal hamburger to be much leaner and lighter than regular. You can find it at international food stores and halal butcher shops in bigger cities. Serve this dish with a French baguette.",

Sofrito adds a little zip and spice to the sauce, as I did not have ras el hanout. Simmer on low and added on top of the meatballs. It was SO good and my company for dinner that night were AMAZED!

I doubled up on the recipe, and it fed a hungry family of 4 with leftovers for a single lunch (in other words- it was devoured!). Beautiful recipe and very simple to make. Thank you for sharing your wonderful family dish and I will be adding this recipe as a staple menu item. Also, I made the ras el hanout. Very easy to make and requires readily available spices. I give this recipe 5 stars all around- looks nice, smells wonderful, tastes amazing, takes under an hour from start to finish (even with making the spice), but most of all- will be enjoyed by all sorts of eaters- from finicky to those that will eat anything.",
