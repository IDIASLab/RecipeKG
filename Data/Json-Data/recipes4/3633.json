Why spend $25 when you can do it at home? It's a really warm and filling dish that you won't be able to get enough of!  You can add tomatoes to it if you wish and adjust the garlic, hotness and oil to your liking. Enjoy! I serve this with Romano cheese and crushed red pepper.",

The main differences are the sausage wasn't used and after blanching the broccoli was sauted with the spices.  The Italian lady who taught me to make it used the same pot and water for boiling the pasta and blanching the broccoli.  Just blanch the broccoli first, scoop it out and cook the pasta.  She said it didn't add anything to the pasta but saved water and using two pots.  It has been the most requested recipe by my children when they leave home.",

I also didn't have onion salt or garlic powder so decided to use fresh (2tbsp 2 tsp of fresh onion and 4 1/8 tsp of garlic- in addition to the 2 garlic cloves it calls for.). In order to add a little sharpness I used a little pecorino at the end and chose black olives brined in salt from",
