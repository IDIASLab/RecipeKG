But I found the casserole almost too sweet. The other ingredients were not savory enough to contrast the sweetness. Perhaps cooking the rice in a chicken broth and adding spices might help with that.",

I also think more rice could be added to the dish as it seemed to get lost in 3# s of onions. But my DH and I did enjoy the simple taste of this dish. I ran the onions and the Swiss cheese through the food processor to help speed up the process. This dish makes A LOT if you make the full batch. My 2 qt. casserole dish must not have been deep enough as I had run-overs in the oven. Enough spillage that I m thankful for the self-cleaning feature on my oven. My parents also enjoyed this side dish. I re-purposed the leftovers into a breakfast casserole that I was making the next night. It worked great and added delicious flavor to Slow Cooker Western Omelet from AR. Thanks Bobbie for sharing your recipe I will be making it again.",
