After making the marinade as stated in the recipe, I thought that it was a bit bland for our liking so I added some ingredients.  To the marinade I added 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon light brown sugar, 1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce, 2 cloves chopped garlic and 2 teaspoons lime juice. I stirred it up, put in the chicken breasts (cut into strips), and let the marinating chicken sit in the refrigerator, in a covered bowl, for six hours. In the meantime I soaked the skewers in water so they wouldn't burn on our gas grill. After marinating for 6 hours, I put the meat on the skewers (ending up with 40 skewers), and grilled them in our gas grill, on medium high heat, on a piece of heavy duty foil (lightly sprayed with cooking spray). They came out golden brown as well as tender and juicy.  We served these with Thai curry rice, fresh string beans from the farmer's market and \"The Best Thai Peanut Sauce\" (also on this site - awesome 'as is'). The meal was a big hit...delicious! the reason I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the changes made to the recipe. I will definitely be making this recipe again.",

I only made a couple of modifications...I used soy sauce in place of the fish sauce as it's not something I keep around. I also didn't have chili oil so I used a pinch of red pepper flakes. I used chicken tenders and didn't skewer them...mine marinated for about 2 days (I trim meat and put it in marinade when I get home from the store and then freeze or refrigerate). I cooked my under the broiler for about 4 minutes per side. Very moist and tender and full of flavor. I didn't use the garnishes but there is cilantro in the peanut sauce I made. \"The Best Thai Peanut Sauce\"...see my reviews for notes on modifications I used for that recipe.",
