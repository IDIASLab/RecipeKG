I omit the cayenne and halve the amount of black pepper, then call it \"Kid Friendly Creole Seasoning.\" I keep a batch of this in my cabinet and use it in many things: steak on the grill, baked chicken, in soups and stews, while cooking ground turkey or ground beef; anytime a little kick is needed. I even used it on my Thanksgiving turkey.  Thanks for the recipe! Even my picky 6-yr old and 8-yr old kids eat this. Note: to reduce the salt, use Kosher salt; gives it a nice texture without as much salty taste.",

It worked great on the Oven-Fried Catfish recipe on this site.  I mixed two tsp seasoning and 1/3 cup ranch dressing for a dip for cauliflower. SO YUMMY!  Halving the recipe will make plenty to last a while. Fun to put together. Did look great as a mix. Add to mayo or ranch dressing for any kind of dip.  Perhaps it was just a bit salty tasting. Might do a pinch less next time.",

While Creole seasonings all have similar ingredients, the combinations and ratios do differ. I was never happy with the commercial blends so, through trial and error, I came up with a blend that has a good amount of heat while still allowing the flavors of the spices and herbs to come through. I\u2019m flattered that \u201cgumbopages.com\u201d has chosen my original recipe to post on their website, although they tweaked the recipe a bit by adding celery seed and omitting the salt. Creole recipes always start with a roux and \u201cThe Holy Trinity,\u201d which consists of approximately equal amounts of diced onion, diced celery, and diced bell pepper, so for me; I don\u2019t feel celery seed is needed in this blend. I realize some of you may be on salt restricted diets though, and you can certainly reduce the amount of salt, or omit it completely. Happy cooking!",

For my second time, I adjusted it slightly by only adding 1/3 of the salt (for my dad with hypertension) and replacing a generous \u00bd tablespoon of the paprika with crushed red pepper flakes. It got unspeakably incredible! Also, I mixed 2 tablespoons of the seasoning with equal parts olive oil and Sweet Baby Ray\u2019s original barbeque sauce plus a dash of brown sugar, mixed them and brushed the mixture over some beer brats on the grill. It was the most delicious barbequed dish I have ever tasted- bar none! My boyfriend also says it is equally delicious on ribs, chicken, Chex Mix and steak fries. Enjoy everyone!",
