I have used white, apple cider, red wine and balsamic vinegar individually and it's still awesome. So if you don't like a certain kind of vinegar you can easily use a different kind!!!!",

This is the most delicious chicken and I had every member of this family raving about it. We grilled the chicken breasts after pounding them only marinated about two hours. Tender cooked perfectly. I will only make chicken this way from now on. Went great with a bottle of cab because of the grilling and ranch flavors. Wow! I am going to go to bed dreaming about this one tonight. Definately one of the top recipes I have ever made from this site. And did I mention how easy it came together?",

Started with frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts. Poured the marinade over the breast while they were thawing in a covered corning ware dish. I pre boiled enough potatoes for hubby and myself. Preheated oven to 400 degrees F. Took the chicken out of the marinade and placed them on a cookie sheet and popped them into the oven. I then put the potatoes in the marinade to coat them well. When it was time to turn the chicken over I put the potatoes on the cookie sheet with the chicken. Turned the potatoes once to brown on the other side. The chicken and potatoes were excellent!! So quick and easy I can't wait to try this on different meats. Thank you so much. This will be a regular at our house.",
