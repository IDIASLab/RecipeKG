Here in Rhode Island, we have an abundance of clams, so I make this one often, using quahogs that my boys dig up.  \r\n\r\nMy one issue with this recipe, as-is, is that you have to make sure that the flour is adequately cooked, or you get that raw-flour taste.  In order to do this with the sautee-the-flour-with-the-potatoes method, you run the risk of making the potatoes a bit mushy.  If you have a bit more time, make a roux by melting a 1/2 stick of butter and cooking the flour in it for about 5 minutes.  Wisk the roux in with the dairy before proceeding with step 4. You'll have a creamy and nicely thickened chowder with no lumps!",

I was able to cut a lot of fat from the recipe with the following changes, and no loss of flavor: drain most of the bacon fat, there is still enough in the pan to cook the potato and onion. Use 2 cups of clam broth, and equal parts cream and skim milk until you get your desired thickness. I usually use more skim milk than cream. This may make the soup a little thinner, but I like it that way :) and its much healthier, so you can eat more and not feel guilty! Go ahead, have the 2nd bowl!",

I did make some alterations however. I found that the recipe called for too many potatoes for my taste so I used half the amount called for. I also doubled the flour (I like it to be a bit thicker). The recipe doesn't say if we are supposed to use the juice from the canned clams so I discard the juice from one can and use the other. and the final change that i like the best is that I put a half tsp of dried thyme in before I add the clam juice to the potatoes. My accolades to the cook a very well done recipe and definitely a keeper!",
