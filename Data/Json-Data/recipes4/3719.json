I had to almost double the broth to keep it a soup instead of a stew but I thought it turned out great! The flavors and spices mixed very nicely; makes a very good fall/winter soup. This recipe will definitely be made again although I don't know if I'm going to increase the amount of wine from 1/4 cup that I used to 1/2 cup that it calls for...
