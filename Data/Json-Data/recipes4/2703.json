I browned the beef and then threw everything into the slow cooker on low for four hours (I'm a huge fan of my slow cooker so I use it whenever possible). I added a good dash of Worcester sauce (love the stuff) about 1/4 cup of some leftover BBQ sauce (it NEEDED to be used somewhere) a dash of red pepper flakes a can of Hunt's diced spicy red peppers in place of the tomato sauce (didn't have any) omitted the salt and used rotini because I was out of shells. I only had Hormel real bacon pieces on hand so I added those to the slow cooker in the final 10 minutes of cooking. When the pasta was cooked I drained and rinsed it under cold water before I added it to the meat mixture in the slow cooker. The end result was fabulous; a hint of sweet from the BBQ sauce and a bit of heat from the red pepper flakes and tomatoes. Thanks Alle (sorry for all the modifications!)",
