I am an experienced cook but was looking for something really quick yet hearty to make with gnocchi. I came upon this recipe and decided it was perfect and instead of tweaking it like I usually do I actually decided to make it exactly as directed. I enjoy gnocchi cooked longer past actually being done so it's fluffier and this was the perfect vehicle to do that. I just made this tonight for my daughter and myself and we both thoroughly enjoyed it and finished every last drop!",

My husband is diabetic and the soup sent his blood sugar into orbit.  We couldn't understand why, so I did a little internet research.  Turns out that the longer vegetables are cooked, the more glucose they release.  I had simmered my soup for about an hour.  When I make this again, I will cook the vegetables separately and add them just before serving the soup.  Thank you for an easy and delicious recipe.",

Unless you have an idea of what to do with the remaining gnocchi I would up the servings to best fit the one pound of gnocchi you will need to buy.",
