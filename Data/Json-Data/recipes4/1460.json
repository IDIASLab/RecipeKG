I found the salt level to be pleasant but my husband felt it was a little too salty. I used buillon cubes so I'm sure that contributed to the saltiness. I added a few extra cubes to ensure the soup wasn't too weak and in hindsight I don't think that was necessary. I used Merlot instead of a white wine because that is what I had handy... also I added a splash of balsamic vinegar towards the end of cooking. I toasted the french bread slices before broiling and mixed in a little romano and fresh mozarella with the swiss. All in all very good. Our 11 year old asked for more soup instead of pizza. Don't be afraid to cook the onions for longer than stated. I made mine a nice golden brown - carmelized almost. I think that adds so much to the taste.",

The recipe called for paprika but I didn't see in the instructions whether to add it to the soup or if was meant to be a sprinkling over the cheese. Anyway I did both and it was great. I always add some sugar to my onions as they're browning which cuts down a little on the cooking time. Hubby's the FOS King and he and my family just loved it. Thanks so much!",

I had a problem when the dry ingredients were added and needed to cook 10 minutes. If I cooked the dry ingredients for 10 minutes they would have burnt. I also only could let the soup simmer on very low for 1.5 hours any more and I would not have had enough liquid left for it to be soup. The broth in this recipe was somewhat heavy and almost too rich from simmering so long. Sorry:(",
