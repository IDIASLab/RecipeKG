I had read a lot of the previous reviews and so decided to make some modifications to the recipe: I used almost 16 oz of frozen spinach and just a little more than half the cream cheese and sour cream. I also sauteed 2 heaping Teaspoons of crushed garlic in the butter before adding the spinach and artichokes to the saucepan. I added salt and lots of pepper. The dip turned out nice and chunky and had a lot of flavor - can anybody say 'garlic'???. I served it warm with some sliced french bread. This will be my new favorite!",

Many rate the recipe with 4 or 5 stars but go on to tell you how they basically reinvented the entire recipe so that it's unrecognizable to the original. That, my friends, does not a four star recipe make. Don't be fooled by the high star rating! I even added six cloves of garlic, onion powder and loads of salt and pepper. This dip leaves you with that annoying \"this needs something\" phrase hanging on the end of every bite. I don't know what it needs. Maybe onion? I planned to make this for Christmas as I'm hosting 25 for dinner and wanted something to set out for guests while I'm cooking. I'm SO glad I tried this in advance rather than be embarrassed serving to guests for the first time. I won't be making it again. Three stars is probably generous -- early Christmas present I guess.
