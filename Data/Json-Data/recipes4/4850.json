I use regular cream cheese instead of the soft when making a cheese ball & mix in the shredded cheddar-jack roll in a ball & chill & right before serving roll in crushed tortilla chips. It is great! I might try adding some bacon to the sandwich or spread next time I am sure that would be good also but these are delicious made exactly as the recipe states.",
