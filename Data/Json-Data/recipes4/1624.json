I prefer lower fat food, so instead of the sour cream I use 1/2 cup milk (any kind); I also use lowfat margarine instead of butter.  (My aunt's original recipe called for non-dairy coffee creamer in place of sour cream or milk, and non-dairy margarine, in order to make it kosher). And this is important: for a really nice texture, use farfalle (bowtie) noodles instead of other kinds, and don't use egg noodles. Even if you don't overcook them, it causes the kugel to be gloppy.",
