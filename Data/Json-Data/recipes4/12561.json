        "description": "I love banana empanadas and I wanted to see if I could make them.  This is what I came up with and I wanted to share.  They're pocket pies.  You can make them with other fresh fruits (peaches, apples, apricots, pears, etc.) or with canned fruit filling.  The good thing about bananas is that you don't have to add any sugar and the empanadas still taste great.  If you use other fresh fruits you may want to consider adding about 1 tablespoon of sugar to the inside of each pocket. You may also sprinkle them with cinnamon-sugar as soon as they come out of the oven.",

Drain the raisins, and mix with the cinnamon and chopped bananas. Spoon some of the banana mixture onto half of each square, leaving at least 1/2 inch of dough exposed at the edge to seal the edges. Fold the dough over the fruit, and pinch the edges together. Make sure that they are secure.  I like to roll the excess dough up around the edges and then pinch it until it's thin again.  You'll want to have about a 1/2 inch closure in the end.  You can trim the edges a bit to make them more aesthetically pleasing. Place empanadas on a baking sheet. Whisk together 1 tablespoon of cold water and egg white; brush over the tops.\n"
