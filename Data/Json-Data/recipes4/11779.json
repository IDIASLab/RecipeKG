I just threw all the ingredients into my tiger rice cooker and it came out great!!!!!! I added a pinch of Himalayan sea salt too. When it was done cooking It looked like there was an excessive about of water/can coconut milk but I stirred it and it was fine. I doubled the recipe for a big gathering we were going to. I just unplugged the rice cooker and took it with me and plugged it back in at our destination and kept it on warm. I used the leftover can of coconut milk and mixed it with COCO Re'al (located in the liquor section of your grocer) for a topping. You can make it as sweet as you like. I like mine less sweet. You can also use COCO Lopez if your grocer has it.",

I thought it needed to cook the whole 45 minutes to reduce the water. After it was cooked I added more sugar (probably w/the original 1/3 heaping 1/2c--but I like sweet). I also added and regretted adding just a bit of coconut extract. A couple pinches of salt did seem like a good addition and made it taste more like a black rice pudding I got in a restaurant once. The dessert is very rich--which is tasty but I'd be curious to try making it with light coconut milk.",

It was simple comforting moorish best of all uses an ancient grain that's actually good for you (black glutinous rice is high in fiber iron vit E; anti-inflammatory; helps keep limbs warm). Agree with the other reviewers that 3C of water was excessive. For it to be more \"pudding\" than \"porridge\" try 3C minis 2 TBS of water:) It takes 30-35 mins to cook. I'll switch the rice ratio next time to 1/2C black rice 1/3C white rice and maybe that will be 45 mins. I serve mine with cinnamon & vanilla ice cream! Next time I'd try it with coconut or red bean ice cream:D As the Thai would say \"than hai im na khrap / kha\" which literally means \"please eat and enjoy until you are full\" (khrap for male; kha for female\").",
