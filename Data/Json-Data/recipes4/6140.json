We eat these a lot in the summer for dinner with a salad and a loaf of good bread. YUM!

This is right for us cheddar lovers.   We really enjoyed it.   I did add some mushrooms as the author suggested and it was really good.  The only way I can describe it is as if someone took my baked mac and cheese from my childhood and made it into handy squares.   Was gone in a flash.    \n\nSomething else I really liked about it?   Didn't have to play around too much with it.   Directions were really easy to follow.   I guess my take on it is this,  if you are heavy duty cheese people leave the amount as written.   If you aren't well then, cut down on it.   I'm leaving it as is.",

I would cut back on the butter next time as the oil from the cheese is enough. After baking it at least 45 mins and letting it cool I cut it to find the bottom mushy and eggy. Yuck.
