I also didn't \"really\" measure the ingredients- I just threw in what I had of each item and it still turned out great. And dare I say it- it was even better reheated the next day for lunch! This one will be a regular in our house. (For uncooked noodles: Just layer as you normally would and add several TBSP of water to the each corners wrap tightly with foil and bake for about 50 min on 350. When a knife easily slices thru the layers it's finished. Take off foil and broil for a few minutes to brown the cheese.)",

I also only had 1 lb of thawed spinach and that was too much for us. Can't imagine it with any more. Definitely needs more mushrooms too - more like 8 cups for our taste. I did not cook the noodles first and it cooked up fine with a bit of water added in the corner of my lasagna pan. Will make again and change it up per our tastes. The milk/flour ratio is spot on and the sauce thickened beautifully. Nice change of pace.",

I'm not a fan of ricotta cheese so I only used about a quarter cup or so. Everything else I did by the recipe. I also think that a little salt really added to the flavor so next time I will add salt as well as pepper. It is perfect for mushroom lovers; if you are not a hard core mushroom fan you will want to scale back on the amount you put in. I will definitely add this one to my recipe book thanks!",

Make sure you season your cheese blend and spinach mixture. Otherwise pretty delicious!",
