Everyone in my family loved it and it is definitely one that I will be making again and again...for those of you who have never tried French pork pie it can be somewhat of an aquired taste with the strange combination of spices. I have found that most people either love it or hate it. I would also like to add that I am always surprised when people leave ratings of 1 or 2 stars for a recipe when it is a food that they never tried before and do not care for the taste...their rating has more to do with personal likes/dislikes and not the actual success of the recipe...let's face it. If you don't like the taste of tourtiers regardless of which recipe you try you are not going to like tourtiers. I take a lot of stock in the amount of stars a recipe has and almost overlooked this recipe because of negative reviews from people who didn't know how tourtiers were supposed to taste.",

Like my grandmothers I use a fresh ham and boil it until well cooked and falling from the bone. It may be hard to find a fresh ham so substituting the ground pork works too. I then grind the ham and put the potatoes through the grinder/strainer as well. The rest of the recipe is basically the same except we didn't/don't use celery or bay leaf. And the pastry dough is made fresh...preferably with lard. Glad to see someone else knows what this wonderful dish is!:)",
