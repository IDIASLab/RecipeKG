I used spinach instead of ham. 3. I mixed the onions and mushrooms together. 4. I added gruyere to the cheddar (also I used Cheddar from Borough Market/Neal's Dairy Yard) and it was DELICIOUS.  This was an amazing recipe. I studied many others that called for half and half and in all seriousness didn't feel like I missed a thing without it. I served this with Whole Foods 365 Maple Sausage Links and Smoked Salmon Nova and everyone seemed pleased.  Rather than put the meat in the strata.",
