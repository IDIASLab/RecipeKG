I sprinkled the cabbage with soy sauce while cooking and thought it was delicious, though would have been good with just salt too. The dumplings (which I doubled to have enough for the cabbage) were very heavy and bland. The dumplings need to be tiny. Next time I make the dumplings I will double the recipe, add 1 tsp of baking powder for some fluffiness and some salt for a little more flavor.",
