I did not add the food coloring and my color was still bright red. The only thing I didn't like about this punch was that the lemonade concentrates I used had some lemon pulp in them and that floated to the top of the punch bowl and almost looked like dust had gotten in there. I used Minute Maid Pink Lemonade and also MM Raspberry Lemonade which were great except for the pulp. This is one of the tastiest punch recipes I've tried.",
