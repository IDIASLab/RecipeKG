I tested out making smaller ones using my small pastry/candy sized baking tin (normally I use it for peanut butter cups) and although they didn't make as pronounced of a cup shape they worked really well and turned into bite sized BLT bowls! The large ones were difficult to share as well as made for a lot of bacon for one person to eat during a party (only appetizers were set out) and for 15 strips of bacon I only got 5 big cups. I got several little cups from just a few slices so I'll work on perfecting the smaller size next time around. I'm guessing if I wrap around (rather than weave) I could manage smaller cups.",

Then cut through the paper and bacon with kitchen shears making 4 bowls. I flopped the bacon mats on the backside of oven-safe \"monkey dishes\" (little ramekins) and peeled off the parchment paper. I baked it at 350 until it browned (350 so my dishes wouldn't break). Then I put the mat of bacon inside the dish and back in the oven to get the other side browned. Be careful it's hot! I used \"ove gloves\". It took a while and I thought it was a pain but first bite it was OMG! So crispy and delicious! This is 5 stars all the way!! I will be making these again. Thank you KoalaFace for sharing such an AWESOME recipe!",

I put a little squirt of mayo on the bottom of the cups before i put in the lettuce and tomato. Also my bacon generally needs about 20-30 mins to bake. I take a piece of bacon and cut it in thirds. Halfs is too bit but sometimes thirds is a bit small to put over the mini muffin tins. But this size is perfect for one big bite. I brought it to three different holiday parties and it was the first app to go. Enjoy!",
