Instead, I substituted mashed sweet potatoes and used ground turkey. It tastes even better the next day when slices are grilled in a pan with butter, then place on bread slices to make a sandwich. The biggest secret to the taste is the sweetness from the sweet potato!",

For the leftovers I followed the advice in the original recipe and grilled thick slices in a pan with some butter. The leftovers were SO good not so mushy as when it was first cooked.

My 2 oldest kids adored it and the adults all thought it was delicious. My youngest son wasn't too impressed but he doesn't like sweet potatoes so that wasn't a suprise. The cold leftovers went in seconds as a fantastic sandwich filler. I found that the leftovers stayed together better as it was very moist when first cooked. Good recipe!",

I also left out the ketchup and put it on top instead, and I used Progresso breadcrumbs instead of slices of bread. I'm only giving this a 4 because I think the measurements need some revision.

All of this being said the taste of the meatloaf was really quite good - even for those who don't love the taste of ground turkey. Maybe the original contributor of this recipe (or someone who's had success) could suggest a measured amount of sweet potato?",
