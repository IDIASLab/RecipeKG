I dredged the meat in the flour mixture and browned the meat. I did not bother transferring anything to the crockpot, I just added it all and once it was simmering, I put a lid on it, turned down the heat and just let it cook down and thicken. It took about an hour and a half to get to gravy consistancy. I served this and though we wanted to love it, it was REALLY salty. I think it might have been different if it had been served over plain rice or even buttered egg noodles.......but I don't know. I apologize, this just wasn't for us.",

First of all I think there is something wrong with step one. 1/4 cup of flour 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce makes a paste that really isn't cut for dredging meat in...I think the measurements must be off a little bit. I like Worcestershire sauce but the taste of it was a bit too strong in this recipe especially when paired with the flavor of the wine. The instructions also leave out instructions about when to add the Kitchen Bouquet so I just added mine when I added the merlot etc. I love the premise of this recipe but I think it needs a bit of adjusting. As written the rice was actually my favorite part.",

I didn't realize I was low on Worcestershire so in step 1, I added some olive oil and wine to make a thick coating liquid.  Then followed the recipe, except I simmered on the stove instead of slow cooker. Took a couple of hours then made rice.  No browning sauce here, so just browned per recipe then added ingredients as written.  Love how the rice came out and there was plenty of gravy. I always add garlic powder, onion powder and heat (like red pepper flakes) to everything to our taste. Wow! this is a winner!!!! \nOh, and had to use sirloin tip steaks that we cut into tips because that's what the grocery store had.",
