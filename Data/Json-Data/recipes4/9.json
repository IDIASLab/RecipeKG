I know you might think the combo of ingredients is rather odd, but when they cook together, they taste wonderful! Here are some tips: You can use boneless skinless breasts and cook for about an hour. Thousand island dressing is what I have always used (as opposed to Russian dressing) and it is great. You can use jellied cranberry sauce or whole cranberry sauce and both work fine. Covering with tin foil for at least 1/2 the baking time is recommended as the sauce may burn a bit. Finally, make sure you make some rice with this to soak up the yummy sauce! Enjoy!",

If you use the slow cooker you should skin the chicken and add two tbsp of cornstarch and extra pepper or poultry seasoning to the cold sauce and so I threw in about 12 skinnless boneless thighs while still frozen and cooked in the crock for 8 hours.
