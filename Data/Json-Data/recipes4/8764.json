I only used one 14 oz bag of cornbread stuffing and this filled up my oval shaped 13 x 9 pan. Also after it was done cooking I poured several large spoonfuls of gravy over the top. That really helped it be more flavorful and more moist.",

The cornbread is a great base to bring together the sweet spicy smokey and savory flavors without completely departing from the traditional comfort food flavors that we crave during the holidays.",
