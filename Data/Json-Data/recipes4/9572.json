My son-in-law had a no, thank you portion...then a larger portion.  My daughter e-mailed the next day about how wonderful the basil fettuccine was, ending with DH taking the remainder for his lunch at work.  This is one fabulous recipe. I finished the gardening season by making 8 balls of basil pasta dough and freezing them to use later. UPDATE: Feb 5, 2007  Temp yesterday was 2 deg below zero.  I made basil pasta using the dough I had made and previously frozen.  I used egg substitute at that time in preparation for freezing.  Not sure if that was necessary, but it gave me a comfort level I liked.  What was great pasta before was unbelievably fantastic with boiled shrimp added to the dish.  I have a saying that I have used for many years, and it applies here. \"It doesn't get any better than this!\"",

I served this with sauteed tomatoes and garlic per another reviewer and it had great plate appeal and was loved by all the kids. Also I don't have a pasta machine - I just rolled it out until it was quite thin, sliced it thickly as for fettucine and let it dry. I also only let it rest in the fridge for 45 minutes so I'm not sure what the extended time would do overall for the finished product. This definitely gives me more confidence to try other hand made pasta recipes.",
