I LOVE dried cranberries so this chicken salad was right up my alley. I chopped up the chicken and opted to used celery in place of the green onions. I also chopped up a Red Delicious apple vs. shredding it. I mixed the dressing in a separate bowl before folding it into the chicken and other ingredients. For the dressing I used Hellman's light mayo and cut it with a bit of reduced fat sour cream I also used curry powder vs. dill. I'm a huge fan of dill, but for this salad I felt the curry powder just paired better. I let this set in the fridge for a few hours, after sneaking a few bits and WOW, what a wonderful combination of flavors! This was so good on whole grain bread. Thanks Rachel for a wonderful recipe!",

My changes were to skip the green onion, used red apple for green apple, and almond slices for pecans.  That's because it was what I had on hand.  I love the way the dried cranberries add a sweetness and the nuts add the crunch.  Such a FANTASTIC easy recipe.  Thank you for sharing Rachel!   You made my day!!",
