I used wasabi powder because that's what was in the cupboard ground ginger (ditto) and added both a little at a time until it was how I wanted it. Also I didn't need 1/2c of mayo - just a couple of heaped tbsps. I used the tuna salad to top a couple of split toasted buttered English muffins - the contrasting textures worked extremely well. I really really enjoyed this and can't wait to make it again for lunch tomorrow! Thanks! (PS I did indeed make it the next day. I made it into a regular sandwich for husband - on white bread as recommended - and while he still really enjoyed it he said it was MUCH better on the toasted muffin. I have to agree!)",

Add wasabi slowly tasting as you go.",
