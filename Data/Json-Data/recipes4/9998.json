So here you vegans go and enjoy but don't eat too many too fast like I did cause now I have a belly ache!!!!  For a twist, replace the maple syrup with hazelnut syrup, or any other flavor you like. If you want to throw some semi-sweet chocolate chips on the top and fold the crepe up over them, they melt and get all gushy on the inside. Makes about 16 crepes with a 6-inch diameter.",

The only reason I didn't give this recipe five stars is because they are very hard to flip in the cooking process. I ended up ruining about half of them before I decided not to flip them. They are so delicate that they kept falling apart on the flip. Instead of flipping them, I waited until the top was dry and then slid it onto the plate. This worked fine since they are so thin. They were very tasty filled with fresh sliced strawberries and bananas drizzled with honey.",

I had to add some water to make it thin enough...cooked on my cast iron skillet, made absolutely beautiful crepes without a hitch.  Served with strawberry sauce and they were divine.  My family thanks you.  Would rate it more than 5 stars if I could.",

                "reviewBody": "I've been making these for quite a while now great for my toddler son who's allergic to eggs and dairy. The key to successful flipping is to not flip the crepe too early. I keep it on medium heat wait until the edges are golden brown and when the outer edges of the top side batter starts to \"dry\" a bit they're a cinch to flip and come out great each time. Also the crepe tends to stick to itself so if you flip too early or fold it over on itself it can get pretty messy. Like others I make the batter at night so it'll be ready in the morning. I usually make 1/2 batch since my son doesn't eat that much and it lasts him several days. The batter has always lasted in the fridge for 4-5 days without any problems though it might need a little stirring first. They really do taste surprisingly delicious with no eggs! Thanks for a great recipe!",

I left out the sugar and the syrup to make them savory crepes and filled them with fried mushrooms, baked asparagus and tomato.    I did have to add more soy milk to make the batter thin enough, but with the extra soy milk, the consistency was just like that of a regular crepe, and though they didn't have the buttery flavor of my regular crepe recipe, they were quite tasty.  My vegan friend was thrilled and amazed, since apparently she had tried to make vegan crepes before with no luck.  Highly recommended for vegans and friends of vegans!",
