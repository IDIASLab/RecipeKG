The seasonings were way off. 1 tbsp of turmeric seemed way too much to me so I erred on the side of caution and only used half the amount - still too much. It made the dish so incredibly bitter. I also used less nutritional yeast than called for about 1/3 cup. This had an interesting smell when cooking. Not something I would make again even with tweaks.",

I had leftover white quinoa so used that; subbed freshly grated Parmesan cheese for nutritional yeast and freshly grated turmeric root for the ground. I agree with other reviewers though that a tablespoon of ground turmeric seems like far too much. I'd say less than 1 teaspoon would be enough. And if I make this again I'd use a bit less lemon juice.",

It's still missing a little something, maybe some salt to enhance the flavors? I used homemade vegetable broth to cook the quinoa and for the dish, so it didn't have any salt in it. Overall I thought it was a unique lunch dish and I'd try again with some more tweaking.",
