I could only give it three stars--and I am being generous here--because the peas were not done even after continued cooking for two extra hours. By the time the peas were done the tomatoes and other ingredients were overcooked. Shouldn't the peas be soaked for at least three hours or so beforehand? I definitely think this recipe is a winner and a keeper. And I am going to make it again...after I find out/figure out how to fully cook the peas. When that happens I will give it the full five-star rating that it so rightfully deserves.",

I was concerned about that with the leftovers if I slow cooked it.  User the base recipe but here's my modifications - Soaked peas overnight, drained. Begin on the stove top w/ a dutch oven or big pot.  Used leftover spiral ham from Turkeyday instead of bacon. 8c water, can of chicken stock, cut up jalapeno nacho slices, can of fire roasted tomatoes (held off on these till after the boil), and tyme in addtion to garlic and chili powder. Brought to boil, and then low simmer for 2-3 hours. The first day it did need a little minor seasoning w/ salt & pepper, but it had a little zip to it. 2nd day was really good. Finished the last bowl today and was wishing I have a 2nd bowl. Served with fresh cornbread.",

To me, it is not the recipe provider's responsibility to teach people how to cook, but solely to share a great recipe with directions of how to prepare it. A person should already know how to soak and clean the peas before attempting a dish like this. I used spicy hot link sausages instead of bacon to flavor the peas, but next time I will try bacon as instructed. Also, I had jarred jalapeno's, so I chopped a few and threw them in. Since I am a fan of spiciness, I also added tobasco sauce which made for a great, highly flavored reddish colored juice along with the stewed tomatos for the peas to soak the flavor of. AWESOME!",
