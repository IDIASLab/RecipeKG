My modification was to also add 1/2 of a 8oz jar of alcaparrado (a mix of green olives, pimento & capers)which is common to cuban cooking. Left is going in the slow cooker all day... served it with \"moros & christianos\" aka Moors & Christians(black beans and white rice). Shop your local mexican grocery, if available. The added ingredients are worth the trip!",

It was a pretty decent take on regular chicken fricasse.\r\n\r\nThings I would do differently: \r\n\r\nRemove the skin prior to cooking and add some chicken breasts also.  \r\n\r\nThings I added to the recipe: I added a can of chopped Italian tomatoes with garlic and oregano and two packets of Sazon' (a Caribbean\r\nspice or seasoning packet-great flavor).  I also added 5 large stuffed green olives. I served my dish over white rice and still used the potatoes too.  My kids ate the chicken easily as it was soft and fell right off the bone.\r\n\r\nI will use this recipe again for its ease in preparation and because my family enjoyed it.\r\n",

I stopped at the store and picked up SazonGoya and Goya Sofrito as recommended. I got home later so it had already been cooking an hour or so longer. I added some more white wine some chicken broth and the extra seasoning. My beau doesn't like dark meat so fearful I might have ruined the whole meal I baked 4 chicken breasts and threw that in too what the heck. I served over white rice. The meat feel right off the bones it was so tender! Sooo tasty! You just have to add the extra seasoning. I think the extra cooking time helped too it \"thickened\" everything up and the potatoes were tender. My boyfriend loved this dish adn we ate the leftovers for days. I would make this again!",

Looking back, of course, it's best to remove the skin and adding olives makes it wonderful.  I don't know why \"Allrecipes\" added the sage, as I only use 1-2 bay leaves in it.  You can make this quickly in a dutch oven on the stove too.  The Goya seasoning or something like it should also have been included in the ingredients.  Hope you continue to love it!  Jenny!!!",
