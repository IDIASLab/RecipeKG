When we are ready for a fast dinner, I just pop out a few and either toss them into the sauce to warm back up, or put them in the microwave for a bit.  I love this recipe and now always have some in my freezer.",

And to my surprise I did have a can of butter beans which I have never used before in my life. I decided to \"pulse\" the beans through my food processor instead of mashing with a spoon because I did not want big pieces of bean skin in the meatballs. I also threw in 3 cloves of fresh garlic into the processor as well. I used a whole wheat Italian style bread crumb added some dried parsley and some grated pecorino romano cheese for a more authentic Italian meatball taste. I baked these instead of fried and used my small cookie scoop to form the meatballs. These were so tasty and we just dipped them in some homemade marinara and ate them as is. Will def make again and its a great way to eat a leaner meatball and have that extra fiber added w/o the kids noticing. Thanks!",

I took another person's suggestion to bake them for about 25 minutes at 400 degrees instead of frying in a pan - it works out terrific! Suggestion: When I am rolling the meatballs I keep a shallow dish with a tiny bit of canola oil in in it and when my hands get too sticky to work with I touch my hands lightly into the oil and then pat gently around the meatball..it really helps!",

I was very skeptical looking at the mix since I've never made a \"healthy meatball\" before but I had a back up plan so I continued and was not disappointed. The meatballs were moist and delicious! My hubby is taking the leftovers for lunch today he raved over them! They are more filling than the average meatball so dinner can go a little further with these also. Made with rice and gravy next time I think I'll try with red sauce. Eating healthier wouldn't be so scary if there were more recipes like this one! Thanks!",
