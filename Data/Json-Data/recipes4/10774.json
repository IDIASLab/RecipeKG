I made the stir fry by first sauteing the ginger and garlic, then adding all of the vegetables, followed by the tofu. Next, I added the soy sauce and then the cornstarch in water to make the stir fry sauce. Tossing the vegetables in an oil-cornstarch mix may have caused the \"gummy texture\" problems reported by other viewers.\n\nThis is a good basic stir fry recipe. If you find it bland, you can increase the amount of ginger and garlic, as well as add a bit of chili paste or crushed red pepper flakes to give it a bit more kick.",

Of course I had to tweak your recipe a bit for my family, but your garlic/ginger/corn starch blend is a keeper! Here is what I did tonight- Hubby demands meat, so cooks chicken breast first and cut it up. I used two bags of Walmart brand sugar snap peas stir fry (1.50/bag), I had to use powdered ginger this time (but I'm sure the fresh would be AWESOME, will try that next time). Since I had so many veggies, I doubled the soy sauce. I also added a can of pineapple chuncks with the juice just before serving. VERY GOOD! thank you for posting!",
