I used bacon grease vs. olive oil and sauted the onion and garlic then added two pounds of collard greens. I used a dandoodle (VA/NC seasoned meat) water not chicken broth and red pepper flakes. After 45 minutes on the stove the greens were bitter so I added 1T. brown sugar and 1 T. apple cider vinegar. I transferred the greens to a slow cooker and let it sit in the fridge overnight with the dandoodle which provides the seasonings. I cooked the greens on low for 4-6 hours and kept adding brown sugar to eliminate the bitterness. Overall I probably added 1/4 c. brown sugar and 2 T. apple cider vinegar for the 2lbs. of fresh collard greens. My BIL uses honey vs. brown sugar. Definitely a keeper! Delicious and this slow cooker method does not make the greens turn to mush but I prefer the fresh onions and garlic of the kickin' collard green recipe.",
