Pretty good but needed a little something extra for my taste. So today I added a smear of plain cream cheese to the sandwich and YUM! That was the extra something it needed. It's a strange concoction and an acquired taste, but on a cold day it was really gooey & satisfying. And to my surprise, he bacon is actually good with it.",
