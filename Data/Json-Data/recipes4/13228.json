I also added round onion, bok choy chinese cabbage along with the watercress and bean sprouts. In all the years I made this, my meat was sometimes a little on the tough side, by simmering in the sauce for 40 minutes per your instructions,before adding all the veggies, OMG!!!, IT WAS SOOO TENDER!!  I now know what I was doing wrong all these years.  Thank you sooooo much Keani. I love these types of recipes because they're inspiring and you can pretty much play with it.  If I had shiitake mushrooms, they would have went in too.  This is great over rice.  Yummmy",
