I did not add any salt as there is plenty in the cheese and canned crabmeat I used.  It didn't need any.  I baked mine in a 7 x 11 dish.  I would probably double this recipe for more than 4 people, if it is the only maindish you are serving.",

To be honest, I think it was a little overwhelming with the seasoned croutons and the Old Bay Seasoning....it over powered the taste of the crab.
