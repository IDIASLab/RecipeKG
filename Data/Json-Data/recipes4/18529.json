I made this exactly as the recipe calls out and I have only one issue with it. It is incredibly salty and I was unable to continue eating it. Normally I like salty foods but this asked for 3 tablespoons of Adobo in addition to the ham and 2 tablespoons of olive brine. I think maybe 3 teaspoons was meant but that may even be too much with the sodium from the other sources as well. I will definitely make this again since this is my kids and my favorite meal but I will use less of the Adobo while preparing and add it post cooking to taste.",
