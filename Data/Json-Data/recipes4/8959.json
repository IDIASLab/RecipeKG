I see that someone recommended an extra can of coconut milk - that would be fine but for me I felt there was a sufficient amount of coconut milk. BUT the whole thing was just so bland. The picture provided is clearly not this recipe as it is given, as a simple scan through the ingredients will uncover nothing to make the sauce a beautiful curry yellow nor anything with the color red (although you could easily add your own red peppers). I actually added some shredded coconut in an attempt to make the coconut flavor a little stronger - because really, it's just coconut milk, onion, green beans and chicken. (I did add garlic but that didn't save it either) So in the end, it's not horrible, it's just very boring, and a recipe I won't make again.",
