I love sweet potato fries and I make them all the time because of this recipe.  The secret is to make sure they are all cut fairly evenly and they are spaced out on the pan.  If they are crowded too close together they will not cook properly.\n\nAlso always make sure to turn them at least once or they will get burned on one side.  Regular potatoes you don't have to be so careful but sweet potatoes you do for some reason.",
