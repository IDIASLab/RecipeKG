I also added a little garlic, salt, chicken boullion, and cayenne pepper.  \nMy first time cooking potato soup & it will definitely not be the last!!",

I subbed a leek for celery shallot for onion chicken broth for bullion/water and cornstarch for flour. I had only about 1 Tbs butter and made that work too. For being so short on some key ingredients it turned out great! It's also good to know I could make it with much less butter and it still tasted wonderful! Next time I will be sure to have flour otherwise I kinda like the revisions I had to make. I had to use a little more than a cup of milk but that may be due to the cornstarch.",

The problem with doing it without flour and milk is that it is a ton of butter; next time I'll probably half it. The other problem is that there is no way you can realistically feed 8 people with as much as it makes. I would say it is closer to 4 or 6 servings.",
