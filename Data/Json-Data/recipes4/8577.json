I put in a roasting pan, after 20 min everything was still raw, I ended up roasting for 1 hour which cooked the veggies perfectly but made the pork dry. I live at high altitude so everything tends to take a little longer. The flavor of the sauce didn't really permeate the meat, maybe because I overcooked it. I think I will marinade the meat next time. I also think I'll start the veggies roasting and add the meat a little later. This recipe has real potential and will definitely make again.",

I used plain white vinegar because I didn't have white wine vinegar and added an additional teaspoon of honey. Also I only used one pork tenderloin and 25 minutes was not long enough. I needed to cook it for a total of an hour before the juices were running clear. When I broiled it on low for 5 minutes the cabbage around the edges of the pan got burnt. If do this again I'll leave the rack in the middle instead of moving it 4\" away from the element. I'd also add onion and maybe I'll use a bit of mustard powder so that it has a stronger mustard taste as well.",
