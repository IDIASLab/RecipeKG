I did use a rotisserie chicken, only one can of chilis (was perfect amount), 2 cups Monterey Jack and then skipped pepper jack cheese and cayenne pepper so it wasn't too spicy for kids. Anything more than what I put in would've been too much for them.  Also I could only find a 14oz jar Alfredo sauce and it was a light version which worked great. Made me feel slightly better about how fattening this is lol. Next time ill just use two cans yellow corn. Beware this is hearty and rich but delicious!",
