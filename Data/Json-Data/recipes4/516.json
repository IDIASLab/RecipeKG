However, this recipe was so savory, with just a few changes.  Along with all the vegetables I added 2 cups of diced potatoes, also replaced chicken broth with vegetable broth.  Also, I did not have a seasoning blend, so added 1Tbsp of curry powder, 1 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp ground thyme, 1tsp parsley flakes and 2Tbsp soy sauce.  After simmering for 2-1/2 hrs as suggested, the flavors were perfectly melded and I blended 1/2 the soup and left the remainder chunky.  Absolutely yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!",

The Soup turned out Great!\n\nNote: Since the split pea breaks down when cooking I do not recommend pureeing the soup but that is just a preference.",
