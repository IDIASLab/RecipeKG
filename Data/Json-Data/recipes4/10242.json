Had I done research on bread baking tips I would've noticed that the yeast didn't \"activate\". My advice is to buy enough yeast to test out..if it doesn't bubble or foam it's no good and to cut this recipe so that you won't waste product. I had to throw it all away however I will try again and hopefully get it right next time.",

It isn't the very best bread I've ever made but it is very healthy and is helping me use up some of the alternative flours I have on hand from denser low-carb breads I didn't want to make. I did change it a little bit - First I reduced it to one loaf size (12 servings). I had all of the ingredients on-hand except millet flour but I did have actual millet so I cooked the lentils and 1 Tbsp of millet (since it would expand) together. I prepared as the recipe directed until it was time to mix all the ingredients together. At that point I put it into my breadmaker on the whole wheat setting 1.5 LB loaf and let it do the rest. The only other recipe change I made was to add 3 Tsp vital wheat gluten since the recipe really doesn't call for much yeast. The bread turned out nice! It is still quite dense but is very moist. It has a nice mild flavor very suitable for just some butter or using in a sandwich. Overall I am very pleased and will make this again. Thanks to its author!",

Also I pre-heated my oven at 170 degrees then shut the oven off before putting the greased bread in to rise the first time. Did the same when I put them into loaf pans after that removed them putting them on the stove top while pre-heating for baking. They turned out very well it's a dense loaf very filling. I sliced them thinner so I got 72 servings all together the electric knife worked great for slicing. Also put poppy seeds into the bread because I like them.",
