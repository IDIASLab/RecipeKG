The main thing I did was precook the zucchini (steamed for about 5 minutes) & brown the ground beef. (I substituted 1 pound of ground turkey.) Cooking raw ground beef/turkey w/o browning never seems to turn out well for me. I omitted the water & salt (unnecessary) as well as the jalapeno pepper (my family doesn't do spicy) & used just 1 teaspoon of black pepper. I also substituted reduced fat Cheddar slices for the American cheese. I assembled the casserole as directed then put it in the oven for just 5 minutes. Then I took it out to put the basil on it & stuck it in the oven for 5 more minutes. It was ready to eat.",
