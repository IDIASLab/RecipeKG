The only tips I have are related to baking. 1) Greasing the pan tends to make the dough slip, so I grease and lightly flour the pan; 2) baking the crust for 15 min before placing everything on top was key, as another reviewer mentioned. For my taste, I add a bit of minced fresh garlic and chili pepper flakes. This is the recipe we use all the time, with Quick and Easy Pizza Crust also from this site; I don't use frozen. Tasty!",
