Started out with just 1 tsp curry powder, tasted, and then added the second tsp (curry flavor was spot on IMO).  Made as written, tasted, and I added 1 more Tbsp of both the ketchup and the chutney.  Also, it was looking VERY dry, so I added a little water to help cook the cabbage.  I thought it needed some type of garnish, so I added a little toasted coconut.  Have no idea if that\u2019s keeping with tradition, but we liked it, and I\u2019d add it again.  Bottom line, we liked this a lot. It\u2019s nice to occasionally step outside your comfort zone, and this was a step out for me!  Joan Wagner Teller, thanks for sharing your recipe.",
