This was really close so happy I tried this recipe. Did some tweaking can't find real crawfish in Ohio so I substituted Langostinos. I don't have cajun seasoning so I used Old Bay sprinkled on plus a dash or two of cayenne and a little pepper. Tasted and thought I needed more pepper accidentally opened the wrong side and dumped a good teaspoon of pepper into the dish it was perfect! I like spicy but not super hot. I used the mushroom garlic soup and used the minced roasted garlic in a jar. This was fabulous! Thank you!",
