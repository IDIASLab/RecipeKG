I didn't saute them in a skillet, prefering instead to grill them. I also built a \"deluxe\" version of this sandwich by adding bacon, Romaine lettuce, and sliced tomato. It was out of this world delicious and, paired with \"Rachel's Tomato Basil Soup,\" was a picture perfect summer meal.   ",

I ended up using Pommery which is a stone ground French mustard. Very very grainy and thick. Worked so well that I started fantasizing about starting a restaurant so that I could serve this sanddwich.",
