I  just pushed some olive slices down into the corn casserole after it came out of the oven, so no problem there.  It was a little runny/wet on the bottom, and it just tasted too much like canned corn to me.  If I were to make this again, I\u2019d  start by using frozen corn instead of canned, and maybe even add some chopped jalape\u00f1o for a bit more flavor (personal taste).  It was OK, but overall, I would say it was just a little \u201csoggy\u201d for lack of a better word, not at all creamy.  And by the time you let it stand until set (15-20 minutes), it was lukewarm when served.  But it certainly is quick and easy to make, so that's a plus.",
