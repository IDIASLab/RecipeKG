I did make a few changes ro the recipe most notably that 2 1/2 C of liquid looked very inadequate in the bottom of my 6-qt. slow cooker so I ended up using 3 whole cans of beef broth 1 C water. With that 1 can of spicy V8 was still plenty hot enough to give me a little heartburn (and I love spicy foods.) I also used frozen mixed veggies instead of canned and an hour before the end of the cooking time I added the V8 2 cubed potatoes and a can of diced tomatoes. P.S. I just made this for the second time using 2 lbs. of meat and more seasoned salt/pepper and I AM IN LOVE with this recipe! Thanks a million!",

Will save this recipe for just such a time! I didn't measure out a TBLS of season salt - just added liberally until it \"looked\" right. Also during the last half hour when you add the V8 \"spicy hot\" juice & mixed veggies I added a handful of macaroni noodles. 30 minutes later this soup was great! Thanks for sharing this one Kim!
