I halved the recipe for an 8X8 pan though I found I did still need to use the full amount of eggs/milk to cover the rest of the ingredients. I added diced green pepper and onion so they may have accounted for the need for more egg mixture. I kept the spices the same as the full recipe and added about 1/8tsp white pepper. While we did enjoy this I think i'd prefer everything mixed together using hash browned potatoes in place of the frozen prepared patties. Regardless a great jumping off point to customize to YOUR preference. THANKS for the recipe!",

I've made it with ham, turkey ham, and no meat at all (but I add a bunch of chopped spring onions.)  I really like using Coleman's mustard for the dry mustard.  It adds a great flavor.  I just made it again for Mother's Day brunch.  I couldn't find hash brown patties, so I used tater tots.  Even that was good.  This recipe is foolproof!",

I also didn't have dry mustard so I added black pepper and some hot sauce. I also threw in a diced yellow pepper that I needed to use up. My 16 yr old son and I actually had this for dinner, and then I ate leftovers for breakfast the next few days. Very satisfying and yummy. I'm sure you could add other vegetables that you have in the fridge that need to be used up. Would probably even be good with swiss cheese instead of cheddar.",
