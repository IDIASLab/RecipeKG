I also ran out of honey after about 4 T so I left as-is and the bread was divine. If you're like me and don't have a stand mixer with a dough hook don't fret. I mixed all this up very successfully with a hand mixer and then kneaded on a lightly floured surface. What the directions don't tell you is to remove the bread from the pans immediately after baking. I learned from another bread recipe that allowing the bread to sit in the pans can likely form mold on the bottom of the loaf down the road. Allow the bread to cool completely on a wire rack and then bag it up. I kept one loaf out and froze the other. I can't wait to have a grilled cheese with this bread! Great recipe!!",
