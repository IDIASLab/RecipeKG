I doubled the recipe and used the 8x8 dish to make it thicker; then cut it in 1 squares. In doubling the recipe I used the whole 2# bag of confectioners sugar and did not measure. A note about the troubles others may have had: When it says butter don t use margarine or spread; milk means vitamin D milk not 2% or skim; and always sift confectioners sugar unless a recipe explicitly states unsifted then resift with the cocoa and cinnamon. Both the confectioners sugar and cocoa tend to lump.",

I put a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon (because I love the stuff!) and no nuts as I didn't have any. I am making it again to take to work this week (it was a hit at my craft club!). I took a shortcut I microwaved the butter and then added the milk to it I use skim milk powder to make my milk and used a wee bit more powder than what is required for 1/4 cup of milk. I sifted all my ingredients in a bowl mixed them gently and then added butter/milk mixture to the dry ingredients and stirred with a wooden spoon until all was homogenous. I then poured it in a baking paper lined bread tin so I had a nice thick fudge (as opposed to more pieces and thinner) which I cut in about 1/2 in. squares. This recipe's a keeper!! (wonder what it would taste like with different spices instead of cinnamon!)",

After sitting for a few days in the fridge it got as far as not being runny but still never set -- no way I could cut it. However without thinking I used lower fat margarine and thought perhaps that was the problem but I see that a few others had this same problem. Perhaps it needs real butter and some people don't use it? I also thought it a bit too sweet even for fudge. But the flavor was fabulous -- I'm not a big fudge fan and have never made it but was curious what cinnamon fudge would be like. Since it didn't set right I just occasionally grab a spoonful.:-) IF I decide to try it again I will use real butter and see what happens. As for a few comments I saw about the sugar not disolving -- I had no problems with this. I always sift confectioners' sugar -- maybe the recipe should explicitly state to do this.",

I added extra con. sugar until it thickened up nicely ( as in the recipe for the vegan fudge if anyone has used it) We like our fudge a but more on the gritty side vs. the creamy side. I did add a larger amount of cinnamon since it is titled \"cinnamon fudge\" =) I literally just made it and it's now in the fridge. Will have to do a follow up on it later since I made it for our party this evening. Right now the 4 stars are for ease of making the fudge.",
