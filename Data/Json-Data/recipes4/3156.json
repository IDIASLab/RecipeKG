I read on another site that this needs to be made with good quality chocolate for the layers to adhere. I used a combination of Nestle's chips and a store brand (make sure it contains cocoa butter) and had no problems. Save some of the candy cane bits to sprinkle in top for color. You need to press them in. Very tasty will make again.",

The only thing I'd change is the part where you put the white on the milk chocolate. If you let it set fully the layers will break apart when making pieces. If you put the second layer on while the milk chocolate is still mostly liquid they will set together.",
