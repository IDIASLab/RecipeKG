We substitue more-easily-obtained ingredients: Canned minced clams for fresh, fresh potatoes (fingerlings or cut-up baking potatoes). Reduced dill to two teaspoons vs three tablespoons called for in the recipe, onion to one vs two, black pepper to two teaspoons vs two tablespoons, salt less then 1/2 teas vs 1 teas. I didn't think I even liked dill, but now I try to find recipes WITH dill. This chowder disappears quickly, so make a double batch. With excellent flavors and easy prep, it's a regular in our house. (I try to use organic celery because celery is usually at the top of the \"Dirty Dozen.\")",

I'm sure it would be even better with freshly shucked clams. The first time I made it since I love spicy food I used all of the pepper called for in the recipe even though I knew it was a lot. It was too hot for my wife to enjoy although she said the flavor was great. The next time I made it I only used 1T black pepper and a few dashes of hot sauce. I omitted the cayenne. She loved it!!
