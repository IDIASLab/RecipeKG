I sauteed these in a dutch oven with olive oil, then added the water, rice, bouillion, salt and pepper and brought to a boil.  Then I covered and placed in oven at 375.  It's important the the water is boiling before going in oven!  After 1/2 hour I added the vegetables.  I ended up baking for about 70 minutes, but I think it could have baked for another 10 minutes, as some of the wild rice hadn't popped open yet.  Very tasty and I love how it uses such colorful vegetables!",

Add chicken to this and it turns out great. My kids really do love it!",
