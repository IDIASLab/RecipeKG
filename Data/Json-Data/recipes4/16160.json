I made my own mushroom soup which was really good on its own so I have to think it is better than canned. The flavors worked perfectly together. I chose to omit the French fried onions and instead mixed the bacon with breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan then topped the whole thing with more Parmesan half way through baking. I thought about leaving out the red pepper flakes but I am so glad I didn't. There isn't enough to make the dish hot just enough to make your taste buds pay attention. Thanks 2bMary!",

This is not the healthiest vegetable dish but I'll bet the ingredients would be fine together without the cream of mushroom soup added. Sure there wouldn't really be a sauce if you did that but who doesn't like cauliflower bacon and cheese on their own? This would be a side dish that would be filling enough for me as a lunch during the work week so if I make it again I will definitely do that to use up leftovers. Flavor was great and would go along side almost any entree. The only thing I changed was the baking time - mine was cooked through and brown after about 30 minutes. Thank you for the recipe 2bmary!",
