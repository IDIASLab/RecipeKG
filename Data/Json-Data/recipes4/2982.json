My children and grandchild now insist I make them on all our camping trips. Each person assembles their own sandwich just how they like it, with or without sauerkraut, extra cheese, or any way in-between. Use a permanent marker to label the packets.

I bought deli corned and roast beef, turkey and ham(kids are picky). Also used swiss, american, and pepperjack cheeses. I laid everything out on table and let each assemble their own to their liking. I made mine as stated in the recipe. Except we all used ff thousand island. This was excellent!! My fiance had never tried a reuben and fell in love with this. He tried one later at a local eatery and HATED it!! I swear its the rye... yuck. Anyway, we have made these on the grill, campfire, and in the oven. I dont check the time really, just check the food. The thicker ones were still cold in the middle when the kids sandwiches were done. We will definately keep making this one!!",

I was drawn to grilling because I do not have a large enough non-stick skillet to cook 2 sandwiches. I followed the directions to a T and my bread was burned soggy and stuck to the foil (along with the soggy mess of toppings). This was the only recipe which didn't call for buttering or oiling the bread prior to cooking so I thought it would be a healthier alternative. From now on I will load the toppings on two slices of buttered rye and cook till golden and melted in a skillet (I'll either get a larger pan or we'll eat at different times!) The recipe has flawless reviews other than mine but it really didn't work for me.",

We grill these in an openfaced fashion and use less sauce. You really can't tell when they are \"lightly toasted\" if they're all wrapped up. I don't like to use the meat and other fillings straight from the fridge because it's nearly impossible to grill them to a warmed through state without burning the bread. I also use \"thousand island dressing\" fromthis site but with Frank's Redhot rather than a sweet chili sauce. I have found that about 10 min on the grill is usually adequate and if the bread is toasting before the cheese melts you can easily slide them off the direct heat and let them finish without burning.",
