                "reviewBody": "Yummy. I think it is close to Chili's C. E. soup. I heated a tbsp olive oil and added 2 cloves of garlic and then added 3 small chicken breasts. I cooked the breasts in a pot on both sides until juices were clear. Then I removed the chicken and added the diced onions and cooked until translucent. I poured in 2 (14.5 oz each)cans of chicken broth and stirred. I mixed 1/4 cup of masa harina which is corn flour (Quaker company makes this also found on the aisle where the Latino food products are or near the regular white flour)with a 1/2 cup of water, stir it well to get out lumps and then I added it to the pot that has the chicken broth and onions. Then I mix another 1/4 cup of masa harina with just enough water to make it like a thick, wet paste, stir it until blended, it should not look dry or crumbly, but smooth and sort of thick. I added this mixture to the pot and stirred. Then I added 1 cup water, I made up a package of mc cormick enchilada sauce and added all of it to the pot (approx. 3 cups or more), 16 oz of velveeta cheese, salt, chili powder & cumin. Stirred. Brought to a boil, stirring often so the cheese did not stick as much and also used a non-stick pot. Added diced cooked chicken. Stirred. Reduce heat and I simmer until thick about 5 minutes. This gives the soup a thick/thin top texture, not as grainy from the masa harina. I topped it with pico de gallo and crushed tortilla chips (Tia Rosa Mega thins) and a little shredded cheese. Excellente!!",

I also cut the chicken breasts up into bite-sized pieces and put them in one of those basket-vegetable steamers rather than cooking in oil.\nFrom the OTHER Tortilla Soup recipe, I also added 1/4 tsp oregano, 1 28-oz can crushed tomatoes, 1 c corn, 1 c white hominy, 1 can chopped green chilis, and 1 can black beans.  I used cilantro, grated jack cheese, and crumbled tortilla chips as a garnish.\nI tossed it all in a crockpot to finish up and my hub and I wolfed on it tonight with a margarita.  It was good!

I wouldn't recommend the corn starch that another reviewer used- this recipe gets so much of its character from the masa harina that won't shine through with corn starch. I like to use a small can of mexican style tomato sauce because it gives the same flavor but is less expensive than enchilada sauce. This soup definitely gets much thicker the second or third day so you may need to add water and if keeping it on a simmer make sure to stir often or you will have burnt cheese. (Even then it's pretty good!!!)",
