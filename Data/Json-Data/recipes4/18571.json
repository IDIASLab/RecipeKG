        "description": "Whether you are following an AIP diet, you're intolerant to grains, or you simply want to switch up the taste of your breakfast porridge with a great and creamy texture, this healthy grain-free recipe is perfect for you! This vanilla-maca tapioca porridge with a rhubarb and raspberry sauce is definitely one of my favorite grain-free porridge alternatives. As you probably saw on my Facebook and Instagram, I make it very often! What I love about this recipe is that is suitable pretty for anybody as I worked very hard to make it compliant to basically every allergy in the world.",
