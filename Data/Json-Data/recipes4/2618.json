It'll work just fine with a variety of fish; you could use tilapia, orange roughy or cod as well as haddock. Don't be taken aback by the high oven temperature as this it what gives the fish a nice, crispy crunch. I cook mine for 12 or 13 minutes and serve it with lemon wedges. This one is fool proof; try it, you'll love it!!!",

Top (don't coat all over) the fish with crackers, a modest sliver of  butter on top and bake 425 for 20 minutes.  Simple and no soggy bottom of crumbs.  No need to grease dish ... just the water or white wine if you prefer.\n     I live close to the ocean and we cook our good seafood simple.!",

Besides this recipe there is always the one that eliminates the milk altogether, subsituting about 2TBS of mayonaisse, rubbing it on with your fingers and following the rest of the recipe.  I do however spray a small rack with a nonstick spray, place the rack in my pan and bake in a hot oven for 15 minutes.  Sometimes I'll add a teaspoon of mustard to my mayo, sometimes Emeril or Old Bay to my crumbs, I do eliminate the melted butter and spray it with a butter flavored spray, it goes on more evenly and makes the fish crispier and tastes just as good. Sometimes the \"new\" is better! it's fun to experiment!",
