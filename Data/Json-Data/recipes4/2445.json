Even more so because my two-year old and I ate the rest of the leftovers and my husband pouted!! So I had to make another batch of this yummy dish. I measured my spices this go-round. and used between 1/2 and 3/4 of a teaspoon of the basil and oregano the full teaspoon of the Italian seasoning and it couldn't have been better. More fetta less parm. And used two small fresh tomatoes again and layered them in between the macaroni and the layer of cheese on top. I found the first go round that if I mixed the tomatoes in the macaroni wasn't as gooey/cheesy; it tended to seperate. so the layering worked PERFECT. Try it! You Won't Be Disappointed.",
