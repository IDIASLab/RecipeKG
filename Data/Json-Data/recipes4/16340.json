I substituted chopped fried turkey bacon for the bacon bits which was delicious. I also kept the peel on the nugget potatoes which added heartiness. I looked in my cupboard and spotted liquid smoke so added a few dashes (1-2 T.) and a few pinches of chill powder at the end- DELISH! Definitely making this recipe again. The liquid smoke made the soup VERY satisfying.",
