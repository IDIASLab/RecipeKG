It is just the two of us but we always make a full receipe and freeze the rest in 2-meal sized containers. We are having it for dinner avain tonight. Thanks for a delicious dinner.",

We loved it. There are just the two of us so there is plenty for three meals. I did put the crock pot on high for two hours and then turned to low so it would be ready when we wanted to eat. I would probably add 1/2-1 tsp of red pepper flakes because we like it spicy. My grandchildren would eat it like it was prepared and we were expecting them.
