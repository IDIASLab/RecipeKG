Many other reviewers said to add 1 cream of chicken and 1 cream of mushroom soup, and that's what I did. I also used chicken broth instead of water for the saucepan mixture. I also added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp onion powder, and I salted and peppered to taste as well. I boiled Angel Hair pasta 16 oz. in the remaining chicken broth, It made ALL the difference in the world! I used a Kroger brand cheese, they have a wonderful medium sharp cheddar, yum! To top off the cheese I sprinkled a little Progresso Italian style bread crumbs over all(another reviewersuggestion). I think you could lay some broccoli, or some other green on top of pasta and pour chicken mixture on top of that and have a one dish meal. I also think I remember that from another reviewer, thanks. The recipe I had was SO bland, but not this one, full of flavor! Oh, and I did put in mushrooms and it was wonderful!!! Thanks so much for the new addition to my recipe box. I am not a creative cook that throws in a pinch of this and a little of that, I cook strictly from recipies 80% of the time, so these reviews from everyone really help me. Thank you to EVERYONE!!!",

I like to cut my chicken breast into cubes while frozen since it's easier to cut and it makes less mess and let them thaw in fridge.  I added lemon pepper, garlic powder, a little salt and fresh ground black pepper to ziplock bag with chicken and tossed to coat.  I used one tbsp of butter and 2 tbsp of olive oil and sauteed chicken till just about cooked through.  In place of the bouillon and water I also used low sodium chicken broth.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken 99% fat free since I only had one can of each on hand.  I also diced up a small onion and added one can of mushrooms.  This turned out really good so thanks again Marion for a recipe that can be tweaked to everyones preference.",

I used boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into small pieces and seasoned with lemon juice, paprika, rosemary, thyme, oregano, minced garlic, and black pepper.  I also used whole wheat spaghetti, and one can cream of chicken and one cream of celery.  Preparing the soup according to the directions, I was worried that the dish would be too liquidy, but it was perfect.  SO flavorful and good!  As other reviewers have noted, it might be a little bland if you prepare it as written, without customizing with your favorite spices.  For me, the seasonings I used in baking the chicken worked out perfectly for seasoning the tetrazzini.  This is a recipe I'll definitely make again.  Thank you!",

To the soup mixture I added 1 small can of sliced mushrooms, 1/2 bag frozen peas, 2 TBS butter, about a teaspoon of garlic salt, 1 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, some seasoning salt, and about a tablespoon of dried parsley.  Cooked the soup mixture to heat then then added the cooked spaghetti right into the pot to mix.  Poured all into a baking dish - - topped with cheddar cheese and baked. I also took others advice to add buttered ritz cracker crumbs to the top - - I did this in the last 10 minutes of baking.  Overall turned out good - - You really need to dress this one up a bit - - I think it would be pretty plain without the extras.  My boys didn't like the cheddar cheese on top because it got a little hard -- next time maybe I'll mix the shredded cheese into the noodle mix before baking?",

I used fettucini noodles (broken in half) b/c I'm all out of spaghetti and the first thing I thought this dish needed was a little color from some veggies. When melting the butter (B4 adding the soups) I added some fresh/sliced mushrooms some chopped celery minced onion and some chopped green bell pepper. I sauted them for a few min until soft and then added the soup. Also I used 2c water and added 1/4c white wine. Finally when mixing it all together I added a jar of diced pimentos and a little more sharp cheddar cheese. Very basic recipe that allows you to easily add/subtract and the result was very tasty!
