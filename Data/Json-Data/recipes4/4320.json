I'm not very familiar or experienced with Tex-Mex or Mexican cooking and the seasonings used, but I do know what I like.  Going over the list of herbs and spices, hauling them out of the cabinet one by one, and then mixing them up all told me I was going to like this. The aroma was really wonderful, and it just looked, well, GOOD. My intention was to season some shrimp with this tomorrow but I was too curious to wait that long.  I seasoned up a hamburger with this wonderful stuff and grilled it for lunch. It took the boring ol' hamburger and made it something truly special.  Even tho' I'm not sure exactly what \"Adobo\" means or what it's used for, I still know that I can't wait to try this on other meats, chicken, rice, roasted potatoes or for  marinades .  As I started to make this I could have kicked myself because I had intended to make only half a recipe to start, to see if I liked it, but then realized I was dumping the full amounts into the mixing bowl. As it turned out my happy accident saved me the trouble of having to haul out all those spices again to make a second batch! Nice recipe, Traci. You got the combination and  balance just right!",

I am the submitter of this recipe and I want to say thanks to all of you who have tried my \"Adobo Seasoning\"   A few of you have mentioned the high amount of salt.  Yes the first ingredient in this is salt; this is what I found to be true in the the pre-packaged Adobo Seasonings I found in stores.  I omitted the additives/preservatives, anti-caking ingredients and MSG and found the simple ingredients were all we needed!  If you are sensitive to salt flavor or just can't have as much salt simply adjust the amount to your liking!  Thanks again and \"happy cooking\" :)",

Then I took another reviewers idea and put it on popcorn. Also amazing. I made a half batch this time but will double the recipe next time I make it.
