Veggies can turn out very mushy in a slow cooker and trying to split an uncooked spaghetti squash can be down right dangerous...so I decided to try this method using other submitter's suggestions. 1.) I used only 1/2 cup of water. 2.) Cooked on Low for 3 hrs., as soon as the squash was just tender to touch, I turned the slow cooker off and let the squash cool right in the cooker. It turned out perfect. So, easy to cut and shred. All of the strings came out easily and were not mushy at all. Maintained individual string texture.  This will be the way I cook spaghetti squash from now on.",

Yes, it was easy, but a slow cooker cooks with moist heat, and moist heat was not the best method for spaghetti squash, at least not for me.  Moist heat resulted in too-moist squash.  Not overdone at all mind you, but still almost on the soggy side - it simply retained too much moisture.  And I even used a lot less water than called for, just enough to cover the bottom of the pot.  Interesting to try, but I\u2019ll stick to roasting my spaghetti squash in the oven.",

This method of cooking the squash was sooooo easy, and when it was done cooking, cutting the squash was much simpler.  Some other reviewers said their squash was mushy, so I cut the water down to one cup.  Mine was not mushy at all!  It was perfect for for my twice baked casserole dish.
