This bread is the exact of opposite of all the other soft, fine-textured, preservative laden, over-priced supermarket breads. It's easiest if you use a stand-type mixer with bread hooks.  If you don't have one, buy one.  It'll be the most-used appliance in your kitchen, next to the toaster.",

The problem (if it was sticky) was probably not the yeast but the moisture content. Just add a bit of flour in and it'll come together just fine.  Obviously using bread flour is important since AP really won't work here. A little butter or egg wash over the top might help the appearance a bit.",
