However it is extremely soup-like and I am unsure if it is supposed to be that way. I thought this would be more of a sauteed vegetable dish with a little sauce. The texture wasn't an issue but the liquid was overwhelming. This would probably be better with the omission of the yellow zucchini (I used one large instead of two small) maybe one or two small potatoes and one tomato instead. I only used one hot pepper but the flavour and heat was lost in the dish. I added a little fresh spinach to the mix since I had some on hand. This makes alot definitely more than four servings. If I make it again I would halve the recipe. I think some onion and garlic would give this alot more flavour; and instead of slicing up the fried egg into the mixture it would be nice to top each serving with it and let each person blend it in or omit it if eggs with dinner aren't your thing. Potentially worthy of another try with modifications. EDIT After sitting overnight in the fridge and being re-heated for lunch this tastes way better and is a little less soup-y. I will definitely omit the yellow squash next time and use more spinach instead.",

The world cup idea and recipes such as this have definitely expanded our repertoire and encouraged us to experiment with spice and flavours. Harissa is scrumptious as is this dish! Highly recommended.",

First I cooked the harissa sauce with the veggies (I added some onion) and instead of cutting it all up I put the egg over the vegetables and wrapped up in a tortilla (I read somewhere that they served in a pita but a tortilla was what I had on hand). Also I omitted the chili peppers and dashed some cayenne and chili powder because my 2 year old was eating too. It was SUPER yummy and my husband liked it too. My 2 year old wasn't a fan but he's picky. So healthy!",
