I don't care for almond extract so I reduced it to 1/4 tsp. However I actually thought the mixture tasted much better before adding it. The almond meal gave it enough \"natural\" almond flavor which I prefer. I used a cookie scoop and they kept their shape. However they never seemed to dry out after baking or holding them in the oven for 8 hours. I had to finally freeze them to get them to hold shape. I thought they were okay but others found the almond extract flavor also too strong even though it was reduced. I got 18 total but most unfortunately most did go to waste.",
