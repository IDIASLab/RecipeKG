We've lived in NC since we've been married so he hasn't had his \"chicken corn soup fix!\" I found this recipe recently and it seemed easy enough so I gave it a try. I loooved it and my Husband had 3 bowls in one setting and said it tasted exactly how he remembered it! I followed the driections pretty much the way they are but I cut down on the cooking time by using chicken broth in place of water and using a rotisserie chicken (shredded). It was quick and easy. I loved the rivels and I think next time I will put more in. I'm also gonna take the advice of another reviewer and try adding in a can of cream corn to the mixture next time - although it is good without it!. This soup was very deilicious and I will most definitley be making it for years to come!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!",

Started with a mirepoix 1 onion 2 ribs celery 1 carrot sauted in 2 T. margarine for flavor and color. Added 1 large boneless skinless diced chicken breast 1 can of corn with liquid and 4 cups of water. Then used 4 teaspoons of chicken soup base Orrington Farms brand is excellent NAYY. Also added a little dry Thyme. Then for the rivals I used half whole wheat flour to make them healthier and added 1/2 teaspoon salt for flavor. My crumbles of dough were around pea size. I didn't use the hard cooked eggs. This soup was great...I love the rivals! I made a 3 quart pan full and only ate one little bowl because it's very filling. Thanks for the recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "I'm from Lancaster County and grew up eating chicken corn soup! This is a good recipe for it. Some people add carrots and some don't like the hard boiled eggs but NEVER potatoes to true chicken corn soup! For the rivels the \"dough\" should really be called batter. There is no mystery and almost no way to mess up. The dough should resemble a thick pancake batter. How big they are in your soup depends on how large a dough \"plop\" you use. They do not resemble \"balls\" while making them because the dough is too sticky to make a ball shape.They do make little balls when cooked though. But size is up to you. I've had large rivels and small ones. I personally like them about the size of a small marble when cooked. The easiest way I have found to get the rivels into the pot (because the dough/batter is sticky) is to first scoop up a level (or just a bit rounded) teaspoonful of the batter. Use your index finger against the edge of the spoon to push and cut off a bit of dough (whatever size you like) and it should stick to the fingerprint side of your index finger. Use the back of the spoon to then push the dough from your finger into the pot. (yes there is still more dough on the spoon but it won't fall off because it is sticky.) Keep pushing pieces of dough from the spoon. (about 6-8 rivels from one spoon of batter/dough) If it gets stuck to the back of the spoon touch the piece of dough to the hot soup. Once I can get in rhythm I can do all the rivels in about 5 minutes.",

                "reviewBody": "I made this last night but I think I must have done something wrong. I followed the instructions exactly but when the soup was finished it tasted greasy and had globs of grease from the chicken fat floating in the broth. In the past I've always chilled the stock from the chicken and removed the fat that floats to the top and hardens then used what was left. This recipe didn't call for that so I went with what the instructions said. We couldn't finish a bowl of it because of the greasy taste:-( I think I'll try this again one day but remove the grease from the stock first. It sounds like it has the potential to be a very good soup. Does anyone else have any ideas on why mine tasted so greasy? The chicken didn't seem to have an excess of fat on it.",
