The only thing that I would change on this is to add more sharp cheddar cheese. I love cheese and to me it didn't have enough sharp cheddar in it. I also didn't put in the 16 oz of sour cream and it wasn't soupy... very tasty tough and will be adding this to my recipe collection",

If you want to make it healthier(ha ha as if mac and cheese could ever be healthy!!!) use whole wheat macaroni lowfat cottage cheese lowfat sour cream reduced fat shredded cheddar....you seriously will NOT miss the extra fat it is just as yummy! Nothing better than a bowl of warm gooey good ole' mac and cheese!!!",
