However the shredded cheese just gets lost; I wouldn't even bother with that if I made again.

My bacon had a strong smoky flavor which overtook the wasabi so I would probably use less bacon or a milder bacon if I make this again. The wasabi really does add a yummy kick to this recipe. It is easy to put the thick filling back into the eggs with just a tablespoon.",
