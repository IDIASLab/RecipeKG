First, I lined the baking sheet with parchment paper (so cleanup was a breeze).  Also, rather than sprinkle the blueberries, and then the powdered sugar before rolling it up, I just tossed them both together before placing them on the croissants.  Make sure you seal it really well, otherwise the filling will leak.  These were really good right out of the oven... and I'm sure they'll also be wonderful for breakfast tomorrow!",
