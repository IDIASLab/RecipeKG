                "reviewBody": "LOVE this recipe. For the sake of my ears I omitted the chives (didn't want to hear little ones complaining there was green stuff in their crackers). I also upped the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp and instead of the hot sauce I used 1/4 tsp cayenne powder which gave it a slight kick at the end if you want some noticeable heat I'd use 1/2 tsp. It is fantastic and will definitely make this again. It turned out better than expected (I've tried a few of these types of recipes before and this one wins). Next time I will add some whole wheat flour. I rolled the mixture in some plastic wrap just put a pile on the plastic and close the wrap so none will escape then shape it into a log - don't be afraid so smush the mixture together it needs to hold together well in the fridge. When you slice it don't use a serated knife and don't saw the log just slice straight down some pieces may crumble but if you pack the mixture together well before you refridgerate it should be just fine.",

I used fresh chives chopped in the food pro which was quick & easy but a little slimy- made no difference in taste though so I'll do this again. I baked the first two rolls after refrigerating for 1 hour. I had to slice them thick but even then they kept crumbling apart. Make sure you squeeze the rolls tightly to compressed the mixture in the plastic wrap. I sprayed my sheet with Olive Oil and flattened with my hand as others suggested. I spinkled them with coarsely ground sea salt just before baking. They weren't even completely cooled before most of them were gone with my husband and kids around! What we did have leftover he said were even better and more like store bought the next day after the flavors settled. The next two rolls I sliced and baked after a couple days of refrigeration. With a sharp knife this made the slicing 10x easier because the rolls were so much more firm and I could slice them thinner like 1/8\" or less. And I'm sure I got more than 9 dozen. Thanks so much for this-- this was the first cracker recipe I tried but I don't need to search any further!:)",

I was hoping this was it but it's not. The chives are too overpowering and these don't have the spicy kick the ones at the party had. I even doubled the hot sauce and garlic to suit our tastes but all you can taste is cheese and chives. Needs a bit more salt too. My first batch stuck to the pan so I sprayed the pan after that. These are ok not great not terrible. A good jumping off point with a little tweaking this could be 5 stars.",

Use finely shredded extremely sharp WHITE cheddar cheese (I have to buy blocks and shred by hand). B. Melt the butter C. Sift the flour D. and lastly I don't form into a roll or refridgerate. The dough is warm from the melted butter and I've found it best to just squeeze it into 1\" balls in my hand and then press it down on a cookie sheet with the bottom of a flat cup. Make sure the bottom is completely flat and not dished. I also dip the cup into flour between crackers so it doesn't stick. I never have leftovers...",

I added more salt garlic powder grated parmesan cheese and cayenne pepper.I also baked it til they were very brown.This was so much better!!! These spread out a little while baking so leave a little room on the sheet. I baked these on parchment paper.They taste similar to the boxed name brand cheese crackers!So now I changed it from 3 stars to 4 stars!",
