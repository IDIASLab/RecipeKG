Changes we made: 1) didn't have oyster sauce so used some soy - that tasted fine. 2) Didn't add additional fresh or frozen corn just the creamed corn we had been given and needed to use up (I've got an intolerance for corn so though I eat some I don't pile it on when I do) 3) Sauteed an onion before making the soup and included that in the soup... 4) offered chopped left over beef or pork....... yum! Changes I might try next time: a) might use frozen corn instead of creamed corn b) might saute celery garlic and ginger with the onion c) might include chicken or fish. // My two youngest children ate this and ate this and ate this until it was all gone. Hubs enjoyed this as did I. Our second oldest son didn't care for one of our substitutions (the soy sauce). I don't know if he'll enjoy this more with the oyster sauce called for in the recipe. Will try to have some on hand for next time. Thanks again! - well 2nd son doesn't love the oyster sauce either. We prefer the soy....??? go figure.... perhaps we just enjoyed that first meeting of this soup and look forward to it just like that??? Thanks either way!",
