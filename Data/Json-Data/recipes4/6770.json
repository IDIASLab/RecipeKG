First, the serving size as recommended results in very, very tiny servings.   That\u2019s because this is a Weight Watcher recipe that\u2019s been slightly altered.  The second thing worth mentioning is that if you make this in a crock pot, be prepared for it to be over done and the sweet potatoes turned to mush, especially if you dice the potatoes and pork  in the recommended cube size.   I personally do not use the crock pot when making this.  I put everything in a heavy pot, cover, and let it simmer on med-high heat on the stove.  It\u2019s ready to go in less than an hour and to keep the sweet potatoes from getting too soft, I chop them in larger pieces.",

We served this over rice with cilantro & a dollop of sour cream. Would be great in tacos or with tortilla chips. If I were to make it again, I'd likely add onion or chives, more salt & more lime-citrusy flavor. Also, I think it would be better baked in the oven so that the meat and potatoes would crisp up.",

I did read the reviews befotehand and added a little extra seasoning to it as well as a chopped green bell pepper.... and chopped the sweet potatoes into larger 1\" cubes so they didnt get mushy. I was short on time but still wanted to use my slow cooker so I did 3 hours on high then turned it down to low for the last hour. The pork was tender and the potatoes were perfect. I served it like a stew over jasmine rice.",
