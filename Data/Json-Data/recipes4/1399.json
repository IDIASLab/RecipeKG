With the exception of using less oregano (just sprinkled a bit over the flour-dredged chicken) and adding a couple of cloves of fresh, minced garlic with the mushroom mixture, I prepared this exactly as written. Colorful presentation, perfect blend of flavors. I served this with penne pasta and additional sauteed fresh spinach as sides.  Outstanding recipe!",

I thought it was good - Although the marsala (I used a dry marsala) was a little too overpowering -next time I would use 1/2 C to 3/4 C - not a whole cup.  I would use a little more mushrooms and sundried tomatoes.   I would use less butter (my god, 3/4 of a cup??) and I would use more spinach.  Actually, I did use more spinach - the recipe calls for 1/2 cup and I used about 2 cups. This will probably taste even better tomorrow, so the flavors have a chance to \"marry\" overnight - I probably would make it again, but next time I would:\nuse more portabello mushrooms, more sundried tomatoes, more spinach, less butter and less marsala.  This recipe has all the ingredients for an excellent dish - the amounts of the ingredients just need to be tweeked a little bit.",

I followed the recipe pretty closely, using less butter, added more mushrooms & minced garlic.  I added the wine and about 2/3 cup of chicken stock to the pan with the mushrooms and tomatoes, reduced for about ten minutes, then added a good amount of rough chopped fresh spinach, and finished with a splash of heavy cream.  Placed the chicken back in the pan with sauce while hubby and I finished happy hour.  Yummy!  Will make this many more times.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

I made 3 small changes that made the dish perfect for us: I added about 1 teaspoon minced garlic with the mushrooms. I stirred in about 1/2 c. cream when I added the spinach (makes it smooth, creamy and richer). And I also put the chicken back into the gravy to simmer once the mushrooms were tender, for about 15 minutes. Our only Chicken Marsala recipe from now on!",
