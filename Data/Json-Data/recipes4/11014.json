I love spinach so this was right up my alley and the tortellini was a nice twist as well! I made a few variations---limited the onions and celery just because I'm not a huge fan. I did use fresh spinach instead of frozen and it worked just fine. Instead of meat I used a three cheese tortellini and omitted the egg noodles (too much pasta). Finally I didn't go through the trouble of taking the chicken off the bone (thought it made the soup more \"hearty\" and it falls right off anyway) and I also added a couple teaspoons of butter. All in all---this was a fantastic recipe! I served it with garlic bread and it tasted event better for lunch the next day!!!",
