But I would add more next time) and I had a bag of precut broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, which I microwaved and threw in there at the end. I didn't have any red pepper flakes in my cupboard, but found some packets of red pepper flakes that we got from a pizza joint and poured those in there! Gotta improvise sometimes! Also, after we had eaten our dinner, my husband said that next time I should add some peanuts!Thanks for this delicous low carb recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "Our level of heat tolerance in this house lies somewhere between coward and wimp. So I ll start by saying that our Spicy Garlic and Pepper Shrimp wasn t nearly as spicy or peppery as the submitter intended as I cut waaay back on the red pepper flakes (ok I hardly used any at all). I have made this in the past using packaged coleslaw mix but this time I used some napa cabbage I had on hand. Hard to say which I liked better! The coleslaw mix obviously has a stronger flavor but I did like the tenderness and lightness of the napa cabbage. I used red onion for a spark of color and even threw in a little radicchio which also contributed interest and color. I love this stuff it s a nutritious fantastic meal you can put on the table in minutes so make sure you start your rice in advance! Four stars rather than five only because I think the amount of crushed red pepper flakes is excessive not just for the heat factor but because it may detract from rather than enhance the flavors of the shrimp and cabbage.",

I thought that sounded like too much so I cooked it with only 1 tablespoon. That was more than enough! Next time I make this because it was good other than being a little too hot I will use 1/2 tablespoon of red pepper flakes for 4 servings. Other modifications: I cut way back on the vegetable oil used an entire head of cabbage and 1lb shrimp for 4 servings left out the cilantro (didn't have any on hand) and garnished it with green onion and toasted sesame seeds. Peanuts would make a great garnish too.",
