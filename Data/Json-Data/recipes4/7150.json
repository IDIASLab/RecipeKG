Of course it took a lot of trial and error to get it right because she was from the 'handful of this and a pinch of that' school of cooking. You can use milk or plain yogurt in place of the buttermilk. Shortening or butter can stand in for the lard. Serve with butter, jelly, honey, gravy, or whatever your favorite biscuit topping is.",

I have made it three different times the first with the standard recipe second substituting 1/4 cup flower with whole wheat and the third substituting 1 cup flower with whole wheat (a much stronger whole wheat taste but still good). They are more dense (perhaps because of the lard) but i love them and so does everyone else. When ever i make them the roommates hang around waiting for them to finish and grab the first biscuit. I made them with gravy (excellent) and without eating them with butter and jam (excellent). The recipe only makes about 7-9 depending on the size i wouldn't call them \"big-as-cat-head\" they serve 2-3 people (maybe 4 if you are all light eaters/depending on what else you are eating) so for a group i would double the recipe.",
