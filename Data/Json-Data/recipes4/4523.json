I added quite a bit of water to get it to mix with the pasta and veggies but consistency is all about personal preference. I also added some extra salt and pepper as well as broccoli. The zucchini was delish but I imagine most veggies go well with this entree. All-in-all great. I will be making this again!",

For that I found a substitute using 4 oz. cream cheese 3 T sour cream and 2 T heavy whipping cream. Also I did not use the pasta cooking water in the sauce; I used just plain water instead. This recipe made a huge batch of pasta so I froze some of it. I've since eaten the frozen leftovers and they cooked up well in a little bit of milk.",

Specifically the quality of the parmesan. Did not have basil so used oregano (sparingly). Sauted the garlic added some white wine once the cheese sauce was added to the garlic then the pasta. Also cooked the pasta in boiling water with a few chicken boullion cubes added. Used that to add to the sauce. Also used a bit more pepper. Next time will saute shallots and garlic.",
