Well I've made this three times now and it's never looked like the big ole hunk of pooey that's pictured. I do have some recommendations: use a loaf pan double the gaahlic and I sometimes spice it up with ground pepperoni in the beef or add mushrooms to the cheese. It's also VERY important to use lean beef or you end up draining all the cheese along with the grease.",

You can even prepare it (not bake) in the morning or night before and store it the fridge until it's time to cook it. You do need to cook a little longer since you are starting with very cold ingredients. Update: I just made this again last night. The original recipe that I have has 2 cloves of garlic and 3/4 tsp of oregano. It also uses shredded mozzerella in the middle and slices on the top. Wonderful recipe! I'm glad it's on here.",

Rather than ending up with one large loaf I've made rolls of 5x3 - 5x5 inches. Using one piece of ham and cheese rolled then breaded then fried in a skillet. This is more of what I've been accustomed to having in Sicily. Nonetheless the taste in either format is divine and delicious.",
