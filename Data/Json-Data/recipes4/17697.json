I drained a bit of the water from the pan added the chopped figs to the noodles tasted it and there was little to no flavor just a hint of sweetness. Knowing I wouldn t enjoy it as is and most likely it would go down the garbage disposal I then added the seasoning and found that zing that I was looking for. I thought the Oriental taste was a good partner to the fresh figs. Sorry Chef Lizzie for being the first reviewer and changing your recipe but I m giving it four stars with this modification and I would make it again.",
