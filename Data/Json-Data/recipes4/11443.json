My family cooks and measures the same way \"a little of that... a pinch of that,\" etc.  Made it extremely difficult for me to perfect my family's  tortilla recipe. I was very happy so see your measurements for the ingredients, I had been experimenting for a few months.  The only thing I would add is \u00bd teaspoon of baking soda. \n\nDon\u2019t forget to follow the instructions.  Mix the shorting with the dry ingredients well and make sure the mixture is consistent before adding the water.  I recommend adding \u00bd  of the water first and knead it a little bit, then add the remaining water and knead again. I tried this recipe twice, the first time I was lazy and put all the ingredients in at the same time and paid for it when my tortillas came out hard.  The second time with a little patience-- they were perfect.  For those of you who have to try this more than once, it\u2019s normal-- flour tortillas are tricky.  You might want to start by making 6 (1/3 of the recipe).  In step three she uses the word \u201cfry\u201d, but it doesn\u2019t mean use oil, she means cook it by putting on a frying pan (best if it\u2019s a non-stick pan) or a skillet.  Good luck!",

                "reviewBody": "These came out to perfection! I used these in Quesadillas... and it gave them the perfect homemade Mexican touch. I was very impressed. Just a couple of things I wanted to mention. First of all, the directions are a bit confusing. It sounds like you are supposed to let it cook for 10 seconds (at which point you should see a bubble form) and then you should immediately flip it, letting it cook for 30 seconds... and then flip one more time, letting it cook for yet another 30 seconds. This is incorrect. Here is what you do. Place the tortilla on the griddle and let it sit until you see a bubble form (this can be up to a minute). As soon as you see the bubble, flip it, and let it sit for another 30 seconds. Immediately after you drop the tortilla on the griddle you should already begin rolling out your next one. You should be finished rolling it out by the time both sides of the first one are cooked. One more thing... the surface needs to be more than \"lightly floured\". If you are not careful, the tortilla will get stuck to your surface, and you will have to begin all over again. Make sure both sides of the tortilla are well floured, and you won't have any problems. All in all, great recipe!",

For this recipe I did the all white flour and used my food processor to mix the shortening with the flour. I followed the rest of the recipe as written but used only 1 Tbsp of salt. I made a few different batches within the 1 to 8 hour resting period and they all turned out equally well. Thank you Claudia for sharing this recipe!!!",
