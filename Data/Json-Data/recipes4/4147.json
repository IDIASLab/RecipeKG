I used \"Idahoan Roasted Garlic\" mashed potato mix which is better tasting than many of the others. I ended up having enough to cover two lbs of meat, but they are so good that was fine with me. Next time I will cut the salt back to 1 & 1/2 teaspoon, but other than that I love these! Thank you for posting. :-)\nPS  I used a light olive oil, worked great.\n**Update, just made for second time.  Added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder & 1/4 cup parmesan cheese to the flakes.  They were even better.  After removing chicken, you can pour the left over milk in the frying pan, add flour & make gravy.  Yum.",
