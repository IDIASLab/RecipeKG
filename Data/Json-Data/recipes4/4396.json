The next time i made this i used season salt, cajun, and italian seasoning...It was even better!! Oh and another review said it took twice to three times longer to bake- this can be true depending on the size of the bird. I cooked mine at the temp it said for as long as it said and well it was sooo not done. I jacked up the heat to 400 and cooked for another 40min MUCH BETTER!",

However, the salt content is extremely high and was overpowering if you ate the skin of the chicken (and I only used half of the seasoning mixture) and I had a larger chicken.  I would reduce the amount of salt (seasoned & regular).  Chicken was very moist!  I did mine in the oven, but will try sometime on the grill also.  Will be using the carcass for making stock.",
