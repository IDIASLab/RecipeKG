After the mashed potato mixture had cooled I also added some shredded cheddar cheese and eliminated the extra egg yolk to the mix (didnt think it needed it). Floured egged and breaded these babies and cooked until golden on both sides. Very tasty. I made 8 large croquetts. This recipe would be great with different cheeses. Will definately make again! One last note loved the spinach addition to this recipe. A great way to incorporate veggies!",

Everyone who ate these tonight liked them except me. The insides were too mushy like mashed potatoes. I certainly found that the parmesan and spinach helped thicken but not enough. I had even added a little canned corn more (very well squeezed dry) spinach than called for minced onions and garlic! The garlic smelled awesome in it. I even had put the on-a-sheet-to-cool-potatoes in a preheated oven (to 250C then turned off) for a good 20 minutes to dry the potatoes as much as I could before cooling them down. Maybe its supposed to be a little mushy on the inside though. (??) Also I found the smaller I made the balls the better they fried up. I used tongs rather than a slotted spoon.",
