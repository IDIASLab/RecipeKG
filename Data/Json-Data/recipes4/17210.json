I modified it a bit to include my own tomatoes put up from my garden and beef broth rather than water and bouillon. Normally I add a good sprinkle of Parmesan cheese at serving but not with this cheese tortellini and its bold flavor. Just as the soup was improved using a good broth rather than bouillon so would a soup pasta rather than the tortellini. I may throw this quick soup together again in the future particularly since it easily makes use of ingredients I readily have available but with these simple substitutions.",

The tomato, zucchini & mushroom make it healthy and vibrant, and the sausage and pasta make it somewhat decadent.  I did use beef broth instead of bouillon, but bouillon will take up less room in your shopping cart.  The parmesan sprinkled on top (I use Parmigiano Reggiano from Italy) and crusty bread are essential, don't skip them!  Oh... and if you make this in the crock pot, boil the pasta separately and put some in a bowl and pour the soup over before serving.  Tortellini get soggy fast over continuous heat.",
