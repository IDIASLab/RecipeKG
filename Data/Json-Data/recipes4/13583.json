I also added a splash of soy sauce and used chicken broth instead of water and bullion cubes.  It tasted like fried rice!  I have tried and tried to make fried rice, and it never comes out right.  This is the way to do it.  Next time I'm going to add some veggies and more soy to make it even more like fried rice.  Save a LOT of fat by cutting out the olive oil completely.
