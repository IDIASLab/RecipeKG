I bought one of those 12 oz. bags of broccoli florets from the produce department so I didn't have to cut anything - just dumped on the sheet, tossed w/ the oil (1 TB was plenty) and s&p, and 18 min. at 400 deg. was just about perfect! Adding a sprinkle of parmesan at the table was magic, but on its own, just as wonderful and simple of a side dish. I normally steam my broccoli in the microwave w/ butter, lemon juice, s&p, but this was absolutely delicious and something that I'm sure I'll do again and again!",
