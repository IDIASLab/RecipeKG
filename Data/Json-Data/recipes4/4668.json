Finely minced carrot and fresh herbs are a nice addition to this soup; I add the carrots in with the onions in the extra-virgin olive oil at the start, and the fresh chopped herbs (parsley, cilantro, fresh mint, or whatever the creatures in the garden haven't devoured) just before serving as a garnish. My family prefers this with common brown lentils, but Umbrian or red lentils would work well here too. We have this soup with thin slices of baguette and a salad tossed with balsamic dressing.",

I've made a ton of good lentil soup recipes from this website (\"Apricot Lentil Soup\", \"Lentil Soup\", \"Moroccan Lentil Soup\" to name a few) and this one is just as good as the others.  Only a couple of minor changes:  I didn't add the dried onion and dried parsley, I added fresh.  I also added two finely chopped carrots and celery stalks to the soup.  I couldn't figure out 1/2 lb, so I just added 1 1/2 cups of dried lentils.   I also added about 3 tbsp of tomato paste. It turned out more soupy because I added an extra couple of cups of broth.  The wine added a ton of unexpected flavor.  It tasted almost lemony.  Excellent soup and I'll definitely add it to my lentil soup rotation!",
