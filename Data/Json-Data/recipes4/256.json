Used 1.5 lbs ground beef (since it was packaged that way), 1.5 cups salsa since that was all I had, black beans instead of chili beans for a little added mexican flare, 2 cups crused tortillas, no olives (can't stand em), and 1 can diced tomatoes, drained. GREAT TURN OUT!!! A few things, though... I agree with another reviewer that 3 cups is definitely too much for the tortilla chips. The 2 cups I used was too much. I'll only use about 1.5 cups next time. Also, my diced tomatoes were canned with basil and garlic, and I didn't care much for the flavor with this casserole (although it was mild enough that I still gobbled it up), so I'll remember to have just some regular diced tomatoes on hand from now on. And, if you like green onion, don't skimp on it here. The flavor really goes well in this dish; I mean, out of this world. MMMMM... Of course, as others suggested, I browned the ground beef with onion and taco seasoning (I added this WHILE the meat browned, not after, but either way would probably work fine). As always, I used all organic ingredients and followed the layering just as specified in the recipe. This dish is a knockout! Thanks so much for sharing it.",

I used corn tortillas on the bottom instead of torilla chips, and layered the ingredients in 2 layers, like a lasanga, hoping it would hold together better.  I used one layer of corn and another of flour torillas.  I used a blend of cheese (\"mexican style\") and low fat sour cream, added an additional can of chili beans, and used ground turkey instead of beef.  I also added a green pepper, an onion and green chilis and some more spices, as many reviewers said it was bland.  It wasn't spicy at all so next time I'll add more to it.  It still was pretty tasty and a hearty meal with a nice salad.",

Nice paired with a salad tossed with southwestern ranch dressing.  A good recipe to customize to your own taste.
