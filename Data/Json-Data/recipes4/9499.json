I didn't think I made the cookies very big and my yield was still only 23 cookies not 30. I used all the right ingredients (my flour was unbleached though). I baked the first dozen for 20 minutes and they didn't look too done so the next batch baked for 23 and was better. I'll probably make this again soon and try for 25 minutes. But then again I live at 6200 feet so maybe that's why. These cookies are pretty mild and light. Maybe a little too floury though. Pretty easy and basic and I'm sure with some expert tweaking they could be very good in my opinion.",
