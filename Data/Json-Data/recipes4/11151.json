Not for the faint of heart but then again if you are a spice wimp you probably aren't going to attempt a recipe called spicy rice to begin with:) Someone commented on the lack of flavor I thought it had excellent flavor. I did add some minced garlic to the step where the onion and vegetables are sauteed and also seasoned this step with salt and pepper. As for the seasoning of the meat we used the recommended season salt for the chicken and added some pepper but used garlic salt and pepper for the beef. The meat had excellent flavor and was very tender. My only \"beef\" with the recipe is that it seemed to take much longer to prepare than it states. It is a very easy recipe not strenuous but the step where the rice is supposed to brown alone in the pan seems to take longer than anticipated. The rice is/was slightly mushy as well. Not sure why that was. It still had excelled flavor and that would not stop us from making the recipe again.",
