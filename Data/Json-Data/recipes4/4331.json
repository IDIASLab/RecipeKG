I season my fillets with either Penzey's Northwoods Seasoning or Penzey's Jerk seasoning and while it's baking, I make up a quick home-made Alfredo Sauce with 1/4 cup of butter, some fresh garlic, 1/2 cup of half & half, 3/4 cup good Parmesan (grated) and a little Italian seasoning.  (Just saute the garlic in the butter over med/high heat, then add the other ingredients, stirring until blended.)  This recipe is definitely a keeper - thanks for a new way to serve up Tilapia!",

By the time the sauce was ready to top the fish the shrimp were perfectly cooked.  Who needs to go out to eat.  This is fare fit for a king.",

I bake my tilapia the same way, but have never added a topping.  I did take Westie Mom's advice and made my own alfredo sauce as I don't care for the jarred stuff.  I followed her recipe for the sauce which is:  1/4 C butter, fresh minced garlic, 3/4 C parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup half and half and a bit of Italian seasoning.  It was perfect!  I actually used 2 T fat free half and half and 2 T heavy cream because this is what I had.  Do yourself a favor and make this sauce!  You only need a couple tablespoons for each piece of fish so it is worth the splurge!  Thanks for a great recipe!",
