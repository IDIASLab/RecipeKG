The recipe is very forgiving too - I missed the bit about kneading after mixing all of the ingredients together so I mixed and let rise for an hour. The dough rose nicely and I kneaded a bit before the second rise in the pans. Baked up perfectly at 375 for 35 min. When I make this again (and I will!) I'll leave out the anise. It was a nice flavor, but I'd like to try it without for a little more versatility in pairing. I'm sure other herb additions would work well too.",
