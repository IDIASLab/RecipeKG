I use Morningstar Farms Veggie Crumbles in place of the TVP simply because I couldn't find the TVP. Everything is is exactly the same- especially the spices and the honey. I think this recipe hits the spices just perfect! Also I brown the onion garlic and veggie crumble add half the spices in a big skillet. Once that is done I transfer it to the slow cooker add the rest of the ingredients and then let it cook on high for 3-4 hours. SO EASY! I always double the recipe and freeze the rest because it freezes and reheats well for quick mid-week dinners. THANK YOU for posting this recipe. It is my favorite!",

I used Boca Burgers instead of the TVP (2 of them for 6 servings) by saut\u00e9ing them with the onions and garlic and adding a bit more olive oil. Also this recipe is pretty spicy so only use 1/2 of the cayenne pepper if you're not into hot food. Topping it with shredded taco cheese and adding some whole grain rice to the mix turns this into a great hearty meal!",
