Also I cooked mine a lot longer since I wanted them really crunchy - I just bumped the timer in 3 minute increments. They have a very earthy flavor and pair well with hummus. Next time I'll experiment with different seeds and such.

I'm taking this batch to a party so I'm glad of it but I'll probably half the recipe if I make it again for at home. The spices don't really pop so if I make this again I'll probably increase them or add herbs/salt as a topping. Make sure to roll the dough super thin.

I baked them more than the suggested 8 minute--baked them until they were just beginning to brown at the edges because I wanted them really crisp.
