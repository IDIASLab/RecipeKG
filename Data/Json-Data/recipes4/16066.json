The beans cooked most of the day and night because I like using the low setting.  I mashed some when done to add creamy texture.

He was scared at first and questioned...everything...but after two bowls he said it was the best red beans and rice he's ever had!  That's right...I impressed the big guy.  The entire house smelled wonderful! ****I soaked the beans overnight in water so that they'd be good and ready on time! I also substituted chicken broth for the water.  That's it!  Did everything according to the directions.  It's a little bland for our taste but perfect for the kids and all we had to do was add salt and hot sauce to it in our own bowls.  Served over white rice...of course...along with corn bread.  Awwww yeah...",

I added some salt and pepper after the cooking was done as instructed but didn't need to add nearly as much as I thought I would.
