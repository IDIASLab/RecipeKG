The chops browned very nicely--NONE of the breading fell off at all, which pleased me a great deal. When I made the \"gravy\", I used fat free evaporated milk (and I did use a little more than asked for--a full \"soup can\" for a little thinner gravy) only because I like the flavor that it gives to the recipe and it works better as a cooking milk. I added a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce to the \"gravy\". I served this with fluffy rice and garlic broccoli. Great comfort food, very similar to something Mom used to make for me when I was a kid.",

I drained the oil from the pan I cooked the chops in then added the soup mixture. That way you get all the flavor from the yummy drippings. So you have the bowl from the eggs the frying pan and the baking dish. Not too bad!:) if you want more gravy just make a simple gravy with flour and chicken stock then add the soup mixture. My son ate it up really fast!:)",
