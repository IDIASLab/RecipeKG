Used the same shortcuts that others mentioned-- corned beef from deli 2c of cole slaw mix 1c of precooked/bagged shredded potatoes. Also I did not fry them. Once I wrapped them up I misted them with a bit of non-stick cooking spray and placed on a cookie sheet.....then baked for 18 minutes @ 425 degrees. A bit healthier than the deep-frying method but tastes at least as good IMHO.",

I use a large Ziploc freezer bag and place each ingredient in the bag in layers, then shake vigorously to blend.  (It makes it easy to scoop out portions with a measuring cup.)\n3. Have a wet paper towel ready to use as the \"sealer\" when you're about to close up the egg roll.\n\nI also forego the deep-fry method and do the spray-with-Pam-and-bake-at-400\u00baF method.  \n\nMy favorite \"dipping\" sauce is a horseradish mustard; my kids seem to prefer just mustard. \n\nThanks for a FANTASTIC recipe!!!",

I also used a rhubarb/ginger jam for a dipping sauce which added a hint of sweetness to the egg roll. Either way it's a great recipe and will now become a part of my regular collection...Thanks!",
