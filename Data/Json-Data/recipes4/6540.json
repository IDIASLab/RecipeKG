I also subbed golden mushroom condensed soup for one of the cans of soup per the suggestion of another reviewer. My hubby who \"doesn't care for Velveeta \" raved about this and asked for leftovers for lunch the next day. Not something we'd eat every week but a darn tasty way to use up leftover ham.",
