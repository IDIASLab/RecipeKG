My Cajun Grandmother (who was an AMAZING cook) always said the best rule of thumb for making a gumbo roux is 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup flour, 8 cups stock. So when I read this recipe I was shocked at the amount of oil, flour and stock that was called for. Goodness me...that would be some THICK, greasy stuff!!! So I followed the recipe except for those amounts. It was pretty good. Great way to use some of our leftover turkey. :-)",
