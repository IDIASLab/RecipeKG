First of all, the filling and sauce is only for eight or less Manicotti shells. There were 14 shells in my 8 oz pkg. If you were going to go through all that work, you might as well double the filling and the sauce and make two trays. The filling was good, but the sauce lacked something. It was rather bland. Very unlikely I will make this again.",
