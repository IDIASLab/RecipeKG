The initial 4c of liquid was split between water and broth, for flavor. When I added all ingredients to pot, I subbed rosemary, black pepper, and no-salt seasoning in for bay leaves. I added spices again at halfway point. I simmered for 1hr 30m and the liquid had disappeared so I added 2c broth at the same time as the rice and all was good after the last 15m of summer time.

I'm not sure but I believe if you bring it to a boil a little more slowly really letting it take it's time then the chicken might come out a little more shredded? Either way the chicken was tender and delicious. I changed the recipe and added frozen peas increased chicken to almost 2 lbs of chicken breast chopped and added one chicken bouillon cube. It was scrumptious and it did come out as a stew. I will definitely be making this again. I would add a picture except the picture just looks like well chicken stew.
