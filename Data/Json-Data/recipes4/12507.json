While cooking I left a bit more bacon grease in, and I also added chiken bouillon to the 2 cups of water. To top it off I sprinkled shredded chedder cheese on the top and let it melt a little before serving. I will not be looking for another corn chowder recipe, this is the best.",

Have tried various corn chowder recipes before (usually with chicken) and never cared for them but the bacon was just right! Be sure not to skip the step of lightly browning the potatoes and onions with the bacon and drippings as I think this really develops the flavors. Will probably try it with milk instead of the half-and-half and may possibly try reducing the salt but otherwise this is a wonderful recipe. Thanks for sharing!",
