First, the beef must be really well browned &ndash; I'm talking deep, dark, crusty, and caramelized. The other key step is easier. To paraphrase an expression, 'stick a fork in them, they're done.' Just braise them until they're fork-tender. After browning properly, the only way to mess these up is to undercook them, so don't.",

It is \"Julia Child-esque\" in its simple elegance and richness. \n\nTwo firsts for me:\n\nThis recipe compelled me to write my first ever review (can't believe this recipe doesn't have one!) And...\n\nThis was my first time eating short ribs let alone cooking them. I am a chronic, habitual recipe tweaker, but this time I refrained. The only changes I made were the serving size--I cook for 2 and these are rather expensive--and I did do them in the crock pot. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written and thickened the gravy a bit at the end with a flour slurry. The gravy is rich and delicious and had so much of it left over I froze for later. Served with scratch made mashed potatoes and steamed baby carrots in a lemon chive butter.\n\nNext time I plan to do them on a weekend and use the Dutch oven. I bet they'll be even better! (Also plan to use this recipe for a roast) Thanks Chef John!",

I will mention that I learned braising meant cooking the meat in broth that only covers 1/2 way up the ribs. Otherwise, covering the ribs to the top or over is actually boiling it. 4 quarts of broth was too much. 2 quarts was perfect. But towards the end I did put the rest of the broth in because I threw in carrots and Yukon gold potatoes. I'm no expert but it worked well for me. The meat fell off the bones when I was transferring it. This recipe takes a long time but it was great.",

The next day all the fat came to the surface and I was easily able to de-fat and discard, then resumed braising til totally fork tender, maybe another half hour.  Served them with mashed potatoes and roasted carrot rounds and my family RAVED about them.  I highly recommend this two day process if you're trying to limit the fat in your diet.

It wasn't cheap but the flavour and the way it made our house smell was reminiscent of Sunday family dinners when I was growing up.  I made it exactly as laid out in the recipe except I forgot to \"bring ribs mixture to a simmer\" before putting it in the oven.  For us, I think Chef John's timing worked better.  I left it in for the extra hour as several reviewers stated and it was fall off the bone delicious but we prefer ours still on the bone like he has it in the video.  We served it over homemade mashed potatoes with thyme roasted beets.  It was simple, straightforward, tasted unbelievable and SO worthy of company.  As Chef John says \"Enjoy\"......you will!",
