It says after you add in the celery and peppers to turn the heat up to high and stir occasionally. I ended up burning them so badly that they were black and stuck to my pan my smoke alarm went off and even with all the windows open it still took a few hours to \"dehaze\" my house. The next time I only turned it to the low side of med-high and it still almost burned and I had to stir it a LOT! But in the end it tasted AMAZING and we all loved it!! It was really easy and the outcome was delicious! Its worth the effort I would just recommend not turning the heat up past med-high.",

The main change is to make a roux (flour browned in oil) instead of using cornstarch. Cornstarch changes the texture and also does not add the deep flavor a roux does. The other change is more minor - butter instead of margarine and also the amount cut to one stick of butter. I've made it with two sticks and it is unnecessary. Still a good recipe nonetheless.",

This forms a roux the essential building block of etoufee. I'd also add 1/2 cup white wine and a good amount (3 tablespoons ) of Tabasco or Crystal hot sauce. Garnish with thinly sliced green onions and serve with garlic bread. Making these quick changes to the recipe results in a 5 star recipe that's much closer to the real deal in Louisiana.",
