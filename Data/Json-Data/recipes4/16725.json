The flavors blend very nicely into a new combination that is not dominated by any one ingredient. I modified the recipe only by adding less water to keep it from being to \"soupy\". Instead of the 2 quarts of water (10 cups) I added only 5 cups. I am not really sure what purpose the ground beef provides and I may leave it out of future meals and substitute bulgar or an additional cup of freekeh with appropriate addition of water. The dish is moderately spicy and one could alter that by the number of Serrano peppers or Cayenne. It freezes well for future enjoyment.",
