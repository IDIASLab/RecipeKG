For example, I don't like mushrooms, but I don't give recipes a bad review if it calls for them...I just leave them out of the recipe. Wow.  I'm in the minority here, but personally I read reviews to find out about the recipe I \"click\" on, not to see other people using it as a way to get their recipe \"out there\"...no time for that...sorry:(",

The only thing I did different than in the recipe is I added the cheese to the white sauce and melted it in after taking off burner before adding to pasta.  I also doubled recipe.  Just for some little extra something I took tbsp of butter melted, half sleeve of saltines and three strips of crisp bacon and crumbled all together in my food processor and added to the top.  That topping was the perfect compliment to the cheeses used in the recipe.  I also made this the night before.  Next afternoon put in oven at recommended cooking temp and added about 15 minutes to cooking time, but came out perfect so definitely a dish u can prepare ahead and bake later.",

I did 2 cups of cheese (1 cup pepperjack, 1 cup cheddar) mixed into the sauce and then topped the mac and cheese with 1/2 cup of cheddar and baked.  the processed cheese food was not a good addition.  I found it was much better with just cheddar and pepperjack.",
