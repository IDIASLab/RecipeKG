I've made it before with very large avocados and it came out gooey. (We actually used that batch to melt pieces of it into milk for the most amazing creamy hot cocoa!) And if your avocados are too tiny it will be harder as one reviewer found. If all your grocery store has is very small avocados I might use 2 1/2 or 3. PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU SEE GREEN IN YOUR FUDGE AT ALL THEN YOU HAVE NOT MADE THIS RECIPE CORRECTLY!!! The avocado should be FULLY incorporated and the fudge should be completely smooth with no lumps.",

I made sure most people tried it before asking them to guess the secret ingredient. People were guessing raisins dates nuts etc. and then someone finally said \"avocado?\" and I couldn't help but grin. The only difficult part was blending the avocados because one wasn't ripe enough. It is critical to use ripe avocados for this! Mixing in the cocoa was a bit challenging but surprisingly became easier as the confectioner's sugar was added. The fudge became very dark and thick in the end and I used an 8x8 pan with wax paper instead of a 9x11. I refrigerated the fudge overnight and then ran the bottom of the glass pan under hot water and used a spatula to get it! The Irish cream (I used Bailey's) gives it a great flavor!",

The slightly Irish Cream flavor is very unique but my favorite part is that it uses avocado instead of marshmallow cream AND you don't need a candy thermometer. I also like that it uses cocoa powder instead of a ton of chocolate chips. I can tell you grew up outside of the US and have learned to adapt to available ingredients! Thanks a lot!",
