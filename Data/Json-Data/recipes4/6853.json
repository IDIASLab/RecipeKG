I did simmer long.\" I like to let the house absorb the warm smell of chili and couldn't let this simply simmer for 15-20 min. so after checking on it at 30 min., found it way too thick and goopy (due to very little liquid that went it), so I added some water. I liked the addition of stewed tomatoes, rather than diced, along w/ the directive to cut the onion and bell pepper into a larger 1/2\" dice. Made it look really chunky and pretty, and my DD was able to pluck out what she didn't necessarily want to eat in each bite. A nice, simple chili; nothing made it stand out as a remarkable chili, but it WAS good and I can only imagine that the leftovers will be even better.",

Things I would change: add a but more ground beef. Maybe 1.5 lbs. I also drained the beans but dumped the tomatoes in without draining. I like thick chili! It seemed too thick at first but after simmering it was perfect consistency. A lot of the flavor depends on what chili mix or spices you use... the latest was too spicy for me but that's totally my fault. We serve with Fritos and sour cream and sprinkle cheese on top. Yum!
