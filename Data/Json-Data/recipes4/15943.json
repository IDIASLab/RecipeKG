I want you to make it again, exactly the same way.\u201d This is real kudos to Bob (and to me too since I tinkered with the recipe a little).  What caught my eye about this recipe were the additions of bacon and liquid smoke, neither of which I\u2019ve ever used, and both of which took this recipe to the Chili Hall of Fame in our book (and let it be known, I am not a huge fan of chili).  Because of Hubs\u2019 sensitive innards I had to cut back some on the chili powder but this chili is so packed with flavor that caused no harm.  Just as I had hoped, the bacon and liquid smoke gave it a flavor distinction from other chili with subtle smokiness that made this unusually delicious.  Still, while I\u2019m sure it was good stuff as is, in our book my tweaks took this from good to great. Along with the onions, I also added chopped green pepper and celery because we love both it in our chili. I also used half kidney beans and half chili beans. And I have to be honest; I don\u2019t know why water was called for.  Water has no flavor!  I used my own tomato sauce from my garden instead.  So I essentially used half fire-roasted tomatoes, and half tomato sauce, no water.   This is an excellent recipe that I\u2019m sure Bob has no problems with anyone tweaking.   I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve not heard the end of this from Hubs; and that\u2019s a GOOD thing.",

Without the bacon, this is exactly the kind of simple, clean chili that packs warmth without too much heat and totally fantastic flavour. I usually add sweet pepper and corn to chili, but this one is so perfect that I tend to add those on the side.",
