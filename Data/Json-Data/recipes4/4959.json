After it was done, I added water until it reached the consistency I wanted, which also helped reduce the saltiness.  So play with it to get what you want.  I enjoyed the suggestion to add broccoli - it needs something green to off-set the \"whiteness\" of the dish.  This is definitely something you  would want to serve \"over\" a bed of pasta, rice, vegetables, etc.  It reminds me of a very fancy Cream of Chicken soup.  My BF loves this all by itself, but then - he's easy to please!  Good recipe and I'll keep it as a great \"go-to\" meal when I don't have the time to do anything more complicated.  Thanks CHEFCATHY!",

Since we enjoy onions thick slices of onion were layered on top of the chicken as it cooked and to reduce the sodium a home made version of the Italian dressing mix was used along with reduced sodium soup. We chose to use lite sour cream and no fat cream cheese again as personal preference. This was Outstanding and would give it 10 stars if I could.",

I liked the cooking method of cooking the chicken in the seasoning first, then adding the sauce.  I didn't care for the appearance (very WHITE) or the sodium (and I used less of the dressing).  I added a sprinkle of granulated garlic, dried parsley, and a tiny sprinkle of cayenne.  We served this with egg noodles and broccoli.  I stirred the leftovers together (chicken, noodles, and broccoli) and actually think it was better than the original, but we are big broccoli fans.",
