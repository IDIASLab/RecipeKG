I heated the rice separate and topped it with the stir-fry making sure to drizzle a little of the broth over it.",

Best of all it was enjoyed by the complete spectrum of tastes in my family from my husband (who loves his meat) to my picky-eater son (whose main food group is fruit). NO LEFTOVERS! The only change I made was to add more grapes. If you are one who likes to add grapes to your chicken salad for sandwiches then you will like this warmed-up version! NOTE AFTER MAKING THIS A FEW TIMES: I like to make this by cooking the rice in chicken broth which adds more flavor. Also I add the grapes in after the chicken is cooked for just 2 minutes; then I add in the rice and extra broth. This is long enough to warm the grapes but not so long that they get mushy.",
