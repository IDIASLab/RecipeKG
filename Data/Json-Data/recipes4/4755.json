I cut them up into chunks and cooked them in a wok with the onions, apples, paprika, salt, pepper, and butter. I also used skim milk instead of cream. This was really good, and time saving. I just didn't have 2 hours to make dinner. I would also suggest putting a crunchy green veg. in there as well, maybe sugar snap peas. I served it over long grain brown rice. The sauce was amazing though, and the recipe was really easy to convert. I loved making it a one dish sort of dish, aside from the rice.",

In a medium sized bowl I mixed the cream with the mushroom soup and the spices (including some chili powder to spice it up a bit). I added the cream mixture to the chicken and let simmer on low for about 45 minutes to tenderize the chicken.  I also added some currents and frozen peas about 1/2 hour before serving over rice.

The first time I used boneless skinless breasts and followed some other reviewers' suggestions to brown the chicken before covering with sauce. The chicken was kind of dry and the sauce didn't taste great. Now I use a big package of bone-in thighs and drumsticks and don't cook them at all (just season them as instructed in the recipe) before pouring the sauce over them. My goodness! This is one recipe I'd highly suggest following as written. The chicken is incredible, and the sauce is MUCH better for having all that time to bake in the oven. I've used variations of dairy, just depending what I have on hand. Anything from whole milk to heavy cream (and mixtures of the two) have worked great for me. I've also used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom soup - tastes great! This is a keeper! Oh, and if I have extra apples, I use two. Same with onions. I just like the texture of those things a whole lot. Finally, the recipe says to add salt, pepper, paprika and curry powder to taste - it might take a couple tries to figure out what amounts of these things you like, but it's worth it :) As others have said, it's impossible to be precise with curry measurements because curry powders vary so widely.",
