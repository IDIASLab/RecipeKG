                "reviewBody": "This has great potential. However the rice didn't stand out enough - there either needs to be a lot more or you might as well just leave it out. I think next time I will leave it out because you don't really need rice when you've already got tortillas! As for the tortillas I think I will leave them whole in the future and just use more of them. The casserole fell apart too much for my taste when serving it (it ended up looking like chili on my plate); I think whole tortillas would help hold it together in layers a bit better. I only had two cans of beans instead of three but I think that was more than sufficient and I added LOTS more veggies because this recipe calls for so few. I love veggies so I used two smallish onions 3 peppers (red/yellow/green) a whole zucchini and mushrooms. I wouldn't bother with the oil/marinade step. Why waste time/ingredients? Just saute the veggies in the seasoning. The yeast sauce was VERY good though. I will definitely use that again. I like having vegan (if you take out the butter) recipes in my arsenal just in case I ever entertain vegans for dinner. And I love that this recipe calls for brown rice and whole wheat tortillas. I always substitute with whole grains in recipes anyway but it's nice to see a recipe actually call for them. Thanks David and Krista!",

I used Corn tortillas instead of flour gluten free all purpose flour instead of white flour. I used olive oil instead of butter. I made the sauce but not sure I would make it again because I didn't like the way it smelled when I was cooking it and I'm really weird about my food smelling funny and then eating it anyways. I didn't hate the sauce... but will be looking for a different cheese sauce in the future. One preferably i don't have to myself to cut time. It took me alot longer then 30 minutes to prep this recipe. Regardless of all that I loved the dish in itself especially with topping it off with Jalapenos and sour cream. Next time I will be adding more vegetables I didn't feel like it had enough. As a vegetarian/gluten free eater I love my veggies:)",

This recipe is GREAT all on its own without either of those! My family requested leave ALL breading off...then they ate chips with casserole! LOVED IT! Also bottom layer I used refried beans with green chiles from a can. They LOVED it! HIGHLY recommend!",
