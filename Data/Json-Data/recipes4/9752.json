It was definitely different from the chili's we are used to eating. Had a sweet flavor and the cinnamon and allspice was kinda weird but was definitely complimentary in flavor. I thought it was worth the effort and time to make. I added a little water to the meat when I browned it so it would break down into fine particles instead of crumbles. My hubby didn't like this at all but he was a trooper and ate his plateful anyway. He said he doesn't like \"Yankee chili\". My son and I liked ours so much we both gave it 5 stars... I guess it is just a matter of taste. This isn't a traditional Texas style tomato chili pepper and meat type chili...if that is what you expect this is not it. If you like \"Cincinnati chili\" then I do recommend this! This chili freezes and reheats very well. Be forewarned though: it gets spicier after freezing and reheating! Thanks Holly!!!!",

Thanks for the recipe I never knew there were different chilis until I moved and got married. Mom's chili always had a special taste and I now find out it was the cinnamon and allspice. We use these spices in sausage making so they do not seem out of place with meat for me.",

And no cinnamon is not a sweet flavor but because it is mainly used in sweets it is hard to judge in an entree like this. It is spicy and I didn't use the dried chilis subbing in some homemade ground red chili powder instead. Served over spaghetti with cojack and sour cream. Each bite begged for another but still retained that cinnamon aftertaste. I also made regular chili at the same time and much prefer it. I have never had Skyline or Cinncinati Chili and so have nothing to base it on if it is comparable to those. My understanding is it has chocolate in it also. Thanks for the recipe.",

This was loaded with flavor and some zip from the chile's red pepper flakes and chili powder. I served it over pasta and topped with sharp cheddar cheese and a little diced purple onion.
