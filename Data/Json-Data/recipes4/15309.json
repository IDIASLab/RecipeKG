I made this recipe with a little less mushrooms (a mixed 4oz of oyster, shiitake, and cimini) and this was a good amount for us, although I don't think more would hurt.  Next time I make this I might add a little of the cooking liquid from the farro to my veggie mixture.  I had some issues with it starting to stick to the pan and had to decrease my cooking time to avoid trouble.  I think a little liquid would allow me to get my vegetables as tender as I would prefer.  Next time I may try adding chicken to this.",
