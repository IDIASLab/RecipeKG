I served the gravy in a gravy boat and let everyone add their own. This way the pork steaks are not swimming in the gravy. I changed the gravy a bit by using 2 cans of soup - 1 cream of mushroom and 1 cream of chicken. I added extra mushrooms and a small chopped onion to the sauce. I chopped some of the mushrooms fine and left the rest bigger because I like the big chunks. I would also suggest crisping up the pork steaks in the broiler for a couple of minutes after baking and BEFORE adding any sauce. Yum, yum! Serve with mashed potatoes topped with the same gravy.

Didn't want to open a can of chicken bouillion for only a 1/2 c. so used 1 T. chicken soup base in 1/2 c. water. Also up'd the garlic a bit to 1/4 t. \"Roasted Garlic and Savory Spices\" was the seasoned breadcrumbs I used. They turned out PERFECTLY. Moist inside with a nice crust. You could cut them with a fork. As someone else said next time I will double the gravy for the mashed potatoes I served with them. A true keeper!!! Thank you very much; I can hear his request already for this one over and over.",
