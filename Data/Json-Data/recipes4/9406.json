One thing I found though is that if you don't add in the oil with the crumb mixture but rather spray it on before baking it makes them crispier. We personally liked it this way better. We also used boneless skinless chilcken thighs instead of the breasts and like that better too. Great recipe!",

I used a Italian herbs mix rather than the herbs listed. Also I did not add oil to the dry mix I drizzled the nuggets once they were on the cookie sheet. I think that I might try breading and freezing them then pulling them out to cook at my convinience. UPDATE: I now make a double batch and freeze half. Once defrosted I make them exactly the same and they turn out great. My husband is usually a snob about frozen meat and he was surprised to hear (after he finished eating) that they had been frozen.",

Next time I will omit the red pepper and half the black. They were easy to prepare and done quickly. However they didn't get as crispy as I would have liked. Next time I will cook them longer or put them under the broiler. EDIT: I've made these again and they turned out much crispier. I double breaded them. I first marinated them in Italian dressing then dipped them in the bread crumb mixture then dipped them in the egg and then back in the bread crumb mixture. Also I baked them on a wire rack on top of a baking sheet according to the recipe. Hope this helps!",
