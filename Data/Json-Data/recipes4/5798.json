It could use a little kick, maybe some green chilies or some hot sauce.  It was really good.  I added cubed ham and bacon bits.   My kids even ate it.  I used more eggs than the recipe called for, I don't think 5 was enough.  Also, it takes a bit longer to cook than the recipe states.  This is nice because you can use all kinds of different things or veggies in it.  Whatever you would put in an omelet you could put on this.",

I followed others' suggestions and used more eggs (a total of 7) and added green pepper, black olives, and bacon bits.  It came out great and felt like I was having an omelet with potatoes and a biscuit (oh yeah, I used biscuits instead of crescent rolls).  I cut it into 6 pieces so one piece would be filling, and now I have breakfast for the next few mornings all ready to be re-heated.  My boyfriend liked it as well, and suggests having it with some hot sauce or salsa for a little more flavor/spice.  oh ps, I used chicken sausage, and it was fine.",
