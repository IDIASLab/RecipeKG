Also added two tablespoons of sugar.  Omitted the cilantro.  Excellent.  I will make this again and again. (This makes enough sauce for 1 pound of rice noodles, therefore a main dish for 4 people or two famished people. I also used two chicken breasts cut into long pieces and stir fried them in evoo before adding the sauce).\n\nFor a vegetarian option:  Steam some carrots and green beans in place of the chicken breast.   Then in a skillet, saute 3 cloves of garlic with 1 tablespoon of grated ginger.  When the ginger starts to turn pale brown on the bottom of the skillet, throw in the green beans and carrots with a splash of water to deglaze.  After this step, throw in the cooked noodles and then work in the peanut sauce.  ",

I did however add more coconut milk instead of water and used ground dried ginger (its all I had) Plus I added a heaped tablespoon of Sambal Olek (Chilli Jam) so omitted the lime and used a squeeze of lemon instead and it tastes fantastic. Just like it tasted last week when I was sitting in a resturant looking out over the ocean and listening to gamalen music!! :)\r\n\r\nHmm Actually I kind of changed the recipe LMAO I also used Soy rather than fish sauce as Husband is alergic to seafood but it still worked perfectly. Thankyou for an excellent guidline to base my sauce on!",

The various flavors in the sauce must have needed time to blend and accompanied by the taste of the marinated chicken, it was definitely 'The Best Thai Peanut Sauce\"!",

Next time I will use the regular coconut milk for more flavor. I found the most important thing was to make it ahead of time (day before if possible) to allow the flavors to develop. Make the basic recipe wait a couple of hours taste and start adding. Do this several times with at least an hour in between until it is to your liking.",

With a few of the suggestions of other reviewers I love this sauce. I cut everything in half. I then added more coconut milk to make it thinner about a tablespoon or so of sesame oil about 1/2 TBS of rice vinegar 2 TBS. of hoisin sauce and 2-3 TBS of white sugar. I put it all in a small food processor because I used crunchy peanut butter. I used everything else in the recipe. The sesame oil made the biggest difference and I highly recommend it. The hoisin sauce didn't add much and I probably won't use it next time. We had this with Vietnamese Fresh Spring Rolls from this site. (also had the fish sauce from that recipe) This peanut sauce is so good I was dipping bread in it. Will also use it to make noodle dishes.",

The good thing is it's easy to play around with and improve. I doubled the ginger, lime juice, soy sauce (low sodium), and coconut milk (lite), added some lime zest, copious amounts of chile garlic sauce, and several tablespoons of hoisin sauce, chucked in about a full cup of chopped cilantro, and thinned it with additional water. That made for a finger-licking good peanut sauce. I served it over whole wheat spaghetti with tender-crisp veggies (bell pepper, snap peas, scallions, broccoli) and pan fried tofu squares. ",
