The chicken marinaded for about five hours and that was enough to suffuse much of the meat with garlicky-sweet flavor. The browned bits of seasonings on the skin was a big plus. This fed my family including picky children without any complaint only compliment! I did serve with rice but could see how with mashed potatoes and turning the pan drippings into gravy it would've been excellent too.",

I ran short on olive oil so I used 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup canola oil. Almost the entire chicken was covered although half way through I turned the chicken. I marinaded the chicken for a total of 10 hours. Before roasting the bird (whole) I sprinkled the skin with a little paprika. I followed the instructions on this site for roasting a chicken using the high heat method. I highly recommend this as it results in a nice crispy skin. I'll be making this again. Thank you!",

Next time he makes this he is going to try with a of a cup of oil possibly even less than that. Also he let it marinade overnight; I don't think 4 hours is enough to infuse all the flavors into the chicken. Our 11 year old extremely picky eater loved the taste too; otherwise we would add some chilies to spice it up! And I agree with one other reviewer you could easily have this with mashed potatoes and turn the drippings into wonderful gravy!!! Thanks for a great recipe minus some of the oil for us!",
