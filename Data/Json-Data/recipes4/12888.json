I make them for my kids school Halloween parties and I feel so proud when all of the other moms can't believe that I actually made them myself. I make them with smarties and oreo cookies as well as the s'mores and they look just like I bought them from The Rocky Mountain Chocolate Company. I read many of the other reviews and the tips really helped! Try and buy your apples without wax but if you can't just wash them well in warm water and make sure to dry them well. Also when picking your apples balance them in your hand to try and find the most level bottoms so that they sit nicely. I can't say that this is the only way but I chilled them in the fridge like other members advised and that worked well for me. You'll find that rolling them slowely after dipping them will help the caramel set before rolling in the toppings or placing the smarties on. I had a baking sheet with parchment paper in the freezer where I put my apples for 5 min to help set and then tranfered them to the fridge. I know time consuming but worth it for all of the compliments you'll receive!",

I highly recommend putting the apples in boiling water for a few seconds to remove the wax then letting them chill before dipping them into the caramel. This way everything sticks a lot better.
