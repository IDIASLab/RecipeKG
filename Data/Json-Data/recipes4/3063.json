I took jennifermorse's suggestion of crumbling in some feta, but I'm not a big fan of red onions, so I added about 1.5T of fresh chives instead. Because of the intensity of the chives and feta flavors, I also cut the quantity of Italian salad dressing in half and added just a touch of olive oil.  I also substituted penne for the rotini since it was on sale this week, but I'm not sure how much that actually affected the flavor/texture.",

I'm pleased to say: in the battle of the pasta salads, mine was the only bowl that was completely empty at the end of the day!  The fresh veggies make this an excellent and refreshing summer salad.  I also added some fresh basil, some chunks of mozzarella cheese, and a little salt and pepper.  Taste-wise, this is a 4-star dish, the quick & easy factor makes it a 5.  Thanks for a great recipe!\n\nA follow-up caution: Be sure to check the sodium content of your dressing before adding extra salt.  I used a different Italian dressing the second time I made this dish and added salt, like I had done before.  It turned out too salty because my dressing had way more sodium than the other.",
