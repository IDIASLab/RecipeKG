I added garlic and onion powders to the meat, due to allergies, left out the carrot and used pinto beans instead of the kidney. The real fun came in when I took large Burrito size tortillas and made taco salad bowls. I inverted two small metal mixing bowls and sprayed them with cooking spray. I then sprayed both sides of the tortillas and placed them on top of the bowls and kept smoothing the top and sides until they formed to the bowls. Popped them in a 355 degree oven until they were golden and crispy. They came out great and once cooled I piled in the salad, used H.V. Spicy Ranch Dressing and topped with shredded cheddar. Thank you so much!",

Once I put enough into my meat to taste it was way too salty. I searched allrecipes and found this recipe. I used sausage instead of turkey and also used black beans. The spices are key. There is lots of flavor without the extra salt. You can add whatever veggies you please. I always sprinkle w/ Doritos just b4 serving. The best I ever made!!!",

I used Romaine lettuce and omitted the carrots and bell pepper (because that's what I had in the house). Finished the plate off with some cold salsa on top and sprinkled with green onions.
