I used a 1.75 lb brisket, and did not alter amounts of the other 2 ingredients (figured I could use leftover jus to make French Onion Soup).  Knowing it would be less cooking time than suggested, I cooked for 4 hours and the meat was well done.  I wish I had stopped at 3 hrs, when I had checked the temp and it was 142, between medium rare and medium. I also topped each sandwich with provolone (sharp, fresh-sliced). Hubs went nuts for this dish, and asked to put it in our rotation.  Next time I'll plan on cooking for 2.5-2.75 hrs to get it to medium rare only.  Good recipe - thanks!",
