                "reviewBody": "I used this recipe as inspiration. I remember helping my mother make cabbage rolls when I was a kid but I couldn't remember all of the ingredients. Also I wasn't sure what to do with \"dried spices\" as an ingredient so I went hog wild with what I had in the cupboard. I made a lot of changes. First I used a pint of leftover rice from a Chinese takeout rather than cooking my own. Second I seasoned the meat mixture with salt pepper and Penzey's Tsardust Memories seasoning (salt garlic cinnamon pepper nutmeg and marjoram). I also added a touch of milk to tenderize the meat and an egg to help bind it all together. The sauce was very different from what my mother made and I'm glad I stuck closer to this recipe than my mother's (which I think was just a jar of Ragu). However rather than dilute tomato paste I used a 28 oz. can of tomato sauce. I seasoned the sauce with Penzey's Frozen Pizza seasoning. Weird I know but believe me when I say it worked. I fried the first batch of rolls but it was such a pain that after I turned them I just snuggled the rest of the rolls into the Dutch Oven covered them with the sauce and popped it into a slow oven (300 degrees F) for three hours. I forgot to add the sour cream into the sauce so I put a little dab on each serving as I dished it out. In my opinion the sour cream isn't optional. It transformed the whole dish and made it more rich and delicious than I thought a tiny dab of sour cream could ever do.",
