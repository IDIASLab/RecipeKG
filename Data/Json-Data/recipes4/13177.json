                "reviewBody": "One thing I forgot to mention (or that got lost during the editing by this site) is that the habanero pepper slices should be fried on very high heat. This is achieved by getting the corn oil (or any cooking oil but olive oil) to almost smoking hot heat. Throw in the habanero slices and immediately the kitchen will fill up with for lack of a better word pepper spray. What gets fried out into the atmosphere does not become heat in the final product. If you prepare the peppers in this manner they will slightly char and retain their citrus notes without the searing heat normally associated with this pepper. However it will make your kitchen/house unpleasant to the eyes nose and throat for a little while. This is not to say that the tartar sauce will not be spicy. This is just the proper cooking technique for achieving the goal of this recipe. Suggestions to cut in half or by 3/4 the amount of habanero most likely result from cooks who do not treat these peppers in the proper manner. Happy cooking!",
