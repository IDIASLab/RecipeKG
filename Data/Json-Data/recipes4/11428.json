I love turkey and especially dark meat and I was really hoping this recipe would taste like a little Thanksgiving. No such luck. The legs were extremely bland - and I even added onion powder and garlic powder to the salt and pepper. It was moist though but thats dark meat for you. The stuffing however was really good even though I had omitted the walnuts and cranberries. Thats why this recipe got 3 stars without the stuffing I would probably only rate this 1 star. I also used chicken broth in place of the water and doubled the stuffing recipe - glad I did that b/c even after doubling my husband and I (the only ones eating) only got one scoop of stuffing each. I'm not a picky eater but I did not like these turkey legs.",
