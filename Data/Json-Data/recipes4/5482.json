That said, I struggled with whether to give this 3 or 4 stars. I decided on 3, but I lean towards 3.5. I made this pretty much as written, minor changes included using coconut oil instead of canola, and adding some chopped scallion and red pepper flakes to the stir fry pan at the mushroom adding stage. I served it over skinny rice noodles, very good way to serve. I used crimini mushrooms (sometimes known as baby bella) and would definitely NOT suggest using white/button mushrooms, although I'm a very timid/reluctant mushroom eater. I actually enjoyed the crimini mushrooms in this recipe quite a bit! I say if you like eggplant, DO give this recipe a try, and if you don't like eggplant, perhaps omit it and use some other veggies such as carrots, peppers, bamboo shoots, snap peas, etc.",
