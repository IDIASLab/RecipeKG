I melted some butter, sauteed diced garlic and onion, added some flour, and then whisked in the broth and milk (I used equal parts broth and milk - makes it more creamy). Add pumpkin and bring to a simmer. I didn't want mine to taste like pumpkin pie, so instead of the cloves and cinnamon, I added white pepper and cayenne pepper. These two really rounded out the savory flavor and gave it just a hint of heat. Also, plenty of grated parmesan cheese! I didn't want to stop eating it. Will definitely make again.",

Definitely worth a try, and you might love it. My mother could not get enough of it and thought it was fantastic. I used minced onion instead of onion powder and olive oil in place of the margarine. I think if I made this again, I would start with a roux as one of the other reviewers suggested. I could see kids liking this as it has a mild flavor. I also increased the servings to 8, which called for a full pound of pasta, a full can of pumpkin, and 2 cups of broths -- much easier measurements. I don't know why the recipe is written for 3 people. Seems like a odd number and throws all the measurements into odd amounts as well.",

After reading reviews I decided to add some caramelized onions to this. I substituted veggie broth for the chicken broth, plain soymilk for the milk, cheddar for parmesan, and skipped the margarine and onion powder. Some reviewers have mentioned that this was too soupy. I cooked this down for a while and also added extra cheese which seemed to combat that issue. I will certainly make this again and would love to do so when I have some sage in the house to add to the sauce. It was almost like inside out pumpkin ravioli which is one of my favorite dishes when we go out to eat. I'm so glad I can get something close to it at home without a huge amount of work.",

I decided to use evaporated milk instead of the skim. I use this in macaroni and cheese always for a creamier thicker result. I was also prepared to cut back on the broth. I made it as written only subbing evaporated milk for the skim and added about 2/3 of the broth. I let it simmer and it kept thickening, and I continued to add the broth. Eventually, I did add all that the recipe called for. As another reviewer suggested, I simmered it for longer, maybe 20 minutes, very slow simmer. With the evaporated milk and the longer simmer time it will get as thick you you want. Just simmer until you like the consistency. Very pleased with that. I doubled this, even though tonight it is for a side dish serving 2. It should be nice for tonight and some for lunch tomorrow, minus what I tasted. :) I used fettuccine, because I like it better. My husband usually prefers penne, but he's not home now and not cooking. Either would be nice. I tried it before adding the cheese, and didn't love it. The cheese needs to be there, even if you just add it to the top. It's a nice change from red sauce or Alfredo and very autumn-like. Thank you Connorsmom for sharing!",
