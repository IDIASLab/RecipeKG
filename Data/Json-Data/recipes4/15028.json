I omitted mushrooms and peppers so the kids wouldn't complain of CHUNKS and ran the barley through a food processor briefly and pulsed the black beans a few times to give a smoother patty.  Though I only had one egg, they held together on oiled foil on the grill with the use of some cooking spray.  I threw in some liquid smoke and Worcestershire sauce and used a smoked cheddar cheese to bump up the grill flavor.  Delicious!",

I also drained any excess liquid from the barley. I cooked the patties for about 15 minutes on each side at 400 degrees which helped dry them out and keep their shape. I used cilantro instead of the parsley and added crushed red pepper for a kick. All in all pretty tasty when topped with cheese and Dijon mustard.",
