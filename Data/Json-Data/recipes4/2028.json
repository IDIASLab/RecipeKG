If you don't this may not win you over. Like cabbage radishes have a peppery bite to them and it's pretty strong in those little red spheres. But it practically disappears when they're cooked. I've made this dish twice and here's my changes: halved the butter halved the garlic (or else you'll miss out on the almost-sweetness that develops) and added about one tsp chicken boullion powder ('cause I like cabbage cooked in chicken broth). Additionally I cooked them on the stove on low in a covered skillet stirring occasionally. Also I found that no additional salt or pepper was needed. Hubby thought they were \"just OK\" and 6-yr-old wouldn't even look at them but I know I'll be making these all the time. How ideal that I can make just enough for me.",

Otherwise it would be a three and a half because I sauteed the vegies in a pan instead. No rave reviews from four out of five people however our daughter Ashley loved them! Hubby and I are crazy about radishes in the raw and I guess we just missed the bite they give off when not cooked. I have to say I had no idea that radishes had any natural sugar. Much like onions they become so amazingly sweet. If you're not a radish fan I suggest trying this as you'll probably be pleasantly surprised.
