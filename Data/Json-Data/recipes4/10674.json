I just browned the onions and garlic then mixed in the spinach, spices and a 26 oz. bottle spaghetti sauce. I had a second bottle of sauce on hand. I also added a second egg to the recipe and changed the cottage cheese to ricotta cheese. I put some sauce straight from the bottle in the bottom of the pan then layered noodles, spinach mix, noodles, egg mix, noodles, bottled sauce and added chopped frozen broccoli to this layer. A full box noodles will be enough for a 9\"x13\" pan with two layers of each filling. Top with more sauce and cheese. Bake 30-45 minutes or until hot in center.",

I use Ricotta cheese and tofu instead of cottage cheese. The tofu has the same texture as the ricotta without the fat. I do about 1 cup each (ricotta and tofu). Just Ricotta also taste great. Also sometimes we add mushrooms to the sauce and it gives some meatiness to the meal. Also sometimes I use fresh spinach and it taste great.",

The only suggestion I would make is to set aside a little bit of plain red sauce (without spinach, et al) for the final layer.  The spinach darkens during baking, and I think this non-spinach sauce would make the dish more appealing to the eye.  Also, I sprinkled the top with some mozzarella cheese after I removed the foil for the final minutes of baking.  Yummy!",
