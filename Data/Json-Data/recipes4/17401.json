I also enjoy it MUCH more when its warm, it's the perfect tummy and cold remedy.  The tea is also filled with wonderful nutrients and vitamins that make your digestive tract very happy, and your body very healthy :) \n\n**TIPS the turmeric WILL stain anything that you use to make this!  I use a dark colored pot, and immediately wash the strainer and spoon I use when I make this.  I store it in a drink container (about 2 qt) that is meant only for this tea!",
