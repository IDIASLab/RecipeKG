Give it a try, it's easy.\n1 - Replace 1 c water with 1 c dry white wine.\n2 - No angel hair pasta at all. Instead, add 1/2 box linguine to the tomatoes etc. sauce and let it soak up the yummy sauce as it cooks. When the linguine is getting close to done, add the shrimp.\n3 - Enjoy! Love this stuff. (New Years Resolution is to reduce the butter/olive oil in it and still keep the flavor.)",
