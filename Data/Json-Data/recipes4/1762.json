Or you can brush with balsamic dressing (Renee's is nice). I wash and freeze my cilantro which makes it very easy to chop finely and it is \"wilted\" and perfect for the recipe so you don't have to sautee in butter. For colour I like to add a couple of thinly sliced rings of red pepper. Voila! lower in fat - no trans fat from the butter and pretty too!!",

I used butter (didn't think it made it to heavy) added some lemon juice (didn't have limes on hand) and generously sprinkled Old Bay over top before baking. Since it was wrapped in foil didn't think I'd get any benefit from the charcoal grill so I baked it for 20 minutes at 350. Will definitely make it again and recommend it to others.",
