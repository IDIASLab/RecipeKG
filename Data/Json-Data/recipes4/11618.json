As with most sauces/stews it's even better the next day. Works well with the Indian Basmati Rice on this site and would probably be good over noodles as well.",

I used leftover grilled lamb kebabs from Easter which were already well spiced with cumin and coriander. To that base I added canned tomato and chickpeas as suggested by others plus the rest of the recipe ingredients. It made a great stew that was wonderful over the basmati rice and was not too spicy for the kids (I added harisa to mine to pump up the heat!). Thanks for a good recipe and thanks to the other reviewers for making it great!",

I am trying to cut down on oil so I used just a short pour of oil(worked fine you don't need it to cook the onions and the fat from the meat is more than plenty to add the richness) I dredged the meat in flour before browning it to give it a bit more caramelizing (and because it helps the meat to hold it's juice it is every bit as tender). I added Chick Peas. I added a bit of the chickpea liquid as I went on because the sauce was getting a bit cooked down and it helped both with making more of a sauce but also the starch thickened it nicely. I think both the Cilantro and Spinach could be substitutes with any non-sweet leafy green - I like the bitter green in things like this but I am sure others prefer the less assertive spinach.",
