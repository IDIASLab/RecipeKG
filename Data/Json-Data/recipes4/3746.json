I used large breasts and cut them into 4 quarters. I ran out of crumbs after 3 breasts - used italian style breadcrumbs for the remaining chicken. Make MORE pretzel crumbs or use less chicken because the pretzel crumbs were MUCH better! Ran out of egg too - use 3 eggs or 3 large breasts not 4. I also put it in the oven at 400 for 20 min. on a foil lined baking sheet instead of frying - I'm just no good at frying on the stove top.:)",

It was really easy for me who happened to be short on time today. NOTE: You might want to drizzle a little butter over the top if you don't fry the chicken and add a little more spice. It might be a little bland and dry if you don't.",
