It came out just a little too salty. The dumplings are awesome tender cream-colored and just right. I used sliced bottom round. Next time I will sub out the soup for a box of Rachel Ray beef broth which is excellent stuff. I think it will help cut down the salt. I made it in my cast iron skillet and simmered it for about 2 hours.",

It also seemed it would be extremely salty so instead of both beef broth AND beef bouillon cubes I used 14oz water and only 2 beef bouillon cubes. I also chose to toss the meat in the seasonings w/ 2 Tbsp flour and did a quick sear and transferred the mixture to my crock pot. I deglazed the pan w/ 1/2 cup merlot and added that to the crock pot also. While this is a \"great depression\" recipe a bit of modifying can make it amazing. I think next time I'll add rosemary and port mushrooms",
