I chopped up 2 cups sweet potatoes in a chucky hash and cooked with sweet onion until golden. I had more cauliflower to cook so I probably doubled the recommendation. Due to that I had to compensate to overcome the cauliflower bitterness. So I plump up dried cranberries in warm water chopped fine and added. Also toasted 1/4 cup sliced almonds to add. Lastly I lightly drizzled about 1 tablespoon of pure maple syrup. I'm glad my husband liked it very much. (and he hates cauliflower)",
