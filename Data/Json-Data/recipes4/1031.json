I am fortunate to have a Pop that goes salmon fishing for me (well he likes to fish and sorta likes salmon & I'm not the best candidate for fishing and love salmon) so needless to say I always have some. Well I think that the baking dish could be exempted (the foil is just the same) as it took longer to bake and well I think it would be better on the grill & with some spicing up. I flaked the fish & mixed it with the veges for a nice pre-Superbowl lunch tomorrow. Thanks Eric!",

There was a lot of juice in the pan.  It would have been a MESS in a foil packet.  \nI used a Cajun marinade recipe from tabasco.com and followed the instructions as given.  It turned out DELICIOUS!  It did take almost an hour to cook and needed some salt.  Based on those things and the imagined horror of cooking in a foil packet, I am only going with 4 stars.  I do highly recommend this recipe though.\n*I plan to follow another reviewer's suggestion of using Spike seasoning instead of salt next time I make this!  What a great idea!\nI made this again and used eggplant instead of squash because that's what I had on hand.  It was still delicious.",
