The recipe calls for fresh or dried morel mushrooms, which give the recipe its best flavor, but any type of mushroom, fresh or dried, should work well. Similarly, he always used chestnuts, but we have found that pecans and hazelnuts (and, probably walnuts or cashews) work just as well. Preparation time depends on whether one is using dried mushrooms or not.",

As per suggestions made by the submitter of the recipe I used different mushrooms and nuts (walnuts). I checked out morel mushrooms only to find that not only are they seasonal but very very expensive as well so I used criminis (baby bellas). I sauteed the mushrooms for a bit in a touch of butter for browning and I dry roasted the walnuts in a pan. I'm sure that with each substitution of mushroom and nuts that the flavor will vary a little. Next time I'll use hazelnuts because I think that will go with the nuttiness of the rice itself. I think also that I'll go a little short on the sour cream too if I even add it at all! I've been eyeing this recipe for a long time and I'm so glad that it can now enter my repertoire of side dishes. Thanks!",
