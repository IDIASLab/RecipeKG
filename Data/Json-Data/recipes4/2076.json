If you wish to peel them, remove them from the boiling water and set in ice water for a few moments to cool enough to handle them and the skins rub right off. Always use unsalted butter as it works better for the moisture content.\nUse fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and you have less fat.",

Once heated, I added the recommended butter and covered with plastic wrap until lunch time.  They tasted divine!  No one guessed they'd been cooked yesterday...and I certainly didn't tell!

I was cooking for 15 people and wanted to have plenty of potatoes (plus leftovers!). I used about 13-14 lbs of potatoes cooking in three separate batches. I did peel the potatoes first. When mashing I added 1/2 cup half and half a couple of ozs of cream cheese about 2 tbsp butter salt freshly ground pepper and onion powder to taste for each batch and as I finished each batch I put them in my large slow cooker. The next day I added additional butter while reheating. I got many compliments from my family and they tasted great with and without the turkey gravy.",
