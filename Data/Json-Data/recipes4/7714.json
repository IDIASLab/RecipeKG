Add any veggies you have, thinking artichoke hearts would be an excellent addition.  Next time, I think I would save a pan and just push the pasta and veggies to the side and scramble the egg in the same pan.  Mine was just a tad dry, I think that is because I used leftover pasta.  Reserve a little pasta water to add at the end, if you want a little saucier dish.  Thanks for a good Sunday breakfast.",
