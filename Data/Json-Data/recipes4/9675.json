Thank you for this recipe!  \nI used a combination of fresh with frozen peppers & pearl onions etc.. the combinations are endless, add tomatoes or paste for a different  base. A tip - if you only have dried herbs, the rule of thumb is use three time less dried then fresh.  If it calls for 1 tbsp fresh, use about 1 tsp dried.  I tripled this recipe so I have more for next time I need it.  Thanks again!",
