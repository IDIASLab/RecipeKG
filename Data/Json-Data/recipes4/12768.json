I cannot find curry leaves any where around where I live and since I only found out last week that I was cooking Sri Lankan cuisine for my blog this week there simply wasn't time to order any. I read that curry leaves are similar in appearance to bay leaves but they do in fact taste like curry. I subbed 1-1/2 teaspoons of curry powder instead. I used a few of my saffron threads I didn't have powder but I don't really think that changed the dish at all. I also had to cut back on the chile peppers because my neighbor simply can't eat spicy foods. I used one jalapeno with the seeds and veins removed and minced it up very fine...he could eat this recipe. As this was cooking I could totally imagine being in a Sri Lankan marketplace...the smell was amazing. The taste of dish is fantastic! Thanks for a superb recipe!",

The flavors were great but it took me twice as long to cook which caused me to add alot more liquid to prevent the sauce from burning. Since I did not have a scale this may have been an issue more on my part of having too much potato.",

I would change up the method of preparation next time by sauteing the garlic and potatoes in some vegetable oil before adding the other ingredients.  For those who aren't used to spicy food I would recommend trying it with just the green chile peppers first and then, if you can handle it, add the cayenne. Overall a very good dish, thanks for sharing!",
