I also cut back the onion to 1/2 a small one. I also used dates instead of raisins which I highly recommend doing. I also used the couscous with the pine nuts and used some slivered almonds I had. I added some cucumber as well and used almost one whole can of chick peas. I used buttermilk ranch dressing - the same amount called for in the recipe. I realized at the last minute I didn't have any yogurt so I just added more ranch and it was still very good but I'm sure it would be even better with the yogurt. Great recipe though and you can really do alot of variations with it. It's a keeper!",

Also I made it with 3/4 cup of Garlic and Pepper savoury yoghurt (Brownes brand available here in Australia) instead of combining salad dressing and plain yoghurt and it was delicious!",
