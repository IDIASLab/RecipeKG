The texture turned out way too hard and all you could taste was bread crumbs, I think that 2 cups of bread crumbs is too much. \r\nHowever, I still had a feeling this recipe could be good, so today I made several changes: 1 whole egg + 2 egg whites, fat free cottage cheese, 1/4 cup of 2% cheddar + 1/2 cup parmesan, 2 minced garlic cloves, onion, spices and 1 cup of bread crumbs.\r\nFor the sauce: I reduced apricot jam to 1/3 cup, ketchup to 1/3 cup as well, and didn't add any oil just sprayed some Smart Balance before baking. I think that the key was to add less bread crumbs, you really don't need more than 1 cup. It turned out fantastic! I would have never imagined this combination of flavors would be soo good!",

                "reviewBody": "Even though these are vegetarian they seemed overly high in calories and fat. I pulled out all the stops in order to try to reduce both. Instead of 4 whole eggs I added 1 cup of egg substitute (like Eggbeaters). I also used fat-free cheddar cheese and non-fat cottage cheese. I used 1/2 nuts instead of the full 1 cup (I had cashews and almonds on-hand) and finally I used panko bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs. Things I added include: 1 tsp Italian herb mix 2 carrots and 2 stalks of celery minced in a food processor and 1/4 cup vital wheat gluten. For the sauce I completely omitted the oil and used sugar-free apricot spread. This made about 16 large balls. The flavor was actually very good and I've already made this recipe this way a couple of times. Even my non-dieting and non-vegetarian boyfriend liked them. The only slight issue with them may be the texture (they come out of the oven a little soft). When left in the fridge overnight they actually firm up quite a bit and are perfect. I think one could also throw the batter into a loaf pan and make a \"meat\"loaf out of this. According to my (rough) calculations each meatball has only about 120 calories and very little fat.",

I like these so much, I have been caught eating these cold from the refrigerator! ***I have made these numerous times since my original review and I have made an alteration in the recipe. I use 1 1/4 cups dry bread crumbs and 3/4 cup of fresh bread crumbs. I think the texture is better as they aren't quite so firm. They still hold up well in sauces. Great for making subs too!",

I baked mine longer than what the recipe called for. (my total cooking time was 1 hour) I didnt realize that the balls would firm up a bit more AFTER cooking so my 'meaty'-balls became a little hard. I dont know they just seemed too soft at 40 minutes. But even when hard they were good. My mother enjoyed the flavor of the sauce. Also I cooked one of the 'meaty'-balls plain(without the sauce)it was wonderful. I ate that one after cooking 40 minutes. I guess that one seemed right(more done) because it was dryer than the ones with the sauce. I will use this recipe when making spagetti from now on. (bake them and then just throw them in the spagetti sauce. Lastly I dont know who well they freeze but I'm gonna try.",
