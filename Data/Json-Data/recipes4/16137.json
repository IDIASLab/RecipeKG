This one was perfect, as the noodles and mushroom soup help balance out just a bit of the tart so I can truly enjoy, but hubby still loves it as well.   Made in a 9x13 pyrex and had just enough room to stir everything up.  It was cooked perfectly after about an hour and 10 minutes, but I think the cook time is very flexible and a few minutes over or under won't make much difference as long as the noodles are still wet.  Wonderful, easy dish that will be added to the regular line-up in my household!",
