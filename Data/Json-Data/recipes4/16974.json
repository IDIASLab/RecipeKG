Also, I doubled the sauce, but only used 1/2 the water b/c we wanted the sauce to be on the thicker side. I had an 8oz. pkg. of sliced mushrooms to use up, so I cooked them and added them, which was a wonderful addition. I lightened this up a bit by using whole wheat seasoned breadcrumbs, extra lean ground beef and Healthy Request Golden Mushroom Soup. This was very flavorful and comforting for a chilly fall day. I will def be making this again and again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I usually make a much more fancy and complex salsbury steak, that takes much longer than this recipe. frankly, this one was almost as delicious as my usual recipe. I think i may make this one from now on due to the simplicity of it. \n\nNote: if you look at the photos, all of the photos have a much darker gravy than one particular photo (mine). I think this was because I used a very lean ground beef, so there wasn't a lot of grease. this is one of very few recipes that call for ground beef that I actually think a higher fat content may make for a better meal/gravy.... although it still tasted amazing! \n\nthank you for the easy recipe and the full tummies!",
