A little tip: if your meat balls are all wonky looking just spray your hands with a little cooking spray and reshape once they are on the baking sheet. Works like a charm!",

Don't get me wrong, it's not like I expected them to be bad, but I've never made anything with ground chicken, and I've heard a lot of negative things about using it.  But, I followed the recipe as written, using  very soft cream cheese, olive oil for the oil and fresh herbs.  I MIGHT have added a bit more bread crumbs, but I can't say for sure.  I did use my 1/8 cup scoop because I only have the use of one hand, currently, so I got about 30 meatballs out of the recipe. :)  After mentioning an idea, and getting some feedback in the RE, I decided to try to create a complimentary sauce to serve these with pasta, so I made a sage/cream sauce and tossed it with penne rigate.  SO GOOD! :)  Thank you, Raquel, for the opportunity to branch out, and mis7up for the \"name game\" which made me make these, sooner rather than later. :)",

The recipe submitter suggests using only 1 egg; AR won't let you modify a published recipe, so she can't \"fix\" it, and so it is up to the reader to read the top reviews (she's #1). Using only one egg eliminates most of the stickiness issue. Beyond that, this is just what ground chicken IS -- it's soft and squishy and no amount of stuff added in is going to make it into ground beef texture, so don't try, or you'll wind up with dry meatballs -- or gross breadcrumb-flavored meatballs. I reduced the salt in this recipe by half and thought it was delicious. I made no other changes but next time I might try fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, just because. Thanks for the recipe, Raquel! (P.S. Use a cookie scoop, one with a trigger release, to form any meatballs but especially chicken and turkey ones!)",
