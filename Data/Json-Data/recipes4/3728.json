I used a Granny Smith. I ended up adding the whole apple extra carrots & only 1/2 of the tomatoes. I also like a bit of crunch in my veggies (and fruits in this case!) so I left out some of the carrots & apples until just before pouring everying in the blender. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks!",

The only thing I did was use the whole apple triple the basil (fresh) and top with crumbled cotija cheese. Thanks for the great soup idea!",
