I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and placed in a greased dish. I mixed the two cans of cream soup with 1/2 cup broth and poured it over the chicken. I then sauteed celery and onions in the butter added 1/2 cup broth and mixed it with the dried stuffing. I poured it over the chicken covered it and baked for 60 minutes. I uncovered it and baked it for another 15 minutes until the stuffing was nicely toasted. Thanks for a great recipe!",
