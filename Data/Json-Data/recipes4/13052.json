I basically made the recipe as written with the only changes being the spices I added to the meat as it was cooking. I added Nutmeg Allspice Garlic powder Sage and a small amount of Ginger. Had I not added the spices this dish would have been considerably more bland. With the spice additions and the accuracy of the directions given I give this recipe a solid 4 stars. In addition I made a creamy mustard sauce to go with the rolls.",

The taste of the cabbage is long boiled out as is the flavor of the filling.

It was edible filling and rather healthy for the large amount of meat in it but I wouldn't make this again.",
