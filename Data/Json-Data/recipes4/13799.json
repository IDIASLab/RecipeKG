There wasn't any juice to this salad, so I wasn't sure extactly if that was right. It's seasoned for sure, dressed??? I'm not so sure. But it's a decent light summery salad for sure. Do try. Will make again and play around with the flavor more. Thanks",

Growing up in Kansas City I rarely every had a raw cuke without it being marinated in vinegar of some kind but not everyone likes vinegar either so my only other suggestion would be to add a fresh herb of your choice and that would definitely kick it up a notch. I will make this again but with tweaks.",

As other reviewers suggested I added extra Tabasco sauce some freshly ground pepper and even a littlle bit of chopped cilantro but it wasn't enough to take it beyond blandness. Served with chicken scallopini sesame green beans freshly cooked apples and strawberry shortcake for dessert. It's a very colorful dish with nice presentation but beyond that I don't think there's much to recommend it.",
