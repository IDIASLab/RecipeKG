They couldn't crisp up (I use a fry thermometer so I know it wasn't the temperature) the batter was disappointingly thin and they were virtually flavorless. I can't believe something fried could be such a disaster. I reread the recipe over and over again to see if I missed something or did something wrong - I followed this recipe to a \"t\". I'm guessing it's the water that didn't work out. I'm going to stick with flour/eggs/breadcrumbs from now on.",
