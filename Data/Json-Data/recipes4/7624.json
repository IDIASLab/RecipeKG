I used Salpica brand Cilantro Green Olive Salsa with Charred Tomatillos which had medium heat.  Against my better judgement, I followed the recipe and used pork loin. For roasts that need to be pulled, you should really use a fattier cut such as pork butt, shoulder or ribeye.  Pork loin will not pull well because it lacks fat and, more importantly, collagen, so you end up with dry meat.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it smelled delicious while cooking. I will definitely make this again, although next time I'll use a different roast. Super easy recipe for a busy week day.",
