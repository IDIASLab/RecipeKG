One must add that it is impossible to create a good gazpacho using grocery store blah tomatoes.  This recipe calls for the very best, juiciest, tastiest tomatoes one can find, usually from a hothouse or family farm.  Thank you for including it, it jogged my memory and I will use it as soon as my tomatoes are ready to be picked.",

On the side in separate bowls for self-service: Small diced green bell pepper - Small diced red bell pepper - Small diced yellow bell pepper; Small diced cucumber; Quartered sun-ripened organic red cherry or grape tomatoes; Quartered sun-ripened organic yellow cherry or grape tomatoes. (All above ingredients must be chilled and served at the last minute.) Small cubes of loaf stale French bread lightly pan-browned in olive oil - Ice cubes to be stirred in slightly to dilute the soup plate (refreshing and a nice visual effect) And a carafe of olive oil. I recommend the Catalan Estornell; widely available in the U.S.A. the label has a starling bird on it it's made from Arbequinas a mild sweet olive variety though climate altitude weather conditions and lots of other factors determine the flavor - or the Andalucian family's four groves around Baena in the Cordoba province production of N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Prado Flor de Aceite their numbered bottles are available at Dean and Deluca; both these first cold-pressing organic extra virgin oils are pricey though not insanely so but in my opinion are the best table (not for cooking) Spanish olive oils.! Buen apetito! J.P.G. The recipe makes 8 cups of soup (7 servings).",
