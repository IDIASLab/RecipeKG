They had HUGE air pockets in them...perfect for filling w/ honey mixed w/ just a bit of real maple syrup. FANTASTIC! I froze some of the balls on a cookie sheet & then put them in a freezer bag to pull out when wanted. Thanks Xenia!",

My favortie Mexican returant used to serve these nice puffy ones but have since changed them to something totally different. For the longest time I havent been able to duplicate them at home. This is the closest I've gotten! The key is to make sure your oil is hot enough to get them to puff just right! I also made a dipping sauce for them simialr to what I had at my favorite Mexican resturant. I mixed water and some powdered sugar let is simmer for a few minutes and then turn off the heat and add a few tablespoons of butter. Let me tell you this is EXACTLY what Ive been searching for...THANKS A TON!",

If you cut the rolled dough into triangles as instructed they turn out quite small and makes the process more time-consuming so I sliced them in half instead. Also these need to be eaten right away. I made them for a party and made the mistake of storing them in an air-tight container. By the time they were served they had flattened and lost their crispiness. They initially had bubbled up nicely (make sure your oil is very hot.) But the samples my husband got right out of the pan were a hit! I'll make again when I have the time.",
