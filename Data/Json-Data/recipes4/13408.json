First I believe you only need about 5 cups of water but \"may\" need to add an extra cup or so - depending on whether or not the rice is covered when you go to place it on the stove to simmer. Also chicken is a great substitute for the lamb - as is veal. When frying the eggplant it's best not to overlap them - but it really doesn't matter too much in the end. Some reviewer's commented that the cooking time is too long. I use jasmin rice and it cooks in about 30 minutes. But if you've got a favourite rice you use often you would have a better guess as to when it would be done. The prep time is longer than other dishes but certainly not more difficult. And certainly worth it every time! =) P.S. What I use to speed up the prep time is frozen vegetables!",

Even though looking for authentic I made some changes to match this dish to our liking for example didn't fry the veggies in oil but merely sauteed them in 1 tablespoon of butter. If you choose to do so as well I recommend doing the zucchini first and then adding a little more butter/oil to your pan and sauteing the eggplant second as it has the ability to absorb crazy amounts of oil (probably why another reviewer found it very soggy). I used basmati rice and it does cook a little faster still like the original poster commented 7 cups of water is way too much even with 5 cups you will have to let it simmer with an open lid for at least 10 minutes so I would recommend not using more than 3-4 if your rice cooks faster. For the dish to hold form the rice should absorb all the water. Even with these changes we simply loved this dish I garnished with cayenne and dried mint as I found these would compliment this dish the most. Thank you:)",

After frying the vegetables you need to salt them prior to layering them with the rice.  We use basmati rice which we soak for 20 minutes in hot water to soften it.  Drain the rice and mix with salt and the same spices used to make the meat-this combined with the soup from the meat should give the dish enough flavor for those saying there is not enough salt. I have made this with lamb and with chicken...both are delicious.  We also saute pine nuts or almonds and sprinkle over the top once it has been flipped along with some fresh chopped parsley",
