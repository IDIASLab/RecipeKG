I made mine into a 8\" cake. Watch the time on the cupcakes. Follow the cake mix directions on the back of the box (don't use 3 eggs unless yours says too). Ice cream shell would be great for a frosting substitute on these if you prefer!",

After they cooled I wrapped them in plastic wrap and frozen them over night.  The next day I placed one in the bottome of a 13 x 9 pan then spread almost a gallon of softened ice cream on that.  I topped it with the 2nd frozen cake.  I wrapped the pan with plastic wrap and refroze.  When I served it, I served a slice with whipped cream, chocoate sauce and a cherry.  Everyone LOVED this both ways I made it.  :)  Thanks for a great idea.",
