I followed the recipe exactly my husband and I were astounded at how good this turned out. I cut the jicama and turnip into med-small chunks about thumb size to help them bake easier. I baked my vegetables in an 11x15 pan for about 70 minutes and stirred them several times while they baked. The vegetables became sweet and slightly caramelized so good! Thank you for this recipe!!",

For me it has to be perfect as written to get a 5.",

I did not have jicama so I replaced it with fennel as another reviewer suggested. I used fresh rosemary and thyme from my herb garden- about 2 Tbsp each. I used a little less olive oil and salt than called for in the recipe simply based on my personal tastes. Save for those slight adjustments I stayed true to the recipe and really loved it. Everyone did! The veggies get that sweet caramelized flavor when they're roasted. Just delicious. Will make this again!",
