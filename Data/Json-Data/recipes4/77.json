Then I had to make my own gravy and pour over the slices (once they were removed from the water) to give them some taste. An expensive mistake because I paid 20.00 for this 5lb. roast.",

I used a 2 1/2 lb roast so I cut the water salt bouillon and garlic salt in half. But I put the suggested amount of other spices into and tea ball and it worked out great. I'm not a coffee drinker and didn't want to invest in coffee filters I won't use so I picked up the tea ball on a chain and it was PERFECT for this and reusable. I thought the beef was perfectly spiced and very versatile. The black peppercorns gave it a wonderful flavor. Oh yeah because the roast was not covered in water I turned it over every couple of hours. YUM!!! Thanks for this recipe Tammy!!",

I made a few changes; didn't have peppercorns so I used course ground black pepper substituted a can of beef broth for the water and boullion cubes left out the rosemary because I didn't have any. I bought a roast on sale cut it into large chunks and simmered on low all day in my CrockPot while I was at work. I shredded the beef and let it simmer another hour in the juices before serving. Served on toasted sweet french rolls with lots of melted Jack cheese and the juices on the side for dipping. Made a big green salad to go with and YUM-YUM!! VERY GOOD! I plan on using the leftover shredded beef in Taco's tonight. I just love recipes where I can use the leftovers in a completely different way because my husband and son usually turn up their noses to leftovers. Thanks Tammy for a simple delicious and versatile recipe! This one is going into my family favorites recipe book!! I will be making this one often!!",

I had a much smaller roast (maybe 2 Lbs.) but I used the full amount of seasoning called for. I subbed 2 Tbsp. beef flavored Better than Boullion for the cubes omitted the oregano (due to personal preferences)added a tsp. of McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning a sprinkle of Accent and a few drops of worcestershire sauce. Didn't bother with the coffee filter idea... just added the seasonings to the water. In less than 4 hrs. we had incredibly tender deliciously seasoned meat with an excellent dipping broth that I was able to freeze in cubes for future use. (Bonus points!) Don't be afraid of the salt this is a boiled piece of meat and you really need it. We enjoyed ours on toasted subs with melted swiss cheese on top. I could also see myself preparing this with the oregano and other seasonings to use in Mexican dishes. Thanks for the recipe Tammy. It's a keeper!",
