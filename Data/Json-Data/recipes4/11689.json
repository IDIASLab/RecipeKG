This was the first time my wife had had duck and she enjoyed it but it was a little rich for her. I love duck but it seems to be an aquired taste with some people. Also needs a little something as served with rice and bread its quite a dry meal even with a glass of white wine as we had. Garry Smith",

Since waterfowl season recently opened (and the men's hunt was successful) I had to find some ways to prepare this bird. I'll be honest I'm NOT a fan of duck (or wild goose) but this recipe was great! I followed the recipe exactly - except I only marinated in Italian dressing for 5 hours instead of eight. Also I didn't need to secure with toothpicks I just wrapped the bacon around the breast and placed it seam side down. BUT - I had to flip 3/4 of the way through so that the bacon that was on the bottom would turn crisp like the top had. Thanks Triboys for the easy no hassel tasty recipe!",

I've cooked it just about everyway you can think of and this is one of my favorites. I will throw a couple suggestions out that I use as an addition to this base. First I alwasy slice my duck breasts into the size chunks I'm going to use before I marinate them. Secondly sometimes I soad them in cola for 24 hours or so. The italian dressing is a must and leave it in there as long as you can (24 hours isn't too much). The only other thing I do is to add a half pepperocini water chestnut banana pepper or jalepeno between the duck and the bacon - just to give it a little something else. Cook until the bacon is done and DO NOT OVER COOK - medium or medium rare is the way to go. Wash down with ice cold beer!",

So I don't soak the meat to remove any flavor from it nor do I marinate it in anything. I use the other reviewer's suggestion of the jalepeno and it's a big hit. I simply lay out a piece of bacon (I use turkey bacon to cut out a little of the fat) lay a piece of duck on it put a jalepeno in the center of the duck and roll it all up. I usually chop up some fresh veggies and bake the duck on top of the veggies. I've also grilled it the same way except I wrapped it all up in foil to retain the moisture.

The bacon does help but as mentioned in a previous review when cooking in the oven you might want to turn meat over after bacon crisps to allow the bacon on the underside to crisp also. In the end it wasn't anything I'll probably make again. Think next time I cook duck I'll go with a little bit more \"traditional\" of a recipe for duck.",
