The first time, I used the beef & pork mixture and it was good, receiving a great reaction from my husband and son, \"Please *only* make this meatloaf from now on!\".  The second time I used half ground sirloin and half ground turkey, plus Italian bread crumbs.  I also made a \"channel\" in the top of the loaves (fills two pans w/ two lbs.) and added some Italian tomatoes before I baked them.  Scrumptious!  Other reviewers are correct - this makes a GREAT meatloaf sandwich.  Also, FWIW, I didn't taste the onion soup mix much.  Others may not be using two lbs. of meat to one packet???  I added in a LOT of black pepper, too.",

Maybe I will try to seal the edges better next time.  I used cheddar as other's suggested.  It made a dense meatloaf that didn't fall apart.  I also put a little ketchup, mustard, brown sugar mix over the top.  I will probably stick to my old favorite, but this would be worth making again.",

I think it's because I tried poorly to make my own bread crumbs since I didn't have any and instead of onion soup mix I used half an onion which ended up being too much. So first time not too great but the second time I had all ingredients again used two pounds ground beef and I mixed the sharp cheddar cheese in with the meat I used Italian bread crumbs onion soup mix and it turned out a lot better. I did the same thing the third time and all three times I added a layer of ketchup on top because my husband likes meatloaf better that way and it added just enough tang. Also my husband and I hate pepper so I used garlic salt all three times and the third time I also added season salt since those are my two favorite seasonings.:) Over all very creative idea and really good when made properly I'd definitely recommend it.",

I recommend 1:30 to 1:45 cook time. In my opinion the center cheese layer (that which is not mixed into the meat) did not add much to the flavor of this meatloaf. Instead it just caused the slices to break in half when plated. My husband loved it but I'm sure he'd like it just as well without the added calories/fat of the full 2 cups of cheese.",

If I make this again I'll put a layer of sauce in the middle and mix all of the cheese with meatloaf (or just add cheese to the top at the end of cook time).  I don't care for onion mix so I used 3 little green onions and some italian salad dressing for kicks instead of the soup mix and that worked out great.  It was juicy and stayed together nicely.  My mind says meatloaf needs something red or gravy.  Without it, something is just missing. I had ground pork and beef, but really couldn't tell.   Overall good, but I didn't like the cheese in the middle.",
