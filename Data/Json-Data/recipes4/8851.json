This was a nice fast dinner once I paired it with a spinach salad. My fourteen year old liked the 1st helping but then didn't know if she liked the gnocchi. Flavor was great so I will serve this again and again until she likes gnocchi. I would put yellow and red pepper in next time to make the flavor pop a bit and give it some visual appeal. Don't forget to to use a bit of freshly ground pepper to the finished product. Thanks for the recipe!",

Also I doubled the milk portion so there was extra sauce and that was perfect for us. After removing the gnocchi from the water I tossed then w/ the sauce to get them coated plated them and topped w/ the sausage more sauce and the cheese and basil (I forgot to get fresh so I used a sprinkling of dried). I think this would also be great w/ tortellini. Will def make this again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I cooked the sausages and shallots in a covered large frying pan instead of in the oven over medium-low heat turning every 5 minutes for 20 minutes and finished them off uncovered. I read someone felt the sauce was under-flavored so I added Pinot Grigio wine to keep the onions moist while cooking. Also once removing the sausages from the shallots and adding the butter I added enough flour to absorb all the grease and make an oniony roue before adding the milk to create a proper cheese sauce. Will make again.",
