Ok I made a few changes instead of a green pepper I used a drained and rinsed can of diced green chilies. I didn t have fired roasted diced tomatoes so I used 3 regular cans of diced tomatoes and added 1 tsp. of smoked paprika. I also added 2 tbsp. of brown sugar. On the preparation front I cooked the pepper flakes onion red pepper and garlic in a saucepan and added a bottle of beer. Once those were soft I used a slotted spoon to transfer them to the slow cooker then cooked my pound of ground bison in the remaining beer liquid. Once that was browned completely all the liquid was gone made for added layers of flavor! Thanks for the great recipe!!!",

It made for a soupier chili. 3) Add a dash or two of Tabasco at the end. This chili is rather sweet and that helped to counter act. This was great with Vegan Agave Cornbread Muffins!",

It made it taste earthy and just slightly sweeter. I did make a few changes based on other reviews. I did not drain my beans which helped make the chili soupier. Also I used fresh garlic. And I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. The one thing I would have liked is for it to be a little spicier. I would recommend added diced green chilies/jalapenos/something to add a little more heat which I will experiment with next time around. Thanks for the fun fall recipe Daisy!",

I pretty much made just as written my changes were to use garden fresh chili pepper and two jalape\u00f1o peppers in lieu of the green pepper. I did add some yellow and red bells though. I also used whole 15oz. can of tomato sauce instead of the two different cans of tomato sauces the cook recommends I think that may be a typo. I did add a bit more cumin and chili powder since we like spicy. I always add a dash of cinnamon to my own chili and this one certainly was no exception. I loved the creamy thick texture the pumpkin gave to the soup only giving a delicate nutty sweetness to the normal hearty southwest chili dish. With the fall coloring the pumpkin adds along with the variety of beans and vegetables plus the added health benefit of the pumpkin make this a dish I will regularly rotate in the cooler months. You could even make this healthier by adding ground turkey instead of beef or use an extra can of beans and no meat at all. Thanks Daisy K for the recipe.",

I used the amount of spice indicated in the recipe (and yes my spices are fresh and have not been sitting around forever) but I thought it just tasted like tomatoes and that was it. It was edible but not enjoyable.",
