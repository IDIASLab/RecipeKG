I only had one can of cream of celery soup so that was all I used. I actually am glad that was all I had because I felt to my taste that the cream of celery was overwhelming for a potato soup. Then I used Half & Half instead of all heavy cream (which I would again). I think next time I will use either just cream of potato soup or maybe one of each (potato and celery). I will definetly be making this a lot as it is a good base but just with my own personal tweaking. Thanks for sharing Tabitha.",
