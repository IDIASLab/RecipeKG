Cake batter was done per the recipe - I did line my cake pans with parchment to keep them from browning too much and affecting the lovely red hue. As for the frosting I did whipped cream by hand vs. using something from a tub. I mixed a 1/4c. of frozen raspberries (thawed) into 1 1/2 c. of whipped cream for the filling between the two layers then did the rest of the cake in plain whipped cream. I think the effect was lovely and it frosted much easier without the berries to mar the smooth exterior of the cake. As it is not berry season I left off the fresh berries from the top. This was for a friend's birthday and the response was overwhelmingly positive! I will keep this in my files for future cake making - thank you so much for this.",

I've made a few adjustments over the years: Instead of using whipped topping as frosting,  I use the basic cream cheese icing from Allrecipes (minus the vanilla so it's not too runny),  blended with  half of a 10 oz bag of frozen raspberries, drained.  I add maybe 3 T of all purpose flour to the cake recipe to get the balance of moist delicious cake that's not too moist due to all those raspberries.  Sometimes in the summer I plate the slices with fresh raspberries and fresh mint. A delight.",
