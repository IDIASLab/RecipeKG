I omitted celery and carrots because of my families tastes and added a little celery salt in place of regular salt to compensate. Rather than breadcrumbs I used oatmeal soaked in about a 1/4 C of milk. I also added a couple of Tbsp of mustard to the meat mixture and brushed with BBQ sauce before cooking. Wonderful!  UPDATE: I have made this at least 5 times in the last couple of months, and it's still amazing!  I've made it with the world's cheapest pork sausage- still amazing.  I've substituted ground chicken (not exactly the most flavorful of meats in something like this)- STILL amazing!!  I always use low-sugar ketchup and it doesn't impact the flavor.  I've even subbed ground pork rinds for the bread crumbs (a low carb trick...) and guess what?  STILL AMAZING!!  I doubt I'll ever try another meatloaf recipe again, this one is a winner!!",

I mean what s the point of trying a new recipe if you re going to end up doing what you usually do anyway? I pretty much stuck to the recipe with only minor deviations even cooking the vegetables first which I generally don t do. I had a meatloaf mix on hand (ground beef/veal/pork) so in order to compensate for the lack of spice I would have had with the pork sausage I simply added a good deal of Montreal Steak seasoning. This was very good. Simple basic meatloaf ingredients. Nothing fancy nothing weird or unusual. I really did think it might be an overload of garlic you sure could smell it as the meatloaf was baking! But it was fine (thank goodness). The ketchup topping was something I hadn t had in many many years. This was what my mom did with meatloaf and it evoked pleasant memories of a time looooong ago. A good solid reliable meatloaf recipe. (Note: I always bake my meatloaves for 1-1/2 hours and have never been disappointed)",

I didn't have carrots or celery and I don't think they belong in meatloaf anyhow. I used 2 pounds of pre-packaged meatloaf mix (ground beef ground pork and ground veal). I used diced yellow onions instead of green onions and I was out of garlic (didn't know it till it was too late) so I substituted garlic powder. Then I pulled out my bread crumbs to find that they were Parmesan flavored. Oh boy I thought this was going to turn out to be a mess but IT WAS AWESOME!! Kudos to Angela on a wonderful basic recipe that can be tweaked and still turn out fantastic.",

(OK, but then I dipped mine into ketchup that I'd mixed w/ Sriracha sauce, so that gave it a kick!) Only other subs I had to make were crushed Saltine crackers instead of breadcrumbs and dried parsley instead of fresh, and 1 lb. ground beef to 1/2 lb. pork. Ohhhwowowow served this on Christmas Eve, and we were blown away. I froze the few leftover slices, knowing that the following days would be infused w/ turkey, dressing and holiday trimmings, and when I thawed and re-baked it wrapped in foil, I couldn't believe how delicious it still was. I have a feeling this will replace all meatloaf recipes in my recipe box, and I love that it's got more veggies in it than just onion.",
