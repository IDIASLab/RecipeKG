Some ideas to help yours turn out better would be to turn the roast over half way through baking for more even cooking and if you have left over stuffing you are best to add more liquid to it put it in a separate pan and cover it. Our extra stuffing was really dry but the stuffing rolled inside was good.",

I usually make more stuffing and cook in separate pan - the reason for extra butter - otherwise is way too dry. But the raisins and cherries add extra sweetness. Can also place some cherries on top of the roast as it bakes. All in all a very good and easy recipe. My family loves it. I think one of the best things about cooking is that you can make small changes to recipes - just have fun and experiment - it it turns out bad - you dont do it again but sometimes - you make a wonderful discovery and everyone loves it. Then you have your \"family\" recipe. But this is well worth trying.",
