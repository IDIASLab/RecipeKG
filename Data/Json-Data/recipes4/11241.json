The first time I made this, I didn't make any modifications and it was superb.  The second time, I added 1/2 cup of cocoa and baked as a cake since I haven't found an adequate fruit-sweetend chocolate cake recipe.  I also blended the fruit and water until it was a thick paste so that I didn't have bits of fruit all through the cake.  It was pretty good right out of the oven but after sitting for a day, it tasted even more chocolatey and awesome.  Thanks for the recipe!",
