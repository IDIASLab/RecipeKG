It is a modified version of a long time secret pork barbeque recipe of a now out of business barbeque restaurant in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It can be made the day that it is to be served, but the best is to cook it the day before, place it in the refrigerator overnight, and then heat it in the slow cooker the next day to serve. This way, it soaks up all of the added flavoring.",

I did the serving size for 4 and my husband loved it so much that there was none left over. I added about 2 tablespoons of garlic and 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke. Instead of hot pepper sauce I added hot crushed peppers. It gave it alittle kick. My husband said that it didn't have enough BBQ sauce so he added alittle more to his plate. It is easy and quick to put together and you can cut everything up ahead of time. I didn't make it and have it the next day. I don't know how much better it could have got. It was excellent. Never cooked with liquid smoke before and it gives it that smokey favor and printed this out and going to make again. Thanks A",
