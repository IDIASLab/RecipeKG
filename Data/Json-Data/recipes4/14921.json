I've never really gotten the phrase \"comfort food\" before.  I mean, I understand what it means/what it is, but nothing has ever really screamed COMFORT FOOD in my world.  Until today.  It's unseasonably cold and dreary and I could not wait to get home and taste this.  It did not disappoint....\"comfort food\" popped into my head a first bite.  I followed the recipe, though I did slightly increase everything to use potatoes and ham I had on hand.  This will become a slow cooker staple in the LTH house.  THANKS for the recipe, Jane!",
