I thought this really needed some sort of sauce. A garlic aioli might be nice. Also adding some freshly grated parmesan to the panko I used might bump up the flavor.

To make up for the missing seasoning I threw in large pinches of basil marjoram paprika and 2 Tbsp of fresh chopped parsley. I also made a sauce to pour over by making a rue with half the portions of the recipe's listed butter and flour and added the rest of the can of chicken broth I had opened and enough milk to get the consistency I wanted.
