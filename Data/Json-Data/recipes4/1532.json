I did however make some additional adjustments so I am rating the basic recipe as best I can since I \"tweaked\" it so much. I think it's a good basic recipe to start with but it would not have been as pleasing left as is. I doubled the spices and the vinegar. I also used canned tomatoes mainly to get more juice. I have added chicken broth or vegetable broth depending on what I had on hand and both work well since this dish needs more moisture (especially if you are putting it over rice). I used green red and yellow (or sometimes orange) peppers to the recipe because the red peppers are very sweet and the other colors are not just pretty each adds a slightly different flavor. I added chickpeas to mine because if you look at the photo attached to this recipe it clearly shows chickpeas in the picture and the recipe did not call for chickpeas. I was very confused about the photo containing chickpeas and it did make me wonder if this photo was the author's finished dish? Or perhaps she forgot to add the chickpeas to the recipe? Anyway I added them and we enjoyed the dish once I had made considerable adjustments.",
