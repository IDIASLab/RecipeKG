I made the recipe as-is (except I used oat milk in place of water and added a spoonful of chia seeds for an added nutritional boost) and it definitely didn't get anywhere near pudding consistency. If you're going to make this don't add any additional liquid until after you've made it. I think most people won't want added liquid. Also I highly recommend the chia seeds! Not just for the nutritional boost but they give smoothies a frothy and creamy texture that is just amazing.",
