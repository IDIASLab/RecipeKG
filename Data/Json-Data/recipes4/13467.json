So I was looking for something new we'd never had.  I did make some changes to this recipe.  First I used homemade vegetable stock in place of the water and ended up using 3 cups total. I used a mixture of red & brown lentils because the recipe didn't specify.  I omitted the marjoram & sage because I didn't have them.   I used 1 tsp minced garlic from a jar and a mixture of red/green/yellow peppers because that's what I had.  I saut\u00e9ed the onion, carrots, celery, and green peppers for about 5 minutes in a little olive oil for added flavor.  I also didn't read the directions thoroughly and ended up combining everything but the cheese in the pan.  I baked it for 30 minutes at 350 and checked it, the liquid was gone (which is why I added another cup as stated above for a total of 3 cups) at this point I turned my oven up to 400 covered with foil and baked an additional 45-55 minutes, checking a few times for doneness.  I also added onion powder, garlic powder, and oregano - to taste because it was too bland for my tastes.   I did not bake it with the cheese it melted without putting it back in the oven.  This isn't a dish I will cook every week, but it changes things up and I would make it again.",
