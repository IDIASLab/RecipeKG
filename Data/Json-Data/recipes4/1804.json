It will suit the salmon and onion flavors much better. . . It is also good when placing a row of asparagus spears lining underneath the fish when baked.

When you place the salmon back into the oven the cheese and nuts will brown slightly, but not melt.  I think that the Ch\u00e8vre and walnuts complements the flavor of the fish much better than the cheddar.  I used a 1:1 ratio of walnuts and Ch\u00e8vre.  I have made this recipe many times and it is my husband's and my absolute favorite, plus the walnuts add even more healthy omega-3 !!",

I changed the cheddar cheese to a baby swiss, added 4 finely chopped garlic cloves, less dill, and lightly drizzled olive oil beneath the cheese to keep the Salmon moist. The flavor was very complimentary! We laid asparagus spears on the bottom of the foil, and they were cooked to perfection!",
