I bought thin cut chicken breasts, rolled them up with FRESH spinach, proscuitto, provalone and 1 basil leaf (under the spinach so it soaks into the chicken).  I rolled them in breadcrumbs, secured them with toothpicks and browned the outside in olive oil and garlic.  Then I put them into a baking dish, poured in the garlicky olive oil from the pan added about a tablespoon of butter, tore up a couple of sage leaves, poured in some white wine, covered the pan and baked them for about 20 minutes and then uncovered for 10.  Awesome, awesome.  It was one of the best things I have ever made.  The sage made it.",

I layered prosciutto provolone and fresh spinach leaves on the pounded chicken breasts and add some chopped sage leaves; rolled them up and secured with toothpicks. I then browned them in 2 tbs. olive oil. Added a little salt and fresh ground pepper. When they were evenly browned on all sides I took them out of the pan and put them in a baking dish. I added a cup of white wine to the pan and let it reduce for about 10 minutes. I then added the wine to the baking dish and put it in a 350 oven for about 25 minutes. Everyone raved at this dish!

First I used fresh spinach instead of frozen...it was a great taste I could not imagine using limp frozen spinach. Also I folded the breasts in half and closed with toothpicks instead of rolling it. Then I cooked the chicken in the pan for only a minute or two on each side. Then I moved it to a baking dish poured in the wine and let it bake in the oven....I think I was about 400 degrees for 35 minutes or so. I used a baster a few times to baste the wine over the chicken. I served it with Garlic Parmezan Orzo...(also found on here) and Asaparagus. It was a dinner that my guests complimented me on all night!",

Sprinkled each with kosher salt and garlic powder before laying ingredients I did use frozen chopped spinach ( its all I had on hand) Used toothpicks to hold closed then I sprinkled with italian breadcrumbs and browned them lightly in olive oil and garlic. then I set them aside in a corningware and made an awesome sauce with the pan drippings and chicken broth and MORE garlic ( we LOVE garlic). added a drop of lemon juice and a little bit of white wine and some fresh chopped parsley. Added the sauce to the Corningware and sprinked with fresh grated cheese. cooked in the oven for 30 min. Basted a couple of times. Some of the cheese melted out but it made the sauce even tastier! Not dry at all and my husband was raving. I froze 4 of them and some of the sauce to eat again next week. Definitely a keeper. Thanks Crystal!",
