I let the dough rise 2 times and I encountered a problem as I used waxed paper instead of parchment and it was quite a task to transfer it to my stone (I sprinkled corn meal on the hot stone). I also added cooked italian sausage mushrooms grn pepper and pepperoni and used only about 8 - 10 oz of the cheese. The cooking time 15 mins worked pretty well despite my additions and the stone gave a nice crunchy crust. I'll definitely try it again and will buy some parchment as it could have been a disaster without hubby's help during the transfer!",
