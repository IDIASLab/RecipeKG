                "reviewBody": "Not bad. Something to remember: Mahi Mahi is a very mild white fish that has almost no flavoring whatsoever (in my opinion at least) so it's going to turn out flavorless unless there is seasoning that is strong. I didn't think there was even close to enough lemon pepper seasoning in this recipe to help it along so I added about a tablespoon of that and increased the lemon juice to closer to 2 lemons worth and sprinkled Parmesan cheese on the fillets before baking. I also marinated for about 24 hours turning occasionally to make sure it was coated. Something I also tend to forget when I'm making thicker fillets: fish can cook better at higher temps so when 350 wasn't cutting it after a half hour I jacked up the heat to 425 for 20 minutes and it was cooked. This turned out relatively well but for a flavor that our household liked it needed some zing. If you have a household that isn't so sold on flavor (they salt things to death use ketchup no matter what it is...) the original recipe will work just fine. It just needed a bit more for us but all in all a decent starting point. Thanks for the recipe!",
