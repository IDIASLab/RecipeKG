I did add a red onion, and black pepper to add flavor because of the reviews. And an extra teaspoon of minced garlic. The only issue I had was that I used ground deer venison; if you're familiar with deer venison, you know there is no grease when browning the ground meat. So I had to add a little water before adding the flour because it was starting to stick to the bottom of the pan. I still added the 1/2 cup water when the recipe called for it. However, it was still very thick. I think I will try to thin it a bit next time. And, like I said, you can definately taste the wines, so if you're not a 'cooked wine' person, you may want to cut them back some. We served it over Angel Hair Pasta. We liked it and will most likely make it again.",
