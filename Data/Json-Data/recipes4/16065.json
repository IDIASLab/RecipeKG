I used milk instead of water, and let the fish soak in the egg/milk wash for about 5 minutes. I also added onion powder and paprika to the dry mix--which for me was einkorn flour and milled corn. The batter stuck to the fish, and cooked up nice and crispy. My husband loved this, and we will likely stick to this one from now on!!!!",

We liked the Tasty Outer Coating and the way it Browned up very nicely.
