The pork was tender & so flavorful.  Loved the vinegar/anchovy combination.  Doubled the sauce and sprinkled the tiniest bit of sugar in it at the end.  Other than that, wouldn't change a thing.  Reminder - this is a white wine vinegar sauce (not sweet like a balsamic sauce), so a little goes a long way.  You might want to serve it on the side.  Thanks so much for posting :)!",
