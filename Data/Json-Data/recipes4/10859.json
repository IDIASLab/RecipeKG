When I cooked the eggplant first it soaked up all the oil and there wasn't any left to cook the onions.  It worked much better the opposite way.  I also used a can of Italian diced tomatoes (only because I didn't have any fresh) and that worked out great.  I added extra water but I also used very large vegetables so that could be why I needed more water.  All in all a very good way to use up vegetables from the garden.  It freezes great too!",

I think I skipped the Marsala (feeding to kids) but we certainly didn't miss it.  Thanks for a keeper!",

I had no idea what to do with the eggplant as I had never cooked it before. This recipe suited the ingredients I had on hand to a T so I tried it even though my family isn't much for a great variety of vegetables. I'd be willing to eat this for a week if they won't. Lots of chopping but well worth it! I didn't have marsala so used vegetable broth for the water and wine. Had to chop most of the veggies small to increase the likelihood of my brood eating it but left the zucchini and eggplant in chunks and added some ready-made meatballs (they love those). Also had no basmati so used ready-cooked brown rice instead. Wonderful flavor comes from the fresh herbs garlic and tomatoes. Also added some bay leaves. Red pepper really gives it a kick! YUM! I'm going to serve it over crunchy garlic bread with fresh parmesan cheese on top. Can't wait. Hope they like it too.",

I used an electric burner so used the low setting (instead of simmer) for the last 30 minutes. Will definitely make again!",
