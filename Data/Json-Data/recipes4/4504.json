Here is what I did. -I used 1 pork chop- it was probably around 2\" thick so I halved it and cut it into pieces (and that's all I could fit in the bottom layer. -I could only fit 2.5 layers of potato & onion in. I used 3 'B size' red potatoes and 1 onion ( 2\" diameter). Potatoes & onions were sliced about 1/4\" thick. -1 used only half the jar of cheese sauce and thinned it with milk & water -cooked in the crockpot on high for 5 hours probably could have gone less. Overall this turned out pretty good. The pork chop was tender and falling apart. The sauce wasn't too runny or thick and everything had good mild cheese flavor. I couldn't taste the onions though. I will make this again but I might need to add something to it (garlic? tabasco?) as I prefer bold spicy flavors.",

I only used a couple pork chops since I was only cooking for myself and my husband (next time I will use more as they were falling apart and it would have been nice to have more meat). I laid the pork chops (used pork tenderloins) in the bottom of my crock pot layered sliced/peeled red potatoes and a sliced yellow onion on top of it. I repeated those layers and I did not use flour I also only added pepper once I was done layering it. I also added some garlic salt instead of just regular salt to the top. I did not use a jar of cheese sauce because that sounded gross to both myself and my husband. Instead I took some suggestions from other reviewers and used a can of campbell's cheddar soup and a can of campbell's cheddar broccoli soup. I mixed both of those up with milk some all seasoning and pepper and poured it in over the pork chops and layered potatoes/onion slices. I put it on high for 5 hours (which I believe was far too much as my pork chops were falling apart) next time I will probably just try doing something around high for 4 hours or low for 5 or 6. Overall with changes made I liked it and my husband loved it. It seemed weird at first having cheesy pork but it was quite good. Served it with some warm rolls and broccoli will probably make again.:)",
