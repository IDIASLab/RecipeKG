Just a little cucumber makes it not too overwhelming.  I prefer using salad dressing but you can substitute mayonnaise.  The longer it sits in the refrigerator the better it is.",

The ingredients sound strange together but the end result is so good even the kids gobbled it up. I used sugar free lime jello \"lite\" miracle whip and full fat cream cheese. Because I love the taste I also added about a tablespoon or so of fresh dill and everyone loved it. Has a fresh cool flavor on a very hot day. Definitely will make again I am going to try with lower fat cream cheese to make it a little more healthy.",
