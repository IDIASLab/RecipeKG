I did not have time to make this in a dutch oven. I browned the meat in the oil, then added it to my crockpot with the celery and the carrots. I then sauteed the onions and garlic in the drippings with a little butter until the onions turned translucent, then I deglazed the pan with the wine. I poured all of it into the crockpot, then added the tomatoes, potatoes, spices, beef stock and tomato sauce. I let this cook all day until my family got home. I made homemade yeast rolls to go with. This was one of the best stews I've ever made. It's got a beef burgundy feel to it, it's rich and decadent tasting. I had a big bowl when I got home from work and it was like eating a big hug.

Other than coating the meat in flour first, I made no changes to the recipe.   I had my doubts that 4-6 hours simmering was necessary and even thought it might work against this dish, but I chose to follow the directions.  After two hours I was ready to call it quits but let it go another hour \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t have.  By this time, three hours, the meat had broken down and started to fall apart into small pieces.  I would have much preferred a stew with good-sized chunks of meat.   Four stars rather than five for directions that essentially took this backward as it overcooked.  After two hours it seemed to have reached a turning point and lost quality beyond that.   An hour and a half to two hours would have resulted in tender meat that still held its shape.",

DO NOT BURN the garlic !) Next, deglaze skillet with some wine and add all to crock pot.\nI used a \"Lambrusco\" wine ... added 3 tbl. of \"Kitchen Bouquet\", and 1 tbl. of \"Lee & Perrens Worchester Sauce\".

I will keep closer to the 1 inch recommendation next time.\n\nOne tip I saw somewhere that was helpful was to freeze the round steak for 15-30 minutes (not frozen hard) to make cutting it easier and it worked great.",

My stew meat was tender after 3 hours on the stove top. I can't imagine that a better cut of meat would hold together for 6 hours in the pot and the vegetables would be nearly dissolved if cooked that long. This makes a generous amount of stew and I had to use a 6 quart dutch oven since I do not have a skillet large enough to accommodate this. The stew as written nearly filled my pot. The stew liquid is well-flavored though thin (I prefer a thicker sauce consistency for stew) and not too strongly flavored with tomato. I only have one other tiny criticism. Herb leaves turn dark and unattractive in tomato based sauces. I think it would be more appetizing to tie them up in cheesecloth and remove before serving. I can well imagine this as a soup if everything is cut into bite-sized pieces. If you wish to make soup I would recommend adding the carrots mushrooms and potatoes later in the process so the smaller pieces will not cook too long. Overall I give the recipe four stars both for the flavor and for the directions.",

But the second time I made it I added only basil and oregano as my spices but upped the garlic to four cloves and added a quarter cup of Worcestershire sauce. Now it is five stars! Yum!!!",
