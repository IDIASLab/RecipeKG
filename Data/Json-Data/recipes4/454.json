This is a good basic recipe that I look forward to playing with more. One easy addition was swirling raisins, cinnamon and  a bit of brown sugar into it. I'll probably try a garlic and olive addition next if it's Celiac approved. Thanks!",

Both for texture (it actually rose and had air pockets) and for taste, it is similar to wheat bread.  One technical note, if you try to make it with a bread machine like I did, make sure to check your machine because mine had trouble mixing the dough; it was so dense.  I had to keep scraping the edges and helping it along.  As for the recipe, I didn't have millet flour so I just added some sweet sorghum flour and more rice flour (only had brown).  I also added threw in some flax seed after reading other reviewer.  I used rice milk as a substitute for the skim milk.  I followed the advice to mix the rice flour with the milk before adding it to the mixture and I think that helped.",

I have a Cuisinart Convection Bread Machine; it is hard finding gluten free recipes that don't take alot of different flours. This recipe I adjusted the flour as follows: I only had Red Mill GF All Purpose Baking Flour and brown rice flour. I used 1 3/4 C. GF All Purpose Baking Flour and 1 1/2 C. brown rice flour. The bread came out beautifully. My husband and I aren't GF intolerant, only my daughter, and we really enjoyed the bread too. Thank you, Rene49",

Took out the vinegar changed the honey to Karo syrup delete the millet flour and double the garbanzo bean flour. Tricks: proof the yeast in some of the warm milk and a tsp of sugar - set aside and add about 20 minutes after the flours have been moistened with the warm milk. The best trick: do NOT use a bread machine; otherwise I always ended up with a white solid brick then my husband said he could sell at Home Depot in the building materials dept. I used a potato masher. Spray 2 loaf pans sprinkle with corn meal before pouring half the dough into each pan. Smooth over the tops with a wet spoon then paint on an egg wash then brush them with a little Karo syrup. Wow - light spongey tender bread with a crispy brown crust. I did add a photo to the recipe page the browned loaves with butter spread over the slice I am holding.",
