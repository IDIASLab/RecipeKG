I absolutely loved this, and would make it again any time.  Frozen peas worked just fine for me.  A little bit of whipping cream & a sprig of mint garnished this very nicely.\n\nThank you so much for the recipe!",

Finished with a sprinkling of chardonnay/garlic flavored sea salt, a dolop of sour cream and a sprig of rosemary as garnish.  It was a hit getting rave reviews from everyone.
