The first night it's a stand-alone salad; the second night, heat a portion in a pan with an additional canned veggie and it's a side dish. If you have a favorite veggie, add that; if you hate corn, leave it out. Have fun and eat without guilt!",

My version: 2 cups cooked brown rice 1 bunch collard greens (steamed for 10 minutes and chopped into bite sized pieces) 2 diced tomatoes 1 and 1/2 cups thawed frozen corn 2 thinly sliced carrots 1 cup pinto beans 4 oz can sliced black olives 2 finely minced cloves of garlic 1 diced cucumber squeeze of lemon salt & pepper. As you can see mine is just a slight variation of the original because I wanted to use up all the odds and ends I had lurking around the fridge. Thanks for a great recipe idea!",

I used some left over white corn, used black and green olives, (Didn't have any green chiles).  I already had some left over brown rice, used it and mixed everything together and oh my Lord, this was great!  I love collard greens and so does my husband!  This came out so great....and then it hit me, I forgot to add the left over black beans and the Italian tomatoes!  Not to worry, we had some of the salad left over, I'll add these last two ingredients for lunch and really enjoy!  Thank you for this recipe!  I must make this for company when I host another dinner party!  What a wonderful alternative for many items I like!  This salad really rocks!!!!",

I also used quinoa and roasted fresh green chiles. Since I didn't use \"Italian style\" tomatoes I added a sauteed onion and a clove of garlic along with plenty of fresh oregano. I ended up adding two more cloves of garlic and 1 tsp cumin and I thought it could have used another onion. The peas seemed out of place and I don't think the Italian seasonings work with the veggies--this was much better with the cumin added. It did taste better the next day.",
