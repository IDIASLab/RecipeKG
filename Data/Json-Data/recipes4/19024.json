I did not add tofu or miso broth and subbed fish sauce for fish oil. I also doubled the carrot and used a bag of shredded 'cole slaw mix' to replace the 1/2 head of cabbage. I also halved the salt because my chicken broth added plenty of salt. Enjoy!",

Used 2 cups of chopped cabbage and didn't have fish oil, so used 1 tsp fish sauce instead. Did not use miso or tofu.  Added chicken cilantro wontons, delightful!!  Next time will throw in the snap peas with the wontons as they were a bit mushy, and I almost forgot, didn't add any salt.  Next time will add a few tbsp of soya sauce",
