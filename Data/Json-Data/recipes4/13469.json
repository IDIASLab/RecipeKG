I also like to leave the bones in for the calcium - just crush them up between your fingers (they are really soft) as you come across them when you are mixing everything with your hands.  This is a nice recipe to have children help out with and they love to get their hands messy and be able to eat what they made for dinner.",

Since I'm doing the Weight Watchers thing it bulked up each salmon cake so the portions were lower points which means I could eat more! LOL But it's a great basic recipe and not fried!",

I thought this would be a different recipe to try out since I had some left over white rice from the night before. I followed the recipe exactly (except for already having a cup of cooked rice on hand) with carrots and wild caught canned salmon. The end product is pretty bland and tastes just like canned salmon. If you don't like the taste of canned salmon you probably won't like the end product as written. We like fresh wild salmon or even farmed salmon that has been doctored up. But this needs some serious seasoning to help out the falvor. If I were to make this again I would add a little more onion and some old bay seasoning to see if that would help. Our one year old did love it she ate an entire ball herself.",

Additionally I sauteed the onion and some celery in butter to soften before adding to the mix. To make the sauce less \"anemic\" in appearance you can substitute with Golden Mushroom Soup or add Kitchen Bouquet to the original - Cream of Celery also works; additionally: can add further seasonings if desired (and even some chicken \"granules\"). I used the \"pre-cooked\" single servings of Uncle Ben's brown rice which is microwaveable and simplifies things. I have to say that with the additions it turned out great!.....a nice change from the usual salmon croquettes or patties because of the rice rather than breadcrumbs or potato flakes.",
