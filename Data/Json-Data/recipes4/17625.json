The liquid from the tomatoes made my cream sauce separate originally but it sorted itself out in the end. I used both chicken and pork tamales and they both worked good. Even though I originally had issues with the cream sauce, the taste is delicious and that is coming from someone who doesn't typically care for sour cream sauces. This is a great way to utilize leftover tamales.",
