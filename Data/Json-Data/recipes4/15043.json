I generally use the contents of my vegetable drawer here so I kind of throw in whatever I have at the time, so you can use your own judgment. They taste really nice when eaten with sour cream or low-fat mayo or even on their own -  though my husband prefers ketchup. I generally use this recipe as a guideline, so have fun with it!",

I also increased the amount of tuna by one can and added an extra egg to help hold it all together. Before I fried the patties and medium-low heat in the skillet I pressed them using a hamburger press.  \n\nI toasted some whole wheat bread and sliced some tomato and avocado to add for toppings along with some low fat mayo.\n\nHope this helps somebody eyeing up the recipe...

As with all recipes I tweeked the recipe a bit and personalized the ingredients I used. Instead of bread I soaked 3 English muffins in a combination of water and milk. Instead of zucchini I chopped up 1/4 or a green bell pepper. I then pulsed everything in my food processor so that there would not be any big chunks of anything. They are very tasty and I like the seasoning as stated in the recipe except next time I would eliminate the basil and oregano and maybe add a bit more dill. I don't think the basil and oregano do much to add to the flavor of these but then I am not a big fan of either of those seasonings. The next time I make these I think I will try using 3 eggs so that they bind together a bit better. TIP: Use an ice cream scoop instead of getting your hands all gooey and grubby. Dislodge the patty from the scooper into the oil and flatten down with a spatula. This makes for nice unformly sized patties.",

I was surprised I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the size of the patties made mine the size of a burger and served on hamburger roll with tartar sauce. It was incredible.

The additional of the veggies made the mixture more watery than I expected and a few of the tuna patties didn't hold together as well. Will definitely be making this again!
