I placed all of the seasoning in a bowl and whisked it together.  I then coated the fish with the seasoning, placed it in a greased baking dish, and poored the remaining seasoning over it.  I served the fish with steamed broccoli and roasted garlic couscous.  My two year old and husband gobbled it up.  Quick and delicious!",
