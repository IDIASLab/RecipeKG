The result was a deliciously rich, gluten-free cake with a heavy crumb. A few sprigs of rosemary tossed into the lemon syrup as it simmered (and then strained out) added a little extra dimension.   I'll definitely make this again soon, but with just a tad less butter (some melted through the springform). The cake could easily serve 12 and would be fabulous paired with some ricotta and berries, or perhaps Greek yogurt and apricots.",

This amount will easily serve 6 people. The flavour of the cake is actually quite delicate with no hint of a cornbread taste. The lemon glaze gives it a gooey texture and the almond meal accents that. I kept mine in the fridge and served cool with warm toasted almond shavings on top. A nice, light cake that just happens to be gluten free, can't beat that! Thank you for the recipe.",
