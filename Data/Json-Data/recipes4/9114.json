The soup definitely needs more seasoning, I added basil, onion powder and garlic powder, I also added 1 tbsp of brown sugar as it tasted very tinny from the tomato paste. I had half a green pepper to use up so I added that in, I think mushrooms, zucchini and baby spinach would be nice additions as well. I used vegetable broth for the beef and added about 1 extra cup of water after I added the pasta to make it soupier. I used whole wheat penne pasta because that is what I had. I added the pasta to the soup and heated through then served. The cheese mixture was very dry so I added some milk to it to make it scoopable, I aslo added oregano, basil and minced garlic to it. My son and his friends enjoyed the soup, especially the cheesy part. I made this for Allrecipes Allstars Canada April Challenge #ARFaceless",
