You can eat it with almost anything: honey, cinnamon sugar and a cup of tea, stew, sauce or by itself. My husband and I love to eat it with honey while it is still hot. My kids love to cut them into small pieces, put them in a bowl, add little bit of sugar and shah (Somali tea), and eat them like that.",

I've never been able to make this with a mixer although if you have a mixer that is used to make dough I suppose it can be done. I did not want to take away stars because I have tried neither suggestion. I fry the bread using oil liberally. It is a good recipe and the bread is so versatile. The recipe is not as complicated as it seems but there is no way of getting around all the steps. It actually goes quite quickly once you get the hang of it. We eat it with breakfast snacks chai and stews. Yum!",
