I also added 1 mince clove of garlic, fresh rosemary, thyme and just a hint of cinnamon. I seasoned the pork chops with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I used Savory Herb Stovetop Stuffing and it was excellent! The fresh apples with the onion made it very flavorful without it being too sweet. My husband loved it. By using fresh ingredients instead of the canned apple pie filling, it was a very elegant dish. A keeper!",

Seasoned the chops with sage, salt & pepper before browning.  Made some Stuffing mix using the stove top directions.  My husband loves gravy, so I mixed up a packet of pork gravy for the side.  So good!  Can't wait to make it again!   \n** Edited to add..... I purchased the pork tenderloin twin pack from Costco.  Each pack has two tenderloins,  I cut it into 1-1/2 in thick medallions  WOW!  Amazing.  I also poured about a 1/4 cup of gravy over the top before baking.  I make it in a loaf pan since it's just for me and my husband.  THANK YOU for such a great recipe!",
