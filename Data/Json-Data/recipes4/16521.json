I did not find the recipe any easier to prepare than any other lasagna recipe, and it did take me a lot longer than 20 minutes. Also I couldn't get the white sauce to thicken up, even after 30 minutes!  Finally I added a third Tbsp of flour and it thickened.  The final lasagna looked okay before cutting, but it was incredibly soupy.  I had added some cooked and drained vegetables to the red sauce so that may have somewhat increased the liquidness, but it was really just lasagna noodles floating in liquid sauce on one's plate.  I think there is too much pasta sauce in the recipe as written.  The recipe calls for 2 (28 ounce) jars of sauce, so  i added 2 24 ounce jars of sauce.  But perhaps the person meant 2 jars of sauce TOTALLING 28 ounces.",

The white sauce was a bit difficult I recommend you mix the flour salt and pepper together before putting it in the butter and I did end up adding an additional tbsp of flour to thicken it. But it turned out really good. I had a block of Coby Jack cheese that I shredded to used with shredded mozzarella instead of the mexican cheese mix. I think that helped keep the Lasagna together. All my past lasagnas just fell apart on the plate but this was easy to cut into even pieces and stayed together on the plate. I didn't have any problem with it being too liquidy like someone else said. You have to be careful to drain the meat really well and not over cook the spaghetti sauce because it can get soupy and since it's going in the oven for 55 minutes it doesn't need to be pre-cooked. I thought it was going to be too much sauce but it was perfect. I didn't add any other ingredients. Overall we enjoyed it and I'll definitely use this recipe again.",
