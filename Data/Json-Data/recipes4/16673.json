There s nothing at all spicy in the meatballs so if you want that spicy Buffalo flavor I d recommend you mix up the sauce and taste before you add the honey. Also you really want the meatballs well coated with the sauce so I d suggest you double it or even triple (next time I ll triple) because the warm meatballs quickly soaked up the sauce. I mixed the hot sauce and butter together omitted the honey (personal taste preference) tasted and since we wanted it a little spicier I added a sprinkle of both cayenne and garlic powder. Basically you ll just have to adjust the sauce to your taste. This was a nice change from Buffalo-style chicken wings and not nearly as messy to eat!",
