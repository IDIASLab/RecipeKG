I added a chopped jalapeno to the onion garlic mix to give the chili some extra heat. I also added a can of kidney beans and about a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon at the end and ommitted the tomato paste adding a few tablespoons of tomato sauce instead. I let it cook overnight (12 hours) and it was the perfect consistency. I was SO tempted at the beginning to add some liquid to the pot as it looked really thick. I'm glad I didn't because it made it's own \"juice\" during the cooking process. I love that it didn't need any salt added!",

Since I had way too much meat I added a big can of crushed tomatoes to the slow cooker and thankfully everything came out fine anyway. Thanks for a great recipe!",
