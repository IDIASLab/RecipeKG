It seems that aficionados of kalua pork are pretty determined about how it should be prepared. And there isn't just one way, just like there isn't just one way to fix fried chicken. So try Meg's Kalua Pork before judging it. BTW I have it in the crockpot right now, just as she wrote it. I'm giving it 5 stars untasted just to counteract the previous one star review which was also untasted.",

There are many ways to make different dishes and again it depends on what part of our country we live in.  It's pretty darn close to what I have used to marinate pork roasts in for several years. I'm going to try it next time I get a pork roast.  We love pork roast, well really just about anything pork.  But this recipe looks easy and tasty to me. I certainly will come back and comment again after eating it but I can tell by the ingredients and how close to what I have been doing for years without a recipe that the meat will be very tender and tasty.",
