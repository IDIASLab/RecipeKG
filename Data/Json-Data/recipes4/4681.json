This recipe was so delicious, my husband ranked it as one if the best things I've ever made AND he was looking for more when we were finished!  I made it exactly as written, with the exception of discarding the veggies and cherries after taking the ribs out of the oven.  When you work hard at it, why throw away the delicious flavor from those ingredients?  Just pick out the bay leaves and herb stems, and serve with the ribs.  Divine!  Worthy of company, worthy of family dinner, and worthy of a 10 star review. Thanks so much for a delicious dinner!",

I really browned the veg to give flavor to the stew used no fennel can't stand the stuff! I dbld the bay and used beef consomme instead of demiglace. Also used beef broth instead of chicken not sure why you would use chicken in this dish. 2.5-3h was more than enough the meat was way over done at 4h.",

I followed the advise of another reviewer and used a jar of Trader Joe's morello cherries with their juice instead of the cherry cola and frozen cherries. I also left out the rosemary (I can't stand it) and the fennel. Also beef demi-glace is very difficult to find and when one does find it it is very expensive. I just used a can of beef consume which I reduced and that seemed to work fine. I couldn't bring myself to discard the vegetable and cherry solids. Why spend the money on the cherries just to throw them away? So I served them on the side. This was an incredible dish and my husband and I finished every scrap.

I made my own demi-glace (much cheaper than buying the stuff) by using a can of beef consomme and a tbsp of butter. I boiled it until it was reduced to about 1/4 cup. Then I mixed 1/2 tsp corn starch with a tbsp of water and added it the reduced consomme and cooked until thickened. I also had to used a can of pitted tart cherries - as they were out of frozen at the store. I did not use rosemary or fennel because I don't like them. I used a Pinot Noir. No reason to spend a bunch of money on Burgundy wine but spend enough so you want to drink what is leftover:)After browning the first 1/2 of the ribs it wasn't necessary to add more oil to brown the other 1/2. I also used the fat that remained in the pan to saute the veges. I gave this recipe 4 stars because it only took 2.5 hours. They would have been overcooked had I left them for the 3.5-4 hours as suggested in the recipe. Also there was just way too much liquid imo. Next time I am going to reduce the chicken broth by 1/2 and see how that turns out.",

That being said I couldn't really detect the cherry-based ingredients in the finished product. Just savory and delectable gourmet short ribs. I think next time I will decrease some of the chicken stock and add the juice from the cherries instead (recipe didn't say to add it and by the time I added the cherries there was already a scary amount of liquid in my French oven). I will DEFINITELY make these again next time for company. I served mine with caramelized shallot smashed potatoes and a green apple-gorgonzola-walnut salad. Thank you foodlover!!!!",
