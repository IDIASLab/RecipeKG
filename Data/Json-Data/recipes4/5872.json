I also added a couple chopped baby bella mushrooms that were hanging out in the fridge. I'm not sure what other's have experiences but 20 minutes in the oven and mine wasn't even warm in the middle. Mine took about 45 minutes total to get nice and bubbly; but I'm still giving it 5 stars because it tasted so good.:)",
