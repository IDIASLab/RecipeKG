I got distracted and scorched my onion paprika mixture, as quick as I could I switched to another pan and added more paprika and onion to replace what was lost, watching carefully I softened the new onion and then added the cup of water. As you see it came out beautifully no burnt or unpleasant taste and the little browning on some of the meat added to the flavor. The meat was melt in your mouth tender,and my house smelled so wonderful while it was cooking my neighbors were leaning over the fence to get a whiff.I will be using this recipe often, hopefully leaving out the scorching step.",

I was nervous about making it without any tomato paste, so I had some on standby just in case; however, I had a little taste when the meat was done cooking, and it proved to not need any tomato paste! My husband is a very picky eater, and usually when I am trying a new recipe I can't tell him because he will automatically dislike the meal. I told my husband last night that I was trying a new goulash recipe, and he ended up loving it! I will start making this authentic Hungarian goulash in place of my usual goulash meal.
