I didn't have fresh ginger or garlic so I just added some vegetable oil to the salt 1 teaspoon of ginger powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons of garlic powder. Just put it all in the pan and stir so you don't have raw chicken all over your hands; it works just as well. I didn't have shredded coconut but I had coconut milk so I used around 1/2 a can and just didn't use the water and heavy cream. I prefer to use greek yogurt when cooking indian food but that is just my personal preference I also added 1 teaspoon of Garam Masala and did not add the chile peppers. This gave the recipe a much more subtle flavor which I enjoyed I put frozen peas in it for a vegetable and served it over rice.",

The sauce reminds me of an amazing vegetable dish that I had in my local Indian restaurant. I had only 4 chile peppers and the hotness was just right for us. The instruction doesn't say at what point you must add coconut so I added at the end with cream and I used only 1/2 cup coconut. Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "A truly Delicious and fresh tasting curry. Huge compliments from my honey who enjoyed it and commended it. I made some big tweaks to the recipe here as My inclination was to layer flavor more deeply. I used mostly boneless chicken breast (a full pack) a few drumsticks and 1 thigh. I marinaded the chicken twice. Before starting with the recipe instructions I marinated first in the juice of 1 home-grown lemon salt cumin coriander asferitida pepper and garlic powder. That sat for about an hour or 2. Then I did the garlic/ginger paste marinade in a bag for about 4 hours adding more cumin coriander pepper salt. I used store bought garlic and ginger pastes. To the yoghurt (half a container of lebne style and a scoop of Greek ). I prepped the yogurt mixture in the morning to use for dinner. I added the recommended but kept adding everything to taste as I went. I went most heavy with cumin and garlic powder as I also made the suggested \"jeera rice\" to go with. I also went ahead and added some coconut to the Yougurt. I added more coconut when I added the mint leaf/coriander \"pesto\" mixture I made. Due to counter space and time I created that pesto in my nutribullet and added a small scoop of the yogurt mixture and some smoked extra virgin olive oil. This time I went sans the heavy cream to keep it lighter. Will try with it down the line for sure. We are SUPER happy with this recipe.",
