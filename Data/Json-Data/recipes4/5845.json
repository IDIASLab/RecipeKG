If you use all-breast meat, add some olive oil to the meat mixture so they don't dry out. You could also use 2 tablespoons chopped Kalamata olives instead of the tapenade. Use tzatziki sauce on top to stay with the Mediterranean flavors or use a sesame dressing with shredded lettuce for an Asian taste.",

It is similar to one I used from the site for ground turkey. I don't have a handy grill in the winter, so I just broiled them indoors on a foil lined baking sheet. Meat comes in 1 lb packs, so I used that but kept the rest of the ingredient amounts basically the same. I actually weighed out the 2 oz of feta and it came to 1/3 of a cup. I didn't have kalamata olive tapenade. So, I finely chopped 1 tablespoon and mixed with a tsp of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. For the 1 tablespoon of fresh oregano I used 1 tsp of dried. The garlic took an amount about 5 ex large cloves. Mincing the garlic was the most time consuming part of the recipe. I got 7 chicken burgers using 1/4 cup scoop at 130 calories made as written. ty",

Used grill on stove-top instead of BBQ. I might put in 50% more feta next time. This recipe would also make awesome meatballs. Thank you!",

I made the chicken burgers patties with ground chicken salt pepper minced garlic feta cheese as the recipe says but I added an egg and quarter cup of bread crumbs. I used a whole egg and only 1lb of meat so the patty was a bit sticky. If you use the full 1.5lbs or should be good. I put all of the ingredients in a bowl mixed them made the patties and set them in the freezer for about 20 minutes. I grilled them about 6.5 minutes each side since they were a bit thicker. I also added some grilled onions. I took a white onion and sliced into rings. Put some canola oil Sally and pepper. Grilled them directly on the grate for a bit little less than the burgers. Set the burgers on a bowl of 50/50 blend salad with halved grape tomatoes. Set the onions on top and drizzle with tzatziki sauce.",
