I've used raspberry vinegar before but this just did not mix with the chicken. It became so acidic and overwelming with the strange flavor combinations that when I was putting the chicken onto a plate after letting it simmer in the vinegar I literally began to choke on the steam from it. The odor of the spices and vinegar made my eyes begin to tear and my nose and throat were also began to burn. My advice DO NOT add the raspberry vinegar. Leave the chicken as it is with only the lemon pepper because it tastes great then.",

Two reviewers mentioned the rice was mushy. I made mine in a rice cooker and had no problems. On the stove you have to make sure all the liquid boils down and be sure to not stir it. If you stir rice while it's cooking it gets very sticky. The flavor on the rice is very mild but it's ment to compliment the chicken. If you want a more flavorful side dish definately skip this rice. I thought it was great though. HTH.",

Before we added the raspberry sause the chicken was actually so delicious that my friend and I were afraid that the vinager sause may just ruin the chicken entirely. We were right. Not only did the acid from the vinager sause burn my friend's eyes as she was pouring the chicken and the sause into a serving dish but the sause was not good at all. At first I didn't think it was too bad but after eating it for a while I discovered how terrible the sause was because it did not balance out with the chicken at all. We were so desparate that we actually dipped the chicken in raspberry jam which did make it somewhat better. The only reason why I am even giving this review 2 stars is because of the chicken we had made before we added the sause. I advise everyone to make that and just skip the sause unless you want irritated eyes and a bad after taste in your mouth.",
