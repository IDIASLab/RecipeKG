So when I returned to the diet again with my boyfriend we saw this recipe and were so excited to try it. We enjoyed it VERY much! We used minced garlic and sauteed them with the onions (instead of garlic powder). We used a larger medium sized squash and I think it was more than the dish called for because after adding the eggs they seemed to be absorbed which meant it wasn't as bubbly and moist as I imagined it should be. I'd like it if there was a measurement suggestion for the amount of cooked squash but in no way was it ruined. We even had leftovers which I found helps keep me on track for when you're looking for a quick lunch or dinner the next day. The flavor of the whole dish reminded me of sweet italian sausage yum! I agree with AO's comment about draining the turkey slightly. It wasn't noted so my boyfriend (who was in charge of cooking the turkey) forgot to do so and realized it when it was too late. My only other adjustment was to spoon pizza sauce over the finished slices. Definately looking forward to making it again real soon!",

If you're not actually following a paleo diet 4 oz or so of fresh Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top before baking really adds a nice flavor to it. I use fresh basil and about 2 cups of baby spinach. We also usually only have regular ground turkey on hand so I just add oregano and some crushed red pepper to it instead of buying sausage.

I only had about 3 servings of the pre-cooked turkey sausage crumbles to use which turned out perfect- cut down the time and calories a bit. I had to use spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce as that is what I had. My squash was fairly small- just 19 oz of actual 'noodles' after cooked. This was so easy and quick and delicious! I will definitely be making this again. I added up all calories/fat/protein etc with the changes that I made. Using this as a recipe for 4 servings it ended up being just 229 calories/serving with 16 grams of protein! That's a winner!!",

                "reviewBody": "I made it exactly to recipe and it came out a congealed bland mess. I like all of the ingredients separately but somehow put together not so much. I should add that although we eat healthy food routinely we don't usually eat paleo and I was trying something new. Maybe you have to get used to this type of food to appreciate it? I've had vegan stuff that the vegan people raved about that was absolutely revolting so maybe this is the same sort of situation. I don't know. Overall I would say this may not be a good choice for experimentation if you don't eat paleo. I tried a few other paleo recipes this week and they were much better.",
