I had no fresh (or tidbits or chunks) of pineapple so I used crushed. It was good but having the chunks will probably be more tasty. I also had no snow peas so I added fresh asparagus. Yum! I also added more plum sauce than was called for. I thought about adding sesame seeds. I think that might be a nice addition. I'll save that for the next time I make this recipe.
