I created this recipe because I not only wanted to make sure they looked cute, but they had to taste great too! I've been told by several people that they have never eaten a cupcake that tasted this good! Happy Baking! Add colorful pink and blue sprinkles, creative toppers etc. to these cupcakes to make them extra cute! These cupcakes should be refrigerated and can last a few days...if any are left.",

As a previous reviewer noted the filling makes at least twice as much as needed. So with 48 cupcakes I would make 1/2 the amount next time. The filling tasted very good. It is light and not as sweet as many fillings. I cut the butter cream recipe in half and I still had a fair amount left over which was the perfect amount. I got many complements on these cupcakes. They turned out very well and were not too sweet as most cupcakes with filling tend to be in my opinion. The only flaw is the excess of filling and frosting but it's easy to cut those amounts in half.",

                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe exactly according to the directions and it made too much of everything. I used the exact Betty Crocker mix the author calls for but noticed that it says on the box that one box makes 24 cupcakes. I decided to follow the recipe and use two boxes. I filled 24 cupcake liners to the rim and still had tons of batter left over. I would recommend using only one box if you use that mix. The filling made about twice as much as needed. The buttercream icing made only a little too much. While icing I found I had to put the cupcakes in the fridge and take out 2 to ice at a time. Otherwise the cake starts to stick to your fingers and come apart. This recipe took me much longer to make than it indicates but the final result was good. The buttercream icing was delicious as was the strawberry filling! I would also recommend setting the cupcakes out for a while before serving if you have stored them in the fridge. I ate a cupcake before storing and the icing was perfect. I gave one to my husband right out of the fridge and the icing was very firm. I plan to take these to share with my coworkers tomorrow and hope they enjoy them as well!",
