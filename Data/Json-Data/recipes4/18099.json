I used habanero powder instead of seasoning mix and used Tabasco Chipotle sauce. I also had to use Angostura bitters instead of Worcestershire sauce (I'm allergic to fish). I made one with an immersion blender and liked it. I ran another batch through my juicer and preferred it. If you use your juicer put the pulp into a pot of homemade beans you will be so so happy. Thank you very much for this recipe!",
