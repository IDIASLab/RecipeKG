As I didn't have his, I made this recipe pretty much as written except to adjust the proportions as I had a fifth of grain alcohol and not half a gallon.  I also squeezed the citrus fruits and really mashed them into the mixture to release their full flavor.  From some other sources, I let the honey mixture simmer for an hour to fully bring out the flavors from all of the ingredients.  It is delicious!",

One note of caution;  be sure to add grain alcohol AFTER the honey mixture has cooled a bit and is off the stove (no need to loose your eyebrows).",
