I also substituted the beef gravy for beef broth with a dash of Gravy master.  (but a can of onion soup, or beef broth with chopped onions will do just fine as well!)  The Italian salad dressing is important.  Make some of it if you have to.  (Oil, vinegar, & your favorite Italian spices)  As long as the meat is lightly seasoned, and sitting 1/3 deep in whatever liquid you concoct... having it tightly covered in foil will make it come out fine!  Be creative & use what you have in the pantry.  275 degrees for 4 hours.  Pair with any starch, vegetable & wine!  Enjoy!",

I had a brain fart and forgot to add the Italian dressing but I used a couple bay leaves & 1 teaspoon of rosemary which gave the gravy a pleasant earthy fragrance/taste! As you can see I served it over my homemade mashed taters. Very YummO!! Thank you gagirl90.:)",
