My guess the previous reviewers meatloaf fell apart is that the instructions need to say that you should let the meatloaf rest about 10 minutes before slicing. Also I baked it on a baking sheet. In a loaf pan I think the meat just sits in the fat while cooking. A definate keeper. Thanks Karen.",

I only used ground beef because that was all I had on hand. I also used fresh spinach. But to my dismay the cute pinwheel roll I put into the oven crumpled. It was a terrible sight on my serving platter. Just a big mess. Luckly it was just served to my family. The flavor was great I will try this recipie again but next time I think I will just mix everything into one loaf no fancy stuff. Maybe run the cheddar cheese through the center.",

Looks pretty tastes great!\" This was the 4th time that I've made this recipe and each time it gets better and better. I liked it a lot the 1st time when I followed the recipe exactly and just as much w/ my small changes. I use fresh spinach as well as sauteeing bell pepper and garlic along w/ the onion. I also haven't seen the need for egg and bread crumbs in the spinach mixture so I skip that all-together. We've decided that we prefer the cheese sprinkled on top of the spinach mixture rather than blended into the meats for gooey melty goodness. I've had the meatloaf \"split\" while baking and haven't determined how to avoid that (maybe I'm stuffing it w/ too much spinach and mushroom?) Regardless of how it ends up looking it always disappears from the dinner table fast.",
