In ingredients I used 2 6oz. cans crabmeat, 2 eggs, 6 oz. (approx. 20) ritz crackers, and 1/2 tsp. Old Bay seasonings, and only 1/2 cup breadcrumbs. Everything else I kept the same. I did not saute my green onions in oil, but followed the rest of the recipe the same. I would reduce the amount of oil in pan for frying. I serve with aioli. This is the best recipe I've found: 3/4 cup mayo, 3 cloves minced garlic, 2 1/2 tbsp. lemon juice, 3/4 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper. Stir all together, and chill. GREAT!!!",

I use just one sleeve of reduced-fat Town House crackers, and I combine them with the green onions, black pepper, and some garlic powder in the food processor.  I use two 6-ounce cans of crabmeat, and one tablespoon of Dijon mustard instead of the dry mustard.  \n\nAlso, I use reduced-fat mayo, and I always put in double the cayenne, as well as fresh pressed garlic instead of the garlic powder.  I then coat them with cornmeal and bake them in a 350 oven for 20 minutes, or until they're warmed through - a lower-fat alternative to frying.  Thanks for sharing!   ",

I added 1 sleeve of crushed 4 oz. toasted club crackers.  I added a bit more old bay since I am from Maryland and we M'landers like O'lbay.  I added extra garlic powder, but next time wouldn't add so much.  I used 2 eggs and about 1/2 cup of mayo.  I made these in one of those aluminum tins that you get muffins in at the grocery store.  4 muffins to a tin.  I sprayed with butter crisco and then lined the tins with the breadcrumbs.  I then just put the scoops of crab mixture in each tin (lightly, didn't pack down), then topped with more breadcrumbs and a final spritz of the cooking spray.  I baked for about 1/2 hour at 350.  WOW...these came out great except for a little too much garlic on my part.\n\nI also made an impromptu aioli sauce by just sweating about 2 teaspoons of (purchased minced garlic) in the same pan I made the green onions in.  I put this in my mini food processer with about 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cut lemon.  Wowee.....wonderful!!!\n\nLOL...I made fresh asparagus on the side.  What a wonderful, wonderful meal and I still have 2 huge crab muffins for tomorrow!!  Thanks again! I'm sure they will be smelling me at work tomorrow.",

I quadrupled the recipe (used 4 cans of crab meat) and got about 20 crab cakes out of it. I also only used 2 and 2/3 sleeves of Ritz crackers and added fresh chopped parsley for some more flavor. I also breaded the cakes with ground corn flakes instead of the bread crumbs and they came out nice and crunchy! The cakes were great but the aioli sauce made them the hit! Here is the recipe again: 3/4 c mayo 3 cloves garlic minced 2 1/2 tbsp. lemon juice 3/4 tsp salt 1/2 tsp. pepper Mix all together and chill. I would reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp though next time since it seemed a bit too salty for my taste.",

All of the spices mixed very well together, but if you arent a fan of cayenne pepper I would cut it down to a 1/4 teaspoon. I used 4 oz. of crackers and fried the crab cakes in butter instead of oil. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. I do recommend using less crackers, and frying in butter instead of oil. I got a better consistency and crispness that way.",

I'll probably try them next time with the full 1/2 lb. just to see but they were wonderful as they were. I served these with a tangy sauce made from fresh lime juice sugar fresh hot chiles and salt.

I added minced red bell pepper for color and  flavor interest. I cut back on the cayenne pepper sigificantly as well as the ground mustard to 1/2 tsp. and the garlic powder to 1/4 tsp.  I mixed up all the ingredients but folded the crab meat in  last, so as to preserve the nice chunks of lump crab meat I used.  Crab cakes should have minimal spice and just enough filler to bind the mixture.  Once mixed I refrigerated the mixture for about half an hour for ease in forming it into cakes and for the crumbs to totally absorb the egg. Once formed into cakes I refrigerated the crab cakes another couple of hours before frying them in vegetable oil, not olive oil.  I served them with \"Garlic Aioli,\" also from this site.  Five stars with the above modifcations to suit my taste.",
