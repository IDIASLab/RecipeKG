I use a can of peas and carrots or a can of veg-all. Also adding garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and a little sage will take the flavor to the next level. If you have leftover roast beef or hamburger meat, use cream of mushroom, a can of sliced mushrooms, and all the spices minus the sage, and sour cream instead of half and half and you have a killer beef pot pie!",
