I seasoned the ribs w/ onion/garlic powder, seasoned salt and roasted them @ 300 degrees in a pan covered tightly w/ foil for 2 hours. Then I drained off all the fat, mixed up the sauce and added honey, brown sugar, and a couple of squirts of our favorite BBQ sauce to it. I then poured \u00bd of that over the ribs baked it covered it and baked it for 30 min, uncovered it poured on the remaining sauce and baked uncovered at 350 degrees. They were tear away from the bone tender and extremely flavorful! With all those changes I still give credit to the recipe, it's a great one! ",

This was a good how-to-cook-oven-ribs recipe and the three other ingredients were a good jumping off point for creating a very sweet and gooey barbeque sauce. I made more sauce on the stove top (ketchup, brown sugar, ginger, vinegar, worchestershire sauce, ground mustard, a little splash of coca cola) for dipping. All in all a good recipe that yields tender ribs. I will experiment with different flavors next time.\n*** 02/03/07 Tried this with 3 pounds of bone in chicken breasts. DELICIOUS!",
