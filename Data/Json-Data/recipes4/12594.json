The only thing I did differently was to sautee the onion in the bacon grease (I don't like boiled onions) and I also used Italian breadcrumbs with a little garlic powder mixed into it. Not bad at all. Thanks!",

SO to compensate for the smaller amount of green beans I only used 6 oz of Canadian bacon and only 1 can of cream of celery soup.. It is the perfect consistency! I love the flavor that the Canadian bacon adds. Oh and rather than use bread crumbs for the topping I used crumbled crackers. Thanks for a great recipe. I can't wait to make again because it went waaaay too fast! Next time I will buy 2.5 - 3 pounds of green beans!!",

It just didn't meld into a good consistency. I think this would have been much better if the bacon was chopped instead of sliced. This recipe was nothing more than your generic Campbells green bean casserole with out-of-place Canadian bacon strips. I will probably try this again using regular crumbled bacon as this is just a regular recipe. I don't feel the recipe warranted the very costly Canadian bacon. I will also cook a little longer. I like a bit of crispness in green beans but these still tasted a bit like crunching on undercooked beans. Sorry 3 stars is all that I could give.",
