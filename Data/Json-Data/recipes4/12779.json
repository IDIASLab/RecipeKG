Not much tweaking needed...only added an extra clove of garlic.  Bacon was too soft, so next time I'll cook the bacon until crisp, remove from pan and then saute the onion, green pepper and garlic. Don't dice the potatoes too small or they'll break apart when cooked.  Would also be good with black-eyed peas.  Definitely a great tasting soup!",

In same pan (minus the bacon fat!) i sliced up one pound of lite kielbasa put cut and washed collard greens on top and let it cook down a few minutes. Added that to crockpot. To the crockpot I added 2 cut up potatoes poured 1 container chicken broth over all of it and cooked on low for 6 hours. Unbelievably delicious and even better the next day. Next time I would cut potatoes a little smaller and maybe add carrots. You don't need any salt if you make it in the crockpot the kielbasa and bacon are salty enough.",
