I made one batch exactly as the recipe stated. The milk to egg ratio was way off and left me with soggy bread After spreading the cream cheese on the hot french toast it completely slid off and was a big mess. I made a second batch using the same milk egg cinnamon vanilla listed in the ingredients but used four eggs and 1 cup of milk since I was making multiple sandwiches. I also let the french toast slightly cool before spreading the cream cheese mixture. I think in future I would spread the cream cheese on the bread and then dip in the egg mixture before cooking. That way I could serve the french toast hot without the filling running out. I used orange marmalade and it worked perfect in the cream cheese filling. I think this is a great recipe idea just didn't work as is for me.",

Any more and the bread would have been falling apart and you'd still have leftover mixture. I microwaved the cream cheese and jam for only 20 sec and it bubbled became runny and I had little chunks of cream cheese in the jam. Then when I poured the jam mixture on the French Toast for the last minute it started to spread everywhere in the pan. I think this would have turned out better if I cooked the French Toast slices first then spread one side with jam the other side with cream cheese and put the two slices together. The recipe is a nice concept. I'd like to try a method that works better for me.",
