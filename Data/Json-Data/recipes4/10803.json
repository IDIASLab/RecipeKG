Second of all how is this 166 calories per serving when just the pork chop (with zero fat) would be 174 calories? And that's before adding the soup and onion! Another lie caught \"red sauce\" handed. This recipe takes 1 hour and 15 minutes and the calories per serving is about 252 (if you use pork chops with zero fat.)

Even without the water I usually have to pour the sauce into a saucepan after the chops are done and add in some corn starch to thicken it into a gravy. We love this super easy recipe though - the chops are nice and juicy the onions are delish and the gravy somehow doesn't taste like tomato soup anymore.",
