The meat was very tender and the combination of apples cinnamon and potatoes was perfect. Next time we would add a little bit of sugar to the sweet potatoes and the cinnamon but they were still good with just the cinnamon. Thanks Jennifer!",

I tossed the sweet potatoes and apples in 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tbsp. brown sugar and threw 2 cinnamon sticks over all and removed the sticks after roasting. (It gave a subtle flavor without being overpowering.) I seasoned the pork liberally with season salt and pepper and uncovered the dish about 20 minutes before removing from the oven to brown everything. I thought the gravy was good too others thought it was too salty but I just tasted it before I poured it over the roast...you can always add more liquid. Thanks for the recipe I will definately make again!!!",

I did change it , but  only from my mistake.  I forgot to add any butter/margarine to the roast and it was still delicious - and hey, less fat!  I really enjoyed the fact that you put it together and then don't need to do anything to it while it's cooking.  I had guests over and could take the time to enjoy their company while dinner was cooking. I will recommend this recipe to all my friends.",

I did take some of the other reviewers' advice and it turned out perfect: I cut the potatoes/sweet potatoes in large wedges instead of slicing them and they held together nicely without falling apart. I also used 2 apples instead of 1. I combined some brown sugar with the cinnamon and instead of doing the bag thing I just sprinkled some of the mixture lightly over the top of all the potatoes/apples so that it wouldn't be overwhelmed with the cinnamon taste. As for the gravy I just mixed some of the pan juices with water/cornstarch and heated until thickened. The smell in my whole house while this baked was better than any candle on the market! And the mix of tastes was really great. Will definitely make again!",
