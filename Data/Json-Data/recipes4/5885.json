It was very easy to put together and the taste was fantastic. I used the equivalent of 4 egg white and 2 whole eggs and didn't measure the cheeses but I'm sure I didn't use 11 oz. and used 3/4 pound of asparagus. It produced a very full deep dish pie pan. Because my DH thinks there needs to to be meat with a meal I added diced ham to half of the quiche. I enjoyed a piece from the side without the ham. This baked up and set up so nicely that the next time I'm going to make it without the crust. Nice recipe selection this week. I served this with fresh strawberries.",
