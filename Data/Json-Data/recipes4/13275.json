For added flavor, I always sprinkle the chicken with Poultry Seasoning before covering it with the soup mixture, and I add a little bit of garlic powder, paprika and a dash of chili powder to the soup mixture to give it more \"oomph\". I almost always add shredded cheese to the top before popping it in the oven to give it some nice gooey, cheesiness.  Tastes great with roasted red potatoes!!",

Cooking at 400 for 30\" made my chicken come out rubbery - I'm not sure, but I believe cooking it at 350 for 45\" may be a better bet.  For presentation and ease of prep, 4 1/2 stars.  For taste - well, as others have said, not much there.  Very *heavy* meal - need to have a cold salad and/or cranberry sauce available.  My daughter (with 5 children) will love this;  for myself and my husband, well - it'd be fun to play around - I'd like to try with homemade stuffing, a nice homemade sauce or gravy, maybe add some mushrooms, or something - not sure just yet.  Many thanks for idea, though.",

I followed some of the other reviewers and seasoned the chicken first with poultry seasoning, paprika and garlic powder; put the chicken in the pan first, then the soup and topped with stuffing. I also sauteed some onion and celery and added that to the stuffing (mixed the cubes and the pieces). Also used chicken stock in place of the water and the milk. Cooked at 350 for 40 min. All suggestions of other reviewers. I also made extra stuffing 6 cups instead of 4. Everybody loved it!!! Thanks for this great idea!!",
