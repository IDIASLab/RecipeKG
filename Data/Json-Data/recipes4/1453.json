I love anything with andouille, chicken, and cream.  The only thing I did different was make homemade alfredo sauce instead of canned/jarred, which only took a minute (2c half and half, 1 stick butter, 3c parmesan, and 2 tbl minced garlic).  I love the cheesiness, and it is not watery like some lasagna.  You can actually get the first piece of this out without it being destroyed!  I found it to have the perfect amount of saltiness and spice.  I LOVED this recipe.  In fact I am going to get some more now!",

I just let the lasagna sit for about 15 minutes before cutting into it and it served up beautifully. This is rich I admit, but looking at the ingredients I knew I couldn't go wrong!  I also added some sweet corn to the meat mixture and it gave a hint of sweetness to compliment the spiceness of the andouille.  My husband licked his plate clean.....literally! Don't forget to scrap up all the bits left behind from browning the meat when sauteeing the vegetables since it will add to the flavor. Thanks for this recipe, its a keeper.",
