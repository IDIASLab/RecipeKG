Eventually, I realized that it needed to be covered to achieve the internal temp.   Everyone had to wait for the meal but it was delicious when served. It was flavourful and tender. The veggies were already cooked and tasted amazing too.  I didn't have mushrooms but will add them next time.   I will definitely be making this again -",

                "reviewBody": "Followed recipe as close as possible. Used some brown ale for the beer; did not have red peppers or mushrooms, so layered asparagus spears across veggies to roast while meat was under the foil umbrella. My roast was a little over 2 pounds so adjusted my time a bit as I am never completely happy with results which always tend to overcook the beef for my taste. In order to get a little more crust on the outside of my roast, I turned oven to convection roast for last 10-15 minutes. Sorry that my plating is so rustic, but I was too eager to try the results, so this picture is of my leftovers being stored/cooled for the fridge. So tender, like butter, and sweet and juicy. The garlic (plenty) always bakes/roasts to a sweet and flavorful addition to the meat. Soo EZ and sooo good. Even with leftovers still to eat., I am eager to recreate for friends!    I also posted a photo; used  an 11\" Copper Chef casserole pan.\n\nThe recipe initially uses 1/2 cup of beef broth and 3 cubes of beef bouillon  with a 1/2 cup hot water to dissolve. I imagine it is just to get a more pronounced flavor from the beef cubes with less water. I definitely would like some MORE of the broth since a lot of it disappears during the roasting of the veggies during the meat resting time. So I would use more beef broth the next time but still use the bouillon cubes. (Unless I happen to make some fresh beef stock... then.....even yummier.)",
