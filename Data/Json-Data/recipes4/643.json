I then used 2 tablespoons of miracle whip, 1 cup of plain bread crumbs, and 1\u00bd teas of Old Bay, the last two being what many others suggested. My husband tasted it and was immediately impressed. Since I've tried to make other recipes or bought store kits before, he said this is the recipe I should use from now on. But, since I like my cakes a little spicy, I think I'll use more Old Bay, or try a little dill the next time.",

The only additions I made were garlic powder and chopped green onion. Very tasty!",
