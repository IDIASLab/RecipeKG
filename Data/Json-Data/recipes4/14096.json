Sometimes we use other types of sausage such as Italian or Mexican. We usually press a couple garlic cloves into it. If we use canned clams we add the clam juice and reduce the water by that much. You can basically do anything with this recipe. It's a keeper.",

I use a 1/4 lb of fresh ground pork for flavor and fry up in a skillet with the linguica out of the casing and add to the mixture instead of cooking the linguica in water(looses flavor.
