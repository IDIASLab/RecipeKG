For a little more flavor and pizazz, after brushing the top with olive oil, I sprinkled it with coarse salt, freshly ground pepper, shredded Parmegiano Reggiano and, finally, with fresh rosemary. The bread was SO good, but not quite as thick as I would have liked for sandwiches, so in the future I will probably bake this in a 7X11\" pan rather than the 9x13.\"",

I added about 2 teaspoons of sugar to the bread machine pan to make sure the yeast could do its job, and you could not taste it in the finished product.  I also used 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of Italian Seasoning and 2 teaspoons of dried rosemary in the bread itself.  I also sprinkled kosher salt over the top of the bread along with the rosemary before putting it in the oven.  Couldn't get my 11 year old daughter to try this, but that just meant more for us!  My husband commented on how good it was but he didn't care for the salt on top so the next time I make this I may skip it, even though *I* really liked it with the salt!  I'd also like to try using this for pizza crust... would be yummy!",

I did make a few changes as suggested by others. Firstly I add warm water, 2 tablespoons sugar & 1.5 teaspoons dried active yeast into the baking pan and leave for 10 mins in the bread machine.Then I added 3 cups bread flour, 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, 1.5 teaspoons garlic powder, 1 teaspoons italian herbs , 2 teaspoons dried rosemary & 1.5 teaspoons salt. Used basic bread setting and voila, 4 hours later, freshly baked focacia. Next round I will try with fresh garlic and fresh rosemary.",

I serve this with a small dish of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  It is excellent!  My Italian Father LOVES this:). Thanks for a great recipe!!",

Did not use the bread machine, but put everything in the Kitchenaid mixer and kneaded it that way for about 5 min.  Also used Spelt flour, since I have a gluten intolerant kid, but she can have Spelt.   Was really GREAT. Will surely make again.",
