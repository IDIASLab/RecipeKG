I cheated and used 2 cans of black beans so I didn't have to go through the soaking process and I forgot to get the can of tomatos so I added a bit of ketchup for flavor. And since I used the canned beans I added about a 1/4-1/2 cup water to get the right consistancy. To spice it up a little more I added about 1 1/2 t of dry mustard and 1 t of backstrap molasses. Cooked for 3 hrs on HIGH. Turn out WONDERFUL. I will def be making this again when in the chill mood. YUM YUM.",

I added the beans and then like 3 cups of broth. I let that simmer and then I added the spices. It's simmering now and I will put the rice in soon. I can't stop sneaking tastes!! Make this one!!!",

I halved the recipe and it still made around 6 generous servings. However, in halving it, I still did 1 full carrot, 1 full (but not large) sweet onion, and 1 stalk of celery. I also did an extra tbsp. worth of red lentils because 1/8 cup hardly seemed worth it. The rice, I also kept at a 1/2 cup. It took a bit longer than 20 minutes to cook-- more like 35, really. I was out of cumin, so I used cilantro. Overall, this was delicious. I had no trouble with the beans softening up and I followed the directions listed.",

The soaking and boiling of the beans ahead of time adding the veggies partway through the cooking all took away from the ease of throwing everything in the crockpot and leaving it all day.
