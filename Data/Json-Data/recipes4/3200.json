We don't get nice large pork loins around here, but we get the 2-in-a-pack type with the both of them weighing about 2-1/2 to 3 pounds. I prepared both of them, using 8 strips of bacon to do so. As recommended below, I quadrupled the sauce (1/2 cup each of honey, balsamic and red wine, 1 large yellow onion and 2 teaspoons dried rosemary) and doubled the raisins (1/4 cup). I basted at 15- and 30 minutes then added the raisins. It took another 25 minutes to finish it to 160\u00b0 for a total cooking time of 55 minutes. Served 4 medallions each with broccoli and cheesy noodles and had enough to serve 6 or 7. Comment from the guest: \"This would cost $50 at a good New York restaurtant...and you'd get only 3 medallions!\"",

I used wrights applewood bacon and used 1/2 cup of red wine and 1/2 cup of balsmic vinegar and 1/2 cup of honey. 1 lg. yellow onion and 1 tablespoon of fresh rosemary. I left off the raisins. The night before I seasoned pork loin with salt and pepper and browned in iron skillet and covered with the sauce to let marinate over night. I used my pamper chef roaster, without foil. It took my 4 pd. loin about and hour and 15 minute. Put remaining sauce in gravy dish for individual use. Served with scalloped potatoes and Foo Foo salad.

I had to cook another 15 minutes then finally microwave it (yikes!) because the family was starving!  The sauce didn't add anything to the roast.  I had high hopes as I love everything in the sauce, but all it did was make a huge blackened mess in the pan, as I don't think any of it stayed on the roast.  The only saving grace was the bacon - what isn't made better with bacon? I won't be making this again.",

I seared in my dutch oven,removed the pork, deglazed with the marinade, put the pork back in and scooped sauce over top of it.  I cooked with the lid on the dutch oven for 1 hour.  That's how long it took for mine to be done.  Was very good!  Thanks for a great recipe! SAFETY TIP: Count the toothpicks you put in because when it's done they are kind of hidden!",

I did an ingredient search and found this recipe. I had to substitute red wine vinegar for the balsamic vinegar and red wine because I don't keep those on hand. I also had no rosemary so I substituted Italian seasoning. Also I left out the raisins...and WOW it was SO good! My entire family ate it and liked it which is very unusual around here. My 3 and 6 year old daughters kept cleaning their plate then pushing it toward me saying \"More please!\" Unbelievable! I actually thought it was very simple to make. One thing I will suggest is that before you slice it move it to a slicing platter or you'll end up with aluminum foil bits all over your roast. I think the most difficult part of the recipe was taking the toothpicks out. lol. GREAT recipe; I will make this again!",
