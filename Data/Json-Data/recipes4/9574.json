I made 2 pie crusts just like the recipe calls for and i used the top portion of the crust and sliced it in long peice and criss-crossed the top of the pie. I then brushed a egg yolk on top of crust for browning. It looked fabulous it looked better the store bought. I was so proud of it I took digital pics of it. But the bottom crust was all soggy and doughy even after a few day refridration. The apples filling was not one bit soggy to cause the bottom of the crust to come out like that. I will use this recipe again but maybe bake it for a while before I continue filling it. Thanks Brenda.",

I had some trouble rolling it without the dough sticking to the pin and the countertop probably due to my inexperience but even pieced together it looked beautiful and tasted light and flaky. Per another review I used a light egg wash and a little sugar on top before baking which added to the appearance. Baked for 50 minutes covered with foil the last 15 minutes and the results were perfect!",
