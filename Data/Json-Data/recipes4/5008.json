I only made a half batch since there\u2019s no way I\u2019d eat 4 dozen.  I used Splenda and cherry no-sugar gelatin mix.  Here are my notes:\r\n\r\n(1)  I didn\u2019t have parchment paper, but I put them on baking stones and they worked just fine.  \r\n(2)  I had a terrible time with piping them onto the stones, but that\u2019s a testament to my own inexperience with piping, I suspect.\r\n(3)  I made them smaller than the size suggested and it\u2019s a good thing because these are VERY sweet.  They actually do taste a little like cotton candy, as advertised.  \r\n(4)  I shortened the baking time since I had smaller cookies, and took them out of the oven without waiting for them to cool because I was out of time to wait for them.  They\u2019re a little crackled, but still just fine.\r\n\r\nThese ended up being bright neon pink sweet, crumbly treats.  I read that sugar substitutes wouldn\u2019t let the egg proteins get the stiffness that they need for a proper meringue and, since this is my first try, I\u2019m not sure if maybe it should have gotten more stiff than it did.  But it seemed to work out well in the end and they taste delicious!",

It seems like most of the negative reviews are from people who don't like Splenda (if you hate it and think it has an aftertaste, why make a recipe where it is an essential ingredient?) or people comparing them to traditional meringues made with sugar. I think we would probably all eat regular meringues instead if that was an option! However, for those of us limiting our sugar intake, these are amazing! BEST OF ALL? They're both sugar-free AND low-carb (something you aren't going to find in sugar-free cookies or candies at the grocery store).",

I used peach flavored sugar-free gelatin and otherwise followed the directions to the letter. The batter is super easy to make (good thing since it takes a while to get results!) and my kids even helped. Just make sure to check on these before the 1.5 hours is up BUT DON'T OPEN THE OVEN DOOR. JUST TURN ON THE LIGHT AND MAKE SURE THEY AREN'T GETTING TOO BROWN! Taste is yummy as I don't get the aftertaste using the peach gelatin and I will be making these many more times:)",

Even in a 250 degree oven they browned a little more than I liked and have a slightly bitter aftertaste a result.
