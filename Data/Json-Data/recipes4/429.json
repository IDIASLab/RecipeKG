I did make a few changes to the recipe: 1) I used 2 cans cream of mushroom soup and 2 cups of sour cream (hey--I like a LOT of gravy) 2) Added a packet of Lipton Onion soup mix 3) Added a cup of shredded cheddar cheese 4) Increased the flour to 1/2 cup Layered everything like recipe said (you don't even have to thaw the chicken breasts--I put them in frozen. After 8 hours in crock pot everything was done--chicken very tender and sauce was great. Served this with rice and asparagus--all I can say is this meal was terrific!!!!!! Try this--you will really like it!",

I make it by taking regular chicken breasts and lining a 9x13 pan and mixing one can of soup and a small carton of sour cream and covering the top. Sometimes I line the bottom of the pan with \"buddig\" beef. (the little packages in the packaged meat aisle) At first I gave it 5 stars but then after I fed it to my family - they all thought the crockpot version was not as good as the regular oven version I make. (not sure why but it turned out much juicier in the fast method. I also wrap a slice of bacon around each piece of chicken when I am using it for company or if I have bacon in the fridge - I then bake it for 45 minutes on 400 - For me - this turns out better and the family agrees. Perhaps I cooked it too long - but I took it off way sooner than the recipe called for already - so watch the time - or it will dry it out.",
