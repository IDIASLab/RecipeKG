Sort of like bread or dumpling dough. I had to add extra water and an extra eggg to get a more watery dip. I also added some splenda sugar to the mix. Secondly the pound cake was not too appetizing either. I thought it would be..but it wasn't. All in all the only thing i enjoyed was the vanilla ice cream and the sugary taste of the tempura mix that I altered. I am really sorry I had to give u a bad review. I really wanted to like it!",

I had all these ingredients on hand and am glad I didn't have to step out into the hot sun to go to the store to try something new today. I think this recipe has a typo- an extra \"1\" in the flour amount- it probably should be 1/2 not 1/2. But if you are familiar with making tempura dishes you probably already could figure that out. Adjust the flour depending on the humidity of the day and your region. A little ice in the batter will chill it shocking the batter into light crispness as it is fried.",
