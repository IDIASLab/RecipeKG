I made this a day ahead to let it sit overnight in the fridge...it got even better.  This is great hot or cold! Planning on using this on Reuben sandwiches tonight.  I had left over corned beef from last nights corned beef and cabbage...I'm willing to bet it's going to be the best Reuben I've ever had. This goes in the \"keeper\" column! Thanks onenikol!",

Definitely a keeper and will make over and over again. But first, headed back to the pot with my tasting spoon.",

I added an extra half cup of vinegar and a quarter cup of water because I used a huge head of cabbage plus a minced jalapeno 1/2 red pepper and a whole onion. I also added a tsp. of whole caraway seeds (probably a good idea) and 1/2 tsp. of mustard seed (BAD idea) and a whole tsp. of celery seed. (probably okay) and a whole tsp. of onion powder (probably okay). The mustard seed and extra vinegar kind of ruined it (it tastes like pickled cabbage) but otherwise it would have been really fabulous. I added some extra water and simmered it extra long so hopefully it will mellow out a bit. It is way too sour with the amount of vinegar I used.",
