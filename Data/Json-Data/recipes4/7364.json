I did use Spicy V8 as suggested by others plus I added one extra can of cannelloni beans but the biggest change (which again didn't alter the base recipe) was I omitted the ground beef and chunked up some polish sausage that I needed to use up and I used three cheese tortellini I also needed to use up in place of the pasta. I saut\u00e9ed the sausage and veggies (no added olive oil needed), dumped all but the tortellini in the crockpot on low for 6 hours, added chunked zucchini the last hour, cooked up the tortellini and stirred it all together and served with Parmesan cheese. Can you spell R-A-V-E reviews??? This definitely replaces my other Pasta Fagioli soup recipe!",

I also included more carrots and celery than the recipe, only because that what I normally do (try to get as many vegetables my diet as possible)  I'm sure it tastes even better the next day, but it didn't last that long around our house.
