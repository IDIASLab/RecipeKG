Since it's harvest time now, I chopped tomatoes from our garden (not pureed). Also, I used our Swiss Chard instead of spinach. \nI had dried tortellini on the shelf.  Since I wasn't sure what the equivalent quantity of that would be, I just used the entire 8 ounce bag.  It seemed to be the right amount.  \nI used only 1 Tbsp of Italian seasoning.\nEven though this made a very thick and hearty soup, my husband liked it so much that he went back for seconds.",
