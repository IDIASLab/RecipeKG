Only needed 2 minutes on each side to sear on med high cast iron, 3 minutes would have overcooked.  I used a lot more red wine than called for, which really hit the spot as the ribs were roasting.  I also added the stock over time - only about 2/3 of recommended- to allow it to reduce.  I have tried several of the rib roast recipes on this site, and while all of them have been good this one is the absolute bomb.  There are lots of ways to roast a rib, but the cast sear is THE way to go.  And the from scratch gravy is basic but it dominates - I recommend adding it to everything you serve.",

Don't expect the gravy to be thick, it's more like a very pourable \"coat the back of a spoon gravy.\"  Don't be afraid to add the beef juices to your gravy that accumulate from the resting (foil covered) rib roast.  I didn't sear the roast dry, but added just the thinnest layer of canola oil & a pat of unsalted butter to create a nice brown sear before going into the oven.\n\nOne of my dinner guest said this was the best tasting, fork licking prime rib he ever had!",

I disagree with the instruction \"130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for rare about 2 more hours.\" If you cook this to 130 and then let rest you will not have a 'rare' roast. After roasting and resting a final temperature of 130 - 135 is medium rare. I like the slow roast method but I should have seared the top fat cap longer than I did. It didn't have that crispy 'crust' that I like so much. Also I didn't use wine in the gravy because we have a couple of people who don't care for the taste of red wine.",
