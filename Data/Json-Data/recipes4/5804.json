                "reviewBody": "Wow!  This was the first time I'd tried an unrated recipe, I made it exactly as stated (marinating for 6 hours), and it was so simple and delicious!  It was very easy to prepare with ingredients you're likely to have on hand, except for maybe the goat.  We had purchased two pounds of frozen goat stew meat and made a curry with the first pound.  We found that first meal quite chewy and tough to eat because we hadn't realized that we should have stewed the goat for some time to soften it.  With this recipe the marinating combined with the stewing made the goat meat easy to eat.  The broth was lovely and rich, and rather than rice we used bread for sopping up the broth, but next time (and there *will* be a next time) I think we will use rice.\n\nThough it was very, very tasty and I do recommend it, it did seem to be missing a little something.  The flavour seemed a tiny bit unfinished, if that makes sense.  I was thinking maybe some other herb or spice was needed to round it out, but I couldn't put my finger on it.  I may have to experiment... :-)",

But the basic idea of this is perfect and you can vary it as you want.  \nHere's my changes: I tripled the recipe, so added three goat feet to give the soup broth richness as I used the meat cooking liquid only (no broth here and I didn't have time to make one). After marinating and browning I pressure cooked the meat with thinly sliced onions and water.  I made the tomato base as written, then added the meat with cooking broth and marinade.  I needed to add more water.  My family likes spicy so I did up the spices (I don't measure but used a lot of chili powder and some various masalas).  Since the meat was mostly done I just added the potatoes to cook and tasted as they cooked, adjusting the spices.  Served over rice.  This is definitely going to be made regularly for us!  YUM",

The bay leaf and ginger not to be eaten. The stew is absolutely delicious. The meat was tender and flavorful. I will definitely be making this again.
