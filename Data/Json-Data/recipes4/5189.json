Use chocolate WAFERS not Kisses. Wafers are chocolate discs sold in a bag specifically for making candy - no need to unwrap! You can buy them from craft stores like AC Moore (in many different colors!) or from grocery stores that sell bulk foods. 2. Spread out the pretzels a wafer balanced on top of each one on a cookie sheet so they are not touching - no need for aluminum foil. 3. I put mine in a 250 oven for 10 minutes.... a little longer & cooler than written here but it's really important to make the chocolate SOFT but NOT melted! 4. Press the M&M down enough to make the softened choc. wafter hug the pretzel... then let it cool COMPLETELY! (If it doesn't the chocolate will fall off when you move it.) I like to make several cookie trays full right before bed then leave them sit out on the counter overnight & put away in the am. They are wonderful holiday treats! I have made red & green ones at Christmas ones in school colors for a graduation party and at Easter: use pretzel snaps (looks like a basket weave) green wafers (like Easter grass) & egg-shaped M&M's on top. ALWAYS A HIT!!",

Don't walk away from the oven. Keep a close eye on them. Mine took about 1-1/2 minutes... I removed and you really need to let them sit for a minute before trying to place the M&M. 2)This recipe DOES NOT work with the \"filled\" kisses (cherry flavored caramel mint etc). I tried it it doesn't work. The filling just gushes out and makes a huge mess. ONLY use regular Hershey kisses or the PLAIN HUGS. 3) I recommend using Reynolds non-stick foil or a silicone baking mat. Removal is a breeze with both of these as long as you make sure they are set before removing. 4) To speed setting place cookie sheet in the frig for a few minutes but if you leave them refrigerated the chocolate will turn white. Thanks for sharing this fast easy creative recipe!",
