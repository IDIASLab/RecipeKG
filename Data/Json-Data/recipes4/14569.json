I used a mixture of butter and extra virgin olive oil and I browned the breasts in the hot skillet before laying them in a baking dish and finishing them off. My family liked this meal very much it was a nice change from spaghetti sauce with ground beef or sausage. They actually asked me to make this again soon. Next time I'll make an extra breast for my husband as he wanted seconds and there wasn't enough for him to have another.",

While the butter spray shaves off a fat gram or two I found that the breading never really gets crispy or golden brown like a true parmesan chicken. By comparison I still prefer frying the chicken in a hot skillet with a small amount of olive oil until the outside is golden and crispy (about 3min per side.) Transfer to a baking dish top with sauce and cheese and bake until the chicken is done and the cheese is melted. Also you can use Italian seasoned bread crumbs rather than using plain and adding seasonings.",

It was crispy when done and the entire family loved this recipe it is going into our regular menu rotation!",
