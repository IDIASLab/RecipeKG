As for the lack of creaminess many have complained about, while the macaroni is draining, simply had a half cup of whole milk to the pot, with a pat of butter, the grated cheese and allow to come to come to a simmer (no boil), then add the canned stewed tomatoes (you choose your personal favorite flavor) heat on medium then add the macaroni and let heat until heated through. No baking here. No cracker crumbs, no nothing else. It's a side dish at best. Once you start adding other ingredients, like onions, celery, etc., and baking it with cracker crumbs and additional grated cheese, it becomes a long drawn out process. This is designed as a one dish, \"hey mom, I can make this in my dorm room\" kind of dish. It can be made on a camping trip. STOP mucking it up with additions, another pot or pan, the requirement for an oven, etc. Gosh, way to \"not keep it simple\" many of you.",

I think its more of a mac & cheese \"jumble\" because the cheese & tomatoes never really mix and they don't coat the macaroni like a sauce as they do in traditional macaroni & cheese.
