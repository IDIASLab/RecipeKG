I added some carrots, a cup of beef broth (as there was not enough liquid to cook the potatoes and tenderize the stew meat) and lastly I thought to add some tomato flavor.  I did not have tomato paste but added 2 Tbsp of ketchup and I immediatly knew it just what the dish needed.  I had to cook it longer than 30 minutes to get the meat to a stew type tenderness.  I only used a top pie crust to make it easier.  It cut down the time in the oven and seemed perfect and not overpowering.  I would make this again but with the modifications.  My husband being more of a meat and potato guy would want it again for sure.",

Being British I used to use lamb's kidneys instead of mushrooms but they have not been available for ages so I began using the mushrooms and the pie has been a hit with everyone! I also use the rolled prepared pie crusts in a box as they bake to a very light flakey crust that many people can't achieve from scratch. Other than that the ingredients in my pie are the same and it's one of the best ever!!",

The second time I took a roast and put it in the crockpot with the onions Guinness and seasonings and let it cook all day. I used the juices to cook the mushrooms in and then combined everything. I made a package of beef gravy to top it with on our plates.Thanks so much for this great recipe! I think it will be a new staple in my house.",

Because we're trying to lose some weight we gained over Christmas I used a mashed potato topping in stead of the pastry (and reduced the amount of potato in the filling).

It came in a pint can and after reading some of the reviews about too little liquid I used all of it. I put the beef onions and beer into a casserole and cooked in the oven for about 2 hours at 300f. I did this in the morning and left the meat in the cooling oven. This made the meat extremely tender and allowed the flavor from the beer to be fully absorbed. I transferred the meat onions and beer to a saucepan and continued to follow the recipe exactly. I didn't change anything else and it was absolutely delicious! My husband had been waiting for me to make this pie for some time and he was not disappointed. He has not stopped talking about how good it tasted. This will definitely be a favorite in our family!",

(I'm from Thailand they don't make it here) Also thanks to everyone who commented because they were very helpful. I made 2 pies so I kept one pot covered and the other not. The covered pot had more flavor than the uncovered. I also used Guinness for ale and marinated the meats in Soy Sauce (it's a Thai thing) before browning it and it was pretty good. Everyone at my office is raving about it and that's saying a lot because it's very difficult to please Thai people with Western food. My British friend said it was amazing. Again thank you Mrs. L!
