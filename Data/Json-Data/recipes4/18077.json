I was mixing it with my 5yo and ended up with about 1-1/4 cups water added when I realized this was not going as planned; I fixed my error by adding flour 1/4 cup at a time until it was dry enough to knead. I've seen other recipes with just water or just milk. This has just a slight sweetness from the lactose that was perfect for my fry bread PIZZA. (Move over tacos!!) Add pizza sauce and toppings like mozzarella spinach diced onions diced tomatoes and top with more mozzarella. Stick it in the microwave for 30 seconds to melt the cheese and cut into quarters or fold in half like a taco for hand-held gooey goodness. My picky 5yo hated it my adventurous 3yo loved it onions and all.",

My recommendation would be to add the water gradually. I used a lot less water than the recipe calls for and adjusted with a little bit of flour. Now, I also rolled it for a few minutes and let it rest overnight. It helped for a much relaxed dough that was easy to roll. To give it a touch of sweetness, I added about 1 tbsp of white sugar. Fried it in vegetable oil and that was it. It was just what I was looking for! PS I also recommend to warm up the milk a bit to bring it to the same temperature of the water to prevent a sudden shock of differing temperatures while mixing the liquids with the dry ingredients. WILL make it again!",
