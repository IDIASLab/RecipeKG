        "description": "Koshary is pretty much Egypt's staple street food. You can find anything from a 2-story koshary restaurant to a man with a cart on the side of the street. It has no meat, but even the biggest of carnivores don't miss it. Filling and healthy, come see Egypt's most famous dish! Instead of French-fried onions, I use my black pepper onion rings on here. I also caramelize about 4 large onions in butter and brown sugar for about 45 minutes and have both kinds of onion on there. It really makes it over the top, but a little too much to call it the real street food of Egypt, more like the home-style kind. I hope you enjoy!",

A tomato sauce over chickpeas lentils rice AND pasta?? It sounded like a bland starchy mess to me. I was WRONG! What a great dish! Healthy flavorful filling and inexpensive. I eat meat but you are right Nooney I did not miss it here. Per my friend's suggestion I also topped off my Koshari with Tabasco and a bit of fresh lime juice. Thank you for the recipe!!",

He did try it still and he said he liked the top part the pasta with the tomato & fried onion toppings. I m glad I made it. There are a lot of steps to the recipe but I like making involved recipes from time to time. The only thing I made different was I use brown basmati rice and that cooks longer but we love that rice and we use brown rice & whole wheat pasta only but the pasta doesn t usually change the flavor very much. I was worried to fry the rice in butter I thought it was going to burn but it worked out just fine. I ve had koshary before a Filipino coworker made it once for a potluck and I ve been curious about the recipe ever since. This was different from hers but not very different. The recipe makes a lot too. I especially liked the chickpea condiment part of the recipe that flavor was really good and had a nice little kick to it.",

You other reviewers you can't have koshari without the pasta!!! I don't marinate the chickpeas. I add vinegar and tomato paste to the red sauce to make it better.",

After reading all the positive reviews I had expectations that this would be really good - It wasn't. It took a long time to make and it was Soooo not worth it. The main dish was bland and tasteless. The chick pea marinade was just plain weird and seemed totally out of place with the rice / pasta. I normally don't write bad reviews but I'm trying to save someone else the trouble of making this awful dish.",
