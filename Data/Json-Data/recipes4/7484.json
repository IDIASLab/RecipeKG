My daughter LOVED it! \nI made the following changes/additions:  \n1) I used Crushed Pineapple, instead of Sliced Pineapple (I didn't want large chunks of pineapple in it)  \n2) I added 1 tsp of Cayenne Pepper to give it a little kick (we like spicy food)\n3) I added chopped Green and Red Pepper and Onion, and sauteed them before adding them.  \nI served the Chicken over White Rice, and it was Very flavorful.  The Sweetness of the Honey Barbeque contrasted nicely with the tartness of the pineapple and the spiciness of the Cayenne Pepper. I will definitely make this again!",
