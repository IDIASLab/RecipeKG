After discovering this recipe I have made it with ham turkey ham and chicken. All have turned out great. However if you make it with chicken you will need to add more salt. As suggested I used one large can of 100% pumpkin puree out of the cake and baking isle of the store (much simpler than cutting up a pumpkin). I also buy the bag of pre-chopped kale greens rather than buying it then having to split and cut it.I never use sorrel or vinegar...mostly because I don't have any at home. It always turns out great. This is a healthy hearty soup that is perfect for a cold winter day. Since it is just me at home I freeze half of it and then put it in the refrigerator to thaw when I am ready.",
