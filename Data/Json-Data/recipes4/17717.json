I had a small 200 gram double cream brie so I halved the recipe. I did not trim the puff pastry but folded it over the top nicely instead. I baked mine for 30 minutes because the puff pastry did not seem browned enough after 20 minutes. I served it with red and green grapes apple and pear slices and crackers. It was a hit at our neighbourhood open house we hosted. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #ChristmasHosting #FacelessNoMore",
