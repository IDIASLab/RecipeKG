Although they are slightly different, i.e. white chocolate is made with cocoa butter and confectioner's coating is made with vegetable fats. Some people use them interchangeably in certain recipes, especially if it is being used for coating. I think they say the confectioners' coating melts better than the white chocolate itself. Hope this helps! :)",
