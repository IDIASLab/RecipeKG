Therefore I just made the meatballs from this recipe and still served them with the same sides - they were awesome! My husband loved them! The only thing I'd have to say is that I definitely took them out of the oven a few times to suck up the fat in the pan and I placed them on a paper towel when done to try and eliminate some more even though I used 85-15 meat. I also couldn't really taste any of the nutmeg or allspice seasonings - I couldn't tell they were there at all - I might use some more next time!",
