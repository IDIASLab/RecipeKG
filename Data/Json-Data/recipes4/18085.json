The only thing I do different, is that I use a packet of active yeast, and let the bread rise a few times before I tear it into pieces to fry. It goes good with any meal or holiday feast. We also make thicker pieces, and slice them in half to use for hamburger buns or hotdog buns. You can also stuff them before frying to make fruit pockets, pizza pockets, or just about anything you want. Also, fry bread is great for strawberry shortcake, or you can use the pieces in place of waffles or pancakes, with your favorite fruit and whipped cream or syrup on top. They turn out phenomenal! One of my family's favorite things for fry bread, is a dip that consists of  half honey and half peanut or hazelnut butter, with a little cinnamon mixed in......they're AWESOME!!! And the kids gobble em up!",

Not only does it use the minimum ingredients, but didn\u2019t soak up the oil, the dough wasn\u2019t super sticky and the frying process was super easy! The flavor was delicious as a taco shell (tasted like a taco bell chalupa, but better) and would be so versatile as the flavor is good alone but could be used for anything. Will definitely be making these all the time!!!",
