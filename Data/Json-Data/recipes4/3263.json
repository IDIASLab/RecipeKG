The coarse salt adds a texture reminiscent of a giant soft pretzel, although I must admit it was too salty for me using the recommended ratio.  The caraway seeds and salt will stick to the bun using plain water, but I found that you get a crustier top if you brush the buns with an egg wash consisting of egg whites and water.",
