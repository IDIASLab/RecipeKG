I microwaved my head of cabbage for 1\u00bd minute to make the leaves easier to remove and work with. Next time I would use chicken or vegetable stock instead of water and make it into a gravy to serve with/over the rouladen. I served this time with package gravy and rice and everyone (husband and teenage kids) loved it!!!",
