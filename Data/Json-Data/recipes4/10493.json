Basic salt & pepper also helped alot! But that being said it is one of those dishes that can easily be customized to taste spices ingredients. I subbed sliced carrots for the cabbage because I didn't want to run to the store & had carrots on hand. I will make this again with cabbage. (I know I know change a major ingred. in the recipe and still rate it...as is it is probably a 3 star recipe but I bumped it to 4 because of my subsitition). PS Also added more water than called for (about a cup more)and I cooked on 350 for about an hour. I added the sausage in the last 30 min. so that it wouldn't be too dry or burn.",
