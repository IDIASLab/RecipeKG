One thing to watch out for is the pumpkin bubbling over the sides of the dish, so I suggest either using a bigger dish or stirring more frequently after about 2 1/2 minutes. You could probably substitute 4 teaspoons of sugar (brown for extra flavor) for the sweetener if you don't have any on hand. Overall, a great snack recipe. I definitely plan on making it again.",
