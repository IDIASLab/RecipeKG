First, it should be mentioned that the elbow macaroni is not the typical elbow macaroni that most americans use...it is a much smaller version.  Secondly, the onions should be coursely chopped and fried over med high heat in about 1/4 cup of olive oil for about 15 minutes; turning often.  You could season with a little cumin and red pepper, if you like. When the onions are nice and brown, add about 3 Tablespoons of tomato paste them and dilute with about a cup of water and simmer for 5-10 minutes.  Finally, on a large tray, thoroughly mix all of the ingredients together.  (I think some Egyptians actually serve it in layers...but I find that is too much trouble for my large family).  Put the koushari on a serving tray and serve it with a nice arabic style salad, some olives and of course, Jarjeer on the side (argula...in English.  The salad is very important!  Of course, don't forget salt and pepper as you cook.  Thanks greeness024 for letting the rest of the world in on a great dish! ",

He said typically the sauce is pureed, so I blended 1 can tomato sauce, 1/2 chopped cup parsley, 1/2 cup chopped cilantro, 1 tsp of cumin, 3 cloves of garlic & 1 tbsp olive oil, then simmered it for 10 mins. I'm telling you, the flavors seem simple but the dish is AMAZING! The texture with the noodles, rice and lentils is so good. Just be sure to really brown the onions and put on top.
