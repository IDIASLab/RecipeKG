He was sadly disappointed w/each as was I since I like to impress him w/my cooking, but then I tried this w/much hesitation due to how easy it was & what do you know ...simplicity was the winner!  1. put green or red enchilada sauce on the bottom (enough to ONLY lightly cover the bottom) but PAM works too 2. Change it up by/adding chopped green peppers or mushroom in the mix, and sliced olives ON TOP after adding heavy cream.  3. use 1 pkg of tysons/oscar meyer already made fajita or grilled chicken to save time (1 heaping cup) 4.make in the morning BUT add heavy cream JUST before baking it! I still add a little taco seasoning to the chicken for added spice BUT NOT necessary.  5 Bake until it looks golden all over with a little crispy look from the heavy cream so it's not soggy inside. I eye the amount of heavy cream for this reason too ...just drizzle enough for the amount I want & I use a smaller glass dish (making 6) since that's how many we will eat but makes (8-9 heaping amounts).  My husband likes soft enchiladas and not crispy like me, so we put foil over it while baking if he's eating.  Eat with \"Best Spanish Rice!\" So easy & with ingred. always on hand, not to mention better than complex recipes!  Again, simplicity proves to be the best!",

I used canned chicken broth to cook the breasts in, plus added 1/2 envelope taco seasoning mix as the chk was boiling.  Also, I threw in some boneless, skinless chicken thighs to add some flavor.  I also sauteed 1/2 large onion and 1/2 green pepper chopped with the garlic/jalapeno (seeded)/chilies mix.  To the cheese mix, I used Jack/Colby/Cheddar cheeses; 3/4 c. salsa and 1/2 small can red enchilada sauce.  I also added the chk broth to the mix instead of water (and used almost 1 c.).  Finally, I poured the rest of the red enchilada sauce on top of the enchiladas after I used the heavy cream.  Perfect, perfect, perfect!!!  Thank you, Whit for this fabulous base recipe!  I never would have thought to make these at home and now have a blast trying out new add-ins!",

I used chicken broth when  water was called for (even to boil the chicken), added a packet of taco seasoning and some onion to the jalepenos (canned) and chiles.  I shredded the chicken, dipped the tortillas in the leftover broth before filling them.  After filling them  and putting them in a sprayed dish I sprinkled the cheese on top(I used Pepper Jack), poured the cream over that and then a can of enchilada sauce.  I covered them for 30 minutes then uncovered them for 10 minutes.  Waiting 5 minutes to serve helps it set.  Thanks for posting this recipe and for all the recommended changes.  I will be making this again and again.",

                "reviewBody": "I had to improvise on this a little but not enough to really change the recipe. Shredded rotisserie chicken made this super easy and since I had no jalapeno peppers or green chiles Pepper Jack cheese made a fine substitute. I spread a thin layer of tomatillo sauce on the bottom of the baking dish before placing the enchiladas and put a little in the enchiladas when filling them as well. Just before serving I topped them with some chopped tomato and a dollop of sour cream. The final result was okay but in my view needed more sauce (cream) than was called for and would have been very dull without the addition of the tomatillo sauce and sour cream. If I make these again I'll know they'll be better with some embellishment. As written these are just so-so and a little boring.",

                "reviewBody": "Although the basic recipe seemed workable, I approached it with some reservations because of other posted comments. A few changes seemed to help. I sauteed a small onion (finely diced) with the peppers and garlic. The filling was still a bit bland so I added a handful of fresh chopped cilantro, salt, pepper and a good squeeze of lime juice. I also substituted heavy cream for the water. I then added an extra step that takes a few minutes but, in my opinion, improves the texture. Pour some of the cream in a shallow dish. Heat a small amount of oil in a skillet. Quickly fry the tortillas, flipping over after a few seconds. Dip each fried tortilla into the cream - then proceed with filling and rolling. Then use the cream as stated in the recipe (I increased the amount to 1-1/2 cups to minimize the chance of this drying out). I covered the dish with foil and baked it for 15 minutes, then removed the foil for the remainder of the baking time. Pretty good overall, with the suggested changes.",
