All I changed was substituting out half of the lard and replacing it with butter for more flavor. As with any biscuit recipe, you want to make sure your fat is cold. My lard had been in the freezer and my butter was cold from the fridge. It's also essential that you don't overwork the dough. I found chef john's buttermilk biscuit techniques very useful (the video is on allrecipes).",

That said, Sadie\u2019s Buttermilk Biscuits was a great recipe to try it out on \u2013 it\u2019s obviously a dependable and quite forgiving recipe! Lard is the best for pie crusts in my opinion, but when it comes to biscuits, I like the taste of butter, so I made that substitution.  The biscuits were light and rose tall and fluffy.  They just didn\u2019t brown on the bottom as much as I would have liked, but again, this was my first attempt with this pan.  I have no doubt that made on the cookie sheet I am familiar with, or once I master the cast iron biscuit pan, they\u2019ll be perfect.  The fact that Hubs requested ham sandwiches made with them for his lunch tomorrow is a great testament to them. Update: I believe I have determined my \"problem\" and it is not with the pan.  The recipe calls for the biscuits to be cut to 1\" thickness and I believe this is too thick -  should be 1/2\" thick. Also, the dough was a little too wet - start with 1-1/2 cups of buttermilk - you can always add more if necessary.",
