Awesome stuff, he said. As usual, I made some adjustments & additions but the recipe, as written, proved to be a great foundation.\nI took a chance & found a more than adequate substitute for the 'gritty' masa to thicken the soup. Other recipes mentioned using torn up unfried corn tortillas (I used about 5 small tortillas-probably few more next time). I don't have a need for any extra masa so the tortillas worked beautifully. They practically dissolve, giving a lovely texture. Be sure to add additional cup or so of liquid. It can be stock, water, V-8 or beer, of course. I may try tequila...I encourage all of you non-gritties to please give this recipe another chance nixing the masa for tortillas. Trust me & Karen.\nAccording to our tastes, I added sauteed onions, chopped fresh jalapenos, black beans, corn & I added some red cayenne pepper, about 1/3 tsp. Be careful-cayenne is hot so add sparingly. It really wakes up the flavor & it makes your tummy warm & happy. Souper Recipe (ha)! 5 Yums Up!\n",

I like others could not find \"Masa Harina\" so I bought something called Maseca......it's what you make corn tortillas out of and it worked great it really gave it that authentic Mexican flavor. Next time I will definately use all chicken broth instead of water. It would be great adding a can of tomatoes or green chilies....it's so versatile you can do anything to it! We topped ours with extra shredded cheese & sour cream.......yummy!",

                "reviewBody": "Absolutely fantastic recipe!!!  And additional thanks to the reviewer who suggested using corn tortillas instead of masa harina.  I've used six tortillas and I've used 10.  It's all good. The right enchilada sauce makes all the difference; for authenticity I recommend Las Palmas medium or hot red sauce, if you can find it.  I grew up with this stuff in Southern California, and although harder to find back east it's still possible.  The enchilada sauce-to-water ratio is spot-on as long as you select a quality sauce.  Don't be afraid to use more garlic, 4 or 5 cloves is about right with half of a large onion.  I made this recipe a few different times, and I discovered that you do not need to add cheese during the cooking process.  It's really not necessary for thickness (the corn tortillas are), and the cheese just globs at the bottom and sticks to the pot.  Just add mild cheddar cheese with the rest of your garnish, fresher is better, and you require less cheese (healthier too).  A squeeze of lime in the bowl, some fresh cilantro, some thinly sliced jalapeno, etc., and you're in business!!! I've seen reviews where others keep adding more and more stuff (even beans and Velveeta), and it seems they are trying to create a thicker chile or a dip rather than soup. The goal should be an authentic, light, simple enchilada soup of top fresh quality, so use the right sauce to begin with, keep it light, and enjoy life without clogging your arteries.  Avocado salad makes a great side.",

I do want to add that this is a great recipe that you can tweak to your own tastes and end up with a fabulous soup. I made as written the first time and while we liked it I felt it could be better so I took the left over soup and added to it as some reviewers suggested 1 can of rotel tomatoes 1 can of mexicorn and added 1 additional tsp. of chili powder and 1/2 additional tsp of cumen. I also feel that 1 full cup of Masa Harina is too much I will use 1/2 cup next time. Give this one a try you will not be disappointed! My Son said it tasted like Chili's only better with the additions. Thanks for sharing.",
