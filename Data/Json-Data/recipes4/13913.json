I didn't add to the meat, simply browning up well seasoned burgers, then removed from pan, sauteed the onions and some mini-Bella mushrooms, added the soup, more water than called for, and the Worcestershire sauce and then returned meat to pan and simmered as directed.  Served with mashed potatoes and greenbeans and while not visually appealing, it certainly hit the spot.  Will likely make again.",
