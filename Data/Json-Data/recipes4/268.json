This helps to avoid the sogginess you often get.",

Instead of 4 eggs I used 6.  I used AT LEAST 1 1/4 cups of milk (for fluff and moisture), no meat (although next time I might put black forest ham in it), I filled a cereal bowl full of cheeses-2 to 2 1/2 cups(swiss and cheddar-more cheddar than swiss), only 1 heaping t. of flour (it does clump up, but you cant tell in the final product), I added a little cumin, basil, and rosemary, a pinch of nutmeg, and LESS than 1/4 t. of thyme.  I also added garlic salt and finely chopped red nd green peppers.  I am not a fan of tomatoes AT ALL, but I added about a handful of chopped tomatoes and threw them in last to the mix.  I did not use a pastry crust.  The rest of the recipe I followed exactly.  I poured it directly in the pan, and cooked for the 45 minutes.  It rose about an inch above my pan, more on the sides, so I gave it a few more minutes for the middle to rise as well.  After I removed it, It shrunk back down.  I made this the night before and stuck it in the refridgerator.  TO REHEAT I moistened a paper towel and draped over desired slice to microwave for about 1 minute..... Just like fresh out of the oven!",
