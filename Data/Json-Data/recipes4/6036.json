And since my futile attempts at fixing Mr.Cuckoo had reached its end, the missus had to make new rice and let it cool for a few hours. Enjoy this fried rice with kimchi and other Korean side dishes.",

It just seems people don't respect the individuality of Asian cultures and their cuisines and try to view all things Asian in this fusion heavy sort of way. Its not all the same, folks. Chinese fried rice is notably different from Japanese fried rice which is still different from Koream and Thai and so on. Every Asian nation has its own unique take on dishes such as fried rice and it ain't all the same thing. Take heed that changing green peppers to peas isn't just a simple matter of preference, you're going from a Korean dish to a Chinese one. If you like to eat this way, thats great. But at least acknowledge that what you're doing isn't strictly Korean anymore and the fried rices of eaxh country are all that much different. Same goes for the inclusion of egg drop soup on the side- its perfectly fine but at leasr habe a bit of acknowledgement that its Chinese. You're pairing a Chinese soup with a Korean dish. Peace.",

This was so \u201cD\u201d good it\u2019s only the guilt factor and the fact that I like him that\u2019s preventing me from scarfing up his portion too.  As is my preference, I used peas and carrots rather than green bell pepper, corn and carrots, and in the interest of being carb-responsible, less rice than called for in proportion to the shrimp and vegetables.  I loved the addition of the oyster sauce as well as the soy sauce, which gave this fried rice a little more complexity in flavor than most.  As for the egg, as I always do when I make fried rice, I cooked it as a crepe, rolled it up like a cigar, then sliced it into ribbons, chiffonade style \u2013 much prettier.  (I learned this from a wonderful Chinese cook many, many years ago) I did not top this with the optional fried egg \u2013 this was just perfect without it.",

I did prepare the scrambled eggs thin and crepe-like and then made a chifonade of them - The presentation was just like at a restaurant! Oh and for a little added zing I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of Sriracha sauce in step #3. All in all I had a great time with this recipe and everyone thought I was a genius!

I usually make Chinese style which is good but these flavors and the fried eggs put this over the top! Everyone (including my 7yo DD) cleaned their plate. Ten stars as is. I did change the method from the recipe but not any ingredients. I dislike pan washing (who doesn't?) so I used a large cast iron pan and just scooted everything to the outside to scramble the eggs in the same pan. They cook in less than a minute and you just stir up together. I also used precooked shrimp so I added the onion and garlic after the first five minutes then added the thawed shrimp and corn for another two. The combination is ideal and I recommend against changing it especially the fried eggs. Kudos mykoreaneats!",
