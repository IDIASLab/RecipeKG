The second time, I added a chopped medium onion and used hot Italian sausage, came out great. Definitely follow the directions on cooking the gluten free pasta. The recipe calls for a 12 oz package of gluten free elbow mac, by mistake I picked up an 8 oz package from the store ( Barilla gluten free mac was not available in my store) and it turns out, this was plenty of macaroni in the soup for me. Definitely a keeper recipe!",

I understand that boiling the sausage gives it the firmness to slice it but I have done that in the past in soups and ended up with spongy sausage so I chose to cut the sausage out of the casing roll it into mini meatballs and brown them in the skillet until I rendered enough fat to saute my mushrooms in. How can it get any easier than throwing the pasta in to boil for 4 minutes and then turning the stove off and letting it sit for 10 minutes?? Add some extra herbs/seasoning top with parm and you have yourself a winner here. Barilla beats all in the pasta world!",
