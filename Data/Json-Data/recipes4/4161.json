Added extra fennel and dried basil decreased the salt to a single teaspoon of coarse sea salt and added a bit of sugar to cut the acid of the tomatoes. Instead of half and half used a block of lowfat cream cheese and a cup of skim milk and then hit it with the immersion blender. Ate it with grilled cheese sandwiches. Husband was pleased! Will definitely make again.",
