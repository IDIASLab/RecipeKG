Only change I made was I use 2 cups of red wine instead of 3. I used a Cabernet Sauvignon.",

I liked how the seasonings were in this, unique and fresh, I left out the rosemary and added fresh basil although I made sure not to add more basil than I did oregano.  My sauce was a bit salty, so I added probaby 4-5 tsps of sugar, I think the saltiness comes from canned tomato.  In the future I may use a can of crushed tomato which I think would create a consistency I prefer. For heat I added some sliced up italian sausage which I added raw to the sauce and let cook along with a little crushed red pepper.  I used two cups of red wine, that was plenty.  Simmer it an hour at night, and then leave it over night to simmer another few hours the next day.  Went great over Rigatoni.",

Even after being fully cooked down and 3 full days of the flavors blending the wine taste and smell was still strong with your first few bites. (until you get used to it again)  We only made it once so it's possible that a wine less body would be al that is needed.  Thanks for giving us this new recipe to try.",

For the people who found the sauce a little \"winey\", the key is to let the wine reduce when adding it to the sauted vegetables.  I also used 1 large can of tomato sauce, 1 large can of tomato puree and 1 large can of crushed tomatoes, just to get some different textures.  I also used fresh thyme, rosemary and oregano, which I put in with the wine.  Towards the end of the simmering, I added some cumin, crushed red pepper flakes and a pinch of cinnamon.  It makes a ton of sauce, but freezes well :)",

I especially like using this sauce when I'm making the Baked Ziti 1 recipe on this website which uses provolone and sour cream. Absolutely delicious!",

Instead of using 3 cans of tomato sauce I tried cans of italian peeled tomatoes and adding a green pepper.I made meatballs for the sauce too and let them simmer and thought it came out excellent.Next time I will try some Italian sausages.",
