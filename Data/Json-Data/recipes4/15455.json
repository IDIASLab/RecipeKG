It takes about five minutes to whip up and your house smells fabulous while doing so.  It's just the right amount of cinnamon.  In reading the previous reviews, a few people have commented on the texture...ironically enough, the texture is one of the things I enjoyed most about this recipe.  It actually feels as though it has some body, unlike plain Jello dishes. Five stars for me without a doubt!",
