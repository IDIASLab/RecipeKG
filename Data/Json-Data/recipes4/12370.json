Have enough for about 4 more meals - so in the freezer it goes....awaiting a chili cold night.  I have made the other kind before where you add the ranch dressing mix and this recipe is so much better!  Enjoy! ",

Here is how I tweaked the recipe to suit our tastes: I used beef kielbasa, 4 large cloves of garlic, 1 very large onion, 1 small can of tomato sauce to give more body, and I used chicken broth instead of water. I skipped the mixed vegetables as we had enough veggies with the potatoes, onion, corn, and pinto beans. I did not use the cumin and used just the chili powder--regular and ancho. I think next time, I will skip the potatoes. Yum!",
