The original traditional tangy taste calls for tamarind, but lime or tomato is definitely acceptable. Add excitement to your Sinigang by adding prawns, 1/8 cup sliced red onions and 1 tbsp shredded ginger. Some greens like bok choy, or even anaheim pepper (long green pepper) is also good. Since this is soup, I usually add the green veggies sparingly in order not to overpower the character as a soup.\n\nSince this is a cultural food, you can deninitely adjust the spices according to your orientation.",

I used normal cabbage because there was no bok choy at 2 stores and I used a tamarind soup mix that I bought in Dallas TX. I liked it considering I am a filipina and actually know what it was suppose to taste like. Not like my grandma's though but I'm sure if I had all the ingredients this dish would have been just like grandma's. Also I would try adding some MSG and a few slices of ginger because grandma cooks it with EVERYTHING!!!",

We found this recipe and have made it twice once with lime juice and once with tamarind. I liked both versions but the lime juice was especially good. I added salt and apple cider vinegar to kick it up a notch. Also substituted brussel sprouts once and broccoli once for the radishes. This will become a staple in our house even after we are finished with the diet! Next I am going to add fresh ginger curry paste and fish sauce to round out the flavor.",
