I can't really say I did things differently I did stick to the recipe but as I only had Tomato & Basil Feta and a 4.25oz can chopped olives I used them & removed the seeds from the tomatoes before chopping. Follow the recipe to a T. At 1st I thought the white vinegar was going to over power the ingredients but I was totally wrong. This recipe worked there was a pleasant and nice zing of flavor & my use of the seasoned Feta I had...did enhance the recipe thoroughly. I seriously doubt I will use plain feta in the recipe at all. I totally will make again and Will look for the Tri-colored cheese tortellini for the next round. Can't say anything bad about the recipe....and surprisingly..the walnuts work too! Go figure.
