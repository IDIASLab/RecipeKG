I must say that a bunch of fresh cilanto can be a bit subjective and in my opinion \"overkill\" so add it to suit your tastes. I only added a couple of Tbsp. chopped. I put everything into my mini food processor and let it go.... then put it in the fridge for a couple of hours to let the flavors blend and it went great with warm tortilla chips!",

Since they gave it the Cilantro and the Lime Juice I didn't need to add those two ingredients.
