And they're perfect for when you want french fries withou the \"fry\"! I added a bit of dried crushed rosemary to the mix and since I didn't have fresh parsley I had to substitute a bit of dried. These smelled great in the oven and tasted even better! When finished I seasoned them with Parmesan and instead of the seasoned salt I opted for a bit of sea salt. These were the perfect side dish for grilled burgers! Thanks for a great recipe Sarah! One I'm sure we'll make again and again...",
