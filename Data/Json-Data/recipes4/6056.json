I had one 14 oz. salmon steak so I used less oil and mixed the oil with the spices (and 1/2 tsp dried thyme didn't have fresh) to make a kind of paste. Used garlic and onion powders rather than salts to cut back on sodium. Cut up a handful of spinach in a kind of rough chiffonade to get the same green-dotted look with Parmesan on top. Served on top of more spinach lightly sauteed and tossed with pasta and Parmesan. Yum!",

My salmon pieces were tall and skinny and the spinach just wouldn't have sat right on top as well as everything else. The toppings created an amazing crust on top of the salmon and I got rave reviews. Really quick and easy.",
