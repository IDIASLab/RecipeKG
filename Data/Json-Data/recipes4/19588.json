This ramen noodle takes your traditional hour or so of hand kneading down to minutes. I have made this for a quick breakfast many days and my family loves it. It's not the traditional ramen noodle because it has uses an egg, but it tastes Asian with the sesame seed oil. You may be like my family and like this recipe even better.",
