Then top the coated pasta with any remaining marinara sauce. -- Meanwhile, roast the zucchini & onion slices (one onion). -- Top pasta with zucchini & onion mixture, then a good parmesan cheese. --- I lastly sliced lengthwise 3-4 roma tomatoes to place on top, salt & pepper and/or Mrs. Dash garlic seasoning.
