Next time I'm going to stir in some chopped walnuts as well. I used less pb and no oil in order to save a few calories. I used plain old fashion rolled oats instead of instant. The most important instruction would be to make ahead of time and chill well. At room temperature it's still a little \"beany\" but refrigeration takes care of that and allows the flavors to meld. We loved this as a dip for apple slices.",
