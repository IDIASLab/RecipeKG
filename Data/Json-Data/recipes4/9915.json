Well, not only did it satisfy the ingredient search, but the tummies of me, my fiance and his hard-to-please-teenager son.  If a 15-year-old asks for you to make it again, you know it was a hit!  So, thanks for this recipe.  I altered this to a crock-pot version, and skipped the corn starch phase.  By making it in the crock pot, it's now a quick and easy meal and it's ready when everyone is back from work.  I also served it more like a pot roast and served it with a side dish of elbow macaroni and used the sauce from the crock pot as it's gravy and then had some hard italian bread and it was totally yummy!",

I also made spaghetti with the left overs and it was great.  I also took slices of the roast, put them on kaiser rolls, and melted slices of mozzarella in the oven.  Awesome leftovers!  Will be making this again when I have a busy day and will probably cook it for 8 hours on low next time.",
