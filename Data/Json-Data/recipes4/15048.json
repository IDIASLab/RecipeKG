I feel the microwave damages the texture of the roll.\nI always mince the onions very finely before cooking them in the sauce. Build a texas wiener, dog on the bun, smear of French' mustard, add sauce then the onions last. Voila!",

I started with 1 whole large onion diced into bits sauteed with 1 cup water for 30 minutes. Chopped only 4 hot dogs and added to mix. Cut water down to 3 cups total. Number 2; I also mixed 1 tablespoon yellow mustered into mix. Cut cinnamon down to a pinch. Less liquid so I also reduced cornstarch to perhaps 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons dissolved in an additional 1/2 cup cold water and added just enough to thicken sauce. Thickened sauce should be tkick enough to cling to dog yet thin enough to flow around dog into the bun but not drip excessively. Remainder the same.",

'Found them again in the eighties on Albany Av. in Kingston when I worked up there, then, the son of the original owner of the Newburgh Tx Wieners opened up 5 miles away in my own town after he closed the old place on Broadway around 2000 (?).  I made it a few mos. ago and handed a sample to my son and his eyes lit right up.   Here's a tip: those dogs go best with chocolate milk.  One little cardboard carton for two dogs, two if you're having three dogs. Don't laugh! Try it!   One more observation to share:  if you're looking for this sauce, and browsing other recipe's for it, look for the cinnamon. If it's not in there, you're done before you start.\nCheers...., Fred",
