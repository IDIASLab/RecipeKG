I think next time I will double it.  I would make two suggestions for anyone making this dish.  First, make sure to chop the onions finely.  This way they incorporate into the sauce better instead of having big chunks of onion floating around, resulting in a strange texture.  Also, when the chicken is cooked, tent it under foil to keep it warm and seal in the moisture.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.",

I put 2 cups heavy cream, 1/2 cup water, 1 cup milk, and I still had to add another 1/4 c. heavy cream w/ some flour mixed in to thicken it up. But after that, it was absolutely incredible. And the chicken also comes out softer if you use thighs and other parts rather than breasts in my opinion.",

                "reviewBody": "Awesome awesome recipe! In fact, the best I've had on allrecipes yet! I strayed pretty far from the original recipe so I apologize to the Chef but it turned out just awesome. First, I cut the chicken in small strips then dipped in an egg wash and coated in a flour/Italian bread crumb mix with paprika, black pepper, oregano, sweet basil, and salt. Then I fried with onions and minced garlic - it turned out incredibly yummy. Then set aside the chicken and use that pan to simmer additional onions, red peppers and chicken broth. In the meantime I prepared the asparagus: arrange so tips are even then rubberband and blanche in hot water for 1-2 min until bright green. Put in cold water to stop cooking then arrange in an even layer on cookie sheet. Lightly brush with olive oil and then salt. Cook for 5 min in 400 degree oven until sizzling. Then cut into 1 inch pieces and throw into the skillet with the chicken, red peppers, etc at the very end. I also found it needed a lot more sauce and probably would've doubled the sauce. (Of course I added more stuff too so I definitely needed more.) I hardly used any milk mainly the heavy cream in the sauce. Breading the chicken and mixing it in with the sauce and pasta helped thicken the sauce a bit as well (I did mix everything together at the end). I know a lot of reviewers said the sauce was a bit runny. My husband and I about died when we ate this it was just so incredible. We're looking forward to the leftovers for dinner tonight!!!! Thank",

I loved the presentation and everyone LOVED the flavor!!! \nI did double the sauce ingredients as I was afraid there wouldn't be enough and it came out perfectly.

Fresh mushrooms would be good in this too.  This is a great base recipe thanks for posting!
