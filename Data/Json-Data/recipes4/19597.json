Instead of Thai garlic chili paste I used my favorite curry powder blend. I also used two cans of coconut milk instead of the one can of coconut cream and water. It gave it a really rich flavor and wasn t watered down. I added cooked chicken breast at the end and served it over a bowl of sushi rice. I served it with a squirt of lime juice and fresh herbs on top. My new favorite dish!:)",

Next time we\u2019re going to add cauliflower, red peppers, and mushroom. Could be good with pad Thai noodles too.",
