I did NOT use water and I did not boil anything. I simply mixed all the ingredients. The trick to make it puff is to really knead it. Without water it makes a very thick dough that you can knead some more and then roll into little balls. It takes only 15 minutes baking on a greased baking sheet. Do not let it brown.",

Turned out it was really cheap too like 1. I will say that I grated my own parmesan from a block and it was a little strong. Next time I will try the parmesan from the green bottle or just reduce my own grated and up the mozzarella. There will definitely be a next time!",
