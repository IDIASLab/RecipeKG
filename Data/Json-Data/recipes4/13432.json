I do like a thicker base so I make a roux but overall this recipe really hits all the flavors. I also serve over white rice and serve either corn bread or french bread to sop up the juices. I find that using a thick cut smoked bacon works best. Sure you will spend 3 more for the better quality bacon but I think it's worth it. Check out this users crawfish pasta as well...I have not made it yet but it is similar to my mom's recipe and hers is divine!",

Also I made a roux with the butter before adding to thicken sauce a bit since others commented on the wateriness. Great over rice and with skillet cornbread.",
