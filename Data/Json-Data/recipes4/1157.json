I only used as much of the seasonings as I felt comfortable with, probably half of what was called for. Along with the salt (I used Kosher), garlic powder and pepper I used a Tuscan seasoning blend that I just love, and the flavor came through noticeably but subtley. I pierced the potatoes before wrapping in foil but because of the butter did not pierce the foil - didn't want any of that good, seasoned butter to seep out! Unfortunately, the long cooking time on the grill turned the seasonings very dark, so much of it had to be scraped off.  In the future I'll precook the potatoes in the microwave for a minute or two, then finish them on the grill. ",

The only thing I'd recommend is poking the potato before wrapping, and then poking the tin foil, we ended up with little bits of tin foil in the potato doing it all at once.

Even DH was talking about them a couple of days later and says they get \"thumbs up\" which is high praise from him since he's pretty spoiled by my cooking! I DID lessen the salt (trying to behave!) and didn't try the italian seasoning this time but the flavor was absolutely excellent... my charcoal grill was jacked up to about 600 degrees with the lid on so the potatoes took less time to cook but didn't burn and were tender and flavorful through the entire potato. I was cooking steaks too so built the fire on one side of the grill and put the potatoes on the opposite side from the fire. Perfect!! I will make these again and again maybe trying different seasonings. Thanks for a great recipe Leslie!",
