I've made it at home too it's relatively easy and the main trick is to have REALLY crispy bacon blot it well after frying and before dipping or brushing on chocolate and I've found thin-sliced bacon works best thick-sliced tends to get tough after cooling. At Marini's they make it with both milk chocolate and also DARK chocolate WOW! Now THAT'S a party in your mouth!",

A variation on savory/sweet bacon in to fry your bacon very slow and before it's done drain the fat and then add (approx. 1/2 cup per lb bacon) honey and continue cooking until the bacon is well done. You want to cook this slow so the bacon doesn't crisp up but stays chewy. Great for breakfast or on top of salads.",
