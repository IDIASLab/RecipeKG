I love to cook with beer and wine and we were given a nice big bunch of collards from a friends' garden. So I thought \"what the heck!\" So so so glad I made this recipe. I've made it three times so far in two weeks. I double the cayenne since my wife and I like things on the spicier side. I used chicken broth for one meal and used vegetable broth for another. All depends on what you like. Both can be used. I think the ingredients that really have a major effect on the flavor is the bacon and the beer. I used a Stout beer for my dish. Nice and foamy and thick. Great great flavor. I also used 'real' peppered bacon from my local butcher. Not that Oscar Mayer. (My apologies to Oscar Mayer but there is worlds better bacon out there.) =) THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE! It is easily in my top 10.",

I changed two things in the recipe: I ended up using a package of salt pork instead of the smoked pork chop (the brand I use isn't very salty and ends up more like a thick cut bacon) - the other thing was to add about 6 drops of Chile Oil to my browning onions. I like my food a little spicy and this did the trick. This recipe is very easy and even my friend who hates cooked spinach like this.",
