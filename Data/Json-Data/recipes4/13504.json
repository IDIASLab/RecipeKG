For those that don't know of it, it is like corned beef (and cabbage) brisket.  Salt beef  is sold as \"Naval beef\" in  5 and 10 lb plastic tubs filled with brined chunks of beef in the chilled grocery section. Make sure you soak it well for a number of hours to remove the salt (change the water mid way if you really want to remove all salt).  I prefer it a bit salty, because the way my mother would always cook it. Thank you Carolyn. (Any chance for Fish and Brewis?)",
