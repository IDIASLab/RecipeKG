I did microwave my squash a bit before baking so it would be easier to cut in half and get a jump start on cooking so it didn't take as much time for it to cook as the recipe said because of that. I only made 1 squash (2 halves) and eyeballed the sauce. This was really fun and I liked the minimal cleanup. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
