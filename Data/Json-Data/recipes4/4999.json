I ended up melting the butter and marshmallow fluff in the microwave in a big pyrex bowl then stirred in the crunched up fritos. I put that all in an 8x8 pan and pressed down with parchment paper. I left them loosely covered with foil overnight and everybody loved them the next day at work! I'll definitely be making these again.",
