I mixed the pumpkin ( I used about 20 oz) with the onion and garlic and then added enough chicken stock and half-and-half to make it the proper constistency (no where near 2 C chicken stock). I used only a pinch of cinnamon and it was still way too much tasted like pumpkin pie. I ended up making it a little too spicy trying to mask the cinnamon taste. Just before it was finished I mixed in about 1/4 C fresh grated parmesan and about 6 oz skim ricotta that I needed to use up. This would have been a five-star recipe without the cinnamon which is how I will make it in the future. Thanks!",
