I use 6 cups of flour, and can make 40-50 4-inch or larger pierogi.  We roll a ball (fits in 2 hands, not too big) flat, then cut it into squares.  We then rolleach square individually as thin as possible, put in about a tbs. of filling, and fold corner to corner.  When pinching the edges, you have to smear and smudge a bit.  I'm sure every family has their own recipe, but this way you don't have soooo much dough in each bite.  I also jazz up my filling with browned onion, s&p, and sharp cheddar. ",

I have been using Farmer's cheese in my filling for over 20 years and I think it makes a huge difference in taste.  This was the preference of my Ukrainian gramdmother, too.  Also, I sautee finely chopped shallots in butter and add those to the filling as well.  It adds more flavor than the onion salt (I think).  The easiest way to fill them is to use a round biscuit cutter.  Take the round cut out pieces and give them another quick roll in each direction and they will be ready to fill.  Also, to seal tightly without having them leak, I keep a teaspoon in a bowl of water and very lightly moisten the inside edge with the side of the spoon before doing the \"flour pinch\" to close them.  They freeze extremely well, but don't forget to separate the layers with either plastic wrap or wax paper!  Any way you look at it, these are DELICIOUS!  I can never get enough of them.",

Don't use a mixer to mix up the potatoes ... use a RICER and pass all the potatoes through it, then add the cheese and whatever seasoning (I use garlic powder).  Mix with your hands until the mixture changes color.  Also, don't fool around with the wet spoon to seal the edges.  User your fingers.  Isn't that part of the fun of cooking??? Let the dough rest covered at room temp before making circles.   Keep the size of the dough you are working with to about the size of a grapefruit.",
