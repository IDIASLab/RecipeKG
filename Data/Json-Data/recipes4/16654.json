In fact, one time I ditched the idea of making burgers altogether and used the mixture as a sambousa filling. Those were tasty! Despite the failures of this recipe, I have now made them four times tweaking the ingredients each time. I've added an extra egg the last three attempts and resorted to using two spatulas to flip them to try keeping the burgers in one piece start to finish. Next time, I will add a few tablespoons of flour like another review suggested.\n\nThe reason I keep coming back to this recipe is the flavor as I am in the habit of cooking lentils with dried onion (1/2 t) and red chili flakes (1 t). This makes a world of difference for the flavor. I even keep a bowl of lentils like this in the refrigerator as they add a little protein pop of spice to salads.\n\nAlso, I make them for my vegetation daughter, who eats one at a time, so I freeze the rest between sheets of wax paper. I reheat them from their frozen state in a small glass pan given a light coating of nonstick cooking spray. Then, I pop it in a 400 degree oven for about 15 to 20 minutes - until heated through. This allows for them to be heated without disturbing them in the process affording them less of a chance to fall apart.",
