Instead of using a can of diced tomatoes, I used a 6 oz can of tomato paste and added 12 oz of water to the recipe. My reason for the substitution of tomato paste is that I don't like diced tomatoes in my chili.  I added the water because I needed more liquid.  It all turned out AWESOME!!! I slow cooked it in a crockpot for about 5 hours.",

I like a little spicy, but not burn the lips off your face, lol, so I had to alter the recipe a bit, this would have been way too hot for me. Like another reviewer, I used two 15 oz cans diced tomatoes and two 15 oz (not 8) cans tomato sauce. I used chopped green pepper instead of hot peppers, and only one tsp red cayenne pepper, and it was plenty spicy for me. I also used 3 fresh minced garlic cloves and dumped in some cumin and crushed oregano. I also put in a stalk and a half of chopped celery and a can of mushrooms, to \"beef\" up the consistency, I didn't even miss the beans! Lastly, I was starving, so I cooked it in my electric pressure cooker for 45 min. So grateful for this recipe, my diet has been a little boring of late and this was very satisfying!",

It's been cooking for about 3 hours and I just took a taste.  It is unbelievably hot, actually to the point of being inedible.  I know the title says spicy and don't get me wrong, I love spicy but this is beyond spicy.  I will absolutely be keeping this as my base chili recipe but will cut the chili powder and cayenne and jalapeno quantities in half.  I also think I will use 1 pound of ground beef and 1 pound of sausage.  I know this review sounds negative but I gave it 5 stars for a reason.  My house smells INCREDIBLE, the flavors are there and this is a delicious recipe, just too hot for my personal taste.",
