I always use my pressure cooker for cooking the chicken when making enchiladas, so much easier and chicken turns out so moist and easily shreds. I put some of the cumin in with the chicken and used a bit less in the mixture. I did top with black olives, more green onions and cilantro. These were full of flavor and my husband said to make these again.",

I only used 8 oz. of Cream Cheese (all I had) and then added 1/2 cup of Non Fat Greek Yogurt. I forgot the Cilantro and green onions. Didn't miss either. I used most of a Costco Chicken that I had pulled the white meat off the bird and shredded. I used Costco Shredded Jack and Cheddar Cheese (all I had)! I made the filling mixture earlier in the day and refrigerated it until I was ready to assemble. It let the flavors come together. You could absolutely make the whole thing in advance drop to room temperature and then bake for dinner! I'm really happy with the way it came out. DH ate two huge plates. I served it with Mexican Rice and a Fresh Corn Red Onion and Tomato Salad with Goat Cheese and Garlic. Tons for left overs. This was really good. Thank you for a recipe that was totally different from what I usually make!",

I was craving some Mexican and this hit the spot. I followed other reviews and only used 1 package of cream cheese, which was plenty. I also boiled my chicken with a bouillon cube and some cumin. I had a bell pepper so I diced that up with a small sweet onion and cooked those down and added it to the chicken mixture. It really added to the flavor and I would recommend doing that if you're interested. Lastly I used a lot more cilantro just because why not? I didn't have any chiles or canned diced tomatoes so I just added salsa to keep it mild. It was delicious and we gobbled these up with sour cream, Mexican rice, and refried beans. My husband said these were better than the restaurant we usually go to and I have to agree. This makes 10 good sized enchiladas so we had leftovers for the next day, which were even better! Even my toddler liked them! Thanks for the great recipe!",
