I doubled the recipe so I could freeze some for busy mornings added more baking powder for a fluffier pancake doubled the spices and added nutmeg and allspice and I cut the water down to two cups as a lot of people mentioned that the batter was way too wet. My pancakes were pretty thick and fluffy but they were a pain to cook. The spices I doubled and added were perfect it's just that maybe cutting back the liquid to two cups was too much? Next time I'll cut it back only a half cup and I think it might be perfect. It really does need the extra baking powder for a fluffier pancake. That being said tasty pancake. Even with my flub-up's this recipe made 15 large pancakes when doubled. Out of the 15 I had three leftover. My boys loved them. I had a small bite of one and thought it was mighty tasty. My son actually remarked that \"these are the best pancakes EVER Mom\".",

Delicious! If you have pancake mix save yourself the trouble of mixing the dry ingredients and just use that instead. Doing it this way will also fix the problems that some reviewers were having with the pancakes not being fluffy or thick enough... If it's too thin just add a little more pancake mix - too thick? Add a little more water. Enjoy!",
