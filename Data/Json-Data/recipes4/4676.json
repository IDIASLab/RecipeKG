I halved the pesto because the pesto at my store comes in 7oz containers and most people said they halved it anyway. I also used diced tomatoes but that's only because I grabbed the wrong can and didn't notice until I had already poured it in the bowl. I don't know what it tastes like with all 15oz of pesto and crushed tomatoes but it was just fine with only 7oz of pesto and diced tomatoes. Also this dish was very big. I had to pour it into a 9x13 casserole dish AND an 8x10 casserole dish. I had a party with 10 people and the 8x10 went untouched and there was about 1 serving left in the 9x13. If you're making this for a family of 4 or 5 you will definitely want to halve the recipe. I didn't give it five stars because it didn't \"Wow Me!\". It was very good and I'll definitely make it again!",

The first time I made it, I subbed tomato paste\nfor crushed tomatoes as had an open can in the fridge--family loved it!  Second time, used diced tomatoes and different cheese--another hit!  Tonight, I actually used crushed tomatoes, but for the cheese I used a combo of mozarella, provolone, guida and parmesan, and added a little more spinach--family again fell all over themselves getting seconds!  The only thing I've done consistently is halve the recipe, because it does make alot!  And, I make my own pesto in the summer and freeze it in golf-ball size servings-and one of them seems to be just perfect.  My family thanks you for posting such a great, pantry-adaptable recipe!!!",

I did it all in one pan on the stove top with the exception of the bread crumb mixture, obviously. Poured it in the 9x13 pan, topped with the crumb mixture & popped it in the oven. It smells divine, too. Can't wait to get my eat on. This is not at all healthy - but outstanding. Thank you so much.",

                "reviewBody": "The combination of ingredients created some degree of palate confusion. I decreased the amount of pesto to 9oz and it was still too much. The finished product was a nondistinct presentation looking more like 'mush' with no appeal. I will not make this again. IF I needed to alter the recipe I would make penne with pesto add some chicken add some sun dried tomatoes and decrease the 4 cups of shredded cheese. One star was way to generous.",
