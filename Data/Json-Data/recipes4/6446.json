And I make with sauteed veggies as well as a variety of meats. Excellent way to use leftovers and clean out the fridge! Get creative and try with anything you normally like on pizza. Here is my preferred process: toast muffin or bagel lightly so they do not become soggy. Top with sauce and place in toaster oven or regular oven if making for a crowd. Let sauce get slightly bubbly. Now top with your favorite toppings. Place back for a couple minutes. Now top with cheese. This is the \"glue\" that holds everything together. Suggested favorites are: mozzarella monterey jack parmesan goat brie. Pop back in till the cheese is as warm and bubbly as you desire! Give it a minute or two as they are hot hot hot! And you don't want to burn your mouth. Get creative and enjoy! Great for kids and as a hot passed appetizer. Have also made on the gas grill and campfire too.",
