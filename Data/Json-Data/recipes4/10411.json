Chinese people use the little cup that comes with a rice cooker to measure rice, roughly pronounced as \"muk\" and is maybe half (or even less) than a standard measurement cup. Congee is generally made with a water to rice ratio of around 10:1. possibly greater. This recipe implies 5:1 which is far too little water.  Hope this helps.",

                "reviewBody": "Hi Caroline Really enjoy your reviews. Here is what I found on your question below: \"Hundred Year Egg Also called century egg thousand-year egg and Ming Dynasty egg these are (usually) chicken eggs preserved by being covered with lime ashes and salt before being shallowly buried for 100 days. The lime \"petrifies\" the egg and makes it appear that it has been buried for at least a century. After the black outer coating and shell are removed a firm amber-colored white and creamy dark green yolk are revealed. They will keep at room temperature for up to 2 weeks or up to a month in the fridge. Hundred Year Eggs are usually eaten uncooked as an appetizer often with accompaniments such as soy sauce or minced ginger. The flavour is pungent and cheeselike.\" This isn't my taste and would probably just use 2 hard cooked chicken eggs if I was making this recipe.",

I use my crock pot and usually have to add another cup and a half of water. Sometimes I add meat of some sort sometimes peeled ginger and lemon grass sometimes oyster sauce sometimes I use chicken broth... We eat it plain sometimes and other times garnish it with hard boiled egg green onions cilantro lime juice etc. Not sure how authentic it is when I make it but we like it a lot and it is cheap if you use broth instead of meat.",
