The chicken was bland and the lemon/orange/wine mixture left an acidic flavor. I would suggest saut\u00e9ing some onions garlic and the lemon/oranges in the olive oil prior to adding the chicken. Then I would substitute honey (& add more than a teaspoon) sweetness to balance out all of the acid. Even adding ginger would give this more flavor. I will not be making this again.",
