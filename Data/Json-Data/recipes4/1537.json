I sprayed Butter Flavored Pam into small glass ramekins,  placed 2 slices of precooked \u201cready\u201d bacon into each cup.  I dropped the egg in and MICROWAVED, on high, for 30 seconds.  I then broke a slice of processed American cheese (use your favorite cheese) into quarters and placed two quarters on top of each egg and microwaved for five more seconds.  Served on a warm buttered English muffin \u2013 YUMM!.  Easy, quick, delicious.  (Remember, ovens vary; make a test run first and adjust time to get the yolk consistency you like.)

I will say that I deviate by wrapping the raw bacon in the tins, and baking them for 5 min in the preheated oven, then dropping the egg in, making sure to center the yolk. One pan, no splatter, no precooked bought bacon (which is also tasty, but the real thing is better), and no pregreasing the tins. All in all wonderful idea. I bake my eggs for 12 min. then leave them in the hot oven switched off while I make toast and prepare my coffee/tea mugs and when I pop them out they are PERFECT. If I'm including cheese, I put it on in the 9 min. mark, then follow as usual.",

I also cooked mine in a water bath (placed the muffin pan in a larger pan with some water in the bottom) I also cheated and used pre-cooked bacon, making the cleanup a snap. Served over toasted whole grain english muffins. The possiblities are endless with this.. do these with canadian bacon and hollaidaise sauce for easy eggs benedict.. or serve over sauteed spinach.  Put sauteed green pepper and onion in the cups prior to breaking the eggs in.  I can't wait to experiment with these. ",

So cute when you pop it out of the ramekin!  I don't know that I would ever cook these on the stove again because this was such a simple method (I was able to walk away and get other stuff done) and I like the presentation/neatness.",

I baked these at the same time as a batch of biscuits, and made Hollandaise sauce while they were cooking. Split the biscuits, topped each half with an egg and covered with Hollandaise sauce for a different kind of Eggs Benedict. I like another reviewer's idea of serving these over sauteed spinach and will have to try that! If you want to save time when you make this recipe next, cook extra bacon and form it into rounds in the muffin tin until they cool and hold their shape, then put the \"bacon rounds\" in a baggy in the freezer. Next time all you'll have to do is grease the muffin tin, pop in the bacon rounds and crack an egg, then into the oven.",

A rather bland dish, it's badly in need of some doctoring up; maybe scramble the egg a bit first so you don't have that hard-cooked yolk lump in the middle, add some green onion and black pepper to jazz things up.  A dollop of salsa or sour cream after cooking would not be amiss either.  My husband and I ended up peeling the bacon off, eating that & giving the rest to the dogs.
