I have tried this recipes with flax sesame and sunflower seeds (in various combinations) and it has turned out well every time. Much like other reviewers I add honey (about 1/8 cup) and 1 tsp of xantan gum when I have it. Another to die for combination my family enjoys is cinnamon raisin. 3/4 cups raisins (soaked in water for 15 minutes and drained) and cinnamon to taste (approx 2tsp for me)... when toasted with butter is fantastic!",

Now...not being totally equiped with all ingredients I used alot of substitutes. ie: had no sesame seeds so I used half poppy seeds and half crushed blanched almonds; had no molasses so used part brown sugar and part maple syrup to make up the tbsp; had no cows milk so used a rice milk. Oh and I added a touch more b/soda. All I can say is this was one fantastic loaf of bread! It rose up beautifully and was soooo yummy. So I guess I played around with this recipe due to lack of exact ingredients but must say I had alot of fun making the bread. Thanks so much Jean for sharing this great bread recipe! YYYYUM!",

It was a heck of a lot faster and easier too. I used regular spelt and whole spelt and was generous with the honey (instead of molasses). Next time I will either add even more honey or use 3 parts regular to 1 part whole since this loaf tasted so nutty it was almost woodsy. But this is the recipe I plan to use as a base in the future.",

I substituted a mix of quinoa flax and sunflower seeds for the sesame seed and 1/4 cup of honey instead of the molasses. I also used whole spelt flour since I have to grind my grains just before I use it. Very nutty! To remedy the fall apart nature of spelt bread I always add about 1 tsp. xanthan gum or guar gum powder during the mixing. Delicious recipe and no yeast!!!!",
