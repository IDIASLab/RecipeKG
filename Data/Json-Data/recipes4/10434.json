Make sure your ice is mashed/crushed well b/c the first couple snow cones we made it all sunk to the bottom like a glass of kool-ade BUT the rest turned out fine. Not \"exactly\" like county fair snow cones b/c those seem more syrupy while this was a little watery but close enough and they're fun to make! Thanks Connie!",
