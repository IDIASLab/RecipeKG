I thought about tossing the sprouts when I got my weekly delivery of organic veggies and saw those in there. but not wanting to be wasteful I figured I would try to find a good recipe to use them in. This was a perfect recipe! I added some cooked quartered red potatoes with the sprouts during the last 10 minutes of cooking and it was so good. Be sure to use good quality balsamic. I used an 18 year aged BV that was slightly flavored with cassis which worked well.",

I've made this version a few times, and it is really good, however I think you can definitely cut back on the calories and fat. Instead of using 1/2 pound of bacon (wayyyy too much if you ask me! Why not just have bacon for dinner?) I only use about 3 slices. This will give you about 2 tbs of fat to work with, and you won't have to drain any of it. I also use center cut bacon which has less fat and more flavor.  I eliminate the butter altogether, I find it really unnecessary considering all of the other liquids that you add in later, and there is enough bacon fat to coat and cook the onion and garlic. I also add a whole small onion, and more garlic to enhance the flavor. Using chicken broth also works (I sometimes don't have chicken stock), but use the stock if you have it as I think it's a little more flavorful that way. Overall, a really good recipe--one that even my mother asked me for! Which is saying a lot.",
