Be creative and make it with your fave spices and flavours! I only added cajun seasoning and lots of garlic powder and it was fantastic - crispy and tender! My fiance loved it too!!!

I spent a good 20 minutes reading reviews before I even pulled any ingredients out.

I spread on a THIN layer of mayo on chicken and rolled it in italian seasoned breadcrumbs before spraying olive oil on top and cooking on foil lined cookie sheet.  I cooked for 15 minutes before turning each breast over and cooking for 15 more minutes.  Result: crunchy almost fried-chicken like top layer and juicy inside with a nice kick.",

I use garlic and onion powder sometimes but mostly cajun seasoning.  Use your judgement on what you like and how much - Sky's the limit, add what you like, even a bit of lemon!  (which I never do, hate lemon chicken :)) - once the spices/herbs are mixed in and the chicken pieces laying flat in a baking pan  - I use a silicon basting brush and paint my chicken with the mayon on one side - this helps keep the mayo even and not too thick. I sprinkle toss my bread crumbs over the chicken, turn the chicken and repeat the process - its quick and keeps the mess down too.  The breadcrumbs.. this works with anything, my guy loves it with panko and chinese 5 spice.  My daughters fav is crushed garlic and herb croutons and cornflakes.  Again, Sky's the limit here.    and if you use low fat mayo, skinless chicken. the calories saved are amazing!This is an EXCELLENT RECIPE and I can't recommend it enough",
