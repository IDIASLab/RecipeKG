LOL. i had two cups of mashed taters, so i used them up. i did however forget to add the dill.  i have no explanation, so i look at it this way...another layer of flavour to look forward to the next time.  there will absolutely be a next time. oh, i opted not to fry and baked them at 375 deg for 45 min. turning them halfway. nice and crisp on the outside. YUM!  thanks for sharing with us Avon :) okay....update. i was very fortunate to have one leftover. i had it for breakfast the next morning with a fried over easy egg draped over top.  it was amazing. you have no idea. you must try this!!!!!",

I used my Pampered Chef food chopper to finely chop the ham.   I put the patties together in the morning, then refrigerated them until dinner time.  It made cooking dinner so easy.  I only had to fry them about 3 minutes on each side and they were done.  I served \"Mustard Mayonnaise Sauce\" from this site to accompany them along with a side of asparagus.  This is a real winner and will be served many times over at our house.  I just love having something new to make out of left-over ham.   The crunch is my favorite part, be sure to use \"panko\" crumbs.  Thank you Avon for sharing this SUPER YUMMY recipe---you rock!!",

I ll go buy a small ham steak just to make these again. DW who follows her Weight Watchers to a tee threw caution to the wind and ate three of these. Now my only problem is which folder I will file it under in my recipe box. These Cake-ettes could be a main a side or made smaller for appetizers and can be served at breakfast lunch or dinner. If anyone is skeptical about the dill weed fear not it adds a depth of flavor without calling attention to itself. Thanks Avon.",
