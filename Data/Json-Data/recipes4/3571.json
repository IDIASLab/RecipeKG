I then scooped the chicken into a lightly greased muffin tin, covering with guac mix + cheese and broiled for 3 min.  I haven't tried yet, but suspect this will also make amazing chicken nachos.   Overall this significantly reduces calories by removing butter + olive oil (340 cal) and increasing the portion yield to 6.  Enjoy!",
