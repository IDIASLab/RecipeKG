Also, we had sugar snap peas on hand so used them instead of snow peas. I followed others recommendations and marinaded and baked the tofu. I also added fresh mushrooms that were marinaded in the same sauce (Gyoza Sauce from Trader Joe\u2019s) since I had them and needed to use them. When I make this again I think fresh ginger would enhance the dressing.",
