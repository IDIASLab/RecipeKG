It was pretty good though I made quite a few changes using 3/4 lb pork sausage no pepper/mushroom/garlic 4 eggs and closer to 1/2 cup milk an entire batch of Betty Crocker 3-cheese biscuit mix that I had already stirred up before I saw this recipe and mozz. and sharp cheddar both stirred into the egg mixture. I baked at 400 for half an hour then covered with foil and baked for an additional 15 min at 375. I will make again though with more sharp cheddar because it needs more edge.",

I didn't have spicy sausage so used the bulk maple turkey sausage (from the Rootcellar)and didn't have mushrooms. I used a yellow pepper as I didn't have a green one. Added some spinach on the top before adding the cheese. Made my own biscuit mix from a recipe from this site and used Monterey Jack cheese.
