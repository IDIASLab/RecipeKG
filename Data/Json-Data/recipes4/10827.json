I took the advice of another reviewer and let it rise with a steaming pot in the oven-- worked great! We ate this with \"Super Sloppy Joes\" (search for it) in the middle with cheddar cheese on top. Deliciously filling. One thing to remember though-- making six bowls means they need a little extra time in the oven, maybe 5 minutes or they are a tad doughy.",

I cut back on the salt to 1-1/2 tsp., next time I will add the whole amount.  As per others' recommendations, I used olive oil and added a Tbsp. of sugar.  I made 6 bowls, which were a good size, but very filling.  (A secret I learned from Alton Brown from the Food Channel - place the dough in an oiled bowl or tall container.  Cover with a cloth.  Boil water and pour into a bowl.  Place both in the oven.  The steam creates the perfect temperature for rising the dough.   Works great every time!)",

Bread bowls are just big ole round loaves of bread that you scoop out to make a bowl you can eat & dip with as you eat the stew or soup in it.  Anyway, to each his own, but I wanted to say that bit in case anyone thinks they can't just accomplish a good ole bread bowl by plopping four round blobs of dough in the oven.  Worked great for us, & my husband raved more over this meal than he has over most any other one!  I made the Beef Stew VI from this site to eat in the bowls.",

                "reviewBody": "These bread bowls worked out great for our broccoli and cheese soup. I had them rise and bake in small oven safe stoneware bowls which worked out perfectly for individual servings. For those of you who are having problems with your bread rising you may want to try a few things first.  #1 Make sure you have a good active yeast, not an old one. (Note; 2 1/4 tsp of yeast = 1 yeast packet.)  #2 You may want to add a tsp or Tbs (depending on preference)of sugar to the yeast/water mix to help activate the yeast faster. You shouldn't notice much of a taste difference with only a tsp.  #3 If your dough is remaining flat, try the stoneware,oven safe bowl or foil method. It helps shape the loaf up for more filling space, rather than out.  #4 If you are personally finding the bread on the bland side, try adding some of your favorite herbs and spices to the flour mixture. Try 1 Tbs of Italian seasoning for a more robust bread. Maybe add some grated cheese to the dough. If you are having a clam chowder, try adding a Tbs of dill to perk up the flavor. Sprinkle a bit of garlic salt or powder on the tops of the loaves after the egg wash for a bit of a zing. The wonderful thing about bread dough is it can be so versitile to suit your own personal tastes. Jump in and experiment. Just remember, a little bit goes a long way when it comes to herbs and spices.  I just wanted to state that I am not adding these tips to take away from the original recipe.",

DO NOT reknead the bowls- avoid handling them directly before baking so they will stay raised.  Delish! Thanks Kerri!",

After reading the reviews on about the \"flatness\" of the bowls, I shaped them into 4 round rolls instead.  They rose perfectly and flattened out a little bit.  I skipped the first egg wash and they came out gorgeous!  Beautiful golden, shiny on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.  Served them with chicken stew/chicken pot pie filling.",

My \"bread bowls\" turned out to be hard very dense...rolls. They didn't rise one bit and I followed the directions as written (except for letting them sit for much longer hoping they would start to rise). I baked until the outside was golden brown but the inside didn't seem fully cooked--and very tough and doughy. I'm pretty sure my error came in with the mixing and/or kneading of the dough because it was very dense from the beginning as I was adding the flour by 1/2 cup to the bowl. Maybe I added too much flour and/or overmixed. And I just read another review that said I shouldn't use a hand mixer? News to me I thought that's what the recipe was talking about. I used mine along with the dough hooks that came with it. So I\"ll try this again...someday...once I get my morale back.:) This was a little time consuming.",
