However, I dressed this recipe up tonight for my company's pot-luck Christmas party. I drained off most of the water and added 1/3 of an 8 oz block of cream cheese, diced, and about 1/2 cup of sour cream, with about 1/2 a cup of milk, or less (I confess to not measuring).  I mashed these with my electric mixer, then stirred in 1/2 cup of shredded colby/jack cheese. I covered the dish with another half a cup of cheese. At the party, my pot was scraped clean, and I even caught someone licking the spoon!",

When the potatoes were done cooking I removed the rosemary sprigs & mashed them with butter & whole milk. They were hands down the BEST mashed potatoes ever....Everyone agreed.",

I was happy to find this recipe being they are made in the crock pot to save me time. I changed the recipe to 15 servings because I used 5 pounds of potatoes and they were edible not terribly bad but not a favorite. To many of us they tasted like roasted potatoes that were later mashed. They do save time and are passible but I'm sure glad I had another pan to serve.
