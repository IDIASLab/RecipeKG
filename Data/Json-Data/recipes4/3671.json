I thought I had lemongrass and red chile pepper at home but I did not but I did have a red curry paste which I added with the cocunut milk and it added just the right touch of flavor. I also used Pillsbury cresent rolls for the pastry and they turned out a lot larger than the small pouches intended for this recipe. The curry part was also great curry recipe on its own. The only change I would I would have made for a curry is addding a whole can of coconut milk for a more liquid curry over rice. But it makes sense to have a dryer consistency if you're going to wrap it in a pastry and bake it.",

If you are doing a long roll fold over one edge onto the filling apply a bit of water and fold the other edge over the dampened edge. Then pierce gently diagonally with fork tines to seal. After baking immediately cut long roll into serving sizes. However leaving one end slightly open will help the built-up steam escape out of the puff.",

The puff pastry isn't the easiest thing to work with- before cooking they looked beautiful then as soon as they started cooking they opened up. I found that when they were cooling I was able to push the folds back down no problem. The trick with puffed pastry is keeping it cold while you're working with it (and water patches up holes). Thank you! Will be making this again! Does take some time but worth it (especially if you're only in charge of appetizers!)",

Night one I made the curry (easy) and filled the puff pastries up with them. Don't forget to make sure the pastry is thawed when working with it. I refrigerated over night. Night two after coming home from work I just threw them in the oven. It made about 18. The key is to serve at room temp. as the recipe states. I kept tasting fresh out the oven and they were not amazing. But after cooling they were great! I recommend plenty of salt it was missing a little something for me because I love strong flavored curries - I would probably add curry paste too next time. Definitely 5 stars based on the reaction I got. Another added bonus - without the chicken these are great VEGAN snacks!",
