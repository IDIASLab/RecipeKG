Read all reviews before starting, so I food processed yellow banana peppers and red onion in with the cauli. We only had one head of cauliflower, so I cut recipe in half. Next time I'll get another head of cauliflower! As we don't keep Italian dressing in the house I just added a mix of what might be equivalent: marjoram, sweet basil, kelp, freshly squeezed garlic, chives, parsley, tarragon, thyme, celery salt . . . but it still was lacking punch, so I added quite a bit of salt and then some paprika. Once it fried in the olive oil (with a wee bit of butter cut in), it was amazing! Thank you for this. I can see adding leftover mashed potatoes to the mix, kale, or artichoke hearts next time. It's a very flexible recipe--heat it up, mellow it out--all in your personal taste & preferences. Will stick this one in the recipe box to use again & again. And, no leftovers at all--phenomenal with a little aioli garlic mustard sauce on top, too! mmMMMmmm.",

I ended up adding  garlic, parmesan romano cheese and chives, because that's what the other recipe called for.  To turn them into fritters at this point I added 1/2 Italian bread crumbs, baking powder and eggs.  They turned out delicious.",

Plan to freeze some and reheat in the toaster over. I used a 12 inch skillet and placed 1 tablespoon oil spread with a brush for each batch. I made bigger fritters using 1/3 to 1/2 cup batter for each and then pressed down with back of spatula to flatten them. Each side took 2-3 minutes to get golden brown. Didn't have the Italian Dressing Mix (IDM) so I made a recipe by the same name on this site and greatly reduced the salt to 1 teaspoons in the IDM. I used 2 tablespoons of the mix in the fritters. Perfect. These are healthy, tasty little gems. So good, I'll bring them to the next pot luck with the gals and see if they can detect what's in these fritters. The addition of parmesan cheese or percorino romano might take these over the top over the top again. Thought they may need a green onion dip or topping to really hit the spot but they didn't need anything. Thanks so much Bettycook for a great recipe.",
