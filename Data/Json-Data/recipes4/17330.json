This is really good but if you don't have all of these different beans on hand you could just buy one of those 16 ounces packages of mixed beans. I want to say they call it 15 bean soup? Anyway, use whatever dry beans you like or whichever ones you have on hand. I made as written but any dry beans would work nicely as long as you use 16 ounces. Note I also used Rotel with diced green chilies for my tomatoes and I did  not drain them.",
