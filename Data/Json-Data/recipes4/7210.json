The dish was easy to make, and although the spices and ingredients don't sound like they'd go together -- they do! The sauce was thick, rich and creamy, the chicken tender and juicy. I took the breasts out to shred, gave the sauce a good stir, and then placed the shredded chicken back into the crockpot on low while I made the pasta and side dish (green beans with grape tomatoes in a touch of Italian dressing). Thank goodness -- a new staple that every one can agree on! Thanks!",

(I could literally drink it!!) I did however; leave out the malt vinegar (simply because I had none on hand) and that might have ACTUALLY worked in my benefit.

I made a casserole with it using egg noodles. 2 hours on \"high\" and 2 hours on \"low\" was perfect. Wife said a bit salty but delicious (she has her own salt-lick) so it was a bit much for me (but still edible) and still good. Also used 2 cans mushroom soup.  Next time will use thighs again and use 2 cans of low sodium soup.  Will also delete the tsp salt as I believe there is enough in the salad dressing (salt is one thing that you can always add on your plate for those with salt-lick fetishes).  This is a keeper as noted and hope you may find this helpful.",

It was tamed down by the sauce and the pasta so it wasn't overwhelming (this is coming from someone with a low tolerance to spicy foods!). Very very yummy!",
