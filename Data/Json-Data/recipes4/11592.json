I replaced one can of cream of chicken with a can of cream of cheese for extra creamy cheeziness. Laziness enticed me to use a pack of insta-chicken in those no-drain pouches (like the newfangled tuna.) My only complaint was the salt content which could easily be avoided by using low-sodium soup. My other half loved it and he's notoriously picky. This meal took about two minutes to mix and probably five to simmer. A great choice for my first allrecipes.com dinner!",

I baked 1 pound of fresh boneless chicken breasts instead of using a chicken in a can and used Campbell's Special Request 98% Fat Free Cream of Chicken Soup to help reduce the fat content. I also had to add tiny bit more water to get the stuffing to soften properly. It turned out great - I will definitely make it again.",
