To make it taste better try this; Add 1 tsp garlic 1 tsp ginger 1 onion 1 red chilli 1 red capsicum. To make it easier try this; Chop all veges and chicken. Cook chicken and onion (and salt & pepper)until not pink any more. Remove chicken from pan. I n same pan stirfry all veges and flavourings until crisp/cooked. Re-add chicken to pan warm. Pour in peaches & syrup and cook until thickened (only a few minutes). Eat with rice. Tastes great and much easier.",

I used a tbs of cinnamon; wich did add a bit of flavor. Also I used 2 cans of peaches it made more sauce for the rice. I also left about a quarter cup of the starchy rice water and mixed it into the chicken sauce a bit. This will be a dish we eat when I've run out of everything else. We usually have broccoli peaches and chicken stocked.",
