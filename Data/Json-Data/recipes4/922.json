We had a pound of Italian sausage (I guess you'd call it \"sweet\") so we browned (in cast iron skillet) and drained it well. Then we added 2 T olive oil before adding the onions and 8 cloves garlic. When all this was browned we added the Merlot wine to help loosen all the good stuff carmelized in the pan then combined everything in a separate pot to simmer. We don't like the flavor of higher acid foods like tomatoes when cooked in cast iron.",

Could also try adding some different spices or fresh veggies perhaps some fresh tomatoes along with the crushed ones from a can. I guess I just like more complicated tomato sauces!

If you use Del Monte whole tomatoes and then use another brand later you get a different sauce. And the suasage....wow talk about variation. Half the fun of cooking a great meal is searching your area for the best sausage that YOU like. Ask around ask grandma which butcher knows how to make sausage which brand she likes. Isernios out of the package is pretty lean as sausage goes. The stuff you buy in the meat counter as the grocery store is silly. Look for a independent meat market where the butcher make his own. Or better yet get some nice lean Pork Butt grind it up and get a good recipe here on the web....its silly simple. You don't need perfectly good pork wrapped in a casing to call it sausage. Where did that casing come from? Is it natural? It is adding to the flavor of the sauce? And the wine. Do some homework and try several kinds of wine. Find one that suits you you're eating it. Lastly when making your sauces and trying them out be sure to write down the little things that make one sauce different from the other. Make sure the recipe as the brand of ingredient time of year purchased or whatever you will need to make that sauce for company. If you don't take notes you will not likely get the same exact ingredients next time and when company comes and you are expecting a certain taste....well you get the point.",
