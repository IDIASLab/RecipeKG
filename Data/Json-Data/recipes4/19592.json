I have made many of this recipe submitters recipes and they have all turned out perfect as written so I'm wondering if there wasn't a typo in the editing somewhere? That or maybe I misunderstood something and did it wrong. If you are reading this Fioa you might want to check. I am still giving this 4 stars because the flavor is excellent it was super easy and the chicken was fall apart tender. This soup loving gal might have to make some soup with the \"broth\". It was that good!",
