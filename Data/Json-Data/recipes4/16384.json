Then I added a touch of salt and pepper a can of tuna (yes I said tuna fish--from Costco) and just a very small amount of mayo. It was wonderful! So I made your side dish into a main dish that way and I've already been told to make it again that very same way. Who knew?! I loved the smell of the rice cooking because it took me way back in all those years when we first started using Rice A Roni! Thanks so much!",
