I had tons of fresh basil, a half a pint of grape tomatoes, and 5 pounds of mozzarella on hand left over from a charity event we made baked ziti for.  Since I only had half the amount of tomatoes called for, I added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce I found in the pantry, and loaded the sauce up with fresh basil instead of just adding it at the end.  I used two cups of mozzarella in place of the pepper jack and served this over ravioli instead of penne.  Usually I stick to a recipe the first time I make it but I wanted a quick dinner using ingredients I already had, so I changed this a little bit and it came out great.  Definitely try this recipe, and don't be afraid of doing a little experimentation.  I will be certainly be making this again.  Next time I'm going to try the recipe exactly as written, but I'm sure it's great either way!",

It's like a new versions of mac and cheese. You won't be diappointed if you give this recipe a shot.",

Melting the cheese as directed makes the cheese clumpy when trying to mix the penne in. I had to break up chunks of cheese that melted to try to distribute it throughout the dish. Next time I would advise to put the cheese into the hot penne instead of putting the penne into a pan of melted cheese. After tasting it was lacking some flavor so we decided to add some homemade pesto to the recipe.",

I used much less cheese than the recipe called for - about 1/2 a cup of mozz a small amount of parm and added feta instead of the jack. It came out great. Next time I will add spinach for sure. I served it with the Parmesan Chicken recipe by Mollie Hall on this site (see my review there for my adjustments). FANTASTIC dinner - everyone in the family had seconds!",
