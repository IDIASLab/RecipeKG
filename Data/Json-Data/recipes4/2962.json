So I picked up a brisket at the store not knowing what kind of meat to buy. I went home and started marinating it. Then I called my mom and she said \"No no... you don't marinate a brisket. Take it out of your marinade and throw it in a crock pot.\" But I was determined. So I searched for \"marinated brisket\" and this was the only recipe that came up. It's a good thing it did... because it saved my brisket. And it came out beautifully. Tender juicy and delicious. If I can make this one anyone can. Totally easy and totally good. Thank you!",

The marinade was similar to this recipe but I have added ketchup and steak sauce after reading this. After letting the brisket marinade overnight I seared it on the grill. While it was searing I cut up potatoes into large chunks and put them at the bottom of a large pot. I then placed the seared brisket on top of this. I poured in the marinade on top of the brisket and then added beef broth till it covered the potatoes. I allowed it to cook until tender; about 5 hours. I think it would have been even better if I had let it cook a couple more hours but we were hungry. I thought that the potatoes were not going to be very good this way but my husband thought they were good when he stole a bite out of the pot.",

The steak sauce I chose probably contributed to that therefore I don't recommend using Vidalia Onion Steak Sauce. I also thought it needed more salt which surpised me because the recipe calls for 1 Tbsp. The brisket was nice and tender. Also I loved being able to fix it early to cook all day. It smelled wonderful. After one bite my family smothered it all in BBQ sauce so next time I might use that in the marinade instead of steak sauce.",
