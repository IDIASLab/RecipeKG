The ham I had was pre sliced so I just chopped it up, next time I want to use cubed ham.  I used a bag of frozen chopped potatoes (cheesy bacon flavor), and they kind of mashed themselves in the slow cooker.  If you don't want the potatoes to be creamy then cook them separately then add to the ham mixture at the end.  This would be a great side dish for Thanksgiving too.",

I ended up having to use raw potatoes cubed fresh green pepper and onion and pre-sliced ham steaks which I cut into pieces. The potatoes held their form so it didn't turn out like mashed potatoes but more like potato soup-ish. I thought it turned out pretty good. My companion said different ham next time which would have been more appropriate to the recipe. Super easy and super good!",
