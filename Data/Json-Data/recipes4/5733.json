The amounts are right on and I didn't have to add any extra liquids or dry ingredients. My family wasn't thrilled with the glaze but we just scraped that part off. This makes awesome meatloaf sandwiches:) And it tastes so very much better the next day. Not that it isn't good at first just better after it sits overnight. Thanks for the recipe:)",
