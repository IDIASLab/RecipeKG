I do roll out between two sheets of waxed paper (lightly sprinkle water on cutting board before putting down the first sheet of paper to keep it from moving while you're rolling) and then just peel off the top sheet and lift the bottom sheet with crust on it & invert to place over pie plate... then carefully peel off that sheet as you fit it to plate..

I used regular flour... Some tips for extra flakiness and easy work with it: it MUST rest in the fridge the time depends on the thickness of your disc of dough just check the dough is completly cold and firm. Flour generously the surface before rolling take the dough for 5 to 10 mins out of the refrigerator make a disk of 1/2 inch thick and fold it like a napkin in four then just roll the dough the sice and thickness you need for your recipe. If you are making a pie or quiche that needs less than 40 or 45 mins in the oven I would recomend to cook the pastry a little before without the filling just cover the pan put foil and some dry beans to make weight cook for 20 mins remove the foil and the beans (be careful it will be extra hot). Let the pie shell cool down while making the filling then fill it cook as directed and that's it. If using a glass pan you can check the golden colour of the bottom. You can also make delicius chocolate pastries with this dough...",
