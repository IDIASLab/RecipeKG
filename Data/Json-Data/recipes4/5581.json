Next time I think I would use all sweets and maybe add one more onion but that's honestly a personal preferance not a reflection of the recipe. I'd make this again.",

I only used sweet onion and more than called for. The flavor was nice! This won't replace my usual onion soup recipe but for quickness and ease this was great! I may even try to use this method w/ my usual recipe b/c the concept is just great. I made my own 'croutons' using sliced baguette that I toasted on each side and then rubbed w/ a clove of fresh garlic and I used swiss just b/c that's what I always use when I make onion soup. All in all this was good and I would def make it again with a few minor adjustments! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I added 1/2 a tsp & it still needs more. I skipped the brandy & did 3 tbs of beef stock & it worked out perfect cause that's exactly what I had left of it. My husband wont even let me cook with alcohol pregnant, Ive explained to him it evaporates, still big no. It tastes a lot better with the croutons & cheese, it has a better flavor I think from the seasoning on the croutons. I didnt do the oven safe bowl & all that I just put it in the microwave for 1 serving for myself. Im going to see how this freezes, keeping the croutons & cheese seperate untill re-warming it. Its good, Im eating it as I write this. Definately not the onion soup from Mimi's cafe but still yummy. If I make this again I will use baugette as apposed to crouton & season the soup up a bit with some herbs.",

The liquid reduced quite a bit while cooking. I also did not add salt or pepper. The soup is salty enough on it's own. This was a big hit at my house. I will make this again for sure and often!",
