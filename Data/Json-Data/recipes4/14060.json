I had leftover egg noddles from beef stroganoff the night before (somehow I always make too many noodles). I made a few substitutions for what I had on hand - milk for the white wine cheddar for the swiss and turkey ham for the ham. It came out sooooo good. I loved how the stuffing mix was a salty crunch and the noodles were creamy. If you don't like salt then make sure to use low sodium everything - ham cream of mushroom cheese and stuffing all are typically pretty salty stuff. The only thing I would work on whem making again is that it came out well soupy. Maybe less water or let it bake longer? Despite the sloppy-ness of it I am more than excited to eat it for leftovers today and tomorrow at work!",
