While it cooked I melted 1/4 cup of light butter (it has a large water content anyway so I figured it evened out. I then juiced one lemon added a little cayenne salt pepper and garlic. I let this simmer until the water was gone from the butter. I poured this over the broccoli and sprinkled with about a tablespoon of parmesean cheese. The broccoli has a very light lemon taste and was perfect. I will remember this and make again in the future.",
