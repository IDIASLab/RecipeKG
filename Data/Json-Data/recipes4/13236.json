You can increase the heat to your liking with your favorite hot sauce. Habanero hot sauce works best, as very little is needed to increase the heat without changing the flavor of the marinade. I think mesquite charcoal works best as it enhances the flavor.",

I have searched everywhere for a truly spicy chicken without any sweetness and this is it! I would dare to say it rivals the flavor of the Chipotle Restaurant marinade. I followed the directions using boneless skinless chicken breasts but I think you could leave out the salt entirely (not so great for you) and not miss it. After marinating for 7 hours and grilling for 4 minutes each on the George Foreman this made a very hot dish! Definitely great for the winter time on a cold day. Prepare to guzzle a gallon of water though!",
