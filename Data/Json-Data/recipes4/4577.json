                "reviewBody": "I thought I had grilled everything that could be grilled until I saw this recipe.  Grilled meatloaf?  I made half the recipe for the two of us, but used one whole egg, essentially doubling the amount called for.  It was a good idea because had I not done this it might have been a tad dry. For the same reason, I cut back on the amount of bread crumbs by about one-fourth. I\u2019m not a fan of tarragon, so I didn\u2019t use it.  I used Penzey\u2019s Chicago Seasoning, probably a good teaspoon for a pound and a half of meat, a mix of ground beef, pork and veal.  I found the mix a little dry so I added some of the barbecue sauce/ketchup mixture to the meat mixture \u2013 good call, it was excellent!   I also added finely chopped celery and green pepper and more Worcestershire than directed.  Not wanting the glaze to burn during cooking, I waited until about 20 minutes into the cooking time to spread it on the meatloaves ( I made two small loaves with a half recipe) and then a second time after 15 more minutes.  Slow to start cooking, the loaves came to the 160 degree temperature quickly after that.  An instant-read thermometer was very helpful.  The cooking method was not only intriguing, it also resulted in a perfectly moist and flavorful loaf, although the charcoal flavor was not as apparent as I had thought it would be.  All and all, a great meatloaf I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to make again \u2013 even in the middle of Wisconsin winter!",

Of course I added more fresh garlic I always do. Used a 15 inch aluminum cookie sheet to mold a rectangle meatloaf about an inch and half thickness. Topped with some grated Monterey Jack/Colby cheese then topped with just 15 oz. can of tomato sauce (didn't want to use BBQ since my spices were Italian). Then topped the tomato sauce with sliced green bell peppers and fresh mushroom slices. Cooked on a charcoal covered grill over indirect heat for about 50 minutes turning the cookie sheet half way through to make sure even cooking. The flavor of the charcoal makes a meatloaf to die for. We have actually been grilling meatloaves for a couple years now...hard to go back to regular oven meatloaf once you've had it charcoaled grilled.",
