Mix them up and bake the cake as directed.  Use sugar-free jello and fat-free whipped topping.  Top with fruit.

When I was making the holes for the jell-o I stuck a small fork into each cupcake about four time and wiggled it around before pulling it out so the holes would be big enough. Then I just spooned the jell-o individually on to each cupcake using a regular old tablespoon until all of the jell-o was gone. They turned out great with a dollop of whipped cream and garnished with some silver sprinkles and pomegranate seeds!",
