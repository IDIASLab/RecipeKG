The fish is mouth-watering tender and the sauce very good. I did have to make a few slight adjustments. I am not crazy about blackened seasoning so substitues Tony Cacheres Creole Seasoning. Added some extra mushrooms and some half n half to add some richness and cut back some of the salt. Cream of shrimp can be a little salty and I found that this combination helped eliminate that. Overall a very good dish. Thanks for the recipe.",

If I used Mushroom again I would use 1 can and some Half & Half.  Soup mixture was very thick. I think it depends on which brand you use. The 2nd time I used Cream of Shrimp and BOY was it worth it. It was absolutely amazing. Use the Cream of Shrimp if you can find it. Will be using this recipe for a long time.",

We will definately use again, but will probably try with tilapia.  Thanks for the post.",

In step 3, I added a small can of mushrooms-undrained (instead of fresh), sweet onion instead of green, 1 can cream of celery soup and 1/2 cup sour cream (instead of the crm of shrimp).  And finally, served over fettucine noodles.  Yummo!  We usually pay $20 a plate for this at our local resturant!  Never again!!!",
