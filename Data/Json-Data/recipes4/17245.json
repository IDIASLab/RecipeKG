I followed the recipe exactly, and these are the problems I encountered.  First of all, there was far too much fat.  The fat actually kept the meat from coming in contact with the pan, so it didn't brown quickly.  A quick sear is all that is necessary, with only enough fat to keep the meat from sticking to the skillet.  Secondly, apple quarters did not have enough time in the oven to become tender.  I would recommend cutting the apple into eighths or smaller.  I'm glad there was a brine, for the pork would have been inedible without it.  Nice flavor combination--I love rosemary on most meats, and pork with apples is always a winning combination, in my book.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!",

I'm not sure if they might have been better if I had. They were easy and the apples were tender. I served with Sweet and Sour cabbage and it was a nice side with these chops. I agree with the other review that there was too much fat. I will reduce the butter and oil and try these again brining for the full recommended time. They were more tender than they would have been without the brining. That is my goal since these chops tend to be very dry. I will try them again. Thanks for sharing.",

This is how I modified the recipe: I brined the chops exactly as prescribed, but only used the butter (and about a Tbsp at a time) when browning the chops in the skillet. I probably did 2-3 min on one side and 1 min on the other. I had to break up the browning into two batches since I had about 8 chops. I threw in the apples with the second batch (along with the rosemary)to soften them up a little. Then I transferred everything to a glass baking dish and baked it all for an additional 10 min. Served the apples and pork chops with some steamed broccoli. Delish!",

Apples are yummy.  \nI also deglazed the pan and used the liquid from oven to make a sauce with cornstarch to drizzle over chops.\nThis would be a good company meal! Pair with a potato of choice and veggie.\nPS... I forgot the Rosemary but it was still good! I will not forget it next time as I love the flavor of Rosemary!",
