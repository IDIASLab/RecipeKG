I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and doubled the sauce, added pea pods to the mix, and also scaled the cayenne back a bit for my kids. I will probably use the suggested amount next time - I think it will be zippy without being unbearably spicy.  With those adjustments, I was really enjoying my plate of chicken (on a bed of rice, of course!), but then I went from great to *PERFECT* with the addition of a handful of fresh cilantro leaves.  Could not be better; forty-seven stars!",
