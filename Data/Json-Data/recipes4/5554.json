Because I'm the first person to rate this recipe I had no other reviewers suggestions to go on...so I made it exactly as directed. I usually look over other reviews and decide from the start what I'm going to add or delete to the recipe. Maybe that's not always a good plan as I prepared this one as directed and it was perfect! I enjoyed knowing there were so many fresh veggies in this and because of that it tasted so fresh and healthy. I plan to make this one over and over again and save it to My Recipes. The next time I plan to sprinkle some toasted cashews on top just before serving to take it over the top. Thanks BramptonMommyof2!",

I just added chicken breast to the dish and it was fantastic. I highly recommend this to everyone!",

It cooked down to about 1 cup so perhaps that was what the author intended. It did not taste strongly of \"greens\" so it wasn't too much. The other things I changed was to use cooked brown rice instead of white. And since I had no mushrooms I omitted them. The result was a hearty flavorful side dish that went beautifully with grilled mahi mahi and asparagus for dinner. I served the Sauteed Rice with Kale with a choice of soy sauce or Parmesan Cheese.",
