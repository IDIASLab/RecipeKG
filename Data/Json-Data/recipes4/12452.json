Then proceeded to cook according to the recipe. I did not fry up the tomatoes I just threw them in fresh. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and made a nice lemon butter sauce to pour over the top. It was unbelievably good! I gave this a 5 star rating because you can use fresh canned and probably frozen salmon here as well as canned whole tomatoes in a pinch and it would still taste great!",
