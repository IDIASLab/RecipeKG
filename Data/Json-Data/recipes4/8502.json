In addition to seasoning the zucchini with salt and pepper, I also used garlic powder. I cut the recipe down b/c I only had 2 small to medium sized zucchini, and it fit into a fairly small casserole dish (though I did get 4 layers, which I loved), so I would cook all the zucchini first then determine the size dish to use b/c I personally think that a 13x9 dish would be too big. This made a great side for our pasta tonight, but I could totally eat this as a main dish with a nice salad and some garlic bread on the side. We did not miss the usual breading/frying of regular zucchini parmesan and it wasn't nearly as heavy. This is a definite keeper~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I added a little wine, extra tomato, since I had so many, pureed garlic , freshly ground rosemary, which made a big difference in the Italian flavor, since my Ital. seasoning seemed old. A++ recipe. Didn't feel guilty at all with seconds. Topped it off with a little garlic bread and of course a small glass of Chablis. Sorry didn't think to photo the final result. Next time.",
