These turned out to be better than almost any traditional fajitas I've ever had. Even my meat-loving 25-year-old son loved them, and wants more! Authentic Southwestern fajita flavor with a smoky touch. Very easy to make. Garnish with sour cream, salsa, and grated cheese as desired.",

                "reviewBody": "These were excellent! I wasn't sure I would like the liquid smoke but it definitely added a nice smokiness and didn't overpower. I have a couple of tips here. If you plan on marinating overnight as I did, I recommend buying avocados that are a bit firm and not too ripe. Mine were pretty ripe and they did okay but under-ripe would held together better on the grill. The other tip is that everything can be done on the grill without having to turn on the oven. Put the onion/pepper combo in a grill basket and let them cook for 5 minutes and then add your avocado slices to the grill for the last 5 minutes. You can also put the tortillas up on the top rack those remaining 5 minutes which gives them a nice char and then everything is done at the same time. Perfect summertime meal and one I will make again. Thanks for sharing!",

I only marinated  a couple of hours, I did add a splash of lemon juice, balsamic vinegar and veg Worcestershire to the mix. I used a red onion, red bell, and a couple of Portobello mushrooms to \"beef\"  things up. The avocados were somewhat firm ( per Soup Loving Nicole ) seeded, peeled and quartered for the marinade.  Then we threw everything on the grill followed by the foil wrapped corn tortillas. Served with various toppings.... cilantro, green onions, sour cream, jalapenos, grilled corn, whatever you prefer. It was delicious! The next morning I warmed the leftover vegetables and served them in tortillas(or none) with fried eggs. Very tasty, very good idea. Thank you, Elaine!",
