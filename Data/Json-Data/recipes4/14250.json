First time ever cooking pearl (Israeli) couscous which is totally different from regular couscous.  Even my DH who's not a couscous lover liked this. I was a little concerned that 1/2 cup almonds was going to be too much, but I was wrong.  The flavors really develop after chilling, so allow time for that. Please do yourself a favor, and don't change anything the first time you make this because IMO this recipe is perfect the way it's written. This is going into my Favorites folder.",
