The vanilla extract really brings the potatoes to a whole other level of delicious! I was a little worried 2 tbsp of cinnamon would be too much so I ended up using just over 1 tbsp and in retrospect 2 would have been fine. I love that these are grilled (although they could easily be made in the oven) and are the perfect pairing for grilled salmon or pork. A great way to prepare sweet potatoes in the summer months!",
