This was my first time making scallion pancakes, so that may have been a contributing factor. We order them from our local take-out places all the time, and they are usually a little bit more flaky from them (although not always perfect from them either): mine was a bit dense/doughy. I have to admit, I forgot to brush the oil on the pancakes before rolling them, so that may have contributed to the problem. We used plain soy cause as the dipping sauce, but a sauce more like one used for dumplings would be more appropriate.\n\nI would definitely make these again, and would recommend this recipe. If I can get them a bit more flaky, and if the original author would add dipping sauce recipe, I would give this 5 stars/",

Reading further in the recipe it states to use 1 teaspoon first and then a 1/2 teaspoon later.

I followed the recipe almost exactly as written--only differences were I let the dough rest for about 60 minutes (needed extra time to finish mincing the scallions) and I used less salt. This recipe calls for WAY too much salt--1/2 tsp per pancake would be excessive IMO! I just sprinkled a pinch on each one before rolling. I wasn't entirely sure what was meant by rolling the scroll into a \"disk\"--I think I did it right but that description makes me wonder. Served them with Trader Joe's Gyozo Dipping Sauce and homemade egg drop soup. This was my first time making scallion pancakes so perhaps I'll try a couple other recipes and see which I like the best.
