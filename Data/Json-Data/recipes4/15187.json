Mine turned out thick and creamy. If you like your oatmeal on the thin side I would recommend sticking to the measurements in the recipe. I've had egg whites in oatmeal before but never a whole egg. It wasn't as fluffy as with just the whites but it was good. I liked the applesauce and the little tang from the yogurt. I don't especially like blackberry yogurt so I used strawberry. The only other thing I did differently was to add some chopped pecans (after I took the pic) because I felt the need for some crunch today. One serving was very filling. Thanks for a great way to make oatmeal.",
