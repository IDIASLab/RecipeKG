I did all of the prep the night before (sliced potatoes and then kept them in cold water in the frig and sauteed the mushrooms) and tossed everything in the crock pot the next morning.  I did reduce the cheese by about a cup and had to sub light cream for milk when I realized ours smelled a bit off.  It was a nice side, but I'm not sure I'll make it again, simply because Mr. LTH didn't love it (\"it's ok\") and it's too high calorie, low nutrient to become a staple here.  THANKS, Kat!",
