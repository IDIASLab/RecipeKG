It's very quick to prepare, and can be served immediately. I like to make it at least an hour before serving, so the flavors can marry. The key ingredient is the El Pato&reg; Tomato Sauce (yellow can), which can be found in the ethnic section of your supermarket. You may have to go to a Mexican market if you can't find it at your usual supermarket. Serve with tortilla chips. Leftovers are great the next day, too!",

I actually slice the avocado into small short slivers before adding to the salsa in the last step never using large chunks. The two tomatoes in the last step are chopped into very small pieces typical for salsa. And there is absolutely no need to remove the cilantro leaves from their stems prior to blending. Just wash a large handful of cilantro thoroughly and throw it into the blender.",
