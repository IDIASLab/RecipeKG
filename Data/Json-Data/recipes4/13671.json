I doubled the sauce ingredients and trippled the water. 2. I caramelized the onion in a bit of butter then added the mushrooms it creates a rich yummy flavor. 3. I made the sauce and kept it warm while the steaks were cooking since the steak cooks so fast. 4. Just in case anyone was wondering you broil on High (the recipe doesn't specify). Over all very delicious recipe. Thanks for sharing!",
