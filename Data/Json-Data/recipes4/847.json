It worked wonderfully in this one!\n\nHEIDI8803 posted this in Raspberry Tiramisu, not sure which recipe she got it from:\nmascarpone substitute-\n2pkgs cream cheese blended with 1/2 c heavy cream and 5 T sour cream\n\nAnd, to reiterate other advice given by previous reviewers, I too made two of the three cake layers with the instant coffee (I'd've made it three, but the changing colors are beautiful) and I doubled the coffee liquer everywhere it was called for. I think next time I'm going to add chocolate covered coffee beans around the base of the cake.\n\n***Edit*** I've made this a few times now, and learned (the hard way) one big thing on the frosting: It is better to under whip than over. More than five minutes and you risk hitting an icky butter zone. That might be what happened to Nicky. Right at 5 min. works for me. Oh, and believe all the reviews about letting the cake sit overnight. The frosting will set better in that time.",

Everyone agreed it was great.  The frosting was not overly sweet like some can be.  I would, however add more coffee/liquor mixture to the layers next time.  I was afraid the cake would taste too \"boozy\", as there are members of my family that dont drink, but the taste was very subtle.  (good for those that dont like the coffee taste)  I also made the cake layers days ahead of time and simply froze them, took them out of the freezer and assembled the cake the day before the party. When I sprinkled the cocoa powder on the cake I  first carefully placed a paper \"lace\" doily on the cake top and when removed the cake had the lace pattern on top.",

I followed the instructions to detail afterward.  Follow these tips for outstanding results: 1. Instead of mixing the instant coffee into the batter, mix 1/4 cup of water with about 1 tbsp of instant cofee powder and mix into the batter.  It tastes like an awesome mocha cake. 2. Also, be generous with the coffee mixture as you're pouring it over your cakes, that way the cake is MOIST.  Don't overdo it though! 3. Buy your MASCARPONE CHEESE at Trader Joes or Sams Club (even cheaper)...it's significantly cheaper there than any other grocery store that I went to. Excellent recipe!! thank you.",

Following the advice of previous reviews, I make two of the layers with the coffee granulars and one without, doubled the Kahlua everywhere it was called for, and doubled the brewed coffee. I was amazed how fast this came together. Because the layers are so thin they cook and cool very fast. I think I had the whole thing done in under 45 minutes. As a variation, I made this recipe for my husband's birthday and left out all the coffee, kahlua, and coffee granulars and added Chambord to two of the layers, layered sliced strawberries over her marscapone cheese between the cake layers and pressed more slices into the side of the whipped cream frosting. It was very good, like a strawberry shortcake cake.",

Followed some reviewers suggestions and made 2 coffee layers. I didn't want to modify the recipe too much the first time. But next time I will double the coffee/liquor mixture for the layers and add more liquor. I also used heavy whipping cream and it was yummy and so light. Cannot wait to make this cake again!",
