                "reviewBody": "5.8.18 After mixing the croquette mixture together I put it in the fridge to chill for about 10 minutes making it easier to roll into balls. I used a 1-3/4 cookie scoop and ended up with 13 balls. The recipe lists 1/2 cup milk on one line and 2 Tbsp milk below (usually on one line when listing ingredients) so I assumed the croquettes were supposed to have all of that milk mixed in. They were a little difficult to shape into balls and in the future I might try eliminating that extra 2 Tbsp milk. I used Panko bread crumbs and after breading I put them back into the refrigerator to firm up before frying. I just held my breath when I dropped the first one into the hot oil thankfully it didn t disintegrate. The overall flavor is pretty mild and I thought the dill was totally lost even after doubling that. I know moving forward I won t spring 2.25 to buy a pkg of fresh dill; I ll either omit it or use dry (probably try the latter). Would suggest you don t chop your shrimp too small (I think I may have today) so you get a nice pop of that succulent shrimp when you bite into the croquette. Fair number of ingredients but this really is pretty easy to make. I firmly believe you need a dipping sauce for this recipe and I used Creole Marmalade Sauce also on this site. Thanks for sharing your recipe ZAYO I don t deep fry often but this was worth the effort.",
