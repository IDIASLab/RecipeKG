I doubled the recipe and cooked a few on medium and a few on medium-high and I think we prefer them darker/crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside so I think the best way to do this is to cook them in the butter for approximately two minutes on medium-high until each side is crispy and blackened and then pour in the marinade turn the heat to medium cover and cook for about 5-7 minutes until the marinade and chicken reach 165 degrees. I used the \"Taco Sauce\" recipe from this site as the first ingredient which lent a nice flavor to the dish and served this with a side of mashed potatoes (because my husband eats them with every meal) topped with \"Easy Black Beans and Tomatoes\" from this site. I also made a spinach salad as an additional side. Overall it was a nice weekday dinner (quick and easy) and my husband said the flavor of this chicken is one of his favorites. So happy we made extras for leftovers!",
