I could not find New Mexico Chiles in California, so I used a 3 oz. bag of California dried Chiles and 3 Guajillo dried pods for heat.  I used a 32 oz beef stock box from Trader Joes, 2 onions, and I added all the water from the steeping into the blender.  After 3 hours of simmering, the liquid reduces by about half and it is phenomonal.  Many Thanks.......",

You simply cannot dredge 5 pounds of cubed roast in 1/2 cup of flour so I used as much flour as it took to dredge all the meat. BIG BIG MISTAKE don't do it. I ended up with instead of sauce a nasty red paste covering the meat. I will try it again soon but this time I will only SPRINKLE a 1/2 cup of flour over the 5 pounds of cut up meat!!! It will be more like a seasoning than a dredging. I bet it will be terrific because I LOVE chile colorado!",

I was looking for an authentic yet easy version of Chile Colorado (my 2nd favorite to Chile Verde) and this recipe is it!  It's truly an authentic dish like you would get a Mexican restaurant.  Making the chili \"sauce\" was really neat - taking dried chilis and turning it into a suace.  I actually pureed the chilis in the \"soaking\" water, making a \"sauce\" about the consistency of a thick \"cream of chicken\" soup.  I too cut back a little on the beef broth, as I want a really thick sauce.  I just took a sneak taste of the sauce - incredible!  Thanks for posting the recipe!  I know this will be something I will make many more times!\r\n\r\nJoseph",

The interesting thing is Chile Colorado is supposed to be meat with a red sauce, a traditional Hispanic dish.  It isn't supposed to be made with beans thrown in it as a typical chili (not chile) would have so I am confused when people add beans to this dish.  i come from a Hispanic family and they have all made it with the meat and red sauce.  Anyhow, this recipe is perfect.  I made it with pork roast instead, which I cut up.  I also couldn't find any New Mexico chiles so used California chiles and added some New Mexico chile powder, about 1 tsp, to the sauce mixture.  Since I used pork, I used chicken broth, 2 cups, to the pot.  Served with rice, beans and tortillas.  It was fabulous.",
