It's called Bhoona and is essentially a dry-frying technique. It takes a little more consistent attention because you put, say, half the water in at first, and let it cook until the water is nearly boiled away. Then you add another couple ounces of water and cook it down again, and stop adding water when the potatoes are done.   I haven't tried this dish yet, but given the comments about the runniness, I intend to make that one little modification in the cooking process when I make it tomorrow. I'll let you know how it turns out.",
