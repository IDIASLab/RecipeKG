I cut the chili paste to two large teaspoons instead of Tablespoons - figured that I could add more if needed but it was just perfect for us.  I used a 10 oz package of dry yakisoba noodles and it was perfect.  I don't really understand the recipe calling for 2 lbs cooked noodles - none the less the 10 oz package was just the right amount.  Hubby says I can make this every week.  One of the best, if not the best Asian dishes I have ever made. Delicious!",

It was actually my first time cooking with sesame oil, and it really made it wonderful. \n\nLike another reviewer, I used low-sodium soy sauce and omitted the salt with the vegetables, and we thought it was just the right amount of saltiness.  However, we don't do a ton of salt in our house, so your preferences may vary. \n\nI scaled back the amount of chili paste (I actually used Thai Kitchen Red Curry paste because it's what I could find...it was great, but I am going to check out my options next time I'm at the Asian market).  Next time, assuming I use the same paste, I'm adding the full 2T because it was still very mild the way I did it this time (approx 1/3-1/2 T). \n\nI also used soba noodles instead of yakisoba noodles, which are actually different.  But I had them and I like them...I thought they worked just fine in this recipe.  Based on my past experiences cooking with soba noodles, I added them at the end and just cooked until they were heated through.  Otherwise, soba noodles can get too soft.  If anyone else uses soba noodles, the ~10 oz pkg (3 bundles of the kind I bought) is plenty of noodles. \n\nReally delicious recipe!  Thank you for sharing!",

I add a little less soy sauce than the recipe calls for, since as other reviewers noted, it can turn out a little too salty. I use sriracha sauce for the chili paste and the flavor is amazing. I usually drizzle a little extra sesame oil on the soba noodles to keep them from getting sticky and to add a little more flavor.",
