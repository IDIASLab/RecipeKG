The reason this works is the dark meat on the legs and bottom of the bird is denser and takes longer to cook than the white breast.  Upside down, the dark meat is in the higher, hotter part of the oven (heat rises).  Unwrap your chicken or turkey and leave it in the fridge over night to dry the skin and then rub your favorite fat and spices into the skin.  Then there's no need to baste!",

He read the directions (with some help from me) and did all the steps with me to prepare the bird. When it came out of the oven he said \"Wow we made THAT?\" After a great dinner the first night we had enough moist flavorful meat to make a wonderful chicken and pasta salad for the next night.
