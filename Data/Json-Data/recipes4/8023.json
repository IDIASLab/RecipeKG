Carrots add a pop of color and this dish pairs very well with poultry.  \n\nI have also have added leftover chunks of cooked chicken or turkey into the squash mix for a \"complete meal\".  \n\nI serve it with cranberry sauce on  the side. \n\nI've made a large batch in a disposable aluminum lasagna pan and kept it warm with my countertop roaster oven, and served it at pot luck dinners, and it's always a hit! I rarely have any to take home at the end of the evening, even when I make two pans.",
