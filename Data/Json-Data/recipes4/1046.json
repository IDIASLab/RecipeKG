I reduced the beef to about 600g as I was only serving for 2, but otherwise followed the other measurements. I also substituted with 250g Shitake mushrooms as I couldn't get buttons. I did not serve it as a garnish but instead added the onions and mushrooms during the last 30min of simmering(to make it a healthier option). I loved the extra flavour Shitake added to the dish, though I think it may be a little overpowering for non-Shitake fans. Next time, i'll experiment with both buttons and shitake. Overall, i really liked it. My home smell so heavenly the whole day. Will definitely make again. Thanks!",

So I wouldn't recommend a Pinot or a Merlot. Go for a nice California Cabernet. I marinated the beef Overnight. In addition to the parsley thyme and bay leaf I added fresh rosemary to the bouquet garni. I also marinated onions celery and carrots with the beef overnight. I separated the beef and cooked that first. Browned real well. While the beef was browning I reduced the wine marinade in a separate pot. You need to reduce the wine in a separate pot so that it doesn't make the dish bitter. Added the vegetables and the reduced wine and cooked on the stove for about 40 minutes. Came out very tender and it was delicious. I left out the bacon b/c there is enough flavor in this dish that you Do Not need to add additional fat to it. Omitted the mushrooms b/c I didn't have any. Also I used low sodium beef broth.",
