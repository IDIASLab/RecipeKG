I use my hands to press the dough into the muffin tins and I don't roll it at all. The recipe makes just enough for 12. It is a soft dough so you don't need to set aside much for the tiny top crust. I did not add rum and increased the sugar by a quarter of a cup. Halfway through the baking I put on an egg wash. I baked them at 350 for around 25 minutes. But you should check yours as they bake. I used a jar of Crosse and Blackwell Mincemeat from the supermarket. My husband loves them!",
