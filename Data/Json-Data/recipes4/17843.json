I made the recipe by half for my small family of two but still wound up getting 5 good sized patties out of it plus about a half patty worth of \"tester\" mix. I used brown lentils because that's what I had which took a bit longer to cook. I had some mashed sweet potato on hand nuked the broccoli used some precooked kale I had and cooked the onion in a little butter (which didn't matter cause I forgot the olive oil). I blended all the veggies and lentils into a paste with my immersion blender and used one egg and cracker crumbs instead of the flour paste (that's the way I always make veggie patties). I didn't use the vegetable seasoning because I didn't know what it is only salt and pepper. I fried my tester patties in oil but plan to bake the patties I've pre-formed for tonight's dinner as I find any veggie patty seems to hold together better after setting up in the fridge. They came out really delicious; I am pleased to have another veggie patty option for my repertoire.Update 2/14/17: I just made these again except as written with the spinach. I don't know what kind of portions people out there are eating but I made the full recipe which is supposed to serve four. It made TWELVE patties. Are folks eating triple patty meals?",
