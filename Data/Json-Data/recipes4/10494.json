This stands above any other poke cake I've ever made. I only made one variation as tried by another reviewer. I used the handle of a wooden spoon to poke the holes. It made a huge difference. Way more of the gelatin actually gets into the cake instead of running over and along the sides and just intensifies the flavor. Very easy to make and was a big hit at the Memorial Day cookout. I will be making this for years to come.",
