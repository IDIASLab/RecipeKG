I didn't precook the potatoes at all - just grated them assembled the whole thing in a pan and browned the bottom added a little water and put a lid on them until the potatoes steamed and were soft (which only took a few minutes) then flipped them over to brown the other side. Came out perfect. Reminds me of family vacations to Wisconsin when I was a kid. Thanks!",

I didn't make any adjustments and my husband daughter and I loved this. In fact we were fighting over who got the crispy parts (they are the best). When it was time to turn the potatoes I flipped mine over onto a plate and then slid back into the pan. They turned out beautifully. Because I only let my potatoes cool long enough that I could touch them I really didn't need to cook them very long. I basically left them in the frying pan long enough to get a crispy crust and the cheese to melt. I have to say these are a do again for sure.",

I seasoned the dish quite a bit more than called for and also added chopped onion and green peppers. Definitely good advice to flip this onto a plate rather than trying to turn it in the pan. To make turning a little easier I think I'll make individual sevings the next time I serve this dish. Thanks Bob.",
