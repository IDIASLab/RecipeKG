I did add mushrooms to the pepper and onion mixture.\n\nI will make these again, but I will be more careful when measuring!  I made a mistake and used too much cayenne.  My sons were able to eat it, but the oldest mouth was burning!  Grumpy \"grumped\" because he hates that \"mexican food\" but he ate it anyway.  These get 5 stars because I loved them and my youngest son loved them - even with too much heat!  My oldest son would have liked them more if I hadn't messed up the cayenne....",

I used the fajita seasoning as a dry rub let it sit then slipped it in my traditional fajita marinade to chill overnight. (As the first time I tried this recipe it was a bit dry just using the rub...might have been the cut of venison I had used as well). Came out extremely flavorful as I cooked down the marinade with the onions and peppers. This will definitely go into the rotation again once our freezer is stocked again.
