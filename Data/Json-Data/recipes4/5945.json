I do make a few adjustments though; first I pre-cook the bacon until it's about half done, I don't like mushy sprouts and that's what you get in order for the bacon to crisp up. Next I pour the bacon, any grease from the pre-cooking, the syrup, sprouts and s&p in a bowl and mix it all up, then I add just enough olive oil to coat usually only a couple of tablespoons is needed. I definitely line my baking sheet with foil because the syrup really gets sticky and I cook at 400 for only about 20 minutes. These small adjustments make it perfect every single time.",

Next time I will half them and they should be done in about 15 minutes (the minimum time I think you need for the bacon to cook)  I took mine out way before the 40 minutes and they where  whole and they were cooked through to tender.  I would also just put the olive oil to coat maybe several tablespoons 1/4 of a cup is a lot especially with the bacon rendering out fat.  Make sure you line your pan with foil or you will need a jack knife to clean your pan.  I would be willing to try this again with these modifications.",

I use the fat from the bacon and some olive oil to just coat, but not 1/4 C.  The bacon makes more fat while it continues to cook.  I add garlic and walnuts.  Thank you for sharing.
