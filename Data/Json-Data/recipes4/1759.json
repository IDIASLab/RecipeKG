The only other change I made was to only fry this for a few minutes, just until the the breadcrumbs browned a bit. Then I baked at 350 for 20 minutes on a wire rack. This will be a \"make again\".

Next time I will double the jalapenos and also add some garlic salt and/or onion powder to the cheese mixture. I will also dust the outside with garlic salt to get a little more flavor out of this dish but the recipe is a great starting point and probably great for those with less heat-tolerance.",

We are partial to spicier foods so I added extra doses of Jalapeno peppers plus added paprika black pepper and crushed red pepper to the bread crumb coating. I also opted to bake it instead of the pan fry. It was cheesy and spicy spilling from the moistest chicken! My kids had seconds and my husband thought this would be a hit at his fall football gathering! I made it again for my parents who don't eat the peppers substituting mushrooms and asparagus tips with the cheeses and garlic salt and mustard seed in the coating. Great alternative. A recipe I will for sure be making again!!!",

Filled the \"pocket\" with a seeded intact half of a jalapeno instead of mincing the pepper and couple TBS of the cheese mix. Held them together with toothpicks and used a pan that can be soaked clean! The chix was preseasoned (roasted garlic); the cream cheese was a combo of what I had - whipped cr ch and onion/chive with shredded cheddar/monterey jack. I did pre-cook the peppers in the microwave after cutting/seeding - one minute zap.",
