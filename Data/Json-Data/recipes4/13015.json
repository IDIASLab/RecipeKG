I used Chorizo sausage which I first browned along with a can ( 4 oz. ) of green chiles and around 10 oz of picante sauce ( medium ). Salt and peppered 2. Removed from heat and cut the browned sausage ( 1 lb ) in rounds ( still pink in center ) and added to slow cooker - which already had the cheddar soup and water mixed in. 3. Added a 1/2 packet of taco seasoning. 4. Cooked for an additional hour on High and added another 3/4 cup water. I also did not stir frequently as I think this defeats the purpose of a slow cooker. 5. Added extra cheddar cheese. I let it this dish sit overnight as well. Very well received by my wife. There was a nice background heat to a traditional baked mac and cheese taste. This was not a standard creamy out of the box Velveeta meal.",

I didn't care for the sausage and since it was not in for very long its flavor did not permeate the dish and the sausage itself didn't get nice and soft like other sausage slow cooker recipes that I make. Add to that the cost of this recipe after you hunt down andouille sausage (6.99 for the package the ONLY type at my grocery store) and I was looking at 15 for a pretty generic meal. It seems like this would be made just as easily making the sauce on the stove and preparing the noodles separately to give them the best consistency. On the positives - I thought that the sauce was really great. It's nice and creamy and quite tasty. I know it seems blasphemous to not use real cream or milk in mac and cheese but I always find that dishes made with cream sauce never reheat very nicely. If I make this again I will forget the sausage and go straight for mac-n-cheese and only if I can get the entire dish for under 5",
