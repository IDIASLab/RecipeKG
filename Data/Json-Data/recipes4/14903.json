                "reviewBody": "Absolutely AMAZING! After my husband ordered a similar meal at a local restaurant, I went on the hunt for a recipe and found this one. It turned out head and shoulders better than the one for which we paid $11. I did make a few variations only because I was working with ingredients on hand, but I think that is just a testimony to how firm a foundation this recipe is in that it allows for wiggle room. My point being that I didn't make changes to \"make it better\" - I simply think this recipe is so good it allows room for them.\nI skipped the jalapeno and celery, and used sundried tomatoes instead of fire-roasted, as well as a bouillon cube instead of soup base paste. Also, I am embarrassed to say that I was out of Cajun seasoning (I ALWAYS have it, so didn't check), but the flavor of the andouille sausage more than made up for the lack, so don't let that stop you. Oh, and I used quick grits rather than regular because, well, I always do! With the milk and cheese, they were divinely creamy.  \nI know it is supposed to serve 8, but 4 adults had no problem polishing it off. Did I mention how good this is? Yeah, that might have had something to do with how much we ate!\nA bit of advice - if you have never cooked grits before, use a large pot. They like to boil over and that is a huge mess.  Also, soak your pot and whisk as soon as you are done otherwise they turn into a substance that makes concrete look soft. :)\nSeriously, this is a wonderful guest-worthy meal.",
