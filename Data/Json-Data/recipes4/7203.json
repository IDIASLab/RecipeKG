I made them exactly as directed adjusting to only 1/2 teaspoon of salt because I also used salted butter. If using unsalted butter I would use the full teaspoon. Golden and crisp on the outside fluffy and tender inside. This recipe made 6 large round Belgian style waffles. Tip: Melt butter and warm syrup to drizzle over your hot waffle as soon as it comes out. Nobody wanted to wait to dress their waffle before digging in.;-) I have had a very expensive waffle maker in my cabinet for years but waffles always seemed labor intensive because of separating out egg whites folding in later. No more. We will make these again and again. I am hooked and so is my family.",
