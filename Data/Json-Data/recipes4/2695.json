This is a chili that only gets better the second day so don't worry about using a large pot and having more than your family can eat the first night because you can have it a couple of nights later. ENJOY. I know I do every time I make this chili.",

I made this for an event and used one can of butter beans one can of kidney beans and one can of pinto beans (same sized cans). It was a hit!
