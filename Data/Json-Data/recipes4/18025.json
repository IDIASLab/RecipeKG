Really great flavor! The rice tasted awesome before I even added the veggies lol. The only change I would make next time would be to reduce the cayenne by half b/c it was a bit too spicy for the girls (the guys loved it that way). Oh and when I heated the oil in the pan I cooked the veggies a bit first just to soften them up slightly. Really nice recipe and a definite keeper YUM! thanks for sharing.:)",
