I also used only one pork tenderloin (there's 4 of us) and grilled it. The next time I may decide to double the sauce - it's that good. I used regular white mushrooms which I sauteed ahead of time and used the liquid from that. I substituted chicken broth for the water. I used brandy instead of cognac. You certainly don't need a 1/2 cup of the herbs. A few shakes did it for me. A perfect dish to impress company or your family. EDIT: I've made this numerous times. Along with I said above I use regular sliced white mushrooms and I simmer the mushrooms with vidalia onion (in place of shallots) in chicken stock - equal to the amount of water listed in the recipe. when the mushroom are cooked through I add the other ingredients according to the recipe. Much easier and very tasty. 1/2 lemon is not enough and a whole lemon is too much so I'm somewhere in the middle with how much I add.",

Used white button mushrooms instead of porcini. Anyway it still came out perfectly. My husband and I both raved about how good it was. The honey was an especially great addition to the sauce.
