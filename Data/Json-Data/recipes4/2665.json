Added a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes and kept the thighs whole. Added the broth from the poached chicken as needed and salt. Since I prefer food with substance didn't blend and added some fresh green beans. This was absolutely wonderful. Not one spice overpowers the other one. I did add 3 cloves garlic but again I'm a garlicholic. You can taste the individual spices and they add different levels of flavor to the dish. Wow! again a great new Indian recipe for us Indian food lovers! Served w/\"Indian Style Basmati Rice\" from Allrecipes.",

Then I found it to be a little too tomatoey and spicey so I added about a cup of plain yogourt which did the trick. Also when pureeing it I would advise you to puree the onions and cumin first cuz the cumin seeds stay whole if pureeing with the tomatoes. Also I used beef pieces(for stir fry) and sauteed them a bit in the pan before adding the rest. It came out really good. I loved the flavor of the spices together. Served with basmati rice.",

I threw mine together using a 15oz can of diced tomatoes and used 3 cloves of garlic instead of one. I too like another reviewer am a garlicaholic. I actually had a blender handy and pureed it real quick and it turned out great! I threw it on top of some whole grain rice and it made a great meal. Also when it says simmer gently I d recommend placing a lid partway over it. The sauce is thick making the bubbles bigger causing it to splatter a bit.",
