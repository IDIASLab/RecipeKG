I used whole wheat elbow macaroni reduced fat sour cream and half Velveeta and half shredded cheddar cheese. (It gives it more of a flavor like the macaroni and cheese that Mom made for me when I was a kid with gov'ment cheese.) I don't normally keep saltines on hand so I used crushed Ritz crackers. I didn't get to try this but my husband and boys seemed to like it so much that nothing remains. I served this with leftover bacon wrapped meatloaf and a fresh green salad.",

I used 2% Velveeta cheese, light sour cream and 2% milk. I didn\u2019t have enough sour cream, as doubling called for a full 2 cups, I only had a bit over one cup, and so I grated some Colby Jack cheese along with the parmesan cheese (which I eyeballed both amounts, but probably totaled a cup and half together of shredded cheese).  I also didn\u2019t have any crackers so I topped with French Fried Onions (the kind you use on green bean casserole). I spiced it with some shakes of black pepper, cayenne pepper and granulated garlic powder; along with the fried onions on top it had a marvelous flavor to it. If I don\u2019t have the fried onions, I would add a teaspoon of onion powder to it also. I baked just the mac and cheese mixture covered for thirty minutes, then uncovered and topped with the fried onions and baked another eight minutes until lightly golden brown. For those that did try this and felt it was missing something, try the fried onions on top in lieu of the crackers. This is now our official mac and cheese recipe\u2026and we\u2019ve tried quite a few on this website\u2026thanks for submitting.",
