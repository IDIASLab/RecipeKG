After much griping from the hubby about spending that much on pimento cheese every week, I finally decided to try it myself & I am so glad I did. This blows farmer's market guy out of the water. The 1 tiny change I made was that I just used a hand mixer to mix the cream cheese, Mayo & spices. I folded in the grated cheese, jalapeno, & pimentos so it would maintain a chunky texture.",

I had been looking for a recipe to duplicate it and this is very close. I left out the optional ingredients and I didn't have pimentos but I had some small diced red peppers and used that. I made 1/2 recipe and it made about a cup and a half. The only thing that seemed to be missing was the sharper taste of the spread the store sampled and then I realized that the recipe suggested \"extra-sharp cheddar\" so I would use that specifically. The cheese should also not be pre-shredded, both are important for the flavor and texture. This will be great with crackers or to make grilled cheese out of this week. Thank you!",
