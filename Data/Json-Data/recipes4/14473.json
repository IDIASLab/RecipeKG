I only used 1/4 cup Kahlua mixed with 1/4 cup of coffee to keep the alcohol to a bare minimum, and instead of cool whip I made home-made sweetened whipped cream, and I used chocolate fudge flavored pudding mix.  I also chopped up a giant Hershey Symphony milk chocolate bar with toffee and almond pieces, and added some in each layer along with some caramel and chocolate sauce drizzled around.
