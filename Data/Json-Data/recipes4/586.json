I was very happy that the middle did not come out soggy.  One of the pans I ended up baking a bit longer and it was still excellent.  I did make some modifications that went well.  I put almost a pound of mild cheddar cheese in each casserole.  Six slices was not nearly enough for my Wisconsin raised husband.  I didn't exactly trim the bread well and it didn't make a difference. All I used was one small onion for one of the casseroles.  3 seemed way to overpowering.  The other casserole I left without onion.  What I would suggest for others is spray the bottom of the pan with cooking spray just \"incase\".  Also, you can use less egg/milk and still end up with a good casserole.",

After cooking it for 2 hours (until the top and bottom were nearly black) the casserole was still very soggy in the middle.  (My oven temp. is accurate too.)  I think the recipe has potential.  Maybe use half of the milk.  I tried turning the oven down and letting it cook for 2 hours, so I do think it is a problem with the 4 cups of milk.  Still, I'm not daring enough to try it again.
