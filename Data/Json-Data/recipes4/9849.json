I added about an 1/8 tsp. or so of poutry seasoning and used chicken broth instead of water just because another reviewer said it was bland. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was delicious. I used Stove Top Sage flavored for the stuffing mix. Very easy and has a nice homemade taste. I wouldn't serve it for Thanksgiving dinner but for a quick stuffing it's awesome.",
