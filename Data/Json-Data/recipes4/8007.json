We doubled the recipe and added twice as much ginger. Then we added about 1.5 teaspoons nutmeg. The flavors came together very well. We rolled them up and put them in the fridge overnite. The next day we coated them with melted white chocolate or rolled them in crushed pecans. We have about 50 of these. We also made the Easy Decadent Truffles and the Peanut Butter Balls III from this site.",
