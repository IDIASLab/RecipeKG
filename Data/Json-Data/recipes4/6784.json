The only changes I made were I used a whole pound of bacon (it was just easier), I used regular tomatoes (both yellow and red) because I didn't have any cherry ones, and I ended up using green leaf lettuce because my rinky dink grocery store didn't have arugula - I could have used fresh spinach I guess.  I also made Chef John's creme fraiche ahead of time (although I could have cut it in half for this recipe - you can find the recipe on this site.)  The creme fraiche made this recipe so plan ahead to make this dish.  I would not substitue it for anything since I've already done it this way! The creme fraiche didn't overwhelm the other flavors but gave it a subtle richness.  I should have taken a picture because the yellow and red tomatoes along with the green lettuce made an attractive dish.  My teenagers also loved this and I know my husband would have, but he was out of town and by the time he got home the leftovers were gone. Poor guy.  I didn't think it was as good left over as it was fresh though. This dish is now in my permanent rotation forever and always!",

As is my custom, I went through the comments looking for suggestions and found a few.  Cr\u00e8me fraiche became sour cream.  Ditalini pasta became Fred Mayer\u2019s small stuff that was on sale two weeks ago.  Argula became spinach.  Maybe argula is finer chopped than spinach but four cups of chopped spinach just about overflowed my 12 inch by 1 \u00bd inch iron skillet.  Next time I\u2019ll cut back to three cups.  I found a way to cut down on the mess from chopping spinach while at the same time getting it done faster and doing a better job.  Having not ever seen a recipe requiring whole spinach leaves, I just chopped up the whole plastic container of Freddy\u2019s baby spinach leaves using the scissor-like multi-bladed chopping tool that the boss cook bought on one of her Pampered Chef forays.",
