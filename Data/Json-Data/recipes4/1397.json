One thing to remember, which I didn't do my first time making this recipe, is to remove and discard the stem end and the string from each pod.  If you don't do this you will be chewing on the stem and string and will have to spit it out which is not too appealing, other than that this is a very, very good vegetable dish.  Way to go CC!!",
