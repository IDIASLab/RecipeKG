I ended up pouring it into my slow cooker adding a can of Italian tomatoes tomato paste chicken bouillon a couple of teaspoons of Italian seasoning pinch of brown sugar more garlic and about 1 1/2 cups of pasta I had on hand. This recipe is a good place to start but really needed so much tweaking that it became a whole different recipe. I am glad I started this meal early in the day as my plans were to cook it put in the frig until dinner time because tomato based soups normally taste better the longer the flavors mingle but as it turned out the slow cooker worked well after all the additions. Didn't add the pasta until the last 15 minutes and put cheese in the bottom of the bowl before laddling the soup.",
