I've made it many times, but changed it quite significantly. \n\nI find the recipe workes best when I do the following -- \n\nREPLACE the vegetable oil with olive (healthier), the canned soup with 28 oz crushed tomatoes, the canned chillies with a jalapeno (seeds and ribs removed), the coco with 1 oz unsweetened dark chocolate, the dry garlic and cilantro with fresh. \n\nADD cayenne peppers and coriander (to taste) plus one handful of finely ground almonds. Simmer it with about one pound of cooked chicken and add the cilantro close to the end of the cook time. Serve it over brown rice  or in tortillas, toped with reduced-fat cheese, a dollop of light sour, or diced fresh cilantro. My favorite part:  with the addition of olive oil, dark chocolate and almonds this dish offers a nice supply of anti-oxidants, which have been found in studies to lower blood pressure and protect the heart.

I used 2 oz. of actual dark chocolate because that is what authentic mole sauce uses. I used a lot less tomato sauce (instead of soup) because it tasted too much like doctored tomato soup. I added 2 tbsp cinnamon and more cumin also some cayenne pepper for some spice. I left out the cilantro and peppers according to my own preference.  Mine turned out PERFECT! Thanks!",
