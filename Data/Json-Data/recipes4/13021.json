Your recipe needs variety and necessary additions. Try rotating protein sources (chicken, beef, fish,... and once a week supplementing with organs) and adding an omega-3 rich egg (cook the white, serve the yolk raw) at least once per day. You might vary your grains with rolled oats (which I first process to make into a flour, then simply add to food w/ warm broth before serving my dogs' meals), alternated with enriched white rice, long grain brown rice, and medium grain brown rice (cooked LONGER than for human consumption!). Also, add fresh vegetables lightly steamed and mashed such as carrots, squash, sweet potato, yam, peas, etc., and even apples once in awhile. Most importantly, you really should be adding cottage cheese or plain yogurt with every meal. Use a calcium supplement (at least 300 mg daily) and a multi. Adding alfalfa powder or other greens is necessary for cleansing the blood and immune health. Finally, if only one supplement is to be used, a good enzyme for dogs is imperatve. I use a great multi complex by \"Only Natural Pet,\" calcium, alfalfa powder, an Omega 3-6-9 capsule, acidophilus (or other probiotic), and occasionally an enzyme. My dogs are athletes, their health and nutrition are very important!",

They've been on the exact same thing for 6 years.Sometimes I change it around with turkey or beef liver. At the suggestion of our Vet, I sprinkle in the garlic from one capsule I buy at the health food store. Its just enough to keep the fleas away but won't hurt the \"furry kids\". Also, to protect joints a bit of bonemeal after the cooking process. I steam the rice and boil the chicken separately. I use a frozen veggie mix with corn, green beans, carrots and peas. Broccoli, brussel sprouts and cauliflower should not be used because it can cause gas in dogs. Thanks for sharing this with everyone LuvsNow17",

My dog loves this rice meat veggies meal. Try Wacky Mac noodles instead of rice (or tri-color rotini) for a change. If you are worried your doggy is not getting enough nutrients buy some pet tabs and give along with meals. My dog eats a small amount of broccoli in the vegetable mix he gets but he has never had detectable gas. I throw it all into an iron skillet thinly coated with olive oil and cook for about 12 or so minutes. Capi says 'Yum'!",
