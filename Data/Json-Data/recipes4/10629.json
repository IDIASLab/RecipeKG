For convenience I bought Louis Rich \"oven style\" cooked chicken breast. It's already cooked and cubed and I just had to measure it out. Expensive way to do it but great if you're short on time and it's delicious chicken. I made this dish for someone who doesn't care for water chestnuts but they are chopped small so it's the crunchiness that stands out not the taste. They really added to the dish and I would not omit them.",

I'm always amazed at some of the negative comments on this site---it was bland, it had 'way too much mayo', etc.  Are these cooks who don't have a clue how to modify a recipe to their tastes, or what??\r\nThis family loved the dish, Jodi.
