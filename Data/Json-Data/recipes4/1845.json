I also prepared the burritos without the lettuce and tomatoe, put them in a 9X13 pan, topped them with the sauce and cheese and baked them at 250 degrees for about 20 minutes until hot and bubbly.  Then I served them on a bed of lettuce and topped with tomatoe and greeen onion.This was of restaurant quality when finished!",

                "reviewBody": "Very good and pretty easy to make. I think this is a five star recipe if added to the monthly rotation, but if looking for a special meal, I would give it four stars.  Anyways, like many other reviewers I made a few changes.  First sauteed small whole onion and 2 cloves of garlic in large skillet.  Then added 1 tsp cumin and 3/4 tsp oregano, then added ground beef.  After pink was gone from the meat I added the can of refried beans, the green chilies and a can of Rotel.  Moved the pan to a cool area and added cilantro. For the sauce I wanted to avoid the \"tomatoey\" flavor that other reviews tended to dislike so I eliminated the tomato sauce altogether.  Instead I mixed two 10 oz cans of enchilada sauce with the one 15 oz can of chili without sauce. To serve, I placed a small amount of the sauce in a 9x13 pan and then rolled the burritos and placed them in the pan, then covered them with the remainder of the sauce and a mixture of medium and sharp cheddar cheese.  Baked in a 350 degree oven for about 10-15 minutes.  Then covered the top of the pan with shredded lettuce, fresh tomato and green onions.  Overall pretty happy with the result.  Made 12 and found I needed two 9x13 pans.  Family ate 1 pan the first night and the 2nd the next and loved it.  Thanks for such an easy recipe...  Very nice on a school night.",

This is quick and easy, and can use ingredients most people have on hand. And the quality of your ingredients is the key. You have to choose an enchilada sauce that you already know is good, a lot of cheap enchilada sauce is bitter, which will make this terrible. It is common sense, and if you are like me, you will know right away by reading the recipe if this is something healthy. People need to quit being so mean!

I baked them instead of microwaved them I like them a little crispier and I used a little bit more cheese. We also like to garnish with black olives!
