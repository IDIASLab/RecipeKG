I was short on time, and since this makes such a huge meat loaf I separated it into 4 small ones and cooked two of them for 35 minutes and did the other two while we ate.  Me and my three young'ns ate one of them and saved one in the fridge for tomorrow.  The other two are going in the freezer.  Great recipe!  Definitely a keeper!",

Fabulous!! Also added a dash of hot sauce to the topping because we like it spicy. This one is going in the regular rotation for sure!! (BTW: Hubby had a little spaz over the zucchini but it really didn't affect the flavor. You could see it still if you are trying to be sneaky you might want to peel it first.)",

Either way I decided to try this meatloaf because I love the taste of ranch burgers on the grill and zucchini. Although in the taste of the end product I couldn't really taste the zucchini but I wouldn't leave it out as it more likely added some neccessary moisture. Either way all the flavors such as the green peppers all mingled together to make a nice tasting meatloaf. If I made again I would definitely at least use lean ground beef. And I really did like the topping of mixing the ketchup with the A-1. I have never done that before. I even added a little more A-1 on the top and put back in the oven for about 5 more minutes when it was done. I believe any man would really like this meatloaf.",
