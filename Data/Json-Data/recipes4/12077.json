I like to sprinkle about half the chili powder directly on the chicken as I'm browning it. You can experiment with the veggies. I use frozen green beans. I also like to add a can of mushrooms and about 6oz. frozen spinach but that's not for everyone. Finally for anyone doing South Beach this is Phase 1 friendly if you omit the rice. For Phase 2 use brown or wild rice.",
