I sweetened the recipe with Splendid to enhance the flavor, reducing the dry bitterness. I also added a sprinkle of salt.  1/2 tsp vinegar helps preserve the homemade mustard, which begins to decline as soon as it is mixed.  Adding an acid such as vinegar or rice wine stops the reaction and preserves the sharp edge if you are not using up in one sitting.",
