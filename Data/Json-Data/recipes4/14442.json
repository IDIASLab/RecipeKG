Loved the subtle flavor of the horseradish. I made as written but as the submitter told me that the original recipe did not call for the water I left it out. I am glad I did as it would have been far too thin had I added it. It makes a lot yielding about 8 cups of sauce for me. I just put the extra in the freezer for another meal. Looking forward to it!
