I worried about the texture when I put it in and it came out with a lot of liquid. I think next time I'll add some crackers to the mixture as well as sprinkling them on top. Really the only things I change was I used 2 yellow squash and 2 zucchini and I tossed in the squash/zucchini with the other vegetables to cook just a touch (not all the way through.) When I realized it wasn't as thick as I hoped I put it on top of some refried beans and it was great! I think I might strain out some water and use this as either taco salad topper or layer this with some tortillas for a Southwest casserole. The flavor is EXCELLENT - just gonna play with it to get the texture I want.",

I also used a combination of yellow summer squash and zucchini and I upped the amount of salsa and added a can of corn. I made this twice and once I added chicken. I also used coconut oil instead of olive oil. EVOO doesn't have a high smoke point so is not good for cooking but coconut oil does and is very good for you. I also didn't put cheese on top just mixed into the casserole. I added more of the cracker mix at the bottom than called for to soak up so liquid. I came out perfect and very Delicious.",
