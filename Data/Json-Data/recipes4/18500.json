I was a little worried that it would be too sweet, but the ras el hanout seasoning tied everything together and a dollop of greek yogurt on top of each serving provided a cool, creamy contrast to the seasoning.  We did make the ras el hanout based on the cooks notes and we had all the spices available at home.  Thanks for this delicious recipe Hunt's!",

The amount of fruit made it too sweet for a savory stew. I cooked the veggies for an hour (vs the recommended 30\") and they still were not the correct consistency. I think you just can expect a quick stove-top soup to match the slow-cooking of a real tagine. Maybe a slow cooker recipe would be a closer match.",
