What I have found that works great for incubation is to seperate the milk/yogurt starter mixture into small mason jars put the jars in a pot and fill the pot with enough water to come up to where the milk/yogurt mixture is in the jars. Then put a candy thermometer in the water. Turn the burner on really low and get the water to between 110 and 120 degrees and keep it there for 4-6 hours. Worked like a charm and then you just put the lids on the jars and pop them in the fridge and you have individual servings all ready to go!",

If it isn't thick enough in the morning I set the oven for 100 and leave it for a couple hours. Delicious! I was intimidated to try making yogurt and thought you had to have the yogurt machine. Now I will now be making it at least twice a week without the added nuisance of a machine taking up space. My son can eat 2-3 small containers a day (and he's only 6 1/2) and he loves this so it is going to save us a lot of money. I just made this again and wanted to add that fresh yogurt is already sweet! Who Knew!",
