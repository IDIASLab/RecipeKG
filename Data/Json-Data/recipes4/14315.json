It can be made fresh, browning the meat then tossing all the ingredients together in the slow cooker, or it can be prepared ahead of time for freezing and quick assembly for a quick crock pot meal when you need it! I like to make fresh stew, but double the ingredients and freeze the second portion for a quick dose of comfort food mid-week.",

My husband raved about it while he was eating it, mentioned it again later that night, and then raved again when we had leftovers the next night.    I cooked the beef stew on low overnight and had my husband shut it off when he got up so it would cool enough for me to put it in the refrigerator before I left for work.  It was so good I couldn't stop taking bites.    That night, I let it simmer on the stove for about an hour while I made some corn bread to go with it and I had all I could do not to take a bowl.   But I convinced myself to wait until I thickened it and it was so worth it.    I made no changes to the recipe other than not putting in the mushrooms (my husband hates them) and I used regular paprika and diced tomatoes since that is what I had.  I had never put tomatoes in a beef stew but I really think it added something.    Thanks for sharing.",

I added some spices from another recipe - one heaping teaspoon rosemary, one teaspoon parsley and two bay leaves.  What flavor!  Because several people commented that there was too much juice, I only used 1 can of beef broth instead of three.  As it cooked it became plenty juicy.  Then after 11 hours in the crock pot I removed about a cup of juice, boiled it and added the cornstarch to thicken.  Then I added it back to the crock pot and stirred.  Perfect!

I read the reviews about most of the seasoning getting lost in the excess flour so instead of a resealable bag I seasoned the beef in a container w/ a lid and shook untill the meat was seasoned evenly. Then I added 2 tbsp of flour and shook again. The meat was coated prefectly w/ out loosing any flavor. Other than that I made everything else as written. This was very good but very classic nothing extrodinary. I will not be making this again.",

I did thicken the gravy a bit more at the end by spooning the juice into another pan and thickening it separately then mixing it back in to the slowcooker... turned out wonderfully delicious!
