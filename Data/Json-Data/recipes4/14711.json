But first at all use smoked pork belly instead of cooked ham and please please NO kielbasa.Instead check if you can find a german butcher who can provide you with PINKEL WURST.Thats the stuff that has to go in there.Next you can use Nutmeg but allspice is better and more onion ( 3 - 4 )and you have to cook it for hours.The longer the better.( 2 - 3 hours)Last but not least you can use kale out of the can or glass as long as it is unseasoned.Thats it.Enjoy your Gruehnkohl",
