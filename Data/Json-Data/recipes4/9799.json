It's especially good during the cold winter months as it is very rich and filling. I made it the first time as written, and have since made the following changes.  I only gave it four stars because I think it's much better with fresh vegetables instead of canned.  I used three yukon gold potatoes (peeled and cubed) five or six carrots (peeled and coined) about 1 1/2 TBS dried dill weed, a 32 oz. jar of sauerkraut with the juice, and a little extra chicken broth.  Also, I leave out the garlic.  With these changes it's a fantastic meal if you're a sauerkraut lover!  It really reminds me of the sauerkraut soup at the Polish restaurant in my hometown.  ",

Browned sausage first drained it wiped out most of grease from the oven. Added the onions carrots and mushrooms. Let them cook til onions were clear. Added 3 diced yukon gold potatoes kraut broth. Didn't have cream of soups but didn't miss them at all. Added a bit of oregano instead of dill as that's what was on hand and extra garlic. Makes a lot so we'll be freezing at least half. Thanks for the great recipe. Will be making again!!",

It shredded nicely in the soup and made it more of a hearty meal. I also used fresh potato s and carrots which worked out great as well.",
