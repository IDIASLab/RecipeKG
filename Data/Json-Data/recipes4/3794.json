I just made the chicken and I'm very impressed. I had to make my own Garam Masala as I didn't have any pre-made. This was a very educational process. Just look at the number of Garam Masala recipes on this site alone. I chose one and loved the results. Those folks that didn't like this recipe should do some research on how to make your own. The variations of ingredients mean that every time you make this recipe it can taste different from the last time you made it. I'm going to use variations on more chicken shrimp talapia etc. I think this recipe is a true winner for how easy it is to make yet how complex the flavors can be with some effort.
