No only is this delicious but also healthy and hip-friendly.\nWhat I do different is that instead of the dressing i use lemon, salt, pepper and just a little olive oil.  This helps to enhace the flavor of the other ingredients, not fight them.\nI use about 1/4 cup of fresh, chopped cilantro (the flavor secret herb!), fresh chopped tomatoes (you are going to see the difference in flavor, consistency and low the sodium), 1 clove of fresh garlic instead of the powder one.  I use the beans i cook (we always have home cooked beans in almost every home in Guatemala)but have try the canned ones, just rinse them and let them dry, the same with the sweet corn.  The jalapeno is optional for me, since i don't like spice food I leave out, but for the guys I added.  One last thing, let stand on the fridge for at least 1 day to let all the flavors come together.",

                "reviewBody": "This was good.  From all of the rave reviews, I may have initially been expecting it to be a little better.   But I have to say, this salsa really is addicting.  One that you find yourself mindless munching on and going back for more.  Did make the following minor changes - used frozen corn (thawed while marinating), only half cup of dressing, added fresh garlic, 2 seeded plum tomatoes (in addition  to the canned), juice of 1 lime, a little cumin, fresh Cilantro and then added Avocado just before serving.  Personally, I think the above changes (especially the Cilantro and Avocado) add to this dish.  Marinating salsa overnight really helps improve the flavor.  May continue to tweak recipe slightly, but will definitely make this again!  Thanks!  FYI - For those who don\u2019t care for black-eyed peas (like me), you really can\u2019t taste them once done.",

I've made small changes each time I have made this and yes it is even better the next day. Today's batch went something like this: Frozen sweet corn instead of canned fresh Roma tomatoes instead of canned 1/2 cup each red and orange bell pepper for color and sweetness I omit the green pepper. Red onion for color fresh chopped garlic instead of powder 1/4 C red wine vinegar 1/4 C rice vinegar 1/2 C italian dressing. We are not cilantro lovers so I do not add that but many others do.",

I omitted the garlic powder since the dressing I used is pretty garlicy.  I used Newman's Own Family Recipe Italian (I think that's what it's called).  I was going to use fresh cilantro, but accidently picked up parsley, so I ended up using dried cilantro which was fine.  I used fresh chopped cherry tomatoes and one small jalapeno.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and just added onions and bell peppers to my taste.  ***One thing to note:  I happened to have this recipe and I only made it once.  A friend made this for a get-together and I loved it.  She gave me the recipe and I made it and I didn't like it even a little bit.  Now that I think about it, it must have something to do with the brand of Italilan dressing I used (which was probably Kraft Italian).  So, just make sure that you use a dressing that you like when you make this.",
