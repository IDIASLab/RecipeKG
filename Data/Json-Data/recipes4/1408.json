I am not a huge exact measurment person, so I threw in the beef, approximate amounts of onion, celery and green pepper.  I drained all but 1 can of beans (I used dark red, light red and white kidney beans.)  I used 1 can of puree and 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chilis.  I used the recommended seasonings, approximately, but used tobasco instead of the chili sauce that I didn't have.  I cooked for 6 hours on high.  This was really hearty with the right ammount of sauce.  We stirred in sour cream and cheddar cheese and topped with cheddar french fried onions (way to load up the calories, but boy was it good!!!)",
