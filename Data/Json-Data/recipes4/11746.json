It is however a reasonably good healthy substitute. After reading the first review I had really low expectations for the recipe but I pressed on as I adore Italian beef sandwhiches and longed for a substitute that would fit in with the healthy lifestyle that I've adopted since I left Chicago for LA. As the first reviewer noted it smelled great as it cooked. I left it slow cook for a little more than 10 hours (not much like 10 hours and 15 minutes) and it was very nicely tender and the flavors of the other ingrediants had penetrated nicely into the meat. I tasted it right out of the cooker and I definitely did not feel like it was bland. My plan was to eat these sandwiches for lunch this week so I packed up a container of the meat (with peppers onions and juice) a whole wheat French role and yes a container of cheddar cheese and hot peppers. I reheated the meat at lunch put it the French role and covered the meat with the Cheddar and hot peppers - just like Portillos - and took a bite. I thought it was great. I will definitely use the other half of the Turkey breast to cook this recipe again.",
