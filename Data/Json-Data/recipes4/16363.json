I add season all, old bay, any seasons that you like to the rice krispies.  Then I place the chicken in a pizza pan or cookie sheet, and then if there are any rice crispies left over I put them on top and  put some melted butter/margarine on top then bake at 350.  It is my family's favorite recipe.  The rice krispies are awesome when they are cooked. I am not saying that you have to   change the recipe, just suggesting for people who might not want to fry.",
