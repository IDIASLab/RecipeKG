No black cumin seeds to be found so I doubled up on the regular cumin seeds. Found the recipe to be a little bland so I added 1/2tsp of cayenne pepper and 1 tsp of curry powder. I used fresh thick cod filets and found them too delicate for the recipe. Next time I will use stripe bass or blackfish, All in all a pleasant flavor.",
