        "description": "For people that are gluten-intolerant, low-carb, paleo, or whatever, it can be hard to go without pizza. This dish makes it a lot easier. It is made pretty much exactly the same as pizza, but with ground beef as the crust. Sounds weird at first, but it is absolutely delicious and very filling. This is something great to make ahead of time and then eat as leftovers later on. It's great hot or cold, just like pizza! I find that if you make 6 square slices, each slice is usually more than enough to fill you up. Feel free to add whatever toppings you normally eat on pizza. It will taste just as good!",

I really like the way that this came out EXCEPT for one exception.  It was really salty. The recipe calls for 1 T of salt plus garlic salt and I will never make it that way again.  I think I will just use garlic powder and not add salt at all.  The pepperoni and tomato sauce have enough salt to go around.  Other than that I thought it was very tasty.

I added Italian seasoning and didn't use caraway seeds. I added green and black olives, fresh mushrooms, pepperoni, and a Mexican blend cheese.
