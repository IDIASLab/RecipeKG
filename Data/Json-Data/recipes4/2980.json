The only change I made was to microwave the chicken breasts rather than bake as per the instructions. Next time I will just chop the sun dried tomatoes and add them to the sauce without prior cooking. I will also try it without the italian seasoning and add some chili flakes. I served this with tricolor elbow pasta. Thanks for sharing.",

Once the sauce was done I added it to the pan the chicken was cooked in and covered with foil and baked for 20 min more then uncovered and let sit in the still hot oven for 20 min more. I served over angel hair pasta! I also used cream of mushroom soup since I didn't have cream of chicken. I used the evaporated milk and 1% milk equally. This was yummy!",
