A couple of tips, don't over fill or your dumplings will be hard to fold and will pop open when you cook them.  Wet your fingers while folding and pinching shut - if any of them appear to be coming apart  just wet your fingers and pinch them shut.  These are great to make ahead and freeze.  Great for last minute company or a quick and tasty dinner.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  It's a Keeper!  Update:  Chinese Chives are longer and thicker than regular chives.  If you can't find Chinese chives just use regular chives or garlic chives.",

I minced mushrooms, broccoli, and green cabbage, and added that to the pork mixture! Makes for an even more scrumptious filling and doesn't take much extra time!\n\nI would also recommend re-frying the potstickers again after you add the water, in order to make each side crispy! The wrapping then becomes brown and crisp and the inside extraordinarily juicy. :)",

I used regular fresh chives (couldn't find Chinese chives), and also, could not find dumpling wrappers anywhere, so I used wonton wrappers that I cut into circles...worked like a charm! While these are a bit time consuming, they are super simple and soooo worth it. The sauce is great, but next time I would cut back on the sesame seeds a bit, as I felt there were too many. I will def be making these again...I'm so excited that I made one of my favorite Chinese foods @ home, and they were better than the restaurant~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

This might be because the wrappers we had were square instead of circular. The cooking instructions also will not work unless you have a higher temperature flame and make the dumplings so they are flat on both sides. Adding in a cup of water at medium-high heat for only 2 minutes does not evaporate and leaves the dumplings with a beautiful color but a soggy mess. The filling has a nice flavor but the dipping sauce isn't the best. I'd rather have these with some vinegar and/or hot sauce. Recommended cooking: 2-3 minutes frying on each side and 1 minute steaming with scant 1/4 cup water.",

I had roasted garlic rice vinegar so I used that.  Once I got the hang of making the dumplings it went relatively quickly.  I found that the water did not completely steam out and so I drained it at the end and pan fried a little to crisp up again.  Still a pretty quick process.  The dipping sauce is good, but I think I am going to look at tweeking it or maybe find another one to try.  I am used to a bit sweeter sauce with some other flavors.  The filling was a lot for just the two of us, so I froze it and plan to defrost and make dumplings in the future.  Not sure how it will defrost, so hopefully it will work out.  Will definitely make again.  Great recipe!",
