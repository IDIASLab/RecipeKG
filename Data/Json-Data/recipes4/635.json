I made these for my husband for our 1st wedding anniversary and put them tucked inside a cookie box with tissue paper and a note since for the first anniversary the theme is paper.  I hope he enjoys these.  I snuck a couple and they taste like something out of a bakery!  I cut the recipe in half and used almond extract instead of coconut.  I also used walnuts instead of pecans.  For the chips I used dark chocolate then melted the rest to do various decorations that you'll see in my picture.  Fabulous recipe that I'll definitely do again at Christmas to give to neighbors and relatives.",

I didn't have vanilla or coconut extracts so I used a carob and orange liqueur I had bought while on holiday (3 tsps) cinnamon (1 tsp) and cocoa (1 tbsp). The toasted pecans were so tasty I added a few extra and I didn't have chocolate chips so I broke up a slab of lindt dark chocolate that had nuts and maybe bits of peel (?) in it as well. I also used brown sugar as I didn't have confectioners sugar. The result was fantastic. Really really tasty. My only regret is that I had scaled down the recipe so much as they didn't last long! I think I will make a Christmas version later on with orange essence and spices.",
