It takes 30 minutes to get the leaves off but its well worth it. There is 1.3 oz of scrap and  16 oz of sprouts left for another recipe. I use less oil but otherwise make one tray of chips as listed and another tray without the peppers but with extra salt for those who don't want the spiciness. For the crushed pepper batch, I use one packet of red peppers from a pizza place. I keep extras just for this. Great recipe.",
