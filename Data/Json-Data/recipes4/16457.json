The amount of water sounds small, but it's genuinely all you need for this stew-y dish; if you like a more soupy texture I recommend waiting until the end of cooking since the cabbage will sneakily release a lot of liquid. 2. It seems a little under spiced to me as written so I tend to add a bit extra of everything. 3. The recipe can easily handle less oil--it worked great recently with just a tbsp (it's not QUITE as deliciously rich that way, but it does work). 4. It tastes better the longer the leftovers mingle in the fridge, so I always make a big batch!",
