Brushed some with garlic butter some with just butter. I think my cornbread needed to dry out more as it took 20 minutes just on one side to crisp and brown then 5 more minutes on the other side. Or maybe I was a little heavy handed with the butter brushing! It is delightful and it is a perfect use for leftover stale cornbread. Thanks HotGrandma!",
