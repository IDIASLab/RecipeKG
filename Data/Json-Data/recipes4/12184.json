When you stir all the pistachios and cherries into the chocolate, you lose the red and green color and it all turns out like a lumpy, off-white mixture.  Next time I would pour the chocolate into the pan by itself and then sprinkle the nuts and cherries over the top.  That way it would be red, green, and white - perfect Christmas colors!  It was absolutely delicious, by the way.  I'm still eating it now!",

I lined my pan with foil and sprayed it with cooking spray then put a thin layer of melted white cocolate on it. I sprinkled most of the pistachios and cherry-flavored Craisins on that (I already had them) then drizzled the rest of the white chocolate over it. Then I took the remaining pistachios and fruit and sprinkled it on top pressing it down lightly. After it was firm I just lifted it out of the pan peeled away the foil and gently broke it into small wedge-shaped pieces. It looked beautiful stacked with the fudge and other candies in little clear bags decorated with snowflakes and a red ribbon. Thanks for the recipe!",
