I also didn't care for the butter flavor, but I usually use olive oil. Broiling caused a lot of smoke, and the end result wasn't worth the trouble. This is a good recipe to tweak, though,  so the next time I made it, I replace the butter with olive oil and mixed it with double the amount of garlic cloves (crushed). I then pounded the breasts to a uniform thickness and marinated them in the oil and garlic mixture for 30 minutes at room temp. I then used fresh herbs but doubled the amount except for the rosemary (used recipes's original amount as I'm not a big fan of rosemary) and added that to the chicken marinade and mixed well. I wrapped the chicken in aluminum foil and baked at 350 for 20 minutes, then opened the foil and broiled on high (my oven doesn't have broil temps, just high or low) with chicken on top rack to add some color. I then squeezed fresh lemon juice over the chicken just before serving. With my changes, I would give this five stars. The chicken was VERY juicy, and almost fall-apart tender. The lemon juice \"brightens\" the flavor. Garlic is a great tenderizer, and the marinating really gives it time to work, resulting in juicier, more tender chicken. ",

The taste was incredible and it was so very easy and fast to make! This will definately become a regular in my house.",

If you top the whole thing with a tad of olive oil and a couple drops of worchestershire, the onions will caramelize and will also let their juices soak into the chicken.  Comes out awesome!  ",

Remove from the oven and cover chicken still on broiler pan with aluminum foil for about 10 minutes and serve - you should have one of the most moist and delicious chicken dishes you've ever tasted. The water in the bottom of the pan serves two purposes - one: it will decrease the chances of a grease fire in your oven and two: it evaporates ensuring an extremely moist piece of chicken. The skin gets nice and crispy - I don't eat it but my kids can't wait to get their \"crispy\" - I have also made this with boneless breasts - but my kids prefer the ones with skin. This is an excellent way to cook chicken and the left overs make a delicious chicken salad. The house smells so good when you bake this chicken!!",
