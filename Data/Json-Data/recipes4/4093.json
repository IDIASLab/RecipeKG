I do use my chocolate of choice, but have to say that I love mixing white chocolate with dark chocolate, as it gives the chocolate a lighter appearance and a very creamy consistancy, which is delicious. I usually use nuts, and whatever else I may have lurking around in the pantry (the possibilities are endless), and spoon them into small candy cups for a prettier presentation. I do like to use this method with the crockpot, because it melts the chocolate nice and slow and evenly, but if I'm short on time (which is usually the case, lol) I'll just use the microwave and get the same result (just be careful not to overheat the chocolate). This also makes a great project to do with the kids! :)",

I looked forward to this every year as it was one of my favorite \"candies\". It may not look appealing but it's darn tasty and a heck of a lot cheaper than those expensive peanut clusters that you can get from fancy chocolate sellers. GREAT fun to make with little hands and tints well with food dyes for any holiday you'd like to make these to share. NOTE: You can speed up the process by melting the chocolate in the microwave stirring every 40 seconds until it's the consistancy you need. Then add the peanuts and spoon out by tablespoons onto your waxed paper. It goes much quicker that way.",
