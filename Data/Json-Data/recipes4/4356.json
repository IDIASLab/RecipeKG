Put it in a small jar and refrigerate. This is called chipotle paste. You can add a teaspoon or so to any recipe to add that smokey taste. I use it in my chicken broth for soups, cook chicken tenders in a mixture of cream cheese and chipotle in my small crockpot, add some to ketchup or your favorite BBQ sauce, make a Denver omelette and add a little before cooking. The possibilities are endless and chipotle paste is a little addictive!",

You may want to sub part of the chipotle/adobo with smoked paprika to keep the smoky flavor without quite so much \"yowza!\". Another cool trick for this meatloaf, if youre feeling whiny like I was, is to throw all the ingredients except the meat and oatmeal in the blender, then mix everything together in a stand mixer. No chipotle-onion-meat-hands! Thanks so much for the recipe! (I doubled it - we're getting down with sandwiches tomorrow for lunch!)",

I would highly recommend this recipe and to follow it as-directed! I was skeptical about the oats because I had never used them in meatloaf before (though it may be somewhat common) but I was glad I did; the mixture was really wet but the loaf came out perfectly. Maybe add one extra chipotle pepper if you want some heat; I typically like spicier food but the extra would have taken away from it in my opinion. As I said a nice twist on meatloaf! I served it with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.",

I used three chipotle peppers instead of two and I also added some spinch just to fit in an extra veggie. Otherwise I followed the ingredients and directions exactly and I am blown-away. The spice hits you after your first bite and it truly is a deep smokey spice. I brought a slice of leftovers to my friend's house and both her and her roommate demanded I show them where to find the recipe. I also think this would be delicious with ground turkey which I may try next time for a slightly healthier alternative. And if anyone is having a hard time finding the peppers (I sure did!) head for a store with a large Mexican-food section. I traveled to three stores before finally finding them at Walmart.",

I also used a tangy BBQ sauce versus sweet. For baking it I lined a baking sheet with foil and put the entire loaf pan on it and happy I did because it did splatter a bit. I also used a meat thermometer and baked to 157 degrees and it raised to 161 when it came out of the oven. Perfect but took longer than an hour. Definitely let it rest for about 10-15 minutes so that it's not falling apart when you cut into it. Next time I plan to use a muffin pan so that there's more crunchy stuff along the sides and won't take as long to bake. Using the leaner meat (93%) I recalculated the calories to be 237 per serving 9.9 g fat (3.4 sat) 10.4 g carb 1.2 g fiber 25.4 g protein.",

I used celery seed watered down adobo sauce breadcrumbs chicken 'n rib bbq sauce and cleaned the pepper really well. I made only half of the recipe. It was super spicy even for me and I like some heat! Not something I'll make again though. Thanks for the recipe nonetheless!",
