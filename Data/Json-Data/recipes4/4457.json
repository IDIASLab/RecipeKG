One I have done is mixing seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. I have also made it as is but subtituted french fried onions for the onion soup mix. I think the key is more likely the mayonaise that keeps the chicken tender. I also flatten the chicken slightly so it cooks evenly. Only downside is that there is no sauce or gravy. EDIT NOTE: I made again today on the stove and it was even more \"tender\" and much quicker than baking. I used chicken tenderloins. I didn't have any more mayo so I used a mock buttermilk and let soak for 30 minutes. I then mixed the 1st two ingredients to taste using plain bread crumbs. I heated about 2 tablespoons of butter in a saute pan on medium and cooked on both sides for about 7-8 minutes total. I served this time like a chicken tender with Honey Mustard Dressing II also from the site.",

Both turned out well. I love how easy it is. Takes but a few minutes to coat the chicken then you forget about it for the next 45 minutes or so while you make some side dishes. I forgot to add that I used regular breadcrumbs because that's all I had. I'm going to make this often.Thanks for a great quick recipe.",

I coated the chicken with the mix and refrigerated for one hour so the breading would stay on the chicken. Don't cut into the chicken if you can help it as the juices will cause the breading to become soggy and fall off. I also used Miracle Whip spread on with a knife as it is what we had and it was just fine",
