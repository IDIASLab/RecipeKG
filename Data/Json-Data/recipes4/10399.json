Then I added in the flours and the salt and mixed for a few minutes then kneaded it by hand for a few minutes.  I let it rest for about an hour, punched it down and put it in a bread pan and let it rise for another 45 minutes.  After that I baked it at 375 degrees for about 30-35 minutes.  The bread had a wonderful subtle honey taste... would be good with some honey butter.",
