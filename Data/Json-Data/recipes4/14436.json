I sauteed the sprouts after cooking, per another reviewer's suggestion, which was well worth it. Also added a large garlic clove & some chopped sweet onion. I didn't use a whole teaspoon of salt , just a pinch during the saute. It was very vinegary IMO, & I think maybe it'll mellow the next day. Thanks anyway.",
