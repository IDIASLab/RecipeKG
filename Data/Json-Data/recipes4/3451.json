But I am so glad I did. The flavours were wonderfully fragrant while it simmered and the taste all the flavours complimented each other perfectly! I did leave out the paprika cause I had none but added some cayenne pepper instead. I also brushed my phyllo dough with melted butter cause I didn't have cooking spray. So it had a buttery flavour to it as well. I probably used double the amount of filling in my cigars but that's just personal preference. I did not dip these in anything I ate them plain. They would make impressive appetizers at parties or just great for snacking on as a finger food. Thanks for sharing!",
