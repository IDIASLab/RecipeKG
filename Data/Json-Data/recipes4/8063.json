I am not a chorizo fan so I made an 8 x 8 pan using chorizo and an 8 x 8 pan using hot breakfast sausage instead. It did seem that the casserole could use some extra filling so I added a little extra sausage onion & peppers. I also added some salt & pepper to the mix. I might make this again but I would add some garlic powder & cayenne to the potato onion pepper mixture when I sauteed it to add some more flavor.",
