The taste and texture is wonderful, never picked up a knife because they were still tender. I did use thinner breasts, not too thick. I didn't have fresh basil so I used about a 1/2 inch squeeze of basil puree from a bottle. (usually right next to the fresh herbs in the supermarket) I spread it on the breasts right before adding the mozzarella and tomatoes. Make sure you use FRESH mozzarella people! MY 14 y.o. daughter, who doesn't like fresh tomatoes, gobbled it up and asked if there was anymore! The rest of the crowd said, \"make more next time!\" And it LOOKS so gourmet too. This is a keeper!",

I browned the chicken in my skillet but instead of discarding the marinade I poured it back in before it went in the oven. I cooked on 500 for 15 minutes. It was DELICIOUS!!!! I quartered grape tomatoes and sauteed them super quick in a frying pan with a little bit of balsamic vinegar salt and pepper and chopped basil and topped it with parmesan cheese. We put it on pasta so I'm glad I had the extra marinade it turned into a sauce. Then the tomato mixture - (skipped the mozzarella). AMAZING and very low cal the way I made it!",

I skipped the chicken seasoning because I felt there would be enough flavor from the Italian dressing and seasoning. The chicken was grilled on the BBQ using wood chips which added flavor. I added the mozzarella and tomato at the end and put the grill lid down to allow the cheese to melt which saved a dirty pan. I cut my fresh basil into a chiffonade because a whole leaf can be overwhelming as well as more difficult to eat. Since the breasts were large I sliced them horizontally. We liked the thinner chicken and it cooked quicker. My family raved about this recipe asking me to \"star\" it so I can make it again. Thanks for a fantastic recipe.",
