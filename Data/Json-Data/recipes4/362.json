I use either mac or egg noodles depending on what i have and it works great either way i use about 1/4 of the can of milk and 2 cans of tuna. Also i season it with garlic and italian seasoning. Also since i usually have no croutons I use italian breadcrumbs and of course tons of cheese. Also I throw in frozen veggies when i cook the pasta and mix them in too. Yum:D",
