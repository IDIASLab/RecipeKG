This recipe had such a lack of balance that it was impossible to correct.  The sourness of the tamarind paste was so prominent that it dominated the recipe.  I tried to balance it with sugar, but it still wouldn't work.  The only things that allowed me to choke it down (I refuse to throw away meat or fish unless absolutely necessary) was an massive amount of lime mango pickle and a ton of fresh curry leaves.",
