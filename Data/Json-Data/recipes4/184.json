The kids could help themselves and throw away the wrap when they were done.  I mixed the shredded cheese with the noodles and soup to make it extra cheesy, I used 1 tlbsp salt when stirring it up.  I put sprinkle of cheese and pinch of bread crumbs on top of each \"cupcake\".  They were soooo cheesey and were gone instantly!  Thanks for the great receipe.  It's definately a keeper in my house!

Much better and infinitely easier just to make your own white sauce and add grated/shredded cheese plus seasonings you like, stirring until cheese melts, then combining with the elbows.
