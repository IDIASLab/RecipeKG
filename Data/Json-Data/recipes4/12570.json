I mixed the rice tofu mix and marinara sauce together and then put it into the peppers and topped with cheese. There was lots of filling probably twice as much as I needed - maybe my peppers were too small. Made a great vegetable side dish that I served with baked salmon fillets.",

Cooked the tofu with chopped onions instead (no garlic on hand- 1st time ever I swear!)It looked beautiful and with a simple salad it was a very filling meal. I'd like to try this with couscous next time. Oh of course the meat preferring hubby liked it too But then he's just cool like that.",
