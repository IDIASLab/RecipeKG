We also cooked the quinoa, let it cool, then added remaining the ingredients (pre-chilled the fruit) and served it as a cold side dish.  Very refreshing with just the right amount of kick from the hot mango chutney. Party guests ate it all...sorry we didn't have any leftovers for ourselves.  Serving cold adds time to the recipe, but you could make the quinoa ahead of time and then put the entire dish together when ready to serve.",
