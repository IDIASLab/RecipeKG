In fact I'd have given it \"3\" stars for \"ok\" but Mr. LTH (unsolicitedly) commented he enjoyed it so that bumps it up to \"4\". To me it was kind of bland. It had a nice earthy flavor but still a bit bland; I found myself really enjoying the bites w/the fresh parm I'd added to the top. I couldn't get the mushrooms/onions/garlic to puree in my blender w/out adding some liquid so I added some of the pasta water. THANKS for the recipe evilcookie007!",
