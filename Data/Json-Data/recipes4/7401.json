I actually toasted my bread in the toaster first then buttered it and sprinkled on garlic powder to taste. Then I built the sandwich on top of the garlic sides then buttered the outside and finished it off on the griddle. So it was twice-toasted making the sandwich extra crispy and extra good! I used provolone slices and freshly grated Parmesan but I think it would also be amazing with fresh mozzarella. I also chopped up the spaghetti into more bite size pieces before putting it on the sandwich. And I used bolognese or meat sauce. Oh and unless you like cold spaghetti straight from the fridge be sure to heat it up first. My first attempt yielded a hot crispy sandwich with melted cheese but a cold filling. It is SO much better with hot spaghetti. Once you try this you may find yourself doubling your spaghetti recipe just to make sure you have plenty of leftovers!:-)",
