I couldn't find one, so I submitted my own. This is an easy, basic lima bean dish with ham, onion, and seasonings. Served over Mexican cornbread, it makes a delicious hearty meal. You can also do this on the stovetop. Just follow the directions on the back of the lima bean bag and add the seasonings. Slow cooker time is about 7 hours. Add a side salad for a complete meal.",

If I use bacon, I add in the bacon drippings, too. I also use half chicken broth and half water when simmering. You can also do this on the stovetop. Just be careful and don't let the beans scorch.",
