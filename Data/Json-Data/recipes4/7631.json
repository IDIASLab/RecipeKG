                "reviewBody": "I love stuffed peppers, but most recipes have the usual rice/meat/tomato combo. This is a nice change! I love that it's lower carb too! One pepper is very filling, and healthy! I would suggest doubling the frozen onion/pepper mix and goat cheese. It will appear that you have way too much kale filling, but really pack it into the peppers as it will shrink while cooking. I cooked mine for exactly 30 mins and the peppers came out perfectly for me - cooked, but still slightly firm so they kept their shape. I think it's important to cover the peppers with foil while they're baking. I had mine uncovered for the first 10 minutes and the top layer of kale filling was drying out and turning into a dry kale chip texture. I finished them off with foil. I used a full slice of Havarti on each pepper. Once back in the oven, the cheese will take less than a minute to melt. I'll be making these again with the slight tweaks I noted.  These would look lovely using red peppers. A great way to use up leftover chicken! Delicious!",

I saut\u00e9ed purple kale for a bit with olive oil and the rest of the seasonings. I also used parmesan cheese instead of goat cheese (which is shockingly expensive). I used quite a bit more parmesan than the recipe calls for on goat cheese. It was fantastic and a huge hit. Paired with a side of basal spinach pesto pasta.",
