They can be served in chicken soup (similar to won ton soup) or fried and served as a side dish. This recipe is for ground beef kreplach but you could also use chicken or other vegetables to make a vegetarian version. If you prefer, you may leave the cinnamon and walnuts out of this recipe.",

It says to form a ball with the dough...well it was pretty difficult to form a ball when the dough was more like a batter consistency and very drippy. I had to add 2 more cups of flour.
