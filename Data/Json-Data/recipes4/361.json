I've tried a pot roast cooked in a similar fashion and loved it so I thought I would give this a whirl. Since it is just me I cooked one pork chop with 1/2 can of soup. I seasoned with rosemary and onion flakes plus salt. I found the pork chop moist and flavorful. This recipe is a keeper for me! It's easy to throw in the oven after work while I take the dogs for a walk. Thanks!",

The sauce however left something to be desired. I m just not sure what that something is. It s a trifle.. well it s not bland. I just don t know what it is. The dish didn t get past the mushroom soup-beefy onion soup gaahhhrlic - oniony-ness that seemed to overpower the pork. That s probably my fault since I strayed from the recipe. But my family and I including my picky daughter ate it up. But when it came to left overs I couldn t make myself eat it for a day or two. And then I was staaarrving for protein and all of a sudden there was a ton of pork left over that was just begging to be consumed. This recipe isn t one I d purposefully set out to make ever again. It s not for dinner parties. But if it s the end of the month and money is scarce and the ingredients are something you ve got in your pantry (and let s face it most of us do) it s some good eating.",

I seasoned my chops well and browned them, placed in bottom of slow cooker, mixed 1 can cream of mushroom, minced garlic, 1/2 an envelope of dried onion soup mix, about 1/4 c white wine, and 1 can of mushrooms. Then poured over the chops. I cooked this on low 6 hours and it was perfect. Finished it off with a little sour cream to help cut the salt. Served with pasta. Definitely not gourmet but a good pantry/ freezer meal when you don't feel much like cooking and are low on groceries.",
