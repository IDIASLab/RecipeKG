The confectioner sugar blended beautifully but gives the lemonade a chemical sweetness that I wasn't crazy about.  The mint is a nice pop of flavour - since some people don't like mint in their lemonade I offered the chopped mint on the side.  Good lemonade, but I think I'll use a simple syrup next time.",
