Plus the Cream of Chicken.  The recipe did not call for salt and I did not add any due to the salt in the 3 cans of soup.  I let it cook about 45 minutes and the biscuits were perfect!   \n I watched to make sure biscuit tops did not burn since this was my first attempt to make it.    Highly recommend you  try this one.",
