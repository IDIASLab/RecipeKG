I liked that this used low fat milk (I only had 2% on hand so that's what I used)...it made me feel like it was healthier lol. In my opinion this would be better suited as a side dish than a main course but again that's just my opinion. I do think it would go great alongside a nice steak or shrimp. I was glad to try this for something different! Thanks for sharing.:)",
