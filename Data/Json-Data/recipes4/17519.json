I don't like food waste so I took the zucchini that was scraped out and chopped it up and added it back to saute with the onions and garlic. This created enough moisture that I was able to omit the chicken stock. Note: there are no spices in this recipe. The spice of the chorizo does carry pretty far but not far enough. I added salt and pepper to the mixture before stuffing the squash. In the furture I will layer in some other spices possibly smoked paprika cumin or even oregano. Also mine needed to bake much longer than 5 min. It took about 20 min to get the cheese melted and bubbly. Family loved it and I will definitely make this again.",
