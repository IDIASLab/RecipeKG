SO, I decided to mix the ranch dressing (I eyeballed it, probably about 3/4 a cup) and the cheese, dip the chicken in that and then dredge in the bread crumbs.  I only had the Italian seasoned bread crumbs, but I didn't think it mattered too much.  My son, who can be picky about meat sometimes, LOVED this!  It's a winner and will make again!  Thanks for a great, and easy recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "We liked the flavor in this crispy baked chicken.  I think its flavor would appeal to a lot of people and I could see where it would be popular at a pot luck.  I used dry panko bread crumbs because they make it really crispy.  I used a combination of shredded Monterey Jack and Cheddar because that is what I had on hand.   The package of shredded cheese had the two mixed together.   I did not have a package of the ranch dressing mix so I made some using Scotdog's Dry Buttermilk Ranch Mix recipe from this site.   On the first couple of pieces of chicken the breading was not sticking to the chicken as well as I liked so I stirred an egg into the milk and that helped the breading stick a little better.  I placed the chicken on a baking rack inside a baking dish to keep the bottom of the chicken crispy.   I sprayed the chicken with cooking spray and then put it in the oven.  I can't say the exact time as the power went out during a thunderstorm while it was in the oven.  So it took longer than usual.  The end result was a delicious flavorful crispy chicken.  As I like spicy foods, next time I might use pepper jack cheese or add a little cayenne to give it a little heat.  Thanks Joanne for a new recipe to try.",

I did sprinkle some garlic salt on the chicken breast before because I was thinking it might be low on salt with just the breading. It added a nice garlic flavor to it. Just use a little so it doesn't become too salty. I also used buttermilk instead of milk because it is what I had on hand. The buttermilk adds to the ranch flavor. Yum!",
