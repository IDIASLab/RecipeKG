The only changes I made were to use maple syrup in place of honey and more butter in place of coconut oil. It takes about 70 minutes total in my oven and I judge doneness by using an instant read thermometer to test when it reaches 190 degrees F. This bread is moist and delicious and is now in my regular rotation of healthier snacks for the kids. Great recipe!",

I didn't care for walnuts in this so I will not use them again. I did add 1/2 c. coconut which I will do again. My mistakes include substituting baking powder (because I didn't think my baking soda as fizzy enough in the pretest) without adding an acid/lemon/vinegar to make up for the switch and forgetting my melted oil and butter until the end. While it passed the tooth pick test the loaf was dense and didn't raise as much as I would have liked. Seeing though that I think this is a great recipe and I will make it again (properly) because it really is a healthier route to a great taste. thanks for a great recipe.",
