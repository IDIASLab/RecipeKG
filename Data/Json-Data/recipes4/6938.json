The one thing that I didn't like was that the sour cream totally liquified once combined with the meat. The dish had zero eye appeal because of the watery texture. The Greek seasoning was a nice addition but overall this stroganoff was a disappointment. In all fairness it could be that I wouldn't like any ground beef stroganoff so moving forward I'll stick with the real deal version. Sorry olderguy for the less than favorable review.",
