I used the deli thin sliced corned beef and shredded my own Swiss. I also used radiatore pasta just because I like the way it looks. I started out using the recommended amount of dressing but it definitely needed more so I doubled it and by the time it was served the dressing all but disappeared. I seems it was soaked up by the pasta but the flavor was gone. I'd suggest waiting until the last minute before serving it to keep the dressing on the pasta instead of soaked up in it.",
