I thought I would really like the crescent dough version but I actually think I like the flaky biscuit dough flavor and texture better. It probably doesn\u2019t matter to a bunch of guys watching a football game though. I do admit I did use store brand crescent dough. Maybe that made a difference. For those who are confused about how to get the triangles to work here\u2019s the technique; The crescent dough is basically a rectangle cut into large triangles with diagonal cuts from corner to corner of the rectangles. This makes the large triangles, in truth, 90-degree triangles with points off to one side. To make 4 small triangles out of each large crescent roll, 90 degree triangle, for the little cocktail size sausages: Lay one of the (8) large triangles out flat with the point pointing at you and the square corner on the left. About 1/3 of the way down cut the point off the triangle making 1 of the 4 small triangles. (Set that one aside or immediately roll it around a sausage.) You now have sort of a lopsided rectangle with 1 square corner (on the left) and one corner sticking out at an angle (on the right).  From the bottom edge (farthest away from you) move your knife leftward from the angled corner, on the right, about 1/3 of the length of that bottom edge. Make a diagonal cut to the upper (closest to you now) right-hand edge corner, where you cut the first small triangle off. You now hav",

The way I make mine is to take each crescent rectangle, cut another diagonal, then straight down the middle and across like a + sign. If you do it for each rectangle it will give you enough to wrap 32.  I also brush with egg to give it a rich golden color and they come out beautiful.  My kids love them especially with the little cheddar smokies.",
