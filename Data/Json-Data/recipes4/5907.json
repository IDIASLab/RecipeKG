Only adjustments I made were omitting the garlic (my family does not care for garlic) and using pre-cut chicken tenderloin strips (you can see from the pic they were about 2 inches wide x 3.5 inches long) which made the cooking time slightly longer (but only like a minute or so). My hubby and kids were begging for seconds and bc I doubled the recipe (we have a large family), they were so excited to have the leftovers the following night! The only criticism I would make is marinading it in the bbq/Worcestershire mix for an hour or so before cooking (which really isn't a criticism bc I haven't tried it and don't know if would REALLY make a difference). However, it would obviously extend the prep time...and not make it a \"quick\" dinner but might meld the flavors slightly better. I will try it next time (and there will be a next time) and update my review (or maybe someone else will try the marinade step and post the findings in the meantime). This aside, it still gets 5 stars for being fantastic. We served this with mashed potatoes (pre-made refrigerated kind) and steamed green beans. Thanks \"Aaron\" for a great and fast dinner!",

What a perfect way to \"jazz\" up bottled barbecue sauce (because basically that is what you are doing). Much better than just the barbecue sauce. I also added about a 1 1/2 tablespoons of honey. Once I heated everything up, I poured it over the chicken and baked it (covered) at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes. This is very very good. I will be making this again",
