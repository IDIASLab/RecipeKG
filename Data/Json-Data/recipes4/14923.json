I wound up adding a little bit of sugar and lemon to the dressing and threw in some bleu cheese (and chicken for my Dad) at the end but overall I thought this was very good. I wasn't quite sure how the salad was supposed to look so I made it sliced per the description took a photo then chopped up the rest and made it like a regular Waldorf. See both photos and make it your own way! Either way this was a good salad and more filling than you would think.",
