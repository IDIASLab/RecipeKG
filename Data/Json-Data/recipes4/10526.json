I am going to try adding the seasoning to the actual bread rather than on top. I would suggest maybe substituting Italian seasoning for the basil and thyme. Rather than greasing up a pan try throwing down some corn meal. This recipe seems to work well with fresh veggie's on top as well (try adding sliced onions and mozzarella over the top!)",

I however do think I will try it again as it has the potential to be great with a little work. First 1 tablespoon of sea salt on the top is WAY too much. I would cut this dramatically. Second I purchased a new non-stick cookie sheet to make this. I feat part of the problem may have been my pan as everything I have cooked on it to date has come out overdone or burnt on the bottom. The final issue I had was the bread itself was dry. I think part of this may have been due to the cookie sheet. The top of the bread after you knocked most of the salt off did have good flavor though. I will make this again as I have tomatoes left over I need to use. I am hoping once I make a second attempt I can work the kinks out.",
