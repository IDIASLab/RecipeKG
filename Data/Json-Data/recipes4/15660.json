I made the cake as directed - The only exception was I folded in the contents of 2 single serve Snack Pack Vanilla Pudding cups to  the filling.  It gave it a little substance (in fact, next time I will fold in 3 pudding cups).  I did not add pudding to the portion set aside for the topping.  My father in law like it so much he requested it for his birthday in a few weeks.   \nWill also try a chocolate version as well.",
