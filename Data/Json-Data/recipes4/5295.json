If your potato is too big, you'll end up using so much confectioner's sugar.  I know it takes a whole box usually, but instead of measuring it out, I just keep mixing a little more in at a time until I achieve the dough.  You absolutely have to be a little flexible with this, and not get hung up on exact measurement with the sugar.  Just add it gradually. I agree that it is very sweet, that's why I like to use chunky peanut butter, and maybe sprinkle in a dash of sea salt on finished pieces for that salty/sweet taste.",
