I marinated the meat for 24 hours and then grilled it nice and slow.  It couldn't have been better!  The meat was tender and absolutely perfect.",

Marinaded chicken tenders for about 8-9 hours - was plenty of time.  I used my new grill pan skillet and grilled the chicken in just a tiny bit of the marinade.  When that was done, I took them out, put a little more marinade in the pan, and grilled a large sliced onion and both a red and green bell pepper, cut into strips.  Added a little more olive oil and cajun spice while the veggies gooked.  Best fajita meal ever!",

I swapped out the soy sauce for Lea & Perrin's doubled the cayenne added half a teaspoon of cumin and a few jalapeno slices. I also left out the salt. I was expecting this to be a little spicier than it was but the flavor was great. I was worried my mom would think it was too spicy but surprisingly not (my dad and brother liked it too so the heat level must have been just right to please everybody). If I were making this recipe for myself I'd probably add even more cayenne but then I am pretty crazy. The only complaint I have (and not enough to bump it down to 4 stars) is that prep time for me was a lot longer than 15 minutes. I guess if you start with your limes already squeezed (or juice from a bottle) and your chicken already cut up and stuff it might take 15 minutes but if you have to take those into account it'll probably take a little longer. Or I could just be slow since it took me around an hour.;) I'll have to do this with steak next time. I made two pounds of chicken and usually when we have fajitas there's chicken left over the next day. Not this time! Too bad because I was looking forward to quesadillas for lunch tomorrow. Oh well!",

I have to say I HATE trying new recipes when we have parties but I bit the bullet on this one and it turned out WONDERFUL!  We got so many rave reviews and my husband has been begging me every weekend to make more fajitas.  The only addition I made in the recipe is I added 1/2 c. chopped fresh cilantro cause I love the flavor of it and marinated overnight.  They turned out awesome!!  I thought for sure I would be left with a ton of leftover meat, considering I always over estimate, but we had a small handful left, which my husband nibbled on after the guests all left. I will definately be using this recipe again, my husband wants to laminate the recipe!!!  KUDOS ROBBIE!!",
