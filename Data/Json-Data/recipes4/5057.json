I did a batch of these with three types of onions, and they were wonderful.  Using Vidalia onions was best!  I found that I had to increase the oven temperature to 450 instead of 350 to keep the coating crisp and cook the onion enough, but not so much it becomes mush.  At 350 the batter does stick to the onion better but they are more like 2am diner onion rings than the steakhouse kind you get if you bake in a hotter oven.",

I increased the heat as others suggested and I'm really happy that I did. the onion was perfect and the outer breading crunchy. two things to note- A -the outer breading was really thin.. Delicious but very thin. I think next time I will add more flour to the batter and try to get the breading thicker. B- Definitely NOT a very good recipe for beginners. its also a bit more time consuming than you'd think. if you're looking for a fast easy onion ring I suggest trying a different recipe. But if your willing to get messy put the time in and have some prior knowledge of how breading works this is a fantastic option.",
