My only complaint was not knowing how much salt or cinnamon to use... I had about 2 cups of seeds and I put them on a cookie sheet w/ foil. I didn't use any cooking spray. I sprinkled the enitre amount of seeds with cinnamon and I tried to cover most of the seeds. I was scared about the salt so I sprinkled about a tbs. of sugar over the seeds and than I lightly sprinkled the seeds w/ the salt (probably about a tsp of salt) than I cooked it for 10 mins took it out.. stirred it around in the cookie sheet and put another heavy coating of cinnamon and this time added more salt than I did last time (probably more like a tbs) and I put it back in the oven for 20 more mins. I was surprised at how well the salt and cinnamon tasted w/ the seeds. I'm definatly making these from now on! Thanks Alison!",

I took into account what some other review had said about adding extra cinnamon, so I had done that.  I wanted to add sugar, but was concerned about them sticking together as on review said, so I sprinkled about 1/2 cup of sugar on them immediately after coming out of the oven and stirred quickly until cooled.  Perfect!  Sweet and cinnamon seeds.  I also wouldn't do without the salt, but the original flavor was not for me.",

The cinnamon is not too overpowering and the salt is a good balance for the flavor. They are PERFECT!...at least for me. I'd recommend them to anyone wanting to do something with pumpkin seeds.",
