I prepped them on a sheet of foil & used that to help roll it up; waxed paper would probably have been a better choice although the foil worked well enough. Also a fresh sheet for each roll-up would be good as the foil got rather buttery & the outer sheet of phyllo stuck like a suction cup on the second roll-up.
