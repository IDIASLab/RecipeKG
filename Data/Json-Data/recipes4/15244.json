Next time I may decrease the amount of ground coffee just because that flavor came through a bit strong for me, but it could also be the type of ground coffee I used. Also, with regards to the prep time, this definitely took me more like 45 min to prepare, and this wasn't my first time making bagels.",

My husband has raved about them in New York where he visited a relative for many years. We went there as a family and tasted them when I saw this recipe I tried it straight away. These bagels are exactly what we had in New York a fantastic recipe and it's saves us a lot of money as we were getting them shipped over twice a year from a deli on the lower east side. A recipe well worth the effort double the mix and freeze half no problem. I added a lot more caraway seed because we love the taste of them.",

If you have an efficient oven like I do I would drop the temp to 425 and cook slightly longer (if you have a baking stone that is a definite PLUS. I (personally would add more caraway seeds) I would definitely do a 1 egg and 3 TBSP water egg wash over the bagels after they have dried from the boiling water. The bagel insides were slightly wet in some places but because they were hot they continued to cook during the cooling process so don't be alarmed if they seem a little \"juicy\" in some places. They seemed to be lacking in something taste-wise but I just cannot place what as I have not been to NY in many many many years to have a REAL pumpernickel bagel. They definitely have the denseness of a classic pump bagel which was most certainly a plus. Overall if I can figure out what I am lacking and refine my recipe slightly there is absolutely no reason why these bagels would not deserve 5 stars.",

But I m not sure what they re supposed to taste like because I ve never had one before. I ll try making these again but will probably use less molasses or substitute it altogether with sugar. The flavor of the molasses was a little too strong. Maybe it s just me though since I m not a fan of molasses. Haha. Apologies for multiple uploads of the same photo. I can't figure out how to remove them. The photo didn't show at first do i kept trying to upload.hehe",
