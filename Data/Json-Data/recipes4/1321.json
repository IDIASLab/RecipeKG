Wouldn't have added cilantro even if I'd have had it. We ate these on Italian bread subs and they were Oh-so-yummy! Even better for lunch the next day.

I felt like I was eating the prize winning sausage and pepper on a roll at the state fair.  It's that good.  Only changes were I only had one onion, used parsley instead of cilantro, and more green pepper than red...I used two thirds sweet and one third hot for the sausage.  I did add a bit more paste than what called for as well.  My husband moaned in satisfaction with every bite-I'm not kidding!\nI would suggest using a better grade of sausage-it tends to omit less fat!",

Everyone enjoyed it and next time I'll use beer for sure! Keep in mind that the success of the recipe depends on the quality of sausage you use. If you're lucky enough to live in an area with lots of places that make and sell their own sausage I suggest that you try those varieties over the mass-produced national brands. Some of the national brands have large amounts of salt fat and preservatives and if you can avoid some of that you're ahead of the game!",
