But this recipe is a nice option for a healthy treat. I will say the first time I made them the dough was very dry and I wasn't able to form balls of dough to make the cookies. I figured out that the prunes needed to be blended with hot water to make the puree. In a food processor I mixed 6 ounces of prunes with 6 tablespoons of hot water then used 2 tablespoons of puree in the recipe. I was pretty sure it would be impossible to puree just the 2 tablespoons called for so I didn't try that but the recipe only yeilds about a dozen cookies so you could easily double it to make more use of the puree.",
