Although the recipe calls for 2 tsp. of red pepper flakes, it should have stated 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes. I wouldn't add 2 tsp. unless you want to breathe fire. If you don't like the extra kick of spice, it's fine to leave out the red pepper flakes. Personally, I don't care for overly spicy foods. I really don't like to eat foods that hurt me.",

Even my husband said how spicy it was and he can handle a lot of heat in his food. I adjusted the servings to 8 used crushed red pepper assuming it's the same as red pepper flakes and kept everything else the same. I will definitely try it againP.S. I hated to only give it one star because I'm sure I messed up somewhere but it wouldn't let me post if I didn't rate it.",

It is a little labor intensive and does take nearly two hours, but it is well worth it.  I always read the reviews of recipes on here prior to making them and I am glad I did follow several other reviewers' suggestions to halve the red pepper flakes.  I put in just a teaspoon and it still had plenty of kick.  Next time I will use just a half as my teenager doesn't care for that much spice.  I did marinate the meat in pinot noir for 30 minutes.  Next time I will do at least two hours if not four just to further enhance the flavors.  Honestly, it was 5 stars with just 30 minutes so if that is all the time you have, it still comes out delicious.  Additionally, I will probably simmer it for more than an hour to thicken the sauce or add just a pinch of corn starch at the end as I prefer more of a gravy consistency.  All in all, this recipe is a keeper and can be tweaked for everyone's liking.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.",
