We actually liked it better than my usual spaghetti recipe because the broken noodles were much easier to eat.  I used a can of crushed tomatoes because my oldest son won't eat spaghetti sauce if he can see pieces of tomato.  I added a packet of spaghetti seasoning, fresh basil (had it on hand), and garlic.  This isn't a gourmet recipe, of course, but pretty darn good!",

I added crushed fresh garlic garlic powder extra italian seasoning and crushed red pepper in addition to using whole peeled tomatoes with basil and still found it to be a little under seasoned so I added additional garlic powder at the table. I ended up needing almost 3 cups of water to keep the sauce from being to thick and dry. I will probably make it again because of the ease but the recipe needs modifications to improve the flavor.",
