The flavor wasn't bad it's just that there wasn't much OF IT. Pretty bland even with the garlic addition. I'm also not sure why it calls for water as well as milk. I'd say pick one or the other because I ended up with mushroom a la soup. If I hadn't been so hungry I would have taken a moment to try to thicken it w/ cornstarch or something but I was famished so I ate it as it. Also I don't think I would make this with macaroni. Egg noodles might be a better choice but maybe that's just me. Thanks:)",
