Only used 1/3 cup flour and stirred that into the 1/4 cup butter and stirred until it was a nice golden color. Used 2% milk. This time I used the real velveeta cheese next time I'll try it with the 2% velveeta and I really don't think it will change anything but the calorie count. Also put 4 chicken bouillion cubes and 2 beef boulilion cubes into the broth - think it give it a bit more depth of flavor. Being in Texas I had to add a few sprinkles of crushed red pepper flakes. Great on a cold winter night!",

UPDATE: I made this again and made some additions and substitutions.. MMMmmMMm... yummy. not as thick as I normally like it but deLICious flavor.. the first four ingredients I left alone. I had all of them. And since I didn't have Velveeta cheese (and it's processed. trying to be more healthy;)) I changed the rest of the ingredients to my way of making cheese sauce without it. I used 4 tbs butter 1/4 c flour 1 cup milk and 2 cups of regular shredded cheese. Also when melting the butter I added a little less than half an onion and 1 stalk of celery to saute in butter then did the rest as is.. still such an awesome recipe. I really love this stuff and there's a few ways to do it without ALL the ingredients and its still similar to the original and SO SO mmm mmm good!! hehe.",

My cheese which was a nacho cheese instead of velveeta was frozen as well so I added that in a minute or two after adding the veggies. I had to use a regular mixed veggie blend instead of the broccoli--we don't have broccoli in the house (freezer or otherwise) right now but it worked well. Just maybe made it less of a broccoli soup. I halved the soup and it still made enough to go with our lunch today and for 2 lunches at work for the both of us this week. I'm surprised there's no seasonings anywhere in this recipe; without the nacho cheese I'd definitely be wanting to add some salt pepper and maybe some garlic and onion. For all that though it's an easy quick soup recipe. Thanks for sharing!",
