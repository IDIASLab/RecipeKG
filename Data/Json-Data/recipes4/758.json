Even my husband and kids who are not fans of cabbage tried it (for new Year's day) and they loved it !!!!  I will definitely make it again.",

You can add more veggies and improvise on this recipe easily. A nice variation from coleslaw and mac-n-cheese all at once.",

Should have drained the cabbage better but I didn't know any better. This is a FIVE STAR recipe. It received rave reviews in my house. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

Cabbage was on special this week and I rarely buy it because I boil it and I like it but well it's just plain old cabbage. This recipe was more of a discovery for me that I could actually doll up cabbage. I used 3 cheeses equal parts (about 2oz. each) of Velveeta Sharp Cheddar and Monterey Jack. I had some heavy cream instead of milk and topped it with the crackers. I added a little margarine to the cheese sauce too and melted it all in the microwave. I initially microwaved the cabbage too. Then I baked the assembled casserole in the oven. Easy and the sauce was marvelous. But the concept of any kind of cheese sauce on the cabbage is one I will do over and over. I won't deduct any stars but my version wasn't by any means low-cal.",
