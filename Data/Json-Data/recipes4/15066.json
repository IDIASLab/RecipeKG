The recipe is flavorful and the finished dish was both colorful and delicious! Very versatile - definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing this recipe.",

It was a lazy, Sunday evening, we had freshly cut Trader Joe's vegetables in a convenient refrigerated package, AND also some  frozen packs of brown rice that's great and  microwaves nicely.  \n  The spice  mix was a good start, but I wanted to add more flavor so I used a group of spices in a McCormick Blend \"Chinese Five Spice\", a mix that you could buy or make yourself; it contained anise, cinnamon,star anise,cloves, and ginger, which truly created a more exotic, rich and spicy flavor meaning it was much more flavorful.  Also I used Tamari Soy Sauce, using less soy sauce required and one can play with the amount to use as the label suggests you can use 1/4  the amount when substituting it for regular salt for the same amount of sodium. It's also made with more soybeans than other soy sauces for a richer flavor . I have used it for decades in various things.\n   The flour clumped a lot w/ water and broth added as I mixed it- I ended up straining out the lumps. I would suggest either leave it out all together, and increase the  liquid by mixing water with  broth,(I used vegetable broth), more of the spice mix ,(note-add equal amounts of water with the additional broth),  or perhaps try to create a heated mix with the recipe's ingredients, using warmed olive oil & the flour ,(maybe substitute rice flour whisked into it for gluten-free folks), then slowly add the broth as soon as",
