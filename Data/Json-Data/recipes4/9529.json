I added more salt and turmeric to taste. I also added dried basil and pepper to taste. When it came time to add the tomato paste mixture, I added half of the tomato paste mixture and half Prego. I kept adding Prego when more sauce was needed especially after the pasta was added to the meat mixture. It tasted great!",

I do love turmeric and enjoy the health benefit it offers that said it is not enough to make this a properly seasoned spaghetti. Additionally there is not enough sauce (I doubled the water turmeric and tomato paste). After tasting it I decided to add in the following herbs 1 1/4 tsp Italian seasoning 1/4 tsp crushed rosemary 1/2 tsp garlic salt with 1/4 tsp garlic powder (I like my garlic) the result...much more flavorful spaghetti for a bump to 3.5 stars.",

When i make Chiili I add about a teaspoon of Sugar to cut the slight bitter taste of the tomato paste. So I did the same for this recipe and added it along with the tomato paste and the ground beef mixed.. I also Added fresh Basil - from a plant not in a bottle or already picked -.ground beef used was 80/15. Also added fresh garlic. the addition of the tumeric is wonderful. it really brings all the flavors together. My wife even told that this is by far the best she has had. My compliments to the person who gave this recipe....",
