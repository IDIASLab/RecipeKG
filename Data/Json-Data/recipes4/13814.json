Nice treat in the morning and also a nice after-dinner coffee! I will definitely pick up some coconut milk to try this one again. Thanks for sharing!",

I didn't have a cinnomon stick so i added about 1/2 tsp of ground cinnomon. I think it was a little on the weak side (for cinnomon). I wondered about the 2 whole cloves but went with it anyway. I didn't find them to overpower the flavor. Infact there is a spice flavor but it isn't overwhelming at all. I bearly noticed the pepper (only because I knew to look for it) my husband didn't notice it at all. This is a fun drink I would consider doing again! though I want to do it with whip and cinn on top next time.",
