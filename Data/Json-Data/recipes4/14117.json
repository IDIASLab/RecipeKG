I used cream of mushroom soup and like to add spinach if I have it on hand.  I also use sharp cheddar cheese because I like it better than swiss.  I sautee the onions and add garlic.  In addition, at the end of cooking time, I brown seasoned bread crumbs in butter and put it on top of the casserole after it finished baking.  Yum, yum yum.  I do cover the casserole to prevent it from drying out.",

I didnt add as much swiss cheese as it called for.  I prob only added 1 1/2 cups and I added a few Tbsps. of milk to the soup/sour cream mixture to thin it out a little.  Next time I will saute the onions because they still had a little crunch to them other than that this was sooooo good!  Thanks for the recipe!",

I added enough to make it 'stirable' but not soupy, if that makes sense. This came out great, it was a huge hit with the family!",
