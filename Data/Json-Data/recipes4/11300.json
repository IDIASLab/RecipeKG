Definitely make gravy from the herb-y, flavorful drippings - it completely kicks you-know-what, too.  Can't say enough good things about this one.  I used softened butter, which is tasty and easier to handle, and put most of the mixture under the skin.  My roaster doesn't have a lid, so I tightly covered with foil; it worked just fine.  In other words, you can't go wrong! **Added later: well, I've made this several more times in different ways - In the oven with a turkey bag, in a countertop roaster, all olive oil instead of butter, sprinkling generously with paprika after pouring on the herbs (to enhance browning - but don't baste or the \"fake tan\" will wash off!)... turns out great every time. Made Thanksgiving lunch this year ('07) for 50+ people at work, including this turkey, and it was rave reviews all around! ** Added '08: I've made this about six times now, so I've decided that this is the magic combo: use olive oil as written; use most of the mixture under the skin with just enough outside for pretty; don't use an oven bag; after the herbs are poured on, add a generous coating of Paprika and skip the basting (don't need it anyway!). Cooked again for work - well before noon at least 10 people had walked up to me with shiny fingers and half-full mouths, saying \"that turkey is so GOOOD!\". 'Nuf said. ",

Once firm, I slice it and put the pats under the skin and in the cavity of the bird.  My turkeys were always, always dry before I found this recipe; now they get rave reviews.  It's a keeper!",

Just as others mentioned, you do need to take the solution and put under the skin of the turkey between the skin and the meat - right on top of the meat and the outside of the skin as well. I also doubled the solution as to have more rub for my large turkey. P.S. I added about 3 tbs of butter and mixed into the mixture to give an additional buttery flavor. If you think I'm wrong about this -- let me tell you what a 10 year old told me after eating my turkey *LEFTOVERS* -- \"This turkey is better than my momma's... her's is dry.\"  Isn't that sweet?\r\n\r\nThis is the juciest turkey recipe you will ever try, I promise.  And the flavor is out of this world. \r\n\r\nThank you whoever invented it! It will be my turkey recipe for every Thanksgiving and Christmas from now until eternity!\r\n\r\nBrandy",

I had a 12lb turkey, lightly stuffed w/ italian sausage stuffing, coated in the herb ingredients.. cooked breast side up for 2 hours (covered), then breast down (uncovered) for another 2 hours.  Oh - I used 1/2c olive oil, 1/4c melted butter.  I didn't even baste it once!  Crispy, browned, juicy.  I can't say enough good things!!!  Update:  cooked it again for a \"Trial Run\" dinner.. fantastic.  Followed exactly as I did it last time - just be careful flipping the bird, its hot and if your hands slip, you lose some of the golden skin.  Happy Thanksgiving!",

I have never had moist white meat at anyone else's house so this recipe must be good. I did a 14 pound turkey stuffed with cranberry sausage and apple stuffing from this site. It took only 3 1/2 hours to cook. The only thing I changed was instead of olive oil I melted 1/2 cup of unsalted butter and added all the spices. I used a brush to apply everything as stated. I poured 2 cups of chicken stock into the bottom of the roasting pan. I left the turkey UNCOVERED and basted it every 1/2 hour which gave it a rich brown color. This recipe is a definite keeper.
