I baked 15-20 min, added wine, stirred/turned, which caused the wine to sizzle & boil down almost immediately.   Back for 5-10 min & done.  Gorgeous.

The recent heat had made my beet greens bitter so I just harvested the beet and instead of greens added some freshly picked peas during the last 5 minutes. Very tasty but would only work really well with very fresh peas. I added a small early red onion from the garden with a small Juane onion instead of just one big yellow onion. I would never have thought of this recipe for myself and it is a keeper. The chiogga beets give it a very pleasing visual appearance and mellow sweetness. Definitely will change your mind on what you think of beets!",
