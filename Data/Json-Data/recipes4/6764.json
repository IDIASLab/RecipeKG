                "reviewBody": "Really delicious! They're a bit fluffier than a typical cookie but still tasty. I actually doubled the spices and used my own blend of ginger cloves and allspice. On some of them I drizzled chocolate over the top which was a nice touch but not necessary because they were already really good. Everyone at my coffee and treats get together loved them! I do think that 400 was a bit high for my oven and on my second round I cooked them at 350 for 5 minutes longer. My final comment is that they don't spread or change very much while baking so if you want flatter cookie-looking ones you should shape them yourselves when you put them on the pan.",
