I at least doubled the recipe with 4 lbs of chicken - I never cook small quantities. Still that was just two 9x13 pans worth. I liked the other reviewer's idea about using Cream of Onion soup but I couldn't find any - so I used Cream of Potato (2 cans) mixed with 1 packet of onion soup mix. I omitted the quartered onion and used red potatoes. I'm not sure if something about the original ingredients requires a bunch of cook time but I could never have left my version in the oven for 2 hours!! It was pretty much done after 45 minutes (on 375) but I let it sit in there for about 10 additional minutes in case the piece of chicken and potato I tested were flukes. Anyway it was pretty good probably not a weekly staple or anything but not too difficult for my skill level! Hopefully someday I will find the CoO soup!",

I lined my 7 quart slow cooker with foil sprayed it with cooking spray used SIX peeled taters and added a couple drumsticks that I rolled in the flour and slid under the broiler for a few minutes on each side. I just wanted to make more portions and my hubby loves drumsticks. I lined the lid with foil and am cooking on low. I always broil drumsticks for a bit before slow cooking.
