The presentation was right out any gourmet cook book photo. The taste was out of this world. My brother hates bell peppers and absolutely loved this dish going back for seconds.

                "reviewBody": "Lovely combination of ingredients creating a beautiful sauce. Almost a shame to mix it up with rice and stuff it in a pepper, but I'm not complaining! I added onion and garlic to the vegetable mix for a more classic Bolognese and even tho' I generally prefer bacon over pancetta, in this case I felt it was well worth using the pancetta as it imparts its own, unique flavor - much different from bacon. Having my own marinara on hand that I had put up from my garden was a definite plus. As I always do with stuffed peppers, I parboiled them for a few minutes before I stuffed them and I believe that's a necessary step.  The filling is not enough to fill 6 peppers so plan on making more than the recipe states.  These were pleasant to prepare as well as to eat  - a definitely enjoyable dinner.  All the ingredients meld to create a flavor all its own and each ingredient plays an important role.  Creative and delicious departure from the classic stuffed pepper.",

I made as directed with the only changes being that I used onion instead of celery (didn't have any), added some garlic & didn't slice the peppers in half lengthwise (I took the tops off & gutted out the seeds). I made my own tomato sauce to use in this but I don't think it mattered- we couldn't tell the sauce was homemade with all the ingredients in this recipe. I'll just use jarred sauce next time. I served with polenta although a light salad would make a better side dish. Panna cotta with fresh raspberries on top for dessert (cannoli would also make a fine dessert to go with this). This was a lot of work & took a long time to make but was worth the time & effort. My husband says it gets 10 stars. I highly recommend. Thanks for the recipe.",
