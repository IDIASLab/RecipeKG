I baked my granola at 250 for an hour stirring every 15 minutes. When the granola was crisp I took it out let it cool and then stirred in the cranberries (The reason I did this was because I've never had luck cooking the raisins/cranberries with the granola. For some reason they always turn out burned. Now I just add them after baking). The combination of ingredients in this granola were fantastic--very VERY good.",

I substituted applesauce for the oil and blackstrap molasses for the honey. I also added a mixture of 1 tablespoon flaxseed (ground) and 3 tablespoons of water which acts like an egg to bind the ingredients. I did not have any cranberries so I used raisins and for the nuts i used a mix of almonds pistachios and walnuts. I also added a sprinkle of nutmeg. Delicious nutritious and highly recommended! I will definitely be making this regularly.",
