My methodology was a little different than the recipe: I seared the steaks on both sides, then finished in the oven to medium. When i removed the steaks from the pan, there was lots of yummy brown fond in the bottom of the pan, which I included in the sauce (if you prepare your steaks and sauce in separate cooking vessels, your sauce will suffer for lack of yummy brown bits!). I didn't cook the steaks in the sauce - used only 1/2 cup wine and 1/2 cup stock, let it reduce by half, then removed from heat and swirled in 2 tablespoons butter at the end to give the sauce a little extra rich feel; this also allowed me to omit the cornstarch and still have a nice, rich sauce.",

Wow this is really gonna be good I thought. I added the cornstarch but found it really wasn't necessary; the sauce reduced nicely on its own.
