We thought the corn was overkill and maybe using 1/3 - 1/2 c. frozen corn would've sufficed over an entire 15.25 oz. can. I used an AR chili seasoning blend instead of the overly-sodium-fused store packets but still felt that this chili was lacking a little je ne sais quoi which resulted in me topping mine w/ healthy squirts of Texas Pete cheese cilantro and Fritos.
