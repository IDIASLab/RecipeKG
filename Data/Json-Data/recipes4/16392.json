I just added all the ingredients to the broth once the thighs were done brought to a boil and then simmered. Added the meat back in once it was cooled and shredded. Topped the bowls with cheese cilantro and tortilla strips. I also added a can of sweet corn that I roasted over the stove and it s juice. I did NOT include the juice from the hominy.

I added more smoked paprika, green onion and a few cloves of garlic.  I also added a can of chipotle chilis in adobo sauce, finely chopped.  Then I juiced 2 limes.  I started saut\u00e9ing it, and then added in 4 cans of diced tomatoes with jalapenos.  Added some cumin, and then 2 qt of chicken broth.
