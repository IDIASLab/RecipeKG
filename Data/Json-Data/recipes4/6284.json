Instead of drizzling the chips with oil then the spices I mixed the oil and seasonings together in a small bowl then poured over the uncooked chips in another bowl and stirred until evenly coated before placing them on the baking sheet. Doing this eliminated any possibilities of spice clumping. I baked at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes or so checking every ten minutes to make sure no burning.",
