The only thing I changed was the same as the advise from many others, mushrooms on the bottom of the dish along with an onion.  I went a bit lighter on the garlic but that is a personal choice.  I left the lid on the casserole dish and cooked it for 1.5 hours then, reduced the resultant liquid by half before adding the cream.  Beautiful and thanks.",

I suggest putting the mushrooms on the bottom of the chicken (or saute them separately if you like 'em brown) or you'll be wasting 6.00 worth of prosciutto. Flavor was good though and the sauce was delicious. I reduced drippings & 3/4 cup white wine by half before adding sour cream. Great over angel hair pasta with some fresh lemon juice on top.",

I used chicken cutlets sliced very thin and I lightly browned them in butter before assembling everything because they didnt have the skin like the thighs would have. Because I made this for 16 people I used virginia ham instead of prosciutto just to save on the cost and I didnt want to use bacon because it sounded too rich that way. Everyone loved it I should have made much more it went so fast. I served this with a mushroom and artichoke risotto. Very delicious easy to prepare and tasted like I cooked all day. Thank you.",

They are fatty enough to lend themselves to the well done side and we cook this dish until the prosciutto and chicken skin bind and provide a crispy crust (almost 2 hours with the last half hour at 325 degrees). I also place the schrooms on the bottom and use Chardonnay as the wine type. The extra cooking time reduces the liquid skightly but rather than reducing it further I take out a little of the liquid before I put it in the saucepan and make a slurry with corn starch (heaping TBS)to thicken the cooking juices sour cream wine mixture. I have extra the next day when I serve any leftovers with steamed Jasmine rice.",
