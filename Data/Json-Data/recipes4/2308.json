Chop up some big chunks of: red bell pepper sweet onion mushrooms two zuchinnis. Toss to coat with a few TBSPS of the wet dressing. 3. Pound the chicken breasts and roll them. Secure with toothpicks and drape with bacon. Roll them around in the wet dressing to coat. 4. Line a biggish pan with foil. Arrange the chicken breasts and pour all the veggies in between. 5. Let it sit in the fridge for about 4 hours. 6. Make a foil tent. 7. Bake covered @ 375 for the first 25 minutes uncover for the last 20 minutes (or until chicken is done and veggies are fork tender). About 45-50 minutes. This is yummy. You could probably roll up some nice goat cheese in the chicken if you are cheesy. But it is a pretty good dish. I always add a little extra garlic and a little extra worcestershire and a coupla pinches of sugar to the dressing because I like to tweak things.",

UPDATE: I made it again. This time I upped the mustart to 2 tablespoons and added dry parsley and 1 teaspoon liquid smoke (hickory) to the glaze. Then I baked it on a rack to allow the fat to drain.
