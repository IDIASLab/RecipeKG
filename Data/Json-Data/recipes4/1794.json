After baking in the oven, the rice was still uncooked.  So after baking, I transferred everthing but the pork chops to a sauce pan with with a lid and simmered for about 10-15 minutes.  This cooked the rice.  Then, I put the rice mixture back on the pork chops for serving.  It was very yummy.  Next time, I will simmer the rice mixture on the stove first for about 15 minutes, and then, bake in the oven.",

Added cumin and chili powder and added a can of chicken broth for more liquid. Served it with cheese quesadillas - a fast and very easy weekday meal. I ended up with too much tomato/bean/rice/corn mixture so I froze some for the next time - which will make it even that much faster! Thanks for a great idea!",

I added the remaining half of the taco seasoning and Rice a Roni packet to the tomato/rice mixture while simmering. I served with a tossed salad and cheese quesadillas(thanks to the poster who suggested that - was the perfect addition to this meal). I got many compliments from the family and this was super easy. Thank the Lord because anyone who's ever had a six month old to take care of knows about needing easy dinner solutions!!!

Here is the adjustment: Rub both sides of the pork chops with Taco Seasoning and let it sit in a couple of tablespoons of oil for a few hours. Salt and pepper pork chops and brown them in a little oil. Cut up the pork chops into bite size pieces. Make rice in rice cooker. Mix together the cut up pork chops with 1 can of the following in skillet diced tomatoes corn kidney beans green chili. Add a generous 1/2 teaspoon of the following seasonings: cumin cayenne garlic powder and Tabasco sauce plus 1 teaspoon of chili powder. Cook in skillet on medium /medium low heat for about 25 min. making sure the pork is cooked. Get out the pancake griddle (or big skillet). Spray it with Pam or put a little oil/butter on it. Place small size flour tortillas on griddle to warm. While warming on the griddle top the tortilla with the vegetable/meat mixture salsa sour cream grated cheese. Other ingredients might include black olives tomatoes & onion. Serve with the rice as a side dish or add the rice inside the tortilla. Fold the tortilla around the filling and eat. Great with Dos Equis beer. We all had second helpings.",

Substituting what I had on hand (1 can tomatoes with jalapenos frozen Mexican-style corn with black beans & onions & green peppers black beans) and using other reviewers' opinions (adding 1/4 c more rice topping chops with cheese added cumin) this has got to be one of my best meals. Everyone loved it including my mega-finicky 6-yr-old. I also Mrs. Dash'd the chops when browning them; they tasted great and were so tender. I also let the tomato mixture simmer on the stove for about 10 minutes to give the rice a head start. Turned out to be a good idea. Pork is not a major part of our diet but this will be the way I fix it from now on. Mexican cooking is so versatile so I can't wait to try this with chicken and beef.",
