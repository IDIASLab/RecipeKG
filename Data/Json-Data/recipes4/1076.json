Then taking a slotted spoon I removed to a warm platter while I prepared rest of meal.  Returned sausage to main pan for last ten minutes of cooking.  This way the potatoes and onion soaked up the flavor from the sausage oil.  And I was able to limit oil use to a little over 2 tablespoons.  Will prepare this again and again during the cold winter months.  Very economical too!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.",

It would help to brown the kielbasa in a separate skillet & then drain on paper towels. I used red potatoes and left the skins on which gave it a good flavor. Next time I'll definitely use fresh garlic as opposed to garlic powder.",

First I cooked the cubed potatoes in the microwave for apprx 8 min to speed up the process and then I took MC_MA's advice...cut that oil down to 2 TBLS. I also added 1 cup chopped broccoli (I bought one of those 3 lbs bags of pre-chopped broccoli and now I'm trying to use it up in almost every recipe I deem tasty) as well as 1/2c chopped celery. Also I used the polska kielbasa...HMMMMM. The flavors from the kielbasa really hype up the meal. I'm the only one in my family that melted some sharp cheddar cheese over my bowl but EVERYONE agreed this was an excellent tasting meal. I could only do what Christopher's Grandma said: \"EAT MORE!\" Thanks for sharing this recipe!",

My suggestion is to start out with a tbsp. or two and add everything to the pan at the same time that way the sausage will add it's share of fat (even the light sausage had plenty). I did it as the recipe stated & my potatoes started to get mushy by the time I added the sausage and then it kinda got greasy. My husband suggested the addition of sauerkraut next time. Good dish (the kids even ate it) thanks Christopher!",

We used some red and some green peppers to make it more colorful yellow onion and red potatoes. We also tried to make it more healthy by using olive oil instead of vegetable oil and reduced-fat brats instead of kielbasa (sliced thin so it still looks like you have lots of meat). We also left it uncovered and only cooked for about 15 minutes total to maintain some crispness to the veggies. Even with all our minor changes the basic recipe is still the same and it's a winner!",
