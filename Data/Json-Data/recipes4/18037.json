While the tofu gets slightly browned as directed it doesn't get near as brown as we like it. I have been experimenting with tofu all week and making recipes as directed but decided to let this one cook longer to see if I could get it where we liked it better. Brown food is GOOD food! I let this cook 10 minutes on one side and then flipped and let it cook another 10 minutes. Seems like overkill BUT it was crispy throughout and this made if very desirable for us. Not only was it crispy throughout the Cheez-it flavor was still there and dominant. Brown each side of your tofu to your own individual liking and you have a winner here!",
