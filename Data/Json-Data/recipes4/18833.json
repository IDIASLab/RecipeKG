I added 2 to 3 Tablespoons of  shredded coconut, in order to increase the coconut flavor as well as add a bit of sweetness. I also added about 1/4 cup of frozen baby peas. Then I cooked as instructed.  I did not add the coconut as garnish since it had already been stirred into the rice itself.  This turned out better than any coconut rice I have had in the past.

I cut the salt by about 1/8 or 1/4 teaspoon - I find many recipes benefit from less salt. Could that have been the problem?\nWhat about using more coconut milk, rather than the 1 C of water? Would mixture be too thick, and more prone to burning? Would a tiny bit of sugar, maybe 1/2 tsp, help.\nI think this has possibilities but I'm going to tweak it. I was hoping to serve it with very spicy shrimp or chicken.",
