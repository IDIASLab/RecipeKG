It doesn't require soaking the cashews and I didn't like the idea of straining the pulp after having added the vanilla and agave twice to boot. But I did follow the method and am happy with the results. I allowed the cashews water vanilla and agave to set for about an hour though. I used a vanilla bean (scraped) instead of extract. All-in-all this is a great drink and pretty accurate method. And the pulp made some fine cookies to go along with the milk.:-)",
