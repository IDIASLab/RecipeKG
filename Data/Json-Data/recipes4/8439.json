It certainly was easy to mix together but recipe says 24 muffins and I ended up with 36 mini muffins and 4 regular size muffins so confused about that too. Unlike the first photo uploaded on this recipe the chips melted into the muffin affecting the texture. They weren t bad they just weren't that good a bit bland. They ll be eaten but I won't be making these again. Sorry for the less than favorable review but I do want to be honest.",
