I made this again in the oven and followed another reviewer's tips - added 1 can French onion soup 1 can cream of mushroom soup 1 cup rice 1 can water added the chicken pieces on the top and baked at 350 for an hour uncovered. It was wonderful(!) but my chicken was a little overdone - I think 45 minutes would do it. The third time I made this I reduced the baking time to 45 minutes and the chicken was perfect...but the rice was crunchy. Aarrgh. Next time I will bake the rice 15-20 minutes THEN add the chicken and cook it 45 minutes. This dish is way too easy for me to throw it out. Thanks for the recipe!",

I made chicken and rice my way (one can french onion soup one can cream of mushroom soup one can water and one cup rice) and added fresh okra to the mix. Then put the chicken pieces on top and bake UNCOVERED for 1 hour at 350 degrees or until chicken juices run clear. Like this it was very good. The okra doesn't add a ton of flavor but it does add an extra helping of vegetables to an already good dish!",
