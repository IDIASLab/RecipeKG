For some reason I thought you HAD to have a frying pan that would go in the oven.  Also I never properly looked for a recipe.  Anyway, tonight the wait is over.  This recipe is so easy I figured even I couldn't mess it up, and I didn't.  I used chopped peppers, fresh mushrooms, onion flakes and half a tomato I had lying around.  My husband looked at it and said, \"WHAT is THAT?\" in tones of joy.  He was expecting a glorified omelette.  The fact that I've dared to post a photo shows you how good this was.",
