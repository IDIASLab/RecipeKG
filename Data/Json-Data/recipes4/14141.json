Sometimes I'll change the ingredients up and instead of beef broth and milk I use lemon-lime soda. This is also good with a mixture of Campbell's french onion soup Campbells beef broth and cream of mushroom soup. I also use fresh mushrooms whatever I have on hand. If I think of it sometimes I'll add a few spices a bay leaf or two. It's really good. This is also very adaptable for the crockpot. Just brown the meat like the recipe states then layer it in the crockpot with the other ingredients. I like this best over mashed potatoes but my boys like it best over steamed rice.",

You get the same flavor as using a more expensive meat cut but the seasoning and the slow simmer allow you to use stew meat and get a tender and flavorful result. The gravy cooks down beautifully and is nice and beefy without being overly salty. I used a bit more of the seasonings than was called for (personal taste) and also used an 8 oz package of fresh baby bellas instead of canned mushrooms. I followed the cooking directions faithfully and this turned out beautifully. Thanks Cindy!",
