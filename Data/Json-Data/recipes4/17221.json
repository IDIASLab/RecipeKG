Some of the ingredients might be difficult to find if you live outside a city, but it's absolutely worth going to an Asian/Japanese supermarket to find them! Also, they tend to keep well - so spend $10 on them now and you can make this lots of times.",

Then immerse them in boiling water for three minutes, afterwards drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. If you boil the noodles any longer than three minutes they will turn mushy.",
