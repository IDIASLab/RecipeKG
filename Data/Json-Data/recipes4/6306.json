It's as bland or spicy, as interesting or basic as you make it. This is the type recipe that is soooo flexible it's ridiculous! :D I sauteed some onion & garlic. Added about 3-4c leftover chicken, 1 cream of chicken soup, sour cream, 1 can undrained rotel, a cup of cheese, half cup black olives, some green onions ... the dorito part was actually about half doritos & the other half bottomofthebag cheezits, tortilla chips, potato chips. Oh, I added 1t spicy blackening seasoning. 'Fit in an 8x8 with more cheese then chips on top. Some black or pinto beans & corn would be a good addition. Jalapenos on top. 'Think you could skip the sour cream in it & just save that per serving. Tip: Watch the salt - meaning don't add any. Those chips add enough. This is quite filling, too. I'm tempted to say it's \"good teenage boy food\"! :) A few days later: K said I can make it again. :O That's as close to a compliment as I usually get - especially for an entree. Wow. :D",
