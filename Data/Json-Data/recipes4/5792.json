I slow roast the roast for 31/2 hours so that the roast absorbs more flavor. I no longer shred the pork with forks, rather I shred it with my fingers so that I can remove all chunks of fat and remove any slimy fat or gristle from the meat. A 3 pound pork shoulder roast will make about 4\u00bd packed cups of shredded pork. Use this base recipe for making carnitas, green chili or barbecue pork. Just use your favorite recipe for making green chili or barbecue pork with the pulled pork from this recipe.",

We frequent a restaurant that serves excellent carnitas, so this recipe caught my eye when I was looking for something to do with some pork for dinner.  \nI did make some additions, just because of my family's preferences.  I used a pork loin instead of a pork shoulder and it still came out perfect.  I didn't have any liquid smoke on hand, so I skipped that part.  After adding the pork back to the pot we dumped a bag full of roasted, peeled & chopped green chilis because we are New Mexican natives and that is what we do.  I thought it would make it really spicy, but it wasn't.  I felt that the green chili added an extra dimension that we really enjoyed.  We served it over warm corn tortillas with onions, tomatoes, cilantro and salsa.  It was an excellent meal.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, our family will repeat it over and over again.",

I used the boneless pork ribs I had on hand (3 were plenty for a dinner for 2 with leftovers). I kept all spices and proportions the same as stated in the recipe but added a squirt each of ketchup and dijon as well as a tablespoon of brown sugar to the chicken broth before placing in the oven. DONT get scared when your onions look almost burnt its just extreme carmelization and will add that \"thing\" to your pulled pork that is out of this world. i ended by tossing in a quality sweet BBQ sauce and serving on toasted bread. felt like I used a secret southern family recipe or something!! My boyfriend was floored:)",

Based on our preferences I modified this recipe as follows:  I used a 1.2lb pork tenderloin because that's the perfect size for one dinner for us. I skipped the onions since the kids won't eat them. I added 2T honey to the liquid.  I accidentally used 2 1/4 Tablespoons liq smoke instead of teaspoons (oops!!). And I seared the meat in a skillet but put the meat and liquid into a glass baking dish covered with foil to bake it. I only cooked it for 2.5 hours. Now the result:  THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.   So simple to make and the whole family loved it!!  The smoke flavor was wonderful, and I would use 2T again. It was not overpowering at all and had a nice flavor. Most of all this was incredibly moist!  After I shredded the meat i tossed it back in the baking pan with tongs, just coating all the meat with he liquid. pretty much all got absorbed back into the meat. It was not greasy at all and so moist and flavorful.  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe.",
