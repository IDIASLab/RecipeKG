        "description": "One Halloween I decided to try out a macaroni and cheese recipe using pumpkin, and it turned out to be a huge hit. The combination of the cheeses and the pumpkin made it so very rich and creamy. The next time I decided to make this dish I added some cooked lobster I had left over, and from there I just fell in love. I have had lobster macaroni and cheese dishes before, but never anything like this. All of this may sound strange and unusual but once you try this dish you will never get it out of your head. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve with fresh bread or dinner rolls.",

Absolutely loved the creaminess of the cheese sauce.  Very rich and creamy macaroni and cheese.  My husband found it hard to believe that there was pumpkin in the recipe too!  Overall a great success and would easily make again.  Thinking that adding in some grilled chicken and jalapeno's would also make a nice variation.",

It is very easy to make and quite tasty. I was surprised I liked the pumpkin added to the cheese but it gave it that extra something and the lobster really goes well in thi!

Also I didn't have access to real lobster so I went with the imitation and it was actually pretty good. Most of us doused the mac n cheese with extra hot sauce - so good.

I did not have shallots so used onion and garlic from my garden also replaced soft cheese with cream cheese - the consistency taste and ease of making made this one of my all-time favorites. Loved the addition of the pumpkin (also from my garden) and the peas; the spices were perfect. This will be a family favorite for years to come!",
