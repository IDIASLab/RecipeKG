I worked to recreate it from a number of similar recipes, but it required some improvisation because there's nothing like it. The garlic is an integral part, and if you love the stuff, you can dial it up to a full bunch. The true Roman-style is without grated Parmesan on top, but if you love the stuff, it's fine with as well.",

But it won me over with the first bite.  I left out the anchovy due to allergies but agree that they should go in there so if you can do add them.  I also had to use fresh hot peppers.  I ate this dish with and without parmiggiano reggiano and can say it is delicious both ways.  The olives, tomatoes and hazelnuts made for a very interesting texture in each bite, albeit it took a minute to get used to but the flavours were heaven together.  The marsala adds a good flavour to compliment the spice, nut and tang of the other ingredients.  If you look at this and go, \"no way!\", you are making a mistake.  It's one-of-a-kind flavour will creep up on you and will win you over by the first bite!  Thanks for sharing.",
