I used 16 oz of frozen black eyed peas because that is what I had and used one can of white kidney( cannellini) beans instead of garbanzo again because that is what I had on hand. I didn't drain any of the canned beans.I also diced up 4 carrots and 3 ribs of celery and sauteed them with the onion and garlic--which I increased to 4 cloves. I also added 6 slices of browned and crumbled bacon with a few tsp. of the drippings to the stew plus 1 tsp. of chili powder and some fresh ground black peper. The ham & the bacon added enough salt. It simmered all day on low and was perfect for supper with the sweet cornbread recipe ( found on this site) and cole slaw. Even my VERY picky 10 year old daughter loved this stew. My parents happened to stop by & since this makes plenty they stayed and enjoyed it too!! My dad said this is the best bean soup he'd ever had so my mom took the recipe home! Hard to believe something so simple made with common ingredients could be this tasty! For a little extra kick--some of us added a few shakes of green jalapeno hot sauce. This is a winner--just like the Indy Colts!!",
