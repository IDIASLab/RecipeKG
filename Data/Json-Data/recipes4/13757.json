I wouldn't change a thing.  The steaks held together well, and beef base and worchestershire sauce flavored the steaks just right. I would suggest spraying the pan before browning the meat. I cooked in an electric skillet which was large enough to cook all of the patties at once.  Thanks for a good and easy recipe.   ",
