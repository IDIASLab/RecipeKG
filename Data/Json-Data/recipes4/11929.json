It was an interesting experience though and I am still interested in learning about bread starters but I don't think this is for beginners. I ended up with a lot of Biga left over after I tried the foccocia bread recipe so I modified the Amish friendship bread recipe (also from this site) the best that I could and used it for that. The Amish friendship bread was good and the fermented flavor of the biga in the bread was yummy but I think one needs to know a little about bread before trying this particular method.",
