This recipe came up and I had everything to make it so that's the tale of how this recipe made it to the dinner table last night. My son ate two pieces which I consider to be a huge success. Other members of the family had second helpings which is almost better because it shows my son that adults love their veggies! The only change I made was to add a pinch of salt (canned green beans probably don't need any added salt). Of course I also steamed the beans before adding to the sauce. Delish! I will definitely make this simple recipe again.",
