I happen to enjoy a very spicy chili so I added about 1/2 tbl. more chili powder 1/2 tbl more cayenne pepper 2 diced jalapenos & 1 tsp more cumin powder. I also found the chili to be a little too runny because of all the water. I simmered for an extra 20 minutes and it was still \"soupier\" then I prefer. Next time I would add 3 cups during the first step adding water in the recipe but I would only add 1 cup in the second step adding water in the recipe. I served it by topping with sliced jalapenos sour cream shredded mexican cheese & chopped cilantro. Will make again...",
