I will sprinkle the chicken with paprika to give it some color. We decided that another good way to serve this is like the \"Pepperoncini Beef\" from this site. After the chicken is cooked strip it off the bones put the chicken and jalapenos on a hoagie roll top with provolone cheese and broil until the cheese melts.- Tried a second time halved the recipe omitted the frying sprinkled with paprika and cooked for one hour. Great results!",
