After tasting it, I decided to drizzle in some maple syrup, as well for a tiny extra sweetness.  I used two pork tenderloins and added thinly sliced potatoes, carrots and peas.  I drizzled the marinade over all and roasted for 15 minutes at 400, then lowered the temp to 350 and roasted an additional 30 minutes.  10 minutes under a foil tent and it was the most delicious pork tenderloin I've ever made in 36 years of cooking.

Then I let it marinade in the bag for 2 days (because I forgot about it). I made sandwiches on garlic bread and added provolone cheese and broiled for a couple of minutes to brown the cheese. Both of my sons had 2 big sandwiches and said it was the best they ever had.  I will definetly add this to our rotation. This is a very easy and tasty recipe. Plus there wasn't a lot to clean up. That's my kind of recipe. Thanks Lori!",

I was so impressed i'm writing my first ever review after being on this site for years. It was AMAZING!!! By far the most moist and tender pork tenderloin i've EVER made. The flavor was perfect, but i can only imagine the longer you marinate it the better it will be. The only thing I did different was I took out the salt because soy sauce is salty enough as it is. I marinated it for about 1.5 hours in the fridge, took it out while preheating my oven to let the temperature come down a little, then cooked it for 60 minutes at 350.I had 2 tenderloins and they cooked perfectly! I was 100000% satisfied with this recipe and will cook it again and again.",

You can definitely tweak this and use what you have (ie. I didn't have enough soy sauce so I used what I had and topped it with rice wine vinegar and added more salt).  I marinated the pork overnight too.  I poured the marinade over the pork (per the recipe) before putting it in the over but it got overcaramelized.  I think next time I'll add the marinate midway through the baking time, maybe 15 mins into it. I only had 2 pcs of tenderloin so it only took 30 mins to cook.",
