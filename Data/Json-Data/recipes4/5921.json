I have a recipe that I just love, but this is definitely gonna replace it, as it was even better than that one, and it took a lot less time to make too! I used Wondra flour in place of the regular flour b/c it blends easier, (I used a tablespoon or 2 more than called for). I did not have any thyme on hand, b/c I'm not a fan of it, so I omitted that. After the soup was done, I added a little more salt (personal preference) and some browning seasoning to make it a richer color. I toasted my bread on both sides and rubbed it w/ garlic before putting it on top of the soup. I am so glad I decided to make this today...it was a hit w/ all of us and my new go-to onion soup recipe~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

My husband, who didn't think he liked French Onion soup, ate 2 bowls.  He said his \"taste buds must have changed\".  We really liked this recipe, and I will make it again.

The cooking times for the onions was longer - nearly 1 hour 15 minutes.  With onion soup, I think it is more important to pay attention to the onions than to monitor time (look for carmelization in the first stage, and boil off most of the liquid during the second stage).  I also omitted the flour because the stock did not require a thickening agent.  I used about 1/2 cup of sherry to deglaze  Very good, but I highly recommend making beef stock.",
