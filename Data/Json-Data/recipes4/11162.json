My friends know it as one of my trademark drinks, and call it \"Ghetto Margaritas.\"  Instead of using frozen limeade concentrate, I use a bottle of limeade (now becoming more and more popular- Simply Limeade is my preference), therefore eliminating the need for water.  I mix equal parts white rum or white tequilla with the limeade.  Whenever possible, I'll soak some strawberries in the alcohol for a few hours before adding the juice to add a little treat to the cocktail.  WARNING: the acidity of limeade neutralizes alcohol taste- this can get you very drunk without you even knowing it- be careful!",

I served this over the ice instead of blending it all together--sooo good. This is one of THE best alcoholic drinks I have ever had!! Great with Cuban or Mexican food.",
