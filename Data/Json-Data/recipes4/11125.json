The other thing I would do would be to make sure the edges were sealed better because you do get some oozing out of the cheese. Also I would recommend cutting the water in half for the topping and only putting on half as much topping altogether because it runs off of the meat loaf and just ends up on the pan where it burns and makes it real hard to clean up. Other than that great taste and with these few adjustments makes a great meal the family will absolutely love!!",

I used shredded cheese (what I had on hand) I didnt add the water to the topping and added some horseradish and brown sugar to it (very tasty) and I poked holes in the top to give the cheese somewhere to go (its going to find a way out so give it somewhere to go). The small amount of cheese that oozed out ended up on top of the meatloaf instead of the pan. Very nice change of pace for meatloaf. Thanks for the great recipe!!",

I also added a pack of dried spices used to marinate steak to flavor the beef and give it some heat. I used 8x3 pans so I had to break the beef into 2 pans (same temperature and baked for 1 hour). I used mozz with one pan and gouda with the other. There was a lot of liquid in the pans after cooking due to the veggies added but those were easy to pour off or just remove the meatloaf from the pan before serving it. We enjoyed the gouda cheese more than the mozz but that's just personal preference. Also made my own homemade BBQ sauce for on top. I hardly ever use plain water in any recipe why dilute the flavor of your food when you can enhance it. All in all this recipe is a good base to build a great recipe. Mmmmmm leftovers rock!",

I recommend cooking it for about 15 minutes longer than it says that way it hold better to the knife. I used shredded cheese. When it says rectangle I rolled it out to about 18 inces long and about 8 inches wide. Pinch the ends together so the cheese doesn't melt out the sides and poke holes in top. Get creative with the cheeses!",

I used shredded cheese and I think that made it easier to roll. I also put the wax paper on a cookie sheet so that I could use it as a form - worked GREAT.
