Second The amount of soup/water mixture in the recipe is inadequate. I doubled it since I luckily had two cans of soup on hand. I also added a breadcrumb/cheese topping to the top and baked it for about 8 more minutes uncovered. My husband really liked this dish and I thought it was good but it wasn't as cheesy as I was hoping. I would probably add cheddar cheese to the soup mixture if I were to make it again.",

I used my own cheese sauce and in the future will add salt to the potatoes before cooking. Also the directions were a little vague after adding the broccoli: recover and put back in the oven or not? Mix the broccoli in or layer? I layered everything artfully arranging the broccoli on top which required a few extra minutes in the oven (covered!) and sprinkled more cheese on top which the kids loved. Next time I'll add a little garlic and white pepper for a little more pizzaz and maybe some red bells. The kids loved it and my husband scraped his plate. I give an extra star for that! I would say that this recipe is a good place to start.",
