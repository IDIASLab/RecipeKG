        "description": "This is a rice and sausage stuffing that is always a hit. No one ever tires of eating this as leftovers - it doesn't even need any turkey to go with it to make a nice snack or meal. But stuff a turkey with it, and you have an excellent alternative to traditional bread stuffings. The recipe shown here is the huge Thanksgiving-day-with-tons-of-leftovers version. You can obviously cut it down proportionately for smaller meals. The original recipe, as I received it, called for addition of a couple of cans of shucked oysters, something not to my taste, but you can add this if you wish.",
