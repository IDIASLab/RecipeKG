Instead of ketchup, I used 8 oz. of organic tomato sauce and I added a little Liquid Smoke and two teaspoons of Stacey's Hamburger Seasoning (minus the salt). Every bit of this was inhaled. I ate mine without the croutons with a lot of lettuce and I served this with Roasted New Potatoes for my three men. I found that just a little of this cheeseburger filling was plenty filling for me as a salad and everyone enjoyed it. I'll make this again.",

I used onion powder instead of real onion and subbed some mustard powder for prepared mustard. The key to this is not letting the beef cool you want the beef hot from the skillet. The hot meat and the fresh crisp cold lettuce was just like eating handheld burger.  Great combo! I topped this with some homemade thousand island dressing. Wonderful recipe. Thanks!",
