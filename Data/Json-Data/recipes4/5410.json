The creamy dressing I used was Honey Mustard II dressing from this site, and because of that I combined the honey mustard requirement with the creamy dressing requirement to make this.  I was thinking that this will be good tomorrow on a sandwich for lunch along with a couple of slices of ham.  I would definitely make this recipe again!  We loved it!",

For the creamy salad dressing I used coleslaw dressing. The serving sizes are huge! I served it over mixed lettuce greens and it turned out wonderful. Update: The second time I made this I used fresh pineapple -- definitely better and increased the curry powder to 1/4 tsp because we love curry. Will definitely make this again and again!",

I skipped the red pepper used mayo in place of salad dressing and used sweet pickle relish. I eyeballed all of the ingredients which came together in almost a tropical tasting salad. The curry was a nice addition; I added more of that and as well as the garlic powder. Look forward to this for lunch during the week. Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe Barbara!",
