Instead of pouring the sauce over the wings, i basted them liberally with the sauce through out the grilling process. They were fantastic. I set aside extra sauce for dipping.The only thing i will do differently next time will be to omit the salt. It was a wee bit on the salty side. I think the hot sauce has plenty of salt as is. I think i will also omit the butter. With all the sweet honey, i dont think it will be missed and i will be eliminating all that unnecessary fat! I will definitely be making these again very soon!**Update: Ok, dont eliminate the butter..its waaay to spicy!",

I had these wings years ago at a Detroit restaurant when I visited there and, I wanted this recipe so bad I couldn't stand it (the restaurant owners wouldn't give it to me...family secret and all.) I followed your recipe last night, although I did add a little more heat to them and some fresh garlic (this is a mainstay in my kitchen) and my family just wild for them! Next time, I will have to triple the recipe because they were gone faster than I could sit down and grab a couple for myself! I did add a little more heat to them and some fresh garlic. Any city that can boast such a great chicken wing recipe deserves thanks.....so, GO \"RED WINGS\"!! :>D     \n",

My husband and I who like spicy then dipped our wings in additional hot sauce and blue cheese dressing. I really wasn't sure how I'd feel about the honey and my husband who is a huge hot wing fan seemed just a little skeptical, but we were all pleased with the results.

I took the advice of another reviewer, baking them in the oven for 30 minutes on 400 degrees. I seasoned with cayenne and pepper, then poured about half of the sauce on top to cook them in. Once done, I tossed them in the remaining sauce and I, my 15 month old, and 8 year old devoured them! I probably would not use quite as much honey next time, and the heat is very flexible. These wings came out soooo tender. Thanks so much for this recipe!",

I followed the recipe directions as provided except I only had 1.5 pounds of wings so I cut back to 2/3 the recipe (Honey butter and Frank s original hot sauce plus one tablespoon Tabasco) which is a little less than 3/4. This recipe had zero heat and way way too much sweetness. WHAT WAS I THINKING??? I normally will use 1/2 cup Frank s for every 1/4 cup butter plus a little Tabasco and ZERO sweetener of any kind. Also the honeyed wings do tend to burn easily on the grill so be very careful and keep watching.",
