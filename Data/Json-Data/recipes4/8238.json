Took it out of the fridge about an hour before I started cooking it so it wouldn't be quite so cold going into the oven.\n\n I used Panko Italian Breadcrumbs because I like lots of crunch and used Dijon mustard instead of mustard powder. I cooked it at 385 deg instead of 375 deg and since I wanted it nice and toasty on top I let it cook for longer than the recommended 30 min. Maybe let it go for about 45 minutes or so, uncovered, checking it every 15 minutes to make sure it wasn't torched! Delicious, and not much leftover!",

Should really add what size baking tray this recipe is supposed to use. I only used on head of the two cauliflower that was called for. I also doubled the shredded cheddar. It made for a much creamier sauce. It was a hit at the Christmas dinner potluck. Good recipe with some minor portion revisions.",
