Well, here's what they can do: they'll jet-pack you back to when your mom made chicken for a weekday night (even though it's flavorful and divine enough to serve to guests). It will also let the cooked chicken speak pretty much for itself, without smothering it in a sauce.\n\nI confess I was leery. I wanted to add rosemary, or oregano, or (good grief) even Lawry's Seasoned Salt. But I resisted and, I must say, it was worth it.\n\nThe ingredients are simple, and that makes it an easy dish to make. If you use organic chicken breasts, it's going to be moist in any case. But adding the olive oil, salt, and pepper, blend in a way that might make you swoon in the way I swooned when I ate it. Simple, homey, cozy, and (in so many ways) perfect. \n\nNext time you're in a hurry for a knock-'em-dead meal, serve this up as the main player. I'm pretty sure you'll wow whoever's eating. \n\nThis is one fine recipe.",
