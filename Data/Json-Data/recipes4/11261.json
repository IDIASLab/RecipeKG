The bread has an unusual taste because of the anise seed and is kind of like eating soft pizzelles. I think I would add more raisins next time to better balance the anise taste. The crust is chewy without being crisp and is very nice. It's definitely an out of the ordinary bread. I served it with homemade butter.",

My changes were to increase all ingredients: 4 cups flour (1 of which was my home-ground whole wheat flour) 2 tsp yeast 1 1/2 tbsp honey 1 c water 3/4 tsp salt 2 1/2 tbsp butter decreased anise seeds to 2 tbsp but added 1 tbsp anisette liqueur (my dough seemed a bit dry) and kept raisins the same.

It s fairly moist and rises well in any traditional shape. Needs no topping or spread. The difference I had was this. 1 cup hot water (100 degrees f or so) Add yeast directly to the water with 1 tsp of sugar to activate and mix well. You should see foam rising to the top. Then add to the other dry ingredients. Follow all other directions as posted:)",
