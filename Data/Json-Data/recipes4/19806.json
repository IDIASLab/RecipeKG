Consistency was pretty thick so I did add some vanilla almond milk and some maple syrup and I must say I liked it MUCH better after the addition of those two ingredients. We re not big into sweetness these days but I think this needed some sweetness and the maple syrup took care of that. I like the combo of ingredients in this recipe they partnered well just didn t care for the texture of the oats. I plan to try this again with regular oatmeal and if it turns out more to our satisfaction I ll do an update for any other folks who also may not be steel cut oats fans. It certainly is super simple to make and that I love. I m the first reviewer and I don t want to discourage anybody from trying this. My comments are based on our personal taste preferences. Pamela Wurtz thanks for sharing your recipe.",

My problem with this recipe was the amount of salt called for. I should have known better but I was still tired this morning and I put in the full 1/2 tsp salt. It was too salty for me. I added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar which helped. I wouldn't add more than an 1/8 tsp of salt in the future. I added some half and half on top which is a nice touch and they were okay.",
