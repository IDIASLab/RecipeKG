Most importantly, make sure you don't use chicken that has been \"enhanced with broth.\" The outcome is not nearly as good, but in one instance that was all that was available at the store. Both times I've used chicken breasts and used a meat mallet to flatten them and cooked them a little longer. I used Ken's Steakhouse Italian dressing with Aged Romano, it's perfect! Last but not least, we prefer it without the lemon zest, which can be bitter if you bite into a piece. Using fresh lemon juice gives it enough flavor.",

I used 6 boneless chicken breasts, and pounded them flat so the cooking time would be shorter.  I did marinate the chicken in some of the Italian dressing and lemon juice for a few hours before baking.  I baked them in 2 pans, and so doubled the sauce recipe and divided it between the 2 pans.  The chicken was moist and flavorful!  I served it with brown rice, green beans, and french rolls.  Everyone's favorite part was pouring the extra sauce from the cooked chicken over the rice.  I will definitely make this again for my family...quick, easy, pretty healthy, and delicious!!",

It had great flavor and stayed surprisingly most for chicken breast. Also as other reviewers noted the sauce is great with the rice. My boyfriend is very picky and he asked me to put it in the rotation so it must be good! One thing I particularly liked was that it used common ingredients so I didn't have to make a special trip to the store and it was super quick and easy to put together.

I used a darker basalmic vinegar-style Italian dressing from Trader Joe's and I feared it would be too potent but it was great. I didn't have any fresh lemons so I used 2.5 tablespoons of a good-quality lemon juice. I tasted the sauce before adding the chicken and it was strong- but it definitley mellows out during cooking. Served with whole wheat fettucini and steamed veggies- garlic bread would have been great with it too but I didn't have any. Enjoy this one!",
