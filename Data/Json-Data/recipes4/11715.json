I made this for my fathers birthday and he said chicken in a gumbo sounded odd so he asked for beef sausage instead. Also there were no fresh cayenne peppers at the store so I used 3 small dried red colored peppers (very spicy). Over all this had a great flavor with the perfect amount of spice. Even my mom and sister who don't like spicy foods really enjoyed this gumbo. I will no doubt make this again and again but may not cook the okra quite so long.",
