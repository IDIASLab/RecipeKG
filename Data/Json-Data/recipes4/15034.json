I'm thinking I just need to do something to the mixture to get it to hold so I'll tinker around with it a bit as my zucchini crop comes in and keep trying. I had planned on making the dressing but realized I had no mayonnaise so I will make that next time also. Overall a really good recipe with nice flavor hopefully next time I make these I can get mine to look as good as the ones in the picture! Thanks for sharing your recipe!",
