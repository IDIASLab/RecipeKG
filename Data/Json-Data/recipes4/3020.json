I also added a little bit of fresh dill.... tasted GREAT (with a little bit of salt too). To help make sure the potatoes and chicken were fully cooked I sliced the potatoes thinly AND sliced my chicken breast halves in half. I admit that after I cooked the chicken at 350 for 45 minutes I still had to increase the temp to 400 for an additional 30 minutes! I have plenty of squash in my garden and I'm always looking for different recipes to use them in so they don't go to waste! It seemed to be a hit with the hubby and kids. I'll be making this again experimenting with different herbs and spices!",

The pototoes were still hard so I had to throw them out my chicken was dried out about the only thing that was good was the squash. I served with sauteed asparagus. I might try again but change it up a lot otherwise I didn't like this at all.",
