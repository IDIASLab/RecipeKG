Looked at another recipe and added 1 tablespoon of dried parsley, 1 tsp of chili powder, 1 tablespoon of worsh. and 2 tablespoons of dijon mustard.  Came out fabulous with great flavor!  Don't forget the ham bone.  Sometimes the Honey Baked Ham store sells ham bones\u2026mmmm, mmmm, good!",

I used 4 cups broth, 2 cups water.  The store was out of 15 bean soup mix so I used the dried great northern white beans (16 oz bag) in place of it and omitted the can of northern white beans, of course.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and will use again whenever I have a ham bone.  Blending two cups of soup and adding back in one hour prior to serving helped to slightly thicken up and enhanced flavor.  thanks for the recipe!",

I would probably add more liquid and a smaller pack of beans next time. Even after soaking overnight (and adding more water to the soaking after a couple hours because it was all soaked up!) it was more beans and less soup for us.  Definitely the flavor was delicious and we have been eating leftovers of it for a few days. I recommend serving with cornbread or a sourdough loaf.",
