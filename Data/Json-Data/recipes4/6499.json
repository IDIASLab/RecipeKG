                "reviewBody": "I am from Maryland born and bred. This is the way to make crab cakes except they are typically fried in a lot of hot oil or broiled. Of course the essential ingredient in this recipe is the crab meat followed closely by authentic Old Bay. The crab should be blue crab from the Chesapeake Bay region Florida Louisiana or other Gulf of Mexico states. I live near Atlanta now and there is only one place to get great crab. Believe it or not the alternative is Paramount Preserve Premium Lump Crabmeat from Sam's Club. This company is headquartered in my old stomping grounds of Glen Burnie Maryland. The crab comes from the west coast of Mexico. It is not blue crab but is very very close. Much better than crab from Asia packaged by Phillips (a Maryland company) and others. I mix the ingredients then refrigerate for a couple of hours when there is time. It is a good idea to refrigerate the crab cakes after they are formed for 30 minutes but it is not crucial. It helps them stay together in the pan. Enjoy this recipe from the Land of Pleasant Living!",

I thought it'd be okay based on previous reviews because we like things a bit salty but wow they weren't kidding. Since the description says that healthy dose of seafood seasoning I can't really complain but to those making this recipe take caution. I'm sad because otherwise the recipe would have been excellent. I'll try again with less old bay and no added salt. I also baked for 15 minutes and broiled for 10 to get top crispy. Made 6 nice sized cakes.",
