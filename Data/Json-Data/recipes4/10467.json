I've made this twice so far and the first time it tasted a bit on the bland side so the second time around I added another chix bouillon cube. It still tastes like it's missing something though. Next time I decide to make this maybe I'll add yet another bouillon cube and maybe some diced onions or something like some other reviewers mentioned. I also used a cup of frozen green peas both times which added a nice color and taste to it. Thanks Melissa.",
