My recipe is a little different though-I don't use regular noodles I use 1 box of vermicceli, it also says Fideo on it in the pasta isle (yelloe box w/ red lettering) and 1 can of diced tomatos with green onions seasoned in them. 1/2 cup of chicken stock or i can of water.  I usually make this w/o any chicken or meat if I'm looking for a fast meal. Just melt 3 tbls butter in skillet and then add fideo stirring constantly until light browned.Then pour in 1 can of diced tomatoes and 2 cans of water or the chicken stock, bring to a boil and then cover and simmer for 10-15 min until fideo noodles are al dente. I then add more chicken stock if it seems to thick for me and then I add grated cheddar cheese and eat with a warm flour tortilla. I season as needed w/ salt and pepper, maybe some cumin. very easy meal to make.",
