Cut off the end with the stem and poke holes in the okra so it will absorb the sauce. This recipe was also extremely bland in comparison with Egyptian recipes. I added 2 tbsp freshly crushed garlic, 1 teaspoon cumin, 4 cardamon pods, and 1 tsp coriander which is how my mother-in-law (who is Egyptian) suggested to make it my second time around. With the right seasoning and proper preparation this would be a great recipe.",
