After adding Lawry's Seasoned Salt fresh cracked pepper and garlic powder I found that it still needed something else to improve the taste. I then added a can of diced tomatoes a sprinkle of sugar to reduce the acidity of the tomatoes and 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese. The addition of all these other ingredients made it edible but not something I would make again.",
