This is a trick that breadmakers in Italy use to keep the mixture from sticking! :-) My original teview: This is just like I had in Portofino from the street side bakeries. \"La farinata\" as it is called in Italy is a fast and easy alternative to cornbread and wheat bread. This recipe is perfect leaving you with a flavourful, sponge-like focaccia to enjoy with salads, soup or on its own. The method is right on. I let it sit for 4 hours uncovered but was told by the submitter of this recipe it is best covered. Mine tasted just fine nonetheless. It cooks up quickly and takes only minutes to put together. It is also nice the next day reheated on the grill similar to polenta, crisping it to be used for appetisers and even as a base for gluten free pizza! Thank you sueb for sharing this recipe.",

However, it stuck all over the pan (even though I greased the pan) and seemed under done to me despite cooking it the allotted amount of time and waiting for it to brown on the edges. I plan on trying this again, but I will take the advice of other recipes for the same thing and use a cast iron skillet, heat the pan up until the oil just starts to smoke, pour the batter into the centre of the pan, and then bake in the oven until it browns at a bit more than just at the very edges. Heating the pan before adding the batter is supposed to prevent sticking.",
