                "reviewBody": "This was awesome!! Everyone loved it. I used a bit more bacon than called for (it was for a party, darnit! Party calories don't count, right?), and added a quarter of a red onion, finely chopped, and a couple small handfuls of chopped green onion for extra bite and crunch.(Omitted the celery due to personal preference)  Used those tiny red-skinned potatoes, cut in half -- their waxy flesh holds up better to boiling, and the there's less risk of a mushy potato salad. (Plus, no peeling!) Garnishing with the sliced egg didn't work for me, it just didn't look right. So I mixed in all the egg, and just sprinkled parseley and bacon on top, and it looked great. Very easy to omit the bacon for a vegetarian version. \n\nAn easy way to cook the bacon: line a baking sheet with foil, then place bacon strips on the pan. Place pan in a COLD oven, then turn the heat up to 350F. After about 15 minutes (varies dep. on how crispy you like your bacon), you'll get perfect bacon, with minimal mess. It tastes better than microwaved bacon (plus no lingering smells in the microwave), clears up space on the stove top, and you can even stack the bacon in 2-slice layers if you need to make a lot (works best for bacon that will be crumbled, as the slices tend to stick together). Anyway, thanks for the recipe, it was SO good!",

                "reviewBody": "Just average as written but a good start to make it your own. Novice cooks will appreciate cooking instructions for the eggs and potatoes although even that is done differently from cook to cook. I didn't care for the idea of mincing the celery or mashing the eggs - it seemed to me this would make it more like potato salad PASTE. I wanted more texture so I chopped everything and cut the potatoes into bite-size chunks. I added red orange yellow and green bell peppers for extra flavor color and crunch as well as green onion. I love the bacon and Dijon mustard but I don't care for straight mayonnaise in salads like this so I cut it half and half with sour cream. Finally rather than seasoning with just salt and pepper I used Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt and lemon pepper. Again a nice foundation but this recipe really needs some embellishment to personal taste. With my additions and changes I ended up with some great potato salad.",
