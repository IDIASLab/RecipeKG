I used three sweet sausages and two hot sausages, cut off the casings and browned it all together.  I had fresh basil, so I chopped it up and used about 1/8cup.  I used more garlic than it calls for, but I ALWAYS do - we LOVE garlic!  Also, I intended to buy zucchini, but upon closer inspection, it was an italian squash...not the same thing, but it was still tasty.  I will buy a zucchini next time though.  I chopped all of the veggies up very small, hoping my daughter would eat them (no dice!).  My husband commented on how small they were, and that he preferred them that way - I do, too...you get more flavors in one bite if they're smaller.  I used a 15oz can of tomato sauce because another reviewer said it needed more sauce.  SUPER yummy!  Thanks so much!!  :)",

It really made it wonderful!! I was planning to use two cans of diced tomatoes (b/c so many people said it needed more sauce) but realized I only had one so I improvised and threw in 3/4 of a can of creamy tomato soup (the kind you microwave and drink) and it came out wonderful!! I froze some for a future dinner and can only imagine how flavorful it will be when I eat it!! I used Jimmy Dean's sage flavored sausage and added some crushed red pepper to give it a kick. Will probably use spicy sausage next time. Thank you Heather for a terrific & easy to make recipe!! ",

The only changes I made were these...I simmered is for an hour after added the 28oz (not 14 oz) can of petite diced tomatos, along with 1 T of white sugar. Also, I put small dollops of creamy ricotta cheese on top of each serving, and just sprinkles of parmesan, if wnated. The ricotta was the perfect addition to this very mellow yet rich tomato-ey sauce. Ooooooh, this one is a keeper!",

That's okay though--we didn't miss the peppers at all. I did add another can of diced tomatoes and I'm glad I did. Next time however I'd drain one of the cans of tomatoes--it ended up a bit watery. Still this has great flavor and is a wonderful one dish meal. I flavored the sausage by using the Italian Style Sausage recipe from AR and then I used cheese tortellini not rotini pasta. It turned out wonderfully. I got a little carried away with using up items from my freezer and ended up with half the sauce not needed to cover the pasta. However no big deal. We'll definitely eat more of this this week! I'm not a leftover fan but I'd eat this again right away. Thanks for the recipe!",
