I brought things to a boil after loading the pot then turned down to a simmer. I used fresh green beans and frozen corn. I also used white potatoes which worked fine. Red are firmer over time but this didn't last long. Could add some canned tomatoes next time perhaps.",

I didn't put any corn in because it seemed out of place and the potatoes took a little longer to get tender than the recipe says. I used canned green beans and they worked fine. It's nice to have a recipe you can throw together and walk away from and it turns out delicious and filling. Thanks!",
