This is enough pork to feed 6 generously. One cup of olive oil has about 225 grams of fat! So if you use all of the dressing and serve four the fat and calories ARE correct. That being said no need to dump all the dressing on DRIZZLE it as suggested and reduce the fat and calories by a HUGE amount to about 22 grms fat per serving if you use just half the dressing. Second this is absolutely delicious so fresh tasting. Thanks for posting I have never used kale before and am glad to have found this recipe! And most of the fat is the heart healthy kind anyway!",

I subsctituted garlic salt for about three cloves of fresh garlic and I used fresh cilantro. I also zested one of the limes. I whirled everything in the cuisinart. I also seared the tenderloin before I put it in the oven. AWESOME! SO TENDER AND TASTY. And for those who don't like cilantro the lime kills the bitter cilantro taste.",
