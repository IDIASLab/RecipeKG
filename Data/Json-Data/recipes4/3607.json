The key is to make sure they are bite sized - you must put the whole piece in your mouth or you'll make a mess! I spread 1/3 cup of mozzerella on each side instead of the 1/4c that the recipe called for just to make the bites a bit sturdier. I spread the mozzerella around the phyllo dough kind of like a barrier to help keep the chowder from seeping out. Will definitely use again and may tweak for other flavors.",
