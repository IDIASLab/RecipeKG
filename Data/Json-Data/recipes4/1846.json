I served the lamb over couscous rather than rice and used a side dish of a sweet potato casserole.  This was a nice combination of flavors that complimented each other and was rich and flavorful.

My husband didn't like it as much as I did and I'm guessing the combination of textures and the sweetness being rather unusual for the American palate is why this recipe has some lower ratings.
