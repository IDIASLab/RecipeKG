I also had to add more flour after my first batch came out somewhat flat and near impossible to take off of the cookie sheet. I'd increase flour to at least 1 1/4 C. Also a tip is leave them out of an air-tight container at least for the first night. I put mine in after they were out for about an hour and they were somewhat pancake-like in \"crispness\" the next day. It didn't affect the flavour I just prefer crispier cookies. Beyond those small changes these were FANTASTIC like a healthy bowl of apple cinnamon oatmeal inside a cookie. The house smelled great while they were cooking too.",

I made a couple changes: I creamed 2/3 c applesauce in with the wet ingredients in place of the chopped apple to save work. I also used 1 c rolled oats and 1/2 c quick oats instead of all quick oats. I also used real butter in place of margarine. These are VERY good and are quickly becoming my lunch. I'm going to bake a ton of them and put them in the freezer for quick snacks and breakfasts. P.S. The cookies are very moist when made with 2/3 c applesauce and might fall apart easily when being removed from the cookie sheet. I used parchment paper underneath the cookies in place of greasing the sheets so I didn't have this problem. I just slid the paper off the cookie sheets on to the counter to cool after allowing them to cool on the sheets for five minutes. They are a hold-in-the-hand cookie instead of a hold-by-the-edge cookie.",

I don't use margarine (I'd recommend using butter instead as there is nothing natural about margarine) and we have dairy and egg allergies in the family so I replaced the margarine with the same amount of unsweetened applesauce and used 1/2 a mashed banana for the egg. I also didn't feel like cutting up an apple so I used 1/2 cup raisins. I love the way they came out: moist chewy just the right of sweetness and all wholesome ingredients! My two year old and I gobbled them up! In fact my biggest problem was not eating all the cookies in one sitting. They're so small; it's easy to have just one more! I'm looking forward to experimenting with this recipe and will definitely try with the apples. Yum!",
