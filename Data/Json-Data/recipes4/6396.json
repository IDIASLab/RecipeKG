I always thought that a \"flavorful\" quiche had to have tomatoes and cheddar. And HAD to have a crust. This recipe has changed my mind. I only added 1 cup cream and added in two more eggs. The texture was perfect it rose up beautifully and it was cooked consistently throughout. May add a bit more Swiss cheese next time. My family asked that I make this for our Christmas morning brunch.

                "reviewBody": "Excellent flavor from the combination of asparagus mushroom bacon and Swiss cheese. The generous use of heavy whipping cream in the egg mixture produces a fluffy (airy) custard. That was fine for a change of pace but prefer a slightly denser version. Thankfully followed several reviewer s suggestions to use only 1 cup heavy whipping cream (vs. 1-1/2 cups) and subbing milk for the difference. Because the flavor is so good I ll make this again but experiment with 1-1/2 cups half & half to better suit our tastes while eliminating about 90g fat/750 kcal from the entire quiche. A very good dish overall that can easily be customized to suit individual preferences.",
