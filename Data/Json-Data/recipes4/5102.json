I like to use Uncle Charley's sausages (which is a really good Pennsylvania sausage company), organic pasta sauce and sometimes, I'll throw in a couple drained cans of fire roasted tomatoes. You might want to taste your sauce before you serve it just in case it needs seasonings. Usually, the sausage (and the sauce--so use a good one!) gives the sauce all the flavor it needs. Great goulash. This also is a good sauce for lasagna.",

Since we love bell peppers (which you might have guessed), I used a mix of green, red, yellow and orange and probably used more than indicated.  I also subbed bow tie pasta that was already cooked and in the freezer, for the elbows.  I tweaked this just a little by adding some crushed red pepper for some zip, and a little dry white wine, because I couldn\u2019t help myself, lol!  Well, this was really good and a snap to make!  Hubs and I both really enjoyed it.  This is now my go-to recipe for sausage and peppers!  Love it!  Thank you korilynne for a terrific new recipe!",

I cooked it on low for about 6-1/2 hrs. and that was perfect. The sausage was so tender and the sauce so flavorful, that it needed nothing else added. I would've never thought to serve this over elbows, but it was a perfect match. Hubby took one bite and said 'this is delicious'! I would make this anytime, wether I'm busy or not...It's just great comfort food~YUM! Thanks, Korilynne for sharing this awesom recipe that I will be using often! :)",

I added some minced garlic to this (instead of the onion) and served over farfalle pasta. The recipe does make a lot but we'll take portions for lunch during the week and for leftovers later on.
