I teach a basic nutrition education program designed for limited resource families, and I was looking for a good, easy and inexpensive hoppin john recipe for New Year's.  Several groups have done this recipe, both as written and with additions of Chorizo sausage, Old Bay Seasoning, and leftover honey baked ham.  Even people who do not eat black-eyed peas rave about this recipe.  For those with problems with black-eyed peas, any other bean would work well.  It's a great recipe as is, or as a base for a very creative cook.  Thanks for such a great recipe.",

I pretty much followed the recipe, but added two stalks of celery,diced and one medium onion, chopped, and cooked them in with the saugage as a reviewed suggested. I used a 16 oz frozen pkg of black eyed peas, thawed, because we like fresh or frozen veggies much better than canned. I gave the peas about a 20 minute head start in the broth and water. I also added about a cup of thinly diced cooked ham, per a reviewer. Served with made-from-scratch cornbread. Yum!! This goes into the rotation file, for sure!!",

One of my cans of peas was with snaps but I figured a few pieces of green beans wouldn t hurt anything. I got the exact Sage sausage. I couldn t find the 6-ounce uncooked with seasoning packet long grain and wild rice. My store only had Rice-a-Roni called long grain and wild and it was a 4.3 ounce box. I love Rice-a-Roni but it isn t all rice. The Roni part is Vermicelli. I got Uncle Ben s already cooked long grain and wild rice in an 8.8-ounce package and I left out the 2 cups of water. Since I had varied anyway from the recipe I threw in some onions that I pre-cooked in the microwave. A must in any soup worth eating! I didn t need it to be that quick. I simmered in my Crock Pot on High for a few hours. My hoppin John soup was very tasty and I d make it again. It s mild though. If you want spicy a little garlic powder and hot sauce would blend well or use a spicier sausage. Good recipe that doesn t require exactness.",
