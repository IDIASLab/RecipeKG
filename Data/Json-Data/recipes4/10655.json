In theory the soup was good but with the weird flavor going on it sort of negated all the goodness. I tried to analyze what about it made it that way and I decided if I make this again I would omit the poultry seasoning and the sage. Also my chicken got a little overcooked. I cut the cayenne down to 1/4 of a teaspoon and it was the perfect amount of spice - not overpowering but still a little spicy.",

The combo of flavors makes it unique (if not a bit confusing). It hinted at more of a spicy Italian flavor to me so I added a teaspoon of sesame oil toward the end of cooking to give it more of an Asian taste. I enjoyed this soup and will likely make it again someday.",
