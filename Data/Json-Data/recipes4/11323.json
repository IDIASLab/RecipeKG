I browned the pork with about 2T chopped garlic (ok so we like garlic). Added no bell peppers but about twice the amount of green chiles. I only used about 1/2 c. of Sherry because we were out and left out the oregano. I never would have thought to use the cilantro and Sherry directly in the stew - what a wonderful taste - thank you Bianca!",
