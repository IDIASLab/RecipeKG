Also, you can just use a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, and if you want to save some calories, only use one teaspoon margarine rather than a tablespoon butter, and omit the oil. It will still taste great.",

It didn't say anywhere (nor in the reviews I read) that the tomatoes should be peeled but I would have much preferred it that way; that's just a personal preference thing though I guess. I also wish I'd taken my hand blender to it so that it would be more 'saucy' instead of chunky but again that's my preference. This was very quick and simple though so I would try it again with additional/different seasonings. One last comment maybe I just like my pasta particularly saucy but this wasn't even close to 4 servings for me. Make more if you have a big family or want some extra to freeze. Thanks for the recipe though it was a good start for me for making my first made-from-fresh-tomatoes sauce.",
