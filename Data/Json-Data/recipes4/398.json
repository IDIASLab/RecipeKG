I cook the zucchini separately from the rest of the veggies so they can have their own layer in the lasagna. \n2. I heavily seasoned all the veggies with several big shakes of basil and oregano, salt (several large pinches), pepper and garlic. I added ~5 cloves to kick it up. I also threw in a few shakes of crushed red pepper.\n3. I added garlic powder to the white/parmesan sauce. Butter would richen it up, but I wanted to try to keep it somewhat healthy.\n4. I added some tomato slices to the top of the pile, then smothered it in mozz + parm cheese. It adds a nice flavor, and is a nice visual touch in my opinion...\n5. I cook mine for about 45-50 minutes, uncovered, in order for the top to brown.",

However you have to simply know your own taste when preparing any foods. As for the kitchen novice no excuses! I am a 21 year old college student who is just learning how to cook! As for complaints about the spinach mixture you must like spinach enoungh to withstand the bitter taste. I love spinach but still used more than enough pepper to hide the taste. I will agree that this does take longer than listed. But the max time it took me was approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes. If you think about it it actually takes 60-90 mins to cook a store bought lasagna. Also I took the advice of some reviewers. I did add diced tomatoes added butter to the flour mixture to prevent the taste of flour reduced the amount of ricotta/cottage cheese used and increased the amount of parmesean. Now I ran short on veggies and cheese because the recipe does not state how many layers are suppose to be made. But the recipe still came out good having been my first time to cook lasagna and I do not mind eating what I have cooked for the next coupla days until it is gone!!!",

In addition I julienned the carrots and zucchini rather than slicing them with a mandoline. I also used 4 tablespoons of butter melting it in the saucepan before adding the flour. The flour has to cook a little with the butter to get rid of the \"flour-y\" flavor.",
