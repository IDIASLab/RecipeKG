This might sound weird but it was really tasty and gave the chili a little more volume. It gave me a great excuse to cook my red lentils! I would also say that (being born in Texas and having a deep love of spicy things) if you want a spicy dish you REALLY have to amp up the spice. I used about triple the chili powder and cayenne pepper and red pepper and black pepper than the recipe calls for. I tasted it after initially putting in my spices and couldn't taste anything but the tomato. Still the base of the recipe was a great idea; I'll certainly be cooking it again. Note: add a good crusty warm french bread for a real homey/happy dish!",
