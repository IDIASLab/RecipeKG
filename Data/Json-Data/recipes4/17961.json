After letting it rest in the fridge for a few days it formed into the pan fine, but I could tell it needed more liquid, so next time I will add more water while mixing.  This was a nice basic dough and the kids liked it a lot. I will be trying this again! Thanks for sharing. :)",

It was easy to work with too when I had to roll it out for the Stromboli. It held up to rolling although it split during baking as things expanded but that may have been my fault. (read: that was my fault all the way.) \nI think this one has everything I'm looking for is pizza dough. I will update when I actually make pizza with it. We'll see how it holds up on the grill.",
