The only other change I made is that instead of using garlic and red pepper flakes I used Huy Fong brand chili garlic sauce. I love that stuff in all of my ramen type soups. No doubt this was an unusual recipe but it is good. It is too salty though so I suggest using low sodium sauce and cutting back on it too. I did not use the optional Syrian zaatar so I cannot vouch for it made with that. I enjoyed this and am glad I finally broke down and gave it whirl.",
