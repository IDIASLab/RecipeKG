Was it still a good recipe or are you giving it a 1 because it didn't fill the dish? The other two. Did you do this recipe before changing the ingrediance, Or did you make the changes on the first attempt? Rating's aren't judged after changing ingrediances. As for not filling the dish.

Only change in the recipe was that I had no flake cereal so I used leftover Chex mix (with chocolate if you can believe that). Anyway it's tasty filling does not taste like tuna but maybe chicken. Great for a fall or winter evening. Love the peanut crunchy top but cashews could work definitely. Very satisfying.",
