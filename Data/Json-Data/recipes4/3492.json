This was the first time I had Hubs \"take it out to the grill\" and while there certainly was \"no mess \" I found I much prefer both the taste and texture of the vegetables when I good them as I usually do in a skillet on the stove. Cooked this way they took on some of the charcoal flavor which I didn't like. And for reasons I can't explain the vegetables just didn't have the complexity of flavor as when I cook them on the stove - perhaps it was because these were more or less steamed. It was nice to take the mess out of the kitchen so to speak but I think I'd rather have an extra pan to wash.",
