I did follow others' advice and doubled the amount of seasonings though. The second time I used skinless breasts because the thighs had so much oil and I thought it might be just as good with less fat. It wasn't bad at all, but not as good as with the thighs. This time I am going back to the thighs, but since there is a lot of \"juice\" on the cooking sheet with thighs, I am going to use a roasting pan instead, and add quartered baby golden potatoes and peeled baby winter carrots half way through the cooking time.  The spices are perfect for this.  About 15 minutes until done I am adding chopped sweet yellow onions. I will come back and post a photo and results if I am able to add that later. Update: Okay there wasn't much room left for the carrots and potatoes. I piled them up on one end of the pan after rolling them in the juices, and when the chicken timer went off I removed just the chicken.  I turned the oven up to 485 and roasted the veggies in the juice until done. It was delicious!",

I usually prefer grilled chicken, so when I read that this oven chicken would turn out crispy, and also rival the grill, I had to take a shot!!!\nMy girlfriend raved about this chicken, and said it was my best yet! The only adjustments that I made were I used 4 wings and 2 thighs (What i had on hand) for my small family. I also used garlic and onion powders instead of salts. I took someones suggestion to put the chicken directly on the rack, and let a baking sheet catch the drippings. This allowed the chicken to crisp on all sides.\nI definitely recommend this chicken. This chicken even got me some lovin' after the kiddo went to sleep.. WIN-WIN FOR ME :)",
