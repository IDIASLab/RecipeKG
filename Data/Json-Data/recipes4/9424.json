My family doesn't really care for the taste of mushrooms, and prefer the taste of the chicken to stand out more in our pot pies, so instead of cream of mushroom soup, I used cream of chicken soup, which also eliminated the need for bouillon, and used water in the quantity of 3/4 (three-quarters) of the empty soup can, which made for a thicker filling.  Also, for a much faster and easier prep, I used 2 cans (9.7 oz) of Swanson's Premium Chunk Chicken Breast in water.  I also added about half a cup of cooked diced potatos and a quarter-cup of sliced cooked carrots.  I also added half a teaspoon of salt and a couple of shakes of regular black pepper.  With all the filling ingredients already heated in the soup mixture, the only time it needs in the oven is long enough to brown the crust to your preference.  This was a great success in our family and disappears fast when I take it to work for pot luck events.  And it's so easy and delicious we stopped buying frozen chicken pot pies altogether.",

I did make a few changes: substituted cream of chicken soup for the mushroom, added a variety of vegetables - thawed corn, green beans and chopped carrots, as well as the peas,and added some spices - garlic powder, basil, oregano, sage and pepper. It's great for using up leftover frozen vegetables and leftover chicken. Thanks!",

The reason I didn't put it as a five star was because it was pretty liquidy. Next time I will try to use less water/bouillon mixture. It still tasted good just a personal preference. One thing that I did like about it was that it was very fast to make. The thing that took the longest was making the pie crust myself but if you used a premade one then it would go really fast.
