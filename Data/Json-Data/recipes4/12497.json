Well the food there is amazing and prepared by this awesome chef. They have arroz con pollo as one of the tapas and it is my favorite thing to get there. It is so full of flavor like authentic arroz con pollo. Well I found this recipe hoping to make it myself and suprisingly it was very similar. Same great flavor and everything except for this one had peas. I think the peas add a nice touch though. This is a very good recipe to make authentic arroz con pollo so I suggest everyone give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.",

I've been trying to duplicate the Arroz con Pollo that my friend's father made many years ago (he was Puerto Rican and made absolutely the best!). This wasn't quite it but it was delicious nonetheless. The only drawback was that with the chicken just sitting on top of the flavorful rice the chicken had no flavor. I recall that my friend's father simmered his on the stovetop with the chicken mixed in among the rice and flavorings so the chicken absorbed some flavor. I used frozen peas thawed instead of fresh peas. My husband asked what the \"crunchy things\" were - it was rice that needed more liquid so next time I'll increase the amount of chicken broth. The rice would even be great without the chicken! Just the right amount of spiciness. Thanks so much!",

I don't have a dutch oven so I let all the ingredients boil on the stove top and then added it to a casserole dish and then finally added the chicken back in. Also I used chicken broth instead of water at the end. Next time I will incorporate the peas pimentos and olives into the rice (just my prefernce) instead of putting it on top. Also next time I will marinate the chicken (maybe in Mojo) before browning it. The chicken was cooked perfectly but lacking some flavor. Overall it was really good!",

Hubby and brother-in-law (both fussy eaters) liked it too:) I made a few alterations to suit our tastes and it was exactly what I was hoping for. The alterations I made were: (1) I substituted boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of the skin-on chicken thighs because my husband and I don't like dark meat (therefore I put the chicken into the rice instead of on the top of it before baking as I didn't want it to dry out) and (2) I put a little less than half of the tomatoes called for and replaced with a proportionate amount of extra chicken broth so that the rice had enough liquid to cook. The full amount of the tomatoes called for looked like it would be too much... Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Was just the right amount of spicy (we like medium spicy food). Will make again and again.",
