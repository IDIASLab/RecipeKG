My chickens were quite a bit larger than 2.5 lbs (closer to 5 per I think) so I had to cook them quite a bit longer than instructed and at a lower temperature so I didn't kill the outside before the inside was ready - probably about 90 minutes at 350. This is also a great recipe for leftover chicken to use in other recipes as the flavors aren't too strong or distinctive to blend well with other things. Thanks!",

I made this with a small bird and whiel the meat wasn't done until the directions the bird came out fairly dry. If you are going to do a small bird make sure to tent the bird with foil and baste to keep it moister. This is what I should have done and will do the next time I use this recipe.",

Then I olive oiled the outside and added plenty of garlic and onion powder. During baking I basted. Very flavorful and the shallots and onions under the skin cooked so it was soft and sweet to eat.

I sprinkled about 5 or 6 cloves of garlic and a quatered onion around the chicken. I didn't have shallots so I just omitted them. I kept checking the chicken until it looked done (maybe 20 min) and while it was resting I reduced the liquid into a sauce (after spooning off the excess oily) Next time I'll try a whole chicken and see if the lemon is more pronounced.",
