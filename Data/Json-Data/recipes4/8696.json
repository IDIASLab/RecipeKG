Because I think one of the main flaws of this recipe was my fault and I hate when people ding a recipe for a change they made themselves. I used mild diced green chiles instead of jalapenos and I think it really needs the heat of something spicy. My version of this pizza probably only deserves a 2.5 stars. But we also didn't really like the alfredo sauce...I think a more traditional white pizza with olive oil and garlic would have been more to our taste. One other note is that we both thought a thin crust Boboli would have been better than the regular boboli crust we used. On the plus side the black beans are an interesting and delicious addition to a chicken pizza and the pizza looks very appetizing. Thanks!",

I used chopped chipotle peppers instead of the jalapenos (personal preference) and i used a shredded chesse mix that included swiss, mozarella and monterey jack. I also added some black pepper and parmesan cheese. It turned out great with the black beans sprinkled on top. I have since made the pizza a second time, spreading the crust with fat-free refried black beans (instead of the canned beans), spooning the alfredo sauce on top of the bean layer and then so on with the other toppings. The refried bean layer acts as a barrier to prevent the alfredo sauce from soaking too much into the pizza crust. My second attempt tasted just as delicious.",

Even without these things the pizza was better than I expected. Also because several other reviewers said one cup of Alfredo sauce was too much I just sort of spooned it on smoothing it all over the pizza crust. I probably ended up using about 1/2 cup maybe even less. I also sprinkled about 1/4 cup of fresh grated parmesan cheese on top. This could be done when you take the pizza out. Next time I also want to try what the crust package suggested which I noticed AFTER I put all the stuff on the pizza and THAT IS to spread some olive oil on the pizza crust to begin with - I think they said a tablespoon. What I like about pizza recipes is that obviously they're easy to play with and so you can satisfy your own taste.",

When I cooked the chicken breasts I added some garlic and cooked them in olive oil. After they finished cooking I cut them into strips added a bit of butter; added onions and bell peppers then I sauteed this mixture with the black beans. For the Alfredo sauce I used Portobello Mushroom Alfredo because I love mushrooms. I used just enough sauce to cover the crust; and sprinkled a bit of cheddar cheese on the top because I ran out of mozzarella. I will definitely make this recipe again!
