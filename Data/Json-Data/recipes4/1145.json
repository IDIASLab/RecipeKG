Here are my adjustments: 1 lb ground turkey browned with a clove of garlic, 1 cup chopped turkey pepperoni, 1 jar Ragu Italian Sausage flavored sauce, 1 can Italian Style stewed tomatoes (I blend smooth), 1 Tbsp brown sugar, 1 tsp Ital seasoning.  I cooked 2 pkgs of the frozen cheese tortellini then put into 13x9 pan.  I just didn't have time for the crockpot this particular day. Added some cheese, then poured over the sauce and mixed through and topped with more cheese.  Bake till cheese melts, which is only 5-10 min.  Fantastic! Better than any other Italian dish I have ever made.  And easy, too.",

First anytime I make a pasta recipe I always add onion and green pepper to the meat as I am browning it. I am not one whom like sausage so I used extra ground beef I also added a fair amount of pepperoni not too much to give it a little spicy kick. Instead of using original totellini I used garlic and herb chich I believe gave it a great taste. Also with any pasta recipe I added a little more italian spices gralic spice and some brown sugar. I don't add too much brown sugar it does give a smoother taste but the main reason for adding this to any pasta recipe it is counters the red sauce and keep the heartburn down this is always worked for me and my family since we do get heartburn easy so it's not as much for the taste. Overall I found that everyone enjoyed this recipe w/ all the changes. I served it was salad and bread.",

I did add some onions and green bell peppers when sauting the lb of italian sausage (I didn't use any hamburger), added some extra italian seasonings, and (thanks to \"Ravenmelle's\" advice) added just a little brown sugar - which I can see why it would reduce heartburn!!! I didn't see the point in slow cooking this so I mixed all in a 9x13 dish, covered with foil and baked for about 1.5hrs at 325 degrees. I then removed the foil, added the cheese(s) and baked for another 15 minutes (uncovered).  Sprinkled a little parmesan over each serving...Viola! Great recipe Tracy! My family gives you a standing ovation!",

I didn't use cheddar cheese as I really didn't think it paired well so instead I used shredded Parmesan. Wonderful served with a fresh garden salad and warm bread!",
