I have made twice adding extra gluten bread machine yeast and water honey/molassas (substituted honey for half the molassas) and butter (instead of shortening) (was Way too dry to form dough ball and properly knead without). Even with all these substitutions/additions it comes out fantastically! Wonderful crunchy crust very nice texture can slice very thinly without crumbling and makes great toast. This is my current favorite bread even though the dough is so heavy that during the kneading cycles of my Sunbeam machine I have to stand and hand turn the dough ball. When cooked it is not too heavy. It is perfect!",
