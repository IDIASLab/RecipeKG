I read the first review and doubled the sharp cheese (extra sharp) and, rather than American cheese, I added a can of cheddar cheese soup.  Because my client likes so much spice, I added a can (undrained to compensate for the extra cheese) of diced tomatoes with jalapenos, threw in a few shakes of red pepper flakes, and the result was Wonderful.  This is a great recipe!...creamy, thick, a little kick (more if you choose), and, hopefully, will get discovered.  Thank you so much!",

I did double the recipe other than that followed exactly. The boys and their girlfriends loved it it's not the same as oven mac and cheese but it was nice and creamy and we all enjoyed it. I stirred it about three times in the two hours and it was perfectly done in the time specified. I really liked it with just the green chilies and may try that next time omitting the tomatoes and onions at the end.",

I only had white American cheese so I cubed that up. We liked the mild spiciness to this recipe and it will be one that I make again. Thanks henrythe8thiam for sharing your recipe.",

(per several reviews) 1-10 oz can of DICED TOMATOES WITH GREEN CHILIS (drained) saving juice for later. DH does not like his food too spicy. Added green onion on the sides.... yes DH doesn't like them. Check slow cooker every half hour since my model is very old and very hot. Very creamy and so easy to make. This is not your old fashioned baked in the oven mac and cheese. This is a keeper for sure. Thank you Update...... I will try this with mexican style cheeses next time.",
