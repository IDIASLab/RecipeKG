After 20 minutes they still looked very light on the top so I continued to cook them checking them every 5 minutes but still nothing. Out of frustration I finally pulled them out of the oven and flipped one over. For whatever reason, all of the browning happens on the bottom which I found odd. Needless to say I almost ruined them. They were pretty dark on the bottom. I flipped them over so that the other side would brown and that worked nicely. The recipe doesn't specify but I recommend flipping them halfway through cook time to get that golden brown on both sides.",
