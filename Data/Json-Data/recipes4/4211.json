A nice twist on the standard - without the traditional pate de foie gras. This is a big hit with both my family and my guests. Choose flavorful mushrooms like criminis, portobellos or even porcinis or morels. For the wine, choose something rich you would actually drink - a good Shiraz or Pinotage. Perfect served with asparagus.",

I used a homemade Puff Pastry recipe from this site and skipped the wine sauce (it was part of a big meal already). I loved how you can do it in stages. I stopped after step 2 for about an hour while I cooked something else and again after step 3 for nearly three hours. Letting the steak sit in the pouches lets them sort of marinate in the mushroom wine juices which adds real flavor. Finally don't worry if your beef seems on the small side once it is topped with mushrooms and wrapped in dough it is definitely enough to satisfy big appetites!",

That said there were a couple of changes I had to make. First cooking time. After cooking my test-batch 15 minutes in the oven and letting rest for 5-minutes or so the steaks were blue in the center. Warm but raw. My second batch I cooked for an extra 5 minutes for a total of 20 minutes in the oven and after resting for 30-45 minutes (judging takes forever) they were perfect inside. So I recommend a longer cook time. Next the wine reduction sauce was a little too basic for me so I added in one cup of beef broth. The resulting sauce (I used a 2009 Ravenswood Zinfandel) complemented the steaks perfectly and two judges specifically mentioned the sauce was perfect. We already plan on making this again next month for when my in-laws visit. Yummy!",
