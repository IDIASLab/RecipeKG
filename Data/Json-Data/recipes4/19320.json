First, I used a flank steak and made my own marinade with lime juice, oj, fresh jalape\u00f1os, cilantro, vinegar,  olive oil, fresh garlic, s&p. I also subbed plain brown rice for the Spanish  rice suggested in the recipe. Trust me, there are plenty of flavors that you won\u2019t miss it. I wanted something a little cleaner/less sodium.  This dish would also be excellent with black beans, but the pintos were delicious.",
