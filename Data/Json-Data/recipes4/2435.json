The second time, I added all but 2 tbs of the sugar/spice mixture into the flour before mixing in the butter.  I then sprinkled the 2 tbs on top after scoring the shortbread.  I also baked in my brownie pan (9X10) instead of the 8X8 as suggested.  Great recipe, great spice mixture.  Don't omit the cardamon, even if you have to go out and buy some just for this recipe.  It is a very fragrant spice and really adds to the taste.",
