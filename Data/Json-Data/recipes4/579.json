I had some beautiful fresh asparagus, so I blanched it for a couple minutes rather than using frozen.Wonderful! I baked in an 11X7 dish so that the squares I served were nice and high. Beautiful presentation! If you change the pan size, remember to increase the baking time. My 11X7 took 43 minutes (28 at 425 degrees and 15 at 375 degrees) Halfway through I covered with foil to prevent excessive browning. It cuts better if you allow it to stand 10 minutes prior to serving as the recipe suggests.Great dish, Bettina!",

The one thing I would warn people about is that you have to serve it immediately.  It comes out of the oven all fluffy, tall, and steamy, but after 15 or 20 minutes it deflates and gets an unpleasant floury taste.   Reheating it will not restore its original light fluffy texture.  I used fresh asparagus precooked until just tender instead of the frozen, and I would guess that I used closer to 20 ounces than 10.  I will definitely serve this recipe again.",
