I kept the chicken breasts whole and coated in the dijon mixture, browned in the skillet, and then mixed in more dijon mixture along with about a 1/2 cup of chicken broth and a heaping spoonful of sour cream.  I did find the dijon mix to be a little tart and on the salty side (due to the mustard, I presume), and the broth and sour cream helped with that.  I finished cooking the chicken in this sauce and covered with foil so it wouldn't dry out.  I also mixed in some dried parsley at the end to help balance the flavors.  Served with white rice and green beans.  My boyfriend has already asked for it again - thanks the great, quick idea!",

(I wanted to use up a little 2 oz. bottle I got from a hotel and it measured out to probably less than 3 tbsp.). Also I cooked the dish for 18 minutes instead of 15 just to make sure the thick pieces of chicken were well-cooked. Even still they stayed juicy not at all dried-out. I'm not especially a fan of mustard flavors but the resulting dish was mildly mustardy and I thought the citrus flavors were mild too (my palate isn't discerning enough to tell the lime from the lemon). I didn't much notice the pepper and Creole-style seasonings when I ate it so I wish I'd put more in (I usually like strong flavors). I served this on a simple bed of white rice and it lasted me for about three meals. The flavor didn't wow me all that much but it was pretty good; and since the dish is so quick and easy to make I'll give the recipe overall a 4-star rating.",
