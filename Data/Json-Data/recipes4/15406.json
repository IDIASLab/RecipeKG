It was less of a soup consitency and more of a chicken pot pie consistency which is exactly what I was going for.  This made it very easy to travel with.  Also, I dont see how this would fit into a 9x9.  Even with 2 cups less of water I had to use a 9x13.  Everyone loved it and it went fast.  Thanks again.",

Just cook the chicken breasts with water just to cover, add celery, onion to the water and simmer slowly until done, maybe 40 minutes  Never season chicken you are simmering beforehand...waste of time.  Use chicken stock (which is unsalted) instead of water.  Remove chicken and dice/pull.  Strain stock, add salt/pepper and veges.  Low heat for another 10 minutes, then thicken and add biscuits to top... bake abt 15 minutes.",
