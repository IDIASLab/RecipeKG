I prepared the \"pockets\" in several different ways but found the easiest was to use 2 crescent rolls together flattened slightly into a rectangle add the mixture along the edge of one of the longer sides roll up and make sure seams and ends are sealed and bake for 20 minutes. My husband loved it but I thought it was missing a little something (might add a dash of hot sauce next time). Thanks for the recipe will be making it again.",
