Needs more parmesan!\" I was thrown off by the ingredient list saying \"cooked chicken\" and instructions saying \"bake til chicken is cooked through\" so I just ignored that and made everything as written w/ Costco's Kirkland canned chicken (I'm no can chicken snob; that Kirkland stuff is great!) The spaghetti noodles made this a little difficult to eat (i.e. hard to scoop/stab nummy ingredients all while twirling spaghetti) and 1 TB of parmesan was definitely not enough to sprinkle over the entire top so we added more when we served it. Made a TON but the leftovers were just as good if not better; when making again I'd use a different noodle reduce the mozzarella increase the parm and maybe saute the onions and peppers.",

I used 1/2 cup of cooked fresh mushrooms and I sauteed the onion and green pepper before adding it in. This is a useful recipe for cooked chicken and a few pantry items. I knocked it down a star because the recipe is too large for the usual casserole dish and way too large for my 10\" iron skillet. I will have enough leftover for another meal so it's all good. Thanks for the idea!",

Used turkey pepperoni because that's what we like. Left out the green pepper and black olives as I didn't have any. Used mini rigatoni for the pasta and added extra sauce and extra chicken and the mushrooms. Sprinkled shredded cheddar and monterey jack mix on top then shredded parmesan. My family loved it and would definitely make it again with the green pepper and olives. It was a great way to use leftover chicken! Also I baked it in a pottery pie plate so it looked pretty too.",

I used cavatappi pasta cut the tomato sauce in half used sweet red pepper instead of green used fresh mushrooms sauteed all vegetables before mixing in and added 1 c of kidney beans. I skipped the pepperoni and added some red pepper flakes. So I guess it is not really the same recipe that I am reviewing but my point is the recipe is flexible. I also mixed 1/2c. Parmesean cheese into the casserole and didn't put any on top. I cut the mozzerella in half. Overall it was good and I will definitely make other variations in the future.",
