After 10 minutes of trying to get the asparagus tender I had to remove ALL the asparagus and tenderize it in boiling water. At the price of asparagus I was not going to throw it away. My advice is to blanch the asparagus till tender then add it to the potatoe mixture. This took away some of the seasonings. I topped it with a 4 cheese Italian shredded cheese. I managed to salvage the dish. I rated it only 2 stars because it was slightly bland but too too much trouble. I have had better asparagus potato frittatas. I will NOT be making this again.",
