However, being one who is trained and worked in Food Safety and Temperture Monitoring, I would recommend cutting the baking time almost in half.  Pork Chops need only cook to 160 degrees for Medium and 170 for well done.  You take them out of the oven when they are 10 degrees from where you want them to be because there is carry over cooking time.  This will keep them juicy...I cooked mine 15 minutes less then suggested and they were still way over cooked (190 degrees when I took them out).  So, a definite keeper recipe, using fresh mushrooms, but only need to bake about 20-25 minutes!",

It makes alot of gravy so I made mashed potatoes with it.  All you need is a vegi.  Gravy was so good my bf ate his peas with the gravy on it (he does not like peas).

But with modifications I think this could easily be a 4 or 5. Here is what I now do. First I use a dutch oven for the whole thing so there is not bother with two pans. In the dutch oven when the butter is melted I add about 1/2 minced onion and a couple sprigs of thyme in addition to the garlic. After browning the pork chops I add the mushrooms cooking for a minute or two and then the sherry (the kind you drink not the cooking kind) to deglaze cooking on high until it's almost evaporated about 6 or so minutes. Then I add the beef broth bring to a new boil cover and stick in the oven. I only cook for 35 minutes covered and 10 minutes uncovered. DH and I both enjoy this and I tend to think pork chops are just \"okay.\"",

Put the chops back in warmed everything up and had it over brown rice. Amazing with adding pesto and bleu cheese can do!",
