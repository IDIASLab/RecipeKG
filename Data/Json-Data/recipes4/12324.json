I added chili-garlic paste (about 1 1/2T, Huy Fong brand) instead of the red pepper flakes as I'm afraid mine have lost their \"kick,\" and also tofu and leftover chicken.  This is truly a fantastic base, I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  One thing that particularly impressed me was that the texture is right.----Update---- If you don't have fresh ginger, I really wouldn't substitute powdered ginger for the fresh - it will significantly alter the \"bite\" fresh ginger brings. Jarred, minced ginger isn't bad - not great, but not bad.  What I do is buy a \"hand\" of ginger, wrap it in plastic wrap then a freezer bag and freeze it. You can just peel a little bit, grate or slice what you need, then back in the freezer.  It also grates very easily when frozen and keeps forever this way.",

Make the base with the liquids and seasonings, and before you add the vinegar and cornstarch to thicken it up, add your leftover noodles, rice, stir-fried veggies, chicken, beef, whatever.  It's amazing what works in this soup, so experiment around.  Then add thickener, heat through, and serve.  Puts a little variety into eating leftovers, so you don't really feel like you're eating leftovers.",

Not that I thought I had I just could not understand how neither my girlfriend or myself cared for this recipe given all the great reviews. We really scrutinized this and decided it was the red wine vinegar that gave it a funny taste. Also I felt that this dish was lacking some sort of a sweet component. I personally would not even consider making this again but my advice to anyone who really wants to try it is use white vinegar instead of red add brown sugar and maybe some teriyaki to add a bit of sweetness. Also I used to work in a restaurant that made a soup similar to this and their recipe added the corn starch mixture before the egg.",
