I would add more peas next time and not add them until the quinoa was almost cooked.  I prefer my peas bright green and just barely cooked. I might also saute the onion and garlic in the butter while the quinoa was roasting, just to get more flavor from the garlic and onions.  I thought this was very similar to risotto and might add shrimp next time to make it a full meal.  Yummy!",

It was very salty so that may have been from the veggie broth but the cheese was a little too strong for me. I added more quinoa that was cooked in plain water to balance it out and that did the trick. The next day for lunch we fried some up in a pan with an egg and put sliced tomatoes on top for a great brunch. Also it's good in a tortilla with chopped tomatoes and cucumber on it. This is such a versatile \"comfort food\" combination. Thanks!",
