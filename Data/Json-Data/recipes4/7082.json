To stop the chicken cooking faster on the bottom, and possibly overcooking before the rest of the bird is properly cooked, roll up aluminium foil make 5 ,o 6 balls (nearly golf ball size) and put them in the bottom of the cooker for the chicken to rest on. This allows the heat to circulate more completely around the chicken and cook more evenly. It also reduces clean-up time.",

Not having to have the oven on and heating the whole house (it's hot all the time in Florida) is great and the meat is delicious, moist, and fall apart tender. The stock is incredible and I'm able to make plenty of gravy which I thicken up a bit with a cornstarch slurry. The chicken smells amazing cooking and tastes amazing as well. I do cut back on both the salt and peppers using 2 t. salt, 1/2 t. cayenne, 1/2 t. white pepper and no black pepper and find it to be perfect for our taste. I do quarter an onion and roll the quarters in the seasoning then stuffed them into the cavity. Now when I buy whole chickens for this dish I clean and season then wrap well and freeze. When I know I'm going to make one I thaw it out in the refrigerator the day before. Works very well and good to know I can prep a few and freeze for when I want to make this meal. Good idea to make it in the slowcooker bhbitts, it's one of our favorites.",

                "reviewBody": "This was one of the best crock pot chicken recipes I've ever tasted. My chicken weighed 5-lbs and I made the rub as directed except reduced the salt to 2 teaspoons since I have to watch my salt intake. I didn't notice the rub was to be put on overnight, mine was only on for about 3 hours, and I lifted the skin and put rub under the skin also, but the flavor was still awesome. I took the advice of another review and put some sweet onion along with celery chunks in the cavity. I made a two inch stand under the chicken with some potato chunks to keep the meat from laying on the bottom. That worked out great and husband ate the potatoes, too greasy for me but he loved them. I think this kept the chicken from falling apart since it wasn't laying in the greasy stock.  I used a meat thermometer and cooked on low until the temp reached 170\u00b0, which took 8 hours exactly. My crock pot is old and cooks low when it says low, my newer larger one cooks much hotter, so I suggest checking the temperature to keep from over or under-cooking. This chicken was so tender, juicy and flavorful, it really did taste as good as the rotisserie chicken we buy from our favorite store...it was finger lickin' good.  I'm making this one again...so dang easy!",

I am not the cook in my house typically, but I put the spice rub on the chicken I got from the farmers market last night, and ran the slow cooker tonight. We have a 7 quart oval slow cooker and found about 5 hours on low was perfect (it ranges from 4-8 on the recipe, which I thought was a huge difference). Alternatively you can definitely smell when the chicken is ready to be checked.",
