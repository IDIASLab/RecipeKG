Once both sides were golden brown, I turned off the heat and let them cook completely.  If you have a glass covered saute pan, that helps to keep an eye on the livers without them spattering out of the pan.  I also dumped the leftover flour mixture into the leftover egg and milk mixture (add 1/2 tsp sugar and 1 tsp baking powder) and poured out small pancakes in the pan.  The garlic is REALLY strong in the pancakes, but they were a perfect accompaniment.  Both are delicious!",

I do remember her just dredging them in plain flour and frying. I want to assume it is because of the addition of spices to the flour and the egg/milk mixture is the reason why I liked how these tasted! I was reluctant to try liver again - but it has always been in the back of my mind to give it another chance because they are very good source of iron. I am glad I found this recipe cause I will definitely make these again. I ate them on toasted bread with lots of ketchup and pepper sauce (chicken liver sandwich - lol!) and I really enjoyed the garlic flavour in there. I used black pepper and cayenne in the flour as the pepper suggested in the recipe. Thanks for a new twist on an old \"not-so-favourite\" of mine. It has definitely made me change my mind about eating liver.",
