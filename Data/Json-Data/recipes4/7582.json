I used ricotta  cheese, and I make my own sauce using Papa John's Pizza Sauce recipe, which is sweet, spicy, and perfect for baking. To Answer Angelina, the reason this is so much better in some ways than lasagna is that the pasta is delicate (I used Angel Hair) and it absorbs every delicious drop of sauce. It is simple to prepare, too, and with another dollop of sauce over it, tastes better the next day. To each her own, and buono appetito!",
