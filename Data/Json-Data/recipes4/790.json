I used honey mustard instead of dijon and honey teriyaki barbecue sauce instead of plain teriyaki sauce. But I also used only 4 oz of mustard on 6 whole chicken breasts and I think that helped the mustard not overpower. The chicken came out so juicy. I lightly greased the bottom of the pan and my \"sauce\" didn't burn at all. And I used real bacon crumbled up to lessen the salt content. This was perfect with pesto rice. This was an overall great dish!",

We've even made it for casual dinner parties with great results. I follow the recipe to the letter except I substitute \"Dijonaise\" (dijon mustard with mayo) for the mustard. After trying it both ways I find that the Dijonaise creates jucier results. As to the bacon I start with fresh bacon and microwave it crispy and then crumble/chop to make the bits. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!",

I thought that 30 minutes at 400 was a little strange so I did the more standard 350 for one hour. The chicken turned out moist and perfectly cooked but the whole thing was VERY salty. I even used real bacon as was suggested and sweeter terriyaki sauce. I like strong flavors but this was just too much.",

It might have helped that I didn't use processed bacon bits but instead fried up three strips of bacon for the three chicken breasts I was using and chopped it up in the magic bullet. The processed bits are way more expensive and don't taste nearly as good as fresh bacon. This recipe is great because you don't need to measure just slop it all on and it will taste great.",
