We would cover the pan and cook until rice was tender and moist (approx. 1hr.)  GREAT recipe for last minute casserole w/ staples usually found on hand.",

I also seasoned the rice and water mixture with season salt and pepper. I covered it with tin foil and baked for 1 hour it came out perfect and moist. With these small changes my family loved it! Thanks so much for the great recipe!",

We always used double the amount of liquid to the measurement of rice (i.e. 1 cup of rice/2 cups liquid) I would take a 2-cup measuring cup add one full can of beef consumme and add water until the liquid equaled 2 cups. I would season lightly flour and brown the pork chops in the olive oil. In the baking dish I'd put the rice in first then add the liquid. I would layer the browned pork chops on top. It works best if the liquid JUST covers the pork chops. COVER WITH ALUMINUM FOIL. I would bake for 1-1/2 hours. I'd let it sit for 10 min. covered. This has always been a family favorite. I recently made it for a get together of friends using the 6 pork chops but doubling the rice and liquid (used 2 cans of consumme). Cooked for 2 hrs 15 min.",
