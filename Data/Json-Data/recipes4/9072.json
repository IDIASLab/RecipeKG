Also, I will use half and half instead of heavy cream.  It was a bit rich for me.  Also, I recommend using a dutch oven or something similar instead of a skillet, just so scooping the soup out is easier.  Can't wait to try it tomorrow as most soups are better on the second day.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.",

My only deviations were to use hot italian turkey sausage, half and half instead of cream, and Trader Joe's brand frozen Gorgonzola gnocchi since there was no plain gnocchi to be found there that day.  With the addition of the gorgonzola sauce in the gnocchi, I decided to leave out the parmesan for the first tasting, and found it wasn't needed.  This was absolutely delicious served with some crusty, buttered baguette.  I will have to try it one of these days exactly as directed, and I do expect it to be a little richer with full-fat ingredients.  But even with half and half and turkey sausage, this soup reminds me of Alfredo.  It is absolute comfort food and I look forward to making it again.",
