I ended up with a batter that I cooked on a hot griddle and ended up with pancakes.  But it was a great tuna casserole recipe! ;~}  \n\nHonestly, making a minor change to a recipe you're reviewing is one thing but most of these reviews have changed so many ingredients that I don't see why they bother to review it.  It kind of misses the point of posting recipes with specific ingredients, doesn't it?  This recipe is either good as it is, (or with a minor modification) or it isn't. ",

At the end of baking, I added pan toasted/buttered homemade crouton & pan toasted sliced almonds. I very much agree w/ the suggested extra can of tuna & more moisture (1/2-3/4 C. Milk or water). I prefer Cream of Mushroom.  I add a dash of this and that of my favorite spices.  It wasn't too creamy or too rich. My husband had cringed at the notion of Tuna Casserole at dinner. Once he tried it, he asked for seconds and THIRDS -- plus he's even requested it a few weeks later...Now, thats what I like-- a simple, basic recipe that is a family favorite!  My toddler also loved it.  Next time, I'll add some peas to complete this one dish meal.",

Thanks, Lindsay's roommate! \n\nHowever, other reviewers were right on when they suggested a few additions - like 1/2 to 3/4 cup milk, another can of tuna, and Velveeta cheese. \n\nAlso, if you are like me and are unsure how much macaroni to cook to get 3 cups cooked, I finally found a conversion for pasta on a cook's chart. According to that chart, 1 cup uncooked pasta will yield 2+ cups cooked. So, I am going to try 1 1/2 cups uncooked next time instead of just eyeballing it...despite the great fun that can be!",

I summarized others' advice for my liking so the renovated ingredients were:  2 cans of tuna, 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of cream of mushroom, garlic salt, frozen peas, about 1/2c mayo, black pepper, diced onions, a touch of whole milk, about 4 cups cooked macaroni, 1 c shredded cheese, and 1 c french friend onions. It was very good and i couldn't stop eating it for days (tasted good the next day too). Even though I thoroughly enjoyed it, I couldn't stop thinking it needed something else. The diced onions and french friend onions added a little crunch, but more was needed. My mom used to make a tuna casserole using leftover potato chips. I think that would be perfect to try in this next time - crush up the potato chips and mix in with the casserole. It adds a lightly crunchy potato. I'll also add a dash of tabasco sauce next time for a kick as was also suggested. I'm keeping this recipe - in the form I changed it to. :-) 3 stars because it's a base recipe but definitely needs kicks to it. Thanks, Andrea, for the start to many interesting creations from this!

I tasted it at that point, and found I was wanting a little bit of zing in it. So I added about 2/3 cup of mayo, and it turned out marvelous. I would recommend trying that for a bit of zip. I also omitted the onions since I didn't have any. But all said, this recipe is a great starting point, and probably would have been awesome if left alone too. I am pregnant, and think it's become one of my new cravings... (new addition: I love pickles with my tuna sandwiches, so I thought, why not? I threw in some dried dill weed, and it tastes marvelous!)",
