The only thing I do different is leave out the pasta and add fresh carrots, celery, potatos in quarters, and beef stew meat if I want meat added,I flour the meat and fry lightly the night before in olive oil.  Then throw it in the next morning I have also used this for just vegetable soup. Vegetable soup goes great with Midnight Cuban Sandwiches on this site.  I do have to find a good homemade beef broth in the future to cut back on the sodium level since my husband now has to watch his sodium intake.  Any suggestions let me know. Thanks for the post.",

Crusty bread is a must(we like to dip).",

The only changes I made was to use a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes as my kids don't like \"chunks\" of tomatoes in their foods. I also added another can of veggies. Next time I will use a \"smaller\" pasta as I thought the fusilli \"took over\" the soup. I will use alphabet pasta next time. This is a great tasting soup and will definately make again!",

I used low sodium beef broth a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes w/ paste 2 large thinly sliced carrots 1 chopped zucchini 1 chopped summer squash a bag of frozen green beans and substituted a handful of bow tie pasta and a handful of orzo for the fusili pasta. Three-quarters of the way through the cooking I was worried that the soup was way too thin but once the pasta was added it thickened up nicely. Ended up being very tasty and the squash/zucchini didn't get too mushy. Great leftover too.",
