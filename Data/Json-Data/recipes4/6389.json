The reason being that it added the creamy texture and thickening qualities without the added chicken or mushroom flavor. We always used nacho cheese Doritos too. It is really good that way. She always served it topped with diced tomatoes/onions and sour cream. Over the years I changed it a bit by adding a can of refried beans to the mix and using cheddar cheese when I did not have velveeta. Also I guess because of the evaporated milk we always cooked it for about 20 minutes and then added more cheese on top for about 5 more.",
