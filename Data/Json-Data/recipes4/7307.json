I added the red pepper flakes to the butter when it was still hot so it was really infused with the red pepper. If you don't like it too spicy - wait for your butter to slightly cool or use less red pepper flakes. I also used light butter. It worked perfectly and the flavor was great. I used fresh dill instead of dry because I had some to use up before it went bad and the fresh herbs were a great compliment to the fish.",
