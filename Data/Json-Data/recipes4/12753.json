Next time I will definitely double the sherry sauce because it is just that good. I also think the cooking times could be reduced depending on the thickness of the steak, preference for done-ness, and how thick you like your sauce. We had one steak that was probably 3 inches thick and the cooking time stated was perfect for a medium rare cook, which is what we like. Our thinner cut steaks were cooked to medium for that cook time. Definitely making again!!!",
