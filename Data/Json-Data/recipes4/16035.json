I did have to add more water and added a few more ice cubes to blend it to a consistency I like. I also used frozen black grapes. This recipe is very similar to the recipe in the Vitamix book my blender came with. I read somewhere that if you portion out and freeze cabbage it helps to 'temper' the bite so if you find the cabbage taste to be too much you may want to try freezing it. I picked a small young fresh green cabbage and maybe that helped.",

I followed the first reviewer's suggestions and cut the amount of cabbage by half. Glad I did that. I used all frozen fruit so I had to add 1/2 cup additional water to get it budge. I made 1/2 smoothie and got 1 serving. I used red cabbage which I have found uncooked does take on a strong flavor. I might have to try green cabbage in smoothies and see if that makes a difference. I was told by Vitamix consultant that cabbage was one of the vegetables that is undetectable in a smoothie. Must have been referring to the green variety.",
