Perfect both ways. I didn't have dressing so I just did 2 parts olive oil to like 1.5 parts balsamic vinegar and a couple cloves of minced garlic. This was pretty garlicky so I wouldn't suggest you doing that unless you don't have dressing:) Thanks for a truly great recipe this will be a staple this summer.",
