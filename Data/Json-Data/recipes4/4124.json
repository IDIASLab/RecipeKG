                "reviewBody": "Kumla has been a family tradition all my life. MY KUMLA SECRETS:  Secret #1: Yukon Gold potatoes are generally the best. Reds and Russets can be used but frequently contain more water than the Yukons. Secret #2: I special ordered a coarse head for the Kitchenaid grinder which I prefer over the standard grinder head. Grind the potatoes into a collander sitting inside a larger bowl to catch the potato water run-off. The better you drain the potatoes the better the Kumla but move fast. Secret #3: Substitue Onion Salt for salt. The addition of onion flavor to a potato dish is so obvious most people overlook it. If salt is your enemy, use granulated onion. You can also grind fresh onion or shallots into the potatoes but its difficult to get uniform distribution. Secret #4: Mix the baking powder into the flour in a mixing bowl while both are still dry to get uniform distribution. Secret #5: Add melted butter in a quantity you are comfortable with while mixing the batch. I use half a stick. Distribute it evenly. Secret #6: Use nitrile or other good quality sanitary gloves while mixing the dough with your hands. Sprinkle with the onion salt during this process. Secret #7: Use a wide enough pan for cooking to avoid having to \"stack\" the Kumla balls. Turn them with a slotted spoon during cooking for uniformity. Secret #8: Choose a cooking temperature that allows you to cover the Kumla for the first half hour without boiling over. It makes for a much better finished product. Trust me.",

I like to dip my hands in cold water before I make the potatoe ball. The piece of bacon in the center adds great flavor. The left overs are the best sliced and fried in a little bit of butter. Real comfort food. Always have loved it.",
