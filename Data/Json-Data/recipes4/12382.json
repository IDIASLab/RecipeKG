The great thing about this recipe is you can tailor it to your tastes without any problem.  I used a whole onion.  I added celery, shredded carrots as well as basil, oregano, marjoram, cayenne pepper and a few red pepper flakes.  As a final touch I added some thinly sliced smoked sauasge.  And as always, when I make any soup I use boxed chicken stock.  It is so much more flavorful than boullion or broth and not nearly as salty.  After simmering together for less than an hour it tasted like it had cooked all day.  So flavorful and wonderful!!! Will definitely make again.",

It truly is \"healing\" and not just for cold/flu season, but this could also greatly benefit those with certain digestive conditions. (Cabbage being excellent for stomach ulcers, for one thing.) I found the amount of cabbage in the original recipe to be just right and did not add extra as other reviewers did. I did however, increase the onion to a whole medium-sized onion instead of just half, and used 4 garlic cloves instead of 2. I also added a little Italian seasoning to it, a pinch of cayenne, and a little black pepper.",

Added water, all bullion, 2 stalks of celery, 20 baby carrots cut up, 1 potatoe, tom. w/ juice in can, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, and 1/2 tsp italian seasoning.  i thought the amount of cabbage called for was PERFECT!!!  I did have to add an additional 1 1/2c of water thr. out cooking.   Thank you for the great easy recipe!!!  I'm guessing left overs will be wonderful tommorow after the flavors have intensified!!!  Thanks for sharing!!  This will rock this summer when i have those left over veggies from the garden i'm not sure what to do with!!!!!  My boyfriend loved it as well which is a big plus as he's not a huge veggie guy 8 - )",

The other option is serving over some leftover  shredded chicken. It may just be soup, but with a little thought the nutritional value is excellent.\r\n\r\nI found this recipe to be perfect as written. It is not supposed to be a thick soup, but a consume based one. I think there is confusion about how much cabbage to add because they do vary in size alot.  Maybe trying to pin down a weight (like 1/2 of a 2 lb head) would give a little more guidance. Thanks for a great recipe!",
