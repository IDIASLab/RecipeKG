The only changes I had to make was to use regular sandwich bread because I didn't have any sub rolls on hand and I had to use dried basil because I didn't have any fresh on hand. I'm eager to try this sandwich with the fresh basil as I know it will give such a wonderful fresh burst of flavor. I used regular mayo instead of light which was what I had on hand. The first time I made it I used blue cheese crumbles AND blue cheese dressing... but that makes for very pungent blue cheese flavor so I wouldn't recommend that. Use blue cheese dressing only if you don't have the blue cheese crumbles. Otherwise use blue cheese crumbles and mayo. Delicious wonderful combination of flavors. I also pan seared my roast beef (don't really care for it cold out of the fridge). You won't be disappointed with this one! Thanks for sharing!",

Great sandwich and easy to put together quickly.",
