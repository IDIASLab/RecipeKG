I always pour canned beans in a sieve or colander and rinse well under running water; this step does away with the \"gas problem\" a lot of people experience after eating beans. Works like a charm! I then use a can of beef or chicken broth to replace the liquid. Also, I fry the onions until soft and almost browned, add the garlic and saute for just 15 - 20 seconds more, then add the broth and simmer until ready to serve, at which time you would add the cilantro. This was a method that a Cuban neighbor taught me for an even tastier dish.",

I think 5 minutes is not enough, IMHO.  The only variation I made to the recipe was adding some fresh ground black pepper along with the salt.  I used this dish to create the best bean burritos I\u2019ve ever tasted - 1/4 cup \"best black beans\" + 1/4 cup shredded cheese + 2 Tbs. fresh salsa wrapped up in a flour tortilla, then heated in a skillet (or microwave if you just can\u2019t wait).  I then topped it off with some green onions and sour cream.  Mmmm.  Perfect for vegetarians, too.",

Sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil until soft and browned.  Drained the beans and added them to the pot with about 3/4 can of chicken broth.  Added the cayenne pepper and 1/4 tsp of cumin.  Salted and peppered.  Simmered for about 20 minutes or until most of the liquid has evaporated.  Dress with about 1 tsp of lime juice.  Its delicious!!!  I also threw in about 1/2 cup of roasted corn from Trader Joe's towards the end which gave it a nice textural interest.  \nI omitted the cilantro completely because I'm not a fan of cilantro but added the cumin for more flavor and it turned out amazing!  Served with steak fajitas.",
