Also the ground up filling was just so unappetizing it may have biased me against the dish. But I didn't like the texture of baby food inside the dough pocket either. The dough was fine - that's why I gave the recipe 2 stars. I've made it again with shredded chicken BBQ sauce and cheddar cheese inside and they were good. It was a texture and onion issue for me - if those things don't bother you it's a good recipe although one that's a fair amount of work.",
