The texture is thick and foamy but very light on the palate so it takes a little getting used to. You expect something more dense from the look of it but what you get is ethereal when you take a spoonful. Give it a try. Oh a hint chill your bowl and beaters or whip with your evap. Will give you even more volume.",

With the product I ended up with there is NO way that this could ever be put into a mold. I also use 2% evap milk to save on calories. You can use any kind of jello you like.

I garnished them w/ a couple of fresh raspberries & rose petals (I only use organic products on my roses). The rest of the recipe I poured into a mold & we had it the following day. Lovely recipe...thansk Apple Jacks! Next time I may try subbing juice or even wine for the water to add extra flavor.",
