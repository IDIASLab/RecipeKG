So I really had to improvise to keep them stacked...But for my kids I just did the one layer(puff pastry creme mix strawberries a dab of creme mix puff pastry powdered sugar with a touch of whip cream and half a strawberry) If you could see all of my kids' faces while they were eating you would totally understand how HUGE of a hysterical funny mess they made while trying to eat them...however my kids came back for seconds because they enjoyed this light and airy treat.

It's perfectly wonderful as is but we have also experimented a bit preferring using true whipped cream (from heavy whipping cream) as opposed to the cool whip. We occasionally added a tablespoon of Tang orange drink powder to the pudding mixture or we grated some orange zest into the pudding mixture for added interest. The beauty of this recipe is that it appeals to kids and grownups alike and you can use whatever berries you have on hand. For July 4th blueberries and strawberries make a beautiful combination with the pudding and puff pastry. Amazing recipe! It has truly bumped out my favorite trifle recipe as our family's most treasured dessert!",
