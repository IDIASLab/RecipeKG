                "reviewBody": "Very close to the true uzbek recipe (I'm originally from Uzbekistan).\nAgree with previous reviewers abour julienned carrots. Another thing we do differently: put raw garlic on top the rice (squeeze it in the rice in the center) before covering everything with water. Pour water over a tablespoon or wooden spatula to ensure even distribution over rice (to avoid making large holes in the rice). Cover, and when it starts boiling remove the cover to let water evaporate. Then cover again until rice is ready. Cook on slow heat.\nAlso, we use round rice rather than long rice but in any case avoid sticky rice.\nThe main key to the true uzbek plov: spices. In addition to what you already mention you need turmerick (it gives plov its golden colour), carum seeds (or caraway seeds), cumin can be used regular and black cumin for more flavor, some use paprika. \nComment to other reviews:\nCranberries is a poor substitute to barberries - you need something very sour.\nThere is no butter in the plov.\nServe with shikarop: a salad with finally sliced (almost shredded) tomatos, shredded sweet onions, oil, salt, pepper, cilantro, and paprika. Enjoy!",

Also I add a little butter right before I throw in the rice. It really improves the flavor. this is a classically rich dish so the flavor of butter takes it a long way. I thinly slice my carrots... this is the traditional way and does a lot for the texture. If you don't like lamb cut up chuck roast will do or any marbelized meat.",
