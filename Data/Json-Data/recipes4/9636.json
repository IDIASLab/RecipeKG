I had 2 frozen turkey legs that I partially cooked on the stove with the 4 cups of water and some chicken bouillon.  While that was cooking, I chopped the carrots, celery, and onion and put them in a crockpot.  I added the turkey legs (whole) and the broth and let that cook on high for a few hours.  I then cut the meat off the bone and added it back to the crockpot along with frozen corn and a bag of frozen broccoli and cauliflower and some rice.  Just before serving, I added the can of cream of chicken soup, but no cheese.  My kids loved it and it is definitely a comfort food type of soup that I will make again.",

Used 3 turkey thighs filled a big pot with water & a cup of chicken broth waited for the water to boil then put in my diced potatoes cut up veggies & the 3 turkey thighs. Bring water down to a simmer cover with lid and don't touch for 30 mins. I poured the water/chicken broth into a gravy strainer and poured 4 cups of skimmed liquid into my croc pot. Put 1 can each Cream of Chicken & Cheddar soup substitute for cubed cheese & mixed it with a wire whip. Cut my turkey to mouth size bites & put in the croc. Added a half bag of Green Giant frozen mixed veggies set on low for 4 hours. Didn't add the onions for no particular reason will add next time. By far the most tender turkey I have ever had in soup. Incredible. Snowin' like mad here Massachusetts & sittin' back with a hot & hearty soup!!! TY Melody!!!!!",

Unfortunately I wanted to make a big pot and used over 2 qts of water and my huge leftover turkey. Added 3 cans chicken broth to get some flavor. Then my mistake.. I hate celery so I diced it in my food processor. That was alright but I also diced my carrots and onions in there. End result (after 3 cans cream of chicken / 1 can cream of celery/ half pound of velveeta / half lb cheddar /some parmesan and romano and mounds of seasoning) was basically a slightly cheesy creamy broth with mini chunks of potato and a few veggies. (Oh yeah I ended up using 1 lb mixed frozen and 1 lb green beans.) I doubt I'll do this again I prefer my usual entirely homemade (i.e. no cans of soup and processed cheese!) turkey lentil and barley soup but if I did I promise to follow the recipe!! Thanks anyway.
