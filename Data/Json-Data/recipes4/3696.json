My hubby proclaimed it was \"a hit\" after our kids consumed most of it (my 14 yr old had triple helpings).  I didn't really make any changes, just a few necessary ones.  I didn't have saltines, so I used bread crumbs.  Also, I had quite a bit of left-over tomato sauce (had the 15 oz size can rather 8 oz), so I mixed half tom. sauce with a good amount of catchup and added another Tbs of corn syrup to match.  Ultimately, I suspect the quantities added up to the original recipe as I didn't use the entire glaze.  Also, I baked until the meat reached 155 or so degrees for about 40 minutes (glazed after 30 minutes) and let rest for an additional 10 minutes.  Came out perfectly moist.  Served this with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.  Family was fully satisfied. ",

                "reviewBody": "This wasn't a bad meatloaf recipe in and of itself, but the glaze just was not my cup of tea. The corn syrup gave the glaze an almost gummy texture, and the sweetness just overpowered the savory flavors of the meat loaf.  Also, while the loaf was seasoned pretty well, the crackers would need to be crushed to a virtual powder, as we had several mushy spots that pretty much ruined the texture of the loaf. I would recommend using 1/2 cup of plain ground quick oats (oatmeal, in other words, make sure they're the plain kind, not flavored), as they work just as well as a binder for the loaf, you don't end up with a salt overload, and the oats don't lump together to cause mushy bits. Overall, a solid recipe that, for me, required some tweaking. I also added some freshly ground pepper and would recommend adding a pinch of sea salt if you don't use the saltines as a binder.",

Great meatloaf! I made a few substitutions and added some garlic and worchestershire sauce. Instead of regular tomato sauce, I used tomato sauce seasoned for meatloaf. The topping, I used regular mustard and honey, and did not add the thyme. I will be making again! For a side, try the Sweet and Savory Kale recipe.",
