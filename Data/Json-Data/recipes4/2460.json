I will definitely make this again, but when I do I will definitely NOT be putting the dry bread cubes in the bottom of the crockpot. They stayed dry, and that was not really appetizing. The top part is quite tasty, though.   I will also be softening the onion and celery in some butter before adding them, because they stayed too crunchy for my taste.   It also has to be said that this thing looks unappetizing as all get out, but it really does taste surprisingly good, cranberries and all. Also, serve it with a light veggie or salad,  because it is HEAVY!",

I had to use my 5 qt. pot. The last hour of cooking I needed to add about 1/2 can of chicken broth and stir as the mix was too dry; the bottom bread was dry.(could be my altitude?)

Once I got them out the rest was good. I even added the cranberry and it was just about the right amount of sweetness to go with the savory of the sage. I also added summer savory to it. The next time I make it I will not put the dry bread cubes at the bottom. I will make double the match of the stuffing mixture and put someo n the bottom and some on the top. I think that will fix the dryness for me (I HATE dry food). With a few fixes it might be a 5 star.",
