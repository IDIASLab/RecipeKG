I recommend using frozen butter. I also recommend holding back some of the salt and sprinkling flake salt before cooking. If you like more spice, creole seasoning is a great addition too.",

I made them with my four year old and she loved using the cookie cutter to cut them out. Our whole family loves the result I predict that we will be making these regularly.",
