If you are making a 8 or 10 serving batch I would cut the eggs to 10. The first time I made this I noticed that it was a little soupy when I took it out of the frig so I drained about 2 eggs worth (it still came out wonderful!). The first time I used blueberries. After I sprinkled the cream cheese and blueberries over the first layer I sprinkled sugar over everything. This time I am using frozen strawberries (which have sugar added) so I didn't add sugar. I added about 2 tablespoons of cinnamon and 2 tablespoons of vanilla to the egg and milk wash before I poured it. Keep maple syrup handy for those pancake lovers or there is a recipe for blueberry syrup on one of the other french toast recipes!",

That was soooo delicious and I bet that would add the sweetness/flavor that a lot of you think is missing. The lady also said she only used 1 brick of cream cheese.
