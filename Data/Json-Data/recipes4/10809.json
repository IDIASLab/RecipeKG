They were great with black beans and rice sour cream lettuce and shredded cheese. Yummy! UPDATE: Almost two years later I made it again. I changed the rating from four to five stars. You HAVE to add more water 1 Tbsp. at a time until you have a good moist (but not wet) dough. Knead it to work the gluten. When the dough is elastic and stretchy (if it crumbles add more water!) divide and let rest. This also lets the gluten rest so you can roll them out (I just use my counter--no waxed paper). I divided the dough into 16 balls but used 1 1/2 balls for each wrap. As soon as you remove each cooked wrap from the skillet place it in a plastic ziplock bag to steam and soften. While the wraps don't have a lot of flavor by themselves they are great filled! This recipe is definately a keeper.",

Didn't have any wax paper so I floured my board & rolling pin & rolled them out thin. If one gets stiff let it sit while you do another. Really good with another recipe from this site for Make Ahead Lunch Wraps. Be careful that you use a SEASONED griddle ungreased... otherwise you'll destroy your pan with the flour burning. Great recipe low fat & healthy why buy?? You KNOW what's in these!",

They are not as soft as store bought but definitely rollable. If you have about 2 free hours I would recomend trying them:)",

I love how easy they are to make but you do have to watch them very closely once they are on the stove. Next time I am going to make tortilla chips with them by seasoning them with sea salt and slicing them into wedges and baking them on a cookie sheet after frying them. I have done that before with store bought tortillas. You can also use cinnamon and sugar instead of sea salt they are good with fruit salsa. These might be hard to get use to if you are not used to eating whole wheat but in our family that is the only thing we eat.",
