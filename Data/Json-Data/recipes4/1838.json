Instead of dotted butter, I melted butter and added lemon juice, garlic & onion powder, parsley, old bay, and pepper.  I drizzled this over the fish.  The last 10 minutes, I sprinkled some bread crumbs on top.  It was great.  Next time I'll top it was parmesan cheese. Thanks so much. This is a great recipe that you can really experiment with.",

I recommend two changes to the recipe: 1. instead of lemon slices drizzle freshly-squeezed lemon juice over the fish (and over your choice of fresh or frozen vegetables); 2. add an additonal spice/herb to the Old Bay and garlic salt in order to zip up the flavor...which otherwise will be on the bland side. I will make this dish again and add paprika. Tilapia is a delightful fish: versatile affordable and delicious. This is a great recipe to get more seafood into your diet without fuss.

I decided to surprise her because she has always said that if I were to cook fish that it would taste better than in restaurants. Well, I had no clue how to start, so I used this recipe as a base and it was amazing. The differences I made were that I added lime juice instead of lemon slices, and that I added garlic powder, salt, black pepper, cayun, and a little bit of bread crumbs. I then served it with garlic mashed potatoes and wild rice. This recipe is now my favorite and easiest to make.",

This would be a good dish for someone who is either new to eating fish, or is not usually a fish lover,  as tilapia is very mild.  For those of us who love fish, it's very good.\n\nI took suggestions from other reviews and made the following small changes:  used frozen but slightly thawed fish and veggies, coated the fish with just a little olive oil and butter, added fresh garlic, and used recommended spices liberally and added a couple of other spices as well.  Lastly, I sprinkled bread crumbs on the fish for the last ten minutes of cooking, and left the dish uncovered for that length of time as well.  Very tasty.",
