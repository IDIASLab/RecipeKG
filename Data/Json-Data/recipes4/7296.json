I scaled down the recipe to 4 servings (since I only had 1lb of ground chicken and 1 can of Rotel), but followed the recipe exactly.  Super easy to make, very healthy, high protein and definitely hits the spot. I'm always looking for new ways to prepare ground chicken. I'll be making this one often. I suggest adding salt and pepper while browning the meat to really bring out the flavors.  For those saying it's bland...try salt! It does wonders. I can't wait to have this for lunch tomorrow! Yum!  EDITED TO ADD: Yup, just as delish the next day! I'm thinking this would be excelled stuffed into a pita, or as a filling for stuffed peppers.",
