After everything was cooked I felt it still needed something so I added garam masala - wow!  It tasted amazing!  I cooked off some of the water to thicken it and served over basmati rice (that was cooked with butter, minced garlic, and tumeric).  This tasted wonderful.  I love how full of veggies it is and how different it is from the normal stews out there.  Definitely keeping this one in my recipe box.  \n(personal side note: use the large cast iron pot next time, this made a lot)",

Initially I was a bit skeptical about the small amount of liquid going into such a large pot of vegies and meat, but the vegies \"melted\" down nicely. It had a good flavor, and wasn't overly complicated to make. Hubby liked it (had seconds), and my teenage son loved it. He was actually upset there wasn't more.",

Overall it was tasty and healthy served over some white rice. I will probably be making this again when I'm looking for something different.",
