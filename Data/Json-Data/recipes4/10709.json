The fruit topping is easy and quite tasty although you had better be in the mood for something sweet - whew! I accidentally added 1 teaspoon of orange rind to the sauce but it just made it even fruitier. All in all a delicious meal that thoroughly satisfies your sweet tooth.",

I also agree with another reviewer pineapple chunks would be better than crushed pineapple. I toasted sliced almonds and topped the toast with them while cooking so that they would adhere to the toast. I also sprinkled with some shredded coconut lastly. I feel that adding a bit of coconut extract to the egg mixture would have been better. Because I wanted a truly \"tropical\" tasting french toast I topped the finished toast with a few slices of banana before serving. On the side a few slices of mango to seal the deal! All of the elements were there yet somehow it just didn't \"wow\" me. Maybe it was the bread? I feel my version needs a bit more tweaking to make it the tropical french toast I was looking for when I searched for this recipe. Yet the base of this recipe is lacking.",
