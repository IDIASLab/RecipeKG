The only changes I made were to top with pecans instead of walnuts, cut the butter in half during the mashing step, and omitted the melted butter at the end. I suspected that all that butter wasn't totally necessary and I was right (at least for our tastes). Don't skip roasting the jalapeno, it gives the potatoes such a great flavor. Thanks!",

I've gotten really tired of the typical sweet potato dishes that are overly sweet and mixed with brown sugar, spices, etc.  It's fine for Thanksgiving, but when it comes to summer, I want something with a fresh and bright flavor. This recipe totally fits the bill!  I admit, I was running short on time, so I microwaved the potatoes on high for 6 minutes. I used the juice of one small orange. I mashed everything together and that was it. Time to dig in!  I didn't bother drizzling the extra butter over top and baking in the oven.  I also didn't use the walnut pieces, only because I didn't have any, but I'm sure it's quite tasty! The jalapeno really mellows as it roasts, so don't be afraid of using the whole pepper. Next time I will use two!  I will also double the recipe. This is a keeper!",
