I used to eat jigae (stew) often when I lived at home with my grandmother and mom and this recipe tastes a lot like theirs! I followed the recipe and used all ingredients except for the potatoes. I did add a few more things though and that is a 1/2 lb pork tenderloin and about a cup of leftover kimchi I had on hand. Instead of the garlic paste I just used minced garlic. I sauteed the onion and garlic with a tbsp of vegetable oil and I chopped the pork into very thin and small pieces and added that to the pot. After the pork browned I threw in the rest of the ingredients (including the kimchi) except for the tofu. Instead of measuring I went more by taste though I'm sure I used a lot more denjang than what the recipe calls for. I let it boil and as soon as the zucchini got soft I added the tofu and let it cook for just a couple of more minutes. I served with some white rice and it was just wonderful!! My husband also enjoyed it very much and went back for seconds.",
