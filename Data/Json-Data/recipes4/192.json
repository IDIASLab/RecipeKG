I would definitly make this again and perhaps do a combination of russet and sweet potaotes.",

The first time I cooked it at 425 in a shallow pan and they still got a little burned.  When I made this again and I combined the soup mix and oil a few hours ahead of time so the onions would soften.  I baked it in a smaller pan covered with foil for 45 minutes at 350 (I was also making a pork roast).  Then took off the foil for another 30 minutes til the roast was done... they came out much better, nicely caramelized and the onion flavor wasn't overpowering :)",
