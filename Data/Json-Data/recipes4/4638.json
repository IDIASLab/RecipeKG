It did end up taking a lot more than 20 minutes of prep time though! My changes were to thicken with cornstarch instead of flour and like others I added more and different vegetables. I did not have cream so I substituted. What I did to make it not so bland was to brown some minced garlic in the butter and I used dried chopped onion. Additionally I didn't have any crackers on hand but I did have some leftover cornbread from the previous morning so I crumbled that and it worked out. Next time I might consider browning fresh chopped onion with the garlic possibly using a dash of chili powder and I might throw in a can of beans to up the protein content. I will not skip the cream next time as I think the richness will increase the flavor. Definitely sticking with the cornbread topping and may throw a dash of Parmesan on top too.
