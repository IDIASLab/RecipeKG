It was yummy but it was a bit flavorless...too much effort for it to be so flavorless. Also I will not being making with with the white bread...it came out in big soggy chunks that pretty much ruined it! I am glad that I only used 1/2 loaf and substituted the rest with Pepperidge Farm Seasoned Bread Crumbs. I will make it again but with no white bread at all and all PFSBC. And of course tweak the seasonings so that I can get a better flavor. It was a hit with my family. But I do not recommend using white bread at all!",
