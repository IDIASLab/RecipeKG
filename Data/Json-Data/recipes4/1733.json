However I'm glad I blended everything together with my immersion blender; don't think I would have liked the appearance of the individual textures. I did sprinkle lime juice over the cut avocado to keep the bright color and I added fresh cilantro onion powder and garlic powder. I spread the dip on a flour tortilla with diced tomato and shredded lettuce for a quick and delicious wrap.",
