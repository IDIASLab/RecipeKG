The most difficult part of making this was stopping at the liquor store to pick up cheap bourbon I would be willing to part with in a dip. I served this with crackers and sourdough toast points and we found we enjoyed the toast points most. I was hoping for leftovers I could use to make a banging grilled cheese but our guests saw to it that that didn't happen. This will be an entertaining staple at the LTH house (you have to use up cheap bourbon somehow...). THANKS for the recipe McCormicks!",

Maybe try again with half the sour cream and half the mayo. Throw diced jalape\u00f1os in with the onion some garlic double the bourbon....then perhaps there can be something worth dipping into.",
