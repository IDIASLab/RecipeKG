It stayed together, and was awesome!",

Line the bottom of your loaf pan with bread. (Two pieces usually does it) Place the meatloaf on top and cook per recipe. The bread soaks up the grease and peels off easily, leaving a beautifully moist yet grease free meatloaf! Bon Appetite!",

I am Peruvian and my husband is Bahamian and in Peru we do not make meatloaf as part of our day to day menu. Anyway... I picked this recipe as the ingredients sounded like a generic meatloaf but I made a few changes: I did not have the onion soup so did not put it in I replaced it by 1/4 cup of men-si (tau-si) sauce (you can find it in Asian foodstores). I added 2 eggs and cut the milk in half. We do not have mild pork sausages here in Peru so I replaced it by Argentinian chorizos. I did not cover it with ketchup before baking it. I left the rest just as it said on the recipe and it turned out delicious. My husband said it was the best meatloaf he has ever tried!",

This came the closest to her recipe that I found. It turned out great and stayed moist and together. I had to alter it to feed 8 picky people however. I used 3 lbs of beef with 1 lb of ground pork sausage. Some weren't fans of onions so I replaced the raw onions with about 8 baby portabella mushrooms. I also used red and green bell peppers. I mixed some butter crackers with salted crackers. To help with the size I kept the milk the same but added 2 eggs. I still used just one dry onion soup mix. I waited to add the ketchup until the last 20 minutes. I didn't have sage so I just left it out. I ended up using 2 loaf pans. My husband was in love. He ate it hot on day 1 and ate cold meatloaf sandwiches on day 2. Everyone else ate it even my 2 year old nephew. I served it with green bean casserole cheddar and bacon baked potato halves and baked rolls. It was surprisingly quick to prepare and I was ecstatic with the result.",

I think the only thing i did different was that i grated the onion bell pepper and celery. I dont have a food processor and i dont like to bite into the pieces of vegetables so i grated them instead. I also used just ground beef and i think i made more than 2 pounds because it didnt fit in my loaf pan. Luckily i had a larger aluminum one that it fit perfect in. I also had to increase cooking time because mine wasnt done in 1 1/2 hours. This recipe is definately a keeper!",
