I added some cream of mushroom soup and cheese mainly because I wanted to stretch it out to feed a crowd. I also sprinkled it with paprika when it came out to make it pretty. I reduced the milk a bit I think as I was just eyeballing it but that's what great about this recipe. It's eyballity (it also inspires completely fictional words.) Overall a good recipe - will make again. Thanks!",

I would like to suggest a different cooking method for the squash that in MHO takes it up a huge notch. I always saut\u00e9 my sliced squash and diced onions in a butter/olive oil mixture. I saute the squash covered until it starts to soften then I take the cover off and let all the squash liquid evaporate until it is softened and caramelized. The caramelized squash and onion are so flavorable. I would say this method takes 20-25 minutes instead of the 10 minute boil but what a flavor enhancement!! Hope you will give it a try!!",
