I changed the raisins and almonds to peas and carrots because I had just had a bad experience with both (kidney stone anyone???) and we need our veggies!  I added 1/2 cup more chicken broth to help cook the carrots and added more curry per other reviews.  Also used oil instead of butter.  Fantastic taste - I really like the subtle allspice flavor.  Ate this with some tilapia - DELISH.",

To start with, I used a 1/8 cup more butter, added garlic, carrots and lentils to the onions as they sauteed and more chicken stock than the recipe called for, probably about a cup more to help cook the lentils and carrots.  I left out the raisins and almonds. \nI also added a cup of coconut milk and MORE THAN DOUBLED all of the spices.  I used it as a main dish with some naan bread and raita and it was SO hearty and filling.",
