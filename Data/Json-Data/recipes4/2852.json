When you read it, you might think it is too involved... but really, you just let it sit in the warm water, checking the temp every now and then.  It actually does its own work - kind of like letting bread dough rise.  I use the time to get other things done around the house. Don't be scared off - it's really pretty easy.",

I follow the directions, but once it hits 115 degrees and I've added the live cultures, I pour it in jars, and set on a heating pad on low, with the jar wrapped in a towel and a metal pan over it. 7 or 8 hours works great. (I learned the heating pad trick from the book \"the complete tightwad gazette\") and it ALWAYS works. If you go for a longer time, it gets more tart. I have used it in place of sour cream in recipes, and when I make some, I put some in an ice cube tray and freeze, so I have some to use as the starter for my next batch. YUM!",

I used my slow cooker to maintain the warm water bath and the yogurt was ready in 4 hours. The process is long but very low maintenance so I was able to get school work done - I just had to take a minute periodically to check the water temperature. Thanks for sharing! As an aside: this recipe also makes a great start for something like cream cheese. Just add a few pinches of salt and pour it into a muslin cloth or cloth table napkin. Tie the top with a rubber band and let it drain over a bowl in the fridge for a couple days (use a strainer to keep the cloth out of the drained whey.) I ate my cream cheese on crackers and it tasted so clean and fresh! The drained whey I added in place of water to soup for added protein.",

I used half the liquid (don't need that much yogurt at on time) but used 1 and a half cups of powdered milk (since I was experimenting on getting a thicker consistency). I also did not use my oven to keep it warm but rather put it in a cooler with other bottles of hot water and covered in towels to super insular the lot. It seemed to pretty quickly even out at 104 degrees and let it go from 4pm to 5am (13 hours). Consistency was a lot thicker than last time not runny. now only complaint is it was a wee bit grainy which I have lined up for experiment #3: less powder.",
