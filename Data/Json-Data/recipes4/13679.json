I also added some chopped cherry tomatoes. Next time I will add a lot more veggies! Chard or kale would be great and I would definitely up the carrots to at least 2 c. (maybe even a full pound) to make it a more complete one pot meal. Serves more than just 4. I also suggest cooking everything in a dutch oven on the stove top so you can just slide it into the oven without dirtying another dish.",

I used 2 cups of sliced carrots and chopped up 2 stalks of celery as well. I used pure maple syrup in place of the molasses (because it's what I had on hand) and then used Campbell's beef consomm\u00e9 in place of the water.
