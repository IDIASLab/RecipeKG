It's very tangy, and yes, authentic Filipino adobo doesn't have sugar in it, but Chinese-Filippino versions do - usually rock sugar, 1-2 star anise and coconut milk is sometimes added. These additions definitely soften out the strong vinegar flavor. I always use equal parts vinegar/soy sauce and add about 4-5 tablespoons brown sugar and appx. 1/3 cup coconut unsweetened coconut milk. Or else it's fine without the coconut too. I would definitely use only dark meat for this dish, since chicken breasts dry out too quickly and make even worse left overs.  ",
