We will probably make it again, but possibly using leftover rice to save time so we can heat up when we\u2019re ready to serve, and make a little less of that \u201cpico mixture\u201d (we used the rest for omelets the next day!). What a fun recipe!",

I also couldn\u2019t find the specific pepper in question so I just used other available small red ones (Fresnos?). I followed the previous reviewer\u2019s advice and cooked the onions, peppers, tomatoes, before the beef and eggs and set aside. I had layered everything nicely in the pan and reached to grab the veg. That\u2019s when disaster struck. The grease from my hands and my overly excited movement resulted in my favorite ceramic bowl slipping from my grip and shattering on my hard wood floor. It was not salvageable. I was left with the rice, fried potatoes, beef, and eggs, and I\u2019m not going to lie I ate it with sriracha. Still pretty good. I will definitely attempt this recipe again after I have finished mourning what could have been and my beloved ceramic dish.",
