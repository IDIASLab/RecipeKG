The processed cheese sort of threw me off at first but now I see a little cheddar would only add more flavor to the yummy \"omelet taste\". I like to use chicken most of the time instead of ham but ham is great too! One thing I was surprised about though was that it doesn't call for all the yummy vegetables. I like frying up some chopped onion peppers julienned carrots and chopped tomato before adding the rest of the ingredients. I think that really adds flavor and interest to the dish. My husband prefers an over-easy egg on his and my kids like to eat theirs with toast and a strip of bacon.;) Yum! Overall by it's self this is a great recipe though and can be made for breakfast or dinner!",
