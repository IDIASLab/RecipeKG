I used one huge russet baking potato - grated it into a salad spinner full of cold water - rinsed the potatoes a couple of times to remove the excess starch - grated the apple into the same bowl drained and spun it dry. Then I rinsed the bowl of the salad spinner and used that to mix the eggs potatoes onions etc... in. (one less bowl to wash) I used a heavy non stick skillet with just a bit of oil on the bottom. Once you get the potatoes into the skillet don't move or flip them until the edges are golden brown. Perfect crispy - a delicious Sunday morning treat.",

I also did not peak the apples. Why waste the most nutritious part of the apple. I probably won't peak the potatoes either next time. Oh and while my husband enjoyed it, he suggested saving time by not making the pancake shape and just frying it all up like hash browns. I love that idea and then just use it for a side dish!",

It adds a subtle but pleasant flavor. Because I started out with grated baked potato there was no need to squeeze them dry. I added one cooked & crumbled slice of bacon & fried them in coconut oil with a smidge of the bacon grease for flavor. My boyfriend liked them a lot (he put salsa on top of his) but the kids didn't care for them until I said they could top them with shredded cheese AND pick out the green onion. Next time I might leave out the green onion & use onion powder for that reason.",
