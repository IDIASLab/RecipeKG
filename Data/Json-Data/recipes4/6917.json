It is a very hearty soup, with not a lot of liquid. You can always add more broth if you prefer it that way, but I enjoyed it just as is.",

I also sliced only 1 carrot in thin slivers and made up for it with diced sweet yellow peppers. Delicious and only 39 sodium per cup!!\n\nEdit: in the future instead of Italian seasoning I think I'll just use separate basil and oregano.",
