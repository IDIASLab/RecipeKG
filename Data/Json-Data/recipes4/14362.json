I had last minute surprise guest come who said she would/could not eat okra unless it was fried due to the slime factor. Well on seeing this she said...let me try a \"No thank you portion.\" So I fixed up a tiny serving which (believe me... she would have had no problem consuming only a nibble of) and she ate the whole portion noting that it was not slimy even though it was definitely not fried. So another star added for reducing the slime factor on boiled okra. Thank you for sharing this recipe I think it would be good combined with some shredded chicken for a pita filling.",
