I wish I kept an eye on the temp - I let them get to about 190 degrees and it was drier than I would have liked but the end result was still a hit!  The fresh garlic and onion in the sauce gave it a lot of depth over just plain bbq sauce.  I had to keep myself from eating it up before my guests arrived.  I will definitely make this again!  Thank you!",

Cover with foil and cook for 2.5 hours on 325C. Or, for extra juicy/tender ribs, 250C for 3.5 hours. Once that was completed, I picked back up with the recipe at step 2 and it turned out great.",

I used A1 steak sauce You could taste the steak sauce and the worcestershire even after simmering. So this will turn out differently depending on the steak sauce you use. I used dried minced onion 1T instead of chopping one. I only cooked this 45 min as I was using a convection oven and then on the grill for only 7 because they would have been overcooked and dried out if we had done the whole time as stated. Thanks we really liked this dish!",

I also didn't use celery seed because I didn't have any and it didn't taste like it needed any extra salt or pepper. I put the sauce in the baking dish with the ribs and baked it for 45 minutes at 325 degrees then grilled it on med-low for about 15 minutes. I basted the ribs with some of the sauce from the baking pan and kept the rest warm on the stove for dipping. The ribs turned out very moist and yummy but I think they would have been much too dry without the temperature-time changes.",
