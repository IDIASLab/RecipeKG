I think this is the one I'm gonna use for our Thanksgiving dinner! but it's much easier to cut the pumpkin and squash in half first then bake. not only is it easier to handle after you take it out of the oven but it takes 1/2 the time to cook. pre heat the oven to 400 degrees. cut you squashes in half and scoop out all the seeds then cover them with tin foil and place directly on the middle rack. it will take any where from 30 min to an hour for it to be done. It just depends on the size of your pumpkin. if it's not done after 30 min bake in 15 min increments till it is. Once it's fork tender let cool till you can handle it and just scoop it out of the shell. Happy cooking!",

I didn't have a pumpkin, so I used a can of pumpkin puree, and I didn't have any broth, so I used an extra can of coconut milk plus a can of water.  I didn't want to, but it's all I had.  Still great!  Helpfull hint - cover it while it heats on the stove!  It's kind of like spagheti sauce, in that it will bubble, and spew everywhere! So, just cover it while you warm it.  Thanks for the great recipe!",
