If you find the cheese sauce \"bland\" use fresh grated parmesan (it should be a little stinky) and ground pepper. It should be all you need. My only alteration? I like to put the tomato on TOP of the cheese sauce so it gets a bit broiled too. Then i add the bacon. It's a heart attack on a plate but it sure is good!",

I left out the egg since it was already thickened and then added 3 tablespoons of heavy cream just because if 2 is good 3 is better and I was using 2% milk so compensating. I was heavy handed with the parmesan cheese in the sauce. I'll bet I used almost 1/2 cup worth. I used mesquite smoked turkey shaved (the sandwich meat kind) and it turned out great. My husband loves turkey sandwiches and he really enjoyed this dish too. Great comfort food a keeper for sure! I can't believe I waited so long to try this winner thanks!!!",
