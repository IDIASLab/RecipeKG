This was a nice surprize--great for a special treat when you're having down time on the couch for once. This recipe's a keeper. Just keep in mind you need more candy than the recipe asks for.",

I used 6 1.4 oz patties and when I tasted it there wasn't much flavor luckily I was able to raid the kids Christmas candy and found some of the small patties. I added 5 of the York.6 oz snowflakes to it. Then it tasted pretty good. Not sure I'll make it again but it was worth trying. Just add in a couple extra patties. Thanks!",
