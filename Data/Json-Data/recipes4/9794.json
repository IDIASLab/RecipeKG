Even with extra cooking my beans didn't completely soften which was not a problem after I blended the entire batch. I completely prepared the soup a day early and then set it in a crock pot before we headed out to the pumpkin patch. When we returned a few hours later, the house smelled wonderful and the soup pleased everyone. It is so tasty that we will be having it again soon. Thanks!\n\nUpdate: It is Oct 23, 2008, five years (to the day) after my first review of this soup. We are having it tonight. It is truly a family favorite- a staple of our fall and winter meal plan. It is a great kid-pleaser. BTW, my beans didn't soften up tonight either!",

I did the quick-soak method on my beans...1 pound of beans covered with 2 \" of water, boil 2 minutes, remove from heat, cover and let sit 1 hour.  As others suggested, I left out the 2 c. water when I added the broth and added 1 pound of chopped leftover Thanksgiving ham.  Along with the cayanne and cumin, I added 1/2 tsp curry...the other of my favorite \"c\" spices.  I only pureed about 1/2 as others suggested and the texture was perfect.  On the balsamic vinegar...which seems to be an issue with other reviewers as well...I only had 1T in the pantry for the first batch.  I could barely taste it.  I added the 2T called for in the second batch and I thought it was too strong...but my boyfriend loved it.  Will probably compromise at 1 1/2T next time.  I also added 1T liquid smoke at the end as I LOVE that flavor.  Served it with sour cream and green onions and crusty homemade bread.  Just great!!!  Thanks so much for a WONDERFUL recipe! ",
