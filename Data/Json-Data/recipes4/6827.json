Pasta, beans, and a thick broth, sprinkled with Parm or Romano, and served with fresh crusty Italian bread - what's not to love? I spent a lot of time, back in the day, in the cucina with my friends and their mothers learning the basics of good Italian food!",

After 3 stores, trying to find something called Romano beans, I googled it and found out that a flat Italian green bean could be subbed for the Romano beans.  I could not find them in a can, but I did in the frozen section.  I still would like to find the real thing and make this again.  It was very filling and delicious on a cold, snowy, April day.  It was my first time for using ditalini pasta and I bought my first block of fresh Parmigiano Reggiano cheese to grate on the top before serving.  weeble, this is a delicious recipe, that I will for sure be making again.",
