Don't cook for too long or else the cabbage goes mushy and tasteless, and choose stale bread -soaked in cold water for a day or two- for the best results. A wonderful fall or winter soup that doesn't disappoint. Thanks for sharing Josie!",

I bypassed the sauteing of veggies and just put them directly into the soup. We used Eden's canned cannellini beans instead of cooking from scratch and Muir Glen organic canned tomatoes. My french bread was a few days old. It was difficult to toast in my toaster so I chose to fry it lightly with olive oil and I would do that again as it added lots of flavor! I also used a powdered vegetable broth from Frontier instead of chicken broth and a very small amount of diced jalapeno- not traditional but very tasty!",

I'm only giving it three stars as this was a huge amount of work.  There is no way 30 minutes is the prep time.  I'm an experienced cook and found I was prepping forever.  The instructions should advise the cook to prep everything prior to beginning any cooking.  Good flavor, might make again but would cut the recipe in half.",
