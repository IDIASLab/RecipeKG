It should be made clear that it's *condensed* soup - people also just plain eat cream of chicken soup.  One shouldn't have to discover this from reading a review.  But, I just switched gears & dug up a super easy recipe using the condensed soup, so that wasn't a huge deal.  But then it got worse.   First, I don't see how one can \"whisk\" the flour & milk - it's VERY thick and did nothing but get stuck in my whisk, which was difficult to get out of there.  The \"milk mixture\" (more like \"flour glob mixture\") should NOT be whisked into the hot milk.  You put liquid into globby stuff, not the other way around.  So I put a little of the hot milk into the flour glob, adding more, until it was a consistency that I could put that in the pan.  And no way to avoid lumps.  And that's considering I can make almost anything with ZERO lumps, but this was more like big clumps.  And after this big mess and hassle, it doesn't taste a thing like condensed cream of chicken soup, which has a fairly strong flavor.  It had NO chicken flavor, and tasted like peppered flour, more like something I'd dredge chicken in.  Speaking of flour - WOW!!  Lot of flour!  The recipes I used it for were boring - tried adding some chicken bouillon but didn't help much.  Still tasted like peppered flour.  It would be less hassle and take less time making the trip for the real thing!",

Yes with recipe amount of flour it will be a condensed type of soup. So the 3 stars is due to odd cooking instructions. Now this is just a \"FYI\" - but I decided to create my own version of this soup (which is located in my \"recipe box\"). I thought I'd share and made it public so if anyone cares to they can check it out. I'm not sure if I plan to submit it with Allrecipes just yet so that's the only reason I mention it. The seasonings and most ingredients in this recipe is what inspired me - so thanks for that BabyDollPie!",
