If we are having french fries I top it with ketchup if we are having mashed potatoes I leave it plain and heat up a jar of gravy. Also I shape it into a loaf in a 9x13 pan and add about a cup of water to the pan right before it goes in the oven it helps keep it moist and the meatloaf doesn't stick and the grease is easier to drain out.
