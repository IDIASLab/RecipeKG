I changed the butter to a pat of butter, the rest olive oil, I used nine very large, ripe, meaty red peppers, roasted and peeled the peppers (and added one chipotle pepper). I used 24 oz of chicken and 16 oz. veg broth (Kitchen Basics brand) and added salt. Didn't sieve. Great results but I should have added another onion. Also, next time I think I would try adding a large pureed potato instead of the cream. The cream changed the color of the soup from a gorgeous red to a less-than-gorgeous orange. Tip: cook the vegetables, puree them, them put the puree in a kettle and add the broth--why puree hot broth?",

Also, you can use chopped, frozen onions to save time.  Lastly,  for a nice flavor, roast the peppers ahead of time in a foil pan or foil-lined roasting pan in a 450 degree oven, turning once or twice until brown and puffy on all sides.  Cool, peel, remove stems, and as many seeds as you can.  Add to sauteed onions and garlic and proceed with the recipe.  Cayenne pepper is great in this, as suggested by others.  THANK YOU!",

When it came time to \"puree\" the broth/peppers, I poured it into my handy dandy blender that has never failed me when making my morning smoothies and other tasty treats, and like a smart person should, I put my hand over the lid and turned it on and....WHOOSH!!! Almost half the batch exploded all over the kitchen (Keep in mind...this stuff is hot from the stovetop!)!!  It was on the walls, all over the countertop and I looked like a red pepper threw up on me! You should have seen the eyes on my family! After ensuring noone was hurt, (cuz that stuff was HOT!!) we all had a great laugh. What WAS left (about two bowls worth) was very good. In fact, the soup was VERY good. It has a tomato soup substance but with a refined and elegant taste. However, next time, I'll find my \"safer\" hand mixer...as this soup WILL be repeated and I'll leave my blender in the cupboard! Thank you for the recipe submission Judi...and the laugh! :)",

I also added some seasoning salt and because I live with a vegetarian I used a vegetarian \"chicken stock\". I made it once with a vegetable vegetarian stock but found that the flavor wasn't as rich. For special occasions I usually plate this \"restaurant style\" using a technique that a chef showed me. I add a small dollop of sour cream or creme fraiche to the middle of each soup bowl. Then I add a drop of balsamic vinegar to the middle of the sour cream and put a small peice of micro green (baby salad piece) beside it. It makes it look super fancy and doesn't alter the taste. Thanks Judi for this amazing recipe",

Now I'm a changed woman - red bell peppers are GOOD when they're like this!
