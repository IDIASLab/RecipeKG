Infinite mixtures you can do here; what is important is that the amounts are spot on resulting in a not thick but not too thin drink. I added some ice to one of mine and it was just as good but runny. We tried one with almond milk and buckwheat flakes instead of water and there was really little difference in taste, texture and consistency. Tried one with quinoa flakes and it overpowers the flavour some. All-in-all a great recipe anninlondon, thanks for sharing it with us.",

The texture was good, but I wanted it to be colder, so I blended in some ice cubes.  That did the trick.  I am not a breakfast eater, but I am a breakfast drinker, starting my day with a glass of juice or a smoothie.  This is very good as I got my fruit, my fiber and some dairy.  A great way to start the morning.  Thanks AnnInLondon, for sharing your recipe.",

Instead of regular water I used Coconut water (1/2 C) had to increase the water amount because the smoothie was a bit too thick for me. I also added a tsp of Ceylon Cinnamon (added health benefits). I used 1/2 C of frozen berries (blueberries raspberries strawberries). I don t have steel cut oats so I used quick oats (1/8 C added to 1/8 C ground flax seed) (more fiber). Flavor and consistency were great. I ll make this again for sure. Overall the one I made gave me 36g of Protein 8g fiber and 388 calories.
