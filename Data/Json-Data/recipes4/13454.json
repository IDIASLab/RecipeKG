I was not convinced that this recipe was going to be that great. I was a bit nervous but I at least thought it would be edible. I was blown away! Totally! It is amazing! Simple yet succulent flavors! Amazing! I would give this recipe more stars if I could! My 15 year old God-daughter was here and she was so excited she said that it tasted like a meal you would eat in a really good restaurant! It was truly amazing. I could not find the lamb stew meat so I used lamb chops and it was incredible. I will be making this one again and again and again! Thank you for such a delicious recipe!",

Not the fault of the recipe though I just bought some cheap meat. Very nice flavour we all enjoyed it. Someone brought me saffron from Iran and I think it's a bit stronger than the one that was used in the original recipe. I only used about 3/4 tsp for over 2 lb meat and it was still a bit overpowering. I'll definitely make again but with better quality meat.",
