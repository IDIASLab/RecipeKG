I've never had these cookies stick.  2.  Mix ingredients well but batter should not be smooth!  The nuts and oatmeal are what give them the great texture.  3.  Use a teaspoon to drop onto cookie sheet so that the cookies are very small.  Because they're crumbly and sugared they are easier to eat if they are really small.  Enjoy!",

Used regular oatmeal right from the container (did not process) - these are supposed to have flakes of oatmeal in them. Chopped my pecans up pretty small. Easy to mix up with a wooden spoon and probably don't need parchment. Excellent! Give 'em a try!! OK I wanted to make them smaller so I made 1\" balls. Def the way to go - makes the shape more uniform too. Didn't dust with powdered sugar. Posted pics. Man oh man these are delicious! This is my third update: I chilled the dough and then rolled into balls. They stay a little puffed up that way and I like them better than flat.",

If you want oatmeal flour as suggested just put oatmeal in your food processor or blender to do that. (THAT was a terrific suggestion too) I had good results with oatmeal blended this way. Melt in your mouth goodness! Don't sub margerine for butter unless you want to change the taste and texture of this great cookie. It is perfect as written and was well received by everyone in our house. My oldest called this cookie \"naughty\" because you can't eat just one. Thanks for a keeper recipe!",
