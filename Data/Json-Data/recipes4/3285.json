They turn out the best when following the recipe exactly as written, creamy and just the right amount of heat for the spices, but I have used different cheeses and less spices, just what I had on hand and it turns out great too.  If there is any left over stuffing, it is great served over crackers too.  Great finger food, and good for you.  Thanks for sharing this recipe \"milbax\"!",

I did not have the mushrooms it calls for, so I used regular button mushrooms and it worked out just fine.  Other changes I made, due to materials and taste were: I do not buy bread crumbs, I use croutons crushed.  This time they were a garlic cheese flavor.  I skipped the hot sauce due to taste of guests not being as hot as our family's taste, but have no doubt it would be great with it in as well.  I chopped up the mushroom stems and added them to the filling.  Last, I cooked them for an additional 5 minuets under the broiler.\r\n\r\nFANTASTIC!!!!!!!!  Don't half the recipe because what is left over (and there will be leftover) makes the most awesome dip ever.  I put it out as an appetizer with ritz style crackers and green onions.  It was eaten before, during, and after the meal by people who were already \"stuffed\" but just couldn't help themselves.  This stuff is GREAT!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: For our traditionally non-traditional Thanksgiving meal 2014 I made these again and they were still just awesome!  This time I used PANKO and have fallen in love with the stuff.  Great to use anytime bread crumbs are called for.  baby bella mushrooms were even better than the buttons too! I doubt real crab meat would improve this as it is a stuffing, but I always use imitation for this sort of thing.  I would have given this 5 stars had I not made the small changes I did for personal taste.",

I had difficulty with my cream cheese/shredded cheese mixture being pretty dry, but I went forward anyway, thinking that the cream cheese would get too runny in the oven if I thinned it out up front.  Must be the cheap cream cheese I bought -- it stayed pretty thick.  I never could mix the bread crumbs in, but we didn't miss them. Because I was using this as a main dish, I used an entire 14-oz pkg of imitation crab.  It took a bit of doing, but I was finally able to mix it into the cream cheese mixture.  Because we left out the bread crumbs, I sprinkled a little more shredded cheese on top at the broiling stage.  The flavor was good, though I think we'd prefer to use the topping on a loaf of French bread.  The mushroom flavor overpowered the topping.  I guess that's what I get for changing the recipe!  We will definitely use the topping again, though not for mushrooms.",
