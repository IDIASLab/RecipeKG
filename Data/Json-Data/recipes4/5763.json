I was highly surprised that the peas held their texture after being heated that long. Although, I only gently stirred once at the 2 hour mark. I also substituted 1 lb of pre cooked bulk pork sausage Instead of the ham. I must say that these peas came out fabulous and this recipe is my go to for black eyed peas.",

I would have not thought to add butter to black eyed peas but it really made a difference in the overall flavor. I recommend refraining from stirring too often or you will end up with mushy peas. Great flavor and super simple to make!",
