I found it very flavorful but I made a few changes: I used a 2-to-1 ratio of liquid to quinoa using mostly coconut milk; subbed raw almond butter for peanut butter; subbed currants for raisins; and added fresh cilantro at the end. I think the cilantro was key. Don't expect this to taste like coconut though; the sauce is the dominant flavor.",
