Add extra carrots lentils and potatoes reduce flour to 1/2 c. and liquid to 3 Qts. and omit the olive oil and bouillion and you'll end up with a much heartier and healthier soup! Be sure to cook on low low heat and stir often. I also used chicken broth for 2 qts. of the liquid and salted to taste after cooking because I wasn't sure how salty my bacon was. I'm not a big fan of thyme and 1/2 tsp was enough for me. I also used a teaspoon each of powdered onion and garlic no fresh. Guess that was alot of tweaking....",

This soup is very tasty but at almost 13grams of fat per serving (that is 50% fat!) I would hardly call it \"healthy\" despite the healthy lentil and vegetable ingredients. For this reason I decreased the bacon to 4 slices and added only 1 teaspoon of olive oil instead of the 4 tablespoons called for. I still found the soup to be rich and tasty.",
