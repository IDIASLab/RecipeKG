I followed the directions with the exception I have no idea what the fish weighed and I had no tomatoes. I wish I had stopped cooking it at 4 minutes ( I should have considered microwave wattage) next time I will. My salmon overcooked just a little but it was very tasty and I served my 3 preschoolers leftover rice with the salmon and the drippings with microwave steamed broccoli. Not having to cook the rice this lunch was remarkably health conscious cost efficient and most of all time efficient. It took less than 15 minutes from start of prep to serve time. (I heated the rice and steamed the broccoli at the same time I was prepping the fish) But the absolute best part? Not one drop remained and three kids ready for a nap! The only drawback was that it was not visually appealing...which might have been my lack of tomatoes! Overall a great hit with the under 5 crowd...I can't wait to try it on the older guys. Thanks so much for posting.",

My salmon was already partially cedar-plank cooked (although the middle was too red for me) so I did the onion/tomato mixture for 3 minutes by themselves. I felt that really cooked them too much the tomatoes were total mush. I threw the salmon on top for about 2 minutes at 50% power. It finished cooking the salmon and gave me a nice fresh tasting sauce to eat with it. Next time the tomatoes will go in at a later time. But overall it was a great easy healthy tasting dish.
