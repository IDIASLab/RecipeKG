It's easy to assemble and can be prepared ahead of time. It pairs well with beef, ham, or chicken. Leftovers, if there are any, reheat well. Everyone always loves 'The Irish Potatoes.' Yes, I know 'The Irish Potatoes' are fattening, but without the butter, whipping cream, and half and half it is just not as good. Substituting margarine or frozen hash browns would be a travesty.",

I have made them with canned evaporated milk and shredded frozen hash brown potatoes and we thought they were just as good. If you use canned milk just keep in mind that it gives it a slighty different taste. My hubby actually likes them better with canned milk. These are a good side dish with just about anything but I always make these with meatloaf.",
