I marinated the roast for several hours (used white wine and dijon because that is what I had) then browned it in a skillet and transferred to my crockpot along with a sliced onion. I took the leftover marinade and heated it to a boil on the stovetop and added just the apricot jam. I poured this over the roast and cooked on low. The meat was very flavorful and the sauce was great over rice as well.",
