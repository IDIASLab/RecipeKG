I just returned from the supermarket with 4 more packs of mushrooms just so I can make this again.  If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I certainly would.  No need to change a thing, PERFECT AS IS!!!!  Thank you soooooooooo much for an easy, quick, healthy and delicious recipe.  This has officially become a staple in my recipe box!",
