My family likes it spicy, so we even have a bottle of hot sauce on the side for an additional kick! We serve this with a fancy fruit salad and all the Easter fixings for a delicious brunch buffet! Serve with additional sour cream, if desired",

It was a little too watery and not as attractive as it could be.  I think serving the remaining salsa on the side would be good.  (Salsa Verde would be great too!)  If you don't have avocado, no worries - make this anyway.  Leftovers are going to be re-warmed and wrapped in a flour tortilla for an easy breakfast burrito.  Thanks!",

I had already made up a delicious Indian dinner but got bored & did this in addition. It was a bigger hit than the Indian food. Today I made this again and doubled the recipe because the 11x13 pan for 4 people disappeared to fast. I did the sour cream and eggs in the blender to aerate which my eater loved how fluffy they were. I added mushrooms jalepenos and at the very end did sprouts on top after it was out of the oven. I learned doubling the recipe wasn't enough for 6 people. I'll have two make two doubled recipes next time. What a hit!!!",
