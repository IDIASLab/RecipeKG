This was the dish that filled that bill. \nI did dust the chops with flour, I had a couple more chops, so I added some drIed onion and swapped out the sherry for a little bit of chicken broth. Added some extra milk and thinned it out with a little water. I served it with some mashed potatoes that had some kale thrown in for color. Quick n delicious!  Thanks Mizzlex. Keeper:):)",
