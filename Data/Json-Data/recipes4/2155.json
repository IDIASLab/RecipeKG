                "reviewBody": "I used a 2 lb. boneless pork roast and cut huge slits in it about 1 inch apart. I didn't have dried pineapple on hand so I used raisins which worked out well. I had a huge container of fresh spinach from Sam's Club so I stuffed as much spinach as possible in each of the slits along with the raisins from a snack size raisin box. Take note that the recipe contains no liquid. I added about 1/4 C of water to the roaster but that wasn't enough. Two hours later I returned from running errands to find the smell of something burning. The vegetables were burned black and had to be discarded. However the roast survived and tasted great. Be sure to add some sort of liquid probably 1 cup would have done it to the roaster of pork and vegetables in the oven- water/wine/broth/juice etc. Perhaps sliced apples roasting with the pork roast would also be good. Great recipe just needs some tweaking.",

I only used 1 teaspoon of the garlic powder and onion powder because I thought a tablespoon of each would be too much. I covered it with loose tin foil and put a little pineapple juice in the bottom of the pan. I used dried parsley instead of fresh. No need to baste. Be sure to use the drippings in the pan as a sauce. The best part was the smell as it was roasting. I imagine that smell coming from Gordon Ramsey's kitchen not mine. If there was a candle that smelled like that I'd buy it. My family was very impressed. Enjoy!",
