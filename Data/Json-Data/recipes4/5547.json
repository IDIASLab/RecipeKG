This (loosely inspired by German potato salad) recipe is tasty hot or cold and great for outdoor dining - no mayo to worry about keeping cold. Also, you can switch it up and play with different flavor combinations by swapping the vinegar, herbs, and spices. Enjoy!",

The potatoes just didn't have enough flavor so I had to add a lot of salt. Otherwise it just tasted like bland potatoes. Maybe a balsamic vinegar reduction would be better? Regardless this recipe needs a little \"jazz-ing\" up to make it work. UPDATE 06/18/12 After the potatoes cooled down about a day they did seem to have pretty good flavor though the balsamic is still not very prominent. I still suggest using a balsamic reduction to really glaze the potatoes.",
