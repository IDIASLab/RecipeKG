I had the same problem that everyone else did with a dense pancake that rose beautifully but struggled to cook and were a little rubbery. I think part of that is that it might have needed even more milk than I added and I had to mix it more than I would have liked to incorporate the extra milk. I'd like to try this again with a few changes. I think it could be as good as the title states with the right amount of milk. Kind of a sad day in this house as we're serious pancake worshipers.",

I halved the recipe and I had to add a lot more soy milk than called for to get to a consistency that was workable. Without this modification my batter was like cookie dough. I didn't have the vanilla powdered creamer but suppose it was accomodated for in the soy milk which was vanilla flavored. Thank you Jeff I will definately make these again perhaps trying a little cardamom",

Had run out of eggs for our usual weekend brunch and had a random box of buttermilk pancake mix and a boyfriend who doesn't like pancakes so I wanted to jazz them up. I halved the recipe but more than doubled the milk. Used about triple actually (closer to package direction quantity.) And I used skim milk cause that's what I had. I used straight cinnamon instead of cinnamon sugar and replaced most of the powdered creamer with granulated \"vanilla sugar\" which I use to top specialty coffees usually. I used the good stuff for the vanilla extract but doubled it to make up for the creamer. I used creamed honey... don't know if that's any different but again it's what I had. I figured more or less the recipe came out the same as if I'd followed exactly (except maybe the milk). The pancakes were thick but fluffy in texture and absorbed the syrup well. They didn't bubble but were easy to time on medium heat. The mixture was thicker than I was used to even after doubling the milk but it turned out very well. Boyfriend who hates pancakes asked me to make them again! This will definitely stay in my cookbook. Thanks Jeff.",

I found myself reaching for more than a couple and I am not a pancake fan. I used about 1/4 c. liquid hazelnut creamer since that's what I had and added it to the milk in measuring. I did use significantly more milk than the recipe called for. For the cinnamon and sugar I used them separately and estimated. I was heavy handed on the sugar. We will definitely make it again.
