Changes I make are as follows: I don't prepare the dressing as directed on the package, I just mix everything into the dry mix then add an entire 15 oz. can of beef or chicken broth, no water. It turns out perfect every time. I also add chopped water chestnuts and a can of sliced mushrooms. I cook the onions and celery with the sausage so they are soft. I use 2 packages of Stove Top cornbread stuffing mix. We love this!",
