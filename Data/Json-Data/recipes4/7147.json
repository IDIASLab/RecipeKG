This sure makes alot!\" So the submitter of the recipe is right; even in half, this makes a ton! As it resembled a cabbage roll's guts, I made rice alongside it for serving, but found that the leftovers the next day that had been mixed up w/ the rice, were far superior. Wasn't too thrilled w/ the heavy vinegar taste, and felt that it could've benefited from the addition of minced garlic, so when I make this again (which I will as we really did like it alot), I would serve it mixed w/, instead of on top of, rice, reduce the vinegar, and add garlic, and probably make a full batch, as I imagine extras would freeze nicely for a reheated casserole later on.",

I did not have diced tomatoes or distilled vinegar, so I substituted with tomato sauce and apple cider vinegar. I also added 1 red pepper and did not use ground beef because I didn't think the recipe needed that much meat. The edit by the author to cook the dish in a dutch oven or in a pot on the stove is very important. \n\nMy grocery store did not have a great variety of pork, but in retrospect if you have access to chorizo it might add to the flavor. I also supplemented the flavor by adding two bay leaves, about 3 teaspoons of ground sweet basil, and a small handful of cheddar cheese before serving. It does make a lot, but I am anticipating the left overs.",

I made quite a few changes because of the ingredients I had on hand and to increase the variety of veggies which included the addition of 1 small leek a large stalk of celery about 1.5 cups sliced carrots and about 1 cup diced apple added in the last 2.minutes of cooking. Also to aide digestion I added a couple tablespoons of fresh. finely minced ginger root. I sauted the mirepoix with the leek and ginger root about 10 minutes over med-low flame with a tablespoon of olive oil and a few spoonfuls of water in the last few minutes as needed. I only had a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes so I added a 1/2 cup of water. Also had to substitute white wine vinegar for plain. To make it a bit lighter I only used 1/2 pound cooked sausage and about 4 oz. cooked ground beef. This was more than satisfying and reduced cost and calories. To beef up the protein and fiber I served it with steamed quinoa and the flavor of the grain was the perfect compliment to the smoky chili spices. Finally I forgot about the tomato paste until after the dish was done and so I added that at the end and only heated it through; this worked really well because it kept the bright high notes of the tomato from mellowing through cooking which was surprisingly perfect. Shared some with friends who aren't big vegetable lovers and they asked for seconds and skipped",
