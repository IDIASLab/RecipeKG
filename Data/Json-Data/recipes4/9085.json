Way too many \"random\" ingredients. We ate it as a pasta dish and not as a casserole (no crushed Ritz crust). Next time we'd omit the ranch-Hubby felt too creamy and I felt it an unnecessary ingredient. We prinkled shredded cheddar on top. Both of us had 2 helpings. This was pretty much chicken Alfredo with bacon and broccoli. Would give 3 1/2 stars if possible.",
