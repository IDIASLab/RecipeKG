Talked with the butcher and he convinced me to buy an untrimmed brisket.  He said cooking it with the fat added a great deal of flavor. So for 20 guests I bought a 13 pound untrimmed brisket.  Based on this recipe and recommendations. we cooked ours in the oven 7 hours at 275 degrees.  This was the perfect amount of time. Took it out and trimmed all the fat off, and then sliced as thin as we could.  While cooking, used some rub on the meat as suggested and nearly a can of beer.  We cooked it the day before.  Also made Big Al's BBQ Sauce on this site.  After cooking and slicing, soaked it all night long in the sauce and then warmed slowly on 275 degrees before the party.  It was fabulous!  Everyone raved.  Served on nice rolls with some good deli cheddar cheese.  Yummy.",
