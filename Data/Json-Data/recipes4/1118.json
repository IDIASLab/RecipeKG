Fill the jalapeno with the cream cheese (you can almost cut it with a knife off the block) put the smaller chicken strip on top of the cream cheese and wrap a slice of bacon around your jalapeno cream cheese and chicken. Then cook on the grill for a great appetizer...Yummy",

Add some bagels to your shopping list and you can use the leftover bacon and cream cheese for well cream cheese and bacon bagels...mmmmmmmm.",

First I did grill the peppers before I put them in the chicken and I stuffed them with chedder cheese I despise cream cheese. Also I made homeade italian dressing (the kind that comes in the seasoning packet that you mix with oil and vinegar) that gave it a very robust flavor. Then when I marinated it I threw in some fresh diced garlic basil and parsly. It gave it A LOT of flavor. The bacon is a must it adds a nice flavor and really holds it together during cooking (the secret to keeping the chicken in one piece is to put the bundles of chicken packed TIGHT on a HOT grill and leave for 5 mins before turning then lower the heat)I liked this a lot I served it with corn and herb potatoes definately a keeper!",
