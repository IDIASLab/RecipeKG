I don't normally use the microwave to cook my veggies or any food for that matter but I wanted to follow the recipe exactly. Keep in mind microwaves will vary so I think 4 minutes would be perfect next time in my 1000W microwave. The servings size is a little on the small size so I made 3/4 lb instead of 1/2. I kept the chicken granules the same though and it turned out much too salty for my tastes. This could just be the brand I used (Knorr) but next time I will use about half the stated amount and also use unsalted butter. I also used less garlic than called for since the garlic is raw and therefore quite potent. I will definitely make these again with the minor tweaks. Even though they were too salty I ended up eating 4 servings (SHHHH they were SMALL servings!) Thank you Chelsey for the quick and tasty recipe!",
