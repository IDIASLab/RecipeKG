It's super quick and easy and yet it still tastes great. I don't often try recipes that haven't gone through the allrecipes gauntlet and gotten reviews with things that need to be altered but I wanted something different for my ham. I was tired of the same old same old pineapple or maple recipes. So I gave this one a try and was glad I did. This one will be a keeper for me and I'll be passng it along to my daughters who need uncomplicated and quick recipes.",
