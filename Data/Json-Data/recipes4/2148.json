I also use two eggs and one grated carrot in the meat to keep it from getting too dry. The kicker is that I don't fry them in oil I just put them in the oven on 380 for about 35 min. This is a much healthier version. Served with ketchup or gravy, either is good.",

Like others I had to keep cleaning out the skillet to get rid of burnt breading. Kept done ones on a rack on a cookie sheet in the oven at 300F while cooking the rest to keep warm. I used two eggs in the meat mixture. Did not need to be cooked 7 minutes... only until nicely browned. I made up a packet of Country Gravy and had mashed potatoes and corn. True comfort food!

I get a package of hamburger patties already made up, which are pretty thick, season them them garlic powder, onion powder, steak seasoning, and pepper.   Cover them with flour, dip in mixture of egg and buttermilk, put them back in the flour and cook covered on medium heat till done.  About 4-5 min on each side.  Then I scrape the bottom of the iron skillet to get all the goodies off, drain all but about 2-3 tablespoons of oil, then add about 3-4 tablespoons of flour, cooking till brown, then I mix up a cup of milk and half a cup of water together and add it a little at a time till I get a thick gravy.  Pour over the steaks and serve with garlic mashed potatoes and veggie.  One delish meal.",

I used ground turkey instead of beef, but in every other way I followed the recipe to the letter.  The chili powder is definitely noticeable, but since we like chili powder that was no problem.  And I actually think it's the combination of the chili powder and the saltines that makes this so steak-like.  I used a nonstick pan with a light coat of olive oil, and fried them on 7 minutes for the first side and 5 for the second (covered so that the meat would \"bake\" while it fried).  I served it with brown rice and a mushroom cream gravy - very tasty!  Thanks!",

The ingredients are simple the preparation is simple and the cooking part is simple... no complaints from me at all. This recipe definitely gets 5 stars from me! Thanks. =)",

As written the chili powder is overwhelming and the crumbs don't stick to the patties. I would half the amount of chili powder and dip the patties as regular chicken fried steak--flour egg flour or cracker crumb. I lined and sprayed a baking sheet and cooked at 375 for 30 minutes like another reviewer suggested. They cooked up great but forgot to make the patties thin as they shrink and plump when cooked. I loved that these can be baked so much healthier for you. Next time I will try these changes and it could be a keeper.",
