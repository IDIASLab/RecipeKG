In addition to the substitutions when adding the fresh pumpkin and chesses at the end I let the risotto remain on the heat to absorb the flavors and set up a bit firmer then the photograph shown. I also doubled the recipe as I was taking it to Thanksgiving dinner for 10 people. It was a Big favorite among all the friends! I will make this again and as a lover of spicy food I will double the serrano peppers",
