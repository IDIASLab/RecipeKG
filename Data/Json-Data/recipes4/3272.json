Then I simmered the meat mixture on the stove for about 30 minutes to let the flavors really infuse. Instead of biscuits I used two boxes of good old Jiffy Cornbread batter (prepared according to directions) and spread it on the bottom of the pan. Then I spooned the meat mixture on top and added the cheese. Cooked for 40 minutes. This is wonderful! So easy to prepare and good comfort food. Thanks!",

I did not add the biscuits as bottom crust I added corn bread as a Top crust ( cause honestly I did not read it correctly and was cooking in a hurry) But it was pretty close to one of the best casserole dishes I have made!! maybe next time I'll make it as it says to Chili beans sound yummy too!
