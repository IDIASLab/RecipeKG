The basis for this particular recipe is rather sound, but I, too, found them very bland. I reduced the amount of liquid for the mixture ever so slightly and roll the dumplings in my hand (approx. 1.5\" - 2\" round each). I've found that adding approximately a tbs. (or so; I do it by sight) each of finely-diced fresh parsley, dill and scallions, as well as adding onion or chicken bullion cubes and another tbs. or so of finely-diced scallions to the water (1 cube per cup of water) does wonders! Tried it for the potato dumplings I'd made this past St. Nicholas Day (with a Sauerbraten recipe I'd found on allrecipes.com, which always comes out great), and the dumplings came out perfect!  You can also keep the dumplings in the broth and serve as a soup.",

I actually made them with only 1 egg (didn't read the recipe well) and they turned out just fine. Like other reviewers I had a problem kneading them. I used my dough hook and just kept adding flour but they were still sticky even after adding almost 3/4 C more flour. I pretty much took a spoon and dumped 6 blobs into chicken broth to cook. They weren't pretty but they taste great. Next time I will make them smaller since I thought they were too big. I agree that on their own they are bland but I've never eaten dumplings without buttter and salt or gravy of some sort. We will definately have these again. Thank you for sharing.",
