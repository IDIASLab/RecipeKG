I also used ground turkey instead of pork a mix of chopped turnip carrot and garlic instead of celery. I subbed a small amount of almonds for the pecans but the recipe would be fine without any nuts at all. I thought the raisins were important. I did not need to mash the squash - after I scooped it it blended in perfectly. I did add a dash of salt and pepper and used store-bought Italian breadcrumbs. I topped with cheese for the final bake. This recipe is very forgiving and you could really make lots of substitutions or additions depending on your tastes. My husband and I enjoyed it very much.",

I also left out the thyme and instead used italian style bread crumbs and added some italian seasoning along with salt and pepper. I left out the raisins but felt the pecans really added some good flavor and crunch. I also increased the celery to 3 stalks to add some more veggies and crunch. Lastly I topped it with mozzarella cheese for the last 10 minutes of baking which was good but next time I'm going to try some shredded parmesan cheese. I also think adding a cup or two of cooked rice would taste good and will probably try that at some point as well.",
