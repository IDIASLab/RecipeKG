Instead of beef bones I used 8 c boiling water and to it added 8 beef bouillon cubes, I also used 2 c homemade re-heated Chicken Stock.  I used 2 cans Red Kidney beans, my preference, u can use one red and one can of Chick peas.  I also added 1 can Diced tomatoes.  First I sauted 2 onions & 5 cloves garlic in 2T Olive Oil for 7 min.   Then I added chopped in quarters the whole package Gaspars linguica, chopped and quartered, sauted that for 10 min. covered, stirring occasionally. Then added canned beans & tomatoes, and 2 bay leaves. Let that simmer, 20 min. then added the beef bouillon and chicken stock, and 1/2c Portuguese White Wine,  let that simmer ag. ab. 15 min.  Lastly, I added 5 chopped peeled potatoes, 3 bunches chopped Kale, 1/2 head of chopped cabbage, 4 oz tiny pasta and some sea salt & black pepper to taste.  Done in 15 minutes.  Yummy!",

I'll give you a couple of twists on the recipe provided that will make it a little easier and taste great. For the broth use 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 chicken broth. No need to make your own unless you really want to. Around here we don't use the cabbage and we use either red kidney beans or pinto beans. In other parts of the country it is hard to find Chourico....(not to be confused with Chourizo which is Mexican and is very different), but the Chourico is essential! Linguica comes in a close second and is easier to find. If you really want to taste authentic Portugese soup then you really should make the effort to find the Chourico. But beware!! it is spicy! This is great soup that tastes very unique but try it without the kids first..it may be a little much for them. Give it a try!",

                "reviewBody": "John, your mom certainly knew what she was doing because my family and I agreed that this was one of the best soups we've ever eaten! I didn't add the bones to the soup, however, slowly roasted beef bones the day before and then made my stock.(better flavor) The following day I was then able to get rid of the fat that had surfaced and hardened. If I hadn't already had the bones in the house, I would have just used canned low salt beef broth and consomme. I did add more seasonings to the soup (garlic and onion powders) along with a can of beef consomme for some added flavor. Hubby did the grocery shopping and couldn't find pea beans, so we used canned pinto beans instead. Our grocery store didn't carry chorizo, so he decided to go to a specialty market to get it and paid $11.00 a pound for the sausage. Yikes! The kale held up beautifully in the soup (thanks Mic for the 411 on kale), the chorizo added a hint of heat and the cabbage mellowed out the whole soup with a touch of sweetness. Thanks for an amazing and delicious soup recipe that's even more appreciated on a sub-zero winter evening!",
