Mine were extra Creamy) I ended up having to add the majority of the bread crumb mix into my patties so they could form. I baked mine for 30 minutes and they were nice and crisp but still soft on the inside. Garnished with additional cheese jalepenos banana peppers and some cilantro. This is an excellent way to use up mashed potatoes and me them 100% different. Will make again and will add some cilantro into the mix as well!",
