Maybe next time I'll try to cook the bacon a bit first OR maybe not even roll up the chicken and just put everything on top of the chicken then broil...the bacon will be more evenly cooked. The combination of all the flavors was great. I definitely recommend it...don't be afraid of the jalapenos if you don't like it spicy...just take out most seeds.",

After having a difficult time rolling up the first one without all the stuff inside falling out I flattened the other two with a meat mallett and that made it a little easier. I had a couple of holes from butterflieng and pounding the chicken but nothing fell out!! I rubbed the ranch dressing into the chicken then topped with cheese pickled jalapeno slices and the roma tomato slices. I then placed the flattened chicken ontop of the two pieces of bacon at one end of the bacon and kinda rolled it up and wrapped it at the same time!! It worked out quite well only a little but of the \"stuffing\" fell out. After placing the stuffed & wrapped chicken in a baking dish I sprinkled the rest of the ranch seasoning packet on top. I did remove the foil and placed the chicken on a broiler rack and upped the temp to 400 to crisp the bacon up. It turned out sooooo good. I wish I had made more than just 3. Thanks for the unique recipe.",
