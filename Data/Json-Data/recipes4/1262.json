I was going to use tin foil instead of the banana leaf but I realized that we had one of those trees in our back yard! The next time I make this I will watch carefully the cooking time and NOT cover the grill (I overcooked this batch cooking 15 mins with lid on). I will also use 1/2 the cumin. But otherwise this is a very good recipe and I can't wait to try it again!",

                "reviewBody": "I really really enjoyed this however as written I felt the squid got overcooked and here is my opinion as to why. The acid in fresh lime juice \"cooks\" seafood. After 2 hours in the lime juice my squid were near done and so the 15 minutes on the grill was just too much. However you really need the 15 minutes on the grill to get that nice banana leaf flavor to come out and that flavor really does play a big part in the overall dish. I recommend leaving the lime juice out of the marinade altogether and then fresh squeeze it over the finished dish. There are a lot of different flavors going on in this but they work together nicely and the outcome is amazing. I already cannot wait to try this again using shrimp and other various seafood but I will be sure to save the lime juice for the end. This is a great recipe and I highly recommend it!",
