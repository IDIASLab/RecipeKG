Maybe some of it should have been strained off before adding to the pie dish. Also we could hardly taste the swiss cheese. I was expecting something much more savory but it's a good way to use up summer veggies. I'll need to tweak the recipe more to find a more satisfying flavor.",

Not everyone tried it but my coworkers who did loved it. One kept telling me it tasted like pizza! I'm not sure about it but the tomatoes did give it a saucy flavor to some extent. I didn't have zucchini but I did have some shredded carrots and red peppers so I put those in instead. I chopped the red peppers pretty finely and I drained the tomatoes as much as I could. I thought I had a lid for the skillet I was using but I couldn't find it so I ended up cooking it without a lid on. It cooked faster and carmelized the veggies a bit--a happy accident! I forgot to put the cheese in the crust and so just put it on top of the tarte about 10 min before taking it out of the oven. My eggs had not set in the designated cooking time and I ended up baking the tarte for 40 min. All tweaking aside baked up lovely. I used the Miracle Baking Powder Crust on AR and prebaked it for 10 min. Thanks for the recipe!",
