We do however add a few eggs to the ricotta cheese (to help hold the lasagna together) as well as some seasoning which is why one of the reviewers probably said the recipe was a little bland. Add black pepper some nutmeg (a pinch) some parmesan cheese and some fresh or dried parsley. In addition his sauce is a great starter. Cooking some meat in the sauce will yield a richer taste (if you eat meat). I bake some sausages in the oven to get rid of the excess oil then drop in the sauce to cook. These can be served on the side or cut up and added to the lasagna in slices. Same goes for meatballs.",

My entire family (even the picky ones) raved over this. The only thing she changed was making one large casserole instead of two. We used some of the extra marinara sauce to dip the garlic bread in (I made Great Garlic Bread from this site). SO GOOD!! She let the sauce stand in the fridge for 2 nights so the flavors would really meld! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe. It is now a family favorite.:)",
