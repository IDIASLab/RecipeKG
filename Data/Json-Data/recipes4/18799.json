I also found that it needed LOTS more salt so I added a few pinches of salt and about triple the fish sauce. Also my rice burned on me so next time I will reduce to a very low heat after it boils. Lastly this recipe needs WAY more than 5 cups of water... I must have used 15 and next time will probably use about 20-23 - it boils down quickly so it requires a lot of water. Overall the taste was fine and it's a nice recipe for a different type of cuisine.",
