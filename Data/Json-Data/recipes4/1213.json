Since then we've used this recipe and THIS IS THE WAY TO GO!!!! The marinade has the consistency of wet sand. I rub it on the skin under the skin and in the cavity. Once fried all the spices become milder and form a sort of crust that you just slice right through. The meat is tender moist and incredibly flavorful. Awesome awesome awesome recipe!",

I kept debating whether to add as much pepper as it called for. And people thought I was nuts when I told them about the recipe. But.. the night before Turkey Day.. My husband and I mixed it all up.. and smeared it on. So it sat overnight. I didn't get much sleep and there were a few times where I just thought about washing the rub off. But.. I didn't. THANK GOD! because it turned out WONDERFUL. The crust was out of this world. I didn't like ANY of the ingredients we mixed together.. but.. added together and cooked like that. Oh my gosh.. just AWESOME. Although, next time.. I think I'd like to inject some italian dressing INTO the turkey. I highly recommend this marinade/rub. And it will be what I use for now on. Oh yeah, and my first Thanksgiving dinner turned out GREAT! and the turkey was a BIG HIT!",

The marinade was the consistency and look of very wet coffee grounds,but I forged ahead. I fried the turkey 3mins/lb plus 5 mins and when I took the turkey out it was almost completely black! I was sure it was burned beyond use. I was serving 27 guests for Thanksgiving and this was to be one of two turkeys served. I sliced a piece and tried it - it was one of the best turkeys I have ever had. Give this a try, we will be making it again. P.S. I injected my turkey with a 1/2 bottle of italian dressing strained to remove the big bits of seasoning and 1/2 cup of Reisling wine. Wonderful compliment to the delicious skin.",

The leftovers made a good spicy meat for sandwiches but the overpowering flavor made the meat less than ideal for turkey soup or pot pie. The mariande just permeated everything and I LOVE spicy foods--I order the hottest wing possible and then add more hot sauce from the bottle. Perhaps it was the black pepper that overrode all other flavors. I also think this marinade adds spice to the white meat but doesn't do much for the dark meat but I also think that's true of deep-frying turkey in general. As a stand alone turkey recipe it was tasty but it doesn't complement any holiday side dishes (stuffing sweet potatoes etc.) I will not use this marinade for holiday turkey again; I will stick with brining and roasting my bird.",
