I added some parmesan, basil and no-salt seasoning to the mix and ommitted the salt, but next time I WILL add a little salt b/c I feel it was needed...  Also, make sure you use the full amount of butter or coat the slices with it before baking, b/c I cut the amount and some of my slices would not brown on both sides after I flipped them.  You could also spray these with nonfat Pam or an olive oil spray for a healthier version...  In any case, these are delicious and I will use potato flake breading for EVERYTHING!  Can't wait to try it on fish!!!",

I didn't flip'em they really didn't need it but next time I may do that because they were a 'little' crunchier on the bottom. This was my sons (12 yo) first go at eggplant needless to say he intitially said \"ain't gonna do it\" but he tried a bite and then ate 3 slices! Imagine that...;-)",
