Put Slap Ya Mama seasoning and Sriracha chili sauce on the table. It received RAVE reviews!",

Because I was wanting a Cajun kick, I bought a 4 pack of Louisiana  style Cajun sausages.  Several reviewers suggested that it didn't have nearly enough sausage in it, so I just chopped up all 4 sausages and I thought it was the perfect amount.  I also really liked the subtle wine flavor, which is unique for a breakfast casserole (I just used the cheapest Chardonnay I could find).  My only suggestion is that I think the Monterey cheese could be cut down from 4 cups to 3 cups.  Overall, I thought it was a unique, great idea, and I will definitely make it again.",

I doubled it and it was just enough where you could at least taste it. Second it calls for a lb. of cheese. For me that is way too much. I cut that in half and used one package (8 oz) of cheese which worked fine. That way you can taste the rest of this instead of just the cheese. Third i didn't have green onions so I chopped up one onion and sauteed it in a pan THEN added it. It was delicious and you could taste that buttery soft onion in there... I would make this again but not as the original recipe states. The bread soaking in the egg overnight made it delicious though and it is worth a pop in the oven!",
