My husband had bought two 11-pound pieces of brisket on sale (you know buy one get one free) not realizing that the bigger pieces of brisket are much more tough than say an 8-pound brisket. After smoking one brisket and finding it excessively chewy and unappetizing I decided to corn the remaining monster. I used pickling salt (this doesn't have iodine in it and so you wont get a funky bitter after taste) as well as some Penzey's corning spices in the salt brine. Target has some wonderful glass pickle jars that come with lids - and the large one (it's around 12.99) held this 11-pound brisket cut into 2 pieces with no problem. In fact I had to make more salt brine to cover it all and the pickle jar held the huge hunk of meat along with 1 1/2 gallons of brine easily. We have eaten the corned beef with the caggage potatoes etc as well as made some killer Reuben sandwhiches! Even though we just ate all this corned beef in February my family is already clamoring for it to be made and served again for St. Patrick's Day! PS If the beef is too tender and falls apart when you slice it for sandwhiches just chill the meat really well and it then holds together nicely.",

You must remember to check that temp stays in mid 30's to low 40's or things won't cure. Also remember that cured meat does not hold in freezer very long because of salt content.

We went to a parade in town so to avoid having to \"watch the pot\" I used a crock pot -- 4.5 hrs. on \"high\" which was probably too long but that's not the recipe's fault (it started as a 4 lb. brisket that I trimmed probably a pound of fat off of and then \"corned\" myself using these instructions and also cut it in two so that it would fit in the crock pot; it probably should have cooked for 3.5 - 4 hrs. on high). I put in the bay leaves peppercorns etc. in the morning (I used the amount specified even though I was using a smaller piece of meat) and then put in the potatoes and onions right before we left for the parade - I think a little over an hour before it's finished would be perfect. I cooked the cabbage separately but next time I think I'll add it at the same time as the potatoes and onions. I also forgot to pick up a turnip and the cilantro but it really turned out great anyway! I'm really looking forward to trying this again next year (and might not wait)!",
