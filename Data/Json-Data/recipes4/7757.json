This will make the cauliflower crispy and slightly sweet.  Steaming and boiling only adds water to the cauliflower, making it mushy and watery. I made this following the recipe and then again trying to remove as much excess water as possible....and then finally realizing in need to roast them first.  After roasting it, it has been the best side dish, hands down. I will make it for dinner, parities, and potluck and the kids and adults will always gobble it up.  Follow the rest of the recipe, but please make sure you roast them first (LIGHTLY coated with olive oil.  Salt is optional).",

Once heated through,  removed from the heat, added the sour cream and mayo and cheese, then cauliflower, and etc per the recipe. I didn't use mushrooms either. \n\nTwo finicky teenagers and myself gobbled over half of it in about 20 minutes. Delicious! !",
