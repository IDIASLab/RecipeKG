I followed the directions with the foil pouch, but just slipped it in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.  Hubs always turns his nose up when I make zucchini, but not this time. It came out flavorful and crisp/tender, which he appreciated.  (I tend to like mine on the soft, well-cooked side).  I didn't use the cayenne pepper, preferring to substitute my seasoning of choice which in this case was just some sort of seasoning blend in the cupboard. This will be a repeat. It's nice to keep Hubs happy.",

I did doubled the squash and zucchini and left everything else the same because I saw the amount of cayenne. While the older 2 girls said \"love it love it\" with the spice the 2 younger girls said HOT!! and grabbed for drinks. Will make again for them but will totally cut the cayenne down by half.",

I'll check again at the store this week and then update my review. Couldn't get yellow squash and no other squash was going to slice up similar to the zucchini. It IS quite a bit hotter than you might expect but the flavor is very good. If you're not fond of spicy you might want to go easy on the cayenne the first time you try this. I grilled mine using the foil inside a veggie grilling basket for 30 minutes which was at least 10 minutes too long. It was overdone. Still tasted good but next time I'll set the timer for 20 minutes and test it. Thanks for this. Nice alternative to the usual grilled side.",
