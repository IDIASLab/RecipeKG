It may have added extra flavor but to tell you the truth, I didn't notice an appreciable difference than those I've made without the onion. I prepared the recipe pretty closely, only adding a couple dabs of tomato paste since my tomatoes weren't as ripe as I would have liked them to be.  That proved to be a great addition! Loved the flavor boost it provided. I topped each serving with an herbed crostini and fresh basil for garnish. Fresh, simple and satisfying.  And pretty too!",

After 20 min we took an immersion blender to it, and then finally put in the cream and simmered down. Was excellent with grilled cheese on crusty bread on a chilly fall afternoon!",
