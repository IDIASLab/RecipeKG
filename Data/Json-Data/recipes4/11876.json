You're using grain alcohol, for cryin' out loud! There are many Krupnikas recipes out there. This seems like a good one...similar to mine with the exception of a few spices that I leave out and a few others I put in. (For example, I use vanilla bean vs vanilla extract and I put it in the pot with the other spices.) Also, I never drink it warm...cool is best...but my Krupnikas is a full 80 proof. It's the real deal, made for shots. The basics are there, though...so if you're making this for the first time, don't sweat it if you're missing an ingredient or 2. Most can be found on line at good spice websites like Penzeys. To a previous comment: Everclear IS grain alcohol...whatever brand you have works fine.",

Even after settling overnight it has a luscious taste but it is quite cloudy. I plan to let it sit 3 weeks and have a little on Christmas and then keep the rest for at least a year to mellow.",
