I was concerned that the outcome would be bland because tomato sauce, spinach and sour cream don't have much taste.  As a result, I flavored the hamburger with Accent, garlic salt and onion powder as it browned.  That's the only change that I made.  I served it with salad and garlic bread.  Thanks, KDB for a great recipe!",

It still tasted sort of bland and I think that is because I used unseasoned tomato sauce. I then added some oregano and about 1/4 cup of chianti and I really liked the taste. I blended all the ingredients and then topped with the cheese. I used a mixture of equal parts mozzarella cheddar jack and crumbled feta. Everyone in the family loved it but my husband thought it needed a bit more zing and he suggested adding some sliced black olives and perhaps some diced tomatoes. I'm not so sure about the tomatoes but I think the olives would give it the perfect taste. I'll try that next time!",

I used more than a cup of cheese because I love cheese. It ended up being a real comfort food not fancy but warm and cheesy. I really liked it and my fiance did also.",

I modified it just a little - I browned onion & garlic with the ground beef.  For seasoning I used 1tbsp Italian seasoning instead of the thyme. In addition to the sauce I added a can of diced tomato. I did use the sour cream. I used fresh spinach (matter of preference, shouldn't change the flavor) and I put that in with the beef & sauce before adding to the oven pan. I used a mix of mozzarella & cheddar to use up open packages of each. Used shells (can't find w.w.bow tie pasta). We loved it with these modifications, we found it dry & bland otherwise.  Hope you like it :)",
