Puree a can or two of chipotles in adobo. Put in a jar, keep refrigerated & then you can call it \"chipotle paste\". I add a spoonful to broth when making soups. Also, use this same recipe and instead of chipotles use a basil pesto sauce. Excellent over linguine or fettucine.",

The first being that I didn't use the butter (I didn't think it was necessary with the richness of the other ingredients), added a can of mushrooms and I added slivered onions for the last 40 minutes of cooking. I increased the broth to 3/4 cup to make up for the loss in liquid. I also solved the issue some people had with the \"chunky\" sauce without having to pre-heat all the sauce ingredients. I heated my broth in the microwave for about a minute. I then added the cream cheese chunks and cooked at 20 second intervals until it softened somewhat. I then put the broth/cream cheese, soup and peppers in the blender and hit pulse until it was blended and creamy. The sauce went into the crockpot with the frozen chicken breasts and a small can of sliced mushrooms (drained) and was done about 40 minutes later. We served it over rice and it was a hit! Thanks for the recipe :) I know this recipe would have been just as great as written but we're trying to cook a little healthier.",

Next time I'll warm up the cream soup broth adobo sauce and butter in a saucepan on medium heat then whisk in the cream cheese until it's thoroughly blended. Then I'll put the remaining ingredients in the slow cooker and pour the sauce over it all. Something is still off though. Maybe it needs something strong but light to balance the heaviness of the smoke and the richness of the cream cheese; I'm thinking fresh ground coriander seed. Definitely needs chopped cilantro and onions at the table to perk it up.",
