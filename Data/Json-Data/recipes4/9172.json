Recipe doesn't say to do this, but do spray your pan/dish with cooking spray to avoid sticking.   I always have Hawaiian rolls in the freezer, so although this was a quick breakfast today, I could just as easily see this as breakfast-for-dinner, as well.  When putting this together, I wondered if the bread cubes were too big, but that was not the case.  If anything, those big, baked, soaked bread cubes made this even more moist and tender.  Thanks for sharing, this one definitely will be made again.",
