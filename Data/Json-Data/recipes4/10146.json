The taste was still great if you want a nutty dense bread which is really healthy. All of which was my goal. Second time I made this bread I increased the flour to 3 cups (2 cups stone ground whole wheat and 1 bread flour) and I always substitute powder buttermilk. Reduced the water to 1 1/4 cups. The loaf did not have the slight cave in and the taste was still great however I preferred the original set of ingredients. Too much water in a loaf this dense equated to a more moist bread. Definitely a recipe which I will use again. Love the 3/4 cup of Flax seed mill. Thanks for sharing.",
