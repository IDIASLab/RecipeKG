I just didn't feel like cooking and thought that if it didn't taste good it was not a long list of expensive ingredients. Scaled to 3 servings. Added tsp. each garlic and onion powder. Only had diet coke with lime but thought that would work well. While it was cooking it didn't smell all that great. What a surprise when I lifted the lid and tasted the sauce and couldn't believe the depth of flavor! I have quite a descriminating palate and couldn't believe how good this was for being a simpleton recipe! Served with some basmati rice and fresh steamed broccoli and it was a great meal. The chicken itself was nice and tender. Used 3 deskinned bone-in breasts.",
