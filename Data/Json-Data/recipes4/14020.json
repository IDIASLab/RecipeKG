I made some slight variations but didn't change too much:   I thought it would make a better stew than a soup, so I only used 1 - 1/2 cups of chicken broth rather than 3 cups.

It is really great.  The taste is soup (very celery tasting, which I like.) But the texture is stew so I added more water. Changes:  More spices, cause I like that.  Also threw in some green beans and pretty much any leftover veggie I had.  Also, I used all chicken stock and only used water to bring it to a consistency I liked. Good as is though.

I now use the full amount of potato but have increased the chicken stock and water by 1 cup each. I start with the called-for amount of each spice then add according to taste after the first boil. Celery salt makes a good addition. I still double the broccoli but I hold half of it out and right before I serve the soup I flash-steam it for about 2-3 minutes in the microwave then add it to the soup. That bright green of the broccoli makes the soup look extra appetizing.",
