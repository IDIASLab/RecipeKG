My husband and the adult step-son raved about it but my finicky taste buds still compare it to the first and best Pastitio I ever tasted in a popular local Greek restaurant - it was made with hamburger also. I suspect they probably catered somewhat to American tastes so my frame of reference is most likely a little skewed. However I think I trust others taste buds a bit more than my own and this has never failed to please. Thanks for submitting the recipe Eleanor!",

I did overhear their bragging that they ate \"Pitaki\" for dinner AND Lamb which I did use. For pasta I used two Mac N' Cheese boxes folding the cheese powder into the hot meat mixture prior to refrigerating. In place of the parmasean I used garlic parmesan cheese which added to the garlic flavor. Cinnamon is mostly used for baking in my home so I was reluctant to use it. However I did and I'm not sure what its purpose was since you can't taste it. I am sure though it would not have come out right without it. Made for great leftovers! The recipe looks scary but it was pretty easy to follow and execute with minimal dishes used.",
