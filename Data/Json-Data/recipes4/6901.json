Shouldn't have baked it.\" Would've been much happier if we'd get heated the chili and layered it in a bowl w/ cheese and the Fritos, rather than baking, b/c the whole thing just turned way too dry. I used a previously-frozen homemade chili, and since it's the \"starring\" ingredient, I'm glad that I used it as this recipe really is only as good as one's chili. The combo of chili, cheese, onions, and Fritos is fantastic (cilantro on top for me too!); we just weren't thrilled w/ the results from it having gone into the oven.",

I think this would have been better had my chili had a little more liquid allowing the bottom layer of fritos to soften a bit. Also oven temperatures vary so I ll start checking mine at 10 minutes the next time as mine dried out a little. Nice to have a new way to serve leftover chili and it was enjoyed today for lunch. This is really pretty good and soooo easy. Would make again!",
