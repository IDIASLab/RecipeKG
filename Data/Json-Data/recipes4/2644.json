I always double it now and use a 1/3 cup batter per pancake.  My alterations:  All organic ingredients, 3 tablespoons sugar instead of 2,  and brown sugar instead of the substitute.   Ive made them several times and the recipe proportions are great.  As is, you will have a bouncy, very thick pancake.  Sometimes the family wants thin pancakes and I add 1/4 cup milk (for base recipe- double this for a double recipe).  My recommendation is to use fresh ground flour!  Use soft wheat berries.  We love this recipe better than my old one!",

I've used ripe bananas, blueberries, blackberries, and even used just cinnamon/nutmeg/cloves/vanilla when I didn't have any fruit.  You can sub some or all while flour if you are running low or have picky eaters.  I even use vanilla soy milk to add that hint of vanilla and sweetness.  I use Splenda instead of packet sweeteners and find that 1/4c of Splenda does the trick.  These are so good you can eat them without any syrup!  I usually make a double batch and put the extras in the fridge or freezer.  Just pop in micro or toaster and you are good to go! You don't even have to worry about overly juicy fruit, like if you use frozen, because I usually end up using more than the cup of milk and the juice makes up the difference.  I absolutely love this recipe and it is SO easy to mix, match, change, add and still I have yet to have a bad batch!  I even keep them warm in the oven while cooking other items and they still turn out great!  Top with some sugar free syrup and it is the best \"healthy\" breakfast that the kids won't even notice there's no added sugar!",
