I cut the chicken down to 1 1/2 pounds and added a fresh stir fry mix of snow peas broccoli and carrots. I didn't have apricots (just the jam) so my husband suggested throwing in some raisins instead. I'm glad he did I think its what made it as good as it was and no chopping apricots. We do much prefer the apricot Glazed Chicken from this site which is very similar. Another tbs cornstarch a tbs of soy sauce and mare another 4oz of jam or a little less broth and this would be 5 stars all the way.",
