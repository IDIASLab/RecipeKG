They were a little mushy so in order to cook them on an outdoor grill I had to lay down tinfoil and spray with some Pam... but it totally worked. My boyfriend is a ketchup fan and was hesitant to eat a burger without it but LOVED them and asked that I suggest others put Sour Cream on them as well as it makes it perfect!

The pico de gallo sauce was fantastic and really made this recipe stand out. In fact next time I will make a little more of the pico de gallo because I couldn't stop eating it. Served with mexican rice and chips makes for a nice mexican style meal. Thanks!",
