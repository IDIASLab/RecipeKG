I made some changes (I hope you don't mind Kris) -I used a handful of parsley in place of spinach, I used an envelope of onion soup mix, I used just one whole egg and then one egg white to lighten it a bit, and I used oats as my filler rather than bread crumbs, par usual.  I had to leave some things the way I normally do or my kids would not have eaten it!  However many changes I made, the basic recipe is still a winner, and no matter how you dress it up to your own taste, this is one DELISH meatloaf, hubby and kid-approved!\nI also used the leftovers (as recommended by Kris) to make spaghetti sauce- I started with my usual homemade sauce, then crumbled the meat into it and let it simmer for an hour.  It was great!",

The wheat germ is a really great way to get extra nutrients in without sacrificing taste. I added some Mexican Seasoning to mine the first time and Thai Style Green Curry Spice Blend the second time. Both were phenomenal. Update - I ran out of ketchup and substituted Sweet Baby Rays Hickory Brown Sugar barbeque sauce. I also used Montreal Seasoning. Tasted even better than the ketchup.",

How shocked I was to find a recipe that used both. I printed out the recipe and handled it to my DH who prepared it. He used green bell pepper instead of red and wasn't reading well so we ended up with some honey in the meatloaf too. Delicious! Using a baking pan instead of a loaf pan make it crispy and yummy. Thanks for a great recipe and something very different from our average meatloaf. My only change because it is just the two of us would have been to make 2 loaves instead of one. I can hardly wait to figure out what I am going to do with the leftovers.",

I think I'd also puree the veggies in the food processor instead of dicing and cooking them. I baked in my meatloaf pan since I hate to pass up a chance to use the thing (I use it so rarely!). Still we enjoyed this. Bf added salt and pepper to his--apparently he thought he needed some more--but I thought it was good on it's own. Thanks for the recipe!",
