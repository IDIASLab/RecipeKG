I did feel that the cider made it overly sweet, so i added savory flavors such a bay leave, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, a dash of worcester sauce, and basil. Also, if i did it again, i would use beef stock as the addition at the end instead of water. Sweet potatoes were also a wonderful addition to the flavor mix. Will definitely be cooking every year for the fall!",

First of all, I tossed the beef with flour and spices and then put in the slow cooker. I did not wait until beef was cooked before adding the juice mix to the beef. I added Worcestershire sauce, savory, more thyme, dried basil and 2 beef bouillon cubes to the cider before putting the juice in my crock pot. I let the broth and beef cook for 1 hour before adding my veggies. I used baby potatoes, sweet potato, brussel sprouts in addition to the ingredients in the recipe. I let this cook on high for another 3 hours and it came out AMAZING. I will be making this often. Thank you for the recipe.",

I fudged and used more potatoes than I should have, and added some mushrooms. The way I thought of this recipe was that it was pot roast, plus cider minus the crockpot. And more potatoes for me is always a good thing. But that meant I had to add more liquid -- a bit more cider and a bit more water. I really wasn't sure about the apples in the stew itself, but it turned out perfect.   I think some of the amounts seemed small, like the amount of flour needed to coat the meat, or the black pepper. I'm a fresh black pepper fiend, so I made sure to add lots more pepper. Mmm. Tasty. Good counterpoint to the sweet.",

I followed the recipe pretty well, but used beef broth instead of H2O.  I used fresh thyme and needed a lot of it to have any flavor. I doubled the recipe and it turned out great.  My husband is an executive chef and he gave it 9 on a zero to ten scale!  The stew is very filling!!  Use fiji or an apple that will hold up when cooked.  An apple like Macintosh will turn to mush.  The beef turned out extremely tender.  Very yummy.  Didn't give 5 stars because I reserve that distinction for \"to die for\" recipes and this is good, but not a 5. I would consider adding a few green beans next time to give it more color.  It's kind of a gray color. Try it!",
