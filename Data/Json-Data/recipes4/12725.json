To misfit and others who find the juice to be to greasy...This is a very old trick my Grandmother used to do, float a couple of lettuce leaves on top off the juice before placing the sliced meat back in the juice. The lettuce soaks up the grease. Keep doing this until all the grease is gone. MUCH faster than placing juice in the fridge to congeal. I have done this for years! Also, should one find anything too salty, place a pealed potato in what ever, cook for a while, then remove the potato. DON'T EAT potato as it will be very salty. Both of these suggestions are from my Grandmother. She was the BEST cook ever!!  ",

I strained the juices through a sieve to remove the onion, and refrigerated them so the fat would congeal at the top for easy removal.
