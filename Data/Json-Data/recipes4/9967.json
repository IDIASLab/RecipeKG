I drain add in 1 TBS montreal steak seasoning (salt free), worstershire sauce, black pepper, red pepper flakes and a small dash of salt.  I add in 1/2 of a large block of velvetta cheese- cubed, 1 can rotella tomato and mild chilis, 6 dill stackers - diced, 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 milk   and cook on the stove top till the cheese melts and it gets all gooey.   I fill the pre-baked pie shell and top it with slices of Kraft American Singles, baking for about 10 minutes until the cheese on top melts.  It's absolutely amazing!\n\nOn occasion I will cut the pie crust into circles, put them into a greased muffin tin and pre-bake. I use about 2 TBS of the meat mixture for each \"muffin\". Instead of baking for 10 minutes I just broil till the cheese slices get brown and bubbly.\n\nI've also stuffed the meat mixture into the pie crust and made mini turn-overs - they're great with cocktails!  Since the meat mixture is already cooked just follow your pie crust directions for turn overs -- about 6 minutes in a 425 degree oven.",

Based on mixed reviews I wasn't expecting much but after we ate my husband said \"You'd better get on that site of yours and tell them it's a good one\"! I'm not a big fan of pastry crusts so I used reduced fat biscuits and unrolled them along the bottom of a 9\" pie pan. I then par-baked it for about 9-10 minutes (firm but not browned). While it was baking I browned the meat/onion/garlic mixture and followed the rest of the recipe as is (w/less cheese you don't need a full 2C). I used skim milk extra lean ground beef 2% cheese and it was still excellent. DON'T skip the pickle juice that's what makes it \"special\". Next time I will try w/baby bella mushrooms and Swiss (oh I used Cheddar this time because I was too lazy to shred Swiss!). BTW: 2 dill spears diced = 1/3 C. Thanks for a great weeknight meal!",

                "reviewBody": "As is I give this recipe 3 stars. With some improvements it could go to 4 stars. My biggest problem is that the pickle taste overwhelms the entire recipe. Next time I would forgo the pickle juice. My second problem is that the mixture is too runny and did not set well in the pie crust. My guess is by omitting the pickle juice you could solve both of the above problems. My next change would be to switch from swiss to cheddar. And finally add 1 can of tomatoes as other reviewers also noted.",
