Make sure to use real cheese, as the powdered stuff in the green can has a lot more sodium, and will cause the dip to be salty! 2.)If you don't like spicy, or if a lot of kids will be eating this, I would use about 2 oz. of jalapenos. If you like a little kick but not overpoweringly spicy, 4 oz is the way to go. If you can't get enough of the heat and like almost-inedibly spicy, you can try 6 oz. 3.) The best thing I have found to dip in this is sliced french or sourdough baguette. 4.)Also, if you want to use fresh jalapenos, it gives a wonderful texture. Enjoy!!!",

                "reviewBody": "Three stars as is but five stars with some easy changes. Having made this recipe several times before, I recommend the following changes/ additions: Substitutie 1 ( 8 oz) package of soft cream cheese, and 1/4 cup of sour cream to replace mayo (mayo is too sweet and sour cream adds a needed tang), bake this in a greased casserole dish instead of a bread bowl and then serve with toasted french baguettes (dough wont get soggy then and dip forms a golden brown layer on top).  Divide the parmasen cheese into two half cups.  Incorporate one 1/2 cup with the cream cheese mixture and save the other 1/2 cup for a topping (also my addition).  Mix 1/4 tsp garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste into cream cheese and sour cream mixture.  For the topping, combine 3/4 cup Italian bread crumbs, the 2nd 1/2 cup of parmesan, 4 TBS melted butter and salt and pepper to taste. Once you have transferred the dip to the baking dish, spread the bread crumb mixture evenly over the top. Bake uncovered in a 350 oven for 30 minutes (or until the top is bubbly and golden brown).  Serve with toasted baguettes.  I would highly recommend doubling this recipe for a crowd.  I always run out even after doubling and literally have people licking the bowl.  SO GOOD! Thanks!",
