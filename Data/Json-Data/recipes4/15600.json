If I make them again I will add 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and cream together with the butter and still add 2 cups total of the powdered sugar and increase the water to 5 tablespoons to balance it out. I would want to keep the light crisp texture that Milano cookies are known for; the powdered sugar gives these cookies that texture.",

And now that I've just tasted one I definitely think that they're nice and light and the changes rebeccasatc suggested were spot on. I would however cut the almond extract in half the next time I make them. Whatever brand I used may have a stronger flavor than others but I found the almond flavor a little too overpowering in each bite. Otherwise great tasting with the changes!",
