Rounded out the sausage with some bacon bits. Used monterey jack blend instead of mozzarella. The flavor turned out OK...and still on the salty end so glad I followed that advice. But the texture was not appealing at all The potatoes were just mush on the bottom where they had settled out and the cheese was mostly on the top in a tougher crust. Won't be trying this one again.",
