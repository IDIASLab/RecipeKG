I used a bison flat iron steak and after browning, took it out and sliced it against the grain during the next step of the process.  That is, after giving it a 10 minute rest before slicing. I put the sliced bison back into the pot and proceeded with all of the steps as directed. I shredded it while the slurry was working its magic and returned it to the pot after it was reduced. I used a mid level Merlot for the wine. This should really be called a stew - whatever you call it it\u2019s excellent!",

I followed this recipe to the letter but, perhaps, another 5+ minutes pressure cooking may have made a difference in tenderizing the beef, not sure?  I use flank steak a lot for stir fries, but the key to tender flank steak  is in slicing the meat on the bias, not an option when you\u2019re shredding beef.  The recipe doesn't say to saute the meat with any oil, but I did add some avocado oil to the pot.  The recipe submitter says other cuts of tough beef may be used, and in this case, I think I\u2019ll opt for chuck roast in the future..  I can trim the fat, it\u2019s always flavorful, and costs a heck of a lot less than flank steak.  Good, but wasn\u2019t wow\u2019d by this one.",
