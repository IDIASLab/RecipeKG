If you haven't made or tried pickled eggs before this is a great place to start. It's a very standard recipe and very flavorful. It's what I think of when I think of pickled eggs (could be bc my family is from Quebec!). I love the use of fresh ginger. The brine has a sort of pickling spice flavor but better. This is not too vinegary at all. I ate an egg the next morning and it was already delicious. If you want even more flavor leave the ginger and other spices in the jar instead of using the cheesecloth.",
