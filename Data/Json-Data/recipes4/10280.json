I used orange Duncan Hines cake mix for extra orange flavor and followed the directions exactly except I only made half the recipe for icing. It really needs the whole recipe of icing but needs more orange flavor too. The lemon only seemed to negate the orange flavor so I made an extra cup of icing without the lemon & added 1/4 t orange flavoring. Much better. I poured the icing over the hot cake while still in the pan & inverted after 10min.",

If making cupcakes or another non-inverted cake let the cake cool a little before pouring glaze on top. As another reviewer suggested I changed the water to OJ and added a 1/4 tsp orange extract. I might even increase it to 1/2 tsp or more next time and will omit the coconut. It is not very good in this recipe to me but if you are looking to use up coconut I would increase it. As it is the coconut is kind of random and sparse.",
