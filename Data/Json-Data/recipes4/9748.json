I made it for my co-workers, threw it together the night before and took it to the office in the slow cooker for lunch.  As soon as they tasted it they couldn't believe how good it was.  Word spread fast around the office and 15 people asked me for the recipe.  The ONLY thing I changed was the half & half,  I used 1 small container of it and the rest was a combination of skim milk and whole milk.  A couple of people thought it was a bit salty so next time I would replace the bouillon with beef broth.   Otherwise this is an excellent soup worth trying.  5 + stars!!!!!!!!",
