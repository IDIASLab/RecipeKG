Like reviewers have said modify the balsamic if you're not big fan of the acidity. I'm not so good with the measurements of my recipes:/ I just throw everything in my processor so you may need to play around with the amounts I've given. I often don't add all the water depending on the consistency of the garbanzos from the can. I usually add it little by little and stop when it gets where I want it. Also it tends to thicken a bit in the fridge as it sits because the beans absorb a little more but you can always add a little water or olive oil after it sits for awhile.",
