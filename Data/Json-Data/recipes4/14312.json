They were VERY light and flaky and wonderfully thick. My only changes to the crust recipe... substituted a couple tbsp butter when I ran out of shortening AND substituted 1 tbsp white vinegar for part of the chilled water (my grandma's trick for flaky crust). I also baked it at 450F for the first 10-15 minutes to brown the crust. Perfect! The filling was tasty and very easy with frozen veggies and canned soup.

I didn't have any cream of potato soup but I had cream of celery and used that instead. My husband who is very picky and doesn't like casserole type dishes went crazy.

I sauteed the onion and turkey in 1 tablespoon of olive oil for about 2 minutes just till onions were clear. Then I added the soups and mixed in 1/2 can of water from each can (for a total of 1 can). I simmered the turkey mixture for about 10 minutes till it started bubbling. While that simmered I let the 2 pie crusts from the box come to room temperature then laid one crust in a pie baking dish. Filled it with the turkey mixture until just below the edge and covered with the 2nd crust. Crimped the edges together slit in the middle and baked in oven at 375 degrees for 45 minutes. Better than store bought pot pie! I will definitely make this again!",

My son 3 1/2 he poked all the things separately. We had half the pie leftover. My parents warmed it up and thought it was superb. Mom thought brandy added to the sauce or sauteed mushrooms would be great additions. I might try that next time along with reducing the amount of peas.",
