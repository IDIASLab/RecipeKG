One with regular paprika and added a little grated parmesan cheese (1/4 to 1/2 tsp - I really didn't measure). The other I used smoked paprika and added 1/8 tsp. of chili powder.  Both were fabulous! I partially microwaved the potatoes vs. boiling which is much easier and a lot faster.  I used Olive Oil Pam to make the seasoning stick. When I cut the potatoes into wedges I very lightly scored them. They came out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, perfectly seasoned and great with a side of sour cream! Great recipe!",

Sprayed cookie sheets with olive oil pam added a single layer of potatoes and sprayed those with pam and sprinkled the seasonings on top. Baked in the oven at 400 for about an hour. They were a little dry so I put them in a covered casserole dish with about a Tbsp of water and microwaved on high for 2 minutes. The water steamed the already cooked potatoes and made them moist. The second way I cooked the potatoes was to just spray a casserole dish with olive oil pam spray the potatoes while on a cookie sheet and season and add to the casserole dish. I cooked them in the microwave for about 20 minutes on high stirring halfway through. Put the potatoes in a foil pan on the grill to keep hot while burgers were cooking. Kids and adults loved them.",

I peel slice and lightly coat in EVOO then essentially cook in the microwave for 6 minutes removing and shaking the loosely covered container the fries are in. Once done with the microwave toss with seasonings and bake for about 30-45 minutes once they get crispy. This way they are tender on the inside but crisp on the inside. You can also add some cornstarch to the mix (roughly 1 tablespoon) to ensure crispiness. I doubled the seasonings for roughly 8 really small potatoes. I used a hot chili powder instead of cayenne celery seed instead of the celery salt and added a half teaspoon of salt. It could have used a wee bit more spice and salt but it was mild enough for my toddler to enjoy too. We didn't serve it with sour cream... Ketchup and mayo is the way we flow.
