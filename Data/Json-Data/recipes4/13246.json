This one, however, complimented the flavor of the fruit PERFECTLY and had a great chocolate flavor on it's own, too.  I thought the consistency was perfect.  We dipped pound cake, bananas, marshmallows, strawberries, clementine oranges, cinnamon graham crackers and pineapple in it (my favorites were the strawberries and pineapple).  I will definitely make it again, it was so much fun, so easy and so good!",

I took 6 oz. of white chocolate (not vanilla chips) and melted it with maybe a teaspoon of shortening (not butter; butter contains water). I swirled the white chocolate in to make the fondue pretty. My dippers: strawberries fresh pineapple grapes apples (soaked in lime juice and dried) and angel food cake.",
