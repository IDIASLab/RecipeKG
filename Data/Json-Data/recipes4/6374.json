Also 6 tablespoons of onions? What am i supposed to do--chop the onions and take a tablespoon measure and measure the onions out 6 times? And raw almonds or any nuts don't ever add much to a dish for me--toast them? and it's all the difference in the world. I compliment the person who put this together because it's a really nice combination of flavors. I added a chopped boiled egg--and used Vidalia onions for a sweeter and not overpowering onion taste.",

Served over a bed of lettuce without the pasta as a sandwich ( I love this stuffed into a pita) or mounded on crackers ( Triscuit is a fantastic choice for this) this always hits the spot on a hot summer day when ease a light fare and coolness are just whats needed. If I'm out of almonds walnuts work just as well.",
