I did an \"experimental\" slow cooker version I used a huge sweet potato cubed and two idaho cubed for the botom layer of the crock added fresh cut green beans and added all of the other veggies raw and large diced on top. I browned the beef with that wonderful garlic and some Montreal seasoning added to the crock and added ground celery seed (my secret ingredient for all veggie based soups and stews!) ground pepper to the mix. I added two cups beef broth (instead of one cup water) and a cup of white wine to the mix since I was slow cooking and a little concerned about drying out. This stew was savory and delicious after 9 hours on low and very brothy plenty of liquid. Sincere thanks to you and your family & mom for sharing this recipe dolcevita you have a winner here!",
