Trimmed off the little bit of excess fat before putting into cooker, and I turned it over every couple of hours because it was so big.  End result was juicy & tasted great.  This made a huge amount - at lest 36 servings- and cost less than $10 for the meat. It freezes well & if you freeze it flattened out in a freezer bag it thaws quickly & makes a good last minute meal.  Eat it on buns or not,  have extra bbq sauce for those who like lots of sauce.",

However getting there was like getting Little Red Riding Hood to go to Grandma's;-) And I grin on this because I made everything on this recipe from scratch...no kidding. Went for dry onion soup mix was out...came to AR got the recipe and made it..YES! Then was out of BBQ sauce crud-ola'! Okay made that too from scratch as well thanks to another AR'er here named Georgi that's a dear friend of mine and gave me a recipe she's been making for 30 years and it was prefect just made enough to complete this recipe. It's all good had I had just the basics already when I was making this..it couldn't have been any simplier. The only draw back I saw was this morning when pulling the meat out to shred it was the meat on the very bottom had scrotched and I had to discard those pieces. I could have easily put on low and been able to save some of the meat durning the night by moving the meat around to prevent that but that wasn't the case. Do watch the meat closely. However the recipe turned out great even though I had to take additional steps to get this recipe done. And it was worth it because my family asked for me to make it again. And I have soo much. This batch makes alot. I also used boneless country still ribs verses bone in because it's what I had purchased. There wasn't much discarded or wasted at all. TY it's a repeater.",

Over time I've developed a couple of tweaks based on experimenting with other recipes.  I usually use about 1/2 of a large bottle of barbecue sauce (at  least 12-16 oz), 8 oz of non-diet cola (plain ol' Coke works best), and the onion soup mix to cook the meat in.  The cola adds a little sweetness and helps to tenderize the meat. When the meat is done, I drain off the liquid, saving it, and shred the meat and put it back in the cooker. I pour about a cup of strained reserved meat liquids and the other 1/2 bottle of sauce over the meat and mix well. Let the meat heat through about 30 minutes more. Serve additional barbecue sauce on the side. The key is to taste your end product after you shred the meat and add more sauce to your family's taste.",

Followed the recipe but used more BBQ Sauce in the initial mix due to my larger amount of ribs. Added a heaping teaspoon of Harissa (Chili Paste) and let it cook in the slow cooker all day. I did not add the full amount of BBQ Sauce at the end of shredding. We don't like our pork swimming in sauce. I did not add it back into the slow cooker for the second time. It was time for dinner and once shredding was done - I served this. Easy. Good. Worked great! Thanks for the recipe!",

I love anything I can cook in in the Slow Cooker. I have learned that my Slow Cooker cooks hot so I have to reduce the time to prevent overcooking. alike the previous reviewer I also make my Barbecue sauce from scratch (thanks to AllRecipe cook SUZANNE2802). My question about this recipe is what is the need to use a second bottle of barbecue sauce? What do you do with the sauce placing into a bowl after cooking the meat? There is plenty of Barbecue sauce left. Could it not be placed back in the Slow Cooker after pulling the meat?",
