In 30 minutes check the oven temp by setting it to bake at 325 degrees.  If your oven is below 325 and begins to heat up your oven either has a vent fan or cools off too quickly.  No problem.  Set it to 275 and leave it for the next hour.  You are now at 1.5 hours after the blast.  Turn oven off for the last half hour.  Perfection.  If your oven is over 325 one half hour  after the first half hour blast you should be good with original recipe.",

While the meat was coming to room temp I also let my butter sit out to soften. I placed the butter in a small bowl, added about 1 Tbsp of extra virgin olive oil, 4 tsp of coarse kosher salt, 2 tsp freshly ground black pepper, 6 minced garlic cloves, and 2 tsp of thyme. (We don't care for Herbs de Provence.) I mixed this up with a fork then slathered the meat all over with it. I roasted the meat for 20 minutes at 500 degrees to get a nice crust, then I reduced the oven temp to 325 and continued roasting for another two hours. This gave us meat which was almost well done. It was still absolutely delicious this way, and perfectly flavored and juicy. Served with some twice baked potatoes and green beans. Perfect meal!",

It's the cooking method that is the key. It cannot be stressed enough, the roast MUST be at room temperature in order for this to work. If it is the least bit cold in the middle of the roast, you will come out with a very rare roast. A mistake I only made once because I was worried about leaving it out to get warm. Don't worry! It will be fine! I usually purchase 4.5 to 5 lb roasts and take it out of the fridge for a minimum of 5 hours to be sure it is room temp. It comes out absolutely PERFECT and juicy every time.",

I had no issue for many years until I got a new oven in 2012.  Many new ovens have a fan that comes on when you turn the oven off.  It quickly lowers the temp, which, obviously, will not work for this recipe.  Since I have a built-in oven, I  actually shut off the breaker to the oven so the fan doesn't come on.  Otherwise you can just unplug it.  I guarantee that was the problem with folks who had theirs come out rare!",

The only alteration I made was to do the math (# of lbs by 5 mins per lb) and then I added about 5 extra minutes to the total time (ie my roast needed 19.5 mins in the 500 F oven, and I did it for 25 mins) this was simply because I wanted some meat on the outside edge closer to medium (for me) and medium rare inside for hubby. The plan worked to perfection and gave us exactly what we wanted for a fantastic New Years Eve dinner. I have never been a huge fan of prime rib and this recipe has won me over. I'll prepare this again and again, a big hit!\n\n(I might cut back on the pepper next time, but this wasn't a huge issue, just personal preference\n\nI also made Chef John's Au Jus to go with this and it was incredible; like liquid gold as my husband said!\n\n)",

(Especially the dogs with their super hearing)  After 2 hours when I took it out, it was way, WAY too rare.  The only part that was cooked was the outside of it.  It also still had that wiggly consistency.  Had to cook it again the next day.  Was really awful, and we both like rare-ish roast beef!  Will never make this recipe again.  Sorry Chef.  Just wasn't edible to us and creeped me out looking at it.",
