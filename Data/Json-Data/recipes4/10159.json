My mom use to make this when I was growing up. We called it cabbage casserole. I still make it. I bake mine in the oven. After browning the meat and cooking the onion mix in chopped cabbage dump into large casserole dish and cover with undiluted soup sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake at 350 for about 30 min. Yumm-O! Tastes like cabbage rolls without all the fuss. Great with a crusty french bread and green salad.",

I added chili powder and garlic (will use something spicier next time tho)  and instead of tomato soup, I used stewed tomatoes and omitted the water.   I simmered it uncovered for the 20 minutes to help evaporate some of the juices.  I will make again....especially on these cold Canadian winter nights",

I'm embarrassed to say it but my husband and I finished the whole pot in one night - yikes! But it's so healthy. I did add some garlic while I browned the beef and then drained and rinsed the beef with hot tap water after it was done to get rid of the excess fat. (I do this all the time and you can't tell the difference). I added a few shakes of hot chili powder and also a few squirts of ketchup for some added flavor and a touch of \"sweetness.\" I did not use what I felt was a whole medium sized head of cabbage. I used about one-half and thought it was plenty. Will definitely make again - probably at least once a week! For those that won't use tomato soup becuse they don't like it. Try it! My husband doesn't like it as soup either but likes it in recipes.",

Thanks to other reviewers I too added a couple dashes of chili powder apprx 1/2 TBLS brown sugar and a few squirts of ketchup which definately added taste that I think it would have otherwise lacked. I used apprx 1 cup leftover rice (stirred right into the cabbage mix) and also used the pre-shredded coleslaw cabbage which saves on chopping time. Overall tasty and easy meal which I will make again when all the time I have is 30 minutes!! Thanks Tina!",
