I'm not sure if it's chili, or stew or a shepherds pie without the crust, but there is nothing like it over some toast on a cold night, rich and hearty, just downright yummy if you ask me. We always experiment a little with our ingredients but it always comes out great. I'm thinking of going and making a pot right now, oh and it's even better the days after you make it, just go ahead and microwave some, put it on baked potatoes, roll it up in bread, use it anyway you like.",

As suggested in the other reviews I added some corn carrots and frozen peas then created a cheddar-topped sheppard's pie. My brother and I were in heaven; he even got up the next morning and ate the leftovers before I could and this is a guy who won't ever touch leftover ANYTHING! So if you've just found this recipe and are reading this review here's my advice: TRY IT TRY IT TRY IT!!! You'll be amazed!:)",

Kat's description planted the idea of shepherd's pie in my mind so that's what I used the stew as a base for. I did take some other reviewers' suggestion and reduced the black pepper by 1/3 but that is the only change I made. I didn't simmer quite as long as the recipe calls for the second time. I made the stew in a large cast-iron skillet. When it was nearly done I added a layer of sliced carrots to the top then a thick layer of mashed potatoes to which I mad mixed in a little milk butter garlic powder salt and coarse pepper over that. I baked this in the skillet in the oven at 375 degrees for 30 minutes or so then added some shredded sharp cheddar to the top and baked another 15 minutes. The gravy baked up through the potatoes which were a nice golden brown...it was SOOOO good! My husband hates leftovers but the next day I warmed it up and made some homemade sweet cornbread to go with it and he was very happy. I'm going to make up a big batch to freeze in smaller portions for easy quick dinners after work. I would like to see more family recipes from Kat!",

After reading the reviews I used less pepper and after accidentally mis-reading the recipe I used a tablespoon of garlic powder (!) and it was still great. I substituted tomato sauce and stewed tomatoes for the ketchup as well. This is a very flavorful soup/stew that was reminicent of a beanless chili maybe. Delicious. Next time I'll double the recipe!

My family enjoyed it but we had to eat it with lots of bread or crackers to tame the pepper down! Next time we'll use just 1 Tbsp of pepper and keep everything else the same. Many of the recipes I find published are pretty shy about using spices and I almost always need to add some more oomph -- it's kind of refreshing to find one where I need to back off some!",

I did reduce the amount of pepper 2 tsps.and added a small amount of cayenne since so many had suggested using less and 3 T. seemed way to much for the average taste and it was still very spicy. I also used 1/2 T. curry and only one ex-large onion. I didn't have teriyaki so used worchestershire which worked and fixed it as a shepards pie by topping with mashed potatoes and shredded cheddar excellent. Will make many more times and I found it to still be quite spicy even with these changes.",

The first day we serve it on toast. The next day it will thicken up a bit so the leftovers become shepherd's pie. It's the traditional food for those on a tight budget.",
