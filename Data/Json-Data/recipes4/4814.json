Would need some changes.\" I prefer AR's \"Spinach Turkey Roll\" recipe to this one, both of similar ingredients and presentation, but something about this one didn't sit right w/ me. I'm not sure if it was the ketchup instead of spaghetti sauce on top, or the 'synthetically-seasoned' vibe of the Italian seasoning sprinkled on top at the end, but this pinwheel just didn't agree w/ my tastebuds. Only sub I had to make was fresh, torn baby spinach in place of frozen. The one thing that did make me waver on giving this a higher rating was marveling in astonishment as my 3-year old ate her entire plate. (Spinach - really?!? Dessert's on me!)",

I did add garlic powder in its place because I love garlic in everything. for the center layer: I used feta crumbles rather than shredded italian cheese (just something I love about spinach and feta together) and I added sauteed mushrooms onions & garlic to the feta/spinach mixture. for the topping: I didn't use the ketchup rather just some tomato paste and for the last 25 minutes of baking I topped the meatloaf with strips of turkey bacon then broiled it for the last couple minutes so the bacon got crispy. I had the turkey bacon on hand that I needed to use up and thought it was a nice touch to the meatloaf.",
