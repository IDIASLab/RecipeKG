                "reviewBody": "I started with dry chickpeas, rather than canned.  After  cooking, I followed the directions, allowing to dry for about 45 minutes.  I spread them in a layer on a towel to get them as dry as possible.  Following the directions exactly the first time resulted in a very crunchy snack, which my toddler loved, but which did not hold any of the seasoning.  After that, I have added a little olive  oil and salt after the 2nd pan shaking (i.e. after 20 minutes cooking). Then finish cooking as directed.  Sometimes them I cook an extra  5 minutes- I think it depends how dry I get the chickpeas before roasting.  Leaving them to cool in the oven for 2 hours does result in chickpeas that stay crispy for several days.  I store them in a mason jar, and they have stayed crisp up to 2 weeks (as long as it takes my son to eat them).  This recipe and technique has resulted in a staple snack for us.  Thank you for sharing it!",
