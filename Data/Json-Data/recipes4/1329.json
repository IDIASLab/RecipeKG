I was taught how to make a burger patty long ago. Make into a ball...then between your palms flatten the burger to where you want it....thick or thin. As you flatten it...keep turning the burger and gently squeeze the sides together to get ALL the air pockets out....dont make TOO thin or it will be tough. Its not like making meatloaf....you need to handle the burger more to get all the air out...wont have any cracking and wont have that \"ball\" problem!!! Good luck....",
