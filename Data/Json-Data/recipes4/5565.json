I couldn't find the spicy lamb sausage so I improvised: I used ground lamb and spiced it with minced onion and garlic cumin paprika and cayenne as well as salt and black pepper. This seemed easier than removing the casing from an already prepared sausage anyway. I considered skipping the cheese to cut down on the richness but decided to use feta instead of the goat cheese. It really added an interesting dimension so I am glad I didn't leave it out. Because I didn't have the small round squash pictured I used a larger elongated \"mediterranean\" squash and it took longer to bake. More like 40 minutes. Both my husband and I gave it 5 stars. I will definitely use this recipe again. Also I felt badly about tossing the scooped out squash so I sauteed some onion and garlic along with the chopped up squash added a half a seeded fresh tomato and stir fried the mixture with some cooked brown rice. It made the perfect side dish to accompany this meal.",

I cooked three medium yellow squash and I needed twice the amount of filling the original recipe calls for. Also the squash needed to bake for about an hour. I put foil over it for second half of the baking time so the filling wouldn't burn. Like other reviewers I used hot italian sausage. I also brushed olive oil over the squash and seasoned liberally with salt and pepper before adding the filling. Then I put a few pats of butter over the top of the bread crumbs.
