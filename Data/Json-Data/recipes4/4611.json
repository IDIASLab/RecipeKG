Why simmer canned beans for 8 hours and then discard the onion and garlic?  This caused everything at this point to be way over done (8 hours cooking on LOW).  Why add garlic salt when you've added fresh garlic cloves and kosher salt?  Increase the garlic cloves and kosher salt.  Lastly, by adding the sausage only long enough to smell the sausage fails to infuse it's flavor into the beans.  Bottom line, cook the whole thing except for the kale for about 4 to 5 hours.  That said, I made it again, added 3 chopped serrano peppers, 1 with seeds, increased the garlic cloves 8 fold and added the kale half way through.  To me, the secret here is to infuse all of these wonderful flavors including the sausage into the beans and kale.",

As other reviews suggested (and my slow-cooker intuition told me) I removed the sausage from casing and fried it with onions and put it in the very beginning. I didn't have broth so u used 2 tbsp of beef bouillon and to make it lower cal I used spicy turkey sausage. Also I left the onions and garlic in and upped them both (as well as the carrots and celery). The soup came out SUPER hearty healthy and flavorful despite being low-cal low-fat low-sodium. This was a great base for a recipe that I tweaked and fine-tuned.",
