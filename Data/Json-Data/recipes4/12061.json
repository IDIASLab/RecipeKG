I also though it was very bland and made a few changes.  I tripled the garlic, used tomatillos and not tomoatoes, and 1 cube of chicken bullion before boiling the ingredints.  When it was time to blend the ingredients together, I added 4 oz of diced tomatos & 4 oz green chilies, 1t cumin and about 1/3 bunch of cilantro and blended the ingredients together and then chilled. It came out very good!",

I used 7 jalapenos and 3 serrano peppers and boiled them in the beer (I made sure to test a few of them first to make sure the Corona was good) and added no water. I left the seeds of 5 peppers in the sauce. The heat was perfect but the sauce didn't have much flavor. Next time I'm going to roast the peppers and will update.",

I added all ten jalapeno peppers but I only added the seeds of five of them. I also added some cilantro a little more garlic than it called for and the juice from half of a lime. We ate it with our beef and bean chimichangas last night for dinner and it was so yummy. Will be making again for sure. Thanks for the recipe.",
