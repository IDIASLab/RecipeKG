I persoanlly like them about any way you can prepare them, but my husband does not like all the sugar and nuts that many recipes add. How happy was he to see BACON as a topping instead! ;)  I did not have light cream on hand, so I just combined some milk and meleted butter as a substitute and for the cream. I also used 6 sweet potatoes instead of 4. It turned out great.  Thank you so much for giving us a sweet potato recipe that leans more toward the savory side. It was a nice new twist to my traditional Thanksgiving meal!",

I cooked half an onion in my leftover bacon grease and combined it with the crumbled bacon to top... then I just added a couple tablespoons of the bacon grease and a little milk to get the right consistency since I didn't have time to bake so long.  the onion-y bacon grease gave it a great flavor!  I also only added the nutmeg since I didn't want to give it too many flavors... so good!",
