Plus this recipe is perfect for times when you want something simple and quick to put together.  I cooked my onion in olive oil vs. vegetable oil and since I had \"Seasoning for Tacos\" from this site already made I used a little of that for seasoning. Delicious in warm soft or hard shell tacos with all the fixin's - shredded cheese, chopped tomatoes, shredded lettuce, hot sauce and sour cream. Thanks for a great recipe Baker Bee!",

I intended this to be quicker than 6 hour crock-pot recipes, which was all I kept finding, and mild enough for children or adults. It shreds very easily and works great in a hard shell taco with lettuce, tomato, and cheese. Not an authentic recipe for shredded taco chicken, but a quick method for those pinched for time and want a healthier option, in addition to, or to serve with, traditional ground beef. Thank you for trying my recipe and this very easy method of cooking shredded chicken!",

I cooked the chicken in the crockpot since it was going to be a busy day. Because I used a crockpot I seasoned the chicken with cumin, chili powder, chicken bullion, garlic and some minced onion. Shredded the chicken up and then followed the rest of the cooking instructions. Served this with the usual toppings. Had enough to feed the boys and the rest of us with a little bit leftover for lunch. This makes awesome chicken quesadillas too! Family loved these. I'll be making this again.

So, I boiled the chicken meat and shredded it like directed but instead of simmering in the pot.  I combined the seasonings, onion and tomato sauce in the bottom of a slow cooker along with some garlic and a few splashes of chicken broth.  I then added the shredded chicken and mixed it well.  I While I prepared everything else, I set my slow cooker on 3 hours on low and let it stay on warm to keep it heated.  Turned out WONDERFUL!  I had leftovers in which I made a vegetable & chicken soup out of.  This is versatile and can be used in lots of different things, not only some tasty tacos... Thanks Baker Bee! :)",
