I also added fresh herbs as I have them growing in my garden and a low sodium soy. I chopped 2 green onions and used 2 cloves minced garlic. I was in a hurry so I could not marinate for long...so I let it sit in a freezer bag for an hour at room temp. Perfection!! The meat was tender and very flavorful. The extra whiskey really gives it a buttery soft taste and you can actually taste the whiskey. I hate recipes that use so little of the liquer you never really taste it at all. This way worked best. I then took the left over marinade and used it to deglaze a pan of sauteed mushrooms and onions to make a side dish. It was awesome. Will be using this all the time now for flat iron steaks. Thanks so much!",

Per another review I sauteed some mushrooms in butter & garlic until the mushrooms were a little brown then added the reserved marinade & brought it to a boil for a few min. I highly recommend the mushrooms...it brought out a gourmet flair to the dish. Restaurant quality can't wait to make it for guests thanks!:o)",
