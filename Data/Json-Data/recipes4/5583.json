I use almond oil instead of olive oil, although the saturated-to-unsaturated profiles are virtually identical. There's also a variation I've seen floating around where you use bacon grease instead of oil to make \"maple bacon kale chips\". I used 100% grade A syrup. Grade B is lighter and not as thick. If you like kale chips, this is a great variation to try.",

                "reviewBody": "I had made baked Kale chips before and was intrigued by this variation. I read the reviews and decided that I'd halve the maple syrup because I didn't want them to be too sweet. A ratio of 1 Tbsp. oil to 1 Tbsp. syrup seemed right and it was! However my \"bunch\" of kale was big I think because when cut and laid out in a single layer it filled two large cookie sheets. Even though I did whisk the oil and syrup to blend them in advance and tossed the torn kale pieces well to coat them (as if tossing a salad--I used a latex glove to cover my hand because that made even coverage easiest without a sticky oily hand--which meant I solved the last time's problem when I ended up with uneven texture--great flavour but some chips were a little chewy while others were crispy). Doubling the oil and syrup (2 T. each) to better coat the amount of kale I have and lowering the oven temperature by 25 degrees because after 10 minutes (alternating the sheets on top and bottom racks halfway through) some were almost burnt. Coating only two sheets' worth at a time also improves kale coverage. I used a small jar with ounce marking to both mix and measure oil/syrup mixture as I used it--worked marvellously. Shake sea salt over before baking. Very popular with everyone...even my four-year-old granddaughter! Will make again and often I expect!",
