While not typical this version is tasty. I used honey wheat bread & because of reviews syaing the batter was heavy I copied M.A.H. & used a liberal amount of butter-flavor Pam to fry them in. Hubby didn't think it would work but it did...beautifully! The crust was perfect... not greasy or heavy & they didn't stick although I did use a non-stick saute skillet. I served them w/ Michel Richard s Cold Cherry Soup (google the recipe) which was the perfect accompaniment. Thanks for the recipe Teresa Neff...we enjoyed it!",

This sandwich can be baked and broiled or fried in a pan, with or without Mornay or Bechamel sauce. Gruy\u00e8re is traditionally used and is a Swiss cheese, although camembert or brie can be used. The version served with the egg on top is called a \"Croque Madame\". Made with tomatoes it's a \"Croque Provencal,\" made with Bleu cheese a \"Croque Auvergant.\" So you see, as with any recipe, there are probably as many variations as their are cooks.",
