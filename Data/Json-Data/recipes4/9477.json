Just couple of pointers:1) beat eggs first and drizzle in a little at a time; 2)don't grease cookie sheet or puffs will flatten - use parchment paper instead; 3)bake at 425 for 10 mins then reduce to 350 and bake for another 15-20 mins or until moisture disappears 4)once moisture disappears, turn off the oven and crack open the door but leave them in a little longer to dry out completely;5)puncture small hole on side to allow any excess steam out before cooling completely on rack- this prevents soggines.",
