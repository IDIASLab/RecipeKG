I wanted it a little more saucy to serve over pasta so I added two 8 oz cans of tomato sauce. Great dish!! I realize I didn t follow the recipe exactly so I thank you for the idea!",

I then put the can of domatoes with green chilies in the pan along with another can of diced tomatoes seasoned with oregano and basil an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and a little water. I added all the other ingredients except the green bell pepper because I didn't have any. Cooked it on low for 10 mins. then added it all to the slow cooker.
