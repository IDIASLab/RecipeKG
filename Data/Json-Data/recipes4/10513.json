I greased up my hands with shortening to shape eclairsand made 36 bite size eclairs using a melon-baller for consistency. I cooked at 400 for 15 minutes then reduced temp to 350 for 15 more. Then i let cool on the baking pans insteadof transferring to a wire rack. I did not cut the slits in the side I used a corkscrew to poke holes once they were out of the oven for good and a ziplock bag with one end snipped off to fill. I ended up needin 1.5 5-oz boxes of non-instant pudding. For the frosting I just turned over and dunked into melted icing and flipped back over to let dry then drizzled the remaining frosting. Was a huge hit!! The best news one is only about 100 calories!",
