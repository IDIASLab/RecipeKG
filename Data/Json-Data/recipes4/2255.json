The combined flavours tasted just like the yummy take-out ones we craved, and were a lot healthier.  This was a great recipe, thank you!",

(i did this because, like others, i noted that it seemed a bit dry.) everything held together well during the frying process, without coating it anything in flour etc. also, rather than molding the mixture into balls, i patted them into patties about the size of the circle formed when you touch the tip of your middle finger to the tip of your thumb, about an 3/4 of an inch thick. this cut down on the frying time (and absorption of oil), and made neater pita pockets :). thanks for the great recipe!",

Very tasty and my husband said it was the best falafel he'd ever tasted although I thought it tasted like regular falafel (which I love and is a compliment for a vegan recipe). The recipe says it serves 6 but for my family (myself my husband and my three year old son) I had to double the recipe and had only 3 falafel balls left. When frying I had to dump the oil between the first and second batches because the falafel balls crumbled a bit in the oil. To solve this problem next time I think I'll put them in the oven which will cut alot of the fat too. I served them in a pita with tomatoes and tahini sauce with ketchup and had a side of roasted potatoes. Very yummy!!!",
