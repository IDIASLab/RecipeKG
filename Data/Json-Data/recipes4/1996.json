The changes I made to make it a 5 star recipe for us are as follows:\nFirst I soaked my Tilapia in milk for about 2 hours.\nI then coated the Tilapia with a highly seasoned flour mixture(seasoned pepper, granulated garlic, onion powder, paprika, powdered basil, celery salt, cayenne, ginger, thyme and lemon peel.\nI also added a hefty sprinkling of Kraft Parmesan Cheese. I sauteed the fish with a bit of minced garlic and extra EVOO, removed to the serving platter, and did not return to the skillet at all. I added the wine ( a Pinot Grigio, capers, lemon, tomato and a few sliced mushrooms. After whisking in the butter, I decided I needed more of a sauce... so I mixed up about 1/4cup of cream with 1 Tbsp. flour, blended it into the skillet and WOW!!!\nA bit of extra lemon and we had an amazing dinner the other night, one which I am planning on adding to the family cookbook.

Watch salting the fish, as the capers add a ton of sodium.  We'll be making this again, THANKS!!  UPDATE: Made this again, submitted pic, and used asparagas this time and it was even better!  We used frozen tilapia, which I don't recommend b/c it's fishier than fresh, but it was still good.  The filets were smaller and fell apart a little, o'well still yummy!",

That being said I do think this Easy Tilapia would be even EASIER if you change the process like I did. First I cooked my asparagus separately ahead of time and reheated it in the microwave. I didn't want to cook it with the tomato/wine mixture and then have to fish it back out to finish the sauce as the recipe instructs. Secondly once the fish is cooked why would you add it back to the sauce and then take it out AGAIN??? So to further simplify I cooked the tilapia and kept it in a warm oven while I made the sauce. I plated the tilapia and asparagus and topped them with the sauce. DELICIOUS and even EASIER!!",
