It's very similar to a Chicken Divan recipe (minus the rice) I like to make.\n\nI didn't have cream of celery soup, so I instead used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of broccoli cheese.  During the last 8 minutes I added shredded cheese and topped with croutons before putting it under the broiler.  It was fabulous.  I would also think that a box of dried stuffing mix (Stove top or similar) would also be a great addition.\n\nThanks - This will be a day after staple whenever we have pork roast or leftover tenderloins.",
