I can't believe someone only gave this two stars after they switched the entire recipe around. You must try this, but please follow the written instructions. My entire family loved this one and have dubbed this one of their \"allrecipes.com\" favorites. The only change that I recommend is to bake for 20 minutes after removing the foil, more if you want your potatoes softer. Twenty minutes uncovered after the initial baking period is perfect for scalloped consistency. I use minced garlic from a jar these days instead of dicing each time, and I used one level tablespoon. This was fabulous and easy to prepare. It doesn't get much better than this! I was concerned a bit about being too salty after sampling the spoon pre-dishwasher, but it worked out well in the end. Please do not judge this based on reviews that were written based upon alterations of this recipe. Make it as written, add at least ten more minutes of browning time at the end and you will be delighted! Thank you so very  much for this wonderful addition to my \"must make again\" recipe files. Perfection!!!! Cream of broccoli and cream of celery-SIMPLE. Don't sub with variations including cheese, or low sodium, etc. Make this as written and you won't be disappointed.",

I used 8 cups of extremely thin sliced red potatoes 1-medium yellow onion diced and 1 medium red onion diced 3 large cloves of garlic minced 1/2 cup of 2% milk 1/2 cup of half-n-half cream added 1/2 teaspoon of salt plus 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Only needed to saute' the onions for 3 minutes then saute'd the garlic for just 1 minute. By mistake I only used 2 cups of the shredded sharp cheddar cheese which my husband and I thought that was plenty of cheese. I also mixed together the sliced potatoes and the soup/cheese combination before adding it to the buttered pan. I like how that help to coat the potatoes nicely. Baked the taters for 1 hour and 25 minutes and after removing the foil I continued to bake the potatoes for another 10 minutes. Then let the taters set ontop the stove for 15 minutes so they'd absorb the sauce in the pan and sprinkled the top with some dried parsley before serving. I also wanted to add... the next time I do make these potatoes I'll most likely substitute the cream of broccoli soup for another creamed soup. It's just a preference on my part. What a nice side dish to serve with our Sunday dinner. Thank you metzstar for sharing your recipe!!",
