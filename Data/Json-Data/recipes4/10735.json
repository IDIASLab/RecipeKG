Instead of adding pasta however we usually add around 3 or 4 eggs and - this sounds wierd but - spinach! Once the spinach has wilted in the soup I add the cheese and I usually add a generous handful of romano and a dash of salt and pepper. With these changes not only do you have an extremely healthy soup you have a delicious one!",

I did substitute many of the ingredients but it turned out great anyway. My substitutions were: Angel hair pasta instead of ditalini Swiss cheese for Romano Dried parsley instead of fresh When I stirred in the grated Swiss cheese it melted in the water and the angel hair pasta started sticking to it. It was wonderful nonetheless when I felt like soup and found lots of eggs in the fridge. Thanks!",
