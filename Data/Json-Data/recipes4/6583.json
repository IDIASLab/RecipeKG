Instead of salsa, I added a 5 oz. can of El Pato (yellow can) because we like spicy.  I also added the full can of green chilis, drained.  Because it was only 1 lb. of meat, I shredded it right in the crockpot  (after 8 hrs) and turned it to high heat for about two hours with the lid off.   It made the most delicious carnitas!  This is a definite keeper and next time I will make the full recipe and freeze in serving sizes for two, for a quick, easy meal.  Thank you for sharing!",
