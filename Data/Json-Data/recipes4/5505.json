When I saw Jordan's last name, I knew I had to try this.  \n\nI made it exactly as designed, hoping to recreate the famous B*ltl*n* B*r wet burrito.  If you've had it you probably know that you can't find this anywhere else but in West Michigan. \n\nIt did not disappoint!  Yes, it's the gravy.  What a surprise.\n\nTo be sure, this recipe is not designed to be a Texas burrito, or a California burrito, and we got a kick out of some of the comments that tried to make this something that it wasn't designed for.  This is the West Michigan wet burrito.  It is heavy and delicious!  This is the best attempt I've run across to duplicate it.   Three of us down here in Atlanta, all native West Michigan, gave this 5 stars and two thumbs up.\n\nThat being said, we are going to experiment a little going forward.  We don't want to change the flavor, it's excellent and as designed!  We think there might be a little more beef and a little less bean.  This recipe turned out a little less dry than the real thing at B*ltl*n* and so I may try overcooking the beef and leaving the juice out of the diced tomatoes in the beef mixture.  Finally, we are going to try putting the lettuce, tomato, and onion in the burrito, putting all of the cheese outside, and then do a low broil instead of baking.   We will keep all of you West Michiganders posted.\n\nThanks Jordan!",

This was mild and more Midwesternized than TexMex. I don't know how this can only yield 4 burritos though as I got 8 and they were stuffed and I still had some filling left. I didn't have refried beans so I took a can of Ranch Style beans non-drained and smashed them up some and went from there. I mixed the bean/comino mix into the meat so all I had to do to build these was a scoop of beef/bean mix and some cheese then roll up and move on to the next one. I only used 2/3 a can of diced tomatoes and did add a pinch of kosher salt to the beef mix. I used medium spice canned enchilada sauce and a jar of brown gravy. I didn't have a lot of just Cheddar so I used a mexican cheese blend mix too. This was a nice mild dish and my husband raved. He is looking forward to taking the leftovers to work for lunch and sharing. We eat a lot of Mexican food and this passed our taste test. This was not my favorite but hubs loved it and had seconds so that makes it a keeper. My biggest complaint? It dirtied a lot of pots! Oh well the food is good and that is what matters most. Thanks I really enjoyed trying out this new recipe!",
