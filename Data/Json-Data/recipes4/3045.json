I baked these at 350 for 8 minutes turned them and baked for another 7 minutes. Everyone's oven is different so you may want to experiment with your first batch.

I was afraid it would be over seasoned but it was totally spot on! I make these quite a bit healthier by using just 1 tbs oil to have the spices form sort of a paste and spraying my tortilla's with Pam fat free olive oil spray before applying my seasoning paste. It spreads well and will still crisp up nicely yet make it so much healthier for you. When you bake please note that you have to watch them closely you have about 45 seconds from perfectly done until browned and over done. After making these for 4 or 5 days in a row I'm had to thow out 3 tray's because I didnt watch them closely. They should be crisp coming out and golden if the bend a little they are under done and they will not harden more upon standing. It covered 2 1/2 10 inch tortilla's. I served this with crab dip for this site and cut smaller triangles. I cant wait to make them again! These would be a great substitute for croutons on a salad. I now have a reason to keep tortilla's on hand. Terrific guilt free snack enjoyed by kids and grown up alike. Much better than tostitos.",

So this rating is based upon the flavor and not my choice of tortilla...Cooked them for 12 min and they came out golden brown looked great texture wasn't there.

To make a long story short i always end up substituting something for something that really shouldn't be in there. I was thrilled that i had all of the ingredients. One thing that I did wrong was that i cut the tortillas before brushing them it would have gone a lot faster if I had brushed first.These were crispy yummy and utterly amazing! When i popped them out of the oven the whole family came running to see what the spicy aromatic delicious smell wafting out of the kitchen was. Sure enough everyone loved it!",

I also ended up using 4 tortillas not 2 but I suppose I may have smaller tortillas than called for. I like the combo of flavors. I thought when making it that it calls for a lot of dill but since I like dill I didn't worry about it. A little different than purchased brands and takes a little time but delicious.
