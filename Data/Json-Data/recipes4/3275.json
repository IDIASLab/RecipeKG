Then I cooked them over medium heat till brown. I removed them from the pan and sauteed in butter the onion when the onion was translucent I added the squash and then the spinach and cooked them through. Then I added the meat back in and added the beef broth tomatoes red pepper flakes and a can of mushrooms. I also added 2 cans of great northern beans because that is what I had. Then I let it all simmer in the pot over low heat for about 40 minutes. I served with various cheeses and some crusty bread. Delicious! The whole family four year old included loved it!",

                "reviewBody": "This did take quite a bit of effort. I think it will be better when I try it again with a few changes. First of all, following the recipe produces a VERY spicy stew, so when you are adding the spices to the pork to sit overnight, next time I'd try using only 1 T of pepper, and a bit more salt (the pork was extremely peppery that it overpowered any other flavor). Also, if you don't like fat, make sure you TRIM the fat off the cubes of pork (I used a boneless pork shoulder roast and cut it up). I skipped the 3 hours in the oven thing and just put the pork in a crockpot (minus the spinach, which I don't see what its purpose is) on LOW for 3 hours (check to see if it's tender before adding the rest). Then put in olive oil/flour/onion, celery/mushroom mixture. Add the beef broth etc. like it says, and put it on HIGH for 3 more hours (I added the zucchini at this point as well, or it won't cook completely). Add the beans and spinach at the end (30 min on HIGH or 1 hr on LOW). \n\nI'd also consider having a separate dish for the kids to eat as this was pretty spicy. I cut back on the crushed red pepper flakes to about 1/4 t. and it was still extremely spicy. And watch that extra pepper you add at the end as it says. \n\nServe with fresh hot bread and it will be a complete meal. I'd make again, like I said, but with those changes.",
