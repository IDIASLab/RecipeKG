I also want to add that if you are having trouble with your wheat breads rising try adding in some Vital Wheat Gluten Flour, it's available in most grocery stores in the baking aisle.  In this recipe I replaced 1/4 cup of white flour with the wheat gluten and I got a lovely loaf of bread.  With using the Vital Wheat Gluten Flour I have success with even true 100% whole wheat breads.  I also prefer to bake my bread in my oven.  I use the dough cycle on bread machine and remove dough and knead a few times, maybe 10, on a floured board, shape and place in a greased bread pan.  Let rise, check every 10-15 minutes until desired height.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and loaf sounds hollow when tapped.  If you can resist ;)  let bread cool a bit before slicing or the loaf gets kinda squished.",

Only thing I did different was use melted butter because I am all out of oil. I used my Kitchen Aid from beginning to end. I warmed my maple syrup with the water to the right temp to proof with my yeast in my mixer bowl. After ten minutes I added the melted butter then all the dry ingredients. I had to add at least another 1/4 c. of flour but that's only because I think the weather was wetter. I kneaded with my bread hook for about five minutes or so then set in a large greased bowl covered with saran wrap and a towel on a warm oven to rise for an hour. After it had doubled I pounded it down and shaped into a loaf and set it to rise in an xl loaf pan for a half hour or so. I baked it at 350 for about 40 minutes. I don't usually time bread as I've gotten to know about when it smells ready. Very good bread. This one is going to be made regularly. I love how the flavor fools you a bit because even though you know it's maple.....you still think it might be something else. This would be a great base for cinnamon bread. NOTE: This is even better the next day warmed a bit slathered in butter and drizzled with real maple syrup. Pure heaven.",

The lack of salt in this recipe could be to blame for all the problems other reviewers have had with the bread being dense not rising or falling. I increased the salt to 1 tsp. I also reduced the liquid to 1 cup and used milk instead of water. When the beep sounded on my breadmaker I added chopped almonds. Delicious!!
