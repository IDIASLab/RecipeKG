I did add a bit of seasoning to the chicken before sauteeing it in the oil (adobo salt and pepper). Other than that the only changes I made were to reduce the amount of tomato sauce by half and thicken the sauce with a mixture of 1 Tbs butter and 1 Tbs flour at the end after removing the chicken. I served the sauce over the chicken and some steamed white rice. I'll definitely make this again and again. My 9-year-old daughter asked me to say she feels this is \"A Masterpiece\"!",

We added some roasted Anaheim chiles and used 1/2 tsp. ground cumin and 1/2 tsp. whole cumin. Not sure how much balsamic vinegar my guy put in. The sauce was much more flavorful 8 hours later after the spices had a chance to meld and assert themseves. We are going to use the rest of the chicken and sauce for enchiladas tonight. The flavors were not there in such a short cook time. Might try again.",
