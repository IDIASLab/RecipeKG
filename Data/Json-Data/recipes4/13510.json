It was perfect until I added it to the salad, and then it got lost.  I added at least another tablespoon of the white balsamic vinegar, and that seems to make a big difference.  Next time I'll start out with a third of a cup of vinegar and just a little less oil and go from there.  The directions for the rice and pasta were right on the mark.  I used dried cranberries rather than currants just because that's what I had, and my corn was fresh.  I used 1/4 cup of red onion, and I added a little more salt (I used kosher).  An addition of about 1/3 cup of toasted slivered almonds is perfect with the rice.  These are, for the most part, minor changes (though it sounds like more) for this gorgeous salad.  I will definitely make this again!  UPDATE:  I made this again and upped the vinegar to 1/3 cup, the Dijon to 1 tablespoon, and the salt and pepper a lot!  I added almost all the dressing to the warm rice and pasta for several hours before adding all the rest of the ingredients for the last several hours.  I owe SUCCESS to my friends on the Recipe Exchange, who graciously aided me in my efforts!  :)",

I did not have the wild rice on hand so I skipped it - but I will probably use it next time - as it adds to the colors! I will be making this dish again. The recipe calls for alot of vegetables diced into 3 tbsp. amounts. I woun't cut into 3 different peppers just for 1/4 of the pepper or open a can of corn just for 3 tbs. of corn - so of course I ended up with ALOT of this salad. I doubled the dressing but I omitted the 1/4 cup canola oil (it would be too greasy) - but added in just the 1/4 cup olive oil. I did not have white balsamic vinegar so I used regular balsamic.",

I agree with all who said the dressing was \"lost\" or it just needed more of the dressing it self. I doubled the dressing and was not at all sorry, I also added cranberries instead of currents, and BACON!!! The bacon was awesome. I crisped up about a half a pack of smoked bacon- chopped, and YUMmy! I added about a tablespoon of maple syrup as well to my second dose of dressing as I was out of honey from the first batch of dressing. I love this recipe, I made it for Thanksgiving only to get rave reviews and tons of people asking for the recipe, and I'm making it again due to requests for it at Chirstmas. Have fun and enjoy!!",
