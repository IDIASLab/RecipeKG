I realized I went back bite after bite and was pleasantly surprised I liked it. The recipe was fairly easy to follow. It took about an hour to set before I could add the mayo/mustard mixture. Then I was afraid that the vinegar wouldn't allow it to set up mixed the rest of the ingredients together and waited until the next day to check on it. It gelled quite nicely. To me the overall taste was like a coleslaw with chunks of ham and pineapple. I could see me putting a finer chop on both the celery and ham though. Into smaller pieces. Other then that I wouldn't change anything with the recipe. I think the mayo/mustard/vinegar mixture really sets this apart and makes the dish. It really was more savory then sweet and I WILL make again. TY",

I found it took longer than 30 min, maybe 40, to start to congeal and then when I went to mix the Mayo in there was chunks of gelatin... I used coleslaw mix instead of just cabbage. Flavor was interesting. I would describe it as a coleslaw jelly salad. I had cheese cubes on the side and if I was to make this again I would have ham on the side too. I used a Bundt pan for shape and it came out a tad watery... not sure what happened there. Would I make this again? No.",
