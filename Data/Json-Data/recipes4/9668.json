Thank you Jackie for such a great recipe. I made this soup again (a week later). Today I did everything as per the directions except I used a head of fresh cauliflower from the farmers vegetable stand. Once again \"souperb\". Did not have to add any seasonings or even salt. Thank you Jackie for a perfect creamy cheese based soup that I can do just about anything to without worry of ruining it.",
