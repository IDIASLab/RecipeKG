I also used drained \"trim\" cottage cheese in place of the ricotta only because a) it's cheaper and b) we like it better. Instead of parmesan on top I melted deli mozzerella cheese over the top. I made a homemade marinara to go with. Since I'm eating lower-carb I didn't eat mine on a bun I just spooned a tablespoon or so of marinara on my patty and covered it with spinach leaves. We liked this pretty well though doing the cheese in the middle of the burger was a pain and really seemed to serve no purpose. Maybe if it was to be mixed in to the actual burger?. I'll make this again but I'll add more spices and maybe work out the filling of the burger a little better. Very clever dinner idea. I think this would work as a \"sloppy joe\" if you were to just brown the meat add the spices and marinara and served them on broiled garlic butter buns that would be good too. NOTE: I did not grill my burgers it's too cold. This worked just fine cooking it on my broiler pan.",
