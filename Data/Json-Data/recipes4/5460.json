This is not a unique pasta salad, but it's a good one, and the submitter is correct - the bacon and cheddar DOES make it better.  In this case, I needed something at the last minute and this was good, filling and simple.  I find that often it's the basic recipes, the non-fussy, non-fancy recipes, that are the best.  I stuck pretty much to the submitter's intent, only adding a little sour cream as I always do to mayonnaise-based salads to mellow out the tang of the mayo, and some thawed, frozen peas.  This was exactly what I had in mind for our impromptu, grilled burgers dinner tonight.",
