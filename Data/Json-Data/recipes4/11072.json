I used the Blender hollandaise from AR using one extra egg yolk and subbing white balsamic vinegar for the lemon juice. I cooked the artichokes in boiling seasoned water cooled and then pulled off all the leaves to use as appetizers and then cleaned the bottom of the choke and this became a twofer recipe:) The artichokes could be done a day or two in advance to make this even easier to assemble. Love this!Thanks so much for sharing this terrific recipe Babs Hanna!",
