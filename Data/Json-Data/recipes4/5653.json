However I can't help tweak a recipe to my liking but the only true change I made with your recipe was to use 1/3 heaping cup fresh finely shredded parmesan. I know garlic powder and onion powder is easier but I took the extra effort for the fresh equivalents (3 tbsp plus 1 tsp minced garlic and 1 heaping tbsp fresh minced onion). I also made the entire five pounds and simply placed wax paper between the many extra uncooked patties placed them in a zip lock bag and froze them for future use;-)",

I cooked them in a skillet on medium-high heat for 6 minutes per side, since I don't have a grill.  Next time, I may add the bacon crumbled in the burger and let the mixture sit in the fridge for an hour to let the flavors soak in a bit.  Also, I may throw in some diced jalape\u00f1o for a little kick.  But, even without any changes, this recipe would be great!",

Just prior to grilling I made into patties. Had no problem with getting the burgers to stick together - they were just perfect. I did brush the rolls with olive oil and sprinkled them with garlic powder before toasting the rolls. Used mayo lettuce tomato shredded parmesan cheese sliced red onion. Served Sandwich Stuffers - Bread & Butter pickles and corn on the cob on the side. Thanks steveandjackie for sharing your recipe - a keeper for me!",
