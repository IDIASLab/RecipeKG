I am Italian so I doctored it up a bit used homemade sauce and added some things. I sauteed garlic onion and 2 zucchini in olive oil first while the spaghetti squash was cooking. Then I added the two squashes together and mixed the cheese mixture. I used a whole container of skim ricotta instead of cottage cheese (similar calories) with the parm and mozz. I added lots of italian herbs and two eggs to the cheese mixture. I don't like mine super saucey so I only topped with marinara and then with more parm and mozz. Baked 30 mins and was delish. My husband took the next two days to work for lunch and was pleased with it! And he LOVES pasta!",

Rather than use slices I made the squash in the traditional way raking the squash strands from a cooked spaghetti squash. My preferred method of cooking spaghetti squash is to cut it in half remove the seeds and bake cut side down for about 25 to 30 minutes at 375 degrees. I put half of the squash in the bottom of the pan added half the sauce and topped with the ricotta cheese mixture. Another layer of squash more sauce the Parmesan cheese and some additional mozzarella completed the lasagna. The addition of Italian sausage would be great. This vegetarian and gluten free meal will grace our table again!",

I've also found if I add a couple tablespoons of flour to whatever sauce I'm baking the squash with it really helps the watery factor. I added spinach to the cottage cheese layer and mushrooms tomatoes and bell pepper to the spaghetti sauce just because I had them and they needed to be used up. Amazing!",
