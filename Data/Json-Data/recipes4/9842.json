So I made another one (I think a failed recipie is a challenge and I keep trying to prove I can do it!) and this time let the filling cool before filling the crust and it turned out Perfect!  My husband loved it and the kids at least picked out the turkey, no vegatables for them!",

I used the onion and the celery but for the rest of the veggies I used half a bag of frozen corn, peas, carrots, and string beans.  I only used one boullion cube and 1 cup of water.  I cubed the potatoes pretty small and after the veggies and potatoes were cooked I added a jar of Homestyle turkey gravy.  I also used about 2 cups of cubed turkey.  I baked the bottom crust for 10 minutes while the filling was cooling and then covered with the top crust.  I sprayed the top crust with butter cooking spray to give it a little more color.  It came out perfect.  My husband ate almost half the pie.",

I followed another reviewers advice and used leftover stuffing as the top crust and it turned out beautifully.  I also used leftover turkey broth instead of the chicken boullion.  I was a little hesitant about the spices, but the flavor was good.  I may use a little less parsley next time just for looks and add a little poultry seasoning for a little extra \"turkey\" flavor.  One warning, though.  This makes a BIG pot pie.  The recipe calls for a 10 inch pie pan (which I don't have) so I used a medium casserole dish and it still filled to the brim and spilled over a little while cooking.  Just be sure to put some foil under the dish to catch spills!",

                "reviewBody": "First I want to say thank you to the original poster and that I loved the flavor of this recipe so much I wanted to make it again but with a few important changes.  As stated by some others, this pot pie has no sauce to it and that\u2019s a must for me. So I exchanged milk for cream and doubled the quantity to 1 cup.  There is no measurement for potato in the recipe, and it needs it. The first time I used 3 small russets and it was far too much so I changed that to 1.5 cup cubed potato.  I used turkey stock from the boiled turkey carcass and it made a noticeable improvement.  I increased the amount of turkey from 1.5 cups to 2.5 cups and slightly increased the amount of flour to 4 Tbs. I also used torn pieces of turkey instead of cubed but that\u2019s just a personal preference and shouldn\u2019t affect the flavor.   With these modifications the result was a perfect pot pie with a creamy sauce and great flavor. You may wish to slightly increase the seasoning to compensate for the additional turkey.  Pre-baking the bottom crust for 5-6 minutes is a must as the filling is now more liquid.",

Definitely add the soup - it makes this recipe perfect and earns it that 5th star.  I also used the flaky butter crust, it was a perfect compliment and had the best flavor of any crust I've ever made.",

                "reviewBody": "This was great.  I had a 14-pounder in my freezer and it was time to cook it.  After deboning, it yielded 10 cups of juicy turkey.  I tripled this recipe (for freezing) and used 3+ cups of turkey in each.  Oherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was perfect.  The only thing I would try for a change is to add a packet of turkey gravy and an additional cup of water to the pie filling (per pie).  I like the taste of turkey gravy and I like it to taste like turkey, not chicken.  If you're going to make turkey pot pie, this is the one to try.  Thanks.",
