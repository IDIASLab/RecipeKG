                "reviewBody": "Hi everyone, this is my recipe, and I wanted to say thanks for the generally positive reviews and to offer an explanation for the issue of saltiness. First off, this recipe is designed to be on the salty side, but certainly not to the degree of being offensive. As kosher salt is called for remember kosher salt contains less salt per teaspoon, and different brands of salt vary further. I also made a mistake in writing out the recipe, because while I measure the 1 Tbsp salt in the dough, I just sprinkle some on top without measuring it. When I typed up the recipe I think I put something like \"1/2 - 1 Tbsp,\" but Allrecipes doesn't like varied ammounts so they chose the upper limit when they edited this recipe. Just use what you want on top, but I do recommend the 1 Tbsp kosher in the dough. As a note, they edited the recipe quite a lot.  I think the entire \"directions\" section is unrecognizable as something I would write, and the ingredients have mostly just been standardized (like saying 1/2 c. onion, rather than 1 small onion) and defined (like saying 3 Tbsp olive oil instead of \"some more olive oil\"). I appologize if the one hour claim is a bit optimistic. It can be done if you have particularly happy yeast or are in a hurry, but I realize often it takes longer. Obviously everyone has figured out the possibilities of inclusions, and I will let you in on one of my all time favorites: kalamata olives. I still make this all the time, but often just onionless dough for pizza.",

I did as the recipe states and added 1 tablespoon of salt sprinkled ontop, along with olive oil and parmesan cheese.This totally ruined the bread because it was way too salty! Other than that, it is a good recipe. Very easy. I omitted the onion and used garlic powder. I baked it on parchment paper instead of an oiled sheet, much easier clean up that way. I will try this again, but will use 1 teaspoon of salt ontop next time. UPDATE-- I made this again and used about 1 tsp of salt in the topping instead of 1 Tbls. Much better! I will be making this quite often!",
