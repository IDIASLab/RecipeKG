North Indian Korma is pale yellow in color from saffron and cooked without any tomatoes or turmeric. This recipe version will be the closest to the traditional Kashmiri Korma. Kashmir Pandits substitute onion and garlic with asafoetida. Serve with jasmine rice and mango chutney.",

From the start I wondered about the amounts listed. 2 pounds of meat but only 1/3 cup of beans? I ended up changing a lot of things...to even out my ingredients. I also thought the liquid/sauce wasn't the right flavor exactly. And that could be all my fault based on the type of curry powder I used. It lists a few of the spices in it but not all. Maybe it didn't have enough of some flavors or too much of others for this particular dish. (I make my own sometimes...but had a prepared powder on hand and wanted to use it up). I made a few changes in the amount of liquid (less water more coconut milk) added sour cream (there was no yogurt in this dish which I was okay with at first but decided it needed it after tasting...and I didn't have any plain)...a little salt garlic. Maybe if I'd waited until the end it would have been a beautiful dish...but I couldn't risk it! So I didn't mark this 1 star but didn't want it to have a 5 star either. It's not a terrible starting point for a curry dish...but I can't say it resembled any korma I've tried/made before.",
