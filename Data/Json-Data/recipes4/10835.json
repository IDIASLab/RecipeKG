The only changes I made were to use bottled peppers like someone else mentioned in the reviews; eliminated the olives (just because I don't like them); and used Thai long grain rice (since I have a gigantic bag of the stuff). I don't like super hot meals but this dish was a flavourful heat. I found myself adding a bit more jalapenos each time! Don't make the mistake I did at first though -- I drained the black beans. It was still good but it is oh so delicious on rice with more sauce! I make a pile of this stuff and dole it out as a snack sidedish or main meal with salad. I also did what someone else suggested: sautee some onions and garlic and add it to the beans -- YUM!! Thanks for a quick recipe with minimum dishes to clean up afterwards!",
