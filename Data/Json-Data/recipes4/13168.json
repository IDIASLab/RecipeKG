My local store did not have bulk chorizo, so I used a 1 lb. package of chorizo links, removed the casings, browned and sliced 'em.  I may actually use 1.5 lbs. next time, just to have a little more meat.  I also used chicken broth instead of water, which made the stew almost too salty, so reduced sodium broth is probably the way to go.  My BF was a little turned off by the lentils, so I may even try a different bean next time, just to change it up a little (an 8 or 16 bean blend would probably be nice).  All in all, a fantastic recipe that will definitely be at the top of my soup list.  UPDATE: I made this again, doubled the chorizo, and used a 13 bean blend in place of just lentils.  Love it, love it, love it!",

The only change I made to the recipe was substituting a can of chicken broth for some water (I still used 3 cups of liquid) and it came out more like a thick sauce you would eat over rice than something eaten from a bowl. In fact with the exception of the chorizo this had very strong Indian flavors. It was tasty enough that I'll make it again; the only reason for four stars instead of five is that the \"stew\" implies it's a meal in itself whereas it really needs a little something to go with it. Next time I'll serve it over Basmati rice.",
