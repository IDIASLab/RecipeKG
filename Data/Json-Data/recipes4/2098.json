It is very easy to assemble & it bakes nicely - crispy on top & lightly browned. My casserole was brown and crunchy on the bottom too - maybe could have baked it a little less. I would not make this recipe again since I prefer crisper vegetables and less breading. Perhaps reduce the amount of bread crumbs and toss in some fresh beans or use kitchen sliced canned beans instead of french cut - they may hold up better instead of disappearing into the cheese & bread crumbs when baked.",
