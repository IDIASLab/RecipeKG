I usually always follow a \"new-to-me\" recipe exactly as written the first time, then tweak to my liking if necessary. But, this time, I thought I knew better and added freshly grated ginger because I also love ginger. It was very good, but the fresh ginger overpowered the carrot flavor. And, afterall, this IS carrot soup. The second time I made it, I used powdered ginger as the recipe called for. Still delicious, and the the carrot flavor was much more pronounced. I will make this again and again following the recipe to the letter, but I think I will roast some (bite sized) carrots in the oven to add at the last minute. My DH needs something to chew. A wonderfully satisfying comfort soup. I LOVE this stuff!",

I also left out the celery because I didn't have any on hand - but feel like it didn't need it. Yum!!",

I suppose experimenting with the spices might improve the flavor but with so many great soup recipes on this site I'll probably just file this under not repeatable. Inexpensive and easy though so if you like mildly flavored try this.",
