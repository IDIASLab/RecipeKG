You can even substitute your favorite taco seasoning for the seasonings in the recipe to avoid it being too spicy.

I could not find tri tip so I used another less expensive cut of beef. I suspect you could use most any beef. There was way too much liquid for tacos so about an hour before people showed up I drained off most on the liquid into a sauce pot of and reduced in on the stove top. When it had cooked down to a pretty think mix I returned it to the beef and let it all cook on. The sauce is wonderful and it seems a shame not to concentrate the flavors. This was great for a casual party.",
