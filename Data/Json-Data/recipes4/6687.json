I sprinkle the stuffing mix over the top and drizzle butter over the stuffing before baking. This is also great for after Thanksgiving--just use leftover turkey, whatever vegetables you have left over, leftover gravy and you can even add a layer of mashed potatoes. VERY filling. This is one of my husband's favorite meals.",

With the cooler temps approaching, this will be a staple. This is awesome comfort food...a definite keeper~YUM Thanks for sharing. :)",

I have to double the recipe AND hide some of it if I want leftovers for lunch the next day (add enough gravy to moisten, form into patties and fry.  Yum!)  I've done this with no veggies, with broccoli, with peppers and sun dried tomato, and with leftover grilled veggies (squash, zucchini, onion, cherry tomato, bell pepper).  It's all good.  Like another reviewer, I sometimes substitute cream of chicken soup + broth if I don't have gravy close at hand.  Be generous with the pepper/seasoning (I like garlic and onion powder), but ease off on salt; it can get too salty if the soup/gravy isn't reduced sodium.",
