I have made this seveal times now, but I use canned corn and tomatoes and it tastes great! I use one can if diced tomatoes, and one can of Mexican tomatoes and chilis (instead of the jalapeno). I serve it with cheese quesadillas. Yum! It's kinda like the Tex-Mex version of tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches. I garnish with sour cream and chopped red onion. The first time I made this I thought the step where you puree half of it was strange, but it really adds to the texture. Don't skip this step if you can! I have actually done that to some other dishes since then, it's a good trick. Really beefs it up. This is a wholesome, hearty meal, a good change from the tradional chili.",

I also used 1 red bell pepper eliminated the jalapeno pepper chopped the mushrooms into small chunks because they were large used frozen corn niblets and only used 1/2 tsp. of cumin. I didn't bother pureeing some of the chili either. It was tasty as chili especially with some shredded cheddar as a topping. Another time though when I reheated it I added an extra cup of chicken broth to the leftovers as well as some cooked brown rice. I think I actually preferred it this way as a yummy black bean soup. Of course when adding more liquid you can adjust the seasoning to your taste.",

I chose to make it without meat because of its high cost here. Of course, because I had never made chili before, I turned to this site. We all agreed that it turned out quite well. I changed but a few things based on availability and cost differences here (no jalapeno or broth, used canned tomatoes and corn, substituted one can black beans with red salad beans, added zucchini, garlic and carrots), and it turned out great. It was perhaps a bit too spicy for the average person, but I liked it just fine, and my international friends were impressed. I think it is not quite 8 servings though. I fed 5 other people and had just a small bowl leftover.",
