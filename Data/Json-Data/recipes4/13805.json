I'm really giving 5 stars to the pancake portion of the recipe but look forward to trying the filling as written... soon. This is a great starting point for a quick inexpensive and healthy meal. Really quite good flavor out of the \"pancake\" part of the dish. We actually filled them with black beans corn and a little Cabot cheddar cheese. I can see switching up the ingredients to create new masterpieces. I'm wondering what's the importance of instant oatmeal as old fashioned oats seemed to work just fine. We liked these so much I'll try another variation tomorrow. Thanks Linda!!",

It's easy to just throw all of the ingredients in the blender and make the batter.. then while those are cooking find whatever you have in the fridge (I used red bell pepper mushroom crushed garlic cream cheese sliced deli ham sliced yellow onion) to make the filling. The cream cheese really added a nice creamy texture and made it kind of saucy. If I had some cream and Parmesan I probably would have used that.. but it was yumm!!!",

Then I added the cottage cheese to smooth out the curds. I couldn't see dirtying another appliance so I added my 2 whole eggs and spices and about 2 tbs of water and whirled away for about 30 seconds. My filling was asparagus mushrooms a handful of diced onion and 1 clove minced garlic sauteed in 1 tbs EVOO When cooked I turned off the heat added 1/2 cup grated Jarlsburg and covered the pan while I made the pancakes. What a great Lenten dinner with a salad. Thanks Linda!",
