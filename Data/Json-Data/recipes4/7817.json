I used a red bell pepper from my garden (1st one picked) and added some sliced red onions and garlic to the mushroom mixture. I love how you can really make this sandwich your own..i used BBQ sauce in place of mayo and Monterey Jack cheese because that's what i had on hand. Thanks for the Delicious recipe..will be making this again!",
