One can of tomatoes is hardly worth the effort - increase it to two.  I mix about 1 cup of light sour cream and about 1/4 cup of milk in with the soup.  Don't layer with the cheese.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake about 45 minutes.  Then, top with shredded cheese (I'm not sure what the point of a 1/4 cup of cheese is....increase it to your liking), remove foil and cook ~10 more minutes.",

It tasted ok, but was dry. The second time I used 1/2 onion, plain diced tomatoes (not stewed), substituted mozzarella for the cheddar, used 1/2 package of noodles and cooked for about 20 minutes and it was very good.",

I just took it out of the oven and had to try a little bit since it smelled so good when it was baking. The cheese made this glorious crust over the noodles and that alone was enough to make me give this a five-star review. The combination of cream of chicken soup canned tomatoes and ground beef sounded bizarre but it is really complimentary. I used bow-tie pasta and greased the bottom of my baking dish with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray. The noodles came out without any problems and I'm thoroughly enjoying my tiny helping of this great casseole. Thank you for sharing Karen! I'll be sure to make this again.",

I noticed some comments stated the noodles were crunchy...Tip:make sure all noodles are covered with sauce. This is a definite keeper.",
