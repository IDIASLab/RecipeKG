Please disregard all cooking times listed!!! If you actually cooked the onions for 20 minutes they would be little bits of carbon! cook the meatballs sausage and pork until they are good and crusty the onions until they nicely browned and the whole thing until it tastes good. The longer it simmers the more flavor the meat will impart to the sauce. But please bear in mind that if it simmers too long the meat WILL fall apart. Especiall the meatballs. It is also a good idea to remove the meat after the sauce is done as the acids from the tomatoes will also cause the meatballs to disintegrate if left long enough. I learned this the hard way! My Grandma failed to mention that part!",

I followed the recipe almost to the tee but did add garlic to the meatballs and a little to the sauce itself. Here's a hint for the meatballs: rub olive oil over your hands while you're rolling them. They stay so much nicer when you're cooking them and don't come apart this way. This was a wonderful recipe!",

I only used the meatball recipe part and followed it to the letter (with the exception of not having Romano so I used fresh grated Parmesan cheese AND I used panko bread crumbs) and they turned out amazing. I rolled them in small 1\" sized balls. Make sure you follow the instructions written when cooking. Let them fry in the oil long enough to release themself from the bottom of the skillet. They will tell you when it's time to be turned. I found that a few needed some gentle nudging but for the most part all released themselves on their own and you just stir them around from there. Excellent meatballs...thank you for sharing this recipe.",

The meatballs are fairly good but would be so much better with some fresh minced garlic. I attempted to make the entire recipe but when I got to the part where I was to cook the onions the oil didn't look appetizing. Since I had already browned all of the meat I decided to quickly saute chopped onion and garlic and proceed from there. I think that the entire recipe would benefit from basil oregano red pepper flakes and a splash of red wine.",
