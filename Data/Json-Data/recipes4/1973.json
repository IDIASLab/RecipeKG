First, instead of boiling your chicken cook it in a little lemon juice with onion, green onion and a few extra spices-chili powder, garlic, salt, pepper, and paprike. Then, when your filling your tortillas use about a spoonfull of suace to each one. The las palmas sauce is just about the best thing, next to making your own suace. Serve with sour cream on top and your set to go!",

I did cook 3 medium chicken breast, and I'm sure it was more than one pound, in a pressure cooker with cumin, garlic, pepper, and paprika and diced some onions. Hint: used the broth for Mexican rice. Then I shredded the chicken and added a large can of diced green chilies to it. I filled 10 flour tortillas with the chicken and cheese, which fit into a 9X13 pan perfectly. Used the Las Palmas canned green sauce over the top, also added more shredded cheese, slices of pickled jalape\u00f1os and black olives to the top. They cooked for 30 min. and I let them sit for about ten before cutting them. These enchiladas were so tasty, you just kept wanting to eat them even though you were stuffed. And they didn't even need any sour cream. So much healthier. Thanks Shackl",

In the Mexican culture we don't typically make enchiladas with flour tortillas so I stuck to the usual corn tortillas.  I dipped each tortilla in hot oil for about 20 seconds each and drained them and then dipped them in the Las Palmas Green Chile Sauce (large can).  I then added chopped, cooked chicken (I boiled the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, salt and pepper), adding pepper jack cheese and a heaping tablespoon of green chile sauce into each tortilla, roll it up and when all are done pour the remaining sauce over the top, and finish just as the recipe asks.  When they were done cooking I sprinkled, from a small can, chopped green chiles and chopped green onions.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Very good recipe but with a little tweaking it comes out perfect.",
