It made my eggplant mush so I couldn't include it. I instead diced a raw yellow squash I had on hand and tossed it in the oven with the other ingredients for the recommended time. This worked out really well. My onion was nice and mild so even though it retained some crunch its flavor wasn't too strong. Quinoa is one of my favorite grains (worth a try if you've never had it!) and it went really well with the other fresh ingredients. This is a great one for dinner after a summer trip to the farmer's market.",
