I almost left the ginger out, because I'm not a big fan of ground ginger, but I'm glad I left it in. Very simple to prepare, but full of flavor.  My roast was about 2.5lbs, and even though it was smaller than stated in the ingredients, I still cooked it the full 4 hours. It was perfectly juicy and tender. Next time I will leave out the honey since I prefer my meat not to have any sweetness to it. I served this with \"creamy mashed sweet potatoes\" and \"apple-pear sauce\" which can be found on this site. Thank you wally_C for sharing your recipe! I look forward to having leftovers for lunch this week.",
