One thing I did learn is that you really don't need to measure the batter into the skillet. All you really need to do is pour it into the bottom of a medium/large skillet until it almost reaches the sides. Make sure it is starting to get golden and fairly solid before you flip. If not they will stick together on the plate you are stacking them up on and they will not be able to be used. Again I am a rookie with crepe and learned more as I went. What I didn't like about the recipe was the amount of ginger. I highly recommend scaling way back on it. With that being said I think this was a great recipe!",
