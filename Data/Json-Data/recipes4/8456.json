First tip: use sliced pepperoncini instead of whole pepperoncini if you can find it - saves the step of de-stemming, and the sliced peppers are perfect with the final product whereas the whole ones are a bit large.  Second tip:  I recommend using at least 1/4 cup of butter.  I made this once with 1/2 cup (which is what the original recipe this one is derived from calls for), and once with about 1/8 cup.  The former made the leftovers seems a bit greasy, and the latter made the roast turn out kind of dry.  1/4  to 1/2 cup is perfect, and here is the trick at the end to reduce the greasiness:  Remove the meat from the slow cooker.  Pour the juices into a large measuring cup.  Allow the fat to separate to the top for a couple minutes.  Skim the fat from the top and discard (except place 2-4 tablespoons into sauce pan for making a gravy).  Add 2 Tbsp flour to the reserved 2-4 Tbsp fat and whisk together over medium heat to make a roux.  Add the juices (from which you just skimmed the fat - I've found there is usually about two cups of juices left) to the roux and cook for a couple minutes to reduce - viola, the perfect gravy.",

I always use 1/2 jar of sliced pepperoncini peppers versus whole - these are key, don't leave them out even if you think you don't like them like I did. My version has the mixes sprinkled on top of meat, doused with peppers & topped with a stick (yes!) of butter. No gravy from this, it's more of a slab of meat dish lol. Try it, you won't be sorry!",

I serve mine over rice and I find that there is not a whole lot of gravy made.  to rectify that I pour some of the pepperoncini juice into slow cooker and also add 1 cup of beef broth.

It came out great and was delicious. Even my picky eater 9-year-old raved. \n\nThe second night, I purchased long French rolls from our local French bakery, and served the shreded beef on the rolls with carmelized onions, saut\u00e9ed porcini mushrooms, horseradish and the au jus for dipping along side some homemade sweet potato fries with sea salt and rosemary. It was FABULOUS. \n\nTo make shredding a beeeze, I toss the roast into the bowl of my Kitchen Aide stand mixer with the paddle attachment and put it on the lowest setting until it's shredded. This also works great for shredding pork roasts or carnitas and also boneless cooked chicken for making chicken salad or chicken enchiladas. \n\nI'm not worried about the butter, fat or sodium.
