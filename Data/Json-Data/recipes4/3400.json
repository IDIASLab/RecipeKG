                "reviewBody": "Thanks for the recipe Keka.  I have to say I did enjoy the way all the flavors married together; however, next time I will make a feel changes.  First, instead of slicing the onions I would opt for diced.  Just my own preference but if you have picky kids sliced may be the way to go so as to pick them out. Also, for me 2 onions was way too much and I even doubled the recipe.  Next time I will use half and onion or a whole onion if I double the recipe again.  As for the soy sauce I found that 2tbsp suited my taste more which after doubling the entire recipe came to 4tbsp.  Although, I have to note that I didn't add any extra salt or pepper.  Last change I made was to leave out the cilantro.  I am sure it would have been just as good with since I do love cilantro.  Only thing is I am the only one who likes it in the family so just as well to leave it out.  All in all this was a good twist on shrimp fried rice and I will make again.",

Also in case you don't catch it step #1 should be \"Pour in the eggs \" not \"Pour in the onions \" Followed the recipe to the letter except using cashews instead of walnuts (sorry I just couldn't see walnuts in this dish). Made a lot this is 2 VERY generous servings (in this house would be 3). This was O.K. but it's doubtful I'll make again.",
