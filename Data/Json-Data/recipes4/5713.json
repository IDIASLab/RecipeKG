Local grocery store didn't have beef rump on sale but did have beef stew meat on sale and that's what I used. I did have to cook it a couple extra hours on high to have tender meat but that's because I used a different meat... Thanks HFDmedic we all really liked... nothing but Yummy from all 7! I did use Jasmine rice with 6 tablespoons of butter (we doubled the recipe and had plenty of broth)and some Herb Ox poultry seasoning (powder) which is the best! Other than that I followed the recipe. Thank you!",

In short it was bland and needed a lot more seasoning. I'm not entirely sure what I would add but definitely a lot more onion some garlic maybe some Worcestershire sauce. We're cooking a solid 2lb slab of beef - not much of that flavor gets to the interior even with the extra hour after the roast is cut up. I took the leftover meat and braised it low and slow for about 3 hours in a broth including onion powder garlic powder some soy sauce a little sugar... much more tender and flavorful. I would also recommend using corn starch instead of bothering with making a roux. Much much easier.",
