I added 1/2 cup of sliced carrots to sauteed veggie mixture. I substituted the cream of mushroom soup for cream of potato because we do not like mushrooms; added 1 pint of half & half (and added only enough water to make desired consistency instead of using 3 1/2 cups of water) 1/4 cup roasted sliced almonds and 1/4 cup cubed Velveeta cheese to simmering soup. It turned out nice and creamy. Two lbs of bacon may have been a touch too much so next time I will only use 1 lb. A definite comfort food and I will make this soup again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!",
