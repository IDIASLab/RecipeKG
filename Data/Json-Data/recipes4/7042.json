I was out of a couple things so I did use Diced Tomatoes with Basil & Garlic, and used packaged Taco Seasoning instead of the Italian Seasoning.  This was almost to simple to be so good!  The chicken flavor was heavenly, moist & juicy. The leftovers made wonderful sandwiches.   I will be using this recipe a lot - probably again this week!",

We only had two chicken breasts, so I just went with it.  I used 3-4 cloves of garlic, 1/2 an onion (which I placed in the bottom of the slow cooker under the chicken) and a Tbsp. of Italian seasoning.  I also added 1.5 Tbsp. of aged balsamic vinegar which added a lot of depth of flavor.  Because there were only two chicken breasts, I opted for cooking for six hours.  This was too long a time for the amount of chicken we had and it came out a little dry.  I'll still be making it again as the sauce came out really well.  This recipe almost seems like it would be a good basis for Chicken Cacciatore, but I'll have to play with it some more.  Looking forward to making this again!",

I will admit it turned out tasting a bit on the \"rich\" side but it sure was good! Sent in my husbands lunch the next day and he said he couldn't wait for lunchtime. Re-heats very well.
