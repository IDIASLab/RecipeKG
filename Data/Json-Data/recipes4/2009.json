I used regular orange juice from concentrate vs. fresh squeezed then added a bit of fresh and added a bit of orange zest (did the same for the lime).  I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate all day.  I highly recommend adding the Tabasco as it gives it a nice kick.  The chicken came out moist, tender and the cilantro paired nicely with the citrus.  I served this with \"Lime Cilantro Rice\" from this site and the leftover chicken went great over mixed greens with \"Orange Citrus Vinaigrette\" from this site.",

Let meat marinade for at least 6 hrs in the refrigerator (preferably overnight)  and I guarantee, you will absolutely love it!",
