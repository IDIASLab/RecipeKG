I made this almost exactly the same as the recipe--I used 1 enormous yellow bell pepper (when chopped it was like 2 normal-sized peppers) and also added broccoli to the pot. I also added a smidge more crushed red pepper since we like spicy food and I found out later my husband snuck in another spoonful of peanut butter while it was cooking. The flavors were great--sweet and spicy and a little smokey somehow all at once. Adding broccoli is a must in my opinion as it sucks up the sauce and just explodes with flavor in your mouth. I put in the veggies in the beginning as the recipe states and thought they held up pretty well--no crunch of course but they didn't cook into mush they were just really soft which was nice. Served over brown rice and may add carrots or some more peppers next time for more veggies as we definitely had plenty of sauce to go around. Definitely a keeper for us!",

Cut boneless chops into strips and don't add the bell peppers until the last half-hour of cooking or they will disintegrate. I also cut the ginger in half...way too much for only 1 lb. of meat and although I LOVE garlic some of my cloves were pretty big so I only used 4 which I thought gave it plenty of garlic flavor. Sprinkled some fresh chopped cilantro on top & a squeeze of fresh lime too. Enjoy with an ice cold beer!:-)",
