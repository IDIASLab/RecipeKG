I only made two and used an 8 x 8 dish to hold the ramekins.  I think I needed 3  1/2 cups of hot water.  I sprayed the ramekins and 20 minutes baking produced my ideal eggs, the whites were just done, the yolk had started to film over and was still runny.  The pasta sauce had thickened a little which was good too.  Not sure if mine were compliant served over orzo but they were delicious.  Thanks!",

I love that you can stick these in the oven, and not worry about them while you prepare other foods. The only suggestion I have is to spray the inside of the ramekins with cooking spray as the sides of the egg tends to stick. Thanks for the great recipe SheLovesPaleo!",

Yolks soft but not runny. Might try 12 minutes next time.  I did coat the ramekins with spray for easy clean up. Already have a request for repeat tomorrow morning!!
