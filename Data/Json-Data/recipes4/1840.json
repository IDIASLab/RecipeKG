I agree that the chicken should be baked and then broiled to be crispy on the outside (if that is what you like).  I agree about sliced cheese versus shredded.  I agree that roast red peppers add a great flavor.  Next time I will experiment by adding some spinach or asparagus which may add to the elegance of this dish.\n7/17/07 I did add the asparagus to the chicken for a dinner party and it was delicious.  It was so pretty to see the red, white and green inside the chicken.  I think it needs a sauce over the top though.  I will continue to perfect this recipe.",

I seasoned the breasts with salt and pepper and didn't bother mixing the seasonings Parmesan and chives just sprinkled them on the chicken one by one. Just a matter of personal taste I guess but the only thing I didn't like about this was the dried Italian seasoning which I found unpleasantly harsh. I would have much preferred fresh even if it meant choosing only one herb to save on cost--fresh basil for instance would be wonderful! Loved the addition of the roasted red pepper. I made this easy on myself by baking this at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes which browned the chicken beautifully. I served this with fresh asparagus and \"Elegant Orzo with Wilted Spinach and Pine Nuts \" also from this site.",
