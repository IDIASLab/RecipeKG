Just a couple of things: For the onions and pepers, you can use a mixture of orange and lime juice so it is not so sour. It is not necessary to cook the meat in oil, as a matter of fact you shouldn't as the original thing is not done like this. Originally it is marinated for a good couple of hours or overnight with the achiote sauce and then baked in a ground type of oven....modern homes just use the normal oven, slow cooker or pressure cooker (up to you). You can skip the use of guajillo, but is also nice with it, and yes it has liquid after you cooked it, that is NORMAL. The correct amount of salt is the key for all the ingredients to come together. This is not a spicy dish, the spice comes from the habaneros, but that should be added individually at the dinner table. Remember that Mexican food is very complex and what is prepared in the south is completely different form the northern  part of the country.  This is a southern dish. Hope you enjoy it!",

So - I basically rubbed and seared the pork mixed the vinegar OJ and garlic and popped it in the slow cooker all afternoon. What came out was awesome. I pulled the pork and drizzled the juice on it and had it on sandwich buns - it was like a citrus-y vinegar-style pulled pork. The picky kid scarfed it down excitedly.",

I also took the advice of another poster and added 1/3 can OJ concentrate to the liquid and another 1/3 can to the juice of 5 limes (not 10 limes)in the salsa. I chopped the onions slices and added cilantro to the salsa and it was GREAT. I can see using this citrus onion sauce on other dishes it was really tasty. I served this piled on thick cheese arepas (thick central-american corn tortillas/pancakes)and we ate with a knife and fork. Next time--I don't really like the taste of achiote paste that much so I think next time I will halve that to 3.5 oz it was just too strong. Thank you for posting this recipe!!",
