When I make this with cumin, I like to also add oregano, coriander and some chili powder and throw in some sauteed red pepper when I puree the soup. Another way I make this soup is to roast my cauliflower with thyme, puree it with chicken stock and add sauteed onion and minced garlic and a touch of extra sharp white cheddar cheese. GREAT low-carb faux-potato soup and great for those on a tight budget but need something warming/filling for take-in lunch. This both re-warms and freezes well.",

Perhaps my Magic Bullet pulverized the soup too much but I would prefer it chunkier and thicker. I added some chopped red onions near the end of the cooking with the broth and added shredded cheddar cheese on top when serving. There will be a next time!!! I think I will thicken it with a slightly thickened white sauce. Yeah I know more calories but we just like thicker soups.",
