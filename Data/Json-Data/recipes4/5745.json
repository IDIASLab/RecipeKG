I excluded the avocado and corn altogether and replaced the mango with pineapple. Additionally, I added fresh, chopped tomatoes and scallions. I cooked the pineapple with the quinoa to provide some sweetness to balance the spice. I added the tomatoes, scallions, cilantro, and lime juice at the end after the quinoa was done cooking but still hot in the skillet. The last modification involved replacing the fresh jalapeno with an extremely spicy sauce called Sun in a Bottle - I'm not sure if you can find it in the States.",
