First I made two pizzas (one without frying the tortilla and one with the fried tortilla) just to compare both. I topped them with seasoned tomato sauce cheese and spinach. I preferred the fried tortilla because it made a crispier crust. The other tasted too much like a regular warmed-up burrito. I was able to get quite creative with toppings using the tasty leftovers (sauce & chicken) from the Slow Cooker Chipotle Chicken recipe on this site. I just spread some of the leftover chipotle sauce over the fried tortilla topped it with cheese shredded chicken more cheese and baked it for 7 minutes. One of the best little pizzas I've ever made! P.S. I did not use 2 cups of oil to fry my tortillas as 1 cup of oil was enough to completely cover the bottom of my frying pan and fry them evenly.",
