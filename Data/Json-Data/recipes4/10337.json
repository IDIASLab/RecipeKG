After putting on greased baking sheet; bake for 20-25 mins. at 400(golden brown) then cut a 1-inch long slit on side of each eclair. Reduce oven temp to 375 and bake for 10 more mins (this allows the inside to cook a little).Hope this helps. Try filling with BAVARIAN CREME FILLING: 1 1/2 C. chilled whipped cream; 1 pkg. (8 oz) cream cheese softened; 2/3 C. brown sugar; 1 t. vanilla; 1/8 t. salt...In a chilled bowl beat cream untill stiff. Blend remaining ingredients & fold in cream.",

Way too much butter for such a dinky amount of flour. First off the amount would have made maybe 6 tiny tiny shells which are bit sized! Second the dough never becomes shell like but stays doughy and soft. Very gross to look at and tasted like oily un-cooked dough. Horrible recipe! And a waste of ingredients!",

I wound up with 12 eclairs and enough filling for 12 more. I did give this two stars because at least they are edible. I'm an experienced baker but can't imagine what went wrong.
