The resulting tea follows in the tradition sprung up on the west coast, particularly the SF bay area, where a fondness for strong spices seems to be most favored, savored and brewed. Add enough soy milk or cows milk to suit your taste.",

The blend of spices was poorly balanced. The taste of licorice root & fennel was much too much. It was missing cardamom pods and ginger. As well the brewing time was much too long for spices alone.",

I sweeten with honey and do use soy milk. A sneaky way of adding protein to my favorite daytime drink.",
