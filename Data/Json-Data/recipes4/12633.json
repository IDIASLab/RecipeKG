I cooked it on the stove for 45 minutes instead of using the crock pot.  I was hungry.",

It was eatable, but next time I am limiting cooking time to 3 to 4 hours on low. Fully cooked ham, veggies and lentils don't need half a day to cook.

I bought a small turkey ham and chopped it up to add to the mix. I grew up always adding vinegar to my soup bowl, so I threw that in too. Man was this ever good on this very cold N.J. March evening.
