We didn't measure the BBQ sauce . . . just squirted some on from the bottle.  I think that next time I will add a little extra seasoning (maybe garlic powder, or a little Kickin'chicken).  I'm going to look for a larger can of beans, too, because my daughter seemed to enjoy those the most.  \n\nIt wasn't a fancy meal, but it was easy enough for my little beginner to help out, and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I don't normally fix drumsticks, and I think next time I might try thighs or breasts, for meatier portions.  \n\nThanks for the recipe!",
