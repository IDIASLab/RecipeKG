I used a little less bacon (5 slices for a double recipe) because I had thick sliced bacon.  Also, I added chopped hard boiled eggs, because that other pea salad had them in it.  Wonderful.  Using frozen or fresh peas is a key in, as canned peas (much like green beans) don't even taste the same in my opinion, and the mushy texture and bland color are a turn off.  To the poster that said it got watery the next day, that's normal... just stir it with a spoon for gosh sakes, or tilt it and drain off the water.",

This was a huge hit and is now a staple in our menu plans. I used a couple of shortcuts--I don't boil the peas. Just put them in a colander and run hot water over them until they thaw. I also use a package of real bacon bits instead of cooking the bacon. I have used both regular frozen peas and the \nGreen Giant Select baby sweet peas--the baby peas are sweeter and make it even better! This also better if you refrigerate it overnight.",
