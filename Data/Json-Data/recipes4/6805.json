Despite our friendship like GW I cannot tell a lie so rest assured the review is legit (in fact I stumbled upon the recipe in the newest recipes and didn't even realize it was hers until I was about to make it!). I wasn't sure what to expect with this but we loved it! It was like spaghetti and meatballs and garlic bread all in the same easy to eat dish. I had everything in the freezer (Jay's pizza crust dough Meatball Nirvana and homemade sauce) so all I had to do was thaw that stuff boil noodles and assemble. Pretty easy. To help you from making the same mistakes I did please note the submitter tells you to flour your work space. This is key to avoid rippage. It's helpful to rinse the pasta in cold water (or use cold leftovers) to avoid warming the dough/rippage too. The measurements are spot on though I did add some raw diced onion and fresh mozz simply because they needed to be used. I'm a lousy roller (and had already made the aforementioned mistakes) so mine ended up being more stromboli like than rolled. We especially liked the garlic salt on top. I think this would be a great filling snack/meal for beer drinking and watching sports! THANKS Sanzoe for another winner!",

I read the recipe and then read the review by lovestohost and used her suggestion of the cold spaghetti. I did not have any problems with the dough ripping. This came together quickly and baked up nicely. The taste was wonderful and the next time and there will be a next time I'm going to add a green pepper. Thanks sanzoe for sharing your recipe.",

Key is to work with cold precooked products (leftover chilled pasta already sauced). If you'r like me and like to add extra ingredients to pasta (vegetables. meat chunks etc) all the better and you don't need to limit to just spaghetti style pasta and cooked pasta will do. Another great add is cheese like mozzarella or jack cheese to make all ingredients stick together better inside crust.",
