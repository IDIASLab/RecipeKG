I slightly increased the amount of veggies and added 1 chopped celery stalk celery 1 quartered red apple and for herbs I added 1 tsp dried thyme 1 tsp dried rosemary 2 bay leaves and 1 Tbsp dried parsley (fresh herbs would have been better). For the beer I increased the amount to 8 fl oz and used Rickard's Red (I'd prefer to use Rickard's Dark but we were out). I cooked it on high for 4 hrs instead of on low. Extremely flavorful tender and convenient. My family and I loved it and will make it again. I highly recommend this recipe and encourage tailoring it by adding herbs/spices you like that compliment pork.",
