One word of advice, however. The recipe says to brown the pork then let sit on a plate. For some reason, I assumed you just brown the outside and it would all cook thoroughly later. I was wrong. You must cook the pork thoroughly when it is in the pan. Probably a blonde moment on my part, but if you are reading the recipe, understand it must be cooked during the begining. ",

I did of course change the recipe a bit. First I tenderized the meat real good then I made a marinade using wine lemon juice EVOO ( extra virgin olive oil) rosemary and cut up pitted kalamata olives. I let the meat soak in this for about 1/2 hour. I then follow the rest of the recipe according to how it is written. The difference is incredible as far as taste. When cooking meat it isn't just the taste but the wonderful aroma the accompanies the dish. I served the meat with red greek style potatoes and greek style green beans with feta and regular kalamata olives as an appetizer. This dish is favmassio! OPA!",
