I leave out the cayenne pepper for the kids' sake and use partially cooked brown rice. I've tried both cheddar and colby cheeses - not a big difference.  I usually make a double batch and freeze one.  Cook the frozen one (covered with foil) at 300 for 1-1/2 hrs, then uncover it and cook another 20-30 minutes.  Yummy!",

I tweaked it just a bit because I didn't have a couple things, and substituted a bit.  Otherwise, I kept the recipe as is.  I used the ground turkey and added a little worcestershire sauce and extra black pepper when browning with veggies for flavor (I had no white pepper, but didn't really need it).  Accidentally used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, but with the brown rice, it worked since brown rice needs a little more moisture.  I had no shredded cheese on hand, so sprinkled the top with parmesean cheese and broke apart some low fat sliced provalone I had and laid it out on top.  Yes it's spicy.. but sooooo fantastic!  And super easy!! I'd give this 10 stars if I could!! I will definitely make this again!!!",

Sauteed the cabbage in a little butter with 1/2 tsp cajun seasoning, mixed everything together and stirred in about another 1/2 tsp of the cajun seasoning - I used the cajun seasoning in place of all the other spices.  Topped the whole works with the cheese and baked it at 400 for 20-25 mins.  Perfect!",
