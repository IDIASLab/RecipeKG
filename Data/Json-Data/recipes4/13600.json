I would give it 4 stars on taste and texture, however I gave it three stars because I found it misleading that it called for only 3 1/2 cups flour and didn't give any sort of approximation for the amount of flour needed during kneading. I didn't measure the flour that I added, but I would approximate it to be around an additional cup. The dough was smooth and elastic, and on the stickier side (I didn't want it to be dry). This recipe is nice and simple though- I'd make it again and add raisins and maybe some vanilla extract to make it sweeter. This bread can be eaten savory or sweet.",

                "reviewBody": "I used my bread machine on dough setting and made it exactly according to directions. It was really sticky when it came out but used a few tbsp flour to make ropes and it worked great. We used the butter option to brush it I did initially think that 1 tbsp wouldn't be near enough but it worked beautifully. If you do this by hand you really only need to keep your hands floured when kneading. The more flour you add the drier it is going to get. As to the \"killing the yeast\" comment in my opinion your yeast may be old...this is a standard temp for water to bloom the yeast in. Or maybe salt was added while it sat. When salt is added to yeast while it sets to bloom it can cause it to die. Instead add everything and don't let the yeast set or wait to add the salt when you add the flour. The honey (sugar) makes the yeast to grow. Made our whole house smell AMAZING!!",

Although this was my first attempt at challah bread I would have to say it was a HUGE success! Great addition to our Christmas meal!",
