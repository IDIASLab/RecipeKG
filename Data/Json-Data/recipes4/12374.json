I used fresh kielbasa rather than smoked and I omitted the mushrooms and the raspberry preserves because I didn't have any on hand. The flavors in the dish would have lent themselves quite well to the raspberry preserves as long as the preserves weren't too sweet. I would add them if I made this dish again. The cheese grits were great. The milk really adds a lot of body to them. I was nervous about boiling the milk so I heated it on medium until it just started to bubble then I added the grits and stired constantly. This worked just fine. The timing worked out nicely as well because I was stirring the grits while the sausage was reducing",

Be careful with the type of sausage you chose-(did not like with maple sausage) but with \"normal\" smoked kielbasa was great. I used two kinds it was what I had. As we gobbled...it really reminded me of the little smokies served for appetizers...why not just throw out the grits and use this for your next appetizer??
