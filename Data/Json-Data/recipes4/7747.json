I used parchment on the pan, as aluminum and the acid from the tomatoes can leave a funky flavor.  While the tomatoes and peppers were roasting I loaded the blender with the other ingredients, so the whole thing only took about 30 minutes.  I would suggest letting it cool and the flavors mingle before serving.",

Used Mexican oregano and added additional cumin. Used more of the cilantro- added the entire stem and leaves to the blender since the stem is full of flavor. Also added some smoked paprika and ground chipotle to the mix to up the smoky factor. Pulsed it a few times and it was perfect.   Next time will make at least a double batch - so easy and delicious.    BTW.- I have spent a lot of time in central and southern Mexico and this is very similar to one of the salsa that myfriends have served me in their houses. Use on eggs or frijoles or add to quesadillas.  Very authentic.",
