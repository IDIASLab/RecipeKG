I've been married 45 years so I am no novice to the kitchen. I followed the recipe to the letter. The flavors blended beautifully. My \"pinch\" of cayenne pepper was 1/2 tsp. and my \"seasoned salt\" was Adobo. Hubby had 3 helpings humming all the way though dinner. I was worried that there wouldn't be enough gravy because I was serving it with mashed potatoes (I saut\u00e9ed onions and garlic and mixed it in the potatoes yummmmm!) but I decided to stick to the recipe and there was plenty of gravy. Definite keeper!!! Thank you Robin!",

Worked beautifully.  Also used fresh veggies, cause that's what I had. But did a pre-cooked to soften.  And had some chunks of leftover roasted baby red potatoes that I threw in.  I was worried they wouldn't maintain their structure, but it did beautifully.\n Thank you for a great recipe! This was my first attempt at making a potpie.  I was a little intimidated.

I did lessen the salt since I used packaged broth and because of aesthetics I used white pepper instead of black.  It is by far the best chicken pot pie I have ever made in the 45 years I've been cooking. My husband who is not a big pot pie lover ate 2 helpings. No little twists or doubled gravy. Perfect the way it is.  Note for beginner cooks: if you are making with skinless chicken pieces especially breasts, cook your chicken in a stock made from chicken broth, carrots, onions, celery & pepper corns.  It will enhance the flavor of the chicken. I forgot to mention that I used a 3 qt 9\" round casserole.  I think a larger casserole would make it a shallower casserole but that wouldn't affect the taste at all.'",

And I used our pie crust cause that's what I had. It was delicious ( I covered the edges with tinfoil the last 10 minutes). Thanks",
