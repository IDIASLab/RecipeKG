If you are going to pass the dough through a pasta machine right away (like I did), you can let the pasta machine do most of the kneading for you. I set my machine on #6 and pass the dough through 5-6 times until nice and smooth, folding in half and turning the dough each time before passing it through the machine. Once the dough is nice and smooth, set the machine on #2 and pass it through just once. Place the long sheets of dough on a lightly floured surface, and then cut into your desired shape.",

I'm not sure if it's me or the water where I live but I have to double the amount of water. I've used this recipe 4 times now and I consistently have to adjust the water. Again I know that humidity temp etc have a lot to do with it. I would encourage others to try this out and work with their dough. Finally I used 1/2 teaspoon of salt and it was great.",
