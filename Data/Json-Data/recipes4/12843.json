I am Italian, and this has been a staple in my Italian family since probably forever, and has always been my favorite vegetable. You can skip the red pepper flakes if you don't care for the extra bite. Or you can make this with bacon and garlic rather than the olive oil. Another great use for Swiss Chard (easily grown in your garden) is to add it to soups. SO much milder than other greens. It must be washed well, leaf by leaf, and you must make what you THINK is a ton of it because it cooks down so much. The prep, then, is time consuming, but SO worth it! The red-stalked variety is especially pretty, tho' I grow both red and green stemmed for the blend of colors when I make this. Another great thing about growing your own is that as you cut the leaves off, they keep growing back!  Can't wait for summer!",

One thing I did differently was to increase the blanching water to 3 cups and being aware that a bunch of swiss chard may not be the same everywhere I kept the salt to 11/2 tsp.I also added diced tomatoes and drained and rinsed cannelini beans. I also increased the garlic. It's a terrific side dish or you can make a meal by adding pasta cooked in the water used to blanch the chard. Great flavor and vitamins!",

When you buy a bunch of the chard, it looks like you could feed a small army with it. For those who've never cooked with it before, let me tell you that surprisingly, it cooks down to nothing. One bunch was only enough for two people, so I needed to add some spinach to it. Karen, we all loved this recipe and it went great with the flank steak I made! Hubby and my daughter are crazy about their greens and they asked for a repeat performance. Thanks so much Karen!",

I tweeked the recipe by adding fresh mushrooms, which I browned in a pan with 1/4 cup oil packed sundried tomatoes. The juices from the mushrooms,and the oil from the tomatoes,combined well with the garlicky chard mixture to create a fab sauce which I tossed with hot spaghetti. We topped it with grated Mezithra cheese. What a meal!  ",

A whole bunch amounted to about a cup's worth wilted, at most, but it was very tasty, and I'll be sure to use more chard next time.  I discarded the stems out of personal preference and drastically reduced the salt in the water.  I found it was still salty, so I will reduce more next time.  I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I used 1/8 tsp of ground cayenne pepper.  that mixed with the garlic gave it a great kick of flavor.  I served it with New Year Black Eyed Peas & Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread (both also found on allrecipes).  I stirred the chard into my bowl o' beans when getting ready to serve it, and it was a perfect complement, both texturally and flavor-wise to that dish.  So delicious!
