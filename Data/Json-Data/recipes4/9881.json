                "reviewBody": "First of all Arroz con gandules is made with white rice. You can make it with brown rice but it will then not be considered by anyone to be authenthic in taste. Salt is a must. Spanish olives are usually expected. Sofrito is always made with culantro (recao) and ajies dulces. Without the culantro you will not get that authentic taste you are looking for. If you like you can add a combination of any of the following: spanish ham, salted pork fat (tozino), chorizo. Aluminum foil is not needed if you have a decent pot ( I don't know anyone who uses it). How much water depends on your pot and the type of rice you use (long grain, medium grain, etc). I use long grain and one cup of water per one cup of rice. This is what works well for my pot. The rice should not be mushy or over-cooked. I always rinse my rice to remove the extra starch before I cook it. You will  be surprise what a difference that makes. Hope this helps.",

Which is probably why some of you said it came out bland. I would add a teaspoon. Also, two cans of peas is a lot, I would do just one. Extra garlic, and an extra packet of Goya's Sazon seasoning is my secret. I also use the fluid from the drained peas as part of the water (reduce water accordingly). Que rico!",

I sauteed an onion with a little oil to start and substituted 8 oz. of the tomato sauce with the soffrito and used Goya Culantro y Achiote seasoning. It was excellent! It took far less than 45 minutes to cook since I have a gas stove top, though. Good thing I checked on it because it would have burned. Perfect recipe and will make again.",
