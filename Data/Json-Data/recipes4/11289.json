Before I say what I changed I first want to say: thank you, Christopher, for sharing a very good recipe using chicken and brown rice.\n\n(1) Used 2-1/2 cups chicken broth instead of 2 cups water/bouillon; (2) I used regular rice, not instant, so cooked it in the chicken broth on the stovetop for about 20 mins (3) I added salt and black pepper to the chicken when I cooked it (4) I don't use margarine so did not put it on top.\n\nWhile the taste was great, neither I nor my family thought it looked very good and none of us would have tried it we saw it at a potluck.  I will definitely make this again but will add about a cup of coarsely chopped canned tomatoes for a more appetizing appearance and sprinkle 1/2 ounce of grated cheddar on top of each serving just before I put it on the table, also for appearance sake.\n\nIf you like rice, chicken, and spinach, try this.  Honestly, I wasn't sure how the cottage cheese would be in it but the consistency was very, very good.\n\nThanks again, Christopher!",

I also diced my chicken before cooking it for ease. Lastly I topped the dish with thick slices of tomatoes parmesan for the last 20 min of cooking. It was great - definitely a keeper. And it's ultra-amazing if you add Cholula Hot Sauce once it's served (if spicy is your thing).",
