I also misread the recipe and ended up using \"flavored\" (not Italian seasoned it has a milder more subtle flavor) breadcrumbs by a company called Jason. My husband Mike is usually a big fan of mushrooms but he felt they were unnecessary in this dish. Before he tried it he asked if he was going to want to put ketchup on it. He ended up eating his whole portion by itself so I'm taking that as a good sign. I really liked it and I'll definitely be making this again.",
