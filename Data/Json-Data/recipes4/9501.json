Because the vanilla makes it cream colored I made an additional 1/2 batch w/o vanilla for a middle white stripe. I liked that it hardens fairly quickly...if you apply one color stripe to all the cookies by the time you move on to the next color-the first has dried. Just stir in a drop or two of water to your bowl if needed. I like the glaze on the thinner side-very smooth and pretty on the cookies.",

If you have the frosting a little more watery it helps to blend and become more smooth looking.",
