So while cooking it for this recipe, I added to the water-cornmeal mixture: salt, pepper, minced garlic, ground cumin, whole cumin seeds that I'd toasted in a pan, chile powder, and onion powder.  In addition to the mushroom topping in this recipe, I also had a pico de gallo-style topping, and a garlic onion tomato sauce topping. I made a pile of lightly-steamed spinach in the center of each plate, placed several polenta slices on the spinach and garnished them only with a little coarse pepper and salt, and some sprigs of cilantro.  Then I made small piles of each type of topping in an array around the polenta so that toppings could be added as prefered by the consumer.  This went over really well and got rave reviews - the first time we've had polenta and liked it!",

Another tip it was difficult to transfer the cut polenta from the wax paper since I accidentally cut through the wax paper when I was slicing the squares. The waxpaper stuck to the polenta. So I just lifted it with teh wax paper and flipped it over when I put it on the baking sheet and then peeled off the wax paper. This worked well for me. This is a savory recipe.",
