This recipe lists the basic ingredients, but you should try adding other vegetables or ingredients to suit your taste. I typically add carrots and onions. Just be sure to add a little extra water to compensate for additional ingredients. If you aren't a vegetarian you can use chicken bouillon.",

Doggie-Daddy asked \"Are we out of food?\" and I replied \"Why no!\" and quickly searched for a recipe involving orzo et voila! -- this recipe certainly did the trick. It's a keeper. While cooking the smell is wonderful: like hashbrowns (potato is in the mix) and I do declare that Parmesan may be omitted... I tasted it before pouring on the cheese and it can really be eaten either way. Also added thai pepper for a touch of heat and didn't have carrots so yes! it's a good base to go on -- orzo potatoes onions garlic butter are the musts for this taste I think. Only thing though it took me longer than 30 mins. (the simmering alone is 12 mins.) and there's minced dicing peeling involved so I'd say it generally would take about an hour instead... or am I just a turtle. Eat it up dudes! Thanks.",
