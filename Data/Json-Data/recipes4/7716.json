It has no canned soup (rarity for casseroles like this and I loved that) and my concern was that it would be dry. The bread cubes are coated with honey mustard and I think that's what keeps it moist. I had no swiss so used a combination of muenster and cheddar which worked well. I didn't have enough time to let the bread cubes dry out for several hours so I put them into a 250 degree oven to dry out a bit. When I took off the foil I put the casserole back into the oven for about 5 minutes to allow the bread cubes to brown a little. The only thing that I will do differently in the future is cut back on the sweet relish. The combination of the honey mustard and the sweet relish made this a little too sweet for us (personal taste preference). I used a ham steak for this recipe but keep this recipe in mind when you're trying to use up some leftover Holiday ham. Thanks Jenn Brown we enjoyed your casserole!",

I used what I had on hand and combined with half pumpernickel and half sourdough. Didn't have the store bought honey mustard on hand so I made my own which actually turned out really good! Other than that followed the recipe. Have to say Jenn that I enjoyed trying out your recipe. Thanks for submitting!",

                "reviewBody": "I stuck to this recipe as written for a first try, with 2 small changes. I used a bit more ham, as that was what I had leftover. I also uncovered the casserole and added more cheese on top for a few extra minutes in the oven.\nThis did have a flavor reminiscent of a Reuben sandwich. I would think that using dill pickle relish vs sweet relish as called for is important to capturing the correct flavor. I was a little concerned that the honey mustard might be too sweet, but it was fine. When I make it again, I may switch to a sweet-hot mustard, just because I like a little bite.\nOverall though, this was a pretty good recipe and a tasty way to use up leftover ham.",
