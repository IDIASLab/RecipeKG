Once you have the pancake spread out in the oil, gently pour the egg on top. Also, two teaspoons of cornstarch really crispens up the pancake. Be sure not to lay on the batter too thick -- make it super thin to start with, as it will puff up a bit, even without the addition of baking powder. DELICIOUS!",

I love all Korean jeon(pancakes)and I often make this with the easiest recipe I am so used to: flour mix with chopped kimchi, more fermented the better, add water to make the mixture gooey and just pour it in sizzling oil. When it is fried crispy enough turn it over to the other side. I suggest no eggs to make the kimchi jeon more crispy and savory, eggs make it just too soft and moist. With this recipe kimchi cannot go wrong!:)",

Served with sides of miso soup and steamed kale. This is definitely replacing my old bland scallion pancake recipe.",

To make the outsides extra crispy and boost the protein level of this add part besan (chickpea flour - found in indian food markets) to the wheat flour specified. I like them with a 50/50 mix. Add a bit of sesame oil to the cooking oil to give a nice flavor. I also make these without the kimchee using other scrap veggies and indian spices in batter such as cumin turmeric coriander and/or garam masala. Sour cream or plain yogurt dip also good with indian version. Also can add thai curry pastes and fish sauce to spice it up.",
