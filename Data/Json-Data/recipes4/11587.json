Combine.  Add 1 or 2 cans Goya tomate sauce.  Finally add the pink beans.  Combine.  Cover and let all flavours marry.

I've used the canned and drained pinto beans before and it was without-a-doubt-delicious! The longer it cooks the more the flavors infuse into the beans just make sure it doesn't burn. If you want thicker broth try using the water the beans come in instead draining it. Or use 1/2 water 1/2 the bean water. MMMM!",

I quickly diced a small potato and plantain - you can get this at a Spanish food store and even some regular grocery stores - and sauteed them for a few minutes and added that to the rest of the mixture.  The starch helped thicken the bean sauce up.  I also spiced it up with some fresh cilantro and Adobo.  Added juice from can of beans as suggested and let it simmer for about half an hour.  mmmm. came out delicious.",

And I always do my own sofrito; onions, garlic, cilantro, culantro, cubaneli peppers, salted pork, and sweet peppers.  Sautee that in olive oil, then put cans of big KIDNEY beans, liquid and all, half a can of tomatoe sauce and cover with water. Add some cumin and some oregano and you cook it for a loooong time, at least a couple of hours.  A guiso always tastes better the longer you cook it. Then if you let it cool and reheat the next day it's even better! Don't forget to season with some salt and put in like a t sugar to cut off the acidity of the tomatoe sauce. Some people like it with a bit of potatoes (I don't) some people like some green olives (I do). And then you are done.  NOW you got some puertorrican habichuelas!!!! Oh yeah baby!!!!",
