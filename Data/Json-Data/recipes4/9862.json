The only things I did differently is slice the eggplant about 1/4 inch thick instead of 3/4 inch and I peeled about half of the peel off of it in verticle strips around the eggplant. I used 1 Tbs. olive oil in a non-stick skillet it cooked all the way through and nothing burned. Served over whole wheat spaghetti made for a perfect meal. THANKS!!!",
