I didn't use the crab boil and instead used 4 bay leaves tblsp cayenne pepper a bit of ground sage white pepper and 1 tbls ground thyme instead. The stewed tomatoes added a flavor that was just wonderful. It doesn't bother me that LASmith called it jambalaya. Would LASmith have gotten 5 stars if they'd called it Seafood Pasta? I think people can call a dish anything they want. I'd like to know why BJ didn't like it. We thought it was great and easy too. It makes a lot so I will cut the recipe in half next time but it will be nice for lunch at work on Monday!",
