I used 3 regular sized bags microwave popcorn, 2 cups holiday shaped pretzels, about a cup roasted peanuts, and 1.5 pounds (the whole package) vanilla almond bark.  To mix, I turned the lid to my round cake taker/keeper upside down and dumped everything into it and it worked perfectly.  Mixed with a large wooden spoon, then poured everything onto parchment paper to dry.  Couldn't be easier and absolutely delicious!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!  :o)  UPDATE 12/1/08:  For the kids at church, I leave out the peanuts and use M&Ms instead.  We've made this by the tons for VBS and other kid functions and they LOVE it!!",

A couple notes: 1- The vanilla confectioner's coating is a seasonal thing... couldn't find in 3 grocery stores (and I refused to use the White Chocolate); so I substituted in premium white chips. In making half the recipe one 12 oz. package of the white chips worked perfectly. 2-I used whole almonds just a preference... liked it fine. 3-For anyone confused on getting butter-free popcorn be assured you can still get plain no butter SALTED popcorn in the bag and this works great... or you could go old style and make your own on the stove!
