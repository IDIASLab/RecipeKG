We parents however really enjoyed this. A more creative way to eat beet greens and thankfully easy (but we left out the red pepper flakes). We always use the whole vegetable so this was one of three dishes from one bunch of beets. (I removed all the stems chopped them up and put them in meatballs and found a roasted beet recipe here too.) I do wonder what this recipe would be like with the chopped beets added. Kicking myself for not taking a pic - it's a good looking dish too.",
