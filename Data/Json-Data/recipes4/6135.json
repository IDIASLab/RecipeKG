Next, added the ground turkey meat stirring until the meat was no longer pink and in small pieces.  Then added 8 oz of no-salt added tomato sauce along with a 1/4 cup of hoisin sauce and cooked until all was thickened.  After taking the pan off the heat, I added fresh chopped cilantro leaves and 2 tbs of lemon juice.  Served as open faced sandwiches with freshly grated extra sharp cheddar cheese as a topping.  My Turkey Sloppy Joes was a fantastic meal which earned me the prized golden Stamp of Approval (SOA) from Mi Gato Loco.",
