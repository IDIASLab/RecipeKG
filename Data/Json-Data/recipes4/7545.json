While I kept all ingredients basically the same, I had already cooked potatoes and chicken on hand, which allowed me to save some steps, a lot of time and  less washing up. I needed some extra potatoes but I just cut up some raw potatoes in very small dice and added it to the pot.  At step #6, I put the oil in the pan (rather than mixing with the veggies first), and  tossed the veggies until tender.  At Step #8, I added the flour to the same pot to start the roux, added the flour, then the milk and cooked until thickened.  Followed by steps 9 & 10.\nProbably next time, I wouldn't bother with the bacon.  It didn't seem to provide a huge amount of flavour.  A very hearty soup.  I enjoyed it very much.",
