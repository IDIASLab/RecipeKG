Before it beggings to turn light golden brown you can add your vegt. And everything else. and yes milk will make it sticky.",

Add the vegetables (Try before the rice gets too brown, so it doesn't burn), and you can use water and chicken stock / broth, one or the other or both, if you wish. Milk is not used to make savory rices, it makes it sticky. Save the milk for when you make arroz con leche. ;-)",

Hubs and I are not big fans of cooked carrots but because I wanted the color it lends I substituted orange bell pepper instead. It along with the poblano peppers peas and corn made this \"confetti\" rice very visually appealing. I also gave the rice a pinch of saffron for added color and flavor tho' it wasn't necessary and certainly no criticism of the recipe. A great accompaniment to our Grilled Tequila-Lime Shrimp and Easy Grilled Zucchini both recipes also from this site. I would make this again in a heart beat. My only criticism is that it needs salt and pepper big time!",

HOWEVER my only complaint is that it wasn't fluffy like i would imagine Mexican rice should be. I think maybe substituting more water for the milk may do the trick. If it came out fluffy and not so 'wet' this would be amazing. I will definitely be making this again though just eliminate the milk and see if that helps. Thanx for the recipe:)",
