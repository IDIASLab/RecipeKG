Like most of the other reviewers I used ground beef instead of turkey. Instead of using sauce in the meat I threw in a little bit of stewed tomato a small can of diced chilis onion garlic salt and some taco seasoning into the meat. My squashes yielded a lot of meat so I put one squash on the bottom generously salted it put the meat on top of it then put the other squash on top of the meat. Also generously salted the top layer. I dumped all the enchilada sauce on top (and I am pretty sure I used more than 16 oz). For cheese on top I used cheddar and pepper-jack instead of Mexican cheese blend/queso fresco. Next time I'd just use one squash. It was way too much squash-to-meat ratio.",
