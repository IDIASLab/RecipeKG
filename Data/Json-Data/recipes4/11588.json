I used a very heavy teflon coated saucepan and did not have any sticking. I did substitute a 14 oz can chicken broth and omitted the salt. If the lid of your pan doesn't seal tightly wrap it in foil.. you have to keep the steam in as much as possible to get a nice fluffy rice. I also removed it from the heat for the last 5 minutes and let it sit. Do NOT peek! Remove the lid after 5 minutes off the heat and you'll have perfect rice with little to no scorched grains. Thanks for the great recipe!",
