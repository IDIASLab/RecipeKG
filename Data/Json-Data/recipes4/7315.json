Made with Owens\u00ae Original Breakfast Sausage, Ro*Tel\u00ae Diced Tomatoes, frozen broccoli cuts and Ore-Ida\u00ae Tater Tots\u00ae. I like it because it is easier than shepherd's pie. My friends and their pre-teen kids love it too. Spread more cheese over potatoes before baking if desired.",

I also sprinkled the potatoes with pepper and seasoned salt. Then I added it into the casserole dish with broccoli florets cheese cream of celery can and a can of Rotel tomatoes and chilis. Mixed it all together with shredded cheese covered and baked. FYI it still took an hour to bake. I topped it with Sour cream upon serving and oh my! It's pretty inexpensive to make too. Enjoy!",
