This is good! I did not add the pecans.  And I reserved the juice from the cherries, added water to make 2 cups and heated this up to dissolve the jello.  Next time I may try the cranberry jello instead of the cherry. But at any rate, this will become a traditional holiday dish in our house!  2006: Now I've made this over again with some successful changes: I used whole cranberry sauce and like another reviewer used an additional package of unsweetened gelatin.  I skipped the whole cherries since I had the whole cranberries.  It turned out yummy as before.  Now this Thanksgiving I am trying the cran-raspberry flavored jello instead of the cherry to give it more cranberry taste.  We'll see if it's consumed as rapidly as before!",
