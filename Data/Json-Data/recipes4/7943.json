Like all skinny or flourless pancakes I've tried these can be a little more difficult to flip because they are 'eggy' but if you're used to this style of pancake you'll have no problems. I love the flavor and texture. These aren't sweet at all so a fruit topping as suggested in the notes is a great idea. I topped mine with frozen raspberries that I simmered down with a bit of water. If I'm by myself I make just a half recipe. I use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to ladle out the batter. I also recommend cooking these over medium heat instead of medium-high so they don't get too dark. There's been a couple times where I ran out of eggs so I topped off the egg mixture with Egg Beaters egg whites and this worked just as well.",
