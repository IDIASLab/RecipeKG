In thirty seconds it becomes a hard lump that is impossible to get evenly mixed into the meat without completely overworking it. Cut down on the clove! 1/2 teaspoon is WAY too much. When these are cooking all you'll smell is clove. Not good. Lastly be prepared to get something on-the-fly to go with these. There is no sauce and the recipe mentions something about beef gravy but there are no instructions for one and the gravy is NOT listed as an ingredient so when you print up the shopping list the gravy doesn't get included. The taste is nothing but clove. Rather than dumping it out I quickly saved it by grabbing a jar of heavily flavored spaghetti sauce and boiling up some pasta. Luckily dinner was saved. Hand out dessert right away before someone notices the after taste and send everyone home with your apologies. Look at it this way you'll never have to cook for your friends again.",
