                "reviewBody": "I think there might be a few typo errors in this recipe. First of all 4 tbs EVOO is way too much. I had to drain the skillet of the EVOO in order for the sausage to brown. The sauce did not reduce after adding the white wine. I followed it as written and added the water and the tomatoes. The recipe never states what to do with the Romano cheese so I went ahead and added it to the skillet. After 10 minutes of simmering it and still having a soup consistency I added 2 oz of cream cheese to thicken it. The flavors were very acidic due to the tomatoes so I added a tbs of sugar salt and black pepper to taste. It ended up pretty good and this could be a 5 star recipe with these modifications.",
