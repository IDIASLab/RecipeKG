Since they didn't need to be rehydrated I simply cooked them in a pan separate from the sauce and blended them together before adding to the quinoa. I also just added a tiny bit of water to the sauce rather than the 1/2 cup the recipe called for- I wasn't sure how much water would have been left after the soy had been rehydrated so I just guessed- maybe 2 or 3 Tbs. I then doubled the amount of the sauce since the previous reviewer had said it was dry. This made a perfect amount and was really delicious though I think next time I'll add a little more peanut butter. It also only really made enough for my boyfriend and I so next time I'll definitely double the recipe as we easily could have eaten more and we both LOVED it. Very nice flavor and I love getting new recipes for quinoa!",

I also added about a tablespoon of Tamari (aged soy sauce) for a little more flavor and 2 teaspoons of chili paste instead of the chili because I didn't have one. In previous review there was some confusion about coconut cream. The cream is the part towards the top of the coconut milk can before it's mixed together.
