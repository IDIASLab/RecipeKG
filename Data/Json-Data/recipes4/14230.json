                "reviewBody": "I'm the submitter of this recipe. As I look at the photos that people have added I notice that the brussels sprouts look to be halved or even whole.  One of the most important steps in this recipe, in my opinion, is to slice the sprouts very thinly, almost shred them - the way you would shred cabbage for cole slaw.  This keeps the cooking time down so the sprouts don't get mushy - they remain somewhat 'al dente' particularly if you cook somewhat like a stir fry.  Also, AR modified my instructions and say to add the vinegar when you add the sprouts.  I don't do that.  I add the vinegar after the sprouts are finished cooking - stirring it in right before tossing with the bacon and gorgonzola.  It gives the dish a nice bite!",
