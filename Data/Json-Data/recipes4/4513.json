        "description": "With this recipe you can enjoy a taste of sausage and grits in a meatloaf. This recipe uses the grits as a binder instead of the bread crumbs used in a traditional meatloaf recipe.  The slow cooking method results in a firm yet moist meatloaf that not only tastes great for dinner, but can be thinly sliced for next day lunch sandwiches. Use your favorite barbecue sauce instead of ketchup, if you prefer. Serve alone, with gravy, with ketchup or BBQ sauce.    Makes great sandwiches cold or warmed in a buttered fry pan.",

                "reviewBody": "Let me respond to some of the less favorable reviews. Please use dry uncooked grits. You can also use 2 eggs instead of 1/3 cup of egg whites. Yes it will be drier than traditional meatloaf so use catsup salsa or your favorite gravy to moisten. Personally I can eat it without any help. Yes the taste differs from the traditional beef/bread crumb texture. It's more dense spicier and not as sloppy which is PERFECT for leftover sandwiches that has mayonnaise or mustard. My fav sandwich consists of mayo dill pickle lettuce tomato and sour dough bread. Yes you can use onion soup instead of onion powder/garlic salt seasoning. Let me know how that works. I am intrigued by one person's use of polenta instead of grits. I want to try that and see if the moisture of the polenta adds to the texture of the loaf.",

And there was really nothing to be worried about. 1st bite I had tasted like pure sausage(must have been a chunk I didn't blend thoroughly)...so I took that the whole meatloaf was the same taste all the way threw. I was wrong. It did have an italian flavor to it. But I'm not used to this style at all. It was very good overall and moist and no where did I feel or taste any gritty texture you would have never known there were grits as a binder in this recipe. However one thing I think bread crumbs or crackers do that grits do not. Bread crumbs and crackers soak up and mellow out the spices in meatloaf and grits are so small they do not. But that's not a bad thing. I'd see my self making again. My kids loved it loved it more then myself. But as long as they were pleased. Then that's okay..thanks",
