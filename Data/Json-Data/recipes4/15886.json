He told me how much he liked it when I debuted it at dinner and then again the next day when he ate leftovers for lunch and then the day after that he expressed disappointment when there were no more leftovers for breakfast. So thanks to his rave reviews and the ease of preparation this gets 5 stars. The rosemary flavor really makes the dish. It's amazing how a little of the herb goes such a long way.",
