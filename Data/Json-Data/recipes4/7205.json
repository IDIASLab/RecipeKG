I put in some celery also.  I used the beefy onion soup mix, because that is what I had.  I cooked it for 4 hrs. on high!  Everyone loved it!  Added alittle water with some corn starch for thickening, because of the extra liquid & it came out perfect!  Today, I added more potatoes & carrots and we finished it today!  Will make this recipe a go to one for Beef Stew!!!!",

About the only changes I made were, I browned the beef cubes before dumping them into the crock and I was afraid that it was going to be too dry so, I added a 480ml container of beef broth. In hindsight, I most likely didn't need to add the broth, as there seems to be a lot of liquid left over, but, I notice that another poster also added beef broth. Actually, I intend to freeze the leftover liquid and use as gravy? some other time. Will most definitely be making this again.",

Based on other reviews and feedback from my family, I have modified it over time to the following:  I brown the meat and substitute celery for the onion (I keep the onion soup mix).  I use a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, add 2 tablespoons worchestershire sauce and 1 beef boullion dissolved in 1 cup boiling water.   Enjoy!",

I also altered the recipe by adding mushrooms a rutabaga about a tablespoon of worchestershire and approx. 1/3 c. red wine 1/3 c. beef broth and about 1/2 c. of beef gravy. The original recipe broth to meat and vegetable ratio was good but since I added ingredients I wanted to increase the broth. I liked my additions. Very yummy. I will make this again soon. I'm sure the recipe would have been great as is. I think the cream of mushroom soup tomato sauce and onion soup mix are a winning combination. Thank you!!!",
