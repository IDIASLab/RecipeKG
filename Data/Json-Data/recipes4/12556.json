I use yeast from a jar and I read that the equivalency to a package is 2 1/4 tsp but maybe I need to add a bit more. Either way it is one of the best breads I've made and will be great in the fall with some beef stew!",

Both batches were very good and the crunch of the seeds makes it extra special. For those complaining about the bread being too dense I have two suggestions: 1. Use a mix of flours and 2. Note that the recipe calls for INSTANT YEAST. If you are using regular active dry you need to use just short of 3.5 teaspoons and I suggest proofing it first. Instant to active dry is NOT a 1:1 conversion.",
