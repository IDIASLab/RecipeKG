They also may be found in a specialty health food store or food co-op that works with local farms and foragers. The younger the leaves, the more tender they are. An easy and unique side that is both fun and special to serve. It is bursting with flavor yet simple as can be. We served it with roast meat and yam fries. The kids really liked it too. A few of us noted, strangely, that a clam taste was present.",
