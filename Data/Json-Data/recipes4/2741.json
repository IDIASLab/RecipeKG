(Might want to use low-salt or homemade chicken stock, as the cream-of soups can be a bit salty.) To stretch this further, add a sliced onion and another can of mushrooms. This is a very cost-effective recipe I make in the crockpot often, varying the ingredients I have in my pantry. Chicken can be bought marked down and most of the ingredients called for can be bought at a discount grocery store or the dollar store. It's great for energy conservation as the crockpot costs less to power than your stove. I like it over mashed potatoes, kids like it on rice or over egg noodles.",

I read the reviews and took some ideas from those.\nInstead of the cream of chicken soup and celery flakes I used one can of cream of celery soup and instead of cream of mushroom soup I used 2 cans of roasted garlic and mushroom soup. I used fresh garlic and I used a little extra because..well Im a fan haha. I am also a cheese lover so there was a little extra parm and I threw some mozz in there too. \nI had fun with it. It came out amazing! The chicken fell completely apart and my friends were really wow'ed. Im not a cook so this was a huge victory for me! Thank you so much for this amazing recipe it was a great crowd pleaser and I plan to make it again very soon! \nTo all that give a negative review...play with it a little. Add some of your favorite stuff if the flavor wasnt good enough for you. Its a great way to learn what you like and build your own recipe book!",
