First off I season my chops with garlic onion powder s & p.  Instead of sage we used a few dashes of liquid smoke or Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce, I use 2 cans cream mushroom  and the sour cream (no cream of celery) and I also add spices to the sauce same as the chops.  I make the gravy up in the same pan I just browned the pork chops in add potatos and French style green beans.  Then I put it in a small baking dish and place in the oven at 350 degrees until the pork chops are at 165 degrees and its Delish :)",
