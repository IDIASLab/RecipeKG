I've been a member on this site for over a year and this is the first review I've done. I make this meatloaf for my family an average of 3-4 times a month. Sometimes I'll use Spicy Italian sausage instead of the chorizo just to change things up a bit and I'll usually chop up a jalepeno or serreno pepper just to spice it up a bit more. It doesn't need any kind of ketchup or sauce to cover it cause it's already so moist especially when I cook it on my weber smoker which is what I'm doing tonight. Thanks for posting this recipe!",
