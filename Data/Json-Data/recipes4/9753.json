You must cook a whole, fresh chicken for the stock.  DO substitute rice as this is the traditional way.  Make sure you remove the soup pot from the flame before you poor the egg/lemon mixture over it.  Otherwise, the egg mixture gets clumpy.  Also, it is great when you add the chicken meat back into the soup.  This is how almost everyone eats it here.",

To top it off I added a handful of garden peas when the pasta was tender and a generous sprinkling of fresh parsley to finish. Delicious and highly recommended!!",
