I would recommend cooking the vegetable seperately since the rutubaga needs more time to cook and the other vegetables need less. I didn't pre-cook the peas at all and just added the frozen peas directly to the meat along with the other vegetables. I also would use a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce rather than 8 oz. because it didn't seem saucy enough (I added some left over pasta sauce we had in the fridge and it worked great). For the potatoes I used a whole package of the frozen Ore Ida steam and mash potatoes and they worked great:) Yummy!",

I used all the named ingredients, but I prepared them a little differently. After I browned the lamb, I took it out and drained it. Lots of fat. :) Then, in the pan I browned the lamb in, I added about 1/2 c white wine and threw in the other vegetable ingredients to cook through. I ended up adding about 1 cup of chicken stock as things progressed. I didn't want things dried up and I wanted a stew like consistency underneath the potato topping. I also went very heavy on the thyme, as the absolute best Shepherd's Pie I have ever tasted was at O'Lourdan's in Westminster and I racked my brain for days before identifying the most distinctive flavor as the lamb combined with thyme. I hate to be second guessing the original cook, but my question is, \"Why, after going through all this to make an authentic SP, would one use instant, or prepared mashed potatoes?\" I chose to do homemade, as have some others. The results were most astounding. And, if O'Lourdan's is in the least authentic, we got pretty close here. Thanks for a GREAT base recipe.",

I think it would also be good with deer burger. The \"with meat\" review is based on the feedback of 3 family members. I also made a small dish without meat for myself and I review that at the bottom of this post. The pie is very filling so I gave some of the pie to my mom and kept some of it for my husband and myself. All told we got four (2 person) meals out of it. It also freezes well. I'm making it again tonight and my mother requested the recipe. You do taste the rutabagas alot as I was hoping. It's a bit of a strange taste if you've never had them but they are very good. (I had a rutabaga sandwich in London but since I couldn't find a recipe for that I decided on the Whitechapel pie.) I highly recommend this recipe as it is good for you filling rather cheap to make and freezes well. It takes some time to cut up all the vegetables but the result is well worth it. VEGETARIANS: the recipe is great with soy \"burger\" crumbles. I've made it that way several times now and I love it.",

I also added a little soy sauce dry mustard (NOT the same as prepared mustard) chili sauce and a TB of brown sugar to the beef and I let the meat sit overnite in the fridge so the spices could really meld together. To the beef and veggies mixture I added some of the starch water drained from the taters and I topped it with cheddar as Parmesan is just too bland to put on top of such a hearty dish.
