Per other reviewers, I increased the milk by 1/2 cup and used a whole box of stuffing mix.  Also, I added 2 cups frozen mixed vegetables and 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning.  Lastly, I put the Tots ON TOP because IMO that's a requirement for a hotdish.  The result was hearty and tasty.  This goes into my keeper file.  BTW, it took 1 hour, 50 minutes from start to table; but maybe I'm just a slow prepper.",
