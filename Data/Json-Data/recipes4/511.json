I did use the evaporated milk, and i did increase the salt just a little. I cooked my noodles a little bit. I didn't cook them all the way to al dente, but i was leary about putting them in uncooked. I boiled them probably for about 3 minutes. The mac n cheese came out awesome. Made it on a Sunday morning to eat with football in the afternoon. Was very rich, but we like it that way. If you don't, subs reg milk for evap milk. It's easy. Watch and stir though, it can burn on the bottom. I cooked the cheese, milk, egg and seasoning for about 30 min before adding my hot pasta. Then i cooked on High about 1.5 hours. Then i turned it to low. It was done and ready to eat, I just kept it warm. Next time I will add some pepper. That's it!",

Tasted great although I did use sharp and extra sharp cheddar cheese. Probably only cooked for 2 hours after adding macaroni. Then as it remained in the crock pot until everyone finished eating the sides and bottom did get darker not burnt just a little brown and chewy. That I think is the best part tasted wonderful like the top of the macaroni and cheese you would cook in the oven. Thanks for the recipe it reminds me so much of a local restaurant's mac and cheese that closed several years ago. Will definitely be making this again.",

Also make sure you have time to stir it every 45 min-1 hour (or more frequently) so it doesn't burn! Here is how I made it and it turned out well... probably a little rich so next time I will use only regular milk and no evaporated milk but that's a personal preference. Anyway I used: 12 oz evaporated milk (can) with 1/4 cup skim milk since the can didn't come in a 16 oz size 2 tsp salt (could've used a dash of pepper) 1 egg beaten 2 tbsp butter 1 block velveeta cheezse (32 oz) and just over 1/2 pound of elbow macaroni ( 10 oz). I cooked the liquid ingredients for 1 hour stirring part of the way through. I then added uncooked macaroni at 1 hour and then only needed 2 hours to cook it...any longer and it would've burned/dried out. I would've probably been fine with 1.5 hours to keep it a little creamier but that's ok. I wasn't sure if the noodles would be softened by then. If you want a creamier variation I would boil the noodles for 3-4 minutes and then only cook it for 1-1.5 hours after adding the noodles to the sauce. It turned out well! But like I said it was a little rich so next time I will use only skim milk and no evaporated milk. Enjoy!",
