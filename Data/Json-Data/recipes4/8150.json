Because I prepared the 3 pans the night before, I did add about 2 cups extra milk to the tripled sauce recipe before assembling, to help it not dry out.

The day before: cook the noodles for 7-8 minutes (you want them still firm but not hard), rinse under cool water and cool completely.  Prepare sauce, thinning as noted above.  Assemble the dish per the recipe instructions.  Cover with foil and refrigerate overnight.  The next day, place dish into a 350 degree oven for an hour.  Uncover and bake 15 more minutes.",

To make a bit more adult, suggest adding some red pepper flake and mixing the parmesan with asiago cheeses.  You do need to bake as this sets the sauce.  The sauce will all sink while baking, but just give it a quick stir immediately after removing from the oven to even the sauce out.",
