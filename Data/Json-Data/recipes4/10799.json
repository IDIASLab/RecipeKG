Bring it to a boil; reduce heat & simmer covered for 3 hours. Remove pork & cool enough to handle. Shred meat with fork. Return meat to pot & cook uncovered until thick about 30 minutes. Serve it over corn chips with shredded lettuce minced green onions salsa shredded monterey jack & sharp cheddar cheeses & avocado cubes. Beautiful! The entire family loves it.",

I did the following: soaked my beans overnight added 3 TBS chili powder 2 TBS ground cumin several shakes of Adobo seasoning 5 cloves garlic 2 cans of diced green chiles and fresh ground pepper along with my appx. 4# pork loin roast. I also added 2 chicken bouillon cubes with my 1 quart water. Cooked on low for most of the day shredded my pork loin roast (it mostly just fell apart) then added it back to simmer until dinner. My 10 year old could not stop eating it!! My bean-hating 8 year old even loved it! Very tastey - a cross between a mexican shredded pork dish and chile. Will definitely make this again - it makes a LOT!! Great for a crowd!! I set out a myriad of accompianments to choose from - brown rice white and wheat tortillas tortilla chips lettuce tomatoes shredded cheese sour cream and guacomole - everyone did theirs a little bit different!!! Thanks for a great new pork (and crock pot) recipe!!!",

I have two young children so I didn't add extra spices as some have suggested. Both kids really liked dinner tonight.
