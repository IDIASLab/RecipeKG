I scoop them out with a spoon, roll them in my hands, and bake on a cake rack in the oven over a foil-lined cookie sheet. This way, they brown nicely, excess fat is drained off, and they can go right into sauce, or, in our family, meatball hoagies, along with sauteed onions and peppers. They also freeze very well when baked this way. When I take these to parties, I always get requests for the recipe.",

How funny! 3 meats, the breadcrumbs, plus 1 egg. You can also use fresh chopped spinach instead of parsley (or 1 pkg frozen, thawed and all water squeezed out) and pecorino romano cheese instead of parmesan. I make sure I have these on hand almost all the time, I use one lb of EACH meat, and it makes 30-40. Instead of frying, I par bake mine on a cookie sheet at 325 for about 10 minutes, then set the tray (if room allows) into the freezer for an hour or so. Pop them off the tray, into a couple of large freezer bags. Meatballs on demand!! Drop them into a sauce or steam in a glass casserole dish for about 5 minutes, they will be medium-well on the inside. Absolute crowd pleaser if you are making a big Italian dinner!! ",

I followed this to a \"T\" even though my experience as a chef was telling me not to. Too much cheese. Not enough garlic. And \"salt and pepper to taste\" is a personal pet peeve. If you are going to post a recipe, include all the measurements, or be prepared to take your lumps. This recipe is good enough to avoid disaster, but DO NOT FRY. They stick to the pan and melt away when you add them to the gravy(tomato sauce). Instead, bake them for about 35 minutes at 350. Then, put them in the gravy for the last hour or two. Replace half the cheese with more breadcrumbs. Less mess, healthier and easier.",

I scaled to 4 servings, used only beef, 85%, 1/2 cup italian style breadcrumbs and Kraft parmesan cheese, as my young children do not yet appreciate the stronger flavor of \"real\" cheese, and they both said they were the best meatballs ever.  Also, I did not fry them, to cut down on fat and clean-up, and they kept their shape just fine.  I just put them in the gravy and cooked them on simmer for 30 minutes.  The sauce was a simple marinara, just sautee 2 cloves of garlic, add 3 cans of crushed tomatoes, 1 can paste, 3/4 c. water and simmer.  Add 1T oregano, 1t. basil, 1t. onion powder, salt and pepper and voila!  Geanine and I teamed up to make an awesome dinner!  Thanks Geanine!",

We use italian style breadcrumbs and much less liquid (about 1/4 cup milk). What makes it so good is the ratio of meats.  You can adjust the flavorings to suit your family's taste.  Once browned, the meatballs can finish cooking in the frypan or by baking, or even add them to the sauce.  I would recommend this basic recipe to anyone.  Excellent addition to Allrecipes.com.",
