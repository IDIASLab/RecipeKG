I also up the veggies (and sometimes add diced carrots and/or apples) and up the honey mustard to 1/2 a cup when I make it low-fat to give it a little extra zing. Using fat free mayo does change the flavor which is why I up the honey mustard. People don't even know it's low fat when I make it this way.",

When I first mixed everything up w/ the dressing, I was a little disappointed that it was so liquidy, but after chilling in the fridge for a few hours, it did become less liquidy, although next time, I will add less milk (personal preference) just because I like macaroni salad a little drier. All in all, this was a great recipe and one that I will make again! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I added the milk in just until it reached the consistency we like I only used a 1/2 cup total. Our company loved it and they are pretty picky. Thanks Brandilynn for a great tasting mac salad.",

The salad was pretty with it and because the pasta texture was softer it worked well. I only put in 1/2 of the milk; do that too and add more later if you need to or else you might find the salad too watery. I made my own honey mustard by combining 1/3 mayo 1/3 honey and 1/3 brown mustard (like Grey Poupon)--just eyeball it in the 1/3 measuring cup if you are making the full 12 serving recipe. That means you will need to add more mayo because the recipe calls for it as well. My husband said I should have added more peas but I told him there weren't any in it (we realized that he thought the green pepper was peas--haha). So I added some peas (frozen and thawed) to the leftovers and it was even better! I think salad shrimp would also be a nice addition and then the salad (maybe with bread) could be a meal on it's own.",

My only recommendation is that you make it at least a few hours in advance to give the onion and bell pepper time to meld flavors. I ate some right after putting it together -- it was very good and then 5 hours later at the party -- it was even better. Will definitely make again -- maybe add some chicken or ham for a main course?",
