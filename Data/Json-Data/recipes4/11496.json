I thought I better add one of my recipes for others like me who love seitan and can't find any recipes for it. I use a lot of garlic, but it's not overwhelming at all. It had a very Asian smell and flavor to it which was not my initial intention, but it works great with noodles, stir fry's, over rice or with a side of mashed potatoes and green beans. Enjoy!",

My meat-eating girlfriend wasn t too happy when I cooked this although she said she liked it better than tofu. If you don t mind seitan and have had it before then I suggest the recipe. If you haven t had it before and looking to try something new I would avoid it.",

This one caught my eye and I'm glad it did! I didn't have a pepper so I left that out. I was a little confused about the purpose of the cornstarch since there wasn't any liquid to thicken up but I fixed that and made a gravy with some of the broth from the big pot of seitan and about a tablespoon of cornstarch. Brought it to a boil for a few seconds then turned the temp down and simmered as instructed. I served it over baked potatoes with lots of veggies on the side. It was just the right amount of spicy and the gravy made it taste like a nice expensive and fattening dish (but it wasn't expensive or fattening!). Yuuuummmmm.",

I made my own seitan (I've never seen it in stores) so I don't know how it's packaged.

I basically did as called for but I don't know \"chicken style\" seitan Whole Foods just had \"cube\" and \"strips\" I used strips. There wasn't a lot of liquid in the package so I added a splash of water before letting it all simmer. I also got two 8oz packages of seitan but it seemed like enough with just one. I made rice with a little lemon zest to serve it over. I cooked it for the recommended time to let the seitan absorb the flavors which it did but the bell pepper ended up far too cooked for my tastes (expected with that much time I guess). I thought the end result was still bland so I made a quick spice up at the end with Indian curry spices. This helped round it all out. I'm a carnivore but my partner is a pescetarian who does chicken now and then. We both enjoyed the end result and she finished it all up (no leftovers!) but I reached for the spice rack and I think this definitely needs a little something else.",
