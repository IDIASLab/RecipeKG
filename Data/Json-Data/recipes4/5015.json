                "reviewBody": "Chicken Fried Steak is breaded and fried in oil, like fried chicken.  One of the great tricks to a great chicken fried steak is to include a touch of sugar in order to caramelize the breading as it fries, then, when the steaks are all fried, leave some of the fried crumblies in the pan.  Remove as much oil as will not be needed for the gravy and make white gravy but only after browning the flour (use the leftover seasoned flour, complete with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and that all important sugar).  This produces a not so quite 'white', milk gravy, with a richer and more enjoyable flavor.  Don't try to bread recently defrosted meat unless it has been thoroughly dried, e.g. - with paper towels.  Mashed potatoes, skins still on, are fabulous with such a dish, and are most easily done via a crockpot, IMHO.... but it's all quite tough on the waist line, so we don't make it often any more...... *sigh*....",

Although it is a \"breaded\" and \"fried in oil\" steak, it is actually simply a browned steak cooked in gravy and certainly not \"chicken\" fried.  It is really tasty, however, and my family loves it with mashed potatoes!  As the creator of this recipe, I am sorry for any confusion caused by the title and hope you may give it a try anyway!!",

I will make it again because I really liked the gravy it made with the onions, but I think it is more like swiss steak, def not chickien fried steak.  Anyways,  I deglazed with dry cooking sherry after I fried the meat.  I did not have greek seasoning, which contains mint, so I just used italian seasoning.  I served with boiled okra and garlic mashed potatoes. Hubby and all 5 kids enjoyed it!",
