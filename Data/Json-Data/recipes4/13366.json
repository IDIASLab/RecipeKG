                "reviewBody": "I am sure many other reviewers will mention the various ways to cut the fat, but lard is the deal-breaker that makes authentic refried beans in Tucson, AZ. I have used this recipe before and I like it, although I also add wads of fresh chopped garlic and 1 tablespoon of cumin once the beans cook down a bit. Big deal: make sure you slowly add HOT water (better yet: HOT chicken broth) when cooking beans; it significantly cuts down on the potential starchy-bland flavor that can occur (got that advice from a Mexican cooking pro). Finally, for you sodium watchers...as this recipe cooks down, the salty taste will become more prominent. Add salt in 1/4 teaspoon increments near the end of cooking; let it \"meld\" and taste often. Cook as slow as possible. This is not a recipe that you throw together, as simple as it looks. But if you are wanting authentic tasting frijoles, without soaking (and slow-cooking) dried pinto beans for hours...this is darned close to the real thing!",

I used 45 oz of fresh cooked beans without broth (I cook my pinto beans in chicken broth with a ham bone for flavor). I ran them through my food processor to make them smooth and mixed them in with the 1/2 cup of butter (instead of lard). I cooked them to the paste consistency as stated, added the salt and then mixed in 1 cup of broth from the beans (still warm from cooking them). I then cooked it down to the desired consistency and froze them in 8 oz portions for later use.",

I've watched women make refried beans in the villages of Mexico with just plain old vegetable oil, so that is an option in a pinch too.  When I cooked these I mashed them with the back of the spoon to expedite the process.  Super easy & tasty!  To give them a little more flavor without adding texture, I added a couple spoons of the watery juice from some salsa. **update** I tried again with lard, like the butter version better. Also, a pinch of episote helps to make it a little more authentic tasting.  Salt IS important. I made Texas style baked beans for my DDs B-day one year and all the neighbor kids thought the silly gringa mixed up the sugar with the salt, LOL!",

And, I used the liquid from the beans instead of water.  Very few dishes in my kitchen escape without garlic, so a good heaping Tbsp. of minced garlic and a small can of diced green chiles sauteed in the bacon grease before adding the beans worked perfectly.  And, I topped the beans with grated Pepper Jack cheese.  Mmmm....  My family is still shocked that they are getting real refried beans, not out of a can, at home!  We even like these better than our favorite Mexican restaurant's.  Thank you Buffy.",

With one can of pinto beans.  I also used oil and not lard like a lot of posts listed.  And, I used about a tablespoon or so. I heated the oil.  While heating I opened and drained the can of pinto beans.  Then I mashed the beans once I added them to the hot oil.  With the oil you will not need any water.  If you add it do it a teaspoon at a time.  And, with the beans even drained they are loaded with salt, so it is not even needed.  Only 5 minutes to restarant beans. Nice!",

Yes it's ok to use rendered pork fat of some sort. I use 2 lbs of dried pinto beans soaked over night and cooked the next day with the desired Latin spices added to the cooking water. When mashing them I use some of the cooking liquid as needed to get them to the desired consistency. After mashing they go into a large cast iron skillet with the bacon fat melted and very hot. It takes 2 batches to do 2 lbs of beans but worth the time. After stirring several times I adjust seasonings for flavor, turn off the heat, let them cool and portion them into zip top bags for freezing. This way I always have ready made refried beans on hand and don't have to use canned ones.",

Soaked 3 cups dried pintos overnight then drained & cooked this morning for 1.5 hours with half an onion in it. Tossed the onion drained beans & reserved the liquid and followed the directions including lard. This is exactly like the authentic Mexican restaurants in the area... I kept sneaking back for tastes of it! I did add 1/4 tsp garlic pwd 1/2 tsp each cumin & chili pwd and 1 tsp chicken bouillon added to my bean liquid. As others say go easy on the salt you can always add a bit more at the end. With the bouillon I only needed 1 tsp salt and could have maybe used a tad less. For those who didn't use lard you really should buy some. It gives it a much better flavor than just veggie oil. It's called Manteca and you can usually find a white & green container of it in the Mexican aisle at Walmart or ask about it at your grocery store.",
