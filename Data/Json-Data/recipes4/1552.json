It tastes ok but who needs all that fat and mushy potatoes? Buy a good sirloin steak or london broil or even an excellent quality stew meat (that's what I use...no fat). Add potatoes the last hour of cooking and turn up to high. No mush. No fat. This benefits from adding a sliced jalapeno pepper to it always. Canned beans (black pinto red etc.) can be added the last hour also. Corn makes a nice addition too.",
