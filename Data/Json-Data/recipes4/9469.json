I baked it 3 hours in total it was a little dry (compare to what I have had before). I suggest people who try to cook goose for the first time should realize that a goose of same weight of a turkey would give less meat. I mean for my 11 goose 3 lb was the grease-- I measured it! It is harder to carve than a turkey too. I served 10 people with this goose and each person barely got 2 piece of meat. It was a good thing that was a pot luck so there were other meats. I took the left over home and picked out the rest of meat and cooked a soup. The next day my family of 4 had a soup noodle with goose meat -- chinese style.",

We also were disappointed that there was not much meat. It served 3 adults and 4 children with a little left over. I had planned to take some to a dinner party the next afternoon but I hardly had enough to fill a tupperware. My kids absolutley adored it (they love dark meat and crispy skin and they would really eat much else of their dinner) and have been asking ever since for me to make it again.
