It has to be cooked on low heat in order to evenly toast the bread as well as melt the cheese inside.  My husband, bless his heart, cooks EVERYTHING on high heat so that he can finish faster.  His sandwiches tend to be burned on the outside while the cheese inside is not completely melted.  With that said, I make mine with whole wheat bread and sharp cheddar cheese, served with tomato soup and a sweet pickle.  This is one of my favorite lunch or dinner meals.  I truly enjoy this site and the reviews and tips, which are mostly well thought out and constructive.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.",

Back in the late 80's, when I was in high school, my friends aunt was doing Weight Watchers.  They told her to, instead of using butter on the outside of the bread, apply a thin layer of mayo.  It grills up great, adds a little extra flavor, and is less fattening than the butter.  It spreads thinner so you hardly use any but still have something to give you a crispy crunch.  I also add mustard to the inside.  Yum!  All 3 of my kids love it this way.  Great post!",

But for those looking for a truly different addition to an old favorite, try this. \nMake the grill cheese sandwich as usual, but without buttering the bread. When the cheese is melted to your likeing, remove the entire sandwich from the pan. Since both sides of the bread will be lightly toasted, you can now dip both sides of the sandwich in an egg batter and return it to the pan. If desired, one may be creative with the egg batter using a spice of your choice, such as garlic, even finely minced fresh onions. Anything really. If you butter the bread prior to placing the sandwich in the pan, the bread will get soggy and will not cook the eggs properly. Try it and be pleased with your invention.",
