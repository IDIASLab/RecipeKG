Be sure to cut the chicken into parts, remove any giblets, and rinse the chicken before boiling it.  I prefer to add some salt to the pot, which this recipe doesn't do.  The amount is up to you (start with 2 teaspoons if you're not sure).  You can remove the chicken from the pot as soon as it's done, if you prefer, rather than waiting for it to be \"falling off the bone.\"  The white meat will be done before the dark meat.  If you leave the spine in the pot after removing the other parts and let it stew for a while, then strain the solids out with a sieve, you have some nice chicken broth to use for soups.  Let it cool, and remove the fat that rises to the top.",

I freeze small portions in ziploc baggies & then use in my dogs' dinner (my vet advocates boiled chicken for my dogs)or in many other recipes calling for chicken.  I do leave the veggies in big chunks for ease of removal. To clarify stock for clear broth, removing solid flecks that are too small to be strained out with cheesecloth, follow this method. Separate the egg white from the egg yolk of one egg and reserve the shell. In a small bowl, combine 1/4 cup cold water, egg white, and crushed eggshell. Add to strained stock, and bring to a boil. Remove from heat, and let stand 5 minutes. Strain again through a sieve lined with cheesecloth. From cloudy to crystal clear in no time!

I am responding because of the number of people who stated they are using boneless,skinless chicken breasts for this!?!?  Why? The whole point of boiling chicken is to leach flavor from the bones and skin (where the flavor is) into the water for stock and so you can easily remove the meat from the bones and skin afterward.  This allows you to use a more economical cut of meat(i.e. bone in skin on chicken breasts,etc.) for your meals that call for shredded chicken (casseroles, chicken salad, etc.) and to save the more expensive cuts for your meals that call for a cutlet (cordon bleu, chicken parmesean, grilled chicken etc.) I would imagine boiled bonesless skinless breasts would result in a very bland stock that would require several buillon cubes to add more flavor as well as very bland chicken meat.
