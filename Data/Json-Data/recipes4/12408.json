I have made some changes that make it easier for me on a weeknight: I put the chicken (sometimes I even use frozen-solid breasts or thighs) in a crockpot with the taco seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, chopped onion + a little water in the morning.  Then when I get home from work the chicken is easily shredded and I add the other filling ingredients to the crock pot and stir it up. Then I just assemble per the directions.  I also use green sauce instead of red. This way it only takes 15min to get them in the oven and the meat tastes great from simmering all day in the spices.  Thanks Angela!",

As another reviewer mentioned, I placed the frozen chicken breasts in a crock pot on low with chili powder, onion, taco seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder. That evening I shredded the chicken inside the crock pot in under 2 minutes, added the green chilies, and lime juice. In a separate bowl I mixed the cream of chicken, sour cream and more chili powder. I omitted the butter all together saving calories, and it won't be missed. Then I layered half the cream sauce on the bottom of the 9x13 inch pan and mixed the rest into the chicken mixture still in the crock pot. Then I placed a layer of tortillas (I used corn) in the pan, followed by the entire chicken mixture, cheese, another layer of tortillas, enchilada sauce, cheese, and olives. Prep time for the entire meal was 10 minutes. Trust me, you won't be disappointed! Next time I will use green enchilada sauce (personal preference for chicken.)",

It was so good, that I can honestly say I will quickly whip that together any time I find a recipe that calls for cream of chicken soup.\n\nThese enchiladas were super, super good.

If you have a gas stove, place the tortillas on the burner of the stove for about 20 seconds to gently char them before filling and rolling them.  ",

Also, I added some salsa, extra lime juice, and garlic powder to the soup/sour cream mixture.  I like mine extra saucy so I also made sure to double the soup/sour cream mixture.  Yum!",

                "reviewBody": "This has been in my box for months and I finally made them yesterday.  It is a good recipe in many respects.  However, for the time it takes it doesn't deliver enough on flavor.  I followed others' advice and did the chicken in the crock with taco seasoning and with a 1/4 cup of jarred jalapenos in juice to up the flavor of the chicken which was excellent advice.  When simmering the chicken in the skillet, I replaced the water with a 16 oz jar of fire-roasted salsa and tossed in a can of corn for color and texture.  Given the amount of work that goes into it, we were expecting some knock-your-socks-off Mexican flavor.   Even with the onions, the chilies, all the seasonings, the salsa and the enchilada sauce, we all found it a little bland.   It was pleasant and I'm sure kids and those who don't like spice/heat would love it.  But if you're looking for a good solid spicy enchilada, you'll probably be a bit disappointed.",
