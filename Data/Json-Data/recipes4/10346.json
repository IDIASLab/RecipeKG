My grandma had this same recipe, but a couple of things were different, and I think it would help with some of the things that others complained about.  First, use 1/3 cup milk instead of 2/3 cup water in the batter.  Second, use 1/2 cup strawberries (undrained) for the cake.  For the icing, my grandma's recipe called for 1/2 cup margarine, 1 - 1 1b. box of powdered sugar, and 1/2 cup of strawberries, DRAINED.  That makes a TON of icing, so I halved it, and it was the PERFECT amount:  1/4 cup margarine, 2 cups powdered sugar (which is 1/2 a box), and I still use 1/2 cup of strawberries, DRAINED.  Excellent cake!!  Thanks for the recipe - now I have it online!",

I was afraid the edges would burn before the center was done, but the cake turned out spectacular. I added 1 1/2 Tablespoons of lemon juice because the batter tasted way too sweet. I mashed the strawberries, then added them to the cake batter. I'm not sure if this is the proper way to prepare the cake, but it turned out fine. I used a 6oz package of gelatin; half for the cake, the rest I put in my  cream cheese frosting recipe made with less sugar and a tablespoon of strawberry all-fruit preserves. If you take this suggestion, make sure to adjust the sugar in your frosting for the sugar in the strawberry gelatin. I didn't use the frosting suggested because I thought it sounded way too sweet and bland. I cut each cake layer in half to get more frosting in the cake because the cream cheese frosting with strawberry flavor is excellent.  My family loved it. ",
