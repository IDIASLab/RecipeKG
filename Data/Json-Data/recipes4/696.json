It was really good. The flavour was quite different! I loved it! The only change I made was to omit the salt. I almost never add salt. Next time I won't toss the cabbage with the liquid from the oranges, I'll mix it (and the seasonings) with the mayo. And I would only use 2 Tbsp of mayo. Also, add the oranges last so you don't crush them when you stir.",

I did not have any white pepper so I left that out and I may or may not have omitted the nutmeg. Overall it was pretty good but I felt like it needed more ginger and perhaps a bit of sugar.
