After 30mins at 350, I ladled sauce on top of the meatballs and cooked another 15mins.  I also used half ground beef and half italian sausage-which did add to the baking time.  I did make a few with just ground beef and the whole family agreed, the ones with sausage were far and away the best.  I served these over egg noodles but do not recommend the tomato soup sauce as a gravy.  I think good, homemade spaghetti sauce would be better, after they were baked with the original sauce.
