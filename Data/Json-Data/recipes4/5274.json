Lobster or any seafood only needs to be steamed or broiled until opaque - no more than a mere 10 to 15 minutes. Rule of thumb for seafood: 10-12 minutes per 1-inch of thickness. I like my seafood on the drier side so I cook it for 12-15 mins per 1-inch thickness sorry Chef.",

Since reading comments about what didnt work or what people didnt like my review is merely my opinion and adjustments inspired by this recipe. Here's what I tried: I took my frozen lobster out of freezer and thawed it in cool salted water. Once thawed I cut the top of the two lobster shells from head to tail and pried the shell apart a little so I could get my butter etc into the meat. When I make this again (very soon) I would take the other reviewers' suggestion and remove the meat as one piece add my oil S&P etc.. THEN put the meat back in the shell to broil. I poured about 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil on the bottom of my glass oven safe dish (didnt have tin foil) and added a few slices from a garlic clove into the oil on the bottom of my dish. Place the two tails on top of the oil and garlic. Pour aprox 1/2 tsp of oil onto meat Sprinkle salt & pepper on meat as desired Since I didnt have breadcrumbs and being cautious as not to \"over do it\" and lose the lobsters flavour; I took a handful of herb/garlic crutons crushed them up then sprinkled onto lobster meat sparingly. I put the rest of the sliced garlic clove into my 1.5 tbsp of butter and microwaved it till melted Pour melted garlic butter onto lobster meat on the top of the bread crumbs/crutons. I added another half garlic clov",
