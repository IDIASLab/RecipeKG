Do not hesitate to try this. You can't go wrong. I used a frozen package of tortellini which I believe was 19 ounces instead of 18oz. the recipe calls for. I also chose to use cherry tomatoes because we prefer them over grape. The salad was easy to make, too. I used my kitchen scissors to cut up the bacon and onion so the process went quickly. I also used a full 12oz. bottle of coleslaw dressing. That's what was available and I didn't want a partial jar left in the fridge. I added it slowly to make sure I wasn't killing the consistency, but it turned out great. Bottom line here is that this recipe is also very forgiving on proportions used. Above all- if you are reading this recipe, don't hesitate to try it. My many thanks to the submitter! My family thanks you, too!  UPDATE: I can't stop making this!! This is my most repeated recipe from this site! Make sure to make it the day ahead. It is much better after the ingredients have had a chance to meld together.",

Now, I cut the bacon up into small pieces, several slices at a time, and then just put the entire pound of bacon in a skillet and cook it together-- MUCH easier.  I also throw in my favorite spice at the end, which is lemon pepper, so I encourage you to kick it up a notch with your favorite pepper or spice too.  I love the addition of a handful of sunflower seeds.  And feel free not to use refrigerated tortellini-- you can use whatever kind of tortellini you like (as long as it's cheese!).  One more thing, I try to make varying degrees of crispiness for the bacon-- some chewy, some crispy.  Thank you guys!",

I blanch the broccoli by throwing it into the water with the tortellini for one minute (when the tortellini is almost done) and then drain tortellini and broccoli together and rinse under cold water to cool. I add 1 large stalk of celery finely diced. I use a thick sliced applewood bacon for this recipe and cut into 3/4 inch pieces. For the dressing after frying the bacon and draining off the grease I add a little bit of water (3 tbsp?) to deglaze the bacon pan and stir to scrape up all the tasty bits. To this I add 1/2 tbsp. horseradish and a scant 1/4 c of bottled poppyseed dressing. This salad is a flavor explosion.",
