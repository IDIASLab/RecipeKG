Otherwise I will make it again but leave out the 1 tsp. of salt entirely since the cottage cheese already contains salt and I prefer things not too salty. For my husband the level of salt was fine; he likes a lot of salt. However he thought it wasn't crispy enough and should be baked a little longer than the 30 minutes to get crispier. One tip: Be sure to drain your spinach very well ( take the time press all excess water out.) It easy to prepare. but I did make 2 changes: I didn't do the 2nd egg brushed onto the dough. I used refrigerated pastry puff sheet that was already ready-to-use.",
