The only changes I made were to use: 1)stock cubes (chicken and veggie stock with 3 cups of water - normally each cube takes 2 cups - kept that simmering on the stove while I prepped the other ingredients so it reduced a little bit more); and 2) one large sweet potato cubed. I think the stock and sweet potato added a nice depth of flavour. Next time I make this I'll skip the skim milk and instead use a dollop of fat-free creme fraiche in each bowl. Also I'll roast the pumpkin first (think this might make for a nuttier flavor).",

This was very easily fixed with a LOT of spices. When I first saw a dash I almost laughed. I ended up putting in about 3 tablespoons of nutmeg 1 tablespoon of ginger and 4 tablespoons of cinnamon. I also used a sweet potato as suggested. Finally to give a little nuttier flavor. I added about 1/4 cup of hazelnut fat free cream. This definitely kicked it up. All told it was a lot of fun to work with a girlfriend and figure out what to add to the soup.",

I pureed, the potatoes, carrots, apple, onion and garlic in a food processor and sauteed in 4 tblsp. of butter until soft.  I transfered everything to a large pot, including the pumpkin puree which my so generous girlfriend gave to me after doing all the work, and then I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of maple syrup, 2 tsp of cinammon, 1/2 tsp. of ground ginger, 1 tsp. of ground nutmeg, 1 1/2 tsp. of salt and a handful of chopped fresh parsley.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of dry thyme and 5 cups of chicken stock.  I used Herbox Instant bouillon very tasty.  Bring to a boil and simmer for about 30 minutes, cool and then use a hand blender to puree and remove any lumps.  My finicky 10 year old loved it and enjoyed watching me prepare it and expirimenting with different ingredients to add flavor to this soup.  I love fine dining and I believe that this soup could sneak its way into one of those fancy restaurants I like to frequent.",

I used liberal amounts of cinnamon nutmeg and (most importantly) salt. I pureed part of it well but left part chunky and that gave it a good texture.
