Before I whipped the cream, I placed my mixing bowl and beater into the freezer for about 15 minutes in order for them to be chilled. I used a pre-made Oreo chocolate pie crust.  I also used chocolate/vanilla Kraft marshmallows.  My candy bar was chocolate with almonds and I put the candy bar into the food processor and pulsed until finely chopped. For my decorations, I cut miniature marshmallows into flower shaped petals and used a yellow M & M in the center - creating daisies. The pie was light and fluffy with a definite chocolate flavor. When I first read the recipe, I noted there was not any sugar added to the heavy whipping cream and pondered adding a couple tablespoons of powdered sugar. I wish that I had followed my instinct and added the powdered sugar to the heavy whipping cream as I think this would have made a much better pie. The pie sliced and served beautifully. I will make this pie again and add the sugar and perhaps some espresso powder. Thanks for sharing cookerboy222!",

I liked them both - not sure I could pick a favorite... I read \"alow mixture to cool completely,\" and was trying to figure that into my schedule. What I did was to make the chocolate mixture when I got home from work, late at night. I let it cool a bit, stirring occasionally. I noticed a \"skin\" forming, so I covered it directly with plastic wrap, and went to bed. In the morning, I whipped my cream [first time!!!] and then beat in the chocolate. It worked just fine (= I thought I screwed up my second pie, when I did not rinse the beaters in between. I didn't see a point, when I was basically mixing the same things together, again. But the cream took a LOT longer to stiffen the second time, and I thought I'd blown it. It worked fine ~whew!~ I did use one Keebler shortbread crust, and one graham cracker crust. I think this would be really good with a pastry crust - but whipping cream was enough of a challenge for this cook this week (= My co-workers enjoyed this very much!",

I used an assortment of milk and dark chocolate bars (thanks to Molly for the Ft Wayne bars!) dark chocolate chips and semi sweet chips. I chilled my beaters and the bowl before whipping the cream and my little hand mixer with the whips beat that up in no time flat! I did taste it and decided to add a bit of powdered sugar. I piped the filling into the mini tins and then just a shot of canned whipped cream and some chocolate sprinkles on top. So light creamy and chocolatey goodness. What could be better?!
