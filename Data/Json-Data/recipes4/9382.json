The trick is to not put the cream cheese with all 4 C. of milk or you will get lumps no matter how high you turn on the blender.  Mix all of the cream cheese with a small amount of milk until smooth and slowly add the rest of the milk while blending and the mixture will stay smooth.  I hope this helps!",

The only thing I do differently from the recipe is to put a layer of chocolate icing underneath the pudding mixture to make it taste just like an eclair. I use the icing from the recipe on this site called \"Eclairs II\" submitted by Patty. With the addition of chocolate, this dessert is irresistible! I also take the Hershey's Syrup and drizzle it in lines over the top of the Cool Whip and run a knife tip accross to make a pattern, which comes out very pretty. The chocolate *REALLY* makes this dessert. Hints I would offer are, try and spread the dough mixture as evenly as possible in the pan before baking but don't get upset if it puffs all over the place and looks unshapely. Just give the big bubbles a squash as you assemble. The cream cheese and milk don't like to blend smoothly, start with a little liquid at a time to encourage the lumps to go. I've never had it seem lumpy in the end, even when I wasn't able to get it totally smooth. If you are really feeling decadent, try using half and half instead of milk with the pudding. I never have leftovers of this!",

The dough part may seem intimidating, but it's very easy! After baking, it bubbles up quite a bit, but i just pushed the crust down to the bottom of the pan to lay flat for filling. I spread a whole jar of hot fudge in the bottom of the crust, then proceeded to fill with the pudding/cream cheese mixture. By the way, as users mention, make sure you beat this VERY well to get the clumps out. I had to put the whisk attachment on my kitchenaid mixer and put it on high to make it smooth. And furthermore, it doesn't taste anything like cream cheese, but it turned out perfectly regardless so I'll still be sticking to the recipe. I topped with the cool whip and drizzled Hershey's chocolate syrup, then also added crumbled chocolate cookies on top. I could probably eat this whole pan myself! One important thing to note, this tastes like a gigantic eclair, so I personally would name this \"Eclair Pie\" since it doesnt seem at all like a cake, or like a cream puff. Highly HIGHLY recommend.",
