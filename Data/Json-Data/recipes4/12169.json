If you can, use fresh finely chopped onions, not dried, and fresh minced garlic instead of or in addition to the garlic powder.  I also throw in some finely chopped green bell pepper sometimes.  Fresh is just always better to me.  And they left out the thyme.  Or maybe I forgot it.  Who knows?  About 1/2 teaspoon in the sauce while its simmering.  Yum.  ****Just a note, for those of you using the ready-bake noodles, it is NOT necessary and I really don't recommend it.  My recipe does not call for it if you look closely.  I use REGULAR lasagna noodles and make sure they are fully covered by a watery sauce cuz they will soak it right up.  Much better flavor than pre-cooking noodles separate in just plain water!!  And use lots of sauce!!  ****To give this a health boost, I throw kale and mushrooms in the food processor for a super fine chop and mix it in with the cooking beef and sausage.  My kid has no idea he's eating greens and anti-oxidant loaded mushrooms.",

Once this has been added together and blended to almost smooth - set aside. Take one pound of ground Pork and one pound of ground Beef and brown them in a skillet. Once the meat is browned throw a few cloves of fresh Garlic minced and the sauce and let simmer for about an hour. Use this sauce for the recipe as described above.",
