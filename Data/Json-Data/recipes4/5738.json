I have never quite gotten it right, but this weekend I decided to break the rules and make it how I thought it would taste best, and it worked for me! Even if you don't usually love tomatoes I would recommend giving this a try. If you can use heritage (coeur de boeuf) tomatoes, do it! That is what I used today and it was great. I think the quality of the tomatoes will make a difference for the recipe.",

I was afraid the amount of olive oil would make it runny but it emulsified enough and made a wonderful filling. I drained my tomatoes for a few minutes so they wouldn't wash out the tart and baked it in a small stoneware pan. It did feel and taste like something I would eat in a French bistro or cafe. Simple tasty and divine! I look forward to making this for girlfriends!",

After placing the ingredients in the pie crust, instead of crimping the edges, I folded the excess over the filling.....about one ince.  I did have to bake it longer to get a nice crisp crust, but it was absolutely to die for.  Even the next day at room temp!  Great recipe...thanks pocohr.  It's a definite keeper.",

I think this helped greatly, since the pie was still just a touch on the too moist side. Also, instead of fresh herbs I used dry. That way they could be added into the pie mix and baked in without being burned. I layered the generously sliced tomatoes half-stacked on one another so that there was basically two layers, to help give the tart some depth. Finally, I had plenty of pie crust left over (home made) so I cut strips and laid criss-cross over the top.\nTaste: not as \"tangy\" as the recipe name would indicate. Not sure how to do it, but if the \"tangy\" factor could be raised would really be a great dish. However, was quite a nice dish. Even as a leftover it was good.\nWill definitely make again.",

I did use all of the tips in the AR Premier magazine: 1) Used a 400 degree oven. 2) Dust the pie crust with flour before spreading paste. 3) Used a blender to make the paste. 4) Topped the tart with the one sprig of oregano and thyme after it was baked. 5) Magazine time was shortened to 40 minutes due to the increased oven temperature; mine was done closer to 35 minutes. Thank you pocohr and AR for bringing this delight to our table!",
