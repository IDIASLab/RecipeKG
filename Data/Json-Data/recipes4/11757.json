This was a huge hit at my potluck and I'm making it for Christmas this year! Gruyere cheese, sherry, broth and cornstarch are my additions to make it lovely and so, so flavorful. To die for!\n\n-Fry the onions in the olive oil until they start to carmelize. \n-Add the carrots and celery and cook for about 5 minutes.\n-Add all the mushrooms and stir-fry together with the other veggies until they are all browned, tender, and fragrant. If the carrots and celery are still a little too firm, they'll soften as the pie bakes.\n-Add 1/2 C Sherry and the tamari. Whisk in about 1 T cornstarch (as you would the rice flour) and simmer until the mixture starts the thicken and bubble.\n-At this point, add the potatoes and whisk in as much veggie stock as you need to reach a desirable consistency.\n-Grate in about a 1/4 C Gruyere cheese!\n\nThe filling is done. Prepare the pie as you would according to the recipe. Grate a little gruyere cheese over the top before popping it into the oven and you will be in heaven! ",

For example I used all-purpose flour for the gravy and almost doubled the measurement and used vegetable stock and wine in place of the water. I also made my own crust. I agree with other reviewers that this recipe makes about twice the amount of filling you need for a 9-inch pie. This recipe is a great start though with a few modifications.",

Most importantly make sure the filling is liquid enough (about the consistency of gravy) as it doesn't taste good when it's too thick and some of the water will evaporate in the baking. However if you're using all-purpose flour instead of rice flour you can use 1 1/2 times as much. Also it's a good idea to taste the filling while it's cooking and add extra soy sauce (up to 1 1/2 times as much total) if you find it's too bland. The carrots and celery should be added to the pot with the onions and mushrooms so that they end up soft instead of crunchy. Finally make sure the pie crusts you use are unsweetened (0g sugars in the Nutrition Facts) so they fit with the filling.",
