As one reviewer did, she did not get the proper consistency. After you've boiled it for a minute, turn the heat off, and put the lid on and leave it just like that, overnight. In the morning, stir it up til well blended, transfer to a container to then store in your fridge.   In the morning you will notice that the pumpkin has settled on top of the oats. Stir to combine.  At this point you can reheat slowly with a splash of milk, over low heat stirring constantly, til heated through, or microwave for 1 min, 30 sec. in individual servings. Thank you.",

Not crunchy, but just enough chewy texture for me. I took the submitter's suggestion in the intro and added sweetener, cream, and toasted walnuts. Delicious! These oats are a little thinner than my usual, but perfectly acceptable. (Weeble, the submitter, told me that she makes these oats the night before, covers them, and lets them sit on the stove all night. This allows them to thicken much better. Putting them in the frig cools them off too quickly and makes them thinner. I think next time I will definitely let them come to room temp before putting them in the frig for the night.)",
