        "description": "Bangers and mash gets its name because sausages used to burst (or bang) while cooking, due to rusk (dried bread) being added to the meat. Mash, meanwhile, refers to the mashed potatoes.  This recipe was a staple at our home in Dublin at Halloween.  It is a very cheap, very traditional supper, and one that truly requires good sausage. Try to use a good quality sausage or perhaps even a bratwurst. Please note that this is a very thin gravy, as is traditional. It will still be very liquidy.",

I would suggest getting the potatoes on the stove first, then brown the sausage, put it in the oven, sautee the onions and start reducing the gravy before mashing the potatoes. Also, it took me at least half an hour to boil the gravy down by half, probably because of the humidity here in Florida. I turned on the A/C to draw some of the moisture out of the air and it seemed to help speed things up. The potatoes seemed a little dry as is, so I tossed in another splash of milk. Adding a splash of beef broth to the potatoes might not be bad, either.",

It's everything I remembered. My change in the timing was to cook the sausage first, then get the onions cooking in the sausage juices while I started the potatoes boiling. Also, to save time on cooking down the gravy, I added 6 cups worth of beef bouillon, but I halved the water and the wine. This made it cook down much faster so that it was ready when the sausages came out of the oven and the potatoes were done. AWESOME RECIPE!!!",

The red wine sauce is absolutely delicious, but as stated it is a thin gravy. I like mine thick and there was no problem to thicken it up. I used a bratwurst and although it was still good, next time I will try a different sausage. Maybe something like Kielbasa, as I think it would compliment the onion gravy nicely. Of course the choice of sausage is down to preference. No complaints about the mash. I love mashed potatoes and I've never tried adding mustard powder. It gave it a nice little kick! I don't really understand the reviews that say this recipe is time consuming. The most time consuming part is the mash, which takes about 20 minutes to make. I just left the gravy on to simmer while the potatoes were boiling. In under 30 minutes, I had a meal on the table. It doesn't seem like much time to me! I served it with fried cabbage, which rounded it out nicely. This is not a fancy meal, but I'm very happy that I tried it. This is one of those heart warming comfort foods which I will definitely make again and again! Thanks for the great recipe wsf!",

I used whipped cauliflower instead of potatoes and butter-flavored pan spray for the mash, but did add the mustard.  Also I used fresh chicken sausage instead of pork.  Even with the changes this came out great.  I can't wait to get skinny and make it the way it's written.  I just returned from England and didn't meet a sausage I didn't like.  Hence the return to the diet.  This was an excellent recipe, thanks for the post.",
