                "reviewBody": "It wasn't bad.. I made my own cake recipe instead of a package of strawberry cake mix and i coloured my cake mixture with a quarter of strawberry jell-o package.. I think it was a good idea if you don't have a strawberry cake mix.. I reduced the amount of the flan mixture into the half because my pan was smaller in size.. One thing that i think was a big mistake following in this recipe is putting the cake pan after the gelatine was cold and set in a boiling water.. It was a disaster the gelatine turned into liquid all over again and so i had to return it into the refrigerator 6 hours again..Or maybe it was my mistake putting boiling water instead of just warm water! So i would recommend to skip this part and just invert the the cake pan normally and just tap hard on the pan edges to loosen it and it would come out just perfect.. Overall the shape of the cake with the three layers was lovely!! This recipe will be a keeper for sure",

If you put the pan in hot water the jello melts really fast so I put it back in the refrigerator until form sets then I flipped it on a serving tray and wet a towel with hot water placed it over the pan and it came out perfect.
