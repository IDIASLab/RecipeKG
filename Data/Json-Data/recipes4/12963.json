By using Bouillon tablets I am able to throw in a vegetable tablet with the chicken broth and it's a nicer flavor then the ready made broth plus the kids get some extra vegetables. I also changed the parsley for Dill Weed which gives the soup an added kick of flavor and for the kids I make smaller matzo balls. But I love the recipe for the matzo balls and find they work out every time!!!",
