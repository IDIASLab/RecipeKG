Console yourself in the process with a nice glass of Shiraz and you won't lament your losses. I've had a yearning for a lentil casserole for weeks perhaps months now. I am a Mum of 3 fussy eaters but I have a very demanding palate with a penchant for herbaceous flavourful spicy dishes from all corners of the globe. So only about once a week do my husband and I get to savour something WE (read \"I\") like. This dish was delicious. I took the advice of many of Allrecipes cook's reviews before me and added: 1 garlic clove (next time blow the expense perhaps 2) chopped carrot (next time another veggie as well) a tin of chopped tomatoes (an essential ingredient!) and I was heavy handed with the cumin and oregano. Hearty filling (but not fattening) wholesome delicious and with lots leftover for heat-up lunches and one-parent dinners. This one is a definite addition to the family cookbook.",

I do not add the zucchini and I use chicken bouillon instead of vegetable. Additionally I add about 4 minced garlic cloves to the sauted onion and I some cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes while the lentils are cooking. I also use italian seasoning instead of the oregano and add a little extra cumin. I also only add about half the amount of bread crumbs to the top. The cheese can be reduced to make it a healthier meal and it still tastes great! With these changes this recipes is my favorite!",

I used lots of old cheddar cheese and I accidentally grabbed curry instead of my cumin and ended up adding them both which was very yummy. I think without the celery mushrooms etc. this dish would of been to bland and plain on the visual palette. I'll make this again with all the stuff I added this time... very yummy.",
