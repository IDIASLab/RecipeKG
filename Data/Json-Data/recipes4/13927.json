I adapted it from a delicious sauce recipe in one of my cookbooks that always drives me wild, and streamlined it so it doesn't take half as long to make. Basically, it's chicken cooked in a spicy tomato cream sauce. Serve with naan and basmati rice.",

I used cream but next time I will use Greek style Yogurt for a creamier texture. Did not have Serrano peppers so used hot Sriracha paste and also used Ghee instead of regular butter. I simmered this for about 30 minutes. Also sauted half an onion. (A note about the ingredients: calls for fenugreek 'leaves' but the directions refer to fenugreek 'seeds'?? I used seeds but did grind them a bit) Will make again.",
