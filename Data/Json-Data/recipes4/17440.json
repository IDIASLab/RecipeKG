After 5 days they were even better! Making more right now, and the only thing I will add this time around is garlic!",

So I used quail eggs not just because they are bite-sized but also because they get penetrated by the brine faster than hen eggs. Therefore after 24 hours they were flavourful and delicious. I made one jar using the Huy Fong Foods Chili Garlic Sauce and one with the regular Sriracha. Both are exquisite. I also used Jan's Homemade Sriracha Salt (on this site) instead of regular salt. These make perfect gifts...if you can bear with giving them away. I found that 18 quail eggs is a good substitute for 12 hen eggs. Thank you for the recipe.",
