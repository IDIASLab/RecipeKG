I also added 2 teaspoons of liquid smoke cuz I was doing mine in a oven...therefore NO charcoal for smoke. I soaked the salmon in the brine for about 36 hours like my dad used to do. I do not have a smoker so I put the salmon on a non stick sprayed baking rack over a foil lined shallow pan. (to catch drips) I smoked the 3/4 inch thick salmon fillets in my outdoor oven (set at about 160 degrees) for seven hours. This produced the best rendition of the old fashioned dry smoked salmon that I grew up eating in the Pacific Northwest. Thanks for posting a terrific recipe!!!",

We opted for two fillets totaling 3.25 lbs (they fit better in the small smoker and we were cooking for a small group so wanted to make sure there was enough fish to go around) and used AllRecipes awesome serving adjuster to help figure out ingredient quantities needed. For us the fish was finished earlier than expected - about 3 hrs of smoking time. My friend was in charge of the actual smoking and temperature-fiddling process with his recently acquired smoker so I don't really know the exacts but I do know that we followed the instructions and temps on the recipe closely.",

I wanted to add that since I kep the large fish whole while cooking I had to cook it longer than the time specified but after 15 minutes had to cover the thinner sections with foil to prevent it from drying out. Also the bourbon & brown sugar and the Old Bay sections were the best in my opinion. I'll be sure to try mesquite next time since this recipe was amazing! Thanks!!",
