Allrecipes omitted a step when they edited my recipe and they suggested I clarify by leaving a comment here.  Make sure to COVER the pot when you simmer the quinoa, otherwise the liquid will evaporate too quickly.  Keep an eye on the pot because milk does have a tendency to boil over. After 20 minutes, there should still be some liquid left in the pot, so you have an oatmeal consistency. You do not want to cook all the liquid out of the quinoa. Feel free to sub any milk you'd like - almond, coconut, cashew, soy, etc! This also makes 2 HUGE portions or 3-4 average portions. Thank you and enjoy! :)",

I did make alterations due to restrictions: almond milk for milk, sugar for maple syrup, and skipped the flax seeds. If you make it my way, it tastes JUST like Froot Loops. Major bonus for a 10 year old boy! He's eating it for breakfast and lunch and snack...need I say more?\nOh, to address comment about bitter taste: yes, rinse it well. And then toast it in pan with butter for 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly, before adding water. (It totally changes flavor of quinoa. Without, all I taste is corn husks - bleh.)",
