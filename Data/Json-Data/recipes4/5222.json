I like white fish and, while not traditional, added chunks of cod fillet to this dish. You want to add the shrimp and fish to the dish with about 10 minutes to go so it does not overcook. Cook uncovered if it is soupy and covered if it is not during these last 10 minutes. Finally, try to find andouille sausage if possible. It makes all the difference.",

I did use brown rice so I had to add another 1/2 cup of broth. I chose to wait and put the sausage back in with the shrimp and I kept it covered the entire time just because the rice I have takes longer to cook. I also added another 1/2 teaspoon of cajun seasoning because I like the heat but other than that I followed the recipe. I really liked that it almost had a creaminess to it and I served it with buttermilk cornbread muffins from this site. Don't let the list of ingredients fool you - this was super easy and didn't take as long as it states. I will definitely make this again Thanks Baron!",

                "reviewBody": "Just a few suggestions to improve the dish a little: You shouldn't need to add a fat to saute the sausage as it already has enough. I prefer a pure pork smoked sausage for this dish but recognize that if you are not in south Louisiana it may be difficult to obtain. Try an independent meat market and you may get lucky. I highly recommend stirring the raw rice in before adding your liquid--stir until every grain is coated with the oil from cooking the meats and seasonings; this will make the rice less sticky in the finished product. It is at this stage I would add in any seafood so that those flavors can mingle before the rice gets completely cooked. (After cooking rice for 25-30 minutes there's no way you will get anything to \"boil\" again as stated in step 8.) Next even \"red\" or Creole jambalaya is not usually this red; I have never heard of using tomato paste in place of tomatoes in jambalaya.",

I always have extra broth available when I make this dish as sometimes I need to add some. Thanks for trying the dish. Baron",

We made it once with kielbasa instead of andouille and it was just as good with a slightly milder but yummy flavor that my small sons appreciated. Thanks for the recipe! (Oh and try with seafood broth instead of chicken broth! Enhances the seafood flavor.)",
