I've never kneaded dough, so I put on some reggae and went to town for the 8 minutes it suggests.  I'm not sure if it was as soft as a horse's nose, but the finished result was beautiful!  I rolled it out with a rolling pin a little larger than the round pan, placed in to the pan, and rolled the edges to match the pan. It turned out just like a delivery pizza!  I brushed it with olive oil and pre-cooked it for 5 minutes, added toppings, and cooked for another 20 min.  Perfect!  Loved this!",
