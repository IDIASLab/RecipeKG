The garlic and oregano simply overwhelmed all the other ingredients with an unpleasant acrid flavor. The acidity that many felt needed to be counteracted with an addition of sugar results from pouring in the wine at the end of the cooking time instead of at the beginning which would allow the alcohol to burn off and a mellow flavor to develop. Eating this was not a pleasant experience. It got fed to my brand new KitchenAid disposer. You could probably turn this into a decent recipe but not without some drastic changes.",

The second time around I added additional sausage extra garlic and used Pinot Grigio because I had no red wine. I also chose to balance the acidity with a bit of sugar. This freezes really well. With my modifications I give this 5 stars! 2011 UPDATE: I've discovered that we prefer this sauce if I use 1 #10 can (you know the really big one) of diced tomatoes in puree to replace all the little ones. Do that and you have no fooling around with the whole tomatoes at the end (hubby who doesn't like big hunks of cooked tomato prefers the diced as well -- no surprises if you miss any!) This is our go-to sauce now!",
