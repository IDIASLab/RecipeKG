I used adobo seasoning and a hamburger grill seasoning I had to replace the steak seasoning since I had none. I also followed the first reviewers advice and did one T of balsamic and one T of rice vinegar. After uncovering and flipping over I only let it cook another minute or two. Another 15 min like instructions said would have overdone mine. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Delish!!",
