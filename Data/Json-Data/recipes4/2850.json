Also I seared the tenderloin in the oil and onions first in a dutch oven. Then I added the other ingredients stirred the juices together and basted them over the pork. Next I baked it covered in the oven. I used fresh rosemary and didn't actually measure anything. It still came out fabulous. We have also used this method to cook boneless pork chops. They weren't as tender but the flavor was still excellent. We served this with sweet potatoes and learned that the broth on top of the sweet potatoes is wonderful. We also want to try it with polenta or grits. This is our new favorite recipe and plan to make it often especially for company.",
