Better than any frozen BBQ chicken pizza you can buy and as good or better than those I've had in restaurants.",

Even our 1-year-old ate a decent amount of it. I actually made two mini pizzas and didn't really follow the quantities specified in the recipe. I just used the amount of sauce peppers onion chicken and cheese that seemed appropriate. The only differences I made were the facts that I didn't have a red onion or monteray jack cheese so I substituted white onion and used mozzarella and cheddar shredded cheese. Quite easy! Thanks!",
