The only problem I had was that it rose too high in the bread maker pan and subsequently sunk in the middle before it was finished. Not a pretty loaf but yummy. Trying to figure out why- perhaps the pan is too small and I should bake it in a larger loaf pan in the oven? Try a little less yeast? In any case it was good enough that I ll try again!",
