I normally don't use recipes for beer or cider from recipes sites like this (usually get them from forums or friends) but I happened across this and liked the combination of ingredients. I just cracked open a bottle now and am very happy with the flavor. It's a nicely rounded beer that if made with a dark extract is very dark and pleasantly \"roasty.\" The hops don't make it as bitter as an India Pale Ale it's just shy of that but the bitterness is just right. It's perfect for a cool fall day here in New England- a good dark and roasty tasting beer. I imagine it would be good too if made to be a lager. Thanks for posting this great recipe!",
