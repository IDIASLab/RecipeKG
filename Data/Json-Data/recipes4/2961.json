I've made this exactly as the recipe instructs with \"good\" results, but the general consensus is \"too rich.\"  I modified the recipe by doing half heavy cream, and half/half.  I used ham steaks, but cook the water out of the cubed ham first, drain.  Then layer the potatoes, ham and cheese.  Double the cheese.  Cook a little longer to ensure the dish isn't runny (almost half hour longer).  The yukon gold potatoes really do work the best.  Enjoy!",

Yukon Gold potatoes, 2 cups sharp cheddar, 2 cups mild cheddar, approx. 1 1/2 lbs. leftover ham, I only had 1 clove of garlic (I used garlic powder also), a medium onion (diced pretty fine), salt and pepper liberally to taste, extra garlic powder (that's how we like it-full of flavor!). Mixed all of it in a big bowl and put in one 9x13 pan and one 5x7 dish. In the larger dish, I put 1 1/4 quarts of heavy whipping cream and 3/4 quart of heavy whipping cream in the smaller dish. I did bake at 350 degrees, but I ended up baking this for an hour and a half (10 minutes longer for the larger dish). I know this review is long, this could really help the cook with 7 or more people to feed! This was not too cheesy, even with all the cheese I used. It was very rich, but so very good!!",
