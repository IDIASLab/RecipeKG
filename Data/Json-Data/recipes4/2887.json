I started using the new spray-on salad dressing (I use the Caesar flavor) as the base in place of the olive oil. Just a few sprays and it's ready for topping. I use the fake crabmeat to cut costs and marinated artichoke hearts cut up to replace the ones packed in water. Sometimes I add sliced red onion and mushrooms if I feel like it. I top it with the reduced fat Italian cheese blend and a little parmesan. Really delish! 6/07/08The whole family really enjoyed this... thanks for a keeper! Great combination of flavors!",
