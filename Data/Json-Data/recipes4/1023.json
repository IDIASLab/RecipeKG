                "reviewBody": "I'm Filipino & this is my favorite dish!  You have to master the soy/ vinegar balance to your taste (sweet, sour, tangy). There are many brands of vinegar (distilled, apple, red wine)& soy sauces (low sodium, black, light)offered with different levels of tartness & saltiness.  If you are lucky to live near a Filipino grocery store, my Lola always recommended \"Native Vinegar (sugarcane) & Soy\" to give it an authentic flavor.  You can also cook chicken (dark)& pork(loin)together for this recipe.  You should marinate it in the refrigerator overnight or 1-2 hrs. prior to cooking. You can also add whole chilis (yellow) place in the side of the pot, not moving or opening them so that it doesn't dominate the dish. Simmer slowly for it to blend.  Don't rush, it won't be as delicious.  It's done when the meats tender.  If you like garlic, take out the meat/sauce from the pot. Saute some oil & garlic pieces & cook in medium heat.  Add the meat & a small amount of sauce back to the pot & saute.  You can also make \"Adobo Fried Rice\".  Transfer the chicken & sauce into a serving dish.  Saute a little oil & garlic.  Add the rice & some of the adobo sauce into the pan & mix thoroughly in high heat.  Vegetarians - you can cook your favorite vegetables like green beans, okra, etc... Chicken Adobo is well loved by all of my foreign friends & it's the most requested dish that I prepare. Enjoy!!!!",

Browning the chicken with onion first makes a huge difference to the flavor. I use 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and 1 cup water. Eliminate the white vinegar and peppercorns.  Add a little salt if needed. You can also substitute fresh garlic with a generous amount of garlic powder or granulated garlic. It's delicious!",

(once you cook it a few times you will get it.) \ni just can't eat it with plain rice... fry garlic till brown and add \"day old rice and a bit of salt\" yummy!",

You may want to reduce the vinegar to 1/2 cup. For extra kick I added onions more garlic and a few whole jalepeno peppers. Overall an excellent recipe! Thanks!",

However being away from the Philippines sometimes makes you forget and measurements are really helpful. I think what this recipe doesn't discuss which is a very important step in making Chicken Adobo is that before you turn on the heat you need to let all of the ingredients sit for an hour. This lets the vinegar cook on its own. That way the dish never turns out vinegar-y. Instead it has this awesome tangy taste. Also if you add pork the flavors are amazing. Chicken is good in itself though if you don't eat pork. Lastly if you can get a hold of \"pandan leaves\" Try stewing a leaf or two with this. Your guests will never be able to get enough.",
