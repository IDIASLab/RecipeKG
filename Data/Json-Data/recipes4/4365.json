To use such words as \"thoroughly uninspired\" and \"sadly lacking\" to describe this dish, is snobbish and in bad taste. If you are going to compare macaroni and hot dogs to an extensive knowledge on Italy and fine Italian cuisine, then please just avoid this site all together. There is no need for such arrogance. I have worked as a chef in many restaurants, preparing elegant dishes daily. Guess what my lunch often consisted of........ HOT DOGS AND MACARONI!! It's delicious. This recipe is good as is. For some palates you may need a little variation but overall I approve. It hits the spot. Buon Appetito!",

My husband was none too pleased, and my children were less than enthused which is a far cry from their usual elation with my Italian cooking. I made this for my family yesterday, and recognized the taste right away as being a recipe I've made before though not from this site The flavor was sadly lacking. While I know that I'm am a tough critic having lived for 3 years in Italy this wasn't even passable to my husband who has only visited there with me. This dish is fine for someone with a bland palate, but if it's flavor you crave then move on to a recipe more original and authentic, LIKE STUPID HOT DOG THING. Wow, what an original and authentic dish that is!",

For starters I followed the recipe exactly as written in order to be able to write a fair review. The consistency was like soup which I did not find very appealing. I was leery because of all the milk but I wanted to try it as written. The taste was o.k. to pleasant but nothing overwhelming. The most important thing that I discovered was the choice of hot dog to add. I used Sabrett all beef because that's what I had but the taste was too strong for this dish. A simple Oscar Mayer with very little flavor would be much better for this recipe. This is a nice dish to make if you have a large group of children to feed etc but I would be inclined to add about another half box of elbow noodles to this and change the consistency. It was just too soupy. Thank you though for posting this. I gave this four stars based on using a less flavorful hot dog. The flavors need to meld together not fight for top billing. UPDATE: I refrigerated the leftovers and reheated them which changed the consistency dramatically. I have included 2 new photos. My rating remains the same.",

The flavor was much better than I expected - and to have something that my step-son enjoyed was nice for a change. We followed the recipe closely to get a good idea of what we thought about it. We did use only 3c milk, and whole wheat pasta, but that was the only changes we made. We cooked the macaroni for only 5min separately then drained & added to the cheese mix to let the pasta finish in the mix and absorb some of that liquid & flavor.  I would suggest using a flavorful tomato sauce to give it more flavor, I think that's why my guys enjoyed it as well as they all seem to love pasta. I would really like to use half the velveeta and 1c shredded cheddar next time and see how that affects the texture. Also I would really love to brown onion, peppers & garlic with the hotdogs. We'll have this again, it is quick and the guys enjoyed it.",

We have a family of 6 and I doubt we will finish a 1/2 batch. You will be eating this until next week. I am VERY glad I halved it. I read the reviews so right off the bat I decided to cook my noodles to slightly harder than al dente and I also reduced the milk by 1/2 cup. I figured I could always add liquids but couldn't take them back out. I also used about 12 ounces of pasta sauce for my half batch....which is slightly less than called for. Once I got everything together I let it simmer and cook for the recommended 5 minutes and I got a great consistency. I was not wowed by the initial taste or the look of this dish. It is kinda...bland. And it just tastes like it is missing something. It is not really tomato-y and not really cheese-y...just sorta....something. We are about to sit down and give it a try and I will let you know what my husband and kids think of it. So...Kids ate the scoop I served them but did not ask for seconds. Husband said it was \"really bland but ok\". He said to give it 2 stars since it wasn't completely gross. It just isn't our cup of tea but we like spicy really flavorful food.",
