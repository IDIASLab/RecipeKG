I made a double batch and plan to freeze some of the mix for another time and am actually looking forward to partially baking them and finishing on a grill. So often we go to b-b-q events and have really tired of settling with salad and frozen veggie burgers. I'll add more jalapeno next time and may add some cumin too. Delicious hot OR cold for sandwiches too! Thanks!",
