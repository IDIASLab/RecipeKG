So if you're low on sprinkles get more before you start lol. I find the cupcakes fill easily but if you want to make it really easy carve out a small section of the center first. The topping will cover the hole. If you aren't into so much chocolate use any combination of cake and pudding flavors to suit. Enjoy.",
