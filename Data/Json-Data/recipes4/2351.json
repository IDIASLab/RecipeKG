Drain, and immerse in a bowl of iced water - heat the butter in the skillet, add the asparagus and and let it heat through. I then add the almonds, and stir. I sprinkle the cheese over the asparagus on the serving plate - this all avoids soggy almonds, over-cooked asparagus, and gluey cheese. Delicious and easy. Thanks!",

The only thing I did different was that after I bolied the asparagus I drained them and then immediately put them in ice water. I laighly sauteed the almonds in butter and then turned the heat down and added the asparagus. I added the cheese after I removed it from the pan to elliminate a big string mess and to make a great presentation. This is a great way to get your kids to eat asparagus and almonds are an excellent source of nutrition!",

I simply steamed the asparagus then dressed it up with the almonds (toasted at 350 degrees for 5 minutes) and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano. Elegant and steps above plain cooked asparagus - five stars.",
