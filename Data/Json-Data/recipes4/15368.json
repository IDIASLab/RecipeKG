Everyone in the family enjoyed this dish. However I don't see why you wouldn't saute the onions and peppers and then add in the sausage to cook all at once. I did this and it saved steps and time. Also I used 16 oz of tomato sauce instead of 15 and it was a perfect consistency. So for those who thought it was dry maybe just a little more sauce is all you need.

I made two small changes regarding the ingredients: First I had some hot sausage and hamburger mix that was leftover from some chili I made so I used that instead of straight sausage. Second I had some fresh sage for a soup recipe I am going to make so I used that instead of the dried- I just added it in at the end of cooking the onion/pepper mix. Other than that I followed the ingredients exactly. Regarding the directions- I had some bacon already cooked from a previous recipe so I didn't have the reserved bacon fat to brown the meat in. Otherwise I followed the directions. This was quick and easy to make (especially so since the bacon part was done ahead!) and the whole family loved it! It probably could have been cooked slightly less than a hour as it was just a tad dry but really not enough to be noticeable. I can't wait to give a copy of this recipe to my mom- my dad will LOVE this! Thanks Cliff G- this will be going into my regular rotation. Perfect comfort food for the chilly winter months:)",
