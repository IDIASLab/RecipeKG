The level of desired spicyiness will vary for different people.  Canned green chili is too mild for my taste.  For those who prefer spicier green chili, I recommend www.buenofoods.com - a popular New Mexico chili retailer.  You can also choose to make a milder stew and serve extra green chili on the side so people can adjust the spicyness.  I highly recommend you try this stew - it will warm your bones on a cold winter's day.  YUM!",

I would reccommend using about a cup of water instead. I did not use the cucim but that was because I don't care for it. I chopped two small jalapeno's and browned them with the onion and meat. I DID NOT add the potatoes. Instead of using the canned chili's I chopped fresh about one dozen. After browing the meat and onions and jalapeno's I mixed everything in the crockpot on low for as long as I needed. It is a very good recipe! Thanks Lynn!",

I did make mine with ground beef rather than beef stew meat or pork and used fresh roasted green chili (living in NM has it's advantages when it comes to getting authentic ingredients for this one!) that I purchased from Sunflower Market. A little tweaking of the spices to suit my personal tastes - I like a lot of garlic - fresh tortillas from a local establishment and we were in total green chili bliss! Suffice it to say I won't really need to be buying from local restaurants as I have found something just as good, if not better! Thanks for posting a great recipe :)",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great basic recipe but it's missing a few ingredients that would make it traditional, \"New Mexican Green Chili Stew.\" I say, \"New Mexican,\" since few Mexicans cook soley with fresh green chili's. [they wait for them to ripen for preservation purposes & use primarily red] But after they migrated to the US, this Green Chili Stew became more of a necessary adaptation due to income restrictions. This stew was actually created when Hispanics with large families &  limited incomes worked in the Hatch, NM chili fields. Instead of pork or prime cuts of beef, they used hamburger meat though pork shoulder was definitely preferred. [trust me when I say ground cumin & pork go together like helpless women and railroad tracks] Anyway, the more traditional version presents 2 + lbs Hatch Green Chili's, chopped jalape\u00f1os, potatoes, hearty amounts of white onions & celery stalks with leaves, loads of cilantro & cumin, (2 + tbs cumin) parsley, generous amounts of garlic, green/red tomatoes, cayenne and black pepper, red pepper flakes, salt, Mexican Oregeno, bay leaves, Italian seasoning & beef/chicken/vegetable/or pork broth & was always served with warm tortillas. Notice that all ingredients were very easy to come by & cheap for Hispanic workers. If pork was used, they would season flour the meat & brown with garden vegetables then place in pot & simmer until the pork fell apart. This method also made for a thicker stew. Either way, it's a delicious stew & great recipe Lynn!",
