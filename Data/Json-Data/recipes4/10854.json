My 4 yr old gobbled it up, as is...but my husband and I did not enjoy it.  It is an easy recipe.  When I first found this, I was looking for some sort of beans and rice recipe that was not like black beans and rice (something different?).  Without the adobo, it's like spaghetti sauce with beans and we liked it quite a bit.  By the way, I did drain and rinse my beans.",
