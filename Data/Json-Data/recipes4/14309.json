I really think the veggies would have been very skimpy had I followed the recipe. I tasted the vegetable mixture before putting it in the dish to bake. It had no flavor so I added garlic salt basil oregano parsley and poultry seasoning - just a few shakes of each. That really helped this recipe. The pros of this dish - I liked using the cornstarch and milk as opposed to a cream of soup and I enjoyed the different flavor of the cornbread topping as opposed to a pie crust. It was easy to put together.",
