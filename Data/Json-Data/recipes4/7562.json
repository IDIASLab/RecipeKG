Here's how I made mine:\nUsed a food processor or blender to grind up the oatmeal and chocolate chips in to a powder. Pour this mixture in to a bowl, stir in the flax until well mixed. Then add in your pb (I used creamy)and vanilla. Heat the honey for about 10sec so that it is thinner, then add to the bowl. Stir until well combined. Put in to fridge for 10-30mins, use a 1/2 tbsp measuring spoon to dish out the dough (can be rounded scoops or exact, doesn't matter). This made me about 30, 1inch bites. Put in the freezer to enjoy later!",
