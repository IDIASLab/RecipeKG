I served this on a platter and put the cheese down the middle of the dish (my kids can be picky about parm). All in in all it was really good - I recommend using different rices for texture and flavor. Thanks for the recipe!",

I loved the Parmesan in mine but in consideration of Parmesan Hating Hubs I left it out of his portion so he wouldn t whine.
