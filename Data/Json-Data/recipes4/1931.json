The South Carolina style of barbecue sauce is traditionally a mustard-based sauce. Eastern North Carolina and Middle Tennessee tend to have vinegar-based sauces. This is a great South Carolina-style sauce particularly for a low-carb version. As with most barbecue sauces from the South the classic use is with pulled pork.",

I altered slightly:\n\nI used EZ-Sweet liquid sucralose, because \"granulated Splenda\"has net carbs while pure sucralose does not. \nI added a tsp of both onion and garlic powder.\nI only used 1 Tbsp of chili powder, and replaced the other Tbsp with chipotle powder.\nI hate liquid smoke, so instead I put the sauce in a shallow cake pan and smoked it for 2 hours, stirring every 30 minutes. \n\nIt came out delicious, and made a believer of mustard base, out of 8 people. Happy cooking!\n\nPS If you wondering what's next to the sauce in the photo, it's sea salt that I'm smoking also.",

I added 1/4 cup water 1 small can of tomato paste and a TBSP of paprika. It is still tangy and strong and you can still taste the strong mustard influence.
