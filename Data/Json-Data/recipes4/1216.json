In my mind I pictured an actual burger topped with pizza fixings instead of a sloppy joe style but regardless it was tasty simple and quick for the night I didn't have much time to work with. I am having to cut back on cheese for health reasons so I used a little bit of shredded instead of a whole slice. I also added a few mushrooms because we love them on our pizza. I think next time I make it I'll add some onion and pepperoni to the beef mixture to give it more kick. This is one you can easily add your favorite pizza toppings to give it variety.",
