Since I didn't use the called-for cheese, this dish became all about the breadcrumbs. I actually used some very intensely flavored garlic herb flatbread cracker crumbs. The combination of crisp toasted crumbs with the sweet-sour bacon dressing and the fresh beans was absolutely addictive. I only used about 1/4 cup water and quickly stir fried at high heat. These cooked up perfectly in about seven minutes. I will make these often.",

I will probably use slightly less bacon next time to lighten it a tad (there was a pretty good amount of grease at the bottom after cooking was finished and it all cooled). I cut the cheese by half and used Parmesan and I'm glad I did. The Italian blend at the amount called for would have really overpowered the green beans in my opinion. But don't skip the balsamic vinegar! It smells very strong at first but cooks beautifully with the flavors of everything else! My husband was upset that I added it because it stunk up the whole kitchen at first but he raved about how excellent the final product was! With a few minor changes this is a 5-star recipe and definitely one I will come back to again and again!",

Later I added a few crumbled pieces of micro bacon. The beans were no way near done at the cooking time suggested. I cooked them 15 min more min and they were still a little hard. Maybe because they were not fully submerged in water? The next time I will either steam or boil the beans separately and add to the sauce. I also used Ritz crackers that I added a little melted butter and garlic to and toasted briefly in a small frying pan. Topped the beans with that and parmesan cheese.
