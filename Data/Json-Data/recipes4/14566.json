The only real change I made was to leave out the bbq sauce and we each put our own on our plates. The cilantro was a nice fresh touch also! My legally-bound-by-marriage food guinea pig is sometimes skeptical about my food experiments but this was met with hearty and resounding \"This is pretty good.\" (And no sense of surprise in his voice.) He mentioned that it might be fun to put the filling in tortillas or even pair it with eggs for a fun brunch dish. I thought about adding mushrooms but I forgot. Oh dang. Guess I'll just have to add them the next few times I make this:) Thanks for a great recipe. This one is actually going in the \"make again\" file because 1. It's easy. 2. It's pretty tasty and 3. Did I mention it's good AND easy?",

                "reviewBody": "The 5 star rating is because my husband is raving about this one. Our small town grocer did not have andouille sausage so I used hot Italian sausage (which is really more flavor than heat). I \"picked\" the chicken meat off a rotisserie chicken the night before so this was pretty easy to make if you're a quick chopper. I did back the BBQ sauce down to just 2 cups (16 oz.). Choose your BBQ sauce wisely as this will heavily impact flavor. We used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce which worked well. I did forget to buy the fresh cilantro but it was still very good. Served with plain mashed potatoes to balance the intense flavors of this dish. We plan to serve leftovers as a filling in some Cuban bread brought by a friend from Florida who pays the \"Cuban Bread Toll\" when she visits. UPDATE: Have made this successfully several times to my family's delight. However the last time it was not up to par. Here's what went wrong as a cautionary tale: I used boiled chicken rather than rotisserie chicken so the chicken sort of disintegrated. Also purchased honey flavored Sweet Baby Rays by mistake instead of original Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce which made a surprisingly unhappy difference.",
