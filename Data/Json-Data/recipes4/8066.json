I used frozen broccoli but I cooked in microwave and then let it drain in a strainer and then dry on paper towels to get the water out.  I used light cream instead of heavy to save on calories.  And I added panko bread crumbs on top - just a personal thing with crunch.  Otherwise, I made as directed and it was fabulous!  To the reviewer who said this was too salty, please note the recipe said \"salt to taste.\"  I'll definitely make this again - the wine was perfect in the sauce.  And thank you for a recipe that didn't include canned soup!!!!",

I chose this recipe post Turkey Day simply because I had all the ingredients in house. I thought it would be a little too rich, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was rich, as one would assume looking at the ingredients, but not overly so. The little bit of wine really helped elevate the flavor. I think this recipe will be a \"go to\" for all our Thanksgiving leftover needs. It's a keeper!",

It was not soupy at all. Rich thick and delicious! The wine and the cream made this sauce special. This is a winner!",

I used fresh broccoli and evaporated milk because it was all we had. I sauteed some onions & minced garlic in the butter with a pinch of crushed Tyme and a splash of the wine before adding the flour. This was served over rotini. I must say it was refreshing to make the siauce from scratch rather than dump in salty cans of soup! This recipe is simple quick comfort food.
