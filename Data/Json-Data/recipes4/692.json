Throw it all in the crock pot and a few hours later we had a nice dinner.  I served it over rice one night, had a few leftovers that I served over small shell pasta for lunch later.

I used pearl onions instead and fresh mushrooms and omitted the wine.  I read other reviews about concerns over bland chicken, to fix that I browned my seasoned frozen chicken breasts over high heat and then added them to cook in the crock pot, it worked perfectly and I think it wouldn't have been as good without doing that.  Served it over egg noodles with French bread.  It was really yummy and a great concept.  Thanks!   ***UPDATE*** I finally managed to remember white wine at the store and it makes quite a bit of difference in the flavor.  It's a pretty heavy sauce and the addition of the white wine gives it an almost crisp feeling in my mouth.  It's a subtle difference and I noticed but my hubby didn't.",

When the chicken (boneless skinless chicken thighs because they are cheaper) was done cooking (I left it in for about 6 hours alternating high and low on the cooker) I took it out and placed it in a dish and then added a little flour to the pot making a really nice gravy.

I put chicken in a bag and added garlic powder dried thyme and EVOO. Mixed until well coated. In a fry pan I heated EVOO and then did a quick brown on the chicken. Removed chicken and put in lined crock pot. I put a sliced sweet onion and fresh mushrooms in the same hot fry pan and deglazed the pan with wine. I added cream of celery and chicken and rice soups to the mushroom mixture. (It was all I had) Simmered for short time to mix well. I poured mixture over chicken in crock pot. It cooked on low for aprox. 2 hours and I served it over rice with a side salad. I could tell you how good it was but the empty crock pot does all the talking. YUM!",
