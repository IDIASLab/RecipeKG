My grandchildren were thrilled to wake up Saturday morning with this amazing smell wafting through the house. I would think many different cake mixes, fruits, and puddings could be substituted...mmmmmm pumpkin added instead of bananas.  It could be endless depending on one's imagination.",

Another recipe on this site calls for banana pudding instead of vanilla pudding. That might give it more banana flavor. This recipe was moist but I still prefer the flavor of traditional banana bread. I like to add spices to my banana breads-cinnamon nutmeg ginger but I didn't try that with this recipe I wasn't sure how it would turn out with the cake mix. Overall a good recipe when you want to make a quick loaf of banana bread.",
