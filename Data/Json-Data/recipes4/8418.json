I figured I could make my own to make do, since I can't buy any in my area. It doesn't matter. It's a hundred times better when you make your own. I would like to leave a tip: when spreading it out on the baking sheet, really spread it out. I made a patty-like sheet and the edges almost burned and the middle was still slightly, ever-so-slightly, gooey. So, the three hours is perfect but you might get a better result if you don't clump it all together. I'm hooked on this stuff. Next, I'm trying the hotter garlic sauce from Huy Fong Foods. Thanks a million WFDM!",
