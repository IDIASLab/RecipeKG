I  skipped the step coating chicken in butter and peppercorns and just put the plain chicken on top of the onions.  I followed all other directions as given.   It was flavorful and comforting - didn't miss the butter or peppercorns at all.  I recommend baking at 350 rather than 325 and uncovering the last 10 minutes to let the stuffing get a little crispy.  At 325 I had to bake longer than directed.",

However, for a nice crusty top, i think an extra 20 minutes (80 total)  would have been best.",
