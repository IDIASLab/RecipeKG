        "description": "The secret to pho, the deeply fragrant Vietnamese noodle soup with meat and flavorful toppings, is all in the stock. Nothing makes a better stock than a pressure cooker. Fairly quickly, a pressure cooker brings together all the flavors of meat bones, aromatics, and, in this case, fish sauce and toasted spices, to make a heady broth. With an Instant Pot&reg;, you can boil the bones, saute the aromatics, and finish the dish with 1 pot. To serve, put small bowls containing thinly sliced onion, bean sprouts, limes, and Thai basil on the table. Give your people each a bowl of pho and let them top the soup as they wish.",

I cut up pickeled garlic as well since this gives it a little bit of a punch a few sprigs of the cilantro stalk with the leaf and 2 full onions into the pot while it cooks. I most certainly added oyster sauce after it cooked and lots of fresh Thai chilies as well as sriracha. The meat i used was beef ribs and shank and it was so tender I could not believe the time it took was short compared to the hours i spent in the past making broth. Overall it was pretty good but you always have to modify to your taste and liking.",

I used a pho spice packet of cardamom cinnamon star anise coriander seeds cloves ( 1.99 at the Asian market). I omitted the beef bones step entirely and used a couple of beef pho broth cubes ( 0.99 for a pack of four). The rest of the recipe I kept the same. This recipe was so fast and easy to make. The pho turned out to be very flavorful and my family loved it! I m going to try it with beef shank or short ribs next time.",
