                "reviewBody": "First of call thank you to the 1 300 plus members who have saved this recipe and for those who have taken the time to recreate and review. Here is a bit of clarifying information re some differences between curry 'paste' which my recipe calls for and curry 'powder'. I created this very simple recipe using Yellow Curry Paste. The brand name I prefer is Mae Ploy a well-known Thai brand. Here is the ingredients list: Garlic lemongrass shot dried red chile salt galanga cumin cinnamon star anise tumeric kaffir lime peep and coriander seed. On the other hand a typical curry powder McCormick's is the most widely used one here in the U.S. contains: Coriander fenugreek tumeric cumin black pepper bay leaves celery seed nutmeg cloves onion redd pepper and ginger. Very different products and like apples to oranges when comparing the 'right' amount to use. McCormick suggests 2 teaspoons for a standard 4 serving recipe as a jumping off point however this particular recipe was not formulated using the quite different tasting powder. Call it a pet peeve but I will never down-rate a recipe as being 'too mild' or 'too plain' or 'not enough flavor/heat etc' when substitutions have been made as in the case of paste vs powder. Yogurt is a great sub for the sour cream and I have made it with both regular and lowfat sour cream as well as lowfat plain (regular and Greek) yogurt and found it quite good. Hopefully this claification will be of help!",

People who are substituting curry powder -- it is probably tasty in its own way but curry powder isn't substitutable for curry paste. It's a different beast really. Please don't rate this recipe low if you substitute curry powder and it doesn't work for you. I think the recipe's pretty forgiving though. If you mix the spice with the sour cream and it tastes good at that point it will probably make tasty fish. If it tastes bland at that point add more spice!
