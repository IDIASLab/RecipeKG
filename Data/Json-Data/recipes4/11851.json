First of all, I had a head of cabbage left over so I cut that up and sauteed it with olive oil, 1 chopped onion and 3 cloves of garlic, minced.  I used 2 lbs. ground chuck which I browned and drained.  Then I made 2 c. of white rice in a large stock pot.  Added the cabbage mixture, ground beef, 2 cans of soup, 1 can water, and 1 can of tomato sauce with the herbs and such already in there. and 1 envelope of dried onion soup mix.  I mixed it all together and let the cabbage soften a little more with the lid on.  It DISAPPEARED!  My husband and brother added a few dashes of hot sauce to theirs.  Definitely a winner and much, much easier than traditional cabbage rolls.",
