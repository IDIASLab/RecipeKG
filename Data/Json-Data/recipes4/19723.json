Just be sure to undercook your pasta by at least a minute, since it'll finish cooking in hot sauce for a few more minutes. This is a critical step, and allows all those flavors to get sucked up by the still hydrating spaghetti. Garnish with a little more Pecorino Romano cheese and basil.",

So the second time I made it, I started with 2x 24 ounce jars of sauce and just 3 Cups of water.  Gosh it is tasty.  I highly recommend this.",
