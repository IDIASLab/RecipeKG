Concentrate refers to the way it is made. The fruit is put into a huge maceration chamber where several bags of granulated sugar are added to the fruit and left there for sometimes months at a time. The reason why this is done is so that these companies can offer the product year round. Bacteria and other pathogens will not grow in sugar so they're able to pile on crop after crop of fruit without a loss. So don't think there is no sugar in this recipe. There is some.",
