I pealed the cuke, sliced, then salted it and placed it in a bowl with a dish covering the slices.  I then place a heavy object on the dish to press the cucumbers.  You can leave it for an hour, or overnight in the refrigerator.  This releases the juice and really brings out the flavor and crunch of the cucumbers.  Since I'd already salted the cucumbers, I didn't add any more salt.  This tasted just like a low fat version of Greek Gyros.\r\n",
