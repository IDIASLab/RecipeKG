It's easy to prepare and always a crowd pleaser. Traditionally this dish only uses only onions, potatoes and egg; however I like to add a little green, either parsley or chives depending on your taste. They're both wonderful.",

I also didn't remove my cooked potatoes and onions to another dish to mix with the eggs; instead I poured the egg mixture right into the skillet, then lifted and tilted to get the egg smoothed around evenly. I just didn't see the point in dirtying up another bowl :) The instructions are partly missing a step: Once the eggs are in the skillet, you must cook it til the eggs are soft-set on the stovetop before finishing it off in the oven. Or just plan to bake it longer in the oven :) Thank you for the recipe, I think that with a heavy dose of garlic this would be 5-star!",

However at the bottom it states to bake in the oven for 5 minutes. At the top it states 25 minutes which is much better. I still took it out of the oven flipped it on a plate and returned it to the skillet for a few more minutes. My husband is from Spain and loves this dish but the traditional way uses more oil and takes longer so thanks; I'll make it more often now.",

Keep the potatoes sliced thin & do the same with the onion. Fry both in a large omelet pan with olive oil until golden brown. Beat eggs separately, without any milk or oil. Once items in the pan are ready, pour the eggs directly on top, making sure it's not too thick. Season the tortilla before the eggs set.Cook until eggs are fairly well set, then carefully flip the tortilla & cook the other side. Should be thin once done & extremely delicious!

I did make a few adjustments....I used red potatoes instead (which I believe cook faster) and I used Old Bay seasoning) (my favorite in place of the smoked paprika salt and pepper. I used a small white onion instead of a sweet one and I used dill instead of parsley. Finally I made sure that the bottom of the eggs were brown before putting it in the oven for about 6 minutes.
