Brush the BBQ sauce on the chicken\r\nI used 2 cups of flower.  1 cup of milk, \u00bd cup of water and 2 eggs.  DO not use all that salt.  I sprinkled some garlic salt in the wet mix and also some mesquite seasonings. I do not like pepper much but put a little in the wet mix. \r\n I put chopped garlic in the dry mix.  I double dipped and fried.   This is the key\u2026  Butter the bottom of a baking dish.  Brush each strip both sides with BBQ sauce \u201cgenerously\u201d.  Lay flat on the dish, not on top of each other.  \r\n\r\nBake the sauce into the strips.  Then I put the broiler on and left them in there a little while.  They came out crispy and tasty.  Reminded me of the boneless chicken crisps at KFC.  Served with crispy cheese baby green beans and macaroni.  Big hit in my home, and I\u2019m a pretty good cook my family is spoiled. And they loved this recipe will make again and again.  \r\n",

I looked at the reviews after I made this. And it was soo pungent with salt it was really not good. There was salt in the liquids and salt in the flour mixture not to mention salt in the dry mesquite. Not to mention a bit to much pepper as well. I kept thinking maybe I'm just thinking about this all wrong. Until I made the 1st batch and it was a total waste. The salt and pepper really was an over kill. I'm sorry. I made a 2nd batch and omited salt and pepper out of the liquid and reduced the water to 1/2 cup and increased the milk to 3/4 cup. On the flour mixture I decreased the salt to a couple of tablespoons. And left everything else the same. If your going to self-rising flour....totally omit all salt out of this recipe. Will not be making this recipe ever again. I'm sorry.",

I cut down flour to 2 cups and used 1 egg and scaled down the rest of the ingredients. I think I used too much salt. One tablesoon in egg mix and about 1/8 cup in flour. I will cut that back next time. I didn't use smoke flavoring. I fried in 12 inch skillet with about 1/4 cup oil. They came out crispy and tender. I will make again!Thanks Jenny!",

The mesquite seasoning was definitely unappealing to me...just added a very strong artificial tasting, smoky flavoring that I will surely omit completely should I attempt this recipe again. We used less flour and salt because we had less chicken. The chicken turned out pretty soggy following the recipe, so I'd also modify the way it's fried / baked should I do it again. Perhaps just baking it instead of frying in oil. Would be decent if it turned out crispier and without using any of the mesquite seasoning whatsoever.",
