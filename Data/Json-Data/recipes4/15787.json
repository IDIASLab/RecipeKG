However, I'll probably try this in the oven next time--I just prefer oven baked bread.  Still, this rose perfectly and baked very well in the bread machine, so it's a great bread for a bread machine.  I did modify it slightly and used 1/2 orange juice in place of the water.  Delish!  Also, a note for anyone using their bread machine for the first or second time . . .if you have a fruit/nut beep, wait to add the craisins until you hear the beep.  It works well that way.  Thanks for the recipe!",

The cranberries chewy and adding a nice tang.  Both my husband and I really enjoyed it.  I plan to make it for work this week and for Christmas morning.  Thanks for the recipe!",

Used bread flour subbed o.j. for the water and the zest of 1 orange for the oil (not gonna go out and get orange oil just for this) the orange flavor came out very nicely. I think leftovers would have made a lovely and unique bread pudding. But my irritation to my family not eating this loaf led me to just toss it. It was good though not very sweet and perfect for toast with jam or to make French toast.",

I also didn't have yogurt so I soured 3/4 C. milk with 1 TB of vinegar. I ALSO didn't have any honey so I used molasses instead. I threw everything in the bread machine at the beginning as directed and it was fantastic. It smells wonderful and tastes great. I will definitely be making this again!",
