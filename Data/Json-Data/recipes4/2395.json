They were very decadent and the flavor was just perfect (although they needed additional salt at the table in spite of what I thought was plenty before cooking). I made them at home in the oven using a glass baking dish. I set the oven higher to 450 degrees and left the baking time the same. I also added a little olive oil before the butter. Often I've searched so hard for something different to serve as a vegetable and I've always overlooked the simple onion! Thank you Riverview5950 for sharing this recipe!:-)",
