I did end up adding 1/2 tsp garlic powder, a tsp of mustard, 1/2 tsp paprika, and black pepper to the sauce, as well as using fresh mushrooms and doubling the sour cream.

There were no leftovers which is saying something since my family is made up of picky eaters, who all like something different. Thank you for sharing a new family favorite.",

I used all beef (it was in the freezer and I didn't want to go out); I didn't use the cinnamon but used cardamon instead. For some reason I have two open bottles of cardamon and saw that it was used in another recipe from another site instead of cinnamon and as my cinnamon is running low I used that. The sauce I really did differently but followed the main directions. I used the mushrooms added some onions did the beef broth added a can of cream of mushroom soup did the cornstarch doubled the sour cream added a touch of lemon juice some cardamon a touch of a1 sauce and parsley and a shake of paprika. As I said I taste tested and it is good sitting in the oven at 225 will have it over noodles and brussels sprouts. I probably read 40 recipes and would have changed other recipes much more than I changed yours. I have yet to meet a recipe that I haven't changed in some way. I can't resist. Thank you for your recipe. I have saved it and I'm sure we will enjoy it again and again.",
