One evening I had the urge to bake something, so I improvised with the ingredients at hand.  My family and I have been hooked ever since.  As well as tasting great, this recipe is incredibly quick and easy, because it's heated on a stovetop, rather than in the oven.",

This is my recipe, and I can see why it didn't turn out so well for you-- the website administrators didn't get it quite right (they edited my recipe slightly).  You're absolutely correct-- 2 tablespoons of water is not nearly enough.  The trick is to keep adding water until it holds firmly together, but is not overly sticky.  Furthermore, 3 or 4 minutes a side is probably too much-- 1-2 minutes per side is more like it, although it  depends on how thick you make each one.  I hope this helps you enjoy it more, although it's probably a matter of personal taste more than anything else.  Happy cooking!",
