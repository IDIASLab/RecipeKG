He used a slightly smaller pan than called for and sliced, rather than cubed the potatoes, but beyond that he strictly stuck to the recipe. We both were really impressed and cleaned these up like nobody's business.  So much better, in my view, than the au gratin potatoes with the cheese mixed in with the sauce (the very popular \"Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes,\" also from this site, comes to mind). He didn't measure the cheese, just sprinkled it over the top till it looked just right.  The cheese melts and forms a delicious crust over the rich, creamy potatoes.  The garlic was just enough to add a little flavor dimension and interest.  The fact that it wasn't necessary to cook the sauce on the stove-top first was an added bonus. He served these with a perfectly prepared prime rib roast, steamed broccoli and \"Brussels Sprouts with Green Peppers,\" also from this site.  It couldn't have been a better dinner.",
