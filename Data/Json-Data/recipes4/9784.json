I didn't add any chili powder because I didn't want it to taste exactly like chili \"broth.\" It was okay; I enjoyed it. After tasting I felt the need to add more hot sauce. At the amount called for in the recipe I couldn't discern any hot sauce flavor at all. I added another five or six shakes of hot sauce. Spiced up this is a somewhat tasty (and healthy) recipe. As written it is somewhat ordinary. Because this is healthy easy to prepare and tasty I will have it again.",
