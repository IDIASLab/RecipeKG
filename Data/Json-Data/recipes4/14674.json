I used red bell pepper instead of green (personal preferance) beef broth instead of water and I did not add the full amounts of pepper/salt. I just added them to taste. This was a VERY thick and flavorful chili (that really does seem to improve even more the longer it sits--honest!) and this was quick for me to make and portion out for work lunches. NOTE: The recipe did not specify wether to rinse the beans and tomatoes. I did. Also the mild chili powder I used was california ground chili powder. It's got all the flavor of chili powder with half the heat.",

Long story short I won the Chili cookoff after 10 years of failed attempts. The judges loved the taste and how the roast shredded.",
