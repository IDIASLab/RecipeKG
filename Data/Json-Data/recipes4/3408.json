I really enjoyed these thanks for rating my salad (: Update: I used the leftover filling to make a type of stuffing with shrimp on top and mozzerella cheese I stuck under the broiler until the cheese was bubbly and a little brown---now that was amazing! Thanks for the fantastic recipe didn't help with my diet but I really enjoyed! Orginal review: These were very flavorful! I subbed minced-up shrimp for the clams I also like other reviewer's suggestion of using sausage I think that would be really good. My 4 year old came in from outside and said the house smelled like pizza and he was wondering where the pizza was LOL. I didn't use quite as much Italian seasoning as called for and I scaled the recipe to 5 mushrooms just to try it and had enough filling for 7 or 8. So I had quite a bit of stuffing leftover this makes alot of stuffing mixture. Thanks for the post!",

The italian seasoning along with the italian breadcrumbs really overpowered the taste.. Next time I'll just use plain breadcrumbs less italian seasoning and a little more parmesan cheese to the recipe.
