To make things easier on myself I just chopped the sun dried tomatoes in the food processor with the rest of the ingredients that needed mixed with it. Takes a few pulses and voila! mixed together and chopped sun dried tomatoes all at the same time. I used the jarred sun dried tomatoes in oil for this recipe as it didn't say one way or the other. Worked perfectly. At the written time and temp it got pretty dark; I probably should've checked on it but it really didn't affect the taste at all. Still very wonderful. Thanks for the recipe! We will make it again.",

Baked at 350F for 50 minutes in a French White quiche dish let it set for 10 minutes. Used mild sausage; it was very good.",

I think the sun dried tomatoes could be reduced. I added my signature ingredients of spinach and cayenne pepper. It was great and cooked perfectly after 50 minutes I did tent with foil for half an hour. I also chose colby jack cheese instead of mozzarella and used 2 boneless chicken thighs in place of the sausage at the request of my boyfriend. Tasted good but would love to try again with the sausage. Will continue to use this recipe as a base and switch up the meats and cheeses! Would be nice for brunch or breakfast with bacon.",
