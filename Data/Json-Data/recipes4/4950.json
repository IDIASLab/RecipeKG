For the marinade I used olive oil vs. veg. oil cut the amount of black pepper in half and added 1/4 tsp. of chili powder along with a bit of minced garlic. I used sirloin vs. flank steak and let it marinate in the ziploc bag all day. This would work equally well with chicken. Since this was a \"Ranch-Style\" marinade I felt it would lend itself nicely to a wrap and nothing pairs better with ranch than bacon right? So instead of grilling the onion and pepper I fried up some bacon and gave these a BLT twist. I assembled these with some Colby-Jack cheese fresh crisp lettuce tomatoes and bacon - DH was in heaven. These were great with all the traditional fajita sides - fresh salsa guacamole and of course sour cream!",

I also added a small squeeze of honey (maybe 1/2 TBSP) to the marinade just to give it a little sweetness. I'm excited to try this agin when it marinates for the full 6 hours!",
