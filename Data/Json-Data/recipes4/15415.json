                "reviewBody": "These have potential but there seems to be some missing steps in the recipe. If you pour all of your mix into one bowl you will end up with one gigantic spider instead of \"spiders\" which is okay but I recommended separating your mix out into different sized bowls so you will end up with several different sizes. Also when the mix goes into the fridge is is all liquid at that point. To put the pieces of straws in there at that time would be pointless. They would never stay in place put just float to to the top with no rhyme or reason. The straws \"legs\" need placed on the spider after it is set and onto the serving platter. On that note there is no way to get jello to look like a spider while it is inside the bowl it was set up in. You must turn it over and get it onto a platter so that it is flat side down and you can stick the legs and eyes on. To do this you will need to set your bowl/bowls of jello into a bigger bowl of hot water for 10-15 seconds or until it starts to loosen around the edge. At that point you can put your serving platter face down over your jello bowl and invert it onto the platter. This is definitely something the kiddo's would love on Halloween. I used the straw pieces but I think pipe cleaners would work better. With pipe cleaners you could get that bend in the spiders legs.",
