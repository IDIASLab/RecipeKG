While most potatoes kugels include this step, one of this recipe's secrets is that you keep the moisture in - it makes for an exceptionally moist kugel. So leave it all in, even it the mixture looks watery. ",

Tasted it as soon as it came out of the oven & it was TDF, with a very crispy brown top and a creamy inside. Had to go to another room before I would eat it all. Thanks so much for sharing.",

One trick she had that I do know is to broil the kugel for 5 to 7 minutes before baking.  I broil it with the plan close to the broiler element, then lower the heat and move the pan down to the middle rack.  Give a beautiful top and bottom crust with a creamy inside.",

In the REFRIGERATED section of the supermarket I bought 2 bags of Crystal Farms Simply Potatoes, Shredded Hash Browns (no excess water, no excess work). Used a very large Spanish Onion and I used peanut oil in lieu of vegetable oil. Because a 9x13 pan would have made too much for just me and my husband, I used 2 disposable alumiminum 9\" round pans greased very well with the p. oil. One for now & one for later. Grated onion in food processor then added eggs (beaten)oil, salt, pepper and one bag of potatoes. Pulsed 'till mixed NOT OVERMIXED. Transfered to a large bowl & added 2nd bag of potatoes as is, mixed by hand until all ingredients incorporated. Divided in the two pans.Fluffed top with a fork so shredded potatoes could crisp up.  Placed on cookie sheet. Placed in preheated 400 degree oven for 30 minutes, then lowered to 350 for 1 hour until nicely browned and crisp on top. May need additional 20-30 minutes depending on your oven. My husband couldn't wait to eat it because it smelled fabulous while baking.  He ate it hot out of the oven.  Tasted better to me when cooled.  Crisp on top and softer in the middle.  REALLY DELICIOUS and so very easy to prepare.  I have no alternative to suggest if you can't find the refrigerated shredded potatoes except to do it from scratch.",

I made one kugel exactly per the recipe and a second with the addition of one third cup of matzo meal, both were excellent wit the second being a tad drier.  The drier version worked well with brisket and the creamier version was perfect on its own.  Thanks for a great trip down memory lane.  Bravo!",
