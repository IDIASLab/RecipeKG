I spread the pieces onto parchment paper on a baking sheet and baked them for 10 minutes at 350. I pulled the pan out, flipped them over, added the cheese, and then baked for another 4-5 minutes.  They came out great! YUM! I think I will make them again tonight because I still have plenty of kale leftover!",

The kale was prewashed and cut into small pieces. All I had to do was tear off a few stems here and there and spread the kale out onto the sprayed baking sheets. Then I sprayed the kale with cooking spray and sprinkled with seasoned salt and garlic powder before topping the kale with cheese. I had a cheddar/jack mix. I took it from the oven too soon thinking it was going to burn; but I put it back in because it was not crisp. After the ten minutes I took it out and it was crisp and delicious! Make sure to bake long enough to make it crispy and you will like it.",

I couldn't really follow amounts and don't know what a bunch of kale is as I just had a big bag of prewashed so I just barely covered the baking sheet I used with the kale and then sprinkled it with enough cheese to glue it together. I did watch it rather carefully towards the end and waited until it was a nice golden brown before removing it from the oven. A bit longer then the 10 minutes in the original recipe. I'm sure everyone's ovens are different and that should be taken into account. This is a great way to get nutritous greens into kids. This definitely is a do-over recipe for me. Can't wait to play with the ingredients a bit too parmesan different spices etc. Thanks for a great recipe.",
