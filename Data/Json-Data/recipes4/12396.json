I added a little more lemon juice because I had extra.  I couldn't find canned roasted red peppers, espeiclally in 4 ounce sizes so I just estimated.  \n\nThe hummus smells like salsa, but tastes great.  Texture is perfect, as well.  Just note that it makes a lot more than you would expect it to make, and hummus can be super filling.  The next time I make it, I probably will slice up some of the red pepper to make chunks in it (I know, not much of a hummus that way, but it works).",
