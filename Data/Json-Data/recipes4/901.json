I also added some fresh basil over top of the tomatoes and a bit of mozzarella cheese along with the Parmesan. The balsamic marinade on the tomatoes really adds a nice tang to the sandwich - delish!",

My only mods were adding 50% more of each herb, salting the tomatos after marinading and adding more cheese for the \"bubbly effect\". EXCELLENT WITH CREAMY SOUP! and great for appetizers when served in bite sized pieces open-faced! AND THE MARINADE CAN BE EASILY CONVERTED INTO A NICE VINEGRETTE, instead of having to throw it away or boil it.",

Also because it was summer I added fresh chopped herbs to the mayo mixture, parsley, rosemary and basil.  As it was a poolside lunch, I put the prepared sandwiches on a foil lined, thick cookie sheet and put it on the grill and closd the lid for about 5 minutes.  But broiling would give it a bubbly top.  Also, THICK DENSE bread is a MUST!  And remember to toast the bread first.  Thank you so much for this recipe, my daughter the vegetarian even asked for the recipe.",

I used Newmans Own Olive Oil and Vinegar (a salad dressing) instead of your sauce but it was close enough. I also used sliced american cheese. It was amazing! My mouth is still watering! And as for the mayo..gosh it was heavenly. I did add some garlic powder like a few others suggested which made it even better. When I put it in the oven I was already waiting for it to come out! It smelt great and was so good! I love it so much that I created an account here JUST to review it. Thank you so much for this mouthwatering recipe!",

Next time I might try fat free mayo to cut down on the calories but other than that these were awesome. Two thumbs up kat!!",

I slice them thick and only differ from the recipe in that I add a little garlic powder to the mayo spread and salt the tomato slices before adding the parm on top.
