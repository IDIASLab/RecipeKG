Slice the dogs as stated or you can also use sausage dogs and put them under the broiler on a baking sheet - browning both sides.  Then put the flat side down.  We add a good squeeze of mustard before putting the potatoes on.  I grate 1-2 cups of cheddar cheese into the mashed potatoes (opt.) when I am mashing them and then cover the dogs with a long scoop of the potatoes and place a slice of cheddar cheese on top and put them back under the broiler until the cheese melts.  No need for boiling the dogs or transferring anything to the casserole dish. casserole dish!",
