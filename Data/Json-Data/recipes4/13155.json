I was getting a bad feeling when I was cooking the grits themselves but it all came together when I returned the meat and cheese (but then again doesn't bacon solve most of the world's problems!). Heeding another reviewer's comment I seeded and dried the tomatoes before I cooked them. They still tinged the dish slightly red but it didn't taste like tomato sauce. I also reduced the amount of ingredients to 1/3 (just 2 servings) and it still made a lot for two people. Overall it was a good dish but it took me an hour and twenty minutes from start to finish. Good dish for a weekend meal but too much for me to handle during the week.",

Cooking the tomatoes onion and bell pepper together pulled all the juice out of the tomatoes and my grits are much darker - like they were mixed with tomato sauce. Also this makes WAY more than 6 servings. More like 12 really. I have no idea what I'm going to do with all the extra. Having said that the family liked it and I added extra hot sauce to my bowl which I think improved the flavor.",
