Therefore I decided to 4X the sauce ingredients except for the beef broth (I used 2 - 14.5 oz cans for that). I ran out of soy sauce so used some teriyaki sauce I had on hand. I added 1 tsp. liquid smoke, 1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp. ground ginger, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp black pepper to liquid then added it to the meat in the slow cooker. I cooked for 1 hour on high setting and then 4 hours on the low setting. Meat turned out very tender but the sauce needed some work (which after reading previous reviews I expected). I strained the sauce into a saucepan and brought to a boil and continued boiling for 15 minutes. Then I added 1/4 cup cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup cold water, returned to a boil and cooked until thickened. Next time I'll use 1/2 cup of cornstarch and cold water b/c the sauce was still a little thin. However, the taste was GREAT!!! I'll be making this again soon!!!",
