There are two small things I would modify when I make this recipe the next time: #1 - I will add 1 more tsp of peppermint extract (I want more flavor in the cookies) and #2 - I will place only six cookies on each baking sheet. They really spread out quite wide and I didn't leave enough space between them. Otherwise they're simply exquisite! Buttery crispy gorgeous looking. A winner!",

In one oven I used my regular cookie sheet in the other oven I used my Pampered Chef baking stone. The cookies on the stone took longer and did not spread out like the others. Next time I will only use my cookie sheets. I was also nervous about flattening them too much. After making the first batch I really pressed them down and they turned out better. I also tried to make the edges uniform after I pressed down first batch. They look nicer in their natural shape. Lastly I overcooked a batch because I thought they would look more golden when they were done so I left them a little longer. They were still fine but a little harder than I think they should be. I love these pretty buttery minty cookies! These are a must bake at Christmas time. Thanks Island Girl!",

It alarmed me though when I first starting preping them that there's so much butter I will cut back the butter by 1/2 & I think maybe get the same results. These are really yummy though I made some to give to the leasing office tomarrow for Christmas Eve I ate 8 to myself when they came out the oven. You dont need to keep them 3 inches apart though 1 inch is enough room. There's no baking powder or soda they dont rise they stay the same size as you plop them on there. I did 1 cup white flour & 1/4 cup wheat flour to make them healthier & no one can tell:-) Wonderful Christmas cookie I will make these years to come I love them.",
