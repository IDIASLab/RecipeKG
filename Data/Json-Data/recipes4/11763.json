Then 1 Cup meat juices (including onion it was cooked in)and 1 cup plain yogurt instead of whipping cream. I suppose you could use sour cream or half sour cream & half whipping cream. I added salt and pepper to this.  It was good but it's an acquired taste so if you don't like vinegar all that well stay away from this recipe.  I served it with potato pancakes and sweet and sour cabbage.",
