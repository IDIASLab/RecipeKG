It is a great soup for those who like to try something different every once in a while. Ground Egusi seeds give this soup a unique color and flavor. If you can't find Egusi seeds, you can substitute pumpkin seeds. Any combination of crab, shrimp and smoked fish can be used in place of the shrimp.  Drained, smoked oysters and chicken can be used in place of the beef.",

It almost has a \"bisque\" quality to it but \"nutty\" as well. I used fresh crab which made it tiring to make -- and as careful as we were in taking the meat out of the shell we still found shell bits in our soup. My mistake was trying to eat the entire recipe over the course of a number of consecutive days. It's way too rich to try to eat it that way. Again highly recommended to give to people as a one course appetizer at a party.",
