I seasoned the chicken breasts with powdered ranch dressing mix just because I thought there needed to be a multi-level seasoning on the chicken. It worked. 14 oz. is way too much broth it was rather soupy. The only way I would use that much broth in the future is to try putting dry pasta in then to extend the slow cooker time to cook the pasta. I did as another reviewer suggested and used pepper flakes instead of jalapenos. Over all VERY tasty.",
