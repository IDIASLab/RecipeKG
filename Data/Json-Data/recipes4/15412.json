I skipped the salt, which wasn\u2019t necessary because of the bouillon or chicken base. This was excellent, actually.  And elegant.",

BUT, I used YELLOW RICE (\"Par Excellence with Saffron\" from BJs'). \nI just knew it wouldn't need: salt, pepper, garlic powder, bullion, broth or ANYTHING ELSE! \nI also knew that I was taking a chance & warned Wifey that she would be a 'test subject'\nHappy to report that the experiment was successful!\nThe YELLOW RICE filled out ALL of the other flavors beautifully & took out all of the guesswork!\nThis was our main dish and we both loved it!\nThis will be a regular veggie-night dish, for us!!!",
