I used a homemade ranch dressing mix (I suggest using Scotdog's dry ranch dressing mix) and I did not add garlic salt because the ranch dressing mix had garlic powder. This is great for a movie snack for the kids and to portion out into snack bags for my oldest boy's lunch. NOTE: You really have to keep an eye on these so they don't burn. I suggest you line your baking sheet with foil and do a little spritz with baking spray and really just keep it moving every ten-fifteen minutes so it does not burn. It's not two hours that this needs to bake. Fourty five minutes is plenty, give or take.",

I was worried the ranch would make these too salty but they were fine. I would make these again when I need a change from plain 'ol pretzels but I don't think I'll crave them often.
