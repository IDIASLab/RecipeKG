I didn't add cabbage. I've been avoiding flavored liquid like beer for corned beef because I never liked the end result. I didn't know what to expect using beef stock and assumed the other recipe would be preferable. Nope; this was much much better. This will be the only corned beef recipe I'm using from now on. It was delicious. I cut the final step to 1/2 hour because I got nervous that it would dry out; you can judge for yourself.",

This recipe was easy to follow and unlike the \"boiled dinner\" I refused to eat as a child this actually looked appetizing! Even my two picky daughters loved it. The only changes I made to the recipe were that I didn't have beef stock so I substituted 4 beef bullion cubes and a Guinness beer with enough water to get within the recommended 2\" of the top. Also I minced 12 cloves of garlic in with the olive oil before I brushed it on the meat and potatoes (prior to roasting.) We will definitely be making this again!",

I added carrots and did large 'rustic' cuts on the vegetables to prevent overcooking. I did drizzle honey a couple times over the beef during the oven time. Puts a nice glaze on the meat. My wife was never a big corned beef fan. Now she is and I don't have any leftovers for hash! Will be making again soon!",

Add the cabbage and cook for 45 minutes and then add the potatoes cut bigger than bite size so that they don't break apart in pot. We put the sliced beef brisket back in the pot the last 30 minutes.
