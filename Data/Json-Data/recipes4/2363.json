I used plain bread crumbs and added a generous teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  I nixed the rice crispies - only because that's the only ingredient that I didn't have on hand.  I decided against adding melted butter on top of the chicken (I figured there was enough fat already with the cheese).  I also baked at 350 for 45 minutes - I've found that the trick to juicy baked boneless skinless chicken breasts is to bake them at exactly this temp and length of time.  My husband (who is picky about food) actually said \"wow\" when he saw the finished product.  He also specifically asked that I add this dish into my dinner rotation.  Bravo!  This was a HUGE hit!  I served it with steamed brocolli, pineapple casserole (will post this recipe soon), and garlic parmesean biscuits (will post this recipe soon as well).",

I just wanted to say that I made it for 17 people when my fiancee' and I went to the beach with his family and my family. There were a few very picky eaters in the bunch but this recipe was a success with them.  I cooked 24 pieces of the cheddar chicken for dinner one night and I think there were only 2 or 3 left over.  They were very quickly warmed up and eaten for lunch the next day.  This is one of the best chicken recipes I have ever used.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.",

I did make a couple of changes to the original recipe though - 1)I used shredded asiago cheese instead of cheddar 2)I baked it for 45 minutes as suggested by others 3) I used Crispix cereal since that was all I had 4) I dredged the raw chicken thru sour cream before the flour mix 5) I didn't use butter on the bottom of the pan, but did over the tops and then added a little more topping. Turned out amazing... my whole family loved it. I served it with noodles and alfredo sauce, but it would be excellent with spaghetti and marinara too. We'll be having this one again!!",

Followed the recipe except I put the garlic powder, salt, and pepper directly on the chicken before dredging it in the flour. I also decided to skip putting all that butter in the bottom of the dish... just sprayed it liberally with nonstick cooking spray. Baked 35 minutes and then broiled it for 3-4 minutes to give it a nice crispy top. Served with mashed potatoes and garlic green beans for a very tasty meal! Thank you!!!",

Not only was it quick and simple to prepare (had most ingredients on hand anyway) but the chicken was delicious! It was juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside - I did put the oven on broil for 2 minutes after the 35 minute cooking time was through just to get the tops a little more browned. It's also great as leftovers heated up or sliced chilled and thrown into a salad. And it can be made into a lower fat dish just by substituting out the cheese for low-fat and cutting down on the butter a little or all together: spray the pan with Pam or grease lightly with olive oil and omit the butter drizzle. Thanks for the new simple and versatile chicken dish!",
