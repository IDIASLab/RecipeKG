The flavour of the soup was really nice and definately an easy and quick meal to make but I found teh quinoa totally fell apart and turned to mush rathar than held it's shape which also lead it to taking up the majority of the volume of the soup. If I was to make this again I would cook the quinoa separately and add it to bowl fulls of the soup rathar than a one-pot deal. That way you would keep the nice \"pop\" than perfectly cooked quinoa has.",

I added: mushrooms lots of chopped fresh basil a couple bay leaves a dash of thyme and a can of white beans I left out: celery (didn't have it) and parsley (since I focused on basil instead) It turned out beautifully though I still thought it could use a bit more spice. Not sure what though. A jalapeno pepper might do it some good. I have a cold and this really hit the spot as a veggie soup remedy. If you don't want the quinoa to go mushy make sure you cook it just long enough for all the veggies to be tender. You'll see the quinoa is ready when it \"pops\" open and floats to the surface instead of being grounded on the bottom of the pot.",
