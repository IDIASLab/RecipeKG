One is I placed the ramekins in a pan of water while cooking, cooking time will likely need to be increased if you use refrigerated ingredients, and I didn't carve out the avocado.  I cracked the egg into the avocado and used a thin knife to cut the white and let it run down in the ramekin. I also seasoned the entire avocado half, inside and out with seasoned salt. I added some chopped precooked turkey sausage. And sprinkled a little finely diced onion over them, a few slivers of Parmesan cheese, and topped with a little paprika for color.  What's not to like?

This was all I had so had to remove some of the egg white in order not to spill over.   (And yes, I carved out more space in the avacado).  There is no way this dish is ready after 15 mins of baking.  Unless you want to eat runny egg whites.  I baked mine for 35 mins.   The final end product just was not that tasty.    It may work better to add onions and cilantro ie to avacado and bake and simply add a fresh cooked egg on top after baking.",

I cut out an egg sized hole out of the avocado (I actually traced the egg with a toothpick), and scooped it out down to the skin (being careful not to pierce the skin).  I then used a mortar to grind together 1/2tsp. each of garlic granules, onion granules, ground ginger, sage powder, and 1/4tsp. each of cumin and Australian flake salt.  I sprinkled this mixture over the entire avocado, and ground some black pepper on top too.  I then added about 1/4-1/2tsp. olive oil to the cavity in the avocado.  I scrambled the eggs in a jar (you just put the lid on and shake) then I poured this into the hole; on top of the oil, and seasoning.  I then put sliced mushrooms across the top to keep the egg in the avocado while cooking.  The oil made the egg rise to about where the other half would have been height wise when done.  Once out of the oven I added grated Swiss cheese, and chopped peppers (I used sarano, but any would be good) on top.  I then cut each half in half (effectively quartering the avocado), and took the peel off before serving.  So yummy!",

However that was primarily due to: a)our 1st time; b)avocado being too ripe; c) cooking temp too low; d)frustration when adding egg to avocado half & trying to transfer them to the oven without chaos. All I can say is try it more than once & don't be afraid to experiment a little. Because our subsequent meals of baked avocado w/egg & an addition -if any- of choice have been well worth it!",

It's meant to be a healthy breakfast and you can add your own toppings. Yes healthy fresh food is actually less flavorful than processed foods smothered in dairy products. That's where spices come in. I needed to cook these twice as long as the recipe calls for but maybe it needs to specify that they are room temperature products as I had mine refrigerated. I nixed the bacon added lots of garlic powder and pepper and a bit of sea salt and dill. Smothered it in organic salsa and it was delicious! Will make this again.",

I used some of suggestions from other raters. I scooped out some of the avocado for the egg eyeballing how much needed to come out this will vary depending on the size of avocado and egg. I cracked my egg into a teacup and then scooped out the yolk and put it in the avocado hole.. and then added the egg white til the opening was full. Some did seep out into the ramekin..but like one rater suggested I added a bit of water and let it poach. As another rater suggested I salt/peppered/garlic powdered the entire avocado before adding egg then sprinkled egg with seasoning also. Once baked I added a nice dollop of salsa to the top. It was Yummy. I think you just have to tweek this recipe til you get it how you like it. I think melted cheese and a bit of sour cream would make this yummy too. As for what to do with the scooped out avocado.. I say... EAT it... Yum!",
