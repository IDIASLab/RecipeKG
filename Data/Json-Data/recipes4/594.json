This was a little more labor intensive than I thought it would be. Used only a 3-ounce package of pepperoni but added a drained can of mushrooms to offset the lack of pepperoni. This was pretty good served with some heated up spaghetti sauce. I couldn't believe how big the loaf was -- we had leftovers that I had wrapped up in foil. I think it was even better today because the bread was a little fluffier softer. Anyway I am going to make this many more times and experiment with other ingredients like turkey and colby/jack ham and Swiss etc.",
