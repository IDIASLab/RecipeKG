There's TOSTONES which you fry using green plaintains. Cut them staight down into 1 inch circles & then proceed with above recipe.Use the bottom of a mug to mash.These are salty & usually with some garlic in a bit of oil. THEN there's PLATANOS which you cook with ripe or yellow plaintain. Those you slice sideways and pan fry untill golden brown. These are the sweet kind. Hope this helps everyone. ENJOY!",
