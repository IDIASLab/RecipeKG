I will be using this recipe again.  Thank you for a great recipe.",

It totally overpowers the pork, which will be cooked to a hockey puck if you follow the instructions in this recipe. We will not make this again, but if you really want to try it this is what I suggest: 1) put only sliced or minced garlic into the pockets cut in the roast. 2) make a minced fresh rosemary and olive oil mixture with salt and pepper to taste; lightly spread over the roast. 3) cook the pork in a pre-heated 325 degree oven for 20 minutes/pound. Check with a digital thermometer. Pork is done at 145 degrees. The veggies prepped as instructed wll be done. Let roast rest 3 minutes. Eat. \n\nNote: Deglazng with wine is optional. Personally, I think just drinking the wine is better.",
