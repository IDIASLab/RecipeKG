I sauteed the chicken in a little butter and added diced onions and two cloves of garlic to the chicken while cooking to it.  I also added some onion powder, salt and pepper.  I used the amount of soup called for, but doubled the amount of stuffing and it paid off big time.  Be sure to bake it uncovered so the stuffing isn't soggy.  This was really good and I'll definitely make it again.  My kids loved it too.",

I bought a can of low sodium chicken broth instead of using my own reserves as well. I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of mushroom. I mixed ALL of the ingredients together (chicken, soups, stuffing, and some extra onion and garlic powder) and apread into baking dish. I put a layer of stuffing I set aside on the top of the mixture so it would have a crispier topping. I also used Pepperidge Farms Seasoned Stuffing Mix, it came out great. I realize I made quite a few alterations, but it came out tasting absolutely wonderful. Thanks for the start!",

I baked the casserole in a 9x13 pan (20 min. covered, 15 minutes uncovered). We could NOT stop eating this!",

My only problem was that I bought a rotisserie chicken, already cooked, from our store and that wasn't quite enough chicken for this dish. However it saved a bunch of time!  Next time I will add more chicken. These amounts were perfect for a 9x13 dish.  I cooked mine for 35 minutes total uncovered and it turned out wonderful!  With these changes this is an excellent recipe!!!  ",

I sauteed about 1/3 c chopped onion and 2 stalks of chopped celery in 4 T butter til translucent and tender and then added that plus about 1 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning to the chicken broth. I only made a 8x8 pan of this but if I had made a larger pan I would recomend doubling the stuffing mix. I used only 2 large breasts since I was making a smaller dish and the ratio of chicken to dressing was perfect. I covered this with aluminum foil and cooked for 30 minutes and then removed the foil for the last 15 minutes of baking since some reviewers said it dried out. This is a great comfort food meal. Really simple and quite tasty.",
