The best sorbets are made not by exact measurements but rather by balancing the sweetness of a particular batch of fruit to assure the best flavor and consistency. Too much sugar will prevent the sorbet from freezing and will overwhelm the fruit; too little makes an unpleasantly tart icy sorbet. To achieve the optimal balance rinse a raw egg and carefully drop it in its shell into the fruit mixture. When the mixture is in balance the egg will be partially floating exposing a circle the size of a dime to a nickel above the surface.\" (Tip from food website.)",

I made a simple syrup with a half cup water half cup sugar heating until dissolved and opted for a true sorbet by omitting the cream - although it would make a very nice frozen dessert with it. I always taste the fruit first and since my berries were sweet I knew the reduced sugar would work in this. I pureed the blueberries raspberries and blackberries in my blender - maybe a food processor would grind the seeds better but I definitely needed to strain the mixture to get the seeds out. It was a little soft when done - perhaps because I used fresh instead of frozen fruit? - but I popped it in the freezer for about 20 minutes and ended up with the firmer texture I was looking for. Will definitely make this again!",
