I love it because there's no yeast, and it's just so easy to make!  You can top it off with vegetables when there are about 5 minutes left on the baking time, or you can just season it with herbs and Parmesan cheese--my personal favorite.",

Instead of using all white flour i used half white and half whole wheat, it came out delicious. As for topping my focaccia i added fresh ground pepper, rosemary, and carmalized onions. As it started to bake i could smell the rosemary aroma wafting in the room. When i removed the bread from the oven i let it sit for about 5 minutes, then cut into it. The edges where crispy, not like the normal kind of edges you'd get if you make the yeast kind focaccia,i also think it's partly because when i tried to make the focaccia fit the pan the edges where the thinnest part. The middle of the pan is nice and soft. Overall it's a good recipes, but i'll probably try the yeast kind and compare it later.",

I doubled the amount to make 2 loaves for a dinner event (mixing in my KA w/ dough hook) and took the advice of one other poster to bake in my two round 9\" cake pans. I did have to add a bit more flour (1/3 C or so)so that it would all come together nicely. It is a sticky dough but with well oiled hands it settled into the pans nicely. I did let it rest in the pans for about an hour prior to baking. Don't know if this made a difference or not but it certainly didn't hurt it. It rose somewhat and was very soft and tender. I also topped with a parmesan cheddar mozzerella combo. Easy as could be and great bread with on hand ingredients. Will make again.",

I had all the ingredients so I thought I'd give it a shot. Incredibly easy! I had to add extra flour to get the dough to the right consistency but it came out fluffy with a bard crust at the bottom. I baked it in a large frying pan and it turned out beautifully. I HAD to add some rosemary to it. One of the easiest most delicious bread recipies I've tried! Thanks a lot!",
