Who knew so few ingredients could produce such a tasty little scone! I had exactly 2 cups left of some Bisquick I wanted to get rid of and I have to admit there's NEVER a shortage of beer around here so with just the third ingredient up for grabs I opted to give these an Italian flair.  I used 1/2 cup of shredded Romano cheese, 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan, 1 tsp. of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. each of oregano and basil, plus 1/4 tsp. of salt.  I baked it in a 9 inch round cake pan and sprinkled the top with a bit more shredded romano cheese.  It baked up nice and golden brown.  After it cooled I cut it into triangles.  It went great with \"Rachel's Tomato Basil\" Soup from this site.",

Cooked in the oven for 10 minutes than topped with another 1/2 cup of cheese and more Italian seasoning. I used Samual Adams Boston Ale for the beer. Great quick recipe when you don't have enough time to bake bread!",
