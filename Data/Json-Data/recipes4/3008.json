I put them face down in the microwave for 4 minutes with just enough water to cover the bottom of the dish. It cooked them til tender without making them soggy. (halved recipe so I only used 2 zucchini) The biggest change I made was I used cheddar instead of the mozzarella; and increased shredded parm and reduced bread crumbs to equal amounts. Also I didn't want to turn on the oven on a hot summer day so we made these on the grill. They didn't really brown on top but they were so delicious it just didn't matter. Great summer recipe!!",

My guess is the poor reviews come from reviewers overcooking the zucchini during the boiling process - which would cause it to taste soggy as they report.  I pre-boiled the water, dropped the zucchini in, boiled them steady for 2 minutes, then turned off the heat and let them sit in the water for the remaining 3.  They were perfect!... flexible, yet still firm.  Then, I brushed with oil, sprinkled with pepper and put under the broiler 5 minutes.  I stuffed each zucchini generously per the directions, and put under the broiler one minute.  The topping was browned, the cheese melted, and it was crispy on top, perfectly warm in the middle and the zucchini was perfect.  No soggy-ness whatsoever.  Fanstastic.  What we loved most was that they were a refreshing take on stuffed potato skins without the heaviness of the starch and gritty-ness of potatoes and skins!  We gave this a 5 out of 5.  This is a definite keeper.  Love it, and thanks for the recipe!",
