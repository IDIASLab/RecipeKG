I felt that it was lacking some crunch... so I threw in toasted almond slivers and pine nuts - PERFECT! I can't wait to make this again!",

I didn't have onion so just saut\u00e9ed the kale in garlic and coconut oil which adds another level of flavor to greens. I think onions would have been a nice addition. I also didn't have creole seasoning and after a little research ended up using cajun seasoning with some extra basil thyme and oregano which tasted good. Added some almonds as some other reviewers suggested but probably would not do that next time since it didn't seem to add much for us but left it on the stove due to some timing issues so the nuts didn't add the crunch factor others mentioned so that could be it. Wanted to add the lemon others suggested but also didn't have any (hmmm looks like we have a theme developing!); so I added a splash or two of white wine vinegar to give it a little zip. That was good but I still think lemon would be better. Will definitely try again when I have lemons and onions!",
