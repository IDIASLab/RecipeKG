I had no shallots so I substituted onion garlic and ginger. The ginger flavor was subtle but added complexity. I used boulion insted of beef stock. I added some chopped bacon to add some smookey meat flavor. I thought it could use a thickener so I added a teaspoon of flour/water. Next time I think I would chop the onions and garlic a little larger to keep the sauce more chunky. I trippled the recipe (6 servings) for the sauce because it looked so good. Now I have leftovers.",

I think the sauce mixed even better with the scallop! There's a local restaurant that does a simila sauce that everyone raves about but this sauce is superior. Thanks!",
