What I do is boil chicken breast and then put them whole in the crock pot and use cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. Use the remaining ingredients listed in this recipe (I use basil only though). I will also add some baby carrots and fresh button mushrooms and let it cook for about 3-4 hrs on low or until you can shred the chicken easily. The \"soup\" becomes rich and super yummy. My fav toppings are celery green onion tomatoes cheese chow mien noodles and a few pineapple chunks. Sooooo good!!",

Families I know who use this as an 'after Thanksgiving' meal enjoy it more than the big feast!!! We personally like to toast the coconut and we never used chow mein noodles and I think I'll continue to pass on them (since they are fried) but I'm sure they would taste really good in this dish. Really you can't go wrong with this type of dish..... YUM!",
