Instead of having to wait for bread to thaw, I used 3 tubes of Pillsbury Buttermilk bisquits and cut each one in half. I just sprinked the parmesan cheese between the layers so I used more than 1/2 cup. Overall, it was an appetizer and dessert for some of the family. Thanks! It was great!!!",

Also place a piece of foil in the bottom of the oven to catch spills.\n\nI used Rhodes frozen dinner rolls and only one egg, omitted the salt, added a stick of butter and a tablespoon of minced garlic (in addition to the garlic powder), made sure to chop the green onions and parsley extra fine, and used 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan, 1/4 cup Colby/Jack and 1/4 cup Mozzarella cheeses. I blended all ingredients together in one bowl and dipped each ball into the mixture -- there was just enough.\n\nAfter baking for 20 minutes, I placed a piece of foil over the top of the pan and baked 15 minutes longer than the recipe calls for.\n\nSince the recipe doesn't specify what you do after baking I did the following:\n\nRemove pan from oven, immediately inverting it onto a plate, loosen the rolls from the pan and allow it all to sit for about 10 minutes before removing the pan from over the rolls. Sprinkle the top with 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan and lay a piece of foil (loosely) over the top for about 10 minutes so the cheese will melt. Allow to cool completely (uncovered).\n\nI found it best to slice individual cake-sized pieces to create a cheese swirled bread. I served this with my own version of the trending \"Pizza Casserole\" and it was a huge hit! I will definitely make it again!",
