This is the first indian dish I haven't bombed thus far.... so I definately count this as an easy meal!  Relatively cheap, too.  If you already have all of the spices on hand, the rest of the ingredients add up to about $10.  ***updated***  I previously forgot to mention that I omit the garam masala (it changes the flavor and I like it better without).  Additionally, cutting the cayenne pepper by about half allows one to be able to taste the wonderful flavors instead of mostly just feeling the heat.  Hope this helps!",

I can't put my finger on it but there was something missing from this recipe. It was really good and I will make it again and play with the spices a bit (definitely cut back the garam masala and the cayenne too if you don't want it too hot!). I think I may saute the spices next time with the onions and garlic maybe that will bring out their flavor more? The heat of the cayenne seems to overpower the other flavors here. I also agree that the full can of coconut milk is a bit much it probably does only need half unless you like it really wet/saucy. Overall we really enjoyed this! And it made A LOT of food have frozen half to see how well it keeps for a future meal! And there's still plenty left for lunch today. So great as this was a very inexpensive meal to make. Served with basmati rice and naan great dinner! Thanks!!",

                "reviewBody": "When I was reading the recipe I said to myself; \"A TBSP of salt? Really?\" But yes a TBSP of salt. Really. It's all that salt that really opens up your taste buds and then ALL that cayenne makes you want to cry from the fire-hot sensation coated across your tongue. To be clear I didn't mind this dish but I agree that there is something not quite right about the spices. The salt should be cut at least half and that a TBSP of cayenne is waaay too much. Honestly I'd probably only add a TSP since all you can taste is heat past the first bite. Garam Masala is pretty much just an exact repeat of the spices that are already in this dish but it also has some clove and nutmeg. I didn't mind it but it's not a necessity for this dish. UPDATE: Okay... I was totally dreading the leftovers but I enjoyed this WAY more after it had been sitting in the fridge for a couple of days. The flavours worked a lot better but it was still too salty and too hot. I decided to try this dish again. Given how saucy the dish is it is perfectly adaptable to the slowcooker. Follw step 1 then everything into the slowcooker. Frozen cauliflower and potatoes slightly smaller than 1\" cubes on high for 5 hrs cooked everything to the point that some was stuck on the the sides. Could have cut cook time to 4 hrs and been fine. Used about 1 tsp salt and about 1 tsp cayenne and used the garam masala. Much preferred the heat but had to add salt after cooking. Great to be able to do this in the slowcooker:)",
