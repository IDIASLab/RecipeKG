For those who prefer more sauce, a simple white sauce can be made sauteing flour in melted butter to make a roux, then adding a couple cups of broth and stirring until thickened. Flavor with garlic, herbs or anything (even dijon mustard!).",

I love the flavor of the garlic and the olives--sharp flavors and makes it hard to miss the red sauce (which I LOVE)! I made French bread dough over the weekend for French bread but didn't end up making it. So I used that dough in this pizza. I baked the dough for about 20 min at 350 then added toppings and baked per the recipe. I didn't measure the olive oil but I didn't put that much on. You just need enough to brush it on and it's perfect. I also roasted the garlic over the weekend so I didn't use any of the oil from my garlic. Thanks for this recipe! Loved it!:o)",
