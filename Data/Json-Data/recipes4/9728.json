Had to go to a Japanese market to get it - but it was worth it.  They do sell miso with dashi flavoring - which I used.  I used soft tofu, and added some sliced ginger while heating the soup.  It was just like my local restaurant - and I'm so glad I can make it cheaper than the $1.50 they charge for a small bowl.  Will fix it often!  Miso is supposed to be very healthy.  High sodium, though.  The market sold low-sodium miso - may try that when I'm out of the current one.",

If you're a potato lover, a simple but very comforting potato version  - in the quantity of dashi given here simmer thinly sliced wedges of potato (approximatly 2 medium potatoes, sliced 3 mm thick or so) and sliced onion (one small onion, cut in half vertically, and then into thin slices, again vertically).  Simmer until tender, and then add miso just before turning off heat.  Carrot, daikon, long onion (negi), spinach (add a minute or so before adding the miso) are other winter possiblities - add in any combination you prefer.  I often add thinly sliced deep-fried tofu (abura-age in Japanese) to my winter miso soup - a common staple here in Japan, but perhaps not so readily available elsewhere. \r\n",

I always use Shiro Miso, which is a white miso (less salty) than the Aka Miso, red miso paste. Some people also like to mix both for more bolder flavor. To whisk in the miso paste, I normally hold two spoons, with the miso paste in the first spoon and using the other spoon to mash the paste into the water. The dashi I use has no MSG and since I was only serving two people I scaled this amonunt down quite a bit. I don't use silken tofu but medium firm which is a personal choice. I garnished the soup with thinly minced green onions (see my picture). Miso soup doesn't take me too long to make. There are so many vegetables you can add in miso soup such as shiitake mushroom, daikon, other mushrooms, leafy greens, etc. This was a warm and satisfying soup that paired perfectly with, \"Japanese Deep Fried Shrimp,\" \"Japanese Shrimp Sauce I,\" \"Japanese-Style Sesame Green Beans,\"and \"Cucumber Sunomono,\" all from this website. I drank every last drop of miso soup!",
