No matter how much I soaked the meat in salt water buttermilk etc etc I could never get over the gamey taste... until this recipe! It is FANTASTIC! I soaked the meat overnight in cider and in BBQ sauce all day. Half of it I used turkey bacon and the rest regular. (regular was better turkey wasn't bad) It was delicious!! Be very careful not to overcook it or it will be tough and not as tasty. Thick sliced bacon isn't necessary. FINALLY I have a way of making venison that we can both enjoy. Thank you! What's better then grilled venison wrapped in bacon? Adding a slice of onion and wrapping it up with the meat. Yum.",
