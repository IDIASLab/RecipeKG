I also use 2 c. skim milk, and cut the butter to 6 tablespoons, and the flour to 1/2 c. It's still thick, creamy and delicious but cuts out a considerable amount of fat and calories, and adding vegetables gives it extra flavor and body. Perfect.",

After reading through it I knew  I wanted a heartier soup with more depth of flavor. I sauteed a few strips of bacon, then added chopped celery, onion, mushrooms and a big clove of garlic. Since I used a larger package of rice I decreased the amount of flour to 1/3 c. to allow for the added thickness the extra rice would provide, and I used 1 c. cream and 1 c. milk.  I also added an extra chicken breast and, during the final simmering, a healthy splash of white wine, probably a good 1/2 cup. The result was positively outstanding!  ",

Couldn't find it - had to use a 6.5 oz box with seasoning packet.  I cooked the rice separately (didn't add seasoning packet) - it cooked for 25 min.  While the rice was cooking I poached the chicken - both took 25 min. so they were finished together. Then I proceeded with the recipe but I left out the 2 cups of water since I was adding cooked rice.  (the uncooked rice would have absorbed the 2 cups of water if I had used it).  I used the seasoning packet as directed.  I did find that 3/4 cup of flour was too much - I was slowly adding it so I was able to stop before it was too late - I used probably about 1/2 cup.  Anyway - this was the creamiest, thickest soup I have ever tasted and the flavor was great - oh, I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and sauted some onion, carrots and celery and I am glad I did.  It was much thicker the next day so I just thinned it a little with chicken broth - milk would have done the trick too.  Thank you so much submitter.",

So, I made another pot today.  I think it would've been fabulous with no changes made but naturally I couldn't help myself.  Changes I made...used 3 cups homemade stock and 3 cups water/ chicken base (Minor's brand).  Because I used chicken base I omitted the salt.  I chopped a small onion and clove of garlic and cooked for a minute in butter/seasoning mixture before adding flour.  I reduced flour to 1/2 cup.  Used half and half instead of cream.  For the chicken I used 1 giant chicken breast that I grilled on my foreman and used the allrecipes Cajun Chicken marinade.  So the chicken was pretty heavily seasoned.  The folks who said this is restaurant quality are totally spot on.   Tonight I'm making bread bowls and serving it in that.",

I use Uncle Ben's quick cooking Long Grain and Wild rice, how easy can it get? I use a 16 oz. carton of half and half instead of heavy cream. I add chopped celery and carrots and cook them with the chicken. This is so thick and rich, absolutely delicious.",
