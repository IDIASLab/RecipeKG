It is what brings communities together! This very recipe!  (Okay, except cut the salt to tsp's instead of Tablespoons!)  It is not Pot Pie, it isn't supposed to have extra herbs or spices. This is the traditional way to make this fantastic soup that is served in every home, at Fire Halls, family gatherings, Bingo Night, Church Groups, carnivals, sports events, and even some Flea Markets.  I understand about the frozen vs. fresh corn because it might not be in season, but in PA Dutch Country - Cornfields ARE EVERYWHERE! It's corn country, it's cow country, it's pretzel country - it is Chicken Corn Noodle Soup country!  And ... it is awful to miss the food from there and then hear people giving this recipe 3 stars.",

Include the celery leaves in with the celery 3. Add 1/2 TBsp dried parsley 4. (crucial for a \"thicker texture\") substitute canned cream corn for some of the fresh corn.",

                "reviewBody": "I thought this tasted okay. The major down side is it is really \"SALTY.\" I really believe there is a (mis-print on the salt) and could be cut back to nearly half of what is written and be plenty. I am kind of thinking it should say 2 1/2 tsp and not Tblsp. Extra salt can be added later if it is needed but not taken out. I wanted to make homemade soup to get that fresh taste without the canned broth saltiness and had chose this. It is also very \"time-consuming\" and the recipe makes a lot more than suggested. I had to cook the soup in a large dutch oven pot and my largest sauce pan to hold it all with the recipe as written. I did like the fresh cut corn and the rivets which I have never eaten before. But overall for time it took and the amount of dishes I had to wash I was very dissapointed that the predominant flavor in the soup was salt.",
