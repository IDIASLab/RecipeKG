I will also experiment with baking/broiling instead of frying and/or using plain yogurt to cut down on the fat content. Will definitely be making these again!",

When slicing my eggplant I first skinned two sides with my knife so the slices I cut first from each of those ends would not be all skin on one side. One other tip: once oil is hot fry at medium temperature. The eggplant in the olive oil seems to burn easily. 5 stars b/c my husband loved these and said the texture and breading were spot on (I however don't care for eggplant in any capacity!)",
