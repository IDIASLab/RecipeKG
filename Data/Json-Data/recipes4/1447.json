We only used one tenderloin baked at 325 for about half an hour (turning halfway). I modified the rub for one by halving the chili powder and salt but keeping the remaining spices the same. I also added a 1/4 tsp garlic powder. There was enough of the rub to create a good coating all around the outside of the pork. Tasty stuff!",

While this is called \"spicy \" it is not \"hot.\" The spice flavor was fantastic- so much better than the pre-seasoned pork tenderloins that are so popular in the grocery stores nowadays. When it was cooking I could really smell the ginger and was a bit worried that it would be overpowering but it was not. I cooked half of a 3-pound tenderloin in the oven at 400 degrees for about 50 minutes. It came out perfectly moist and delicious. This will definitely be our go-to pork tenderloin recipe. Thanks!",

It came out tender and juicy and the \"gravy \" as my husband called the rub-seasoned drippings made a fabulous au jus. Thanks for the great recipe!",

We used 1T chile powder and 1T ancho chile powder and substituted garlic powder and onion powder for the ginger or to make it taste more like Flay's you could use cinnamon instead of ginger. Cooked it on the grill until the internal temperature reached about 145-150. Fantastic!",
