After reading previous reviews I added pepper and garlic to the marinade (and used red wine vinegar because that's all I had) and left bone in skin on chicken breasts marinating about 5 hours. I was so afraid during the day that I would be making pickled chicken but what a delicious recipe. I cooked the chicken on a rack and basted with the boiled marinade 3 times during cooking and the skin was crisp the chicken very moist and tasty. Usually I find that whatever you do to chicken tastes good on the outside but the chicken under the skin just tastes boring and plain but this was so juicy and flavorful (and not strong or vinegary at all). This is the best recipe I have ever used on this cut of chicken and will be a staple in my house from now on. Thank you!!",

It was great and not overpowering at all. I marinated for about two and a half hours but did not add the suggested marinade to my roasting pan. Actually, I put the chicken on a rack so it could crisp up all over and just basted every now and then. I also topped the chicken with my usual garlic and onion powders, salt and pepper and a bit of italian seasoning. Rave reviews \"Dinnersready\" and thanks so much!",

Well I made this last night for my fella and I. I used 1.5 cups apple cider vinegar and half cup italian dressing (as another suggested) used the 3 teaspoons salt BUT also added 1 teasppoon garlic salt. Also used Emerill's poultry seasoning - 1 tablespoon. I used chicken breasts -- delicious. They didnt get crunchy but they were SOOOO moist and flavorful (I like vinegar). Marinated for 1.5 hours. And served over white rice where I could ladel some of the oven cooked marinade over. If you like vinegar this is a keeper. Thank you for posting!",

I marinated for two hours and I still found the chicken boring even after adding my own spices.(garlic and pepper). The reason that I even gave the recipe a three is because of the sauce or should I say the potential of the sauce. Instead of discarding the marinade I drained it and removed the oil from the top. then boiled it for a min to make sure it didn't still have bacteria because the chicken at this point is still not cooked. I added a couple of cups of chicken broth. Thickened it just slightly with flour. Grated 3 cloves of garlic and added it in along with a teaspoon of chocken stock mix. It turned out like a jus. I ended up tearing the chicken up and eating it with my rice and smothered with the sauce. Yummy.",
