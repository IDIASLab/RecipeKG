I tried it a few years ago at a tapas restaurant and though it was delicious I promptly forgot all about it. Recently a coworker brought a huge bag of peeled garlic into work that she was trying to get rid of (after purchasing way too much at Costco!). I brought home about 30 bulbs of peeled garlic not knowing what the heck I was going to do with it - then I remembered garlic soup. Came across this recipe but I used chicken stock instead of bouillon and tossed in all of the extra garlic I had. It was just wonderful. Reminded me exactly of the soup I had tasted at the expensive tapas restaurant....and cooks up in no time!",

It doesn t look appetizing but it s very good (however I wasn t hungry for a 2nd bowl immediately it s more of an appetizer). I used 4 cups chicken broth and 2 cups of vegetable brother (chicken broth shortage). For those who called the soup bland I don t think they prepared the garlic right. If it isn t cut up enough you won t get the flavour out. I crushed then minced the garlic. For those who are wondering cup of garlic is about 2 complete flours of garlic minced (which is the amount I used). So yummy.",
