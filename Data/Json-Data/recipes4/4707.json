You can also disguise/dress them up by shaping the small tortilla shells into muffin tins and cooking them at 350 for ten minutes.  Plunk a meatloaf cup into each, and your meal looks even more appealing.",

Mine turned out just barely a tad mushy (fresh out of the oven only), which I think is my fault since I nearly liquified the veggies in the food processor, which the directions clearly state NOT to do. I did use breadcrumbs instead of couscous b/c that's all I had on hand. Leftovers re-heated GREAT in the microwave and were not mushy at all. My DH has been cringing all week thinking about this meal, NO ONE thought it would taste good and EVERYONE loved it. I can't complain a bit, this was delicious and I will make these often. I had enough to do a full cupcake pan (12 or 15?) plus I have a pan of 9 in the freezer. I did add 2 cloves fresh garlic when processing the veggies, and some salt and pepper, and did a 1/2 ketchup/1/2 BBQ/worshestire/red pepper flake topping instead of plain BBQ sauce, we like to spice things up in my house. Served with pierogies and veggies.",

It made 23 delicious meatloaf cupcakes. They reached 160 degrees in 18 minutes on 400 degrees oven.

I subbed a small green pepper for red and threw in some carrots as well. I didn't liquify the veggies but next time would keep them a lil large for texture (esp carrots for crunch). For the topping I used bbq sauce, tomato paste and chili pepper sauce. I made a dozen large cups and cooked 30m at 400. They were moist but still a lil bland. Next time I'll add some more seasoning (onion/garlic powder, basil perhaps) and definitely more sauce on top. Made with sweet potatoes and sweet and spicey green beans from AR. The sauce from the grean beans was great with the meat. Will do again soon and make adjustments!",

I used ground chicken instead of turkey, added a lot of salt, pepper, and garlic powder and will add even more next time.  My food processer is currently broke so I just shredded all of the vegetables (which probably added more veggies since I measured a more compact zucchini and onion).  Number one thing, I did NOT try to sell this as meatloaf to my husband.  I said that I made zucchini cups and he came into it with an open mind.  If I had said meatloaf, he would have expected meatloaf and it would have been the baked cauliflower that I tried to pass as pizza crust all over again:)",
