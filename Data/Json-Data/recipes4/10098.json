Instead of the onion soup mix I used Beef and Mushroom soup mix. WONDERFUL on flavour! The soup mix is made for beef and hits all the right spots and kicks the meatloaf up another notch! Instead of ketchup I use tomato paste..both before cooking and after. I 'paint' the tomato paste ontop of the loaf about half way through cooking. It's sweeter and gives a whole nother flavour!",
