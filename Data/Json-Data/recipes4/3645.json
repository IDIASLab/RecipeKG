I used a little less turkey than the recipe called for since it's just the two of us but used the full recipe. The turkey stayed very moist and stayed together on the grill. They do smell AMAZING! Most turkey burger recipes I've tried have not been very flavorful. These burgers are full of flavor and just enough spice but not too much even with the jalepenos. We will definitely make these again!",

I only had 1 lb of turkey so I cut back on everything-I used about 1/2 of all the ingredients had to substitute cayenne pepper for the chili pepper and I added more bread crumbs than the recipe called for. I refrigerated the meat for about 20-30 min's while I got everything else ready and it was real easy to form the patties which stayed 'together' perfectly. I pan fried these patties instead of grilling and they came out great they were really moist too. My hubby loved them too....we decided this is the 'way to go' as far as burgers. Better than beef especially with sauted onions wheat buns and all the sides!!! Thank you for the recipe!",

Browned them in a saute pan for 4 mins each side and then baked in the oven at 350 for 5 mins. YUMMY!!",
