They can be tricky to make heat needs to be just right and my stove tends to cook hot so I am constantly adjusting the heat and ended up with med-low temp. But that's not a recipe issue at all. I do not add cinnamon and use only very tiny amount of erythritol. I have also made them without any sweetener at all. You can add cheese to the mix and/or herbs for a more savory flavor. Add some taco seasoning and use them as a soft taco shell (they don't hold up to a lot of handling though so best as an enchilada type tortilla).",
