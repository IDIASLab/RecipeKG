I am wondering what I can add to hold them together better...I mixed everything up (even using all of the optional ingredients except for the meat) formed the patties and let them 'set up' in the fridge all day before frying them in hopes of avoiding breakage. Some did stay together but the majority did not. They still are delicious and I plan on coming up with a solution to the breaking problem. Thanks for sharing.:)",

I spread sour cream across the top added some salsa and cheese on top of that. It was so good. My husband isn't crazy about left overs but he loved this. Its been added to keep list.",
