The kale was from my backyard and was so delicious. I couldn't stop eating them and finished the entire bowl. I can't wait until the kale grows more so I can do it again.  GREAT recipe, thanks for sharing! I had always heard about kale chips but had never tried them, or kale before. Amazing way to use it. Do be careful with the cooking time b/c they can cook soo quickly. 5 mins was enough for me, if I left them in for 35 minutes I would have had nothing left but ashes! :)",

Any good vinegar will do. We used a Pinot vinegar and garlic sea salt. If you have trouble with timing it means you need to buy a thermometer for your oven and start cooking at the proper temperature. 35 mins is EXACTLY right: any earlier and the texture and flavor will not be right any longer and they will burn. In a single layer (which you want) a good sized bunch of Kale will take up two medium-large baking sheets. Finally be SURE your kale is dry. If it isn't you will be steaming it rather than roasting it. If you don't have a salad spinner do as I did and put the kale in a dish towel grab all the corners and swing it in a circular motion a la Pete Townshend. Enjoy!",
