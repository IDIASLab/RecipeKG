Personally, I cannot eat onions and green peppers, so I skip those.  You can use less or more rice depending on whether you wish to serve as a main or a side.  If you do not like spicy food, use mild sausage or all ground beef and no cayenne pepper or hot sauce.  Some Cajun purists may complain, but as a bonafide Coon A**, I can assure you that some of us cannot always eat with such gusto. A true taste of the Big Easy.",
