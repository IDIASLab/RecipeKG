I made just a few minor changes: sauteed fresh garlic with the meat instead of using garlic powder, added a few extra seasonings, and cut the meat down to one pound. As always, I used a little Ziploc baggy with the corner cut out to pipe the filling into the shells. Hassle free! I prepared this early in the day, refrigerated, then baked for dinner. Turned out great. Thanks :)",

Lastly, a quick tip I suggest to all even professional chefs, do NOT par boil your pasta first. If you are making this or manicotti, it is easier to stuff if you do it raw, then add a little watered down sauce to the bottom of the dish and seal it with tin foil. This will a help it cook in much better stuff than boiling water. You can also substitute wine to dilute your sauce.",

I made it for my family last night for the very first time - what can I say, it'll definitely be added to the rotation on cooler days!  The only things I did differently was substitute spaghetti sauce for the tomato paste and sauce, in addition to substituting ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese.  Piping the cheese mixture into the shells by using a baggie with the corner cut off was a brilliant suggestion.",

Then I poured 1 cup of water over the top of the sauce and added the cheese last. I covered tightly with foil and cooked for an hour and then turned off the oven and let it sit in the oven for 10 min afterwards. The shells were cooked perfectly and I didn't have an extra pot to clean! I did make this with 24 jumbo shells in a 13x9.",
