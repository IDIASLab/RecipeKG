The one thing I will say is that the stuff you buy in the supermarkets has already been cooked and then frozen so basically you are just heating them up. Unfortunately most all of the flavor you add during the heating up process gets kind of lost.  I used snow crab instead because that was what was available at my store and on sale. I really liked the  concept of sticking them in foil to heat up over sticking them in boiling water and this is most likely how I will do it from now on.",
