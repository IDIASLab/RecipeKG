I have shared this BBQ with family, friends, and co-workers, and they have told me that this is amongst the best BBQ they have ever eaten. I use a North Carolina style vinegar-based sauce when I make this, but this is the fun part of this recipe, because you can use any sauce you like and it turns out good. Your pulled pork makes good BBQ plates, or it is good on sandwiches also.",

Mine fell apart when I poked it w/ a fork at 8.5 hrs, so I put it back in the slow-cooker on the \"warm\" setting w/ Yuengling BBQ sauce for another 1.5 hrs b4 serving w/ salad for dinner. We were really surprised at how good this was, based on the simple ingredients and even simpler prep, but I can imagine that the brand and type of BBQ sauce could greatly influence this recipe's success.",

We opted to not add the bbq sauce and let each individual put their own desired type and amount on after the cooking was finished. Also, ours was done in about 8.5 hours but that could just be different slow cooker temperature deviations. This is simply delicious. Will be making again and again.",

I always do the first two hours on High, then turn the roast, and switch to Low. I did switch it to Low, but didn't turn it. I used a bit more than 1 cup of cider vinegar as my roast was larger than called for, and probably didn't put as much salt and white pepper, (I can't have black pepper), on it as some.\n\n I cooked it until 1:30, then took the meat out of the juice-which I have saved for cabbage soup, btw, and the meat was excellent then, but I wanted to try it with a new Heinz BBQ sauce-Carolina style with cane sugar and no HFCS. Heinz has several new BBQ sauce styles out without HFCS, and I was tempted by several, but I thought the vinegar-based Carolina would work best. (No, I don't work for Heinz.) 8)  I put it on, mixed it up and kept it on Low for another 45 min. I didn't make a sandwich, but used a tortilla and made a shredded pork burrito. It was excellent and I liked the Carolina-style sauce a lot. I just didn't feel like going to several stores for the ingredients for my own BBQ sauce-or cleaning the stove. I am going to freeze some of the meat for future use. \n\nThis is a keeper,  and definitely worth the five stars despite being  ridiculously easy-don't mess with it.
