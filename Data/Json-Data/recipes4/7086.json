The idea is to spoon them into the pan and slightly spread them out. They will firm up during the frying process. I had chopped pecans, so used these instead of walnuts. Only other change was to add a couple tablespoons of chopped onions. Yummy low-carb version of the tuna patties my mom used to make.",

The only suggestion I have is to add a small amount of panko or bread crumbs for consistency and to refrigerate the patties a bit before frying .  I find these better than the Easy Tuna Patties recipe, as we prefer the cheddar cheese to Parmesan, butter for frying rather than oil, and the herbs give these a great flavor.  The walnuts are another great addition - and I toast mine first for extra flavor.",
