I was unsure if they would actually hold together without something to bind them other than melted cheese. To my surprise they held together nicely. I did add a bit more in the way of seasonings (Italian) and I made my own marinara sauce rather than using something already prepared. I used 2 lbs of ground beef and 2cups of cooked rice to yield 21 approx 3\" diameter meat balls. My friend said she thought it tasted like lasagna in a meatball.  I served seasoned green beans, a green salad, and hot dinner rolls as an accompaniment and it was plenty. Thanks for a nice easy meal.",

Also, I actually had some pizza sauce that needed used up, so I went with that. I do know that pizza sauce is usually more heavily seasoned than regular sauce, so maybe that's why I didn't feel any other seasonings were needed, as others have mentioned. I was glad to see that these were baked instead of fried, because my usual recipe calls for frying and this was a nice change. Anyway, the flavors of these were great, they remined me of a cross between pizza (I guess from the pizza sauce) and lasagna. Wonderful recipe that I will be making again, for sure~YUM!

It would have taken quite some time but I made a pot of rice in a rice cooker the night before. I used 2 cups cooked for the recipe as 1 cup uncooked=2 cups cooked according to on-line. I always keep 'best marinara sauce yet' from on here in the freezer and used that. It is the perfect sauce. I put them on a large foil lined sheet and got 12 balls. I used a 1 Tablespoon cookie scoop and did 4 level scoops per ball. And they were a generous size! I had to bake about 5 extra minutes to get slightly crispy. The only change I would make is using 1/2 of the bread crumbs as about that much did not get used. Thanks for the delicious meal change this week.",

My toddler even dug right into it and cleaned his plate!!! I followed the recipe exact except I used Italian bread crumbs because thats all I use. I used my cookie scoop and it made 25 balls! Way more than we needed but we'll eat the leftovers for lunch this week:-) I baked for 30 minutes than put the broiler on high for a few minutes and they were nice and crispy!! We didn't find these bland at all! I used Prego traditional sauce since we had some leftover that needed to be used! Served with texas cheese toast. Thanks Queenbee28 I'll def make these again!",

I took a nibble in the beginning stage after I had mixed the cooked rice ground beef seasonings sauce and cheeses....I did feel it needed more of a zest flavor. My sauce was just a traditional jar of pasta sauce so I know I could have used something that was more vibrant in flavor. I think that really is the key too this recipe. All in all it was really good. I used a cookie scooper to make perfect balls and the batch made exactly 30. And I double dipped or double coated the balls in egg and (seasoned)bread crumbs. This was a total delight. Will make this again...that can also be a great football party appy as well as a main dish. Nicely done. I'm impressed.",

I even started over making them by adding more cheese to make them stick and they still fell apart. My fiance enjoyed them but the next time I make them it will be a Sunday night dinner. Much too time consuming for a weeknight meal.",
