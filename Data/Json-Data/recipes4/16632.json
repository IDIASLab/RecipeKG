I am what you could call a smoothie enthusiast and I'm always looking for great new ideas that incorporate a higher ratio of veggies. This one is definitely a winner! Made this just as written for my husband and I but did not need to add any water as cucumbers add enough liquid when using my Ninja Ultima blender. My husband just couldn't get passed the tartness of the lime and/or grapes so I ended up drinking both glasses. Very filling refreshing and nutritious! Make sure to add some ice though! Thanks again for this recipe! I'd definitely make it again!",

This came out kinda pulpy and I would have preferred something smoother (could be due to my blender or the fact that I normally juice my veggies instead of blending them) but the flavor is delicious. The grapes add the perfect amount of sweetness with just a hint of lime. A very healthy way to get broccoli in your diet!",
