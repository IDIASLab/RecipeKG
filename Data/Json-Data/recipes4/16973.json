Being from the Louisiana, I added onions, green peppers and celery plus a small amount of Cajun seasoning to the recipe and served over rice versus mashed potatoes. It was fantastic! The best Salisbury steak I have served in a long time. I have been searching for a recipe that would be a good foundation for my meal, and this one certainly fit the bill. Thank you for a dish that is destined to become a family favorite.",
