I didn't mind as the extra flavor from the soy sauce was wonderful. I upped the seasoning (curry) to 2 tsp. but that really was a bit too much. The curry overpowered many of the other flavors. I will use 1 1/2 tsp next time and that should be just right. Also I used sharp cheddar (my preference in cheese). I found that the cheese really brought the flavors together and was necessary in each bite - it really made teh flavors \"pop\". I did add some to the mixture but not nearly enough. I will likely use the 2 c. called for in the mixture next time and only a light sprinkle on the top of a little extra (maybe 1 c. if that much). I will cook the wild rice for an hour on the stovetop next time as mine was a little chewy even after baking (the wild rice I use - directions say cook for 1 hour). Over all this is a very filling meal - good comfort food for fall/winter. Will definitely make again! Yum!",

Other than adding a 1/2 tsp corriander and I used turkey instead of beef I followed the recipe exactly. It did leave little buttery pools on the plates. A whole stick of butter is really a lot but I think it was an imperative part of the flavor. Perhaps the fat/flavor could come from something a bit more solid... maybe mayo. I may give that a try. But I would make this again as is. ADDENDUM: Since this review I have made this several times. My fourteen-month-old LOVES this!! We can't keep her bowl full!! My parents and my in-laws (completely opposite tastes) all love it!!",

You gotta think there's a reason that curries topped with cheddar cheese have not taken off in fusion restaurants across the nation.",
