Adding even a tiny amount of horseradish makes it even better. If you already have a favorite corned beef recipe, you could still make the sauce to serve with your recipe. The sauce is silky-smooth, absolutely delicious, and makes the whole meal! Serve horseradish on the side, if desired.",

Not a good experience. This recipe was easy to prepare and was really good! The recipe didn't state whether to use the spice pack that comes with many corned beef briskets. I assume I was supposed to use it since the recipe doesn't call for any spices at all. The man of the house (who is of Irish background) thought it was very good and has had leftovers two days in a row. He said it reminded him of his Mom, which is a true compliment indeed! We enjoyed the sauce too. Thank you for submitting, Mmnadiv!",
