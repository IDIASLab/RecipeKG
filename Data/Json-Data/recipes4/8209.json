Get it ready, pop it in the oven and you have time to socialize while it's cooking! I cut this recipe in half and place it in a pie plate and bake uncovered for 45 minutes for breakfast for a smaller family; it tastes very much like a crustless quiche and my husband loves it! That is how it is shown in the picture.",

I used red, orange and yellow peppers.  One note, the ratio of eggs to milk is off.  The author of this recipe states at the bottom that she uses duck eggs but chicken eggs are fine.  Chicken eggs are smaller than duck eggs.  Use 1/2 cup milk for 4 chicken eggs.  A very pretty gluten free breakfast.",
