Wonderful flavors. My husband loved it. Will definitely make again.\r\n\r\nA few hints. I seared it in a dutch oven, then just added the rest of ingredients and braised it in the same pot. Cooked uncovered for the final half hour so the sauce would reduce slightly. Then to remove some of the fat, once cooked, I moved the roast to a platter, then put a colander over another pot and poured everything into it. Then I put the sauce into a fat separator, and put everything back into the pot together with the leftover juices (sans fat). Wonderful.",

The smell of it while it was cooking made my neighboring apartment dwellers jealous.  I will definitely make this again and again. UPDATE... I tried this again today. As I had plans that were going to keep me away from my home for the day, I decided to make this in my crockpot instead. It was even better! I followed the seasoning to the T... the only difference is that instead of roasting it in the oven, I cooked it on low for 8 hours in my crockpot. The crockpot is much smaller than my roasting pan so the liquids almost completely surrounded the pork. My boyfriend enjoyed it so much he went back for thirds!",
