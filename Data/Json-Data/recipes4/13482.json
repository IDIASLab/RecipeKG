I followed the recipe exactly except that I used a 7 pound pork shoulder (instead of 4 pounds)and the ratio of pork to sauce was perfect. (If I had used only a 4-lb. pork I'm sure it would have been swimming in sauce.) I cooked the shoulder for 6-1/2 hours then 'pulled' it then cooked it for another hour and a half. The mango sweetens it a bit and the chipolte chile pepper gives it a nice kick! Absolutely fabulous - thanks for sharing!",

I used 2 regular bottles of Kraft bbq sauce and I also used part of a raspberry-chipolte bbq sauce I had in the pantry. WOW. Iam sure it would have been fine without the touch of raspberry but MAN it made it so good and slightly sweet. Still spicy though. I cant wait to make this again I am running out of good things to say about it. Just give it a try you will not be sorry!!",

Anyone that makes this for the first time and tastes the juice before it's pored off, it is super spicy, but IT DOES NOT remain in the meat, just a subtle spicy zing with sweet BQ sauce. I use honey BQ sauce, it's great in this. I serve mine on a Kaiser roll with the classic spears of dill pickle. TO DIE FOR! I'm not much of a drinker and had no bourbon in the house so I went down to my local  liquor store and bought a little airline size bottle of bourbon for a buck fifty and it was just perfect.

I did listen to other reviewers and made the following changes: I mixed the salt, pepper and chipotle together and then rubbed the mix on the meat. After cooking, I trimmed the fat. I added only half of the sauce to the meat, and then added a bit more it to suit my preference for how saucy the pork should be.  The extra sauce on the side was a nice addition.  One note to those new to making this type of dish: if you can't shred the pork with two forks, it needs to cook more.  When it's done, it should only take a few minutes to break it all up. Happy eating!",

I thought the amount of barbeque sauce was too much so I added a total of 36 ounces instead of the 48 ounces that would be required if the recipe was doubled. The meat was very tender and I am glad I did not add the full amount of barbeque sauce it would have masked the chipotle flavor and mangos. I have never been able to find chipotle chili powder so I pureed about half a can of chipotles in adobo with the mangos. If I made it again I would probably add more mangos and chipotle chilis and less barbeque sauce!",

When you are using a crock pot instead of a low slow bbq you have to catch that flavor somewhere. I use whatever bbq sauce is on sale--but only fairly plain jane flavors. Using some crazy honey-hickory-papaya sauce is just overkill to me. Very glad you all like this recipe. I honed it over several years until I was satisfied.",

I had a bourbon \"marinade\" rub on hand and only one mango...but a gob of mango salsa from Costco did the trick for the rest. I also had no honey (what?!) so I used Agave necter. My BBQ sauce of choice was 16 oz Jack Daniels Honey and I used hot mexican chilli powder and Mrs. Dash's chipoltle seasoning. This was NOT too hot but definately flavorful. I know I totally played outside the lines here but I think I captured the essence of the sauce. SO GOOD. BTW I kept the au Ju from the pork and will make a nice pasole or something! The 5th star was for EASY. I served this with \"roasted\" butternut squash and red potatoes that I ALSO did in the crock pot!! GET OUT!! Yes a crock pot!! cut 'em coat 'em in olive oil your favorite italian seasonings & Kosher salt...heat 'em 4 hrs on high stirring occaisionally til done.",
