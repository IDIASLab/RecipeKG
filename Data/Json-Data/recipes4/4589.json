How can I modify it to my own family's preference?\" Rated on concept this recipe rates more than 5 stars. We used manicotta instead of shells for ease in stuffing pasta. Italian blend of shredded cheese instead of Swiss. Whole milk instead of cream. Sauteed the mushrooms with 2 tablespoons of finely minced garlic. Cut the shrimp in thirds. Seasoned them with Cajun seasoning and sauteed in a little butter for 2 minutes. Just enough to set the seasoning. Doubled the recipe with same amount of shrimp and used a like amount of imitation crab meat. (Wish we could have afforded the real thing. Maybe next time.) I think the leftovers reheated the next day may have been even better. Kevin this was a fairly inexpensive meal fit for a king. Thank you.",
