I didn't have whole milk on hand so I used a combination of skim milk and some FF half-and-half. Also used Trader Joe's light coconut milk in place of the full fat version. IMO the banana flavor is the superstar in this recipe and one that I've never seen before in rice pudding. You can taste all the different layers of flavor working with each other harmoniously. Theresa787 I haven't eaten a whole lot of quinoa but your pudding has persuaded me to try to incorporate more of it into my diet.",

I used 1c. unsweetened vanilla almond milk, 1c. whole goat milk, 1 large ripe plantain, 1 T. of maple syrup (instead of so much honey), and added more salt (2 pinches more).  This has a salted caramel flavor now.  I am used to quinoa so the flavor is just delicious, I my opinion.  Thank you for a wonderful, rainy-day dessert!  I am sharing this with all my cooking buddies!",
