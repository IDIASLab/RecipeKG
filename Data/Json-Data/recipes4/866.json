I halved the chili powder (actually I used a generous 1/4 cup), and used about 18oz of Hunt's Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ sauce. As for the sausages, I used hot (spicy sausages) and removed the casing before cooking the ground sausage meat. I cooked it for a total of 4 hours and have had several people ask for the recipe within hours of winning. It was just the right spiciness, just the right sweetness (not too sweet) and turned out fabulous! Great recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "This chili took second place at a recent chili cook-off that had fairly stiff competition (7 other decent entries).  Of course, what makes this particular recipe a \u201cwinner\u201d is its novelty.  Who doesn\u2019t enjoy chocolate? So here are my tips for taking a prize with this recipe:\n\n(1)  Give it a good name that includes the word chocolate.  No offense to Rick, but call it something like \u201cChocolate Chili Cha Cha\u201d.  This also warns away anyone who may be allergic to the key ingredient.\n(2)  Offer two toppings only: sour cream and shaved chocolate.  (Let the competition keep that dull cheddar cheese.)\n(3)  Add a few dashes (or more) of cayenne pepper to give it a little pep.\n(4)  Cut back on the BBQ sauce as others suggested, but consider adding \u00bc cup of brown sugar.  But be careful: don\u2019t make it too sweet.\n(5)  Add more beans (as I did) if you feel the meat to bean ratio is too large.\n(6)  Make it 36 to 48 hours prior to the competition to allow the flavors to meld.\n\nAlso, many people commented that the chili reminded them of a mole (MOH-lay) \u2013 a traditional Mexican sauce served over chicken or turkey that incorporates chocolate but is not typically sweet.  So, you may want to consider serving it with hot corn tortillas (instead of corn bread).  The idea is to set your chili apart from the rest of the competition.  Good luck\u2026and may the best chili win.  Yours.  [One last note: I sliced the onions into thin rounds and saut\u00e9ed them in a little of the bacon grease.  Delicious.]",

I consider myself a pretty decent cook but chocolate?  Well, I could not fathom this ingredient making so much difference in a dish but I read the reviews and decided to test.  Very nice addition and now I'm dreaming of using in other recipes for depth. Spicy sausage was a very nice addition as well.  Thanks for the post, this one is a keeper!",

I made the following adjustments: - For the spicy sausage I used one pound of hot and one of mild - Added one additional 12 oz can of diced tomatoes with jalapeno peppers - Added a dash of cayenne pepper - Used brown sugar bbq sauce instead of hickory smoked - Used three cans of kidney beans instead of four was plenty!

I added sauteed green peppers and onions and lots of other things to try and \"fix\" the taste but this was really pedestrian chili. My husband said it was \"fine\" but that's not what I'm going for. Sorry.",
