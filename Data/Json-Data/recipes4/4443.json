Instead of using dried onion, I chopped a medium onion, minced four cloves of garlic and added 1/4 cup of molasses to 3 pounds of flat iron steak, allowing it to cook for six hours. The end result is a sweet, tangy bbq sauce with fork tender steak. Wonderful!",

I also seasoned the meat with flour salt and pepper and used thin sliced onion. This is not a recipe that I would say is awesome BUT it was so quick to put together (10 mins start to finish) one bowl and the crockpot to clean and when I came home from work dinner was done. Could not get any easier. The coleslaw added a nice crunch. Used Sweet Restaurant Slaw from AR which is also very easy and served it with rolls and white rice. Will make again",

I made Honey Wheat Sandwich Rolls and Sweet Restaurant Slaw from this site to round out our dinner. The only thing I'd do different is to double the recipe and freeze some if it doesn't all get eaten! And I would try cutting the whole onion in slices rather than chopping so it'd fit better on the sandwich. I myself would really like this over rice rather than a sandwich but however it's made would be just fine! Very easy recipe except for the job of cutting off the fat from the meat beforehand. I lost a pound of the meat purchase just from that and it takes a little cutting to get to the slowcooker!",
