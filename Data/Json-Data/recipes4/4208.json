I took it out of the marinade, dried it off and slathered it with fresh ground black pepper and fresh ground sea salt (I don't use much salt) thyme, rosemary, arrow root, onion and garlic powder some whole grain mustard and some tomato paste.  I put oil in the hot pot and browned all sides of the roast.  I took the roast out of the pot, saut\u00e9ed some scallion, celery and fresh garlic.  I put in the potatoes and carrots and let them get a little color, not much really.  I then put the meat and a mix of Guinness and low sodium free range organic chicken stock and a bay leaf some flour and a little brown sugar.  I put the lid on and an hour later we had a VERY TENDER delicious roast, I probably didn't use enough flour as the sauce didn't thicken, but it was delicious.  I think what took the longest was chopping the veggies.",
