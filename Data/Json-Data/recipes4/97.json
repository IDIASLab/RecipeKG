Then I added the potatoes & rosemary, salt & pepper then cooked for about 10 minutes on the stove before placing in the oven.  At the end of the baking time, I broiled them for a few minutes so they were nice and crispy.  A huge hit!",

I ended up having to pour off all the oil transfer them to a cookie sheet and put them under the broiler for a few minutes in order to get them to brown. The rosemary flavor was nice. Way way too oily for my taste but if you like oily things you might like it.",

I don't know if this was because of the stoneware or the butter though.  this was the first time I used a stoneware pan to make potatoes.
