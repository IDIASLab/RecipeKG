Thickened up and seasoned properly this will be great! You can even add some cooked white rice to thicken it up. It would be more filling too!",

These adjustments worked well for me: substituted vegetable broth for the water and only used about two and a half cups of it - I like a thick puree. I'd definitely recommend adding some salsa (1/2 - 1 cup) for some extra flavor when adding the beans. Topped it off with a little sour cream and some green onions. With some tweaking you can get some great flavors out of this soup!",
