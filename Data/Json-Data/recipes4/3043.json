I was a bit concerned when making this because the flour/butter roux mixture was VERY thick and then when I added the shredded cheese to it it got even thicker. Not to worry because once it baked in the oven it turned out fabulous!!!!!! It was creamy and luscious and the potato cheese flavors were just right! My family loved it!!! I made only one small change to this recipe. I used diced hash browns (thawed) instead of going through the extra time and work of cooking potatoes. I will be making this dish often!!!!!",

However, they were filling, something different, and I liked the cubed texture. I ended up adding a little garlic salt at the end, to add a little more flavor, as my only change. On the other hand, they are very time-consuming. Cook time alone is 1 hour and 20 minutes. That is more cook time than I will typically spend on a holiday side dish. Also, 14 small potatoes is slightly misleading. That will result in different outcomes. I would have just listed the amount of cups of cubed potatoes with the approximate amount of potatoes needed. I baked this in a 13x9 pan lined with thick foil and sprayed with PAM. Made clean-up super easy. A little heavy and time-consuming, so not a repeat dish, but I used up a lot of leftover potatoes.",
