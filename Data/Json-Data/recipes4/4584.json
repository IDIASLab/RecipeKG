I did not use the parsnips because we don't care for them but other than that I made it as directed. The only negative is the color. With the white apples potatoes and chicken the only other color was the orange carrots and a little bit of green (parsley). It would have more visual appeal if there were more green maybe. Perhaps some spinach or green beans? I don't know if they would change the taste though. Bottom line is that I will make it again. It's a keeper.",

I made this dish for a special event with some friends and it fell flatter than a pancake under a 20 ton weight. It was actually going along fairly well until I added the tablespoon of cider vingegar - which changed the entire flavor of the dish. And there was no real recovery after that because I didn't have time to mess with it. The texture was mushy and the flavor was uninspired. Some suggestions I would offer are these: Substitute Jerusalem artichokes for potatoes (much more expensive I know but better for diabetics) and add a handful of dried cranberries to sweeten it up. This recipe needs to focus on being on the sweeter side with the use of apples and apple cider but like other reviewers have mentioned it doesn't quite go there (but it should). This recipe sends mixed flavor messages in my view. You can pick this up just by reading the recipe.",

I let those boil whole in the soup until fully cooked then shredded and added it back to the soup. I replaced the fresh parsley with dried (that's what I had) and increased the garlic to 2 cloves. Omitted the celery and parsnips, opting for extra carrots, 1 more apple, 1 more potato. Used a yellow onion. The soup is little on the sweet side, which can easily be remedied by using less apple cider and more stock, or using a little hard apple cider with stock instead. I like the tang from the vinegar. I did mash up the potatoes a bit to thicken, and would probably use a few more next time to really make this a stew, as in it's current state it's more like a soup.",

This alone has some odd things that just do not pair together as it stands it needs to have a balance of savory and sweet and this is not it. If you followed these directions you would end up with a soupy mess with odd ball flavor contrasts. This is what I did since I just received about 48 red apples a couple days ago I cut them up and froze them. I made a base boiling 4 chicken thighs in a pot of water then when cooked through took them out to cut the meat off. I seasoned the water with a tablespoon of soy sauce and then added chicken bouillon till it tasted right. I diced up some baby carrots and a handful of broccoli tossed it in with the diced chicken. I then made some traditional dumplings and added in two tablespoons of corn starch whisked in a half cup of water to thicken it. I added in two cups of diced apples and boiled it for 45 minutes to soften the apples and cook the dumplings. added salt and pepper to taste and it came out great. Why would you add in vinegar? of any kind? that would completely destroy the delicate balance of the sweet and savory! Sweet and Savory not Sweet and Sour!",
