Plus the bread still has a nice flavor.\n And Most Important:\n\nUse San Marzano Tomantoes instead of Romas... they have much more flavor and are Sweeter than romas. This really gets your taste buds going with the contradictions of flavors. If you can grow and use them from your garden, Even better!\n\nIf you want mini pizzas: do the MooseArella thingy.\n\nI have read many variations and all are very good!",

So I added a splash of Balsamic Vinegar some red pepper flakes salt & freshly ground black pepper. We used fresh basil & may consider adding some onion next time. This is a great basic recipe that you can customize to your desire. You can add fresh herbs (oregano parsley rosemary etc.) different cheeses (Romano Asiago) etc. Have fun with it.
