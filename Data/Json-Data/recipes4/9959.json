This way the strawberries get a coat really well.  I also have used less strawberries and add slices bananas which is great for a change.  And it is also good using raspberry gelatin.",

First you get out of something what you put into it and if it sounds too good to be true it probably is. I arranged my beautiful strawberries in a lovely concentric pattern in a pretty white quiche dish. I was fairly confident at this point thinking this was going to be one pretty dessert. I mixed up and cooked the pudding/gelatin mixture as the recipe directed using the indicated cook-and-serve sugar free pudding and sugar free gelatin. It was already so thick I had to carefully smear it over the strawberries. At this point I m still hoping for the best but it s not looking good. The recipe indicates to chill this 4-6 hours. Are you kidding me? An hour later I had it cut and plopped on a dessert plate like a brick. The filling was thick congealed and rubbery not pudding-like or custard-like at all. If you can get passed the weird and unbecoming look color and consistency of this you won t be able to get passed the artificial taste or the acrid aftertaste presumably by an overabundance of sugar-free stuff. Whipped cream helped that somewhat but seriously should you need to mask the taste of your dessert? I m reluctantly giving this two stars rather than one only because the whipped cream made it edible. I so wish I could have my beautiful strawberries back.",
