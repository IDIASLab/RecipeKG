I also added goat cheese to the salad as the peppery taste of arugula really compliments the cheese well. I used good balsamic vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. Instead of greek dressing I just used a simple balsamic vinegar olive oil salt and pepper dressing. Fantastic!",

I roasted my own peppers and made the Greek dressing (olive oil red wine vinegar dijon mustard garlic and fresh oregano and basil). Once it was baked I chopped the mushroom and tossed everything with the arugula to wilt the greens slightly. I didn't use the cheese and it didn't seem to be lacking. I think feta would be a great complement along with some pine nuts.",
