To ensure the full flavour is achieved it might be wise to not overly dilute. If possible use chicken stock rather than water should you decide to do so. Any extra liquid above what the recipe calls for should be added in small quantities. Taste as you go. I hope you like it. Enjoy!",

I loved the procedure of this recipe but found it severely lacking the turkey flavor that I wanted. It tasted watery. Using all chicken broth would have helped a lot. When I added in the tomato paste I got an unwanted distinct tomato flavor instead of blending in as I was hoping. Ultimately I had to add in a turkey gravy packet (which I despise doing) sage thyme pepper and a fair bit of salt. In spite of all of that I liked the procedure so well that I think I will use parts of this recipe again. I will definitely using only chicken broth instead of water. I will add in sage and thyme and half of the tomato paste and jelly.",
