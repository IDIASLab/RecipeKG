I made my sauce from the Knorr dried Alfredo sauce packages, and used half milk & half 1/2 & 1/2 to make it richer.  I also added some grated fresh Parmesan.  \n\nIt was difficult finding lobster here (expensive & frozen), so I opted for some lobster, large shrimp and crab.\n\nDon't hesitate on making this.

Perhaps I interpreted the amount of lobster wrong. But to me (a New Englander all my life)  2lb of cooked lobster meat does not include the weight of the shell. I did make it for guests and it is absolutely devine. Everyone loved it!! Brilliant recipe!!!  however it will take you to the bank. ",

The tails we had didn't quite equal two pounds (in fact the meat we got was closer to one pound) so I added a can of salmon and some canned mushrooms to make up the difference. Outstanding! Although I only used 9 lasagna noodles rather than the 16 called for. Thank you for inventing this! A side note... the lasagna looks HUGE when you put it in the oven but don't worry... the spinach cooks down a lot.",

I found that there was not enough ricotta to make 3 layers so I would recommend using more of the ricotta mixture but much less of the shredded cheeses. I used jarred Alfredo sauce but I think it would be much better with homemade Alfredo. Very rich & filling.  Too much cheese, even for lasagna.  I think I will stick to Lazyman Lobster with leftovers. Family did not like.  Ended up throwing away the entire leftover casserole dish the next day!
