I made this 2x (husb birthday dinner) second time was even better because I added a little more seasoning to the flour mixture (ie. chicken soup mix more garlic & salt). I added seltzer instead of water but I know my mom-in-law makes it with beer instead of water. That gives it a tampura kind of taste-YUM! I also \"double dipped\" the mushroom: egg flour egg flour- I think this gave it more crispy crunch. Trick is to serve it RIGHT AWAY! Make sure to serve it warm or else it ruins the taste &crunch. Try it with cauliflower too. Do you know how much this costs in a resturant????!!!!",
