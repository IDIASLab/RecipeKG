Also, add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon of freshly ground nutmeg to the roux. This is standard for a white sauce.\n6. Use light cheese for the topping, preferably highly flavored such as asiago or extra sharp cheddar.",

If you are used to canned soup tuna casserole, and you try this recipe, you will NEVER go back. \nI changed very few things and just finished this for dinner.  I didn't add mushrooms (not a fan), and added just a sprinkle of celery seed.\nI also used a little more cheese, more like a 1 1/4 cup of cheese.  I added half of the cheese to the \"cream\" and melted it like you would do with macaroni and cheese.  Then added the other half to the top like the recipe called for.\nI read other reviews mention the use of crackers instead of bread crumbs, and I did that as well.  \nThis recipe is going into the keep pile, THANKS!",

I cooked that for about 3-5 minutes and then added the milk.  After the noodles cooked for 4 minutes, I added the frozen peas to the pot and cooked the peas and noodles together for another 4 minutes.  After draining both, I put the tuna in the noodle pot, poured the noodles and peas on top, added the cheese and stirred.  Then I added the mushroom mix, stirred and put it all in a casserole dish.  I omitted the salt from the recipe and topped the casserole with crushed potato chips as I didn't have bread crumbs.  I love recipes that don't include a \"cream of something\" can of soup!

My husband did comment that it doesn't have the typical soup taste to it, which is a great thing!\n4-11-06:  I made this again tonight, and it was a lot better!  I added some fresh dill, as dill is really good paired with just about any fish.  I also tripled the amounts of garlic and black pepper that went into it; it was very flavorful this time around.

I should have stopped there and eaten the dish as pasta with tuna sauce. The baking dried it out completely. I would also suggest using more tuna as to me it tasted more like a 'peas in white sauce with pasta casserole'. I am also always suspicious when recipes call for a flour-thickened sauce to put over pasta. They ususally turn out too 'bready'. I think it would be nicer to use thick cream instead of milk here, and omit the flour. Also, more spices and herbs would be nice, I think. Garlic, parsley and lemon would make it more interesting. The way it's written it's a bit bland and definitely dry and I am not looking forward to finishing the leftovers tomorrow night.",
