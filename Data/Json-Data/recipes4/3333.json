I'll make this again, with these small changes, from the recipe & from what I did: add a little more cayenne & perhaps ginger (both of which I couldn't taste); add 1-2 teasp. brown sugar for a sweetening & caramelizing effect; marinate 2 hrs.; sprinkle med. coarse sea salt on the skin (of fillet) just before grilling; and cook on a MED. grill as recipe indicates.  What happened this time was I marinated for 4 hrs. and cooked it on a med.-low heat, when recipe asked for marinating 1 hour  & grilling on MED. heat; these 2 factors led to a slightly too-dry salmon! So, I need to make this again.",

I added just a pinch of red pepper flakes, and in the future I would also add a pinch of salt - but this is personal preference. Started cooking skin side down (oven under broiler, got rained out), flipped and poured remaining marinade over, and finished cooking. Now the confession - I didn't use salmon. I used chicken thighs! It would be phenomenal on salmon. If you really want a lime kick, squeeze some freeze juice on top of your plate. Mmmmm. Thanks!",
