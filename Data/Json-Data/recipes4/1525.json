So I cooked them in the crock pot with other ing. on low for about two hour checking to make sure they did not start falling apart.  I then drained grease from crockpot and let the ribs rest on paper towels for about 30 minutes while getting the grill ready.  When the grill was hot we cooked them for about eight minutes, four minutes on each side and brushed them with BBQ sauce, I then added them back to crockpot with BBQ sauce and we used Miller beer.  Make sure you use a good BBQ sauce like Jack Daniels, Famous Daves, etc.  if you use the cheap brands like kraft etc. you will not get the full flavor of BBQ.  These turned out finger lickin, fall of the bone, drop dead good.  Thanks for the post.",

                "reviewBody": "Fantastic. I followed all three steps of the cooking process. After reading all of the reviews it appeared to me that some were having a tough time BBQ'ing the ribs without burning them. I think that the reason is two-fold. First and probably the main reason for this was the use of far to much BBQ sauce. The ribs should only be lightly coated. Second when cooking the ribs you should not place them over the direct flame of the BBQ. High heat and high flame are two different things. For example on a four burner gas BBQ you can maintain 350 degrees by putting two burners on high and two on low. With this you can cook your ribs over the low flame and get that fire taste.",

Babyback ribs are used by the food industry as it is easier to control portion size, not for their flavor. Smoke them over 220 heat for two hours and if inclined, sauce them and wrap them in foil for one more hour. Trust me,I cooked in a bbq joint in Lubbock Texas..  I do not lie",
