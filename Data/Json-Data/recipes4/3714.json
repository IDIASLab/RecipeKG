You can really make this according to your preference: I used 16 oz whole-wheat fusilli omitted the broccoli and onion roasted my own peppers and made my own Greek dressing (red-wine vinegar olive oil garlic Dijon mustard and fresh oregano). A great combination of veggies with lots of contrasting textures and vibrant flavors! It makes a ton but as with any pasta salad it's better the longer it sits. Can't wait to try this with avocados! UPDATE: The avocados added a nice creamy texture but not much flavor. I think I'd rather just chop them up and mix them in with the rest of the veggies.",
