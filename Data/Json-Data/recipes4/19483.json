The only thing I did differently was to replace a cup of the water with some fresh chicken broth that I had left from cooking some thighs yesterday. We enjoyed this curry but felt it was a bit salty. In the future I ll use all chicken broth (no water) eliminate the chicken bouillon granules and replace the garlic salt with garlic powder. Michelle thanks for sharing your recipe we enjoyed it.",

It seems really \"watery\" at first. but as it cooked, it thickened up. If I were to change anything, It would be to add coconut milk. I think it would make it richer, and creamier. It would also take some of the bite out of the curry.",

Quick for an easy weeknight meal, or works as a slightly fancier meal for guests that is a little unique. I debated about using green peppers since I know my kids, 12, 8, and 7 aren\u2019t huge fans, but since this was the first time making this I wanted to follow the recipe exactly. Next time I might use a combination of peppers to get more color and some different flavors. Thank you for sharing your recipe!",
