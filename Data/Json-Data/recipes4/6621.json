It turned out surprisingly well.  Usually we cook with a lot of spices, but we just added some ground pepper to the top and my husband and I both went back for seconds.  \n\nMy one comment about the instructions was that I did not know whether to bake it with the lid on or off, and tried with the lid on.  In 50 minutes, the casserole hadn't set, so I had to bake it another 20 with the lid off.  I think in the future I would try this recipe with shredded potatoes rather than rice, just for the texture.  \n\nThanks for sharing, BABYPHAT55!",
