I needed to use up an opened box of elbow macaroni and found this 'recipe for one.' This mac-n-cheese recipe was absolutely delicious. Loved the flavor and texture - very creamy. Some 'scratch' mac-n-cheese recipes seem to require too much flour or baking time and the texture can be very grainy. Not this one!  Only changes - I omitted the worcestorshire and used a little extra cheese on top. Now, I just need to scale the recipe to serve several people and I will proudly prepare it for our next family gathering. Yummy!!!",

I pretty much followed the recipe except I baked it longer and at 425 degrees because I like my mac & cheese browned on the bottom and edges.  The recipe isn't real cheesy but the onion powder and other spices gives it a nice flavor boost.  Just taste the cheese sauce before adding the macaroni and if it isn't cheesy enough, just add more.  I'm counting calories so I thought it was just right.  I used panko breadcrumbs which always add a nice crunch. As I was eating, I thought about adding a little chopped broccoli to the dish when I make it again for a quick broccoli mac & cheese dish.  I baked it in one of my mini au gratin dishes, and it fit perfectly.  A really nice recipe that I will make again.",

I don't have mac and cheese often and on the rare occasions I do none of the homemade recipes I've tried have ever held a candle to that boxed stuff and this recipe was no exception. The flavor was okay - I used a mix of mild cheddar (for creaminess),  sharp Cheddar and Gruyere (for flavor), and skipped the bread crumbs. But I have to agree with \"love my kids\" who commented she'd add more macaroni in the future. There was just too much heavy sauce which totally overwhelmed the macaroni.

                "reviewBody": "Awesome! I get a hankering for mac and cheese every once in a while and BF detests it (what's wrong with him?!?!) so I can never make it for dinner. I make this for myself for lunch now to cure my craving. Any pasta will do really penne/ziti is actually my fave but I use whatever's on hand. I adjust if a bit by adding a sprinkle of smoked paprika and prefer to use a non-vinegary hot sauce not tabasco for this one. Instead of breadcrumbs I sprinkle french fried onions on top then the cheese and bake... SO GOOD!!! Be sure as with any roux based sauce that you let it thicken properly (before adding the cheese) otherwise you will end up with it 'soupy' as one reviewer described... Use the 2 minutes as a guideline but if it's still thin give it another minute or 2 til it looks right. Would definately scale this up and serve to guests especially around the holidays! UPDATE: I now use the cheesy sauce (double amts) in my tuna casserole and it's AWESOME... try it! DOUBLE UPDATE: I don't suggest making this ahead of time... I scaled it up and made it an hour or so before baking and it wasn't as smooth as it is when you bake it right away the sauce kind of starts to coagulate... I did however adapt the recipe to be gluten free for a friend with celiacs by using brown rice macaroni and white rice flour (just know that a gluten free roux is thinner but it bakes up ok in the end). She said it was really good and hadn't been able to have mac N cheese for a looong time.",

Thank you cody's mama for posting ur pic- which made me try this recipe. My first successful roux. I followed the recipe pretty closely only changes were to double the recipe (kept baking time the same) and replaced bread crumbs with Ritz crumbs. The pasta-to-sauce ratio was perfect i like my pasta slightly drowning in sauce. Some of the ingredients (worchestershire and hot sauce) might sound weird for a mac n cheese recipe but they actually help this one stand out (in a good way) without being too bold. but it does give it a more grown-up taste. for a more traditional taste i would omit the sauces (and maybe even the mustard) and add more cheese. The reviewer who found it too salty might have used salted butter. thanks amydoll for this recipe!",
