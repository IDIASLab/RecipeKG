This made the final product a little too wet. I didn't take into account that the sour cream & cottage cheese would add additional liquid. I kept the dish loosely covered with foil for half the baking time because I don't like for the cheese to get overly browned too quickly. I uncovered it for the last 20 min. Everyone loved this dish and had seconds. Although we all loved it... I feel like it needs a little more seasoning. Next time I think I will mix in some Italian seasoning salt and pepper into the cottage cheese mixture. Great way to use leftover spaghetti. I think I will start making extra spaghetti ON PURPOSE and put in freezer so I can make this dish the following week.",

I don't like ricotta (which most people probably would have added instead), so I added some cottage cheese. It wasn't quite creamy enough, so then I added some sour cream as well. It turned out amazing and everyone LOVED it so I've been making it this way ever since. It's just funny because I thought \"I\" made up this recipe on my own LOL:)It's really very delicious!!!",

I did add an egg to the cheese mixture and a layer of pepperoni (instead of the author's suggested sausage which I'll try next time) but it would have still been amazing either way---the brilliant sour cream-cottage cheese mixture really ties the dish together. Seriously try this recipe it could be a new favorite for you and yours. And if your spaghetti is all dry and gross here's how to make it tasty again.",

I don't recall this recipe saying it was was authentic anything??  This is a recipe utilizing leftovers.  It is what it is, and it is wonderful.\n\nYes having married into an Italian family I wondered about the filling too.   And all I have to say is I LOVE IT and will probably swap it for the typical bland ricotta I usually use in my Italian cooking.   I added a little parmesan and some Italian seasoning to it.  It was WONDERFUL!\n\nI keep my own homemade sauce in the freezer in great proportions so I used that.   I did follow the \"tip\" and put Italian sausage on the bottom prior to layering.\n\nRegardless, I love this concept and i LOVE LOVE the cottage cheese/sour cream filling!    \n\nThank you for posting this recipe!  I will most definitely prepare it again and again!",
