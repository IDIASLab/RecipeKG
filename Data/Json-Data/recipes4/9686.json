Cut the thyme and add 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped cilantro 2 tsp paprika 1/4 tsp. curry powder and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. Increase the buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups. Garnish with cilantro and sour cream instead of chives. Brilliant. This had a great color and consistency. I expected a more earthy filling quality but it's even better the next morning. You could make it entirely vegetarian by using vegetable broth. Oh I forgot to mention that I do this in the slow cooker: Peel and chop your root veggies and let them cook in the broth on high for 4-6 hours. Reduce the heat to LOW add the spices and buttermilk and cook for another hour. Use an immersion blender to pur\u00e9e it all. It's easier than transferring it to a traditional blender",

I made a few changes to start -- I upped the number of sweet potatoes to 4 and regular potatoes to about 2.5. I used regular baking potatoes but I think Yukons might work better next time. Along with the onions and garlic I sauteed about a 1/3 cup carrots. I decreased the water to 6 cups and made up the difference with chicken stock. After the spices were added I also added about 3/4 cup brown sugar (slightly too much) about 1 generous tablespoon cinnamon and a full pint of lowfat buttermilk. While the spices do give this dish a zing the sweet potato flavor is sorely lacking. I will likely up the number of sweet potatoes next time to 5 or 6 and definitely cut back on the amount of regular potatoes nutmeg and thyme as they were a bit overpowering.",

Added a little brown sugar at the end. It was just sweet and spicy enough for us. I think the buttermilk was the only thing i kept and it was good.
