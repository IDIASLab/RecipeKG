They are delicious, easy to make, and can be customized to your own tastes. I not only use the recipe as a delicious grab-and-go breakfast, but serve it to guests nestled into some lovely cheese grits, alongside fresh fruits and French toast made on a panini press. Oh, and don't forget the mimosas!",

I would suggest baking these in disposable cupcake liners, they will slide right out and the clean up is a breeze.  I halved the recipe and instead of frozen hash browns I grated 3 medium russet potatoes with the food processor and placed the grated potato into a salad spinner.  Rinsed the potatoes well in cool water and spun them dry.  Next time I will build the sides of the nests a little higher.  Overall, this is a solid recipe to which you can add anything you would like to customize these to your families taste.",

So, I left the first half in the tin until the next morning and went ahead with the rest of the recipe. Slightly easier to get out with the egg making the cups a more solid mass to get a spoon under...the potatoes did not crisp up like I'd hoped, except the top edge. I did cut the salt in half per other reviews, and I used Canadian bacon (my favorite breakfast meat!). Worrying about the cups sticking, I used 3 T oil in the potato mixture, and used a pastry brush and veggie oil to thoroughly grease my muffin cups. Having some trouble getting my muffin pan clean now, so I am tempted to take the rest of the potato mixture and slap it in a pie plate...thanks for the idea but this just didn't work for me! Update: used the rest of the ingredients to make an 'eagle's nest' in my Pyrex pie plate and it worked much better :)",

I used my square cupcake pans and got exactly 24.  So for me, the serving size was spot on.  I used ham on some and bacon on some. I added diced onion and peppers to the mix.  The taste was great, and they reheated great in the microwave.  The downside was - how they stick to the pan.  The pans I used are coated so that you do not have to spray them and my foods have always come out.  Reading other reviews how they stuck to the pans - I very heavily sprayed with cooking spray.  Oh, what a mess!  They did not release from the pan, and the pans were a bear to clean.  If I make them again, I will use foil cupcake liners that are sprayed first.  Sticking issues aside, remember they have great flavor, love that you can customize and reheat wonderfully.",

I also saute some onions and then cook the meat in with those for additional flavor. I typically use more than the recommended amount of meat I would suggest 1 1/2 pounds of sausage and at least a pound of bacon (8 or 9 slices of thick cut). I've read several complaints about sticking I've never had this problem. I use the Pampered Chef individual brownie pan without liners and generously apply cooking spray. I start with hash browns frozen and after \"pre-cooking\" them I press them down with the back of a large spoon. After the final bake I run a butter knife around the edge and they slide right out. I typically get 24 nests which I package in two's in sandwich bags. They can be warmed in 30-45 seconds in an 1100 watt microwave for a hearty on the go breakfast.",
