But we still liked it.\" This recipe goes by several different names the one I'm most familiar w/ is Low Country Boil where you dump the pot out onto a newspaper-covered table and just attack it w/ a crowd. I made this version exactly as written only we ladled some of the juice into our bowls for dragging hunks of crusty bread through. We did find to our disappointment that it was really low on the flavor spectrum and that 1 1/2 pinches (pinches!) of salt and 2 tsp. of Old Bay weren't nearly enough for all of that water and ingredients. So we had to add Texas Pete and more salt at the table. It's a recipe that I always enjoy eating and it would've been perfect if it just hadn't required additional seasoning and sauces at serving.",
