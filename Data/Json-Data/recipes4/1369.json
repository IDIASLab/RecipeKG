Lastly I added 1 cup of water to the stuffing so that it would be moist. I cooked it for 30 minutes covered removed the cover and cooked an additional 15-20 minutes.

I couldn't imagine that you would not prepare the stuffing in advance however the directions did not ask to do so. Fortunately I do read all reviews and apparently others felt the same as I so I did make the stuffing on top of the stove first. This would as other reviewers stated to be quite a salty dish so I used \"healthy\" cream of chicken soup. Others said that the dish was rather bland so I not only seasoned my chicken but also the soup to which I used beer and not wine (I was out). To make it more interesting I sauteed onions and portabello mushrooms and added that to the layers on top of the chicken. Not a lot of changes here but just a few things to enhance the dish. All in all Ashbeth this is a very good recipe that my whole family truly loved. Thanks so much!",

The dish turned out great and my wife and daughter love it! Thanks! Here are a couple of changes I tried: 1. I cut the chicken into small strips. That made it easier to serve (especially for children). It also helped when checking to see if the chicken was cooked by pulling out a small piece. I also used 12 pieces rather than 8 so we could eat it for two nights. 2. I sauteed 1/2 onion 3 table spoons minced garlic 5 mushrooms parsley and oregano in about 1/2 cup of butter. Then I spread that over the chicken. Next time my wife suggested that I could even marinate the chicken in the sautee for a while. 3. I used about 5-6oz of wine because of the other reviews. But I didn't really taste it. I might use about 8-9oz next time. 4. I used 2 slices of cheese over each breast. Again I didn't realy taste it. I think I might go with 3 next time. 5. I used too much cream of chicken soup (about 30oz). The dish was a little too liquidy. Next time I'll probably use about 20oz. Thanks again!",
