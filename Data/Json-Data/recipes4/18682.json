        "description": "Dahl puri is an East Indian-style flatbread stuffed with delicious seasoned yellow split peas. This bread is popular in both Suriname and Guyana, and the local scotch bonnet chile pepper gives it a touch of Caribbean flavor. This bread is often served with curry dishes, such as aloo curry (curried potatoes), another Indian dish that is popular in the Caribbean. I have always loved this dish growing up and still do. Brush roti with melted butter before serving, if desired.",
