This reminds me a bit of the Malaysian style of adding evaporated milk or condensed milk to coffee (my mother's country) although she says you can't replicate the aunthentic coffee shop style she grew up with of course. I follwed this recipe for single serving and used 2 Tablespoons Illy decaf ground espresso in a one cup melitta filter with 1/8 of the cardamom. So I agree with the reviewer who said make the coffee very strong so it can handle the condensed milk which is great. The cardamom not too overpowering. I drank it hot but I'm sure it would be great on ice too. Thank you!",

It's only about 50% coffee that's cut with and roasted with noncoffee substitutes corn soy and sesame. It's supposed to be really really strong so I made a pot of coffee with chicory in it put it back into the coffeemaker with fresh grinds in the basket and added 1/2 teaspoon each of ground corriander and cardamom. I mixed in the condensed milk and poured it over ice and served it cold. It was good and VERY rich (enjoy this slowly--trust me!) but I still like the real stuff I get from my bean shop better.
