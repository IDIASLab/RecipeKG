Didn\u2019t measure, just eyeballed everything, but cut back on the butter which is something I\u2019ve never included before.  Our family always added corn, so I did throw in a handful of frozen Birdseye\u00ae Baby Gold & White Corn.  Also, since ham is loaded with sodium, I didn't add any salt, but did season with  pepper toward the end of cooking.   For me, this is just good, old-fashioned comfort food, and I always serve it with cornbread and a garnish of freshly-chopped onions.",
