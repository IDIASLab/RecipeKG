Otherwise this was tasty if you have the ingredients around but not really something I'll go buy that dressing for again. The sauce while tasty isn't enough to use over rice and I also doubled it. It looked like it was going to be enough but after about 20 mins waiting for the hubs to get home the sauce reduced or congealed or something and wasn't enough for the rice. This has the potential to be really tasty however and the directions were very clear and easy to follow. All in all glad I gave it a shot:-) Thanks!",
