When I make them at my home here in America, I just use regular vegetable oil.\nFew pointers: Don't skip or substitute the marjoram, I actually add way more then just a pinch. Also add lots of pepper and especially salt. Potatoes tend to soak up the salt flavor quite a bit. Lets face it, this is not a healthy meal to begin with, so you might as well make it right. Like Sonya recommends, fry up and taste the first pancake, it should have a nice salty/garlicky flavor. Even tho I've made these many times, it usually takes me more then one trial pancake to get the flavor right.\nWhen my mom made these, it was the one time we didn't actually have a sit down family dinner. We would just sneak them right when they were done and she ate as she was making them. They just taste the best when they're nice and hot right out of the frying pan!",

I've tried many recipes and mixes, but couldn't get the taste, texture and crisp. I would use onions and it would always come out a little too moist and dense.  Thank you! I finally got crisp potato pancakes, flavorful with the caraway seeds and marjoram.  We decided to use this liquid creme fraiche that we had in fridge instead of milk.  Served it with some homemade rum spiced apple compote and a nice blonde beer . I really dug the caraway seed flavor it added, and as you mentioned the beer! Oh I thought I 'd share this with you since you mentioned Korea and potato pancakes, my mom would make it with green onions, shredded carrots and dried cod. Yum!",
