I did use jarred minced garlic instead of fresh - I spread about 1/4-1/2 tsp on each breast. Instead of fresh tomatoes I used half a can of diced tomatoes with most of the juice drained. Otherwise I made the recipe as stated with spice amounts and cooking method. Make sure to not overcook the chicken after you uncover it otherwise it will be too dry. Ours turned out moist and yummy! My poor daughter did get a bite with a bunch of red pepper - oops! My husband and I loved the spice though. The liberal seasoning is the key to this recipe to keep it from being bland. Next time I make this I may marinate the chicken in a little Italian dressing first. Definitely a keeper!",

I dunno.\" I followed the recipe exactly (mincing garlic instead of slicing) and while the chicken was extra-juicy and tender the flavor just didn't do it for me or well the lack of more flavor. Yes it's super-easy and definitely a healthy dish (maybe I should've taken all the reviewers' suggestion of topping w/ mozzarella thereby decreasing the healthy factor?) but wow chicken that isn't browned 1st just looks so pale and wiggly on a plate. If I made this recipe again I would definitely brown the chicken first and maybe mix fresh herbs instead of dried w/ olive oil and brush it on while it bakes. Still for the ease of preparation it wasn't terrible just sorta \"yawn.\"",
