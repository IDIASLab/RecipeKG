Flavor was mild I was respecting more robust but maybe that s just me. I ended up adding chicken broth to aid in dryness probably triple the suit and fish sauce. Added straight prepared horseradish for extra heat as that was on hand. Will make again and attempt to perfect! After showing to reheat and rest after adding broth was super good.",

I let the dish sit on the stove top for an hour or two before adding all the peanuts so they wouldn't absorb too much liquid. It was fantastic even better cold. Perfect dish to make for other people when you can't all eat right away while it's hot. Without the rice vinegar I don't know if it would be as good cold.",
