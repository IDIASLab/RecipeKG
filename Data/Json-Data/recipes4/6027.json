I wondered if there was an error in the amount of oil.  I tried to cook down the sauce after removing the chicken, but that didn't really work.  The chicken itself turned out moist and tasty, but I had to dunk the leftovers in Trader Joe's Sweet Chili Sauce (a nice complement).  I think I will try this again using only a tablespoon or so of oil and orange juice concentrate----or maybe the orange juice, a little oil, and Dijon mustard.  I'll give it another try!  Sorry about my review!",
