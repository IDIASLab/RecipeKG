Since I only had two other eggs at home I had to improvise because my pasta wasn't really floating. So I added heavy cream. Not perfect but it worked well so I don't think it came out the way it was supposed to still delicious. I also used more cheese but I didn't measure it. I just shredded what I had left of my Romano wedge:) I'd definitely make this again (using the right eggs and no cream).",
