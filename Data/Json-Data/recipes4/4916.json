It uses way too much oil. If I make this again I will probably cut the oil in half to 1/3 cup and skip the first browning of garlic step as I didnt feel it did anything. I would just add all 3 cloves of garlic at the same time as I add the broccoli rabe. As far as the flavor it really seemed to be missing something like 1 tsp of italian seasoning. If I make this again I will rerate it.",

I read the other two reviews and CNM Catering is right this recipe calls for too much oil. I looked at the submitter's original recipe and it requires only 6 Tbsp of oil. So the five stars is for the original version. I asked around the Buzz and a bunch of cooked broccoli rabe is about 450 grams and a 15 oz. can of garbanzo beans weighs about 8 oz give or take. So I made it using the original amount of oil (6 Tbsp) and it came out crsip and delicious. Make sure you drain the broccoli very well because mine got a bit soupy and I had to cook it off which over-cooked my broccoli. The amount of hot peppers depends on your liking but a kick is necesary. I topped with parmigiano reggaino. Typically served with sausage it also goes well with veal pork or lamb chops. Thank you Tomn for submitting this tasty dish.",
