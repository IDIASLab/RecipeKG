Instead, double the ingredients in step 3 (I would add 1 and 1/2 cups of shitakes) and then brown.  Remove once brown to avoid seperating.  I also only cooked the meat in the oven for six minutes then transferred to warm plate, wrapped the filets in tin foil and covered with a towel to let cook the rest of the way while I finished sauce.  Ended up an absolute perfect buttery medium rare!  I can't wait for the next dinner party to serve this!!!",

I followed the recipe exactly except that I cut down on the butter a bit in the first step and used some garlic olive oil instead (the butter later in the recipe made up for this no problem). I personally would recommend using Mirin and sake and not subbing it for something else-- that sweet subtle flavor can't be found anywhere else. But if you're looking for sake and mirin don't go to the liquor store. Mirin is a COOKING wine and thus would be found in your local grocery store (or Asian food store) in the cooking wine and/or asian food section. Sake should be with all other wines and beers. Worth the extra hunt in the grocery store because this recipe is so yummy we ate every last bite!",
