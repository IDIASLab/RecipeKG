If yellow beets are available, double the recipe using a bunch of red and a bunch of yellow -- gorgeous!  My brother spent 50 years hating beets, but he loves them prepared this way.  I think these go especially well with pork or chicken.  This recipe can easily be doubled, tripled, or expanded to whatever amount you need without adding very much to the preparation time.",

For those of you who complained that the beets were hard to peel here's a little trick. When the beets are done roasting in the oven wrap them in aluminum foil to let them cool. The foil holds in just the right amount of steam. When you open them up put on some rubber gloves and just rub the skin off right over the trashcan. I also leave the gloves on when slicing them up.
