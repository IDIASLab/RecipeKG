My only gripe is that my batch turned out a bit runny and has more the consistency of the icing you'd find on cinnamon buns. I added a lot of extra powdered sugar and still couldn't get it to stiffen quite right. I'm tossing it in the fridge to cool down before trying to crumb coat with it. For those wanting a truly yummy chai flavor might I suggest trying to work with the powdered chai mix from Tasteful Simply? It's called Oh My! Chai and has been my absolute favorite chai of all of the various brands I've tasted. The fact that it is a powdered mix instead of tea bags might work to the advantage of stiffening the mix a bit too. I would have used it today but alas I am out. - I am willing to give this recipe another try.",

The recipe itself is huge and i think the proportions were off a little bit for the thickness i wanted for my cookies.
