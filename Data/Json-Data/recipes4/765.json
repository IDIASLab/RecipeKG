She had tried to make Dolmas herself but never turned out this good! They were a big hit. Another guest that will not eat ANYTHING green was spotted picking the stuffing out of the leaves! Could not find any currants so left them out. Was told later that I could have used white grape raisins (so try that if you too have trouble finding currants) Prepared stuffing and rolled dolmas the night before. I had never worked with grape leaves. First I thought I could just pull them out one at a time (like a can of baby wipes) but finally figured out that you had to work the whole bundle out of the jar then unroll it. Also I thought I would have plenty of extra leaves because it was a jar of 50 but as it turns out there were many that had holes in them or were badly torn and not useable (so buy plenty extra!). I served them hot out of the steamer. I used a electric steamer for 45 mins separating the layers of the dolmas with a little parchment paper (in hindsight not sure if that was necessary as they did not seem to stick to each other or the steamer at all) I did not do the lemon juice thing because when I have them at Greek restaurants I always think they have just a bit too much 'tang'. It was awesome easy and quite the crowd pleaser (as noted by other reviewers). Highly recommend it A",

The reviews were tremendous whether from the few people who had had dolmas before or the vast majority utterly unfamiliar with them. I am providing the recipe (actually a link to it) to probably 10 people. (Another half dozen people took the left-overs home.) Although this is not a typical American party food I highly recommend it for that very purpose. It was surprisingly easy to make well-appreciated by both the meat-eaters and vegetarians in the crowd and offered a novel diversion from the \"typical\" potluck food. Although the ingredients sound hard to find all were available at my local grocery store (Thriftway)--I actually tried Trader Joes first but they didn't have grape leaves or dried currants.",
