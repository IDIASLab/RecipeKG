I was a little concerned that this was going to be labor intensive but it only took about 10 minutes to prepare. I just sliced the zucchini in rounds, and then I dunked them in Egg Beaters to save on calories and for the convenience, and then dunked them in the bread crumb mixture.  I used seasoned bread crumbs and added extra garlic powder since my family are garlic lovers.  And just popped them on a cookie sheet sprayed with a little Pam!  After 7 minutes in the oven, I flipped them around with a spatula.  Just as a side note, you don't have to be careful flipping them around, they stay together pretty well.  Then put them back in the oven for another 10 minutes.  I served them with both marinara and ranch dressing on the side.  I made 2 full cookie sheets worth of these and they were scarfed down SO quickly!!  I had men that are not at all health concsious raving about them and their wives begging for the recipe.  I am really making an effort to lose weight, I'm down 20 pounds, and recipes like this that are delicious and not obviously \"health food\", make entertaining and hosting really fun for me again.  These really do need to be served right out of the oven, I think you could prep them ahead of time to the point of the cookie sheet and then pop them in the oven when company came over.  Thank you for the excellent recipe!!",

I added garlic and onion powder, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes and parm. cheese to the dry ingred.  I added LA Gold (hot sauce) to the egg mixture.  Before cooking, I did spray the zucchini chips with cooking spray - and again when I tuned them over.  I upped the oven temp. to 500 degrees after flipping the chips - and cooked them for an additional 6 minutes total on second side.  They did get brown, crispy and delicious.  With these additions, the recipe is wonderful - even for those who aren't zucchini lovers.",

These are the only food I've ever prepared (and I try tons of new recipes) that he has ever specifically asked me to make again. I doctored the seasonings (added garlic salt cayenne pepper italian seasoning while using seasoned breadcrumbs) and i actually didn't care for them. They are in the oven now (after many many pleas) made according to the recipe so maybe I'll like them more this time. I did use the suggestion to spray w/Pam before cooking and after flipping and they did turn out pretty crsipy for oven-baked. Thanks for my husbands new favorite recipe! EDIT: I now LOVE these and make them all the time w/no extra seasonings. I use panko and/or seasoned bread crumbs depending on what i have on hand and I never measure anymore just dump and go. I also don't flip (I'm lazy;) ) mid baking and they're still nice and crisp. Solid 5 at the LTH house and a staple side for grilled burgers.",
