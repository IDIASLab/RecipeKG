                "reviewBody": "Okay I'm convinced - these cupcakes are fragrant with the aroma of eggnog as they bake and when you bite into one you are most definitely tasting eggnog as well. The flavor is delicious but I am not a fan of the cupcake itself. Clearly the reason these are so flavorful of eggnog is because so much of it is used in the batter. Unfortunately however I missed the butter that was cut from the package directions in order to accomplish that. The texture is just off. Yes they are dense like a pound cake but there is no crumb to speak of and they're not tender - just dense with the texture resembling that of a sponge. There simply is not enough fat in the eggnog to eliminate the butter that otherwise would have and should have been included. Now the frosting on the other hand is perfect and beautiful. The proportions of each of the ingredients is spot on right up to and including the eggnog - and I enthusiastically rate it five stars. Still the frosting cannot make up for the cupcake underneath it so overall I unfortunately cannot rate this any higher than 3 stars.",

                "reviewBody": "After reading one reviewers opinion that there was not enough fat in these I added the 1/4 cup of butter listed on the package and lowered the eggnog to one cup. I think the added fat is important. I liked these cupcakes; they had the typical pound cake crust (which is the best part) and the dense but not heavy texture. There really is only enough batter to make about 21 decent sized cakes. I did not like the frosting: It was tooth-achingly sweet (a pound of sugar plus the sweet eggnog!)and made me feel a bit sick. I noticed that others felt the same way scraping off the frosting (though the kids didn't seem to mind). I agree with the reviewer who added a lightly sweetened whipped cream topping. I will try them that way if I chose to make these again. (Perhaps the eggnog whipped cream on this site). Without the frosting and with the change in the cupcake recipe these would get four solid stars and would definitely earn my recommendation to both eggnog and pound cake lovers.",
