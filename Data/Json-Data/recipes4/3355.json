As 'ambibambi' herself told me definitely saute the mushrooms in the butter (with a crushed clove of garlic) before then sauteing the shrimp & minced garlic. I slightly undercook the shrimp so that it won't become overcooked in the baking. I have used both baby bellas (cremini) & regular white button mushrooms equally delicious! I've also used many different cheese combinations: only mozz.(which I find rather bland by itself but still good); Kasseri cheese which is a tangy sharp cheese that tastes like a combination of Parmesan Swiss & mellow Monterey Jack; mozz. mixed with the assertive Kasseri; mozz. with sharp cheddar; mozz. with Parmesan; Monterey jack. Every combination - except all-cheddar - was nearly as delicious as my favorite: baby bellas Kasseri cheese (with or without the mozz.). For serving I strongly suggest to separate the mushrooms either after topping with cheese or after baking (the latter is harder because it's hot & you want to serve it quickly while hot) so that guests won't have the cooling cheese pull off the cheese from other mushrooms. I put only a speck of garlic butter on the filled mushrooms so that the appetizer does not drip while being eaten. Or else bake & serve this in individual ramekins so guests can drip onto their own plate. A serving is 2? I think not!",

I only used at most 2 TBSP butter and a dash of EVOO just to lighten it up a little but other than that the ingredients remained the same. After consulting w/ambi I put the shroom caps (large Portabellas) in the oven for about 10 min first then proceeded to fill and bake them. Following the advice of prior reviewers I broiled for about 2 min to get the tops golden brown. My only complain if you will w/these is they're not real easy to eat (and get a bite of everything). When I make them again (notice I said \"when\") I may chop the shrimp for eating ease. Oh yeah don't be an idiot like me and forget to take the tails of the shrimp....THANKS for a keeper ambi!",
