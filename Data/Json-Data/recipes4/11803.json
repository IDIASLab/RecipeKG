When I lightly brown my onions and mushrooms I then add regular flour and also brown it lightly , I then use beef-stock to make my gravy, season it again and add sour- or sweetcream whichever I have handy and I always use freshly ground carawayseeds,when I season my porkstaeks and when I prepare the gravy.",

And served with spatzee which is orange crush and coke. You'll feel like you're at a German fest. I've also made this with turkey or chicken breasts (pounded real thin).",

I made two changes--used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and I used the thin 'breakfast style' pork slices so that I wouldn't have to pound the meat. To make an even thicker crispier crust I dipped the pork in the egg and then in the breadcrumbs and then did that again. I had this as the main dish for my \"Oktoberfest\"-themed cooking club and it was a raving success--especially for a bunch of women who are not big fans of fried meat! I served it with Spaetzle and Rotkohl (red cabbage). I've made it several times for family and friends and it turns out excellent every time. Thanks for the great recipe!",

So I just cut them in half so they would get throughly cooked. I did the full amount of bread crumbs but about half of them did not get used. I thought the sauteed pork tasted fine without the sauce. I may buy some better quality cutlets and tenderize my own and try it again just making that meat. I just really did not care for the sauce at all and found it to be way too chunky.
