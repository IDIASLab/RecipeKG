I frequently \"guesstimate\" my measurements but I think I used about 1 cup of flour to 3 cups of mashed peas.  The mixture still never reached a consistency where I could make patties.  I dropped a huge spoonful of batter into the hot pan, waited for one side to cook, and then turned it over with a spatula.  I used the spatula to smash down the burger after flipping it to flatten it out some.  With this change it is a really good basic recipe and a great way to use leftover beans or peas.",

Like some reviewers, I did find that the flour was not enough, so after having prepared everything else as directed, I then added 1/2 C. unseasoned bread crumbs. I tried a small test patty and it didn't hold together very well. So I added one egg to the mix, and that seemed to help. The only other addition was that I added about 1/2 tsp. cayenne for a little kick. Delicious! I'll definitely make these again. Oh, and perhaps my patties were abnormally small, but I got one dozen patties from this recipe and froze the extra. I ate these on homemade buns with cheddar and a scoop of salsa. Thank you for a great recipe!!!",

We didn't have any shallots, so I sauteed chopped brown onion and garlic. \n\n2. We didn't have any bell pepper either, but I didn't substitute anything for it.\n\n3. I used a bag of frozen black eyed peas and boiled them with smoked turkey legs for flavor. Because of this and the bacon, I didn't add ANY salt. Just black pepper. \n\n4. I got 7 good-sized patties from the one bag of peas. \n\n5. I only had about 5 strips of bacon, so I used that (instead of a full half pound). \n\n6. I dipped each patty in egg (one whole egg, beaten) before rolling it in the flour. I honestly think it would have stuck mostly okay without it. I had none of the problems getting the patties to stick together like some of the other reviews mentioned. They may not have let their beans get soft enough or they didn't mash them enough. I also formed the patties from fully cooled peas.",
