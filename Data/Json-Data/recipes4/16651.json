I used the smallest one a 2-quart slow cooker. I used the HIGH setting and stirred at the end of each hour for 2 hours. Then I turned it to LOW for another hour stirring after each half hour segment. I understand some people do not want sugar and I can respect that. I prefer a small amount of erythritol/stevia blend and added it at the end before I filled 6 small half pint jars. Now I have breakfast ready for the week and can add berries or nothing at all. Update - This is delicious cold even! A great grab-n-go breakfast!",

I often make it just as written and other times leave out the banana or raisins and add some cinnamon nutmeg and ginger then squeeze in some honey for sweetness. Someone mentioned leaving out the raisins if omitting sugar is your goal but it is refined sugar that many of us are trying to cut back on so go ahead and add those raisins if this is your goal too! This is a recipe that begs to be tweaked to your liking - add the spices/fruits/sweetener of your choice and enjoy! Oh and it will fill a bunch of jars they just won't be huge jars! I use the little jelly jars that hold about a cup. But this makes for a very filling breakfast so you don't need more than a cup in the morning to feel satisfied and get on with your day!:) I also warm mine up then add some Almond Milk - yum!!!",
