Instead of red pepper flakes, I used cayenne pepper (1/4 tsp. plus a couple of extra shakes) to get the flavor I was looking for.  I was surprised what a difference the rice krispies made -- they lighten up the crackers and give them a nice crunch while still letting the cheesy flavor come through.  Be sure to cool them on paper towels when they come out of the oven to absorb the excess fat.  This recipe also makes a lot which is good because once you taste them, you're going to want more!",
