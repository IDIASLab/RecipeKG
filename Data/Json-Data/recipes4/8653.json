It is amazingly delicious. I am SO happy I found it. It's the same size coming out as it is going in.  How many recipes can claim that?  It's HUGE. \n\nCold sandwiches the next day were excellent.

I microwaved the onions and green peppers before adding them to make sure they would be well cooked.  Possibly next time I'll bake at a lower temperature, as all the sides of the loaf were a bit tough.  Adding Italian seasonings, garlic, and topping with ketchup before baking gives even more of an Italian flavor.   Thanks!",
