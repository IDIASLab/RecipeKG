I sauted one clove of minced garlic with the peppers & onions, cooked til tender.I added a can of diced tomatoes (with the juice) and one chopped carrot, and about a tsp of herbs de provence and simmered the vegetables for 20 minutes or so. I cooked the lentils in a combo of chx broth and water (don't know if that made a difference or not)for about 30 minutes. Then,drained and added to the vegetables and simmered the whole thing for another 10 minutes or so.  My husband doesn't eat lentils, so I had the whole batch for myself.  I froze some and am anxious to see how it tastes after having been frozen (I didn't know if you can freeze cooked lentils or not -- we'll see!)  Thank you for this delicious and easy recipe.",

I also cooked the lentils in a vegetable broth instead of plain water. I served this with brown rice and even my carnivorous husband said it was good!
