After the first rise I felt a loaf pan would be too small so I free-formed the dough.

The flavor is really good, there are notes from the molasses and cocoa but they are balanced.  Thanks, this will be made often.",

Shared with my coworkers, who loved it.  This makes 2 loaves if you are okay with a small loaf size; I am, so 2 it is for me.  If you prefer a larger loaf, though, it would work in large loaf pans or free form as previous reviewer did.  Nice, basic pumpernickel loaf that was great with cheese and dijon mustard but equally delicious with just some honey.  Proportions worked perfectly for me as well.  Thanks for the recipe!",
