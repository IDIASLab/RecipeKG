Make it with or without tomato paste; I actually prefer it without. Tonight I didn't have onion so I just used extra carrot and added a can of tomatoes. It's always yummy and satisfying. You have to add the vinegar though, it makes it much more flavorful. It doesn't matter what kind you use, I use balsamic most of the time. Perfect with crusty french bread and goat cheese..yum!\n\nUpdate: I recently began experimenting with the recipe by adding 3 diced and peeled red potatoes, a can of diced tomatoes, and a dash of cayenne. Perhaps not as traditional but delicious nonetheless!",

They help with not feeling \"heavy\" after having a plate of legumes.\n2. DO NOT FORGET TO RINSE THEM AFTER BOILING FOR A WHILE! IT IS A CRUCIAL STEP TO COOKING FAKES. IF YOU SKIP THIS STEP YOU WILL BE LEFT WITH LEGUMES TASTING LIKE DOG FOOD. YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS.\n3. Sprinkle some grated Greek cheese on top of your plate ex. xerotiri which is salty or something similar to it. \n4. Grind some fresh black pepper.\n5. Finally, for an extra boost of flavor add a few drops of mild Tabasco.... Fakes will soon become your new best -comfort food...",
