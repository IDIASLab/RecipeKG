I would add a little salt and pepper to the mixture and save the Old Bay for sprinkling over the finished product. The eggs should be mashed separately and the crab meat folded in to avoid losing that delicate texture in the egg mixture. That amount of Old Bay was really bad.",

Ecuadorians LOVE their seafood and my friends here always ask me to bring back some Old Bay every trip I make from my hometown Las Vegas Nevada. I made these for a dinner party the other night and everyone went crazy and were begging for the recipe. Wonderful job on your submission I changed only to fresh crab from the coast here and otherwise was lovely and enjoyed by all our dinner guests! My only complaint is I set the plate down and left the room when I returned so were the eggs gone too? None left for me? Will double next time but I did get to lick the mixing spoon! Wonderful enjoyed by all! Thank you!",
