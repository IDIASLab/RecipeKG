So many variables...your oven's temperature size and thickness of cookies etc. Baking my \"bones\" for 20 minutes was far too long even though I used a 4\" cookie cutter. I would recommend starting out with a baking time several minutes less than recipe states. You can always add time but you can't undo it! Other than my own error these were wonderful little treats. Quick and easy to mix together and roll out. I thought puppy might appreciate a little sweetness so I too added a bit of honey. If I can find a recipe next time I make these I would like to try a yogurt frosting for these similar to what they use at retail stores like the Stylish Paw!",

The first batch I rolled out too thin and baked for too long so they turned out to be a little darker than what I had planned. The dogs didn't mind, they ate them anyway. I didn't have any skim milk on hand and I also didn't have any whole wheat flour so I used all-purpose flour and substituted apple sauce for the milk. I also added a tablespoon of honey for a little splash of sweetness. The dough tasted great and Dana, Midnight, and Annie love the treats!",

                "reviewBody": "I made these this morning as gifts to go with one of my dogs who is being sent to Ontario to be bred. These dog cookies are so easy! I have an expensive healthy dog cookie book where most recipes require a long list of real ingrediants including powdered milk or corn meal. The latter ingredients I rarely use so I have to plan making dog cookies instead of being spontaneous. I had all 4 ingrdients in this recipe - and they are healthy! I have Toy Manchester Terriers and as another member suggested I just rolled the dough into teeny tiny balls and pressed them with a fork as I would a peanut butter cookie. I ended up throwing out almost half the dough because after rolling more than 150 little balls I was tired!!! So next time I will half the recipe. I baked the wee little cookies for about 7-10 minutes just until they were golden brown on the bottom. They were too cute! They look just like mini peanut butter cookies! As mentioned most of these cookies were used as doggie gift packages. I use a small brown paper bag and fold it closed near the top. I staple it once then make a hole with a hole punch and make a nice bow with twine. I either use color markers to write on the bag or add a tag with the twine! Thank you Tami for an amazing and much appreciated dog cookie recipe!!",

I roll out the dough, put it on a greased cookie sheet, then roll a pizza cutter thru them and make them rather small- about 1 inch squares, then bake until crispy. This is a quick and easy way to make lots of treats. She loves them!! I use them at obedience class and all the dogs just love them.  They will do anything for these treats. Great recipe, healthy, and much cheaper than store bought treats.  If you're concerned about the ingredients in store bought treats- these are perfect.",
