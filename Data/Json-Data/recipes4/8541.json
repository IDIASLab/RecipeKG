Oh, and because the kids do not care for feta cheese, I used a mix of parmesan and mozzarella. I topped 1/2 with mozzarella before baking and they were perfectly cooked in 15 minutes. These also came out of the pan nicely, which is something I was worried about. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)",
