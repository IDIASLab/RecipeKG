It also tends to be quite bland so season aggressively before adding the filling. Speaking of while I was making this dish for a friend we came up with a bunch of alternate uses for the filling including stuffed green peppers and stuffed grilled poblanos. I'm going to add some frozen peas and have it as a main dish tonight. Will make again!",

I kept everything else the same and the stuffing was still bland! I did like the hint of mustard in it. FYI Those quantities yielded enough stuffing for 1.5 acorn squash. The recipe did not state to cover the dish before placing in the oven. After baking for 40 minutes the stuffing dried out and the squash didn't really soften. I added a little water to the bottom of the pan covered with foil and baked 20 minutes more. The squash was the perfect texture and the stuffing had moistened up a bit from the steam but my son wouldn't eat it because it was too hard.",
