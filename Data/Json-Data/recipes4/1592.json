Update: I've made these many times now. Love them. A little tip: I put the barbecue sauce in a small/med deep bowl and dunk the ribs in with tongs. So much easier than brushing.",

These ribs were the best I've ever made grilled or in the oven. So easy! You can do other things while they are boiling on the stove and then toss them on the grill and in a few minutes they're done. I am already sharing the recipe with friends! Thanks!",
