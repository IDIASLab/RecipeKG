I made a few small changes but mine was still essentially the same. What I did: used chicken broth instead of beef used Foster's brand beer omitted chili-garlic sauce but added cayenne and flaked red pepper to taste roasted my own red peppers on the grill grilled the bratwurst after boiling to brown them then sliced them into bite-size pieces and returned to the sauce.
