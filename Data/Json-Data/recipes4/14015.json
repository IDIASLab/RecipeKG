I was in a pinch because I was out of ravioli I made it myself-using 2 cups sifted flour mixed with 1 egg pinch of salt and 1 tbsp olive oli-- rolled into dough with filling inside set on top of one another: fried mackerel(with olive oil chopped parsley dill black pepper and salt) slices of fried aubergine mozarella cheese and tomatoes. Then I followed this recipe as stated although I made a lot of changes eg substitute celery with spring onions and celery seeds I didn't have thyme so I omitted I actually boiled my raviolis for 3 minutes in the strained shrimp stock before making the sauce..added more dill to the sauce(love how the dills gave this dish a flavorful smell) substitute canned tomatoes with cherry tomatoes white wine with white grape juice and 2 tbsp cider vinegar. My sauce turned out thin but really it was perfect when teamed up with the ravioli. I didn't have heavy cream so I omitted and use whipped cream in a can and spray on top of my dish. This was the first time I learn what is ravioli and how to make them I was surprised myself it turns out soo juicy and tasty. I am impossible you can try it your way but overall this recipe is so hearty and delicious I love it!",

                "reviewBody": "I followed every single solitary detail of this recipe. What ruined this recipe? The insane amount of lemon. One whole lemon cut in half and squeezing it's juice into the stock was a HUGE mistake. Compound this by later adding in 2 tspn of lemon zest. Ugh! Horrible!! This was BITTER. Not to mention 1 tspn of Kosher salt was way too much salt as well. And yes I do like lemon but in this dish it was overkill. If you want this recipe to go well here is what I recommend.Use half a lemon in the stock and don't squeeze the juice out at all just let the stock absorb it. And because you already have the lemon completely skip using the lemon zest period. Zest is bitter! Use 1/4 tspn of salt. If that's not enough add it to your OWN plate later! Also too much parsley - 1/4 cup would have been enough. Don't use Diced Petite Tomatoes. Go with Italian plum and shred them up. This sauce needs a little bit of sweetness to kill the bitterness of the lemon. I ended up having to add some sugar to kill the bitter flavor of this sauce.",
