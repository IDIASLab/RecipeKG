I halved the recipe and substituted a bottle of beer for equal part of water and used half kidney beans and half pinto-in-chili sauce beans.  I like my chili a bit thicker, so I added more flour disolved in water at the end.  I served it with chopped onions, sour cream and warm flour tortillas.  This has just the right amount of spice, in my opinion - I like it spicy!  I think this recipe without the beans and meat mixed with some cheddar-jack cheese would make a great enchilada sauce... in fact, I might try that and create my own recipe.  Thanks, Emily!",
