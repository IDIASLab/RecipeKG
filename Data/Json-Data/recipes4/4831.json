First I couldn't find any red bell peppers I liked I used orange - the recipe works with any bell pepper. And instead of putting the mixture into a whole bell pepper I cut the peppers in half lengthwise so the egg part is more visible. I think its prettier presentation. I also used crumpled foil to keep the peppers from rolling when putting in or taking out of the oven. All in all a great idea - I will put this on my regular rotation!",
