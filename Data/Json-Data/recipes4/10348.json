The chunks of cherry are a little off-putting to me particularly since they're not accompanied by a burst of flavor. I elected to bake as cupcakes (and bake time was longer than usual for them...close to 25 minutes as opposed to the usual 16) for easier individual serving. I frosted them w/a buttercream to which I added cherry juice and almond extract and I found myself preferring the taste of the frosting to the cake. It's a beautifully moist cake w/a nice strong chocolate flavor. If I made this again I'd def sub at least 1/2 the water for cherry juice and see if that amped up the cherry flavor. Instead of chopping the cherries I think I'd also simply place a whole cherry in the center of the cupcake for a burst of flavor. THANKS for the recipe dms036!",
