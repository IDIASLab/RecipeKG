A quality bacon can also be subbed for the prosciutto without harming the flavor and if you prefer your sauce very thick an easy way is to add a couple teaspoons of flour (up to a tablespoon however you need to leave at least an equal amount of oil/drippings in the pan) after you've sauteed the meat in the pan stir it around and let it cook for a minute before slowly whisking in the cream. Wonderful comfort food! Thank you for posting!",

I sauteed the prosciutto with slices of half an onion first until the onions were almost clear.  I had no peas, but used 1/2 a can of chopped asparagus.  Added the vegetable and the sauce and heated it through.  This is a REALLY good, quick, and versatile meal.  My boyfriend finished his whole plate.
