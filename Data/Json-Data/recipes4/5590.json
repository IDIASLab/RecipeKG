I altered the recipe slightly so as to make it work better for me \u2013 first, I had boneless chops and found the stint in the oven unnecessary.  A few minutes in the fry pan on each side was not only sufficient, it was perfect, tho\u2019 I did de-glaze the pan with some white wine, allowing the chops some simmering time while it reduced. The chops were tender and juicy and the crumb coating stayed put.  I added garlic powder to the salt and pepper seasoning, fearing fresh minced might burn during the saut\u00e9ing.  Finally, I used fresh, minced sage from my garden.  The lemon zest was an unexpected and pleasant addition which I would not recommend omitting.",

Additionally, if you happen to be a chef that imbibes libations from time to time, you can grate extra lemon zest and contribute part to a Martini Shaker and part to your Martini Glass. You can also use the lemon that was grated for the lemon juice needed for a wonderful, lemon drop Martini. 2/12/2013",

I didn't have any lemons to zest so I added a splash of lemon juice to the egg. Tasted all right but had to cook quite a bit longer than suggested and ended up a bit dry. But that's why I don't cook pork; it's a pain to get right. Might try again if I get stupid and buy pork chops again haha.",
