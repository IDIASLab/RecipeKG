Well in any case I used a thin sliced pork chop and messed up on my first try reason: I was cooking too hot and simmering way too high. The whole process took me about 15 minutes to complete but if you are using a standard stove (i.e. dials from 1 - 9) you should use 5 to cook the chop brown on both side and then simmer at 1 or low for 5 minutes.",
