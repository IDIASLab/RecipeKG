This is a lightweigt fluffy yet very moist cake that was very easy to make. I used chocolate cake mix with the orange gelatin simply becuase I like the taste of chocolate and orange together. Next time I might use orange extract in place of the vanilla to intensify the orange flavor but that's just personal preference. Great recipe... Thanks!",

This year I made this recipe because I wanted to try something we've never had. The recipe was super easy and very delicious. As someone else suggested I only used half of the vanilla and replaced it with orange extract. Also I didn't want to use a bundt pan for a birthday cake so I used two 9\" round pans. Baked perfectly at 375 for 30 minutes. For the icing I used 1 tub (16 oz) of whipped topping mixed with 8 oz of sour cream 3/4 tsp of orange extract and 2 cups of confectioners sugar. Then topped with some candied orange slices. Turned out really well although if I ever make it again I might try a chocolate based frosting for contrasting flavors. Either way you can't go wrong.",
