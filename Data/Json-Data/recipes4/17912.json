It is simple to make tastes wonderful to me using the exact ingredients called for in the recipe. I made a 1/2 recipe of an old family-favorite scratch chocolate cake (a recipe my mom got from a friend back in the mid-1960 s) in a 9X9 pan. The glaze was exactly enough to generously cover the top of the cake. I tasted the glaze before putting it on my cake and I just loved the flavor. Great recipe. Thank you!",
