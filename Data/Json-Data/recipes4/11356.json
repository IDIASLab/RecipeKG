I used 8 egg yolks, 7 cans evaporated milk, 4 cans cream of coconut, 4 cans sweetened condensed milk, no water, 2+ cups Captain Morgan's Parrot Bay Rum (it's Puerto Rican coconut rum...adds a little more coconut flavor to the cream de coco), 1 tsp cloves, 2 tsp cinnamon and 4 tsp vanilla. I didn't use a double boiler, just a large stock pot and warmed it slowly while stirring it almost constantly and using a candy thermometer to see when it got to 160 degrees.  Then I just blended the eggnog in 4 batches, so I added the cloves, cinnamon, vanilla and rum in the measurements stated on the recipe, which would add up to the measurements I gave at the beginning of the review.  I ended up with about a gallon and a half, there was a little more but I had to use that for a couple of taste tests!! This is the first time I have made eggnog and I chose this because my boyfriend is Puerto Rican. He can't wait to get home from work to try it and I can't wait to serve it tomorrow night at our family's Christmas dinner!  This is DEFINITELY a keeper!  THANK YOU, BRANDY!! ... *Update* ...The next morning after it had cooled in the fridge, it was pretty thick.  We tasted it and decided to add more rum (we like drinks strong).  We just added a little at a time until it was the right consistency.  It was a HUGE hit at Christmas dinner!  Even people who don't normally drink eggnog loved it!  12/24/08- Update again.  I made this yesterday for Christmas tomorrow and it's incredible!  I didn'",

I make mine with more rum but not everyone like alcohol like some of us do and therefore the water. Those who think this is sweet should not be searching for eggnog!!!  I am puertorican so don't let my name fool u. Anything other than coconut flavor is NOT coquito :p. This is my recipe and it was changed by all recipes to use a double boiler. You don't need to use a double boiler in my opinion as long as the eggs are fresh. If allergic to eggs, you could ommit them altogether and it won't change the flavor much; if at all. It will be just less thick and of course and eggless eggnog :). Instead of plain water I sometimes use coconut milk if I have it on hand. Coconut water will make it a bit salty and the use of coconut milk instead of coconut water is recommended or just use plain water. You still need the coconut cream for the coquito regardless so don't confuse the two.",
