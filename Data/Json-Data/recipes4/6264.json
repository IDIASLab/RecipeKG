For our tastes we like a bit of sesame oil and hot pepper flakes for extra flavor, but as written this is wonderful. Thanks so much for sharing!",

We also double the sauce and add broccoli/frozen vegies to help it go further.

I diced up the chicken and put it in a bowl with some corn starch and paprika for color coated the chicken and fried it up a bit before I added the liquid ingredients and added a dash of red pepper flakes - it turned out PERFECT!
