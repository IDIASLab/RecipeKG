Do NOT remove it from the oven, just pour the dough (batter, really) into the baking vessel and then cover and bake.   That way you don't lose the heat you just spent half an hour to achieve to heat the pan.  Also, there's no need to shake the dough once it's in the pan, it'll spread by itself while baking.   It's really a misnomer to call this a dough, because it really comes out as a batter.  I agree with the other reviewer that it's impossible to form it into any kind of a ball 'cause it's just too sticky.  And forget the step of placing it on a towel to raise.  It's just messy and doesn't achieve anything more than if you just stir it and place it in a bowl and let it rise another 2 hours.  That said, I would rate this a 4, only because I think the instructions are not the best way to make this bread.",

I'll have to try adding the fresh herbs, though.  Great idea! Proud as a peacock, I brought a few slices from my first loaf to work.  One of my colleagues, who lived many years in various European countries, picked up a piece and immediately identified it as European peasant bread.  After one bite, she said, \"I need this recipe.\"  (She hasn't bothered with recipes in years!)  BTW, the \"heavy-duty casserole dish\" should be either cast iron or stoneware.  I've read that Le Creuset works fine, as long as you remove the handles, which aren't oven-safe at 450 F.  UPDATE: I brought this bread (minus the herbs) to a staff potluck, and it was a great success.  There were many recipe requests.  Those who've tried it are converts.  The only challenges are to find the proper pot and to figure out the timing.  I haven't bought bread since I discovered this recipe!\n2ND UPDATE:  I've found, tweeked, and posted a recipe for a healthier yet delicious whole-wheat multi-grain bread which uses the same method.",

Lift the parchment paper & dough out of the bowl and place it into the hot pot.  Take a scissors and cut the excess parchment paper from around the top of the pot.  Put the lid back on the pot and place it into the oven.  After the first 5 minutes, lower the oven to 475 degrees & continue to bake for 25 minutes more.  After 30 minutes, take out the pot, remove the lid & check the internal temperature. If it reads 200 degrees, & the end of the thermometer is not sticky or gooey, put the uncovered pot back in for 10-15 minutes until browned. Remove pot, use a turner to lift the bread & paper out & place bread on cooling rack. Remove paper when cooled.",

I always thought that getting the dough from a towel into the pot a really clunky process, so I started using baking parchment and got myself a La Cloche. I rip off a piece of parchment a bit bigger than the bottom of the La Cloche, sprinkle it with flour or semolina and place the formed dough on it.  Cover with a tea towel and allow it to rise while the La Cloche is preheating.  What is great about this is that when the dough is ready to bake you can just lift the parchment and set it into the bottom of the La Cloche and put the lid on it.  The parchment will stick out, but it does not affect the baking process at all.  Sometimes the risen dough is so slack that I have to slide a pizza peel under the parchment to lift and transfer the loaf to the pot, but it works great, beautiful, high loaves of bread, no flipping or mess.",

Simply add cran. and walnuts to flour mixture, then add water.  Follow directions as given.   I've had luck with a shorter proofing time also....12-15 hrs depending on the season.
