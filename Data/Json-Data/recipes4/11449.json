If you don't have time and want a very fast potato soup this is the recipe. Have more time and want a better tasting soup use fresh potatoes. The second time I used fresh cubed potatoes sliced baby carrots one stalk celery and a little parsley. Excellent. This soup would be very good served in a bread bowl. It is a very good tasting basic recipe that you can make your own. The secret ingredient is the country gravy mix. If you don't like onion and red pepper for the original recipe use hash browns without the onion and pepper for the fast version. Don't like carrots or celery for the fresh potato version don't add. You could also add ham or cooked crumbled bacon at the end and warm through. I have been looking for a good potato soup without cheese for quite some time. I finally found it. If you want you could add cheese to this soup also and it would be very good. Like I said this is a very good basic soup that you can tweak to your own liking. Thank you Stephanie.",

                "reviewBody": "Holy cow Stephanie. You outdid yourself on this one. I can hardly believe that so few ingredients are capable of turning out a soup with the rich and creamy taste that this soup has. It's a piece of cake to make and so amazingly good. It really tastes as if a master chef had prepared it for an upscale restaurant. I only have one caveat to share. I could not find the fat-free country style gravy mix. If anybody knows where this can be found or even what brand to look for I would appreciate the help. I went to two different stores and still couldn't find the fat free stuff. So I settled on Williams Brand Country Style Gravy Mix. For those of you that are nutritionally conscious there are 15 fat calories per serving and 40 calories per serving in the package I used (37% of the gravy mix calories are fat calories). Though I'm not a dietician with the no-fat potatoes and nearly fat-free chicken broth reducing the impact of the gravy mix's contribution to overall fat in the recipe I suspect this is still an acceptable low-fat choice. Though I suppose you probably shouldn't have 2 1/2 large bowls like I just did. I couldn't help myself. Honest.",
