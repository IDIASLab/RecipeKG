The second time I decided to tweak the recipe to my tastes a bit more. Like the previous reviewer I omitted the salt (canned tomatoes typically have enough for my tastes) and used fresh mint. I cooked the tomato sauce as advised but added a bit of white wine and garlic. For the stuffing rather than cook the meat and rice in the oven I added oil to the saut\u00e9 pan with garlic onion and uncooked rice. This gives the rice a head start on cooking and a lot more flavor. I saut\u00e9ed all until everything browned a bit and added the lamb which I saut\u00e9ed until cooked. I used a slotted spoon to remove the mixture and stuff into the zucchini to reduce some of the grease. The final cook time for the stuffed zucchini was 30 minutes. My boyfriend indicated this was a keeper recipe.",

I added a splash of white wine. i added fresh mint instead of dried because it grows like weed in my garden. While it was cooking the smell alone was enough to make us all salivate and the end result was spectacular! comfort food at its best! thank you for the great recipe!!!",

Second I didn't realize I had no tomato paste until I was well into preparing this so I just cooked the sauce down to thicken it. Third I used fresh mint instead of dried because I had it on hand. The cinnamon adds a lovely flavor and I think next time I will increase it slightly. Thanks for a tasty dish.",
