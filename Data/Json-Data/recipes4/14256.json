I was tempted to add more zucchini than the recipe called for but I felt for the first time I should make the recipe exactly as directed. The amount of zucchini was just perfect so I'm glad I didn't add more. Like another reviewer said, the cheese is good but you don't really need it. Beause I have a cholesterol problem, I put a little cheese on part of my meal, then left it off the rest of it. As good as it was I felt it was missing a little something but ketchup took care of that! I will make this again.",
