I often substitute fresh onions and garlic maybe throw in some peppers into this dish, honestly it is what I have on hand.  I do however recommend to  adding salt/pepper to your taste, especially the pepper.  A nice twist is to add fresh cilantro, parsley or chives after cooking.  It is hard to put recipes out there to be reviewed, I mostly put this up so I could remember how much spice to use when I make it.  Remember cooking is not a science, you have to taste/smell what you are making instead of blindly following a recipe.",

I saut\u00e9ed chopped red and green bell pepper with some red onion (instead of dried onion) and minced garlic (instead of garlic powder).  Now we're talking!  As this recipe's first reviewer I'm pleased to be the first to say this is a  lovely rice dish, full of great flavor and beautiful color, and it would look great alongside anything you'd care to serve with it. Hubs couldn't stop raving (which he didn't do about the fish and green beans that were also on his plate...)",

It was restaurant quality and have saved this as the base for all my yellow rice dishes !!",
