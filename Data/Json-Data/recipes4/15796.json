The only exception is that I made both chocolate and vanilla cupcakes according to directions on the boxes. I used a grapefruit spoon to scoop out the centers of the cupcakes when cool. At my house there was no need to discard the cut-out portions since I have a hungry teen. Caution keep a close watch on the coconut when toasting as it will burn quickly. I placed the toasted coconut in a bowl and after frosting the cupcakes just inverted them in the coconut gently rolling the edges around a bit. I found it is better not to press down the center since less coconut is needed in the center depression. The candy eggs need to touch some frosting to stick well. I used chocolate frosting for both the chocolate and vanilla cupcakes. Both turned out wonderful and looked exactly like the picture. I used Whoppers mini eggs. These cupcakes were a delightful and tasty novelty for Easter and everyone complimented them and even took pictures. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will make these every year from now on!",
