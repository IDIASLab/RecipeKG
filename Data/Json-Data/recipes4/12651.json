I made major changes to ingredients cutting way back on butter----1-T for flavor a little canola oil and spraying the nonstick pot with PAM. Threw in a package of sliced baby bella mushrooms & a diced onion first cooked them a til onion was transparent then removed added a little more oil and browned the chicken a little. Used skinless chicken thighs(more flavor) and breast strips. Returned the onion mushroom mix to pot added seasonings--salt pepper poultry seasoning(all to taste)& 3 cans of low sodium chicken stock and simmered until meat was tender. Used 8 oz. each of low fat & fat free sour cream. If it needs thickening add a little corn starch and water before adding sour cream. Served over instant brown rice(I added a little onion powder to it) and tossed some chopped green onions on top. A bit more work but I'm suppose to be on a low sodium low fat low everything if it tastes good spit it out diet.",
