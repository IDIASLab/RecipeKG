I make mine in a slow cooker to make it even easier- just chop and heat. (Short on time.) I add basil, thyme, and Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning (instead of salt and pepper-it gives it more of a kick.)  I just add to taste.  My great aunt used to make this a lot and she used a cast iron skillett.  If you have one do use it.  It adds to the flavor, plus it adds iron to the diet. I use one when I'm not in a hurry and it is well worth the effort.  Plus the cast iron burns off the slimeness of the okra.  My aunt never once had slimey okra!  ",
