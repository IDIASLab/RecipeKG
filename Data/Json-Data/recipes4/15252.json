The dough needs to be really thin I think for it to be \"light and flaky\". I like a thicker dough so one recipe was enough for just the bottom of my 9 pie pan. Then I did another for the top pattern. Anyhow when baked it was ediable but definately not award winning. I will try to thin out the crust and then update this review but those do not want a paper thin crust this is not quite the one to use.",

I used 1/2 cup of shortening, and I think it is just the right amount of flaky; not too much either. So overall, super happy :)",
