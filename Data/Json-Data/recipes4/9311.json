Add pickles, butter, onion, parsley, dill. Omit salt. Add 1/2 cup pickle juice. Stir in 2 cups flour to form a soft dough. Knead in enough flour to make a smooth, elastic dough (2 3/4 cup, 12 minutes for me). Let rise in greased bowl 1 hr or until double. Punch down dough, form loaf in greased pan, let rise 30 min. Bake at 375F for 40 min, covering with foil after 1st 15min.  Wonderful, dill-y bread. Thanks!",

My yeast was good I have used it sucessfully recently on other recipes. I did wonder why there was no sugar in the recipe...I thought yeast needs sugar to act. Also I am told salt keeps the yeast in check so the extra salt in the pickle juice may have done something also. This recipe smelled wonderful as it baked I was sorry it didn't turn out. I threw the bread away. Anyone have any suggestions to save this recipe? Had it risen it would have been wonderful. Thanks! Heather",
