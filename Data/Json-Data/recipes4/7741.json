I also halved the recipe used milk instead of half and half and forgot the spinach completely so I added a few extra green onions. I couldn't find any ham and ended up with deli ham which wasn't the best. The recipe would have been great with leftover ham. So I will make this again with a few tweaks: not forget the spinach THINLY slice the green onions as listed and refrigerate only 15-20 minutes before baking. (You know follow the recipe a little better!) Mine was quite 'wet' and I don't know if it's because of the overnight soak or the fact that my dish probably wasn't big enough. I think an 8 x 8 pan would be a better size if you half the recipe.",

It had been in there for so long it had gone stale. Since it was not a commercially sliced loaf I did slice some of the bread to line the bottom of the baking dish then cubed the rest and layered as instructed. I decided to use what I had on hand which was leftover ham Swiss cheese and a little bit of cheddar along with the chopped fresh spinach. I did not have any green onions so I added about a couple of teaspoons of stone ground mustard to the custard base. I may add more next time. It was the perfect balance for my husband and me. I prepared it and I cooked it as instructed and it was a tad watery. TIP for next time I will either saute the fresh spinach to get the water out or use frozen spinach that has been thawed and the moisture thoroughly squeezed out.",
