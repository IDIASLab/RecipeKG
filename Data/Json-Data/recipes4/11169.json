I also used nonfat milk that's all I drink except for in my coffee or hot tea. I should have figured it out but whole milk would be so much better or a little 1/2 and 1/2 with the nonfat milk. Next time I will keep it in the refrigerator and heat up a glass when I want hot tea. I think this recipie would be better as a hot tea than a cold tea. But still a good cold tea. Hope that made some since.",

All I had on hand was flavored green tea bags so I used that and 1 cup of 2% milk (bc that's what I drink) and a little more than 1/2 cup half and half (to make up for the lost fat and creaminess of the 2%). I only occasionally drink coffee in the mornings but still want a little kick of caffeine. This is very light and will be a perfect iced drink that's already made to get me going.
