I was in the mood for something a little different and chose this, thinking I would be the only one interested in trying it. I was wrong and should have tripled this! Everyone that tried it wanted it and I had to promise there would be enough for everyone next time. I followed the recipe except I had used my shallots in another side dish and only had Vidalia in the pantry. This worked out perfect in our opinion and I wouldn't hesitate to make it the same again. This sauce is delicious and the bacon goes perfectly with the tenderloin. Thanks for sharing!",

Hubs simply pan seared the steaks in a cast iron skillet in a combination of butter and olive oil, butterflying mine to guarantee it would cook to my preferred medium well, leaving his thick and luscious, cooked to a perfect medium rare.  This time I did not want a charcoal flavor on the steaks.  Since we used bacon-wrapped filets, I did not include bacon in the sauce. Once the filets were cooked and set aside to rest, I prepared the sauce in the same pan, removing most of the drippings.  I added a little butter, maybe a tablespoon, and cooked one, just one, chopped shallot.  Rather than  half and half, I stirred in heavy cream and 1 T. whole grain mustard.  Three minutes was more than  adequate to thicken the sauce.  In fact, I found I had to add a little cream just before serving to thin it out a tad.  I plated this by spooning some of the sauce on the dinner plate, topped it with the filet,  and then topped each filet with a few beautiful and exotic wild mushrooms.  I served this with boiled new potatoes and steamed asparagus, scattering fresh chopped parsley over all. This was absolutely the finest dinner I've had in some time, either at home or out.  Hubs said this was another one of those \"make again\" dinners he'll never see again, which is his highest form of compliment.  It was not an inexpensive dinner but we enjoyed and savored every dollar of it.",
