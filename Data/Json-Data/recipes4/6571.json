The only changes I made were to add mushrooms, because you can never have too many mushrooms in anything.  The other change I made was that I use the product called \"Better than Bouillon\" instead of canned chicken broth, and I added some extra to make the soup a bit chicken-y-er; I thought it tasted a bit flour-y. Oh yes, and I used skim milk in place of the ff half and half.  Wonderful soup! I served it with the bread called \"steakhouse bread\" from this site--warm from the bread machine. A perfect meal!!!!",

This is rich and satisfying, but still nutritious given all the good meat and vegetables - even more so if you skip the flour, which I did.  I\u2019s not necessary.  I added mushrooms to the mix which was a good and compatible addition. Loved the zucchini in this for substance, but loved the addition of the red bell pepper even more \u2013 it gave the soup a great boost of flavor.  I used full fat half-and-half, and chose to use a little more chicken broth than the equal parts broth and half-and-half called for.  We like very simple, fresh flavors, so omitting the nutmeg and thyme was a good choice for our taste preference.",

My husband in really not into veggies so I was able to hide most of then by using an emersion blender on everything but the chicken and the gnocchi (left out the red pepper and the spinach..that would be hard to hide, and put that in my half).  Snuck the rest right by him and he really liked it too.\nThanks Kristin for getting veggies into my husband!",

This is the best recipe I have tried on this site so far and considering I have tried approximately two hundred this is saying a lot! I don't buy rotisserie chicken but I own an electric pressure cooker that takes fifteen minutes to cook several leg quarters to fall off the bone tenderness so I used that instead. I also reduced the half & half by one cup and used milk instead. The only other change I made was to omit the red bell pepper since I don't like it. This was the perfect way to use gnocchi in a different vehicle than just covering it in sauce. It is my favorite pasta and I love it cooked past the point of just done and more on the 'fluffy' end so allowing it to cook in this savory mixture created the perfect texture to my taste. My family raved about this soup and the recipe is going in my rotation to be made regularly. Thanks Kristin for sharing this awesome recipe!",
