I appreciate that Allrecipes has a calculate button as I used it on this recipe to take the 12 servings down to 6. I wanted some leftovers for lunches but didn't need 12 serving leftovers! The 2 changes I made (because it is what I had on hand) was my diced tomatoes had jalapenos in them and my cream cheese had chives in it. I think the jalapenos added a nice kick to the recipe but it didn't make it too spicy. I froze a container for our college son. This would be a great recipe to take to a large gathering as even half a recipe took the 3 qt. baking dish to bake. Will be making this one again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",
