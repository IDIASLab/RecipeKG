I add more onion and some chopped celery & bell pepper and sometimes even some sliced mushrooms to the turkey saute along with garlic powder poultry seasoning and some cajun seasoning as ground turkey can be very bland. I too add a little grated cheese to the top. This makes for a delcious and healthy version plus you can sneak all kinds of veggies into the meal!",
