I used about 6 table spoons tahini instead of 4. I used 2 whole eggs instead of whites only. I used a table spoon of oyster sauce as well as soy. I used up some corriander we had in the fridge. I cut the amount of liquid by half and cut the water with a generous amount of balsamic vinegar. I used white flour since this was what we had on hand. I also added some salt and red chili flakes. I dipped thin slices of extra firm tofu in the batter leaving some in the bowl. Half way through baking I poured on the rest of the batter. I baked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. My partner and I thought this version tasted great.",
