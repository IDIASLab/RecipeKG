If your not that keen on orange or simply think that orange Jello-O would not taste good with chocolate cake then don't use that flavor. I used Black Berry Fusion Jell-O and I found the flavors went very well together. The Jell-O keeps the cake super moist and unlike another reviewer I didn't have a problem with the cake crumbling. We also really liked the frosting.",

My grocery store didn't have the whipped topping mix so I used a tub of frozen whipped topping (Cool Whip(R)). I still mixed it with the chocolate pudding and just added a bit of milk to help with the consistency. Also I didn't need such a large cake for the small dinner party so I split the cake into 1 one cake and 12 cupcakes.",
