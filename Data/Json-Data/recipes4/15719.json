I had 10\" tortillas so used two of those instead of three 8\" tortillas used hot salsa in place of the picante sauce added a finely diced jalapeno (deseeded) to the onion and red pepper used tomatoes with cilantro and lime juice in place of the tomatoes with green chiles and used condensed cheddar soup instead of the fiesta style. It turned out great. My hubby suggested adding another layer of tortillas and cheese in the middle of the chicken mixture but I chose this recipe because it was low-cal and low in cholesterol so I will make it that way next time but will probably put the original recipe in my keeper bin. My hubby has already shared it with a co-worker who is also trying to stay away from red meat but really likes good flavor. Fair warning though you will find yourself going back for seconds!

I used canned chicken added a cup and a half of cooked minute rice I used a taco seasoning packet instead of the suggested seasoning and layered the dish. I did not use the cheese soup. Instead I put a layer of the mixture then a shredded cheese layer then a tortilla layer then the chicken mixture again shredded cheese tortilla and for the final layer I added more cheese on top of the last tortilla layer. It worked perfectly. I will make this again and I have shared the recipie with a couple of friends who loved the cassorole. Thank you.",

Dish is tasty a little spicy even though I purchased only mild ingredients. Otherwise had great taste. Cooked the chicken in some olive oil then used that juice for the rest of ingredients instead of using the water recipe called for. It had plenty of liquid when it came out despite looking dry initially going into baking dish. Will make again with some minor modifications",
