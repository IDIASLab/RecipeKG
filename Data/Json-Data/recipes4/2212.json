I was taking these out camping so that I could cook them over the campfire so I baked my spuds in the oven for about 1/2 hour before assembling them (takes way less time and prevents them from burning). Once they were a little softened I peeled them and cubed them. I also added some yellow onion and some grated cheddar. I then wraped them up tightly in the foil and paked them in the cooler. Once we were out at the campfire I just cooked them on the grill rotating and flipping them regularly. Worked great!:)",

Also too much salt I'd half that next time too especially if not using unsalted butter. We added sour cream at the table to cut the saltiness so they were edible. These are not for people who are wanting a crispy skin. I love crispy skin but this was a nice change. Be careful when wrapping the potato that it is sealed very tightly. When you put them into the oven make sure the folded ends are pointing UP because the butter leaked out all over the bottom of the oven and smoked up the kitchen. I don't know why I didn't expect that. I would make this again just half the salt and garlic powder or use fresh garlic and sea salt. Thanks for the great idea it really made the potato more flavorful.",
