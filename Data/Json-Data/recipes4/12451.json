Also crushed the rosemary and sauteed the vegetables in olive oil before adding the canned tomatoes. Next time I'll cook the chicken breasts whole and remove them as soon as they are done to avoid overcooking refrigerating and cubing chicken when cool. I'll simmer the stew longer to to meld the flavors and add the cut up chicken and drained beans at the end. Some minced fresh parsley would go well in this dish. Might be interesting to use ground chicken to create a consistency similar to chili.",

It looks like I'm the only one who made it exactly as written (both in terms of ingredients and cooking method). The beans were nowhere done after 2 hours, and still not done after 3. After 3:45, the beans were soft enough to eat, however they probably could have gone a bit longer. I don't understand the \"cook until chicken is soft\" part; I'm guessing this is an error and it should say \"beans\", not \"chicken\". I'm glad I halved the recipe, because this makes A LOT. So much so that a full recipe would not have fit into my large 6 quart pot. Expect a full recipe to make at least 12 large servings. The result was quite bland and I couldn\u2019t even taste the rosemary. I ended up adding more rosemary and threw in some garlic salt for extra flavor, but it was still missing something. I would suggest anyone who tries this use broth instead of water. Lastly, to thicken, don't just \"stir in cornstarch\" - you will end up with clumps. You will need to make a slurry with equal parts of cornstarch and cool water and stir that into the stew, a little at a time.",
