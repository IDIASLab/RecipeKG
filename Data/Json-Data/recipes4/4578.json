I bake them for about an 45 minutes to an hour at what ever tempurature the other dish is cooking at you can sqeeze them to see if there are tender. I see that you vent the foil if you don't vent you will not need the ice cube I also add pepper. If I am baking a chicken recipe I use a chicken bouillon instead of beef. Also make sure you put them in a oven safe dish in case any of them leak. Another tip is pre- cook the onions a little bit with the seasoning & butter in the microwave in a glass baking dish then take them out and cover dish with foil and finish cooking them in the oven.",

Sweet onions produce plenty of their own liquid and, as another reviewer suggested, add fresh cracked pepper.  Yum.",

I cut the tablespoon of butter into quarters and used 1/4 to rub the outside of the onion before sprinkling the garlic powder over it for added flavor. The butter added just the right amount of liquid added with the juice of the onion. I cooked at 350 for 45 min and turned up to 400 for another 15 min. They were just oh-so-perfectly cooked. (with an ever-so-slight 'crunch' to them) We used the leftover for our breakfast omelette the next morning!!!! YUMMY! Will definitely make again and again and again!!!",
