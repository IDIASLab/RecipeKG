                "reviewBody": "I believe that this recipe is incorrect as written, with the water and rice quantities reversed -- it should be 1 cup wild rice and 2-1/2 cups water. There isn't anywhere close to enough liquid in this recipe to properly cook 2-1/2 cups of wild rice and also moisten all of that bread.\n\nWith that change, this is a 5 star recipe, and I don't normally even like stuffing.\n\nSome other minor modications that I make:\n\nI cook the rice in the chicken broth plus 1 cup of water (don't drain any excess after cooking the rice), then add the rest of the water at the end. That seasons the rice more effectively.\n\nI also reduce the salt and pepper slightly, 1-1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper, and use low sodium chicken broth. I love salt (my wife thinks I use too much), but this recipe is just a bit too heavy on salt without those changes.\n\nI also simplify some of the quantities to 2 medium onions, 4 large stalks celery, 8 oz mushrooms, and 12 slices of bread. The result is about the same as the quantities (in cups) shown, but I think this makes shopping and prep easier.\n\nWhen combining the final mixture, add additional water (up to about 2 more cups) until the mixture is well moistened but there is no standing liquid.",

On this one get rid of the whole wheat bread and use 3 cups brown rice (uncooked) no mushroomes no raisins Saute the celery & onions in a large stock pot using enought water/chickent broth to cook this much rice add sausage seasonings apples (finely chopped) to rice mixture and mix well. You can serve on the side without the mess of stuffing the birds and just keep warm in a casserole dish to serve buffet style. Expect it to go fast.",

I did use chicken broth to cook my rice in and I did reverse the rice and liquid measurements. I used Johnsonville's All Natural Ground Mild Sausage which was perfect with this. Otherwise I followed the directions as given. This makes a really good side dish year round when you are having roast chicken or the half breast turkey that we have so often. Thanks for a wonderful dish. I wish they would fix the recipe so that others would know about the error! Thanks Christy!",
