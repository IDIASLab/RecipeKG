This one took only a few ingredients and had a good flavor. I used cream of celery soup instead of mushroom because my son doesn't like mushrooms. I cooked three cup of macaroni but didn't use it all. I mixed the soup and cheese in my 2 qt. casserole dish and added macaroni until the dish was full. Not all the macaroni would fit and I think it might have turned out a bit dry if I had added it all. I think 2 generous cups would be enough for a 2 qt casserole dish. The recipe did not say what size dish to use. I thought the flavor was quite good considering the recipe doesn't call for much in the way of seasoning. We added salt at the table to our individual taste. The crispy onions on top are a great addition which we all enjoyed. I will make this again.",
