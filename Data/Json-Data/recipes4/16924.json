I started browning the bacon with the garlic (increased to 2T) added 1/2C chopped onion and used a whole jalapeno (with seeds chopped). When satisfied with the color I deglazed the cooker with the beer (I used Corona) then poured the rest of the beer in and added a tablespoon of cumin. I let that simmer for about 5 mins. I'm a big fan of layering flavors. I had just been to a local farm and bought fresh butter beans which I added in with the water but increased it to 6C. My cooker has a button for beans which is 14 mins so I used that to start the cooking. At 14 mins the beans were just almost there but while I could taste the start of some good flavor it was really bland. I added 2T pinto bean seasoning 1T cumin 1t salt 1t garlic salt and turned it back on for 5 mins. The flavors came out really good. This is a good base recipe but next time I think I'll just double everything (inluding the jalapeno!) and use a whole onion instead of half. I also would throw in a ham hock or tasso but I was all out...",

Instead, I added a cup of liquid and cooked them an extra 5 minutes. If you have gastric distress with lima beans, don't skip the soaking overnight part which reduces the chemicals that cause the distress. Instead of 4 cups of water, I substituted 2 14.5oz cans of low salt chicken broth plus 1 cup of water. A 14.5oz can contains a little less than 2 cups of broth. The second time I cooked this recipe, I used a whole jalapeno pepper instead of 1/2. The next time I cook it, I'll probably use 2 peppers.",
