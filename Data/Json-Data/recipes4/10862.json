When they are half baked, and the pan is sizzling hot, pour your Yorkshire batter over the top and let them finish baking.  DO NOT open the oven.  They will puff up beautifully.  It also helps to make your batter in advance and let it sit mixed on the counter at room tempertaure to ensure a BIG puff.",

The crust does not get high depending on how you beat your eggs.  The crust gets high if #1 you leave your batter out on the counter for at least 30 minutes and #2 if you pour it into a very hot, sizzling dish with fat that is smoking hot on the bottom.    I'd increase the temperature of the oven to 425 degrees and make sure you use a metal pan, not glass.  Overall, this is a good, basic recipe for TITH and keep in mind that it is a British dish, which is historically not overly spicy or flavorful.  This is comfort food at its best.  Cover it with a nice brown gravy, some mashed potatoes, peas and carmelized onions.  Delicious.",

This was pretty much as Toad in the Hole should be although I found the batter a little on the heavy side and not as light and fluffy as my mum's TitH. Maybe I will use a little less flour next time. Also I'm finding it really hard to find good sausages in the US. Even the 'English style' bangers from my British food store in Dayton OH are not terribly good... Anyhoo we had it with buttery mashed potatoes peas and home-made gravy. A nice reminder of home.",
