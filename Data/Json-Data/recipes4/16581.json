The only issue I have is that the author didn't advise if the zucchini have to be squeezed. Without that the waffles are way too soft. I add 1/4 to 1/3 cup tapioca starch to get that crispiness that we expect from waffles and make up for extra fluid from the shredded zucchini. Also I used unsweetened flax milk and rice milk in place of soy. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you!",
