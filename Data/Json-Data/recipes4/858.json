I added the cayenne bit by bit and tasted after each addition. My husband ate two big bowls. I had one he's taking a bowl to work today and tomorrow--that's all we have left! Fabulous!

Obviously, those that prefer more of a kick should add more cayenne pepper after tasting.  For me, the kick was perfect; just enough to to let one know that it's \"there,\" but not so strong as to be overwhelming.  For those that might not be familiar with this style soup, it is similar to clam chowder--but with nuance of it's own.  Five stars if ever there was a five-star soup!",

Also rather than the cayenne white pepper and thyme I simply used a Cajun seasoning to taste. I used pasteurized lump crab meat. This comes together quickly uses simple ingredients and really delivers - this is a rich velvety smooth creamy and distinctly seafood flavored soup decadently delicious with big chunks of crab.

As I was making this for the party and had lots of other food prep work to do I took this recipe through step 1 several hours ahead of time transfering the simmered mixture to a slow cooker on low to keep it hot. Added the crab meat onions and cream just before the guests arrived. Couldn't be happier. Thanks!",
