                "reviewBody": "I liked this version of coconut mango rice because it was super easy, and I rarely have much time to spend on a side-dish/dessert.  Only substitute was coconut oil because I don't have grape-seed oil.  The flavor was delicious, too, especially with the cream of coconut I drizzled on the top. (Oh man!) However, I like mine sweeter, so next time I'll be adding at least another Tbsp. of sugar as suggested \"add more to taste\" in the recipe.  But my only real complaint was that the rice seemed a bit harder than what I enjoy at restaurants, so I might try adding an extra 1/8 cup of water or even shortening the toasting of the rice time to see if that helps.  But all in all, good recipe!  I'll definitely be making this again!",
