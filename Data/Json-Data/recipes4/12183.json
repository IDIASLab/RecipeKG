I was afraid of the amount of salt so I did make a few adjustments: Used only 1 bullion cube a quart of low salt chicken broth and only 2 quarts of water. I also used cracked pepper crusted bacon (yum!)I didn't add any extra salt or pepper. At the end I added a few pinches of cayenne and a couple dashes of cajun seasoning. I cooled it and refrigerated it overnight to let the flavors meld together. Great soup!!!",
