Even before I began making this recipe I was wondering why on earth you would need 6 cups of cooking liquid to cook a small roast in a slow cooker. The recipe never did say what to do with that liquid after the pork roast was cooked - were you supposed to discard it or add it back into the pot? I discarded most (5 cups) of it and felt like I wasted good beef stock and coffee but otherwise we would have had barbecued pulled pork soup. In the end the pork tasted fine like shreddd pork in barbecue sauce but nothing out of this world. I'm sure there's another pulled pork recipe out there that will suit my tastes more. Sorry.",
