I fried everything in a pan and then transferred the ingredients in a slow cooker to finish. I used stewing beef. Instead of using five spice I used 1 teaspoon of a blend of 3 spices (star anise, fennel and coriander). I put the lemongrass in the food processor so it blended in with the stew and added mixed vegetables instead of just carrots. I did not add extra water since there was plenty from the canned tomato. I realized after we ate that I forgot to add ginger-which I will put into the stew next time I give this recipe a try. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It will be a new staple for our family.",

I made a couple substitutions...I used diced tomatoes with green chilies to add a bit of spice, I nuked 1/2 an apple and mashed it for the apple sauce, I added beef broth instead of water, and I did not have any lemon grass to use.  The apple manages to come through in the sauce adding a slightly sweet finish.  Just really delicious and unique set of flavors.  Can\u2019t wait for leftovers!",
