The only difference is that I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, water instead of milk and freshly ground pepper. I also added a couple of tablespoons of ketchup. I rarely measure things when I cook and I had more than a pound of meat, but I probably used more Worcestershire sauce than what is called for here because of the addition of ketchup. For the gravy, I removed the patties to a plate after I browned them and used the same skillet that I browned the patties in, to brown the mushrooms and onions as I did not want to waste the yummy brown bits that add so much flavor to the gravy. I did not use the onion soup/water, I just used low sodium beef broth. I put the patties and gravy in a covered casserole dish and I finished mine in the oven. I had it at 350 degrees for about a half hour. Cooking times are going to vary depending on the size/thickness of your patties, the type of pan and the way your stove works, so I cannot rate any recipe according to whether or not it was done in the time stated, there are way too many variables. We're having the leftovers tonight!",
