I was looking for a cream of mushroom soup recipe but didn't have most of the ingredients called for. Using what I had on hand, I came up with this; great for winter or fall days! It cooks in one pot and is my go to recipe when I don't have much time! I call it stroganoff soup because it reminds me of my mom's stroganoff. My husband calls it his favorite!",
