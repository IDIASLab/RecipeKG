After the pork chops are tender, remove to a heated plate.  Leave the cover off the pan and sprinkle the onions with a little white sugar.

I also added extra onion and would suggest a minimum of 2 - could be more if you like onions.\r\n\r\nThe chops cooked so well with the steam able to \"escape\", that I did not have to leave the lid off at any time.\r\n\r\nEnd result????

Here are the changes I made: I used pork loin chops, sprinkled them on both sides with salt, pepper, sweet paprika and cajun seasoning.  I browned them on both sides in olive oil removed them from the pan, added a little more oil and added the onions.  I sprinkled a little sugar over the onions and covered them to simmer for about 5 minutes. I uncovered them and continued cooking them until they turned a beautiful brown. Add the meat back in and cover with 2 cups of chicken broth and simmer for about 20-30 minutes. Right before I was ready to serve them, I removed the meat and onions, made a gravy with the liquid, put the meat and onion back in and after it all thickened up, I served it over white rice. YUM, YUM, YUM!!!\nThanks for the recipe.",

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used a little more onion (1 and 1/2 onions)as well as the advice to remove the chops after 40 minutes and then carmalizing the onions with a bit of sugar.  I turned the heat up to speed up the carmalization.  I will be using this recipe often and may try different herbs with it and also will try the suggestion of apple juice in place of water. I love recipes that are easy to try variations. I use many great recipes from this site and this one is a big winner with me.",
