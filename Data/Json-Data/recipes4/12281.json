Also add 8  sausages links (I use pork) cut in half and added to the beef mixture about 10 mins before end of simmering time. You can make a gravy to serve with if required. Other than that it is perfect. Well done.",

I sauteed it covered in EVOO w/ chopped garlic/onion (for about 30 mins to make sure it was tender). Made the basic brown gravy packet on the side. Added frozen corn/green beans that I microwaved a minute in butter - to the concoction. I made a bag of flavored instant mashed potatoes. Put the meat/veg/gravy into a casserole dish. Topped it w/ the potatoes then cheese then finally the ready to go pie crust sprayed w/ Pam. Baked it for about 20 mins. on 350... It was teriffic! My kids totally ate it up and I'm sure the leftovers will be great tomorrow. Thanks for the great idea!",
