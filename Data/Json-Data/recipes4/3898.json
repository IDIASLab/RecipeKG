This is one of those sauces that you have to do to your tastes. I used one cup of light cream and brought it to a boil and let it reduce a bit. I used two to three ounces of gorgonzola cheese and about three tsp. of parmesan cheese. I added salt pepper nutmeg and a bit of cayenne. I added the crumbled bacon right to the sauce. I seasoned the filets as we usually do for grilling. Once they came off I poured a bit of the sauce over top then topped them off with sliced green onion. Perfect with grilled baked potaotes and a garden salad!",

I also add some sliced mushrooms near the end of cooking and increase the Gorgonzola a bit (okay and I add a bit of garlic... I love my garlic!). Make sure to use a nice high quality cheese. I tried it once with an amazing goat Gorgonzola and another time with a cheaper pre-crumbled variety. You can definitely taste the difference and I think I'd have to double the cheaper one to get the same flavour out of it.",
