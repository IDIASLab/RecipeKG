I'm by no means a vegetarian but was surprised how good it was and how much it filled me up.  \nMy adjustments:\nI'm too lazy to use fresh ginger so I used off the shelf stuff.  I didn't have red bell peppers or cilantro.  I used chunky peanut butter and substituted a can of tomatoes for the peppers (mostly drained).  \nDidn't miss what I left out, don't think fresh ginger is necessary, tomatoes worked just fine, and the extra texture from chunky peanut butter was a plus for me.  All good! :)\nI didn't get a burn warning but I'm about to make this for the second time...  I appreciate the tips from other cooks, in case I do run into that!",
