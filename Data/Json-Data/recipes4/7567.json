The only other change I will make the next time I make this is that I will drain and rinse the black beans but keep the liquid from the tomatoes and one of the cans of cannellini beans. I ended up adding more chicken broth than the recipe called for and would have preferred the thickness of the bean liquid instead. Everyone has their own preferred thickness when it comes to chili though so use your own judgement there. This was super simple with no fuss and you really can't go wrong with this recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "this is pretty much my usual chicken/turkey/ground beef quick chili - there are some things I do different I like a thicker base so I process a mix of cannelli northern white black beans into paste and add it to the broth. I also dont add sour cream to the pot I dollop on top when the chili is in it's bowl:) The thing with Chili though - is you have to make it to suit your tastes. My measurements for spices (usually by eye because it just works for me) are much different because I know my family's tastes... so look at your spices and decide to add or omit ramp the amounts up or tone them down. I'd try this on the stove first with leftover cooked chicken to get your spices and seasonings they way you want them to taste - and you can taste test as you cook to get them just right. This way you'll know what you like when you use the slow cooker method. Finally if you use the slow cooker and canned beans the slow cooker can make things a bit mushy if you want firmer beans add them later..... This recipe is a great guide to YOUR best chili. A Great Easy recipe! thanks for posting!",
