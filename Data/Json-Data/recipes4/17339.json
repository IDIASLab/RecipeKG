Nothing I tried online came close to this and I guess the secret is the right kind of rice, the right rice/water ratio and of course, plenty of butter and oil! Find yourself a good Lebanese yogurt marinade, grill some meats, and get a hold of some hummus. If you're from Southeast Michigan or anywhere else with a large Middle Eastern population, you will feel like you're eating at your favorite place! Trust me.",

It was nowhere near that yellow. I added about three times as many almonds as the recipe called for and I still think it could have used more. Next time I will probably add more salt too. It was a little bland for my taste (but I'm a salt-aholic). My husband and guests were very complimentary. I will definitely make this again.",

Our local Lebanese restaurant puts carrots in theirs so I dice up some carrots and put them in about halfway through with the rice cooking. Love the addition of some color and if I don't overcook the carrots just the slightest crunch people seem to like as well! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! A keeper for sure!:)",

The rice cooked as is, for sure, is fluffy and moist, but it\u2019s just rice. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth the extra effort compared to just a nice pot of rice cooked in stock with a few add-ins thrown in at the end.",
