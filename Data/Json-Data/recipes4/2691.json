The recipe was bit unclear as to how long to bake in the oven (for those of us without a meat thermometer). I checked mine at 10 min and it was VERY rare, but at 20 when I took it out it was pretty well done. I'll probably go with 15-18 minutes in the future. I also did add just a pinch of flour to help the sauce thicken up. Served with risotto cooked in toasted sesame oil, and it was very yummy.",

And the person who said it was tough from being overdone using less time probably undercooked it. I've found duck needs to be done at least close to medium to be tender. But it depends on the thickness. My close to one inch thick breast took a good 30 minutes. And I assumed the honey went in the sauce even though the recipe left out where to put it. Was enjoyed with garlic mash and carrots.",

Even with the tough meat of the legs the end result was still a very delicious tender meal. I served it with parsley potatoes and a spinach salad. I reccomend serving this with bread so you can soak up some of the delicious sauce. Also some other reviewers commented that the sauce was too salty. I guess you could say that it was rather salty but I did not feel that it was too salty. I think that it would be easy to adjust the ingredients; maybe a little bit less rice wine? Anyway I highly reccomend this recipe. Thanks for posting!",
