I mean I swear...the dog kept walking around with his nose in the air sniffing and when my husband walked thru the door he said \"Oh my God, that smells incredible!\" Here is what I did differently: I added seasoned salt and garlic powder to the flour/pepper mixture. I roasted the meat in the same pan that I browned it in. I did not use the wine called for. Instead I deglazed the pan with a can of undiluted beef consumme. I also added halved potatoes and carrots to the pot for the last hour. They were perfect-not mushy. I can honestly say I will never make a pot roast any other way.",

I upped my heat to 350 after the first hour. In the last hour and 10 minutes I added red potatoes and carrots. The consomm\u00e9 and flour from the meat made a slightly thick and full bodied gravy that was delicious over the meat slices and vegetables.

I couldn't give it a 5 because I changed some stuff in it... but it's definitely 5-star quality.\n\nI used onion gravy mix instead of onion soup since that's all I had. I had no vermouth, so I used the equal amount of water. I also rubbed some powdered garlic into the meat before flouring it. I also didn't cut off the fat before cooking since it added a bit of flavor (but definitely didn't serve it). I put carrots and potatoes in with the roast 2 hours after it was already in the oven.\n\nI let it cook for a total of 5 hours (give it take 20 minutes) at 275 degrees.

I seasoned my flour with a teaspoon on garlic powder, a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon on paprika. I put slits in my rump roast and added garlic like some of the others did. I also substituted cream of celery soup because the cream of mushroom always ends up tasting tinny and has a strong tapioca flavor to it and sherry in place of the vermouth. I cut 2 large turnips into quarters and sliced a bermuda onion into thick slices and arranged that around my roast before cooking. SinceI like my pot roast cooking all day, I lowered the heat to 250 degrees and cooked it for 5 hours. The end result is a tender roast with a very savory gravy.",

After searing all sides of the roast in the pan, I kept it in the pan and put it in the oven. I did not use wine, but a whole envelope of Lipton Onion Soup Mix and a can of beef broth. Two hours into baking, I added cut up onions, carrots and B red potatoes. Came out absolutely perfect and I'll never make a roast any other way. Thank you!",
