I did read the reviews ahead of time and knew to cook the potatoes a bit before adding them. I also added a bag of frozen peas and carrots and skipped the mushrooms. The other reviewers are correct that it makes WAY too much filling for the crust recipe provided, especially if you add extra vegetables. Do yourself a favor and double the dough so you can make two of these yummy pies! In preparation for a birthday party where I'm serving my son's favorite meals as appetizers, I actually made miniature pies in my muffin pans and ended up with six pies. They baked perfectly in the time and temperature for the regular pies and turned out great as cute little individual pies that popped right out onto the platter!",

                "reviewBody": "Truely fantastic recipe! I agree that the filling is enough for almost two pies, so cut back on the broth and flour. I used the called for amounts of veggies, but added an extra cup of chicken and some peas and broccoli.\n\nHere's what i did to solve the crunchy veggy problem: i boilied the raw chicken tenderlions in the chicken broth for about 10 min, then added the potatoes and carrots and cooked for another 5-7 min until they softened a bit. then i took the chicken out of the broth and used a large straining spoon to get the potatoes and carrots out, and poured the broth into the butter mixture and followed the recipe from there, adding 1/2 cup of whole milk at the end.\n\nAnd to solve the soggy bottom crust problem, i found the PERFECT cure! I used Pilsbury crust and put it in the oven while preheating. About 3 min after it had heated to 400, i took it crust out of the oven and let it cool for just a few minutes. Then i brushed egg whites on it (and on the top crust). Not at all soggy on the bottom - PERFECT!!\n\nThe only other modification i would make to the recipe is to use one potato to cut back on the filling. Or, perhaps it's possible to freeze/refridgerate the leftover filling to use later with some buttermilk biscuits?? yummy!\n\nPs - although i have once added a teeny bit of rosemary, i don't recommend it. cooking the chicken in the broth and adding the whole milk added that slight extra bit of flavor that i will now never try to change! Enjoy! :)",
