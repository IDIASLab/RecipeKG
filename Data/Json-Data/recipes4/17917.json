I think the cook time is a little too long though if you want to be able to slice it. Mine was so tender (not exactly a bad thing) that it fell apart when trying to slice it. The beer is a must so don't skip it. The next time I make this I will let the broth cool skim off the fat and find another use for it. It would make a killer Reuben Soup.",
