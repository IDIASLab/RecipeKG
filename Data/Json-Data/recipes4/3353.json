I actually followed the recipe closely (which is unlike me), except for sprinkling the chops with a shake of adobo seasoning before browning. Definitely use the BONE-IN chops. I always use boneless and was reluctant, but so glad I used the bone-in. They seem to be so much more flavorful and definitely less expensive. And my daughter (who is usu. pretending she is a  of wolf or some type of cat) loved gnawing on the bones! I served with extra chopped cilantro on the side and yellow Goya rice. My husband said the flavor was very Cuban, and the combo of the pork juices, salsa and black beans is unbelievably flavorful. Since I had so much leftover cilantro, I chopped it all up, wrapped it well and froze it for next time. Since you're using the cilantro for cooking, the flavor is the same, even if the appearance isn't. Saved me from buying another bunch of cilantro and throwing most of it out.",
