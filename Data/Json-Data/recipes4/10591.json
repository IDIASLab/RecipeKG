Self-rising flour was not on my shelf so I looked in a cookbook for another scone recipe it required 2t. baking powder so that is what I used before looking at the previous reviews on this recipe. When I bake these again I ll use 3t. baking powder and more parmesan. Sprinkling a bit of the cheese on top sounds like a good idea too. We thought the salt was just right but I used kosher salt and quality parmesan - don't know if that made the difference.",
