I made a few changes, such as omitting the jalapenos for personal preference, and I used a bit less ground pepper and chili pepper than were called for because I had never cooked with ground turkey before and didn't know how the flavor was going to be.  The mixture seemed a LITTLE too wet but cooked up just perfectly. The Meatballs were juicy and extraordinarly flavorful. The italian seasoning I think is what really made these great.  As I said, I wasnt sure how strong the flavor of the Turkey would be so I had reservations about what sort of Sauce I could serve these with.  I ended up doing a garlic and olive oil angel hair pasta, but the Meatballs could have gone REALLY well with a Creamy mushroom sauce or even a marinara.  I added an extra tablespoon of blue cheese and I still didnt think the flavor of the Blue cheese was very strong.. My father couldn't taste it at all! Will definitely add more next time and will DEFINITELY make these again and again.",

This is a fantastic, flavorful recipe that can be easily altered to suit your own tastes.\n\nMy wife and I are cooking more with turkey these days (sorry, beef!) and no flavor was lost by using it. I was a little skeptical about the blue cheese. (I love it and she hates it). One of the other reviewers said it was undetectable, and I would have to agree... my wife didn't complain one bit!\n\nI skipped the jalapenos simply because I didn't have any, but basically followed the rest of the instructions closely and can't think of anything I would change.\n\nWe'll make these again, maybe for a dinner party we have later this month.",

An additional 1/2 cup of bread crumbs did the trick. I really enjoyed this recipe. The ingredients were subtle and complemented each other well. I served the meatballs with a balsamic reduction along with sides of wilted spinach and pasta with homemade pesto sauce. YUM! On a sorry note, my husband and children are traditionalists and prefer the same old turkey meatballs I usually make (not your fault). They gave you between 1 and 3 stars. However, I gave you 5! Since my vote counts more (after all, I searched for recipe, made recipe, prepared appropriate accompaniments and took the time to review said recipe), I gave you an average 4 star rating. You did a great job and should be proud of this recipe. I am impressed that this was submitted by a 15 year old. I look forward to great things from you!",
