Any low quality processed cheese just isn't going to give you as delicious a casserole as a high quality cheese would. I did follow the recipe by cooking it in the microwave but I believe I will either use the oven or stovetop next time. I like the idea of just popping something in the microwave but the microwave has a tendency to render things stringy and rubbery so I think I could get a smoother casserole in the oven. In general I did enjoy this recipe though and I will make it again I'll just change up those two things.",

Overall, it was very good. I messed up a little and added salt, not realizing that the pre-cooked wild rice I was using was already seasoned. So, it was a little salty for my taste, but again, the recipe doesn't call for salt. :) The only other change was that I added some grated cheddar cheese, both to the dish and on top. I didn't measure, just threw in a handful. It made it very cheesy and rich. The family loved it and my daughter even asked if she could keep the leftovers at her house. So, I will definitely be making this again.",
