Of course, I did not add cheese or sour cream, but I beleive a dish should be able to stand on its own, with condiments only to enhance. This recipe is totally original, and I will definately make my version again. Thanks for the recipe!",

I say good, because I have had to tweak it a little to my taste. For example, it was too thick for me so I added some more tomatoes, including the liquid, and some chicken broth.  I also added some spices, like cumin, cilantro, and some more chili powder because it was a bit bland without it. \n\nAll in all, it is very filling, but healthy meal that is not expensive or time consuming to make.

However, the end-result was not b/c I followed the recipe exactly. Quite the contrary... I DID read the reviews thoroughly and used quite a few of them to make this top-notch chili a success!: 1) Add can of black beans, 2) Add can of corn, 3) Add 1 1/2 cans of diced tomatoes, 4)Add packet of taco seasoning, 5) Add 3x chili powder, 6) Add nearly a whole can of chicken broth (good for consistency and flavor), 7) Add 2 TBS worcestershire and 8) Add dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg to REALLY bring out the complexity of the pumpkin in this chili.
