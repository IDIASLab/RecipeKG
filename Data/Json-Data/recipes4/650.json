My final master piece is this:  I took 4 bags of organic fresh spinach (don't know the ounces, sorry.  Just got the pre-packaged stuff.)  Microwaved with some water for about 8 min.  Then drained and saut\u00e9ed to evaporate the water along with one clove of garlic.  I like garlic but not for breakfast.  Optional-I've added onion and mushrooms and saut\u00e9ed them along with the spinach.  Funny thing is the onion didn't make that much of a difference in taste so I've eliminated it.  Then i add only 6 ounces of 1/3 fat cream cheese (I don't think it needs a whole stick) I also only use a 1/4 or less of Parmesan cheese.  I don't like one flavor over powering a dish unless it is suppose to.  I used 2 egg whites instead of whole eggs.  Mix all the above.   I lay 5 slices of Muenster or mozz on the bottom, pour in the spinach and don't top it with more cheese-- it doesn't need it.  Bake as usual.  I found it's sometimes salty so watch which Muenster cheese you add.",

I used sliced Colby cheese instead of muenster and a 16 oz. bag of frozen spinach (which was thawed in the frig.) instead of two 10 oz. boxes. The garlic powder was omitted and 4 drops of Tabasco sauce used instead. I added 5 brown and serve \"light\" sausage that were heated up in the microwave first and then chopped up. I also beat the cream cheese with an electric hand mixer to make it smooth and beat the eggs in the same way. I layed it out as described in a 9 inch pie pan stirring the spinach sausage parmesan and seasonings into the cream cheese mixture. Baking time was 30 minutes. It was just terrific like this and I will be making it often.",
