The only change I made on this recipe is to use the Ritz cracker with garlic flavor, two eggs and cut down butter to \u00bc cup.   To give the baked pork chops a bit of crunchy taste, I followed other members\u2019 advice and remove the foil for the last 15 minutes in the oven.  I normally serve this dish with macaroni and cheese with a can of veggie.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.",

Instead of salt and garlic I sprinkled them with just Seasoning Salt and I only needed two beaten eggs to coat them. I crushed up about 2 cups of fat free seasoned croutons in my food processor and coated them with those. I love to use croutons instead of bread crumbs for extra crunch and flavor. I had about a half of stick of real butter left from my holiday baking so I dabbed that all over and poured the remaining croutons on top. I didn't flip them. They were nice and moist and quite tasty! Thanks!",
