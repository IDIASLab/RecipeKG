I sauteed some peppers and fresh minced garlic and browned the meat in that. Once brown I added the cr. of mushroom. I used onion buns and baked the open face style. I had the meat on one side and topped that with french fried onions. On the other side I put the cheese. I baked it at 350 for about five minutes to crunch up the onions and melt the cheese. Really tasty! Tastewise I'd give four stars (because I like to reserve five for really outstanding dishes). However it's so quick easy and FILLING that it gets five stars!!!",
