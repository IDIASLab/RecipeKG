First I boiled the chicken for about 15 minutes the cut it into huge chunks and threw it into a hand blender. It made it into small shreds but a nice uniform size and took a lot less time than hand shredding the chicken - I'm not a fan of chunks. At the same time I put basmati rice into a rice cooker so both the chicken and rice were done at the same time. Then I used half a can of cream of chicken and half a can of cream of mushrooms added a cup of mushrooms and a cup of chopped celery (which i sauteed while the rice and chicken were cooking) an extra 2 tablespoons of dill (I love the stuff) and 2 tablespoons of minced garlic. Also this recipe needs about 1/2 cup of milk and some major salt and peppering. This recipe is really growing on me. The more I eat it the more I really like it. Even though the Ritz crackers heat up mushy in the microwave it adds so much flavor I'm contemplating adding more. Plus I ate this at my desk today and someone followed me back to my desk by the SMELL!!!! Good stuff thanks. Great make ahead and freeze or save for the rest of the week-type meal.",

I did use 1 soup can full of milk on the suggestion of other's reviews as well as about 1/2c chopped onion. Oh! and the topping I used garlic butter flavored Ritz crackers and my hubby who IS NOT a casserole type of guy loved it and actually ASKED for the leftovers the next day.

Peas are a nice addition to the rice or once set up and ready for the oven I lay out broccolli spears and whole skinned tomatos to give it a color contrast. I use this as one of my buffett dishes.

I also made this up the night before and refrigerated then put on toppings and popped it in the oven (I needed one hour at 350 but also made a larger recipe).

When chicken was done I drained broth and shredded using two forks---it's so tender this way!!!! Used basmati rice and cooked while chicken was cooking. Added extra dill and seasoned with seasoning salt and pepper to suit our tastes. Used extra Ritz on top--they're so yummy! Also sauteed some celery and onion in olive oil and added to the mixture.
