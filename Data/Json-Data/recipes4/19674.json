Can also be cooked on the stovetop. Add a variety of extra veggies for a healthier, more filling meal. Top with cheese and serve with crusty garlic bread, grilled chicken, or a fresh salad. And of course a big glass of wine!",

Obviously it could use a little more but it is what it is. The spinach got overcooked for me so next time I'd add it to the water after the noodles were cooked and let it soak for a minute or so before draining. I typically always add spinach to my ramen noodles. It gives them some color and incorporates some freshness to them. Again this is a great recipe for a dorm where the microwave is the only thing available.",
