We probably would have been satisified with half a sandwich (rather than a whole) because it is so rich and decadent. The apple lends a nice crunch to this sweet and wonderful combination of ingredients. Don't change a thing on this and do use the cinnamon-raisin bread as I think it's important. Now I have to find something else to make with the leftover dulce de leche (other than eating it by the spoonful out of the can).",
