I have left the original review here but after waking up from my nap the one I had melted at low heat had firmed up far better than the higher heat one. It had some congealed fat visible on it but not as much as I would have expected and when it was cut up it was not a problem. Still far from my favorite fudge but the ease of making it makes it worthwhile I think. previous review I made this with Ghirardelli 60% cocoa chocolate chips. I made two batches. The first seized up s the fat separated from the rest and I ended up with very greasy fudge. I thought maybe medium (I used setting 5 out of 12 settings on my cooktop so it was a low-medium) was too hot so I made it on setting 1. It did the exact same thing. I'm not sure what I could do differently so I think I will use a more traditional recipe next time.",

I cook for 30 seconds at a time and then mix put back in microwave and re do until all is melted and well incorporated. It is much easier than cooking on stove top which i have been know to scorch from time to time. I then put it in the fridge to get it to set up faster as my family can not wait 2 to 3 hours for it to harden i hope this helps those that have had some trouble",
