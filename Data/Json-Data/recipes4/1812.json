Fresh thyme was a huge plus...I also used fresh goat's milk feta cheese which added an amazing tangy flavor. Update 06/23/07: After 3 years my husband and I count down the days until cold weather to make this soup. It is always great the first day but gets better and better every time you re-heat it. The most important of aspect(s) of this recipe? Always use fresh garlic herbs and fresh spinach. You will not be disappointed. I always make a special trip to the 'natural' food store for the goats milk feta cheese also...pure heaven.",
