I've already left out the onions and just use onion powder which works well for me, but I'm not a big fan of onion to begin with. The moisture from the veggies and the olive oil combine with the seasonings to make the most amazing thick juice on the bottom of the pan, which is why I am now a oevn-roasted veggie convert: I love to dip my bread in it. Some have commented they'd prefer using a smaller pan, but I feel the 13x9 allows this amount of veggies optimum room to roast separately in the oven and not just be a baked veggie casserole. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, while I may change the seasonings or even the veggies themselves I feel the proportions and cook time/temp are perfect!",

I used one zucchini, about 10 grape tomatoes halved, omitted the onions and 3 teaspoons of chopped garlic from the jar.  We love garlic.  I added the parmesan cheese before baking and mixed that in as well.  And for an extra kick I added about a half tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.  I think that really made it.  I didn't have fresh basil so I used a couple of the frozen basil cubes from Trader Joe's and threw them in before I put this in the oven and mixed it all together.  I baked at 450 for 10 minutes and it came out perfect.",

                "reviewBody": "I liked the idea of this,  but after reading the recipe through, I knew right away the oven temperature and cooking time were excessive.  I cut my zucchini in larger chunks than the recipe called for and baked it at 400 degrees for 10 minutes; then broiled for a minute or two to get some nice color.  The zucchini was perfectly cooked, although my tomatoes and onions were still over-cooked.  Part of the problem was that I had to use grape tomatoes (no fault of the recipe)  since we cannot get a decent tomato in Ohio this time of year.  The remedies that come to mind are to add tomatoes and onions later in the cooking process, maybe last five minutes.  Or use full size tomatoes and quarter them as indicted in the recipe and cut onion into larger pieces.  All in all this is a good recipe that just needs a little more tweaking.",
