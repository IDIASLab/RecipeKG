I would like to try the recipe in a 9 x 13 casserole dish and cut into smaller servings to feed a crowd. I think next time I will not use the yolk to brush the crust  and instead use an egg white wash.  I may add some finely chopped onion to the filling next time. The Italian sausage I used did not have an over powering flavor of fennel and we liked that as we are not big fans of strong fennel.  Served this with a side of fresh fruit salad.  It is a keeper!
