I put the Turkey with the Brine in a food grade bucket overnight for 14hrs. Removed it from the solution on Thanksgiving day & placed it in a huge colander & rinsed the access brine from the turkey. Pat dried it & stuffed it with apples & coated the skin with unsalted butter & sprinked some pepper & seasoning salt on the outside. Placed it in the roaster & added about 2 cups of chicken stock to the bottom of the roaster. The turkey cooked surprisingly in 2hrs. It was perfect & the family just loved it:)",

Since the brine kit I purchased from the store required a medium boil then cooling then add to turkey procedure I added brown sugar apple cider (required by the brine kit) a little bit of maple syrup celery poultry seasonig dried thyme leaves dried rosemary bay leaves celery seeds pepper chicken soup base carrots onion & garlic to the brine kit when it started to boil. The kit came with a brine bag. After the above mentioned cooled I added this to the turkey with 6 quarts of cold water & 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar (required by the brine kit). In all honesty other than the extra ingredients I added (and the brine kit) I used this recipe as my anchor and I purchased the brine kit out of desperation because all of the kosher salt had been sold out. Now let's get back to my next steps. I placed my turkey in a cooler with ice (too big to fit in the refrigerator) for 24 hrs. My 20.5 lbs. Turkey cooked in 3-1/2 hours. I was told by my entire family that this was the best turkey they ever had. The turkey was moist (even the breast!) and everyone wanted leftovers! Thanks! Great brine & will use again next year!",
