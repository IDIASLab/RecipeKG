Bad idea (at least with this recipe) because it had turned to mush by the end.  And I was unsure how to trim it so I ended up cutting off the stems completely...which left me with barely any broccoli rabe once it was done cooking. Despite this the recipe still came out good and everyone loved it.  I wouldn't suggest cutting the butter any as it was a key component to the sauce.  I had to add a little cornstarch to mine to thicken it but I think that was a result of not enough broccoli rabe. I'm sure I'll have better luck next time. And I used crumbed sausage links, but I would highly reccomend the bulk sausage as suggested in the recipe.",

Used regular broccoli since I had it on hand and it worked out great! Be sure to cook your pasta to JUST al dente so that it can soak up all that rich sauce from the pan.
