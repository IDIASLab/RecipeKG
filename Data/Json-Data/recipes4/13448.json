When cooking my garlic & onions I added in a few handfuls of pancetta. Also added 2 bay leaves some basil and extra garlic. The sauce was left to simmer for 2.5 hours & came out with a nice tangy flavor. It tasted great but it really didn't taste like the vodka sauce I usually make & I think some were disappointed a bit. However it was good & worth trying...:)",
