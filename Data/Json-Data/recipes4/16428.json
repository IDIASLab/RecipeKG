Added about 1/2 cup water.  Covered and cooked on high for 1 hour, then low for 7 hours. It made a lot of gravy/broth that was delicous and I didn't really want to throw it out.  So after taking the pork out onto a platter to shred, I emptied the broth into a measuring cup that allows fat to separate. \nI shredded the pork and added back to the crockpot  and about a cup of the broth to moisten it a bit.  Added a 24 oz bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and cooked together until hot again about 1 hour.\nSimply delicous! It was just enough BBQ sauce to flavor but not over power it. Served it on Hawaiian slider rolls. Yum!\nOnly thing I did differently was add back some of the broth instead of throwing it away. \nWill definitely make again!",

I added the entire bottle of sauce, cooled it and refrigerated it.  Sunday morning I put it in a disposable foil pan and covered it with foil and baked at 350 for about an hour.
