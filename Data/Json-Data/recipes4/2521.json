Fix this with mashed potatoes and biscuits and you have a meal fit for a king. Like me you will swear off TV dinners forever. I served the very easy to prepare \"Red Hot Biscuits\" from the allrecipes website. With the mashed potatoes I just can't tell you how good it tasted. Even though I only had two cups of milk and had to substitute chicken broth for the rest of the milk the consistency and flavor of the gravy was primo.
