The next morning I rinsed the split peas and placed them into the crock pot and poured the contents of the freezer bag on top.  Turned the crock pot on low and went to work.  Came home to a wonderful meal!  Will definitely make more to keep in the freezer!",

I added more liquid (though that didn't seem to really be an issue in the first place but I thought it might help) and another 12 hours go by - CRUNCHY PEAS. I've turned the heat up on the crockpot to high b/c I think that might be the only way to fix it. I don't want to waste the ingredients by throwing it out. It's useless as it is now though. I had been keeping it on low b/c it was not being supervised (first away from the house for 8 hours then overnight while we slept). Now that I'll be home to watch it all day I will see if high helps. If not - I may have to change my review to 1 star. I only gave it 2 so far b/c the flavor & idea of the soup is okay - the problem was execution.",

Even so it was a very hearty soup; probably doesn't need the potatoes and ham but I bet it's good with it. My only note is the bacon probably adds salt and flavor; it was a tad on the bland side for me but since I didn't add the bacon I figure that is my fault. I did have an interesting dilemma with the time frame; it was on all day on low but nowhere near done when I got home so I jacked it up to high and it was done after two hours on high. So for those who are having issues with lack of cooking try different temps on your slow cooker. This makes loads of soup; we just finished it this week and made it earlier last week.

Some changes: instead of potatoes I used cauliflower instead of chicken broth I used veggie broth I pumped up the spices with cumin garum masala and tumeric and blended 1/3 of the soup for a more creamy consistency (since I had no starch from the potatoes). Also Instead of adding the bacon at the beginning I cooked the bacon in a skillet in the last hour and a half separated the fat from the bacon spooned a couple of teaspoons in the soup and used the crispy bacon bits as garnish for the end result. It's atypical for me to use bacon at all in a meal but it really made this dish something special. Never had a split pea soup so tasty and I'm proud to say I made it!",
