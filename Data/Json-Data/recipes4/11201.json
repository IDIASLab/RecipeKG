I was skeptical about the \"sauce\" but it turned out pretty tasty.The sauce thickened enough to serve over pasta but since we're not big pasta fans I wanted to serve it without. For this reason I thickened it up some more with cornstarch. I also added peas for extra color and flavor. It was very delicious. I believe I may make it again but perhaps I'll use chicken broth in place of the water a dash more white wine some white pepper and some garlic powder.I think the potatoes add enough starch without the need for the pasta.

I was in total agreement with Maggie about not using pasta with this dish since we were using potatoes. I followed Maggie's ideas exactly using chicken broth instead of water adding peas and thickening it at the end with cornstarch and water. It was great and would be good for an informal gathering. Easy to make. Serve with a salad and French or Italian bread to mop up the thickened sauce! P.S. Watch the onions - they cooked much faster than the sausage and I had to take them out earlier before they burned and left a burned taste in the dish.",

Now I'm a potato lover but for the life of me I cannot understand why if you were going to leave out one of the starches that it would be the pasta. Without the pasta it would be like a big blob of meat on the plate. Almost like a sloppy joe without a bun. I too chose to leave out a starch but I chose the potato. I felt the dish needed the bed of pasta for visual appeal. It still isn't a beautiful dish but the bed of pasta sure helped. Because I did not use the potatoes I ended up sprinkling the hot mixture with a dusting of flour to help thicken the sauce. I also chose not to add my cooked chicken until the sauce was done. I've never been a fan of frying something up nice and crisp just to turn around and sog it up. After the sauce was done I stirred in the browned chicken and served immediately. I thought this turned out pretty good and had plenty of flavor. If I were to make it again I would use all wine instead of the water though. I almost forgot that I had a couple of mushrooms that needed used and I threw them in with the sausage. Mushrooms work nice in this too.",
