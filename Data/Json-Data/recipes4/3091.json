A pkg of taco seasoning goes a long way if that's what you're used to. Taste the meat mixture before you make the burrito's...add seasoning accordingly. This is a 15 minute recipe, it's not meant to be gourmet, but if you're looking for a quick, filling recipe, this is good. As the description says, it's a basic recipe.  Jalapeno cheese, salsa, and sour cream make an excellent addition in my opinion.  ",

This was my first time making burritos ever. I basically followed the recipe exactly except that I added a few things. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef used the oregano and garlic powder as well but I added my own favorite seasoning which is goya adobo all purpose seasoning with pepper to give it more flavor. As well as a cheap taco seasoning which I picked up at the local supermarket. On top of the refried beans I added canned black beans and some white rice I previously made. I think it came out great I'll definitely make it again. I also have enough to last practically all week. And instead of store bought tortillas I made my own from scratch with a recipe from this site. They came out perfect I'm really proud for it to be my first time.",
