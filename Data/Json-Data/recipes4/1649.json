However I only use about 2 Tbsp real butter (no margarine) because using the full amount leaves a greasy taste. I also use Campbell's Beef Broth/Double Strength to give it a rich flavor. By draining the canned mushrooms they absorb more of the beefy flavor from the broth and onion soups. By the way use the soups full strength from the can; do not add water. Thanks for the recipe; I'm making a double recipe now to take to a church potluck tomorrow. When it finishes baking I'll refrigerate it overnight then put it in my crockpot at church in the morning and let it heat in the kitchen until it's time to eat.",
