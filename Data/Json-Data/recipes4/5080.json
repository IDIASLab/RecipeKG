I increased the vegetables a bit and sauted them in a pan-sprayed skillet before putting them in the glass loaf dish. I know I just made more work for myself but I like the browned flavor. Also the Egg Beaters are kind of expensive so I just separated a dozen eggs which I think made about the same volume. Now I just need to figure out what to do with the yolks. Anyway it seemed to work just fine. I also added a sprinkle of granulated garlic to the eggs along with a splash of hot sauce. I loved cooking the omelet this way.

I also used a combination of red and green pepper along with a bit of tomato and garlic. Watch your microwave times as they do vary. Once this was done I topped it with a bit of light cheddar cheese and wrapped it in a warm tortilla for \"breakfast on the go\". This is a great base to add-in whatever you like and there's a number of flavors of Egg Beaters so get creative! Thanks DONNA!",

And just for the record I've never gotten why folks buy and use egg beaters. All you have to do is use a real egg - just separate the yolk from the whites and use only the whites. This is basically all egg beaters are except they throw in guar gum and xanthan gum and flavoring - yuck! If you want a heartier omelet use two egg whites and one whole egg. Most people can handle one yolk and that's where the iron is if you're looking to add some iron to your diet. Enjoy!",

You can LOAD fhis with almost any variety of veggies for very few calories. A personal favorite of mine is onion a ton or so of mushrooms zucchini and spinach and I mix it up regularly so as not to get bored and use them liberally. Sometimes I add a piece or two of thin-cut crumbled bacon or a bit of finely diced lean ham for flavor ( 50 calories). A sprinkle of less than a tablespoon of a flavorful cheese (shredded Parmesan sharp cheddar feta or bleu for example) goes a long way in a simple dish. Also lots of herbs and spices mixed with the eggs all to suit your own preference add much to the flavor and healthfulness of the meal without adding fat or calories. I often use salt fresh ground black pepper fresh parsley granulated onion minced garlic a pinch of cayenne and a bit of turmeric. These also add a little more color to make the plate more visually appealing. Too and especially since I can get an 18-pack of eggs where I live for roughly 1.25 right now I just crack and separate the eggs whites myself; not that there is anything wrong with using a prepared product if you find it affordable and convenient. Lastly guests who might balk at \"just egg whites?!\" (lol) may respond better to a ratio of one whole egg to every two or three whites. Still a good healthy option and they will likely soon discover that they don't miss the familiar w",
