I used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and added two teaspoons of diced garlic.  I cut the cumin to avoid the \"chili\" comments a few had shared.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  I served this over brown rice, again because it's a whole grain, and it was so yummy.  Great recipe that you can throw together in a few minutes and allow to cook all day.  I did 8 hours on low and then it was on warm for about 2 hours.  It was perfect.",

I used 2 cans of tomato sauce, one can of diced tomatoes, 2 cans of beans (non-drained) and one additional can of beans (drained).  Don't add the water- let the liquid from the beans and the tomatoes be the broth!  I cooked this on the stove in a big pot in about an hour and a half- no problems.  Also- wait to add the cabbage until you're about halfway done, and definitely add about a full head of cabbage.  This was great and we will be enjoying this again- thanks!",

                "reviewBody": "Thanks for sharing this recipe!!! I've made it over and over again since I first stumbled upon it, and my whole family loves it. I'm giving it 5 out of 5 stars because it's a great concept and it lead me to a new family favorite; but in my opinion it needs a few adjustments. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and we found it to be a little overpowering. Since then, I make it with the following changes: I use half the cumin, half the pepper, one 16 oz. can of kidney beans, one 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, two 14 oz. cans of chicken broth, and no water. I also added 1/2 tsp. each of garlic powder and onion powder. This suits our tastes much better and makes the soup alot less chili-like. I also leave out the oil because I don't see a need for the added calories/fat, and have found that leaving it out doesn't take anything away from the soup. To make this recipe in alot less time: Fry the hamburger and onion in a large soup pot until browned, drain, and put back in the same pot. Add all of the other ingredients to the pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to med-low and cover with a lid. Simmer for 1/2 hour to 45 minutes or until the cabbage is tender, stirring occasionally. Serve and enjoy :)",

Those who like cilantro thought it a fantastic addition. This is a low cost and satisfying meal.
