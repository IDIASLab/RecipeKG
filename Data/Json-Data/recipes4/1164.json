I did have a couple small problems that I will keep in mind when making this again. The butter although only 1 Tbs. is not necessary and only adds to the bacon grease that pools on the top/sides. I had to drain A LOT of grease from these before taking to the table. I didn't use 18 slices of bacon closer to 12 but should have expected this. The baking time was approx. 20 min longer in my oven and could have stood 5 - 10 min longer but everything else was done and waiting so I just went with it. The bacon on the bottom was not crisp or brown at all. Next time I think I will just arrange the bacon across the top. I will also add more cheese next time. The fontina got a little lost. Most of these things can be fixed easily and as much as everyone commented on these I will definately be making them again. Thanks for sharing!",
