We hopped online to find directions that used only ingredients we had around the house. This one fit the bill.\nOur first attempt at the humble pavlova (a New Zealand tradition), it turned out really well and was delicious. \nWith helpful suggestions from friends, the key to the pavlova is adding the sugar in bit by bit, not disturbing it once it is in the oven and of course decorating it later with fresh whipped cream, strawberries and kiwifruit.\nThanks for saving Christmas!",

I was a little scared of the multiple textures at first but was able to salvage a good half of my creation to serve. I made it without super fine sugar because I didn't have any which may have contributed to it being ultra-sweet. I'd love to try this made by someone who does it all the time.",

You can grind normal white sugar in a coffee grinder, set at espresso (fine) to produce the fine castor sugar for the recipe. I make mine in a pie plate covered in parchment paper. The consistency is somewhere between angel food cake and cotton candy. I use fat free cool whip on top with fruit. A beautiful dessert!",

Beat them until foamy soft peaks appear, then very very slowly add the sugar.  Use superfine sugar, or put regular sugar in food processor first.  I like 1/4 cup sugar per egg white.  You can lower oven temp to 250 and bake an hour, then turn off oven and let it sit until you're ready for it.  The parchment paper just peeled right off.  The center will probably fall...it's OK.  Cover with whipped cream.  I don't put sugar in the cream, just vanilla.  The meringue is sweet enough.  Also don't care for canned whipped cream or whipped toppings on this:  too sweet.  It is easier to eat if the fruit is cut up into bite sized pieces.  You can whip the cream in advance and refrigerate.  Just assemble quickly before serving.",
