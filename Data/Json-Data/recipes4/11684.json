I don't know why allrecipes.com changed the measurements when I posted this recipe. Using less of the cola will fix the coloration problem but it still will be enough to give the drink that \"spiked\" quality. Actually you could use diet lemon-lime soda too but I feel the cola adds a little kick. Just be sure that what ever you use the diet soda has a non-aspartame sweetner. Aspartame gives the drink a \"diet\" taste instead of a \"spiked\" taste. -Matt",
