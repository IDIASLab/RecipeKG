First I used the juice out of a can of peas to make this dish worked great and added flavor to my creamed peas secondly I chose to make rue first ( Butter and flour) this worked out great as its the thicken agent in this dish. Lastly I found that instead of 1 1/2 cups water just just 1 cup of juice out of the can and 1 1/2 cups of milk or cream. This is a great dish and one I loved very much.",
