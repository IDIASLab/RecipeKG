I wasn't sure if I would like the cooked brown rice as an ingredient, but it worked wonderfully!  I liked that it did NOT use a sugary, \"ketchupy\" (I know, it's not a real word) or gravy topping. The fried onions make a perfect, tasty topping.  I doubled the recipe and like other reviewers, I used half pork and half beef. I also used a standard muffin tin and formed 12 meatloaf muffins. Terrific recipe! I will come back to this one. Thanks Joyce, for submitting your recipe.",
