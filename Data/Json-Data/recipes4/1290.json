What a delightful combination with the cilantro and the not too overpowering garlic flavour. I found I had to cook the tenderloin on a low to moderate grill because the sugar in the marmalade caramelized too quickly. We accompanied this recipe with fried sesame noodles. The Tenderloin was very delicious!",

I also only made half of the marinade in the recipe and used a large plastic ziploc bag instead of the shallow pan. The meat came out much more flavorful that way. The original amount of the marinade seemed excessive even for 2 lbs of meat. The last thing i did was make a glaze with 2 Tblspns of Orange Marmalade 1 tspn of soy sauce a handufl of chopped cilantro and half a clove of garlic finely minced. I warmed the glaze in the microwave for thirty seconds and poured it over the meat while serving. It came out great will definitely have again.",

I marinated for 3 hrs turning occasionally and then put on the grill. It took alittle longer than 15 mins per side. But was yummy!",

Following the first reviewer's lead we reduced the amount of marmalade but it was still to much. I will change the instructions to mix the marmalade soy sauce and garlic thoroughly prior to placing the meat in it. The zip loc bag idea of one reviewer is a good approach. We also added the glaze option but omitted the garlic from this glace. This mixture also became a good 'sauce' to keep the meat moist. With these adds it is great! My family is already asking for it again!",

Did use the grill pan and had to reduce the heat level because the natural sugars started to burn a little bit. I cut the pork into medallions to stretch it out a bit. I also decided to add just a little bit of grated fresh ginger to the marinade....thought it would work well and it did. I halved the marinade and reduced the second half on the stove to make a thick sauce...to pour on top of white rice and the finished pork. Really good stuff...thanks for the post.",
