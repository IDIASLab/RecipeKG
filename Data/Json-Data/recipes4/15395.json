Great way to get the kids to eat a little spinach they'll never know. It was a hit in this house.",

I didn't add the green grapes because I didn't have one at the time. Instead I added vanilla yogurt to give it the sweetness that the grapes were for. And I had to add a LOT more ice cubes than it called for but I like my smoothies a little icy. I didn't give it the fifth star because although delicious this smoothie is VERY acidic so you can only drink a little bit before it's too much. Will make it again though!",
