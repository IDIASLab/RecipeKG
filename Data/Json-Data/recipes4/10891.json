Eventually though it seemed ready and I used it to pour over my son's cake. It looked fine until I noticed that a lot of it was clear with fine granules of chocolate in it which gave the appearance at first glance of opacity. Ultimately I figured nobody was going to be examining the fondant that closely so I didn't toss out the fondant or my cake. The consistency and pourability was just great. When I tasted it though I felt that there may have been some undissolved granules... I can't be sure though since I used some colored sugars on the cake also. I'm not the most skilled at recipes like this so the shortcomings in my success may be my own fault.",

I cooked the sugar/water/corn syrup mixture over low like it says I stirred it CONSTANTLY until it reached 110 degrees. The second change I made was I melted my chocolate BEFORE I added it to the sugar mixture and I reduced the almond extract to 3/4 tsp. I then stirred the mixture until it cooled slightly to the consistancy I wanted to pour. These changes gave me a smooth and shiny finished product that went over my tiny cakes beautifully. When I use it on things bigger than petits fours I will first give my cakes a crumb coating of buttercream frosting. This gives the fondant a smoother and prettier finish.",
