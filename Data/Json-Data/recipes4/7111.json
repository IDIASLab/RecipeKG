It was enough once in pieces to cover the bottom of the 12 muffin cups I think 1 lb of sausage has to be too much considering I had some leftover batter mix in other site I saw this recipe and noted it was for 24 muffins. It took close to 35 min to bake they were huge but then deflated as normal in this type of egg recipes. The term muffin is a bit misleading as they are nothing like muffins more like souffles. Bottom line delicious! They were a hit at my office and I will make them again. Thank you!",

I halved the recipe as I only has a few eggs and about 10oz of sausage. I used whole milk. My kids loved them. I will definetly make these again. I got 6 muffin cups and I stuffed them with sausage to make them filling. I will make them again. Mine didn't look like the picture they looked like a muffin; they puffed up more but very delicious.",

I did make a fee changes and will continue to tweet this recipe until I really like it. I used almond milk instead of half & half (the extra calories are not needed). I added some onion and garlic powder to the egg mixure. I also stirred in the cheese to the egg mixure rather than placing on top. I might double the Bisquick next time & hope they come out as muffins. I used a mini cupcake pan rather than regular one & it made about 40 little bites. I will do this recipe again just not exactly as written. Good base.",
