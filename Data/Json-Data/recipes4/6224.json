I didn't have any red bell peppers on hand so I just left them out still delicious but I think it would have been even better with the peppers. Other than no peppers I followed the recipe exactly but I did have to cook it a lot longer than 7 to 10 minutes to get the center set. After cooking for 16 minutes on the stove-top the center was still not set even though the edges (and bottom) were nice and brown. I would have turned up the flame but didn't want to burn the bottom so I just transferred the skillet to the oven and broiled it for 3 minutes on the top rack set as close as possible to the heating element and that finished it nicely. Cooled for 5 minutes before slicing to allow the whole thing to firm up a bit. I'm wondering if I didn't get the spinach dry enough or maybe my skillet was smaller than the ones everyone else used making the frittata thicker (a little over an inch thick in the center) in any case it came out great so try finishing under the broiler if yours seems to be taking too long to cook.",

The way a frittata is cooked is what sets it apart from an omelet or other similar dishes. To make a frittata, the eggs are cooked on the stove in a hot skillet, along with the fillings, for a few minutes until the outer edges are set. Then the pan is transferred to the oven where the eggs finish cooking.  I cooked mine on the stove until I saw the edges firm and then transferred it to an oven at 350 degrees for about 5 minutes.  It came out perfect with no burned bottom. Would definitely recommend this to others.",
