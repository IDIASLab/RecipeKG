Once way or the other the pork itself produced so much juice that I was sorry I made the sauce.  Next time, in stead of adding the berries to more wine, I think I will just boil them in the pork's juice.  In the meanwhile, I am going to freeze several pork chops in the juice and sauce I have left over.  It was a big hit- a great \"different\" way to use up all of those summer blackberries.",

I do hate reviewing recipes when I didn't follow it exactly, but I learned in the middle of preparing of this one that my blackberry jam didn't look fresh anymore, so I tossed it.  That said, I substituted a jar of prune-plum jam, and didn't use my fresh blackberries for extra sauce since the jam mixture made quite a bit in the slow cooker.   Slow cooker bags made clean up incredibly easy (can't imagine trying to scrub cooked jam off of the stoneware!).  Thanks for the recipe - I will definitely make this again.",

I am a HUGE fan of wine reductions but wasn't sure if my kids would like it full-on, so I poured the cooking liquid in a saucepan and added about 1/4c red wineong with the blackberries, midway through.  Reduced on med-high.  Added some additional rosemary, black pepper, and ~2T of butter.  Yummy!  I think that I would have preferred the wine reduction more but my 7yo and 3yo seemed to enjoy this lighter version.  Next time I will try the full-on wine reduction sauce in addition to searing the meat first.  Thank you for the great recipe.",

I put my tenderloin in still frozen and after 6 hours on low it was a little overcooked for my taste. \nI made some modifications (sorry) based on what I had on hand and personal preference: reduced the jam  to about 1/2 cup, and honey to 2 tbsp, but left the wine at 2 tbsp and reduced the ground sage to about 1/8 tsp and the rosemary to about 1/2 tsp (personal preference) and added about 1/2 tsp garlic powder. \nBecause there was so much liquid in the crock pot, I didn't bother with the sauce. I blended a couple of tablespoons of flour into about 1/4 cup of water in a small pot, then added the liquid from the crock pot, and brought it to a boil until it thickened. \nMy kids really liked this meal and I will definitely make it again.
