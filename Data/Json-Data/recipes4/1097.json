I was a bit adventurous this time and instead of using more cheese (provolone) on top of the ricotta I used some balsamic vinegar. On my first sandwich I just drizzled some on the tomatoes before putting them in the broiler but it wasn't enough. So on my next sandwich (yes I ate two: ) I poured a SMALL puddle into a shallow plate and put a slice of mulit-grain bread face down. Did the same with the next slice and then proceeded with the recipe. If you are concerned with the bread being soggy put in the broiler on it's own before putting mayo and ricotta on it. I like this recipe as is but with the Balsamic - YUM!",
