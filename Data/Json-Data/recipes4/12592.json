I can't imagine it being too bland - there was enough salt in it between the butter broth Worcestershire and soup mix. I used a can of condensed beef broth - perhaps the others used low sodium or bouillon cubes? Anyway even my kids liked it and my husband said he would definitley like to have this again. It was very easy to prepare and the meat was so tender! This one is a keeper!",

                "reviewBody": "I tried the suggestion posted by others here to cook the dish on high for four hours to avoid mushy rice. Well, mine was still mushy, but not so much as to be unpalatable. I also used a package of flavored white and wild rice. The wild rice was much less mushy, so maybe if I make this again (and I might, as the boyfriend loved it), I'll just use wild rice. Because of the flavoring, I subbed out the beef broth for water.\n\nI also added a ton of herbs from the garden--the ones that worked best in this dish were basil, rosemary, parsley, and sage. I cut up cloves of garlic into quarters and put them on top of the pork chops. They turned out perfectly, and next time I try that trick I'll probably increase the amount of garlic used by 50%. Eating the pork chops with the garlic was about the only thing that made the chops worth eating, though. They were pretty dry, but the thicker pieces fared a little better. Spreading some horseradish on top helped when the garlic ran out.\n\nI also tossed some carrots in the crock pot, and they absorbed a lot of the flavor from the rice.\n\nThis rating gets a three because I had to modify it heavily and it still turned out just okay. It managed to avoid a lower score because it is easy to make and the boyfriend wants me to make it again.",

My hubby says his mom would put the rice underneath the meat so it gets all the juices and IS mushy which they like. Since I added my rice late and on top it wasnt mushy. It was perfect!!!",
