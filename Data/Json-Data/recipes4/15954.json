After making the recipe listed here, I changed a few things to make it even more like I remembered. Started with half pound of bacon, browned the meat in the bacon fat, left out half the butter, added the vegetables, crumbled the bacon. I replaced some of the 5 cups of water with a can of no-added salt diced tomatoes along with the tomato paste, and a big diced russet about 30-40 minuted before serving, 2 t. caraway seed and then a cup of red wine. I did not need to thicken with the cornstarch. I had to add some extra liquid and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because of the potato or because I live at a very high altitude, but make sure you have enough liquid to cook your meat until it\u2019s tender. I used a leaner bison chuck steak and simmered the meat for maybe 2 hours. Beef might take less time. This is just like I remember!!!",

Mix for a minute or so.\n- Add tomato paste and the rest of the broth. Mix for another minute or so.\n- Add beef/veggies, mix, and pressure cook for 35 mins. Natural release. \n- season as needed after.",

I serve this with a nice crusty bread roll or a french baguette ( a good recipe for bread is also on this website.)\n\nI've made this 5 or 6 times now and have made some personal changes although it's still good as is. I like to remove the meat chunks at the end and go at the veggies and soup with a immersion blender to thicken it up. Then add the meat back. I also added a jalepe\u00f1o to give it a kick when adding the bell peppers. I've used beef broth instead of water but I don't think it made much of a difference since beef chuck is fatty to begin with. \n\nThanks so much for sharing this treasure with us!",
