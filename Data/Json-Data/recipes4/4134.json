I slid the butter under the skin per recipe, laid it in the bottom of a big oblong slow cooker. Whisked the soy sauce, 2 T  Real lemon (didn't have a fresh lemon), 1 T. dried minced onion (prefer the less intense onion flavor), salt & pepper and poured it over the chicken. Then laid slin slices of the cream cheese over the chicken, sprinkled with 1 T. dried parsley (didn't have fresh), 1/2 t. dried chives, 1/4. t. dried basil.  Cooked on high for 5-6 hours. Removed chicken (with cheese on top) & kept warm in oven.  Skimmed fat off sauce & thickened with a little corn starch & served on the side.  Absolutely to die for!  When then cream cheese ran out, you could dip in the sauce...moist without either...but the flavor!  It's so tender, all the meat falls off so watch the small bones!",

The first time I made it I used the chicken breasts and I didn't have potatoes so I left them out and we had it with rice and we thought it was outstanding!! I made it again yesterday and used chicken thighs with small baby potatoes and I added a couple of carrots chopped up. I used the zest and juice from the lemon and omitted the salt because of the lemon juice and soy sauce. A complete meal in one pot!! Very rich but very very good!! Will make this again and again. Thanks for the great recipe!!",

I cut the potatoes bit-sized just cus that's how I like them. I add 3 cloves of garlic. I also use a whole 8oz box of sliced mushrooms. I like extra gravy too so I add a cup of homemade chicken broth. I also zest the lemon before I juice it. If using soy sauce omit salt. I have used liquid aminos as a healthier alternative to soy sauce but if I do I use the salt the recipe calls for. Adding cream soup is not necessary and adds much extra sodium; not a healthful idea with the sodium content in the soy sauce. I have made this recipe a few times and with these changes it is a family favorite. With these changes I would give the recipe FIVE stars!!",

I didn't have the small red potatoes so I just quartered the baking potatoes that I already had. I used the 1/3 fat cream cheese and since I didn't have an actual lemon I added about a Tbsp of lemon juice instead. I took the advice of other reviewers and used half the soy sauce. I had to leave out the onion as my kids won't touch them but I used some onion powder instead. Also since I didn't have fresh mushrooms I used a can of drained mushrooms. I was a little concerned at first because the cheese mix was thick. I dolluped (sp?) the cheese over the top and smeared it as best as I could. Then about halfway through I stirred it all together and it looked much more sauce-like. I cooked it on high for about 4 hrs. Delicious!",
