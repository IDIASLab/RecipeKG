I enjoyed this Ginger Salmon as a tasty alternative to grilled Salmon.  This recipe gave the Salmon a sweet, tangy flavor.  I also like the idea of incorporating Ginger into the recipe, since I heard Ginger helps in digestion.  I have seen those gnarled Ginger roots in the grocery store for years, wondering what people ever did with them.  This recipe makes excellent use of Ginger.",
