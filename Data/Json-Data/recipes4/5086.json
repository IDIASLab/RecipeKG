To avoid the thin slices of the fillets being overly flavored in soy I stuck the thinner slices up on the sides of the bowl I used while the thicker sides were in the marinade. Later on I took the thinner sides off from the sides of the bowl and added it to the juice to soak for a few minutes. Thanks.",

I put the fish in the baking dish I was going to use to bake them in, poured the marinade on top and put them in the fridge, in about 30 minutes I rotated and marinated for another 30 minutes. Excellent with wild rice and brussel sprouts!",
