So many ways to change up the recipe. Tex Mex, Asian, etc. Any of your favorite burger recipes will work. To solve the grease problem, simply use the disposable foil cupcake pans. Punch small holes in them so the grease will escape during cooking. The pans can be hung over the edges of a regular baking pan so they are suspended above the base to allow the grease to drip. Lining the base pan with foil will also keep the clean up to a minimum.",

With these changes, the muffins came out excellent.   ",
