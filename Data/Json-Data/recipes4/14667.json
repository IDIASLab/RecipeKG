I cut the sprite and OJ in half very glad that I did because I think it would've been too weak. I didn't mess with the grapes but added gummy worms instead. My only complaint is that the flavor was a little boring (basically tasted like a screwdriver). Next time I plan to use other juices as well (maybe pineapple mango or peach).",

I followed the advice of bebutter because I also thought the amount of OJ sherbert and Sprite was a little too much. Since I had a crowd of people who like to drink at my party I added another liter of Vodka to the punch. I also added a bottle of Pineapple (750ML) and a few dashes of Grenadine for extra taste. It was PERFECT! Everyone raved about the delicious brew. The only unfortunate thing is the gummy worms sank right to the bottom. I used a clear punch bowl so it did look pretty cool at the bottom. By the end of the party people were trying to fish them out of the bowl haha. I highly recommend this recipe and cutting some of the servings in half. If you like a stronger punch add more vodka it's one of those punches where the juices mask the vodka so it WILL NOT taste bad!",
