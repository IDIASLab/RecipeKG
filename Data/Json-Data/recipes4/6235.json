Mayonnaise, dill pickles and red onion \u2013 all set and ready to go!  I did add more chopped pickle, however, since the recipe seemed to want quite a bit of it.  Yes, it was a little dill pickly, so good thing Hubs and I are pickle lovers.  I backed off on the Dijon by a third, and it was just right \u2013 more than that and I think it would have been Dijon overkill.  I added some green peas just because I knew it would be good. Overall, I liked this well enough.  Good, not great.",
