I added some nutmeg to the cheese sauce.  I used Krazy Mixed Up Salt (which is basically a blend of salt, pepper and garlic powder) to sprinkle on the potatoes when layering.  I didn't have pimento so I used finely diced red bell pepper.  The small casserole baked for 30 minutes with the foil then about 10 minutes after removal.  I think that the potatoes were overdone and if I make this again I will not precook the potatoes.  Thanks!",

I actually measured them out in \"cups\" and used 25 in total. I don't think the combination of potatoes added anything to this dish and would use whatever I had on hand. Also I thought there was too much sauce and should have just used both bags of potatoes as now I'm left with about 5-7 potatoes of each. Not sure the pimentos added anything and now I'm stuck with the rest of the jar since the serving was so small. The scallions equal one whole scallion. And now I have the \"rest of the bunch\". Ditto on the spinach. This is a small casserole. If I make it again, I would up all the ingredients.",

Combined with a mixture of mashed red and sweet potatoes, it made a good foundation for the casserole. Final substitution was ham for bacon, still a great flavorful combination.",
