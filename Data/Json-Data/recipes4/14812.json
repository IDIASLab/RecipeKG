I was concerned that some reviewers said that the soup had \"no flavor\" so I went a little heavier on the onions (one medium) and 2 more cloves of garlic as well as adding a  1/4 tsp of black pepper. I did use left over tomato sauce from a jar probably closer to 2 cups, and since I didn't have any beef stock on hand I used Knorr beef bullion for the equivalent of the 32 ounces . I pre- browned my beef  seasoned with garlic pepper and onion powder (only had a a little over a pound) and used 2x's the mushrooms, (baby portabellas). Finally added a 1/4 cup Brandy (instead of wine)  into the mix . The end result was a fabulous rich and flavorful soup. I will definitely make this again .",

Maybe the barley breaking down a bit too much overnight. Very unpleasant. I'd possibly make this again (with changes) but definitely not save any leftovers.  \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: Made this yesterday and my family thought it was ok. If I make it again I'll add some spices or heavily season the beef and then sear first to add more flavor. I would also add celery. I found the recipe as written to be tasty but a bit bland. I'll make it again with subtle changes and see how it goes. It sure made the kitchen smell great!",
