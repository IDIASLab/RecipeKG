I'll admit that I would have preferred my fish fried but then that wouldn't be healthy now would it? The raw fish is wet enough that you really don't need to use the egg. The coating sticks just fine without it. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for the great recipe!",

We had 6 quite large tilapia fillets and 1 egg for dipping was plenty. Instead of a \"seafood\" seasoning used a salt-free grilling seasoning blend (for chicken fish etc.) in the bread crumbs and no powdered garlic. The 1C of bread crumbs was just about enough for 5 fillets so used crushed tortilla chips for the last one. Pan fried the fillets in olive oil until flaky then fried up the asparagus in the same pan with seasoned salt pepper and a little orange peel keeping the fish warm in a warm oven. Easy and incredibly delicious dinner.",
