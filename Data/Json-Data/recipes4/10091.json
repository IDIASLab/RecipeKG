As I followed the instructions in the recipe and I got to the part where one adds the water I realized I would only get about four cups of water into the pot. (I also added a half teaspoon of Basil Marjoram Pepper Oregano and Salt. It seemed way too bland otherwise.) As my wife and sat down to eat she commented that if I had managed to add all eight cups of water it would have tasted as if the water had a very brief passing encounter with a tomato. A few nights later I warmed up the leftovers. Most of the water that had been in the bowl must have been absorbed by the spaghetti so I added an eight ounce can of tomato sauce. I filled the can with water and added that. Then I added about a tablespoon of Basil Marjoram Oregano and Thyme. When I served it up this time my wife said \"now this tastes like something!\" I'm going to assume that the eight cups mentioned in the original recipe was a typo. Some of the ingredients must have been missing. If the recipe was made as stated it would have been more than bland. In fact I think maybe only three cups of water would be sufficient in the original version. I guess with all of these alterations I can name the resulting recipe after myself and call it B.J.'s spaghetti soup but I've got a few more alterations in mind to make it better.;-)",
