We buy any cut of pork when on sale and freeze it, this is a way that we can cook it where it is delicious and (sorta) healthy too. I love this because it is so easy to reheat and eat and the kids will eat every bite. Serve with extra soy sauce.",

I used frozen veggies and subbed a little onion powder for the green onions but I'm sure it would be even better with the green onions I just didn't have any on hand.
