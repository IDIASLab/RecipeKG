This dish is a creamy, wonderful-tasting accompaniment to many dishes, we served it with mashed potatoes and sausages, would go great with turkey at Thanksgiving, I think!  Easy, too!  The only difference was I baked my squash in the oven by cutting it in half and inverting into a pan with a bit of water.  Also I used paprika and parsley for garnish and seasoning.  Wonderful either way!!",
