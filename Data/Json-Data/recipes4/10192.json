Before the prebake I splashed on some worchester sauce. Then I only half cooked the rice cuz I figured it would continue to cook with the chops and we don't like mushy rice........ I then added somemore worchester sauce before adding minced garlic onions and red and green bell peppers and rice. then I topped it all with stewed itialian tomatoes that has the garlic basil and oregon already added and a can of tomato sauce ----instead of the whole canned tomatoes. Then I topped it all with some italian seasoning and a splash of garlic salt. WOW!!!!!!!!! It was da bomb a definite keeper It was very tasty n tender and the rice was great..........",

The key is to top the pork with the onions from the start, and to use something very flavorful like a vidalia... and LOTS of salt and pepper. I also like to put the rice more around the chops so it soaks up the juices and flavors... but be warned, that makes for mushier rice. My mother in law has started putting in under-done rice so that it finishes in the oven with the pork juices. Also great. Either way, this is a good recipe, it just needs tweaking, but if you can get it to work, it's delicious.",

This recipe was perfect as it aloud us to eat chops with out me burning them! It was so easy to make and my husband really enjoyed it. I found the meat a little bland but very enjoyable. I did not have a can of tomatoes so I used a jar of pasta sauce that I had as well as some oregano basil Mrs Dash and Paprika. I also added some garlic to the chops when they were being cooked on their own. My husband said I could make it anytime. The 2nd time I made this I added some Worcestershire sauce and it made all the difference - no bland taste to be found!",
