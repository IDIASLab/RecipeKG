I tried to make it as close to the recipe a possible...but after I'd started making it, I realized that I was out of regular dijon mustard. I used honey mustard instead...and it tasted great. I also forgot to thaw my chicken breasts ahead of time...and I put this together at about 11:30 last night. I just put the frozen breasts in the greased pan and poured the marinade over. I covered it with foil and put it in the fridge overnight. It made a great lunch for us...after church, I pulled the pan out of the fridge and just popped it in the oven. I did find that it took a lot longer to bake...more like an hour. But we have problems with our oven over/under heating, so that might have been the case. The finished chicken was extremely juicy, tender, and the flavors of honey, mustard, and curry came through very well, harmonizing nicely without anything being overpowering. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it's a keeper!",

I was afraid of the honey or mustard being too central to the flavor but neither was \"too much.\" Perhaps the soy covered that a bit. Unlike some of the reviews I do like curry as long as it's not ridiculously strong but I really couldn't even taste it. (There was a hint of it in the leftovers heated up.) It's a bit of an odd blend of ingredients but nothing seemed to predominate at all - so there was nothing about it that really \"made it\" for me. It's very easy and I give extra credit for that; however it's not a \"last-minute\" kind of easy for when I just want something easy and quick because of the marinating time.",
