I added garlic and lime juice to the avocado to make it more guac-like but it was still really bland. I've now read reviews where the cooks added a lot of seasoning to the beans and they're right the beans need it. These were also pretty difficult to pick up and eat. 30 seconds into dinner I had a mess of fallen out black beans around me. I had to fold them kind of burrito style to eat. Hard taco shells would be much easier. I may try this again with more seasoning and some other modifications since I do like easy meatless meals but I would not make again as is.",

I think the one thing this recipe is missing is lime juice - I squeezed fresh lime juice into the salsa and the avocado mixture. The citrus really brightens the flavors and gives it the pop it needs.
