Instead of the ham bone, I used a ham hock and used up some left over ham cubes I had in the freezer. I also lightly sauteed the onions with some garlic in a little bit of EVOO before adding the Ham Hock. I also did half chicken stock and half water... sure makes a differance in flavor. I also find 2 cups of dried peas, instead of 2 1/2 is more than enough as this soup tends to end up a tad too thick. ",

I did boil the ham hock in chicken broth instead of water for 1 hour ahead of time.  Then I added the split peas  and pepper (I omitted the salt).  I added about 2 cups of diced carrots, 2 cups of celery and 2 cups of potatoes.  I added 2 garlic cloves, some parsley flakes, thyme, onion powder (since I left the onions out), 2 bay leaves and the taste was amazing!  I was going to blend the split peas before I added the other stuff, but they lost form and made the soup a lot thicker.  I hope I can replicate this soup, it was off the hook! ",

I threw all the ingredients into a crock pot, didn't rinse the peas and threw the ham bone in with all the meat on. I cooked it on high for several hours. I probably added more liquid than the recipe called for but then I just threw in a whole bag of dried split peas..so thought I would need more liquid. THe soup was REALLY thick, and so I add more chicken broth to every serving. I also used Thyme instead of marjoram as i didn't have that in the cupboard. I will definately use this recipe everytime I have a ham bone.",

Cooked on high for 8 hours. Removed ham bone and bay leaves, and cook uncovered for last hour on low. So good!

I didn't and it foamed up and I lost alot of the onions when I skimmed. Also normally I would sautee the veg before adding stock.  I added garlic and cayenne pepper to kick it up a notch. Also, add more water or stock. This recipe makes it way too thick.",
