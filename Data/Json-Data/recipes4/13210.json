I added just a few grates of orange zest since I used a fresh orange for the juice and I think I might have reduced the turmeric slightly as I wasn't so sure it was for me so I'd say I used 1/8 tsp. I can detect it but it's not overpowering at all so that was a good decision for my tastebuds! I also added the orange juice before microwaving (didn't read through recipe entirely before starting) but it was fine - I ended up cooking for more like 3 1/2 minutes. I like the flavors but I did need to add a little drizzle of honey for sweetness. Makes one nice big serving or two smaller ones if you're serving a little extra fruit or yogurt for breakfast. Thanks for sharing Leah!",
