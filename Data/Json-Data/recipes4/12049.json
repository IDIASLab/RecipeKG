The second time I made it I omitted the pineapple as I thought it gave good flavor but an odd texture. I used the same recipe again but instead of orange jello and mandarine oranges I substituted strawberry jello and frozen strawberries and it was delicious. I did not have any problems with either one of them setting up properly. I did stir them once while they were setting up as the fruit sunk to the bottom a bit at first. Love it!",

This is really sweet so be prepared for that. I used fruit in its own juice but put in some marshmallows which might have made it sweeter. You can't tell there's tapioca in here so don't let that scare you away. The marshmallows gave it a little texture which we all liked and I'd consider adding some chopped walnuts or pecans if you like nuts. Anyway it was really good and it'd be easy to sit and eat a bowl of it! I just made this for the 3rd time (for Easter) and couldn't find instant Tapioca anywhere so used the Jello cook and serve and it was just as good. If I hadn't added the marshmallows (about 2-3 cups)it might've been too runny but w/marshmallows it was perfect. As for the reviewer that said hers was too runny I wonder if she forgot to drain her fruit? That extra fruit juice would definitely make it too runny!",

I can't find the America Instant Tapioca that it called for anymore, but the jello cook and serve tapioca works just as well. The best part is that you don't have to use the same jello and fruit flavors. One of my favorites is peach jello with peaches and blueberrys. I recently tried the new mango jello flavor and added crushed pineapple, small chunks of mango, coconut and macadamia nuts. It was a big hit at an office party. This is not relegated to salad staus either. One of my favorite things to do is to make it the night before when I have company. Then leave it out as a topping for waffles as a self serve breakfast. The combinations are endless. I have done strawberry and banana, strawberry and raspberry, black cherry and banana, etc. To enhance the flavor if you want you can use the fruit juice instead of water. Just add water to make up the volume if there is not enough fruit juice. And don't ever use fresh pineapple as the jello will not set up, it tastes fine its just sort of runny like pudding.  I obviously learned this lesson the hard way.",
