The ones who rated this so low were obviously looking for a different type of dumpling (they need to try good old Jiffy, the recipe is right on the back of the box).  I am a mommy so I don't like to spend all day in the kitchen so this is what I do:  I buy a cooked rotisserie chicken, get all the meat off and put it in the pot along with all drippings from the container, and 2- 32 oz. containers of chicken broth (8 cups total) plus 4 cups of water with 4 tsp. of chicken boullion granules.  This makes 12 cups.  Then add the poultry seasoning, seasoned salt, and pepper.  Boil and add dumplings.  When the dumplings are about done, thicken with about 1 cup of flour mixed with 3/4 - 1 cup of cold water if you like it thicker (like me)!  This recipe is very quick, as long as you have your dumpling dough prepared ahead of time and ready to go!  It's a 30 minute meal from start to finish!  I don't even use the veggies cooked in margarine and it tastes wonderful, it doesn't need any additional seasoning and it's nice to have it without the bones in it.  The dumplings are so tender!  ENJOY!!!",

I used 1 extra teaspoon of shortening in the dumplings and sage as suggested by another member. They were actually better the second day than they were the first. Oh and I did thicken the broth with flour to broth and return to the stock. Was just wonderful! Happy cooking! =)",

Also I simmered the dumplings for about 30-40 min until they were tender.....adding just a sprinkling of flour to thicken. The whole family loved it! This is my ONLY chicken and dumpling receipe now.

After visiting my boyfriend's family in AR and having his grandma's chicken n' dumplings, this was the one recipe I've seen that seemed like his grandmas. I made it for him and he loved it! He said it's the closest thing to his grandma's he's ever had and that it was eve nbetter then his mom's or his dad's chicken n' dumplings.   I would say to those who didn't like it, that there are 2 keys to it's success. 1)Before adding the dumplings back in, taste the broth and season it to your liking. 2) After cutting the dumplings but before throwing them in, make sure they are well coated in loose flour. Toss the dumpling strips in four and shake it off as you add them in. That's how you get the smooth thick broth.",

I have been looking for a recipe for rolled dumplings for years and this dough is PERFECT for rolling out! I did make a few changes. I added coarse ground pepper and parsley flakes to the dumpling dough 'cause I like them like that. I also sliced potatoes super thin and added them the last 30 minutes before I added the dumplings. I also tossed in some baby carrots and green beans the last 30 minutes as well. Even my Midwest husband enjoyed this recipe and the leftovers the next day are INCREDIBLE!
