I forgot to pick up mascarpone (but will in the future) so I used sour cream. Because this is something I would like to have more often than holidays I cut the butter by more than half and still thought it had a nice rich flavor. We both enjoyed the light fluffy texture and I enjoyed being able to make it earlier in the day. Thanks Chef John.",

Used Yukon Gold potatoes (because had them already) and only used one stick of butter (instead of two) based on the other reviews. The dish far exceeded the effort and everyone loved it. I made this the night before up until the point of cooking it - and just set it out about an hour before putting into the oven. I cooked it a total of 25 minutes (just because I got busy) and the extra time was fine. I used my convection oven and had planned to use the broiler to get the peaks to brown but they browned on their own without the broiler. I didn't have an extra 9x11 dish so I used a Pyrex oblong glass dish that is approx. 8x11x2.5 and it worked perfect. This will be a go-to side for many occasions and potlucks to come!",

I followed the recipe exactly  but noted several problems with the recipe as posted: (1) it does not list specific amounts of salt & pepper. I added 1 tsp of each to the mascarpone/egg yolk/milk mixture, then salt to taste AFTER combining the mascarpone mixture with the potatoes and butter. The potatoes were perfectly seasoned as a result. (2) The recipe calls for seasonings (salt, pepper) twice - once when mixing the mascarpone/egg yolk/milk, and again when combining this mixture with the potatoes and butter. I wonder if the second addition of seasonings is a mistake - except for salt to taste. I accidentally used 8 oz. (1 cup) of mascarpone instead of 1/2 cup, and the potatoes turned out fine. I also used a hand mixer to whip the potatoes rather than whisking by hand (I'm not a fan of lumpy potatoes.) Be sure to view Chef John's video on making the potatoes and use 4-1/2 lb. of large russets as he suggests. Thanks for a great recipe! - it's easy to make and delicious.",
