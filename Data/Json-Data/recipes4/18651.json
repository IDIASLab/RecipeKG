It was a great success, everyone who ate a slice kept coming back for seconds! The cake is best served chilled, so you may want to put it in the fridge or freezer for at least 30 minutes before serving (I like mine overnight).",

I don't know that it actually did anything for the cake considering a box mix is already sweet. The pears stuck to the bottom of the pan so I ended up losing part of them. I also after cooking the pear filling I tasted the pear mixture before putting it in the cake and we did not care for it so I left it out. I did think the frosting had good flavor. It was very light and not overly sweet. It was soft because it is a whipped cream frosting so as the recipe author states it is better after refrigerating.",
