The only thing I would advise if doing in slow cooker is cut back on the water a little bit. I liked how it came out but was informed that while the taste was right on it was a little soupy for how the dish is supposed to be. The flavours were wonderful. I had to buy a few of the spices since I have never made indian quisine before and have never used them. Definately worth the small investment.",

If you're a fan of spicy foods I would add more red pepper flak and cayenne than what this recipe calls for. For true spicy fans this curry is a little too mild as is. I substituted chicken stock for the water double the yams and used about half the amount of potatoes. I also used canned diced carrots to save time and energy. This is a fabulous recipe that also freezes well. I highly recommend it.",

Also I added a can of coconut milk. That was a great improvement. I also added vegetarian chicken to it. Mealstarters found at most any big chain grocery store in the freezer section.
