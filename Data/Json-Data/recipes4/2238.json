These were better than I've had in a restaurant, and my boyfriend said they were the best he's had in his whole life.  I used more garlic and shallot than called for and it turned out great.  A tip to keep your artichokes under water while boiling is to invert a steamer on top of them.  Serve as well with mayonaise and fresh lemon wedges for a variety.  Oh, and by the way, a great way to remove the choke is to use a grapefruit spoon (if you have it)- it's easy to get it out whole that way!  Hope this helps!",

They enjoyed the Texas mesquite smoke flavor from our grill. (We use only wood not gas) I added half an onion to the boiling water and 1/2 stick real butter with a squirt of lemon and sea salt. I trimmed the sides and top and it had a great presentation as well. I served with lemon cilantro butter and cilantro mayo but they enjoyed then as they were. I will definatley do this again when entertaining. Thanks for the great recipe.",
