But, O M G, Wow!\" I knew going into this recipe, that no, I wasn't making a pizza-pizza, but the one major change that I did (b/c yikes, that was loads of cheese on the ingredients' list and I didn't want the base to be quiche-like!) was to drop the cheese from the zucchini part, save the parmesan, and sub 1/2 c. italian-seasoned breadcrumbs. Smooshing the zucchini mixture into a pie plate, across the bottom and up the sides, yielded a pie-ish crust that tasted so good! I followed the meat filling exactly, w/ the exception of adding garlic, and letting it simmer for about an hour before spreading it over the zucchini layer. Topped w/ mozzarella, monterey jack, mushrooms and olives and baked again resulted in an unusual, unique pie/pizza/casserole that we absolutely loved. I know that the taste remained, for the most part, what the recipe author intended, but I just felt that swapping cheese for breadcrumbs in the \"crust\" would hold up better to the meat sauce that was going on top. This was a great way to use up zucchinis (don't forget to drain and press out the moisture really well!), and even better, you can swap out any toppings as you would on a regular pizza. Thanks for a fun, delicious idea Christina!",

I followed the directions pretty much to the letter, except I put all the mozzarella cheese in the crust because I read it wrong.  I added another egg to help it stick together, however, and it turned out great.  I think the third egg really helped solidify the crust.  It doesn't eat like a pizza, but I didn't expect it to, either.  I would love to use this crust on other savory pies...I'm already thinking using it with a tomato pie.  Great recipe, since you can totally use what you have on hand to make it work.  I'm guessing the leftovers are going to be even better, so now I have something to look forward to at work tomorrow.
