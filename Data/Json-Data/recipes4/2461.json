I was going to chop the hot dogs up and use hamburger buns but then I found some hot dog buns in the freezer... so I ended up only chopping up two weiners and the other six were left whole. I added a can of diced tomatoes and some Italian seasoning to the sauce because it NEEDED more liquid to cook the hot dogs. I also added some diced onion and maybe 3 oz of diced kielbasa sausage simply to use it up. It was really good! With the extra tomatoes it made meals for two days and we used up both packages of buns - very little sauce hot dog and some cheese on the hot dog buns and sloppy joe mix on the hamburger buns! Our two-year old liked the hot dogs and picked out the hamburger. Thanks Moonpie for surprising me!",
