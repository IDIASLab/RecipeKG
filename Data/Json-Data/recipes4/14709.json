I omitted the celery salt (didn't have any on hand) and subbed in yellow and red bell peppers for the green and ground beef for the turkey. I also added a chopped tomato just to use up some produce.

The only thing I changed was using about an 1\" long piece of minced celery that I added to the meat when cooking the onion pepper and garlic and that was because I could not find dried celery flakes at the store. Topped my bowl off with a couple dashes of Tobasco sauce and had a filling and delicious lunch. Used a Cajun seasoning mix off of this site (Cajun Spice Mix by Bobbie Jean) and know I'll make this again. Very adaptable recipe too! I can see using turkey sausage or adding diced tomato and/or beans. Great side dish or light meal. Thanks akatenacious3.",
