If you have a tomato allergy, this recipe is life changing :)\nTo me, it just tastes like a low-acid tomato sauce.  My husband complained loudly about how he'll hate the sauce because he can't stand beets.  But after he tried it, he's been more than willing to go for seconds.  He admits that you can't taste the beets.\nMy only suggestion is adding a few tablespoons of chicken broth and plenty of oregano and basil.  The sauce takes on the seasonings very well.\nTHANK YOU!!",

I didn't have a bay leaf, so I added a little more Italian Seasoning, tweaked my seasonings (a pinch of sugar, a dash of hot sauce, & a splash of Sweet Chili sauce)...it made quite a bit (enough so that turned around & used the leftovers & made spaghetti for the next nite!) I will most DEFINITELY be tweaking the Italian Seasonings & using my favorite Mexican seasonings (chili powder, cumin, & Adobe) to make some homemade chili within the next few weeks!
