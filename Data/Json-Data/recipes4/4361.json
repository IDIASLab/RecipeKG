The first time I mixed it with Greek yogurt, low-fat milk, and light mayo. The second time I mixed it with full fat sour cream, low-fat milk, and light mayo. I liked the yogurt version the best.

I thought (as did my family) it was terrible.  First off it's way too much onion.  And it was missing something,  I am not sure what yet.  It's not smooth as you would expect ranch to be.  I pulsed it in my food processor many times and the minced onion doesn't break down enough.  The chunkiness is a personal preference, but it's still way too much onion.  The only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead on the original one I had, is that I am willing to try it again and put in less onion and play around with the other ingredients to see if I can make it better.  Otherwise, I just wasted money buying the buttermilk powder.",
