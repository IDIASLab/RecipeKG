There is more garlic than Tuscans are accustomed to using (that's an american tendency), but if you like it, fine.  Be sure to buy sausage that isn't already full of garlic.  Only other thing....add the red wine to deglaze the skillet after having drained off the fat from the sausage and having put it aside for a moment.  THEN, add the onions, garlic, and squash, and seasonings, and sweat them tender before putting the sausage back into the skillet and adding the broth and spinacini leaves (that's what they're called, here).  Details, but will make for flavors that are more distinct with no added work.  Good recipe!!  Buon appetito!",

I added a little diced celery and carrots along with the onion and can't bring myself to use canned chicken broth when it's so easy to make and freeze.. for times like this.. but those were the only changes. This would be great for company with some fresh bread ripped not sliced for sopping the final drips at the bottom of the bowl. Great soup on a cold night! Thanks for the recipe DG more offerings like this and you'll be one of my AR favorites!",

I added celery and carrots to the mix when I saut\u00e9ed the sausage onion and garlic and omitted the squash simply b/c I do not like it in soup. I also added some crushed red pepper (approx. tsp or to taste). Yum! I suggest letting the soup simmer longer than 15 minutes in about 45 55 minutes it tasted a whole lot better. Just add the spinach about 15 minutes before finishing as the recipe states. Then break out some good crusty bread and dive in! The leftovers are just as good if not better.
