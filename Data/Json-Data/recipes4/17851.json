Next time, I will shred it myself because the \"anti-clumping powder\" that they use on pre-shredded cheese always leaves a little grittiness in the final dish.  It was subtle though.  7 minutes worked like a charm on my instant pot.  Oh yeah, I decreased the water by 1 cup since so many said theirs turned out runny, and mine was perfect!  I served this for a playdate, and all of the kids devoured it.  No one complained that it wasn't \"Kraft\" ;)",

I didn't have mild cheddar and instead of using all sharp...I had some Velveeta. Mine didn't turn out soupy at all....probably because I fell asleep and the pressure went down on it's own. I actually had to add some milk.  Will make it again for sure.",

                "reviewBody": "Ok. So this was my first time with the pressure cooker. Next time I'm gonna make some changes. I followed the recipe almost exactly with some small exceptions... per other reviews I used a little less water- 1 2/3. I cut down on cooking time since I prefer my pasta al dente. I also added some paprika and cayenne. I subbed yellow mustard for mustard powder. I also shredded the cheddar myself. It did come out a bit soupy but it thickened once it cooled. I thought the sauce was gritty and bland. Despite cutting down cook time I thought the pasta was overcooked. I had no issues with scorching though. I served it with steamed broccoli and peas. That said next time I will add the cheddar after cooking. Between the heat and liquid I think it will mix well. Cheddar isn't really meant to have water injected into it you know? I think I'll also do the full 8 oz of cream cheese next time too. I think with some tweaks this would be a great quick easy recipe for a family or a couple to have leftovers for the week. Thank you!",
