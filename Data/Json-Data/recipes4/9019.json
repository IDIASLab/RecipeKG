I have read many biscuits recipes in this site and searching the web and still couldn't find one that would make a decent biscuit. I decided to not give up and keep trying on the search of the correct biscuit recipe. Well finally I discovered what the problem was. If you read this recipe it doesn't call for the ingredient that will make it happen. EGGS!!!!!!!!!!! You need to put an egg into your mixture. Without the egg this will turn into a bad biscuit. Egg will bring the cohesiveness of a real biscuit. Try it and you will be see you will be much happier.",
