I baked in small ramekins, ended up with three, but it baked up just a bit on the dry side.  If I make this again, I\u2019ll probably add some chicken broth in addition to some additional spices.  There\u2019s enough sharpness from the cheese, and although we all have different taste preferences,  I found the overall flavor overall just a little one note (marjoram).   This is a new recipe, and I don\u2019t want to discourage others from trying, but for me, it\u2019ll need a little tweaking.",
