The flavor was REALLY good. Even my husband who doesn't like beans that much loved this recipe!!!   The only changes I made were the following:  * I cooked the beans for about 35 minutes instead of 20.  * I used 1/4 cup of olive oil instead of 1 cup  * I used 1 28-Ounce can of Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted Crushed Tomato, and 4 garlic cloves instead of 2 (because I love garlic)   THIS was sooooooooo YUMMY!!!!! I will be making this very often, even for parties!!! Thanks for posting!!",

I added a chicken boullion cube to the water when I was simmering the beans to give them a little more flavor, and I only added about 1/3 cup olive oil to reduce the fat.  I used about 1 Tbsp fresh parsely instead of the dill.  I baked them uncovered for 1 hr 30 min at 375, and did not need to add any extra liquid.  I sprinkled feta cheese on top when I took them out of the oven.  Everyone thought these were a good alternative to baked beans at the picnic I took them to.  I like the recipe because it's really easy and does not involve much prep work.",
