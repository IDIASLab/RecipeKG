I'll make again; however, I would make changes.\" I followed the recipe exactly, only I used a little less ground beef, and added a heavy sprinkle of \"Taco Seasoning I\" from AR. It came out a little watery and difficult to serve, and the tortillas in the middle were kinda a slippery afterthought. I plan on making this again, b/c the taste was spot-on, but I would combine the soup/Rotel w/ the beef and beans, and eliminate the tortillas, and instead, just serve it w/ crushed tortilla chips on top. Also making this extremely tasty was garnishing it w/ chopped lettuce, cilantro, and a blob of sour cream.",

The only two changes that I made were that I substituted one package of taco seasoning mix for the chili powder (I still added the ground cumin) and then I also crumbled up leftover hard taco shells and sprinkled them right underneath the cheese. This gave the dish a nice texture. The flavor was wonderful and we will certainly eat this dish on a regular basis! Thanks!",

Why do so many recipes that call for browning ground beef with onion and or garlic say to drain excess fat afterwards? You're draining away some of the flavor of the onion and garlic! I brown my ground beef alone and drain any excess fat remove the ground beef and using the same pan brown my onions and garlic. Too this recipe I used tomatoes with habenero instead of green chilies 2 cloves of garlic grated on a rasp 1 can of black olives very coarsely chopped and a can of whole kernel corn drained. As the entree it actually made 6 servings.",
