Since I did have a tub of soft cream cheese I used that - very good & rich. I added a 8 oz box of sliced mushrooms. I had a 14 oz can of tomato sauce with mushrooms but added the whole can instead of saving half so in the final step I added a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes after draining off some of the liquid. My husband took a bite and said that it was Very Good even before I had a chance to ask if he liked it!! Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!",
