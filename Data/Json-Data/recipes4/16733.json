My aunt stole a huge chunk of it for a post-Christmas meal with other relatives today, my parents took some home, and even my uncle, who hates coconut, liked it (though, I didn't tell him it was in there ;D )\n\nI did use Carrot Cake III from this site instead of a boxed cake mix, and made real whipped cream instead of using Cool Whip. I was a little short on filling, but I'm assuming that's due to the whipped cream change. Next time I'll whip a full 16oz of it and that should do it. I did have a little trouble getting the cream cheese mixed into the pudding smoothly, in the end it was still a little lumpy, but the toppings masked that at least! I let it soften a bit first, but maybe it needed a little more time. I might try a cooked pudding next time and see if the heat makes it easier to blend the cheese in. There will definitely be a next time though, this is completely delicious.",
