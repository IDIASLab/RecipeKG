They are descendants of the Portuguese invaders who married locals during their reign in Malaysia. This recipe uses candlenuts and galangal; candlenuts are hard tropical nuts used in Southeast Asian cooking and available in Indian or Asian markets. Galangal is a rhizome similar to ginger with a hot, ginger-peppery flavor, used primarily as a seasoning. It is also available in Asian markets.",

A local Chinese supermarket offered both chopped preserved in a jar and fresh ones. I opted for fresh. I was less lucky with the candlenuts so I substituted Brazil Nuts as suggested by an ingredients substitution website. Finally I used fresh birds eye green chile having watching something similar being prepared while in Asia. The volume of ingredients to blend was a major effort and my poor blender was in melt down failing to make anything like a paste. Fresh Galangal is quite hard and with the nuts it is just too much. I aborted and removed and grated the Galangal and nuts by hand then back for a finish off blend. Also the quantity of Ginger and Galangal are not listed in the ingredients I used a couple of bulbs of each. I think if you like it then just add more. Beyond that it was really simple. Cooling times and liquid exactly as expected and results good",

Allspice is not mentioned in the commontary but galangal is so maybe the ingredient list is supposed to read 1 tsp galangal? And how much shrimp paste to use? I used about 1 Tbsp but I think it could have used more. The dried chilies are spicy! I used only about 15 and that was quite good enough for me!",
