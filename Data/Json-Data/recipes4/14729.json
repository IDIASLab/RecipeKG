Oh I can just imagine how the goat cheese would enrich this dish with a creamy texture.  The drizzle of soy sauce just topped off wonderfully melded flavors.  You must try this!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was extremely yummy! Very hearty & tasty while not weighing you down after eating it. Loved all the elements together. I only have two critiques. First I halved this recipe since the number being served was only two people and 10 servings seemed a bit silly and when I did so I noted that there didn't seem to be nearly enough liquid for the amount of vegetables in this dish. It's hard to imagine how it would be different if I'd doubled everything. Fortunately I was able to simply add more coconut milk & water to bring the ratio to a reasonable amount (and to compensate I added more spices halved yet again). This seemed to rescue the dish quite well. So at a minimum if you're halving the recipe be cautious and keep the ingredients on hand. Secondly the name; you've got to change the name. \"Allergy Friendly Comfort Soup\" does NOT sound tasty. I wouldn't even tell my wife what the recipe was called because I was sure she'd ask me for something else. All that said this recipe is super delish and will definitely go into our recipe box!!",

The reason for 4 stars because following the cooking times will make it seriously overcooked (but some people like it like that) also you don't need salt if you use chicken stock or some chicken bouillon. I used broccoli instead of cauliflowers for added color. Broccoli requires no cooking just stir it in the food when ready wait 5 min. and it is ready)",
