My friends and my husband LOVED this salad and finished every bite... passing the bowl back and forth until it was gone. They raved about it. This recipe is a winner. I switched things up a little. Instead of using just quinoa, I had on hand 'Sun Harvest Organic Super Grains'...a blend of white quinoa, red quinoa, millet and buck wheat and also added salt and pepper. This recipe calls for no seasoning so I felt it needed some a little salt and pepper to taste. I also used 2 avocados because why would you use 1 1/2 avocados?  I also added more pomegranate seeds because why would you use 1/2 a pom? Since I have a pom bush, I think I actually used about 2 poms ( I keep pom seeds in my fridge during this season so I'm not sure how much I added.",
