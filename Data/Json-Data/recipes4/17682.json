I followed the recipe as written but needed 3 times the amount of cinnamon and tumeric to coat the beef the recipe called for - no problem! I did find it required longer to simmer before the sauce was thickened and the meat tender. I think in future I'll start the process earlier in the day and braise in the oven at 325\u00b0 for 2-3 hours.  I must admit I made regular basmati rice which was perfect with this dish. Thanks Sarah for a great recipe I'll return to often and will also serve to guests.",
