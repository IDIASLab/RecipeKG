I doubled the amount of italian sausage and used all red pepper (we don't care for green pepper at all). I also added a mess of fresh garlic and a half pound of chopped baby bella mushrooms. I didn't want to water down my sauce so I did not add the water. I used a homemade marinara sauce instead of jarred which means my sauce had more spices than the sauce called for than the recipe. This was pretty easy to assemble the directions were pretty straightforward. This was pretty tasty--my two boys really liked this one had two servings! I didn't serve this with the Pepperidge Farm garlic texas toast--my son and I made the Garlic Bread Fantastique which is also from this site. Along with a small tossed salad this was a filling and satisfying meal. All three of the guys asked me to make this again instead of Pioneer Woman's Lasagna which is HUGE because her lasagna has been MY lasagna for almost five years now. The cream cheese layer was CRAZY good. I would have never thought that it would have been. The only reason that it's not five stars is because it just needs a little more spice and a homemade sauce with more spices.",

This was actually my first time ever making Lasagna too. & this Lasagna was DELICIOUS and that's saying something since I do not like lasagna. My boyfriend said this was the best Lasagna that he'd ever had and that's saying something because Lasagna is his most favorite meal. I made some minor adjustments. I used HOT Italian sausage since my boyfriend and I like some kick with our food. I listened to a couple previous reviewers and I added an extra brick of cream cheese as well as I diced up a whole onion. For the spaghetti sauce I used Hunts Thick N Chunky Roasted Garlic (this is what I use as a base for my homemade spaghetti sauce) and I added some Italian seasoning and some finely chopped mushrooms (I finely chopped the peppers too since I didn't want chunky veggies taking away from the flavors in this dish). I used the \"No boil\" lasagna noodles so I added a bit of extra water to my sauce after some words of caution from my mother. After all that I found that I didn't have quite enough cream cheese mixture and not enough sauce. I opened a second can of Hunts and added it to the left over sausage mixture for the top layer. I also ran out of noodles. I think I needed to use a smaller dish but then there probably wouldn't have been deep enough. I served this dish with a garden salad as per my boyfriends request and some garlic toast. This recipe will be one that is used often in our house. Thanks for sharing this! YUM!",

The cream cheese makes it so creamy and gives it a nice gooey consistency and overall it's a hearty and just plain delicious recipe. My fiancee and I have made it our \"special occasion\" dish because we love it so much. The only difference I make is adding a whole red pepper instead of half a cup of each because I'm not a fan of green peppers.
