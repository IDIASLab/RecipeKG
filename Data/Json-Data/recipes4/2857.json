It is by far the best I've ever eaten and so easy to make. I did use the conversion to 2% milk because it's all I had in the house (7/8 cup milk plus 1 tablespoon butter). It still came out rich and thick. I left out the cayenne because i don't like the heat and added instead somewhere between 1/4-1/2 tsp of nutmeg, which all true alfredo sauce recipes call fo,r and that put it OVER THE TOP!! I confess I also added a little extra grated and schredded cheese because let's face it, you can never have too much cheese! The more I added, the better it tasted. I have also tried this sauce with chicken and broccoli instead of crab which was also very good. I will use this as a base for any recipe calling for an alfredo sauce in the future. My search is over!! THANKS AGAIN!!!!!",

If you've ever had Red Lobster's Crab Alfredo, you won't feel the need to go spend that money anymore, because you can do it yourself at home for cheaper and it tastes the same if not better. This is the first Alfredo sauce that I have ever made, it was quick, simple, easy and called for stuff that I already had, so I didn't even have to leave my house. I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I changed one thing in this recipe after reading the reviews; instead of using 2 cups of half & half, I used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of half& half!!! ",

The half and half is not what is causing the excessive thickness but you can use regular (or even 2%) milk and it won't cut down on the richness too much. 1/2 tsp. of cayenne is way too much unless you like your food Indian HOT. Use just a pinch and taste the mixture. Alternatives that give a flavor boost would be a little nutmeg as in a classic bechamel or about 1/2 tsp. of Coleman's dry mustard as in classic Crab Imperial sauce. Depends on what you like. I also reduced the cream cheese to 3 oz. because the gums in the cream cheese add to the excessive thickness. You can thin with a little more milk or water if it is still thicker than you like but careful not to make it too thin.",
