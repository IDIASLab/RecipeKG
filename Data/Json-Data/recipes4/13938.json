You can easily shape it into any animal you like, as this dough lends itself well to handling and doesn't rise uncontrollably and distort your animal's shape. Make the dough in your bread machine, then shape it, let it rise, brush it with egg wash, and bake. To make other shapes, coloring book animals enlarged and placed underneath parchment paper make great guides!",

As an amateur bread-maker I found the assembly directions were easy to follow and the bread tasted great. I made this in my KA and added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and a tsp or so of the Creole Seasoning Blend from this site (to marry the flavors of the meal). This bread made a great centerpiece for our table... while it lasted! I can't wait to try it with other animal shapes.",

Next time I will try to get my dough a bit stickier I think. The parts didn't quite grow together and the eyes fell off but I think with practice it will turn out better. I just stuck it together with toothpicks and it looked fine.:) I've never even made a regular Italian bread before so I'm happy to have this recipe for a simple loaf.",
