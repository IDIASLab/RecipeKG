Since my Labrador needs no additional reason to be happy I also left out the honey. Out of the 2 dog biscuit recipes I have he prefers this one, it's more peanutty. (I know I tried a bite). It only made 14 biscuits with a medium-size round biscuit cutter, so next time I will at least double the recipe. As for the cook - don't be stingy with the flour when rolling it out. thank you!",

I used flaxseed meal (had on hand) instead of wheat germ assuming it has the same healthful benefits for dogs as it does for peops.  I took the suggestion from another reviewer and pressed the cookies with a fork rather than rolling and cutting them out.  I also doubled the recipe.  (Our dogs get rewarded alot!)  Dough a bit sticky and would have required additional flour for rolling/cutting.  Otherwise, fantastic recipe!  I love knowing what's really gowing in my dogs tummies!
