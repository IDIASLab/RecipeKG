Indeed, I agree with his assessment \u2013 that they were NOT soggy as some can be, they were flavorful, as some are not, and certainly a \u201cmake again.\u201d  But what he didn\u2019t know was that I changed this recipe significantly, not with the ingredients, but with the measurements of them.  I used TWICE the amount of potatoes called for while at the same time using only 1/3 the amount of flour.  If my math is correct that means I used only 1/6 the amount of flour meant for a given measurement of potatoes.  I used no butter at all \u2013the bacon grease was enough.  As Hubs put it, the potato cakes didn\u2019t suffer for my changes, and in his mind (and mine too) they were instead improved.  As written, with the hefty amount of cheese and flour expected for the amount of potatoes called for, I can\u2019t imagine I would have liked them.  Too much flour, cheese and butter for sure, for such a small amount of potatoes.  So\u2026 use twice the amount of potatoes, no butter, and just a tablespoon or two of flour and these are simply excellent.  As this recipe\u2019s first reviewer, I want to be very careful that I send it off on the right foot. My four star rating, then, is better than the recipe as written and less than the five stars this recipe deserves with these modifications.  To rate it any less than four stars would unnecessarily dissuade others from trying this recipe that has such great potential.",

                "reviewBody": "I used all of the ingredients in this recipe, but adjusted the quantities.  At least in this house, there's no way that 1-1/4 cups of mashed potatoes will yield 4 servings as a side dish, so I used what I had in the fridge, 2 cups.  Also, even with 2 cups of potatoes, 3/4 cup flour is too much.  I didn't want to be tasting the flour in my potato cakes, so that was adjusted downward.  And I didn't use nearly the fat listed in this recipe.  After cooking the bacon, there was a lot of grease in the skillet, so I poured out quite a bit of it and added about 1 tbsp of butter to the pan (wanted the butter for the flavor).  There still was a little bit of fat in my non-stick ceramic skillet after the veggies were cooked, so I just browned my cakes in there, didn't start over with a clean skillet and more oil; that worked great, and they browned beautifully.  I think all of the ingredients are there for outstanding mashed potato cakes, but you'll just need to adjust them to your personal tastes.  For example, next time, I'll add more hot sauce for just a little more zing of spiciness.  Good recipe, just needs some customization.",
