                "reviewBody": "This dip was a big hit. My husband took it to work and THEY DEVOURED IT! It was gone before it got cold. First of all, the recipe says to \"spread\" the ingredients into the baking dish. VERY IMPORTANT: Mix them well in a bowl first, then spread them into the baking dish. This is not a layered dish. It will not look \"presentable\" if there are chunks of ingredients all over the place. I used real roasted garlic. It isn't really a big step, and it does make a difference. You won't have difficulty peeling the soft garlic if you pound on the clove with the side of a wide knife. It comes right out. I also followed other suggestions and used a whole package of cream cheese. I used Bertolli alfredo sauce & it doesn't have a metallic flavor like other store bought sauces can have. Next time I make it, I'll keep it warm in my electric crock pot (If it lasts that long).\n\nEdited to add: \nI made little filo dough cups in a mini muffin tin. I filled them with this dip that I heated in the microwave. I topped them with shredded asiago & romano cheese and melted it in the oven for about 4 min. I topped them with chopped tomatoes & they were a real HIT!\nFor the filo dough cups:\nLayer 3 sheets of filo dough with cooking spray between each layer. Cut into, 18 squares. Put each square into mini muffin tins and bake for 5-7 min at 350.",

I don't layer the ingredients, just stir everything together, pour in a casserole and bake till bubbly. I serve it with slices of hot, crunchy garlic toast. Fantastic!",

I tried this recipe and his eyes literally lit up!  This recipe was so easy to make, that I couldn't believe it.  I used store bought garlic that was already chopped and also added a little extra salt.  (I eliminated the need to bake garlic first and just mixed the garlic in with all the other ingredients).  It truly tasted like an Applebee's dip....or even better.  My entire prep. time was approx. 5 minutes.  The suggested cook time was absolutely perfect.  My husband asked me to make this recipe for the next food day at his job!!!!  This is truly a 5 star recipe.",

Mix everything very well to get the best blend. Finding the right cooking time was tricky I cook about 15 minutes longer but pull out and check often to find your favorite consistency.

The only change I made in the recipe is to skip roasted garlic part and use whole jar 16oz of CLASSICO\u2019s Roasted Garlic Alfredo sauce and I mixed all the ingredients in a casserole dish before I put it in the oven.  To turn this recipe into a gourmet dish, you can add one pound of small shrimp.   Very good recipe and very easy to prepare.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.",
