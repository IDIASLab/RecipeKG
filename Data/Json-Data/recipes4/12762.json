I cut the chicken into cubes used about 3 tsp garam masala used a white onion instead of green onions and also added peas like other reviewers. Then I served it over white rice. Oh and I also added some extra salt too. I found a pre-made garam masala spice at my local health food store in the bulk spice section and that is what I used. This was my first attempt at an Indian inspired dish and was very happy with the results! Will definitely make again!",

Although I don't think this is a very authentic Indian recipe it' still very tasty. I think the author could have added that it should be served with basmati rice because it just doesn't make it alone. I made it just as written (but served it with rice) next time I'll add something to it - maybe green peas would be a good addition. Hubby gave it a 4 and I agree. It's a good way to use boneless chicken and is relatively low fat. I thought it was very very good but it's not \"the best light chicken dish I ever had\".",
