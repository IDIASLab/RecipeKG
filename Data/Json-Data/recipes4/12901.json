The only changes I made were, 1) adding about 1/2 cup of chopped onions to the hot oil and rice, and 2) to use a light-flavored olive oil rather than vegetable oil, in keeping with my efforts to make healthier food choices. I didn't have to alter the amount of water, or change the recipe in any other way. Not sure why onions would not be included in the recipe, though. To me, onions are the backbone of flavorful, savory cooking. I love how these patties were not dry or cardboard-like, as so many vegetarian \"meat\" recipes can be. Thank you for this recipe, SHECOOKS2. It is a keeper! Even my meat-and-potatoes husband liked them. ",

After 40 minutes the rice/lentils still had a lot of water so I just took the lid off and let it simmer until it thickened up. My food processor was too small to fit it all in so I just did the lentils and rice in there and then threw it all in my stand mixer. That worked fine. I don't love that they are fried but they are soooo tasty. What a treat! I can't wait to try them as \"meatballs\" or as a lettuce wrap. I have one in the oven to see how they bake up and it looks good so far. Update....I have made this several times now...all very tasty. My favorite way is to freeze them uncooked individually packaged and I just thaw them as needed. I cook them in an iron skillet with a little oil.",

Tonight, they were great!  When I browned the uncooked rice, I added a medium chopped onion and two chopped stalks of celery along with three cloves of garlic.  I used Lundberg's rice blend of red, brown and wild rice. When the grains were cooked, I simply stirred them into the bread crumb & egg mixture, added 1/2 tsp pepper and 1 TBSP Italian seasoning, and fried the patties in olive oil.  The texture is way better when you don't use a food processor.  Don't mash the grains at all, as they are mushy enough!",

I baked them for 30 minutes at 400 and they were delicious! the other thing I must have gotten wrong was the processing because these had no semblance of meat texture and of course they didn't taste like meat so I don't think I will be able to pass them off as meatballs. they taste like mashed potato actually. but they are really tasty and my 2 little kids gobbled them up so I can't complain!

I'm not a connoisseur of veggie patties but I would guess as far as those go it is probably pretty darn good. I would recommend these to vegetarians; however I'd be hesitant to recommend them to others - it didn't wow me. I followed the recipe as is. In order to get a really thick consistency as required it took me significantly longer to cook than directed. I ended up cooking them on low without the cover at the end. This recipe makes a lot! It wouldn't all fit in my food processor. Some of it I just stirred by hand and the consistency was fine. The patties cooked up nicely (give them some time to cool so they aren't too sticky) by just using cooking spray. I cooked them on medium-high heat until browned.",
