I used an iron skillet to prepare this in as it allows me to get the heat very high before I put the steaks in (which makes them crusty and seals in the juices).  I also sauted mushrooms and added to the sauce.  I used rib eye steaks,  fresh rosemary and beef broth.  I also used Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper...it does make a difference.  This is really an excellent recipe...a steak I would expect to get in an upscale restaurant.",

I think this would also be great for some thick boneless pork loin chops, like pork marsala. The sauce was to die for. Served with some mashed potatoes and drizzled some of the sauce on the potatoes. For a nice presentation, I took a long piece of fresh rosemary and placed it in the potatoes leaning over on the filet. Husband loved this. My mouth is watering now -- I think I will make this again tonight. Thank you for this great recipe!",

I stumbled upon a 2 pound package of filet mignon marked down \"Reduced for Quick Sale\"  for half price at my favorite market.  I always have Marsala on hand to make Veal Marsala.  After searing the steaks, I placed them in the oven set at 200 to keep them warm.  I sauted the garlic, some shallots, and some sliced crimini mushrooms, then added 1 tsp tomato paste and let it start to brown.  Added 1 1/2 cups Marsala (no broth) and reduced it to 1 cup.  Added 4 Tblsp butter whisked in 1 T at a time, and finished the sauce with a squirt of lemon juice and some freshly chopped parsley.  Delicious!",
