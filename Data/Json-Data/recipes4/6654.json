There's nothing wrong with this it's just a tad too bland for my liking. My husband seemed to like this but I don't think he'll be disappointed if I never made this again. On a more positive note I must say that the equivalents of each component (i.e. breadcrumb & cheese mixtures) was SPOT on. So many times I'll end up with a TON of leftover breading or filling ingredients. It's always a shame that so much goes to waste but I didn't have that problem this time (hooray!). An Alfredo rice side dish and garlic bread rounded out our Italian-themed meal. Thanks for sharing your recipe CSLUSH. Even though I wasn't a fan I'm glad to have given this a try nonetheless!:-)",
