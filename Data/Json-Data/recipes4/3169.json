It's very easy, except that you have to find out where to score some garam masala. It's not in any grocery stores in my area. I had to find a hidden away Indian store. You can also make your own.",

I served it with brown rice and watercress salad. I believe this can be used on almost any meat/seafood with success...Thanks Evin!",

Absolutely delicious the first night and equally so the next day for lunch! I did have to remove the cooked chicken pieces to a bowl and reduce the sauce to my desired thickness and then return the chicken to the sauce. I turned the heat off and covered the skillet and it sat for @1/2 hour until all were ready for dinner and then reheated quickly. What a great make-ahead entree this will be!
