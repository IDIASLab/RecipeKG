So as I was saying no one really noticed the bacon so Id suggest doubling the bacon and the other thing I would suggest is making double the cheese sauce as I  found the sauce soooo good but didn't seem like enough to me I think id it really saucy. My mother and sister in law thought it was enough but I guess its all a matter of preference. Regardless this was definitely a keeper and I will be making it again. Thanks for the recipe.",
