I also baked it uncovered to try to compensate for the liquidiness but it was still too watery in my opinion. 2nd there is no salt and pepper in this recipe but it definitely needs it. I sprikled salt and pepper over the spinach layer and over the top sauce layer and this was sufficient. 3rd I didn't add the final layer of mozzarella cheese until the final 10 min of baking. This worked well. (I added some parmasan to the top layer as well which definately enhanced the flavor.) I didn't use carrots simply for personal taste but after the modifications the flavor was very good. Just too much liquid.",
