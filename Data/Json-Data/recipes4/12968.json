Mine browned perfectly in 3-4 minutes per side on medium heat. I did add a little extra hot sauce to the batter. I was underwhelmed with the tomato sauce for this. I's a little time consuming to reduce the water out of it and then you're left with a relatively bland conconction. You could tweak aroud with it and get it more interesting and flavorful or you can skip it altgether and use your favorite salsa. I was tempted to give this recipe a 3 because of it but I decided that the potatoes were worth a good rating. I'll make them again thanks!",
