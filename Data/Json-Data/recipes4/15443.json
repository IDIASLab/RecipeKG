It's always a hit, even with friends and family who do not normally care for Stroganoff. Goes great with rolls. Also, I have tried using reduced-fat and fat-free sour cream. Turns out okay with reduced fat but I did not like it with the fat-free sour cream.",

Next time I think I will use beef broth rather than water. Thanks for the great and easy recipe:)",

I did have to alter slightly only out of necessity and use a can of cream of mushroom instead of two golden mushroom acai only had one can....still great. It almost reminds me of Swedish meatballs from the nutmeg and cloves. I used the same quantity of black pepper and it gave it a nice little kick not too much as my toddler still ate it with a mmmmmm. Oh and I added a little garlic powder when adding the salt and pepper only because I add garlic something to almost every dinner I make. Definitely try this if you like stroganoff and Swedish meatballs as its a nice blend of both.",
