My husband loved it and I would not hesitate serving to guests.  Definitely better served over grits than rice. I used fresh garlic and half and half as that was what was on hand.  Turned out great.

Overall tasted great, I think next time I'll try giving it some heat with a chopped hot pepper and another dimension by adding fresh cilantro.     My philosophy is always go with the fresh natural ingredients so I'd always go for a clove or two of garlic rather than the garlic salt or powder.",
