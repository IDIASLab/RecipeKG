Although we didn't have cucumber and avocado sushi, I am giving this recipe a 5 because we wouldn't have otherwise made it without this recipe inspiring confidence (this is a VERY easy dish).  We used things we had in the fridge to make our own \"unique\" sushi rolls.  They included (1) Pepperoni Pizza Sushi Roll: Use several pepperoni to make a line on the rice, add some mozzarella, a line of spagetti or tomato sauce (we used tomato basil sauce we had left over), sprinkle with crushed red pepper and garlic salt; (2) Roast Beef Sushi Roll:  a line of roast beef (we used sandwich meat) on the sushi roll, a line of cream cheese, and a line of red bell pepper;  (3) Turkey Sushi Roll: a line of sandwich turkey, line of avacado, line of wasabi sauce, line of cream cheese.  We also had several dipping sauces on hand, eg soy sauce, wasabi sauce, and spicy ranch (we couldn't find sushi mayo).  It was delicious, we are making more this week for a dinner party.  My boyfriend and his best friend stopped by during our meal and also LOVED the sushi!",

I haven't seen that instruction given in any of the recipes I've seen here. \n\nOne might try different brands of rice vinegar; personally, I prefer a nice mild seasoned one. In a pinch, one can use white vinegar with sugar added--use far less than you would rice vinegar, add a little and sample the rice while cooling, adding more as necessary, flipping/folding delicately with your rice paddle. \n\nAll in all, this is a decent and simple recipe.
