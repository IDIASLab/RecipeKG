To get 1 cup I boiled 1 1/3 c water added 2/3 c raw rice reduced heat to low covered and simmered for 25 minutes. Next time I will just use leftover rice. I did not use the butter but I did add some spices. I was worried the rice wouldn't form a crust without egg in it as others I have seen. It stayed together just fine. For the filling I beat together 4 eggs 1/2 c milk 1/4 tsp pepper 2 c broccoli florets and 1 c ham. I baked this at 375 for 20 mins. Then I added 1 c shredded cheddar baked another 10 mins and then broiled on high until golden. The crispy parts of the rice crust became very hard when reheated for leftovers (actually hurt my teeth) so I don't recommend making this with leftovers in mind. I made garlic parmesan toast as a side but I think a spinach salad would be great. I will definitely make this again for an easy clean out the fridge dinner.",

I had some trouble mashing down the rice-it kept sticking to he spoon- so I started dipping the spoon in water every once in a while-then resorted to clean wet finger. That worked he best. Might not have had the problem if I followed the directions. It did turn out really well though! I just added my usual quiche ingrediNts. Today it was eggs leftover ham onion bell pepper spinach and cherry tomato sliced in half. The eggs soaked into the rice and cooked nicely. Everyone loved the texture. Will definitely be using this method of making a quiche from now on! Thank again!",

I've made it several times and it works well with brown jasmine and basmati rice. I added some herbs to the rice instead of butter and salt. If you like a little spice chili powder is great added to it. I put a layer of shredded cheese in the bottom and it kept the filling from soaking into the rice. The first time I made it the rice sticking up past the filling got a little crisp during baking. It depends on how high your filling is on the sides. The problem was easily solved with some aluminum foil.",
