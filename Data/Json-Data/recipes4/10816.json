(this was his first real meal in five months and he had wanted spaghetti)I'm sorry but I just didn't think it was that spectacular. I agree with those reviewers who said the sauce lacked flavor. It had an odd smell and after taste which I think is due to the onion mix. I'm sure the sauce will taste better today. But if you are looking for a traditional sauce recipe this is not the one for you. As a side note my fiancee liked the sauce and with him coming back from war that's all I cared about.",
