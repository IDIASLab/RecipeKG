I didn't follow the recipe though, this is what I added/did:  1-scraped the eggplant and put the shells in the oven at 350.  2-chopped up half of a very large onion, added a can of mushrooms, and some minced garlic...threw all that into the pan and sprayed with Mazola olive oil spray.  I sauteed all that until it was nice and soft, spraying occasionally with the spray.  Then I added a little of 1/2 pound of sweet italian sausage.  Once that was cooked, I added the eggplant.  Cook a while.  Added generous amount of parsley and a splash of white wine.  3-Added a can of basil, oregano, and garlic diced tomatoes.  4-added less than 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs, plus parmesan and mozzarella cheese.  Filled the shells and popped in the oven.  In the last ten minutes of baking, I sprinkld the top with more mozzarella cheese and breadcrumbs.  DELICIOUS!",

                "reviewBody": "Looking at this recipe I thought it was a really good basis for a stuffed eggplant. I did however change a lot--I used Hot Italian Turkey Sausage (2) and cooked it in about 5 tbsp garlic (since I love garlic). I only used about 1.5 tbsp of olive oil total (I didn't understand why they would originally use that much!) When I added the chopped eggplant I also add very fine chopped mushrooms ( 1.5 cups) and diced sweet onion (half an onion). I didn't have any wine on hand so I put in just a tiny bit of water but found that with all those veggies in the pot there was plenty of liquid. I pretty much kept the spices the same but threw in a bunch of my favorites (I randomly grabbed stuff). I also added about 3/4 cup grated sharp white chedder cheese instead and only added about a cup or so of bread crumbs (enough were there was no liquid and the mixture was smooth--I am not a fan of a lot of bready mixtures). I stuffed the eggplants and baked them for just under 30 min. I thought they were great huge portions (I've had left overs for a few days) and are great with a green salad or as an appetizer. One thing I will do next time is add more onion and reserve some of the stuffing mixture and possibly make patties or something with it so there isn't so much stuffing in the eggplants themselves.",

You do not need all that was given. I always spray with olive oil spray. I also did not use as much breadcrumbs as stated. Only enough to hold together. I also added some celery onion and red bell pepper. My eggplant shells were very soft not hard as other stated as I zapped in microwave for about 2 minutes before filling. My husband and I both loved this and I will make again for sure",

Doubled the recipe to two eggplants had plenty of stuffing with only one pound of sausage and no bread crumbs. My husband is wary of eggplant and went back for seconds. Will make again!!!",
