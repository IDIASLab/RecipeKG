The combination of apple/celery/shiitake is interesting but it works. I used tofu in mine which wasn't a problem. Since I used miso I left out the broth because I figured it would have enough sodium between that and the extra salt and I don't like a lot of salty taste so just use your judgement when it comes to that. Otherwise I'll definitely make this again!",

Celery is mostly water and when blended with the chicken broth and apple it all breaks down to form the base of the soup. It seems there was a bit of an error in the edit/publish on this recipe as my original submission does specify that the celery isn't just a few stalks but an entire head. This may be what was missing when you made it.",

With the miso the salt and all the spices it turns out entirely to salty and spicy and doesn't make much. Two after adding several cups of water to the mixture which took care of the strong taste of seasonings it was lacking substance. It tasted like well seasoned water. I ended up grabbing whatever vegetables I could find in the refrigerator and adding them to this soup. I added two cups of sweet potatoes 1 potato chopped carrots rice etc. After all that it was worth eating and had nice flavors.",

I used low sodium chicken stock and I only added 1/2 tablespoon salt. Also i roasted my garlic head. And at the end I did add a good bit of water to make it more soupy. I will make this again and I will probably use more celery as suggested....sounded like a good idea.",
