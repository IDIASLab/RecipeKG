I also cut the potatoes in halves and put an egg in just one half of each potato. It turned out awesome! My bf is very picky about food and he had a second plate. My daughter however didn't like the peel of the potato so I'd recommend to take it off for your toddlers before chopping everything in small pieces. I will do that again for sure with guests.",
