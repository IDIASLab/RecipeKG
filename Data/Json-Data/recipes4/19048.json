I drained the oats because they were quite watery after an hour of soaking. Maybe if I hadn't, I would have needed the entire 6 cups of flour. Also, after the first hour the dough did not rise a bit. I  took it out of the bowl and kneaded it for five minutes, separated it into two balls, kneaded those each for a couple of minutes, formed loaves and put them in their pans. I turned the oven on for 5 minutes just to warm it then turned it off. I put the loaves in there to rise and it worked. These steps worked an the dough doubled in size in abourt 40 minutes.

I did cut the recipe in half to make 1 loaf--I love being able to do that by changing the serving size and letting Allrecipes do the math!!! I was very pleased with this bread! It is dense but still soft like a sandwich bread. I have all ready made sandwiches with it for the hubby's lunch. It did take awhile to rise...not sure if it was that the oat mixture was too cold when I started adding the other ingredients and the yeast was just slow to activate or it needs a touch more yeast? I love the taste of molasses in a bread and paired with oatmeal it is a winning combo! Thanks for the recipe Swaneeramsey!",

To the person who thought it was too dense, make sure you spoon the flour into the measuring cup, and I still sift. I heated the cooled, soaked oatmeal to 110 degrees to activate the yeast. I also pulled the loaf out of the last proof after 10-15 min, covered it relatively tightly in the fridge overnight and baked the next morning (after letting it come to room temp). This will be our new go-to sandwich bread recipe. Yum!",
