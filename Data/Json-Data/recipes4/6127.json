Flavor and mouthfeel adjustments: used 3 cans of diced green chiles (2 mild, 1 hot), sauteed a yellow onion and 1 clove of garlic with a little chili powder, used a mix of jack and cheddar cheese. Healthier adjustments: did not use any butter, reduced the cheese to 3 cups instead of 4, and used reduced fat cottage cheese.  3 cups of shredded cheese is still plenty for an egg casserole, and the butter serves no purpose in this recipe other than adding flavor (and a ton of extra fat). Also used 1/2 cup of flour as called for in other versions of this recipe floating around on the internet.  I think it needs the extra flour to help it set.  Baked it in a 9x13 casserole dish and it definitely served more than 8!",

This is my go to recipe when taking a meal to someone who just had a baby or is recovering from illness.
