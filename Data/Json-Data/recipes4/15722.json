(2 c chicken broth (veggie broth would work) 1 cup dry polenta or grits, 2 tbs butter, 2 Tbs sour cream, a handful of shredded cheddar and garlic powder, salt, & pepper to taste) I used Red Gold Chili Ready diced tomatoes for some extra spice.I just added a few drops of lemon juice to the olive oil instead of infusing. I sprayed my pie plate with Pam coconut spray. This is a great recipe base that can be used lots of ways with different toppings. So versatile I know I will make it again!",

I don't usually have polenta on hand so I cooked 1/2 cup cornmeal in about 1 1/4 cup water so it would be stiff enough to make a pie crust. I did that a day before and then refrigerated the crust. I used oregano and sliced tomatoes from my garden. I chopped a whole sweet onion by accident and sauted all of it with other vegies and it was still excellent so I think I'll change my recipe to use a whole onion. I think next time I'll lower the temperature to 400 and bake for 20 minutes to heat more.",
