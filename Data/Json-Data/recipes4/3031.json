This recipe tastes just like the one we ordered at that pub - my family loved it! Since it was taking a while for the mix of 3 cheeses to melt on the stove, I put them in the microwave (before adding the wheat beer) for a minute or so, stirred, and then poured them back in the pan on the stove to add the beer.  That really speeded things up.  I had one box of 6 soft SuperPretzels that I heated in the microwave without the salt. Then I cut each pretzel into 6 or so pieces with a pizza cutter. Ideally, we could have used a second box (12 pretzels total)as 6 were not enough. We ended up eating the rest of the dip with Wheat Thins and carrots - it was so good we didn't want any to go to waste!",
