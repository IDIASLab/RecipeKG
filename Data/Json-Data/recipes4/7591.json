He died when I was 11, (I'm 58 now) but one of my fondest memories as a little girl was sitting at our kitchen table together and him teaching me how to make this recipe.  No measurements were used, just peeling and slicing the potatoes and onions and layering in the casserole dish with sprinkled-on flour, small pats of butter, salt and pepper (on each layer), then pouring milk on top just until it peeked through the potatoes at the top.  Sometimes he put pork chops on top before baking.  Best scalloped potato recipe ever!  (Miss you Dad).",

Parmesan, then again - finish with Parmesan which will brown up nicely - & milk just to the edge of the top layer. I don't bother heating it up either. Pop in the oven (on a baking sheet to catch drips)and bake at 350F for probably 1.5 to 2 hrs.(poke a fork in to test doneness). Let sit a bit to let liquid absorb into potatoes! Im' 72 & my mom, grandmother always made them this way. You can also add bacon bits for a nice light flavor and to change it up a tad. My hubby hates Parmesan......& so far has never realized it's in there!!",

A roux works for me too, with a portion of it on each layer, and a bit of extra milk over all.  The milk provides the browned skin over all the potato slices. Today, we rarely peel potatoes, and they are most often \"organic\" so sliced,well-scrubbed, unpeeled but \"edited\" from zits and eyes, works.    To get to au gratin, just cover the dish for the last 20-25 mins. of cooking with your favourite grated cheese mixture.   Hey, works for us!",
