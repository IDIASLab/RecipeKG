I hadn't intended to make the yoghurt dressing but I'm glad I did - it added a lovely cool contrast to the smoky juiciness of the lamb.

My girlfriend loved it and she has HATED lamb every other time she's had it. Now here are the changes and additions I made to the recipe I added about a 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper after I browned the shanks and about 1 tbsp. of sugar to the tomatoe puree to counter some of the acidity. I eliminated 1 cup of the tomatoe puree and 1 cup of chicken stock and substituted 2 cups of red wine instead:) After the braising instead of turning up the oven to 400-degrees I placed the rack high on my oven and turned it on broil. I brushed on the glaze and broiled with a very watchful eye to prevent burning. I made a cilantro oil (bunch of cilantro olive oil salt & pepper blended in a food processor) which complimented the glaze awesomely!! I brushed on some cilantro oil during the broiling process too and it made the world of difference (Flavor town baby!). I served it on a bed of Creamy Cotija cheese and Chive Polenta drizzled with some fresh cilantro oil. Didn't plate the braising liquid becuase I found it unnecessary.",
