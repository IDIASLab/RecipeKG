I'd never  had brie cheese before & it is fantastic - nice & creamy. We did add mushrooms & spinach but isn't necessary, but with you have a meal in itself. Because we used 2 chicken breasts as it called for I had to use 2 pastry sheets so it would cover & seal. Will make again, but it is something special so not on a regular basis.",
