The balance of salt from the cheese spice from the chilies and the herbal aroma of the oregano hit the spot. But... I gave it three stars because although I enjoyed it the flavour was a bit plain. I added some crushed garlic and a bit of rosemary and felt the recipe was better rounded for the changes. But since I am judging on the recipe as it it was just a bit of a single note so only three stars.",

I wouldn't add anything else to this recipe as the contrast between salty/sour and spicy as well as the creamy texture of the baked feta are quite enough to make a great little dish! Note that feta doesn't 'melt' the way most cheeses do so you will find that the slice of feta will hold its shape. But it should be soft and bubbly throughout. You'll want to serve right away because the feta will harden as it cools. And most importantly please use FULL FAT feta and preferably Greek feta from sheep and goat milk. Cow milk feta and low fat feta will not produce similar results! Enjoy!",

Just the other day with friends I crushed up some dried chilis I stored in a jar from last year's garden and boy oh boy what an amazing flavour! We BBQ'd 2 large 1/4 inch slabs and ate them with garlic buttered toasted pitas and everyone including kids was ranting and raving over the flavour. So simple and so good.",
