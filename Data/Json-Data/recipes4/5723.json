I had one at dinner my husband had two and each of my boys had one but we didn't really like the taste - too tangy and salty. So after dinner since we still had a lot left I took out the filling added more mustard and horseradish to combat the mayonnaise taste and added just a pinch or two of sugar to neutalize the saltiness. After all of that it tasted pretty good.",
