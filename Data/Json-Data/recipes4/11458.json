I added lots more veggies (whatever I found in the fridge worked for me) and I served over basmati rice. It was delicious and a great one pot meal.

I cut the onions into quarters and chopped all the veggies into large chunks. I served this with jasmine rice and we loved it. My only issue was the ammount of curry... I was using homemade cury from India and 2 T was WAY too much for me. 1 would have been fine. Overall- I think this dish relies heavily on the quality of the curry mix you use. It was easy and tasted great once I figured out the correct amount of curry to use.",

I followed the suggestion of a prior user and used boneless-skinless chicken breasts to make the cooking go faster and easier.
