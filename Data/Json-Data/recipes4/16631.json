However I bought the stuff and made it anyways. Long story short my wife said that it wasn't terrible just a bit strong. I did remove the garlic pieces but left cinnamon stick inside the cup. Today she looked and felt so much better. Was it the tea? Who knows but I will definitely keep this recipe for the next cold. Thanks allrecipes!!",
