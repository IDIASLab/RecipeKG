Some tips that I think will solve other's problems: 1. You don't need water, the yogurt produces a nice creamy sauce without it. 2. If you think it's bland, add more garlic and hot sauce/cayanne. 3. To avoid the curdle problem altogether, wisk the sauce ingredients together and add to the completed dish w/out heating.  The heat of the noodles and veggies will warm the sauce plenty. Enjoy!",

Instead of taking the time to strain the healthy whey out of the yogurt just decrease the water according to how thin your yogurt is. Also it is too runny to begin with so either way you should decrease the amount of water. Also there are tons of other options for the veggies. I also used cayenne instead of hot sauce and added cumin. I also used an extra tablespoon of tahini. Do be extra careful to not overheat it though because it will curdle and there is no going back after that. I love it!",

In fact I think there are far better choices than those suggested (and a lot more of them) including peppers of all colours carrots red onion asparagus... Definitely too much water in the recipe; I use half of what's recommended. Parmesan cheese or feta cheese are both good toppings. I have also substituted 1/2 lime for the lemon and it's good. Good recipe great taste. Leftovers also very good.",

This is a keeper and it seems like one can go in many directions in terms of veggies and added spices herbs. I used mostly the same ingredients (but for eg. used low fat yogurt instead and diff veggies) and eyeballed quantity bc I planned to use 1/2 box of ziti. I used a full bag frozen veggies. I sauteed chicken cut up with chopped onion. Threw in some chopped fresh parsley. I added cumin and paprika and ground cayenne to the sauce. Also I did not added the recommended water to the sauce I ended up saving pasta water to thin down if needed after all was mixed. The sauce I added after everything was mixed to avoid curdling as per one of the other users suggestions (avoiding heating over a flame.) It worked. I am curious to try this with kalamata olives and sauteed red peppers or another time with mushrooms. BTW the sauce has a tang to it.",
