WARNING:  Please do not add seasoned salt as the other reviewer suggested until you make the recipe as directed!  This was seasoned perfectly as written.  Added the minced garlic to the dressing and poured over breasts, moving them slightly to make sure they're nicely coated.  Cooked chicken 4 hrs. as directed and mine were actually done by that time.  Softened the cream cheese in microwave for 30 sec. in a bowl and then blended the soup.  Took the chicken out and poured the soup mixture in the crockpot w/ the juice from the chicken, mixing thoroughly and then replaced the chicken back.  OMGsh, it was so good that we didn't even wait for me to cook the noodles.  Anyway, saved the rest for the next day and it reheated beautifully.  Maybe I'll be able to actually get some noodles cooked to go w/ it today--LOL!",

I didn't have a garlic clove, so I mixed in 1/4 tsp of granulated garlic with the dressing mix/water. I added mushroom soup instead of chicken because I did not have mushrooms. For the last hour of cooking, I shredded the chicken and added more water to make more of a gravy. It turned out beautifully and was delicious over noodles. I even used nonfat cream cheese and thought overall it was a pretty healthy and delicious recipe with no butter oil, or cheese needed like the traditional alfredo! Thanks for a yummy keeper!",

I'm a garlic junkie and actually used a handful of cloves and I used fat free cream cheese and low fat or fat free...can't remember which...cream of chicken soup to make it a little less fattening. Turned out great. I also used a bunch of fresh mushrooms...many more than 4.5 ounces as my boyfriend and I both love them. Also added cracked black pepper to taste and topped with shaved Parmesan cheese. This dinner was so easy...will definitely be making again.",

When we were done, I cooked up lots more spaghetti to combine with the sauce before storing leftovers.  Changes I made to recipe: -Used only 2 chicken breasts -Removed chicken from cooking liquid and set aside, then mixed in soup/crm cheese for sauce. -Diced chicken and returned it to cooking sauce. -Added 1 cup green peas to sauce, next time will add more.",
