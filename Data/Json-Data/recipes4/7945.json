The submitter remarks that this is a good way to \"Add some oomph to those boring mashed potatoes!\" but I confess my potatoes weren't boring to begin with since I used leftover twice-baked potatoes from a very nice steakhouse.  So instead of starting with just some boring boiled potatoes, I simply mashed my leftover potatoes that included  applewood bacon, white cheddar and parmesan cheese.  I slipped them out of the skin, mashed them up and, to guarantee they became crispy and brown, I fried them in clarified butter. These were so darned good I'd make them again, and in exactly the same way.  They're worth ordering this potato again (or using your own leftovers) just to make this recipe.",

The one change we make is to form the leftovers into individual patties about the size of a hamburger. We fry both sides and serve them with a fried egg for breakfast.

Also, once you drain the potatoes mash the garlic along with them. Then, rectify of salt and pepper. I did this but also added a little bit of milk and butter to make the mashed potatoes. I let it rest as I made the potato mash ahead. This helped the flavors to meld a bit better. To fry and for practical purposes, I sprayed the olive oil with a dedicated olive oil spray bottle. It uses less and you can easily adjust if you need more or less without risking to use too much. As I fried the potato mash I sprinkled Italian parsley for extra kick of a mild flavor. I will make this recipe again with my additions. The recipe is versatile to add flavorings. Next time, I would add cooked bacon to the mash and I would have a meal on its own.",
