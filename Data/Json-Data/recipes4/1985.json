Here's one thing I often do: simply place a standard-size cooling rack inside your baking dish and place the meatloaf atop that so that the fattier liquids run off and do not soak the loaf as it cooks. If your cooling rack won't fit simply roll aluminum foil \"logs\" (three should do) to support the meatloaf in the pan. One last thing: this is obviously a cornbread/pepperjack/jalapeno version. You could change the theme entirely by focusing on changing the bread/cheese/veggie versions (... for example I've used sourdough bread crumbs mozzarella and sun-dried tomatoes). Adjust additional spices if any accordingly. Enjoy!:)",

For the cornbread (1/2 cup) buy a box of cornbread muffin mix and use 1/2 cup dry mix instead of 1/2 crumbled baked muffins. WORKS GREAT. I did that the first time and have done it since using a box of corn muffin mix for this recipe only and storing the remainder in the fridge until next time. Try that folks trust me it works!",

I made it close to as written w/a few minor changes. I used only a little over 1 pound of very lean ground beef and scaled everything else down. Per prior reviews I used dry cornbread mix rather than cornbread (and I probably ended up using close to 1 C til it seemed a good consistency). I used canned Mexicorn blend (and if I make this again I will use frozen corn...did not care for the strong \"canned corn\" taste) & jarred diced jalaps (about 3 heaping tsps full as the store was out of fresh jalaps). I didn't really measure much just eyeballed as usual. I made in muffin tins rather than in a traditional loaf for individual servings and had NO problem w/grease whatsoever. I baked for about 35 min at 350. The consistency was excellent firm yet moist and it had a unique flavor. THANK YOU for a nice twist to boring old meat loaf!",
