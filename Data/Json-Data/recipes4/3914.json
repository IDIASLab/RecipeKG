I left out the green onion and decided to saut\u00e9 the onion before adding it to the meatball mixture to add a little more moisture. I was able to get 15 nice sized mini meatballs.  I jar my own marinara which has all fresh ingredients so I chose to use that for the sauce, I used whole wheat rolls for the subs, and I also used low moisture, low fat mozzarella.    ",
