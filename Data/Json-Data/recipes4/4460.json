I oiled the pan with olive oil which I was glad about because the slices were a little sticky to pan. I simply sliced the eggplant dipped them in egg then parmesan cheese and seasoned with garlic. Then baked til golden brown then topped with sauce and more parmesan cheese. I love this simple recipe. The meal was sooo yummy. Ill definitely use this recipe again. Thank you so much.",

I wanted to let you know that when I made it last night I used a few of the baked eggplant rounds to create mini \"pizzas.\" Spread just a little sauce on top and then added the cheese. My kids ate them with their hands - just like little pizzas. 7-year-old and 2-year-old loved it!",

I have been making eggplant parmesan for years and love it but it is a lot of work and time consuming. This was just as good and so much quicker & easier to prepare! Loved the crispy coating and the spicy sauce! I did cover my baking pan with tin foil and sprayed w/ olive oil to prevent sticking. Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe....will be making this a lot!!!",
