Instead of the canned cheddar soup, I used 2 cups of shredded Mild Cheddar cheese, mixed in 8 ounces of sour cream, and 1 can of cream of chicken soup, undiluted.  Also just before serving time, I threw most of it into a greased baking dish, put crushed cornflakes doused in butter on top of that, and put it in the oven for about 10 minutes or so to crisp up the top.  Fabulous!  Will make this again.  Very easy.",

There are never any leftovers.  :)  In an attempt to make it more healthy, i made the following adjustments.  I used lite sour cream, skim evaporated milk, and omitted the french fried onion.  I replaced the bacon with 2T of \"Tastefully Simple\" Bacon Bacon.  even with these changes to my recipe, it got rave reviews.  I just love this recipe!!!!!",
