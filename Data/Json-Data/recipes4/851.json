                "reviewBody": "I am the submitter of this recipe and it IS a soup. However it can be changed easily to make a stew. Increase the meat to 3 to 3.5 pounds. Cut the liquids in half (meaning 1 can chicken broth one can beef consomme or stock.) Mix 1/2 cup of flour into the cool stock before adding to the pot then stir until the mixture comes to a simmer in order to keep it smooth. Vegetables can be tailored to suit your taste. Root veggies are good like turnip or yams. You can use less onion if you like (should read 2 SMALL onions ) and omit the green beans and mushrooms if you don't like them. Use more or less pepper as you prefer. THIS RECIPE IS EASILY TAILORED TO YOUR TASTE. i.e. if you don't like lots of onion cut it back to one. Use more spice if you like stronger flavors or more garlic if that's the way you like things. Omit the tomato sauce and/or crushed tomatoes if you don't like your soup somewhat tomatoey - if you do feel free to add some fresh chopped tomato. Cut the vegetables in chunks instead of mincing if you like it heartier. If you have a crock pot smaller than the largest size for which this recipe was created be sure to cut down on your liquids. Use whatever is needed to fill your particular pot to no more than 3/4 full then STOP ADDING LIQUID. The crock pot should NEVER be filled to overflowing - that's just plain common sense. Important: Taste for salt before serving and adjust as necessary. That should always be your last step before serving any dish.",

Next time I will leave out the tomato sauce - didn't seem to add much except extra liquid. In order to thicken the stew though (which was surprisingly thin even with the flour) I had to add 2 tbsp. of corn starch/cold water an hour before eating and that did the trick. This makes A LOT and I think that the amount affects the cooking time - I cooked it for 8 hours on low then 6 hours on high because after 8 hours the potatoes were still hard and the meat still chewy. Next time I'll go with 6-10 hours on high. Thanks Cat!",

I used much less - I made this with 16oz stewing meat and ended up using one can of beef broth one can of diced tomatoes and a maybe 2/3 of the tomato can filled with water. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was quite bland. So I added more freshly-ground black pepper some Italian seasoning and an Oxo cube which helped but it was still lacking something. I think maybe a few cups of red wine reduced during the cooking time might have helped. Overall I thought this was good but not great.",
