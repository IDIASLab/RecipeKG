Creaming butter, eggs and sugar together creates air pockets in the batter, and as the batter bakes, these air pockets create a light, fluffy product. Butter also contains water, which evaporates during baking, which can also cause the baked good to rise. Eggs have a number of roles in baked goods, but their starring role is as a binder. The protein in the eggs gives structure to the batter so it's neither stiff nor crumbly, but the eggs also act as a leavener when they're beaten with butter and sugar. Folding beaten egg whites into a batter serves the same purpose.",
