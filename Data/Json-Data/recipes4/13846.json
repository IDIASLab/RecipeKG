This recipe looks smells and tastes like the original from what I can tell. I suppose I'd have to eat them side by side to know for sure. It's so easy - barely any prep - and freezes well too! The only thing I did differently is used less water than called for in the recipe. I didn't pour it all in at once adding 1/2 cup at a time until I reached the consistency I like. It's yummy!",

I made this for me and my husband with veggie burgers and I used tofu crumbled up for the hot sauce.  They came out great!  My (non-vegetarian) husband said they tasted just like Nick Tahou's!  I didn't have the allspice or thyme but the hot sauce was delicious!! To make it with the tofu I squeezed out the excess water and baked the tofu at 375 for about 25 minutes to get rid of some of the water.  Then I simmered the tofu adding a little oil and all the ingredients and then added water until it was the right consistency.  You really can't taste the tofu (and what a healthy alternative!).  This sauce was really great and the garbage plates hit the spot!",
