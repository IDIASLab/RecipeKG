I bought \"cool-whip\" LITE. not sure if it was my tub or a characteristic of \"lite\" products but by the time I added the lemon yogurt I was too afraid to frost the cake & let it sit in the fridge over night because it wasn't very stiff. I figured the next morning all the whip would be on the plate & not the cake! So to remedy that we just spooned the \"frosting\" onto our own pieces of cake. Those who wanted more took more those who wanted less took less! Everybody was happy. Presentation wasn't as nice as a frosted cake...but boy! It was yummy.",
