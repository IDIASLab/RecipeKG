This is easy, no fuss, and convenient on the refills. Bless YOU. The only thing I would change next time is add about 1/2 more whiskey. THe recipe is not strong, which is good for a crowd.

I think the ingredient proportions are really off on this recipe.  There's too much orange juice and water, and not enough lemonade and bourbon.  It tasted watered down and almost void of any bourbon.  I made adjustments, so it was drinkable, but I won't be making this again.  Sorry CookingGirl for the bad review, but this was a disappointment.",
