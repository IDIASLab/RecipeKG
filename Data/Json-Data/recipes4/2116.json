Didn't have sherry vinegar so followed others suggestions and used apple cider vinegar.  It was a little strong, so I'd bring that down to 2.5 T.  I used a can diced tomatoes with green chiles for flavor and added the cumin and coriander suggested by others.  I think I would puree only one can of the black beans and put in two cans whole, but that's personal preference, I like soup a little chunky.  Skipped the ham (didn't want the additional sodium) and did add a dollop of fat free sour cream that I'd mixed with fresh chives first from baked potatoes the night before.  It wasn't mentioned in the directions, but once all the ingredients are in the pot, bring to a boil and then reduce to a med/low simmer for the balance of the cooking time, rather than straight medium the entire time.  Nice recipe, thanks for sharing!",

I use dried beans, and if anyone is interested - a 1 pound bag of dry black beans yields 6 cups of cooked beans. A can of beans is roughly 2 cups, so a 1 pound bag is exactly what you need for this recipe. I cook the beans using the gas free method (http://www.recipezaar.com/Basic-Dried-Beans-49960) then use a little water when pureeing as they tend to be a little drier than the canned version. I also use vegetable broth and add 1/4 tsp cayenne and 1 tsp cumin. Delicious, thanks!",
