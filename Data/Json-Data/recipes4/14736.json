It has a little bit of a kick to it from the chili powder, and the orange juice and pumpkin pie spice really bring out the flavors.  It was originally based on 'Daddy's Pumpkin Soup.' I think some lemon juice or orange zest would do as well for the orange juice.",

I almost went 4 stars since I will not say this is something to rave about but, then again, it is not a main-course type soup.  Compared to my expectation  it was quite good.  Salt & pepper to taste when eating was needed but otherwise I followed the recipe almost to the word.  I used some green onions instead of regular and replaced the pumpkin pie spice with cinnamon, nutmeg, clover and ginger (which is just a recipe for pumpkin pie spice).  My 5 star rating is also because I wanted a way to work some other vegetables into my diet and this soup allows me to add pumpkin without making a desert dish.   Regarding step 2:  My soup seemed to be fully pureed without this step.  I did, however, have a stick blender so used it quickly right in the pot to further refine the consistency.  It seems like you could skip this step if you finely dice the onions and the pumpkin is already well pureed.",

I used a large onion finely chopped and pureed it with an emmersion blender when I added the water for a creamier texture. I used more water than called for to thin the soup out. As suggested once I added salt and pepper I like it! Made about 3/4ths of a gallon. I'll be taking it with my lunch to work. I think the addition of a chicken or vegetable broth would have added lots of depth however I do like it. The spicy kick works for me! Oh I added a bit less of the chili powder for my taste. Thanks for sharing. I had some coconut milk and needed to do something with the frozen pureed pumpkin I'd made from my Halloween pumpkins. Utilized both at the same time!",
