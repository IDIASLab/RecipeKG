I used eggplant, zucchini, green bell pepper, vidalia onion and sliced roma tomatoes.  I didn't have fresh herbs, so I used one tsp. each of dried oregano, basil and parsley.  I only had two small cloves of garlic, so I used them with some garlic powder.  I also added a little white sugar.  I used a grill basket and it worked out perfectly. I served the veggies with marinated grilled salmon and they complemented eachother perfectly! The only problem was that the eggplant looked very unappetizing...it turned a brown-black color, but it tasted fine.  It must be something I did.  I will definately make this again and again.  Thank you!",

He made asparagus red & yellow bell peppers baby portabella mushrooms red onions and eggplant. Instead of grilling he sauted them in a huge wok....you'll need a really big pan if you use the original portion scale. Anyway we both loved how it turned out. Like one of the other reviewers the eggplant did turn black while cooking. It wasn't very appealing to look at but it was probably the most flavorful eggplant i've ever had. We'll definitely use this one again.",
