Beef and chicken livers work well too. If you cook a whole chicken in a pressure cooker to soften the bones you can puree that to use in the recipe as well but no whole bones... or add bonemeal which is preferable anyway. As others mentioned... the sodium content is of concern. The garlic in moderation is Ok but that said... don't add it everytime you make this. Garlic is good for helping to control fleas but at the same time it can cause anemia in our little furry friends. Use brown rice and add vegetables like pumpkin (good source of fiber) carrots peas beans etc. Also add brewers yeast (not the same as active yeast)!! Oh... use olive oil. And I'm not sure what's up with the thyme... I can't say it's harmful but until I find out for sure... better omit it. These are dogs afterall... not people!",
