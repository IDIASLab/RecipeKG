This side dish is so yummy, I sometimes make it even when it's not Thanksgiving! Depending on your salad's shape, you can spread the topping in a layer over the Jell-O; or if you use a ring mold, put the topping in the center. Alternately, you could serve the topping in a bowl on the side, so it's optional.",
