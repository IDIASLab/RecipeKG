The middle isn't firm it's actually kind of watery. I think it was all the extra fluid from the asparagus and the mushrooms. Despite 5 eggs it's not very eggy? I would put this more in the realm of a pot pie than a quiche. Two the asparagus makes it hard to cut without having the filling fall out everywhere. This could be remedied by peeling the stems but next time I will just dice them because I like the extra fiber. Three this recipe is a little salty what with all the cheese. I may leave the salt out entirely next time. I did make a few modifications. I left out the Monterrey Jack because this recipe was already insanely calorie dense and I figured one type of cheese would be enough. I'm glad I did because of the saltiness. I also left out the rotisserie chicken instead using two chicken breasts cooked in just lemon juice and green onions for filling. This made it nicely tart which complimented the asparagus and cheese flavor. Overall I would definitely make this again. It is a really good pie even if it's not a quiche.",

I also didn't use the herbs listed...I just used the \"Salad Elegance\" spice mix from Penzey's since I didn't have parsley. I also made it as individual tartlets rather than a large pie. (The filling (asparagus plus chicken cheese mix) would have easily made 6 - 7 tarts but the egg mixture ran out at four. I'll mix up another batch of eggs to use with the remaining filling. ) Tartlets still took about 40 minutes to cook so I imagine a larger quiche would have taken even longer to firm up.
