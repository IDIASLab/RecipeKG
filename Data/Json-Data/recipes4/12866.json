I used fresh thyme and only had 1 squirrel so I cut everything by 1/3 with the exception of still using 18 dates which I forgot to reduce to 6. I added a bit of black pepper as well. This was the first time I have ever cooked or eaten squirrel and I thought the recipe was phenomenal! I will definitely try this with rabbit as well. I would be interested in trying it with the wine substitution but I thought it tasted excellent as is.  I think my mistake of not reducing the dried fruit added a hint of sweet to the gravy and I love the fresh thyme along with that slight sweetness. I will definitely make this again if I have a squirrel to cook up. I think this would be excellent served with a jasmine date rice for a side, or garlic mashed potatoes, along with roasted parsnips, carrots and beets.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
