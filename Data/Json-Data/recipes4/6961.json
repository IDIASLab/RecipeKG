I did add more peanut butter (probably close to 1/4 cup) which made them a little soft for cutting into bars but the taste was spot on. I didn't have candy corn so I topped it with the peanuts M&Ms and mini peanut butter cups from Trader Joe's. This is a great recipe for using up your leftover candy. I'll be making these again over the weekend for when their friends come over. Quick and easy treat.",
