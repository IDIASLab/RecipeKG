I made it with reduced fat Ritz crackers, 98% fat free soup, light sour cream and half the butter and it still came out great! (but not low-fat)\nI noticed that some reviewers thought this was somewhat lacking in flavor, so I sprinkled the chicken with basil, oregano and garlic powder and browned it before adding water and simmering it for about 15 minutes. I prepared the chicken the night before while making dinner so I could have cooked, chopped chicken all ready to go. \nAs suggested by another reviewer, I stirred the chicken, soup and sour cream together in a bowl before putting it in the casserole dish.\nServe with bread and  some steamed veggies.",

I browned the chicken before simmering it in chicken broth for 15 minutes which gave it tons of flavor.  I also sauteed onion and celery as a previous reviewer suggested and added it to the cream of chicken and sour cream mixture.  I added 2 tablespoons poppy seeds and combined the mixture and the chopped chicken.  The rest was as the recipe stated.  I poured it all in an 8x8 Pyrex, put the crumbs on top, sprinkled a bit more poppy seeds on the crumbs, and lastly drizzled melted butter over the top.  It was soooo rich, I don't see how anyone can claim there's no flavor! :)",
