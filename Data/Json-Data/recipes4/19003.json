There were some minor changes made from the way this recipe was submitted, so I\u2019d like to add that this is best served immediately \u201chot.\u201d  Once you have the sauce consistency to your liking, it\u2019s even best to remove the inner pot, so that the residual heat from the Instant Pot\u00ae will not continue to cook the mac and cheese.  If it\u2019s not served hot, the texture of the cheese sauce will change, as will happen with any creamy mac and cheese side dish.  Also, 2 cups of shredded cheese is about 6 ounces, and 1 cup is about 3 ounces.***12.7.18*** This is in response to the review by Cathy S.  I submitted this recipe as an Instant Pot\u00ae recipe, but it was edited to be more generic to all electric pressure cookers.  AR\u2019s intent on the \u201c10-15 minutes\u201d is just to let you know that it may take that long for the pressure to build before the 4 minute countdown begins.  As far as the \u201c30 minute\u201d saute in the video, if my memory is correct, I think when you first hit the Saute button, it defaults to 30 minutes, and then you make your adjustment in time.  They\u2019re really not telling you to saute for 30 minutes, that would totally destroy the mac & cheese which takes only a few minutes at the Saute function.  Have fun with your new Instant Pot\u00ae.  I know it can be confusing to a new user, but trust me, it gets easier.",
