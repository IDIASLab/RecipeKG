I made the colossal mistake of following the previous reviewers suggestions and pressure cooked the legs for 15 minutes instead of 5.  My legs were stewed to the point of falling off the bone, and the skin was waterlogged and flabby, and slipped off when I removed the turkey from the cooking water.  Had I further followed the instructions and broiled for 45 minutes, my legs would have turned into jerky.  I salvaged what I could, added the barbecue sauce, and broiled for 5 minutes to heat through.  I might try again but please heed my advice, and follow the recipe!",
