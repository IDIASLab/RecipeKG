I did 1 1/2 the recipe and made 1/3 of the liquid milk instead of water to give it creaminess. Incredible! I'll admit I added a few extra things like some black pepper about 6 drops of hot pepper sauce and a little powdered beef stew seasoning and gravy thickener because I was worried it would be too thin. In the end it was phenomenal and the texture was perfect. Like another previous user I also knew the ingredients but not the proportions and this one was right on the money! I also got my kids to taste it as supper is still a couple of hours away and they LOVED it!-- Simple and delicious--it would be hard to go wrong with this recipe as a base. Keep in mind the liquid boils out so if you want a full two cups of gravy change the recipe to say '3 servings' instead of 2. Enjoy!",
