There's something off about the instructions - the marinade isnt actually a marinade but a watery mix of seasonings pineapple etc. Then you're supposed to pour it all into a skillet and cook it. Well the sauce/marinade doesnt evaporate well and the chicken surely doesnt brown and adding cornstarch doesnt help much. I think the recipe provider should take a hard look and make sure this is correct.",

So I added more ginger ale then some chicken broth then I thickend it with the corn starch. I served this over brown jasmine rice I found at Trader Joe's and I did substitute splenda for the sugar to make it a little healthier. Finally I realized I was out of fresh ginger so I ended up substituting 2 tsp. of ground ginger and it was perfect.",

The chicken was a little dry but next time I would cut the chicken strips a little larger so it doesn't overcook by the time the liquid is gone. Also I cooked it about 30 minutes instead of 25. I can see how the liquid would not evaporate if cooked on low heat. I left it on medium high for the duration and left it uncovered. Next time I will add more pineapple and less coconut.",
