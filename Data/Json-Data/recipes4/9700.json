Add 1/4 cup uncooked pearled barley near the end of the cooking time to give the broth a stew-like texture rather than the watery broth you get otherwise.  Also, serve with 1/2 oz of plain goat cheese for great flavor and to (ahem) avoid the gastrointestinal consequence typical of eating beans.  (An enzyme in the cheese enhances digestion of the beans in the small intestine, or something.  :o)",

After dumping the mix in the crockpot I add 3 jars of water per jar of mix. (Takes 2 for our medium-sized family.) I buy high-end beans at the health food store so they are already triple-washed. I don't pay attention to the bean mix in the recipe use whatever beans I want and go for some variety so its pretty in the jars. (Easy gifts too.) I use vegeterian boullion and skip the bacon bits so I'm not limited when feeding vegeterians. The thing I like most about this is it is an instant meal. With a day of appointments ahead of you all you have to do is throw the jar or two of beans and seasoning in the crockpot add a few jars of water a can of timatoes and go. Come home to a great aroma and good flavor. This is a magic recipe. For one thing I always heard you cannot put salt in beans before they are cooked but this has salt & bouillon but it works. The taste is great- good by itself but not overpowering if you want to flavor it differently.",
