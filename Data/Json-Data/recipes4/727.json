(I used Tony Charachere's - a staple here in south Louisiana.)  I added to the original recipe 1/2 can tomato paste, about l cup of chicken broth, and one can of Rotel tomatoes.  I used 3 stalks of celery, 4 whole cloves of garlic plus 3 cloves minced, 3 fresh jalapena peppers, seeded and chopped.  Instead of a four ounce can of mushrooms, I used a package of sliced, fresh mushrooms.  I cooked it on low for six hours, then switched it to high for two more.  I served it over rice.  In fact, I used a brand new kind of rice (new to me) I found at the grocery this morning:  a blend of texmati white, brown, wild and red rice made by Royal Blend.  I don't know how much it added to the recipe, but we sure liked it.",

                "reviewBody": "As a native New Orleanian I just couldn't make this without fixing it so that it would be more like Creole and not just chicken in tomato sauce, so I added some ingredients that are in a classic Creole sauce, (well ignoring that it's not shrimp, but chicken).  I cut up the chicken into small pieces, used 28oz of crushed tomato in a can instead of the stewed tomatos, added 1/4 - 1/2 c dry white wine, abt. 5 dashes of worcestershire sauce, abt. 8-10 dashes of hot sauce, and a pat of butter.  I omitted the mushrooms, and jalapenos, (not Creole).  It's still not a true Creole sauce, but it's decent to put over rice and serve to the family or close friends as long as I don't claim it's Creole.  BTW a true Creole sauce takes a million ingredients and half of your day, Creole is the fancy New Orleans style of cooking and almost always has some kind of sauce.  Cajun cooking is more country fare and can usually be made in one or two pots.  Cajun cooks had a farm or a boat to tend to and didn't have time for fancy dishes, unlike the wealthier people in the city.",

I'm sure it would be wonderful with it. It was juicy and had a kick to it. I took the broth and put it in a pan and reduced it a bit then added flour to make a roux. Last minute addition was 1/2 lb kielbasa I heated then added to the mix (just an afterthought) served this with \"Cuban beans and rice\" found on here. it was excellent! I'm sure there will be no complain of it being bland!",
