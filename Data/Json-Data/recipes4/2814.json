For me that meant not measuring and just relying on what looked right to me - less butter less corn (made it easier for Hubs to pick out and push aside given his sensitive innards) and more olives. For a recipe scaled to three servings I was to add just two olives so I wasn't overdoing it when I added more than that! I did use the amount of Cajun seasoning called for and I found I actually could have used more (Slap Ya Mama Cajun Seasoning). Hubs is not a big fan of zucchini but he did enjoy this - nothing wrong with straight zucchini as far as I'm concerned but the embellishment beyond the plain and simple made the difference for him. It looks kind of pretty too colorful and inviting.",

I made a spaghetti and meatball dinner for myself and decided that this as a side dish would be great since I had all the ingredients. I was too lazy to saute so I sliced the zucchini and the red onions and chopped the garlic and everything else and layered it into a glass baking dish and drizzled it with a little olive oil and dotted it with 2 tbs. of butter. (I used frozen corn by the way). I didn't feel like getting my Cajun seasoning so I just sprinkled it with a little salt and pepper. I covered the dish with parchment paper and sealed it with tin foil. This smelled so wonderful baking in a 375 degree oven for 40 minutes. The taste was even better it was great with my meatballs and spaghetti! I was never a big fan of zucchini but I will be making this dish often. The lazy girl that I am will always bake it!",
