It can also be used to give a little zing to your everyday cooking.\r\nThe amounts in this recipe are given by volume.

And I still threw in a bit more (1/2 tsp?)cayenne to give it some kick.  Boy was it good!  Family gobbled it up with some french bread. Everyone is asking for the leftovers, but they are all gone!

I might microwave instead of boil it next time though. 2nd cut the water significantly. I used 8 cups. 3rd I added a lot (?1/8 cup?) of Old Bay seasoning some paprika and 2T Emeril's seasoning (not much) for more taste. 4th to reduce cost I substituted 1# chicken breast (boneless/ skinless) for 1 of the #'s of shrimp. I seasoned the chicken with Old Bay and black pepper set it aside and then quickly browned it in a non-stick pan before adding it at the same time as the shrimp. Served it to friends and they loved it! Also not sure about the serving size-calories in the nutrition info. This made a lot more than 6 servings and I was going by 2 cups/person. I calculated it out at about 215 cal & 5g fat/ 2 cup serving.",

So...I substituted a bag of Trader Joe's frozen pre-cooked shrimp (about 3) for the 2 lbs of fresh; I used a red pepper from my garden in lieu of the green; and I added two chopped-up pregrilled chicken breasts. I also reduced the water to 8 cups as suggested by previous reviewers. I sauteed the okra for half an hour dumped the rest of the ingredients in the pot and set it to simmer...and then ran out to do errands for an hour and a half. I came back spiced/salted the gumbo and dished it out. The recipe turned out well; surely it would be best with the freshest raw ingredients but given my restrictions the soup turned out far better than canned gumbo and cheaper than the more purist version. Highly recommended.",

After some adjustments I would absolutley give this a 5 star. 1. Cooking the okra for 30 mins is way too long - by the time the dish is finished the okra is mush. 2. I added - 2 1/2 tbls Old Bay 1 tsp basil 1 tsp oregano 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper 2 tsp salt 1 tsp pepper 3. Reduced the water to 6 cups 4. 2 tbls tomato paste 5. Next time I will add more tomatoes With the added spices and reduced water this was a AMAZING! I served over rice. This was enough for me and my husband to have for dinner and both take left overs for lunch the next day.",
