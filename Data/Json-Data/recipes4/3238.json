I really appreciated the time guide line so I knew how long to put it in for for the amount of meat I had. But I must admit some parts (the darker meat) were tender but the whiter portions were cooked but not fall off the bone tender as with the slow cooker. It was still okay (especially since it was done in 40 min.) but texture wise I'd go with the slow cooker if I had to do it again. But again if under a time constraint it's not a bad option.",

It came out great - our guests even commented on how this was as good as the best slow cooker pork but they have ever had.  \n\nI did change the recipe up a bit.  First, I used a 4lb pork butt, and started by coating it with a traditional dryrub.  I then put the butt onto a foil lined pan (fat cap side up) and cooked at 450 for 45 minutes.  This nicely browned the meat!\n\nInstead of just using water to submerge the meat, I used approximately 70% filtered water & 25% apple juice, & 5% Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce.   \n\nThis was my first time ever using a pressure cooker and I am very pleased with this dish overall.",
