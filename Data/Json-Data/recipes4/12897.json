It's great as an appetizer or even as finger food at a football watching party! I also use it for just plain old regular steaks to grill! Either way, it's awesome! My uncle came up with the recipe and gave it to my mother, who passed it on to me! LOVE it!",

I should've noted that they can be a bit salty, so when I make them I usually get reduced-sodium soy sauce if I can. I also should've mentioned that the recipe works just as well with other cuts of beef and is even great for chicken and pork! My hubby and my 2-year-old son like it when I use this marinade to make pork chops in the slow-cooker! Anyway, makes me VERY happy to see everyone enjoying a family favorite of mine!",

The marinade went all thru out the steak and made them so flavorful and juicy!  Next time Im going to add some crushed garlic and brown sugar to the marinade to sweeten it up.  Like another reviewer said, this almost tastes like a menu item that a popular restaurant used to serve (fridays).  I think if you add the brown sugar to make it sweet it will taste just like it!  Great recipe, this is a favorite!",

I only marinated for 4 hours as I was short on time.  I placed the skewers on the grill for a few minutes on each side.  They were very tender and juicy, couldn't have tasted any better.  This is a definite 5 star recipe that I would highly recommend.  Thank you Dominique Lynne for sharing.",

That it is too salty is not because the soya sauce is too salty, but rather because it is too dominant. add sherry or saki (at least 2 T, up to 1/4 C, experiment). As suggested, add brown sugar (1 or 2 T) but then cut out the molasses. You will achieve a fuller flavor if you press or finely chop real garlic and fresh ginger (ground/powder is a very poor substitute).",
