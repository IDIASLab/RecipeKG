With a pasta roller and a ravioli mold, it didn't even take that long.  The only thing I added was I blended some spinach to the egg before adding to the flour, which gave the ravioli's a really nice gren color.  Next time (and there will definitely be a next time), I think I'll cut back on the cayenne pepper, so I can enjoy the flavor of the filling more.  Anyway, kudos on a great recipe!",

The Pasta dough is very easy to make and i am first timer to pasta dough however if you are rolling it out by hand i would recommend a pasta roller i am a little sore from it but well worth the effort if you have the time. Also it is totally possible to roll it to 1/16in and thinner. you just need space patience and flour.:-) The filling is amazing. I used fresh spinach that i cooked with the mushrooms and onions and ended up blending it all in my blender and if you don't have time to wait for the cream cheese to softened then it really helps or a food processor. My only issue was with cutting the dough with a cookie cutter i did not like that and ended up eyeballing it with a pizza cutter. I think i might get a pastry bag when i do this again to fill it faster. Took me a little over three hours to make this and there was enough for 6 with a few leftover. Oh as i was pressed for time at the end i did dumped some spaghetti sauce over it and ran out the door and it was still really great. I didn't use any extra salt or pepper as i forgot that step and the filling was great without the added salt but i would have preferred a little red pepper if i remembered. As someone else stated this is a very forgiving recipe.",
