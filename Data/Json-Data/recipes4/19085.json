During cooking (I used a pot instead of a pressure cooker) I added salt red peppers lots of extra lime zest and lime juice and cilantro (which was pictured but not included in the recipe). I also substituted the water for chicken bone stock. After all that it was delicious! Sometimes all you need are good bones and this recipe has good bones.",
