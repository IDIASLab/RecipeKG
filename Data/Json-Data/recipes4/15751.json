The apple and lemon flavors are most prominent accompanied by the subtle creamy undertones of the avocado. Consistency-wise this smoothie is slightly thicker than thin. If you like thicker smoothies add the optional ice. I did not and it is going down smooth. Makes about 4.5 cups of smoothie.",

However it is great nutrition so I will probably make this smoothie again with half a lemon next time. Also in spite of distinctly remembering picking out some parsley at the store I somehow didn't end up with it at home so I threw in a little fresh mint instead. I am sure the parsley would be good also but I did like the mint enough to use it again. Something else I did was put in the avocado pit and leave the lemon peel on. I am sure we all know the great nutritional benefits of avocados and lemons but did you know the avocado pit and the lemon peel actually are the parts of those fruits with the most nutrition? I know it sounds crazy to put the pit in and I am not sure if I would have dared to try it in my Ninja Pro (maybe the new Ninja Ultima could do it) but my new Vitamix didn't miss a beat. My drink was smooth and creaamy. By the way my dog begged for some too and to my surprise liked it--although he did seem a little puzzled by the tartness.",
