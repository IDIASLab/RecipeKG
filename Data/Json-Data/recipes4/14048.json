I'm a student and so I make this dish a lot simply because it barely takes any effort at all. I have many Marmite&reg; hater friends who absolutely despise the thought of Marmite&reg; and even they love it because once it is combined with the rice and other ingredients, it is extremely fragrant and it doesn't even taste strongly of Marmite&reg; at all! Adventurous food fanatics, I assure you that this is a winner!",
