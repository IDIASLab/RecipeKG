These are great and I have been looking for a good pumpkin scone recipe for awhile! I did add 1/4 cup brown sugar because I prefer sweet scones, and I added up the spice quantities (makes 1 T) and used pumpkin pie spice (also used pumpkin pie spice in the glaze). Baked at 425 as instructed and they were perfect at 16 minutes of baking. I only made one round that I cut into 8 pieces and I put them on parchment paper for baking. Absolutely delicious!",

While I've never checked if my oven is calibrated, most other recipes work fine at posted temps and times.  My husband and I prefer less-sweet scones, but if you want them sweeter, add 1/4 c sugar (I think brown would be better with the pumpkin, personally).  It is a healthier scone, so if you want something that tastes more like a junky pastry, this is probably not it!",

The spices used here start losing their potency as soon as they are opened and need to be restocked every 3-6 months if you buy the pre ground stuff.  I didn't think they were bland at all, but I always bake with fresh spices.\n\nI also agree with the reviewers who say this is more of a healthy recipe, and if you're looking for a junky sweet treat, this is not for you!  People who are health conscious will be more likely to like this recipe.",

My oven is correctly calibrated, but after 15 minutes the top was getting too dark and the insides were still too moist.  Drop the temperature and cook for a longer period of time.    The baking sheet should be lightly greased.  Not mentioned in recipe but they stuck and broke apart as i removed them.    Frosting needs more than 1 TBL of milk, more like 2 TBL. These are definately not like the famous coffehouse scones I had hoped for.",

Instead of milk, I used Caramel coffee creamer. My dough was a little dry so I added 2 extra Tbs of creamer.  I also added a small handful of mini chocolate chips. I used a cheese shredder  and shredded my cold butter into the flour mixture. It was easier thank using a pastry blender. I would like to try subbing some applesauce for the butter next time to see how they turn out to cut down on the fat. I just used a pastry brush and brushed a light  layer of glaze on top.  I would make these again.",
