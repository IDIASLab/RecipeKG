It's so simple that the only thing needed on my grocery list was ham hocks.  Be sure to purchase meaty ones, and don't add additional salt, it's plenty salty with the ham hocks.  The only change I made was to strain the soup after cooking, chill the liquid, skim off the fat then add the liquid back to the rest of the ingredients.  My husband loved it and that's the clincher.",

I did not have dried beans so I used a can of white beans, a can of black beans and a can of red kidney beans. I rinsed them thoroughly as I did not want to add any extra salt. No \"real\" garlic on hand, so used lots of garlic powder. Threw everything in slow cooker with 6 cups of water and dissolved chicken bouillon in the remaining 2 cups of water. Cooked on high for 8-9 hrs. Fabulous!  Everyone raved about it, will definitely make again.",
