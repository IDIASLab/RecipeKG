Patricia doesn't understand the name of this website is called \"ALLrecipes\" so I hope this clarifies her confusion. You can very easy switch to the scratch version in your head (chicken breasts cut into strips and coated in dry bread crumbs vs store prepped, real potatoes peeled, boiled and mashed vs store prepped, etc) but this recipe is good for those who don't have more time. I wouldn't give this 1 Star like Patricia did, that is plain rude. It's tasty, quick and easy. That's what counts.",

First I used 6 chicken drumsticks, dipped them in egg, then flour and then italian seasoning, baked them for about 30 mins per side at 375. I then shredded the chicken up and mixed it into about 8 cups of premade mashed potatoes from the night before, I then made up 2 packs of instant brown gravy dumped that in, cooked about 4 cups of frozen corn mixed that in, and then 2 cups of cheddar and a handfull of bacon bits, stirred it all up on stove until the cheese was all melted and it was warmed up enough to eat. Delicious!",
