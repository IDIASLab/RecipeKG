I added  a  pound of fresh asparagus  to  2  cups of  frozen broccoli  {I had these 2  on hand.] Since I used half the amount of veggies, I cut the milk in half also. I always thicken with corn starch , I  used that instead of flour. Just add and stir about 1/2 cup corn starch into  a cup of cold milk and gradually add this to heated milk, then add to pan  of  browned veggies as directed... gradually , and continually stirring.\n We love garlic so , I used garlic salt for regular salt and I used fresh parmesan to mix with the cheddar. I also added to the amount of cheese. What can I say...we love cheese, next time I'll cut back on the cheese.",

I am not typically a cook who likes to use canned soups but for this casserole I'll go back to my regular recipe. This recipe was OK but lacked flavor of my regular casserole and I followed these instructions and ingredients to a T except for halving the ingredients. The left-overs did not improve flavors and in fact it was worse the next day. The bechemel which normally makes a great cheese sauce turned glutinous resulting in a very poor texture...particularly for the leftovers.",
