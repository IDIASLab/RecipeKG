I have always made pie crust with just lard, flour, salt and water, like my mom did, so I tried this one day.  The crust was a dream to roll out, but I was skeptical as to how much shrinkage there would be because the crust was so light and delicate.  Well, I decided to bake two pie shells to see what happens.  What happened was that I was pleasantly surprised.  Wonderful tender, flaky crust and not much shrinkage at all.  My guys said I outdid myself that week, so I guess this will become my crust of choice.  Sorry mom! Hint:  Shortening and butter are good for crusts, but lard can't be beat. And a little trick for those having tear problems.  When you get the dough rolled to the desired thickness, lay your rolling pin on the edge of the dough farthest from you.  Using a tender touch, roll the dough up over your rolling pin, then using your hands, not the handles, GENTLY roll the pin towards you rolling the dough over the pin.  Put your pie pan directly behind the dough covered pin, and using both hands lift the pin and dough onto your pan, then roll away from you.  Your dough will go into your pan beautifully, and your top crust will set perfectly.",
