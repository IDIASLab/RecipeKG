I followed the recipe adding a few things-a diced zucchini, 4 cloves garlic instead of one, 1 can (14 1/2 ounces) of stewed Italian seasoned tomatoes, chopped ,in addition to the crushed tomatoes (the ones i had weren't Italian-style), 1/4 cup dry red wine, 2 teaspoons sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes. Followed the directions and served it over thin spaghetti with garlic bread. Thank you so much for sharing! I will make this again and the bonus is that it is healthy and very low in fat, but it doesn't taste like it Yum! Also, I think olive oil should be used instead of vegetable, the olive oil gives it a wonderful flavor! Eating the leftovers and they are fantastic!",

First, I browned the chicken in a pan with lots of onions, garlic and green pepper. Once ready, I transferred to the crockpot with the remaining ingredients and cooked on low for probably 4 hours. I didn't have any mushrooms, I didn't cube the chicken and at the end I forgot to add Parmesan, but even then was very flavorful. Next time I will make sure to have everything. Served over whole wheat egg noodles with steamed broccoli and cauliflower.",

However I did follow another reviewers recommendation and floured the chicken before browning added a 14 1/2 oz can of diced tomatoes in addition to the 28 oz crushed tomatoes used red pepper instead of green used 4 cloves of garlic and sauteed sliced mushrooms and diced zucchini. When I turned it down to simmer I added 1/4 cup dry red wine a packet of Splenda and a pinch of red pepper flakes. THAT made it 5 star awesome!!!
