I use oil not butter and add 1 grated carrot. 2 tablespoons of curry powder or to taste (most important ingredient) I also cook it differently. Soften onion. Add carrot celery curry powder and meat and cook until meat browned. Add soup mix and 2 cups of water (or half the quantity specified on the soup packet). Simmer for 15 mins. Add beans and very very very finely sliced cabbage. Stir well. Cook with lid on for about 5 -10 mins or until cabbage cooked as you like it. I serve it with steamed rice or noodles and it makes oodles! The curry powder really makes it.",
