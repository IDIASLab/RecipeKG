My only suggestion would be to dredge, dunk and coat all the shrimp first then let sit on a wire rack or parchment paper while the oil comes up to temp. This does two things. 1) it allows the coating to become set. 2) it greatly facilitates the deep frying process so the oil is not sitting and breaking down while you prepare subsequent batches.",

                "reviewBody": "Great fried shrimp. The key is the panko. It's texture allows it to fry up golden brown and crunchy before the protein it's stuck to (in this case, shrimp) gets overcooked. Some tips: You could probably use 1/2 the flour mixture. Add the seasoned shrimp to the flour, stir to coat, and then gently shake them out over the garbage can in a wire strainer to remove the excess flour. Make sure the shrimp are very dry when you do this or they'll be gummy. Have a big plate or baking sheet covered with wax paper ready to place the shrimp on after you've coated them all with the egg wash and panko. Then, it's off to the fryer. Makes for an easier cleanup, and you don't have to juggle making them/frying them simultaneously. Panko is very coarse so you may have to help it stick by pressing it on.",

Do not try and skip this step by mixing in flour it makes a big difference in shrimp taste.  Shake excess flour off and let sit a few to ensure it is dry.  Then dip in egg and panko again let it sit 5 to 10 min before frying this help secure the batter to the shrimp and it fry's so nice.  You can do the same to pork, beef or chicken make sure you put the meat between a sheet of wax paper or plastic bag and flatten with mallet.",
