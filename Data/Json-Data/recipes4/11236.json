A few substitutions can be made to make this dish more authentic to our country, but all in all it is a good recipe. Tomatoes, ketchup and celery can be added, but for the most part they aren't included. An ingredient that is normally included but wasn't listed here is diced green bell pepper. Try adding maybe a half of a pepper or a whole one if you really like it. Also, instead of using fresh thyme, we'd normally let it dry out before cooking with it for a stronger flavor. Pigeon or black-eye peas can also be substituted for canned kidney beans if you can't find either, although we'd call that 'Bean 'n Rice' instead :-) Now all you need is some baked macaroni with your favorite meat or fish and you're all set!",

(you can freeze the rest) No ketchup or tomatos has ever been added. Be careful with the Thyme it is a strong herb. Black eyed peas is another name for the pea.",

He then added the chopped onion and garlic. After the onions were cooked about one or two minutes he stirred in a can of tomato paste no tomatoes. about a cup of washed white long grained rice then enough water to just cover the rice. He set the heat on low and just let the rice cook slowly until all liquid was absorbed. He then fluffed the rice adding the peas at the end. He flavored it also with salt (did not need much) and thyme. This is a good recipe.",

I will be making this again. P.S. I don't know what the person who said that the tomato paste simmered to the top. You must have done something wrong because this turned out nicely cooked and fluffy.
