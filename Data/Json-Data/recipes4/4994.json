What I did was: I made a mixture of flour (about a cup) and rosemary (a Tablespoon or so) and rolled the cubes of meat in it before I started to cook them. Then instead of shortening I used butter as I had no shortening on hand. I also added more onion used 6 or 7 regular carrots that I cut up instead of the baby carrots and cut the potatoes a bit smaller than called for. Other than those (minor) changes I followed the recipe to a \"Tee\". It was great but next time I might try using more vegetables: maybe some chopped up tomatoes and peas to make it a little heartier. A great base for a beef stew though!:)",

We wanted to experiment with the cooking technique which resulted in slightly over-cooked beef which was our own fault however we both agreed the flavors of the \"broth\" were delicious as well as the veggies. The only other thing we did differently was add a little cornstarch to thicken it up a bit but that's just our personal taste. We will definitely make this again but next time we are going to slow cook it and see how that comes out. Over-all a good simple recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "This was fantastic.  I cooked it in the crockpot.  For the first half (meat, broth, onions, etc), I cooked on low for about 4 hrs. Then I chopped up veggies and cooked them in butter in a skillet until about half cooked and then added them to the crockpot (turned it up to high). The only thing different is that I added peas and mushrooms.  I also added several spices to bump up the flavor a bit at the end. I didn't add salt earlier because the broth has a lot in it and I wanted to wait to see if it needed more. The spices I added later were: salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, a little cayenne, celery seed, oregano & basil.  Finally, I thickened the broth a bit by putting flour and water in a jar with a lid, shaking vigorously until there were no lumps and then putting into broth.  I let it simmer several minutes until the flour cooked.  It was great and I will make it again.",
