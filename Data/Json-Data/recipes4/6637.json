This comes close. I julienned the veggies - how the restaurant served it - and used only carrots a yellow squash two green zucchini a sweet onion and sliced up some baby bella shrooms. Plopped them on a baking sheet added maybe two tbls of olive oil a decent sprinkling of the herbs salt and fresh ground pepper. Roasted at 400 for 25 mins stirring twice. My mistake - using a cheap store-brand parmesan that I'd freshly grated for the sauce. Big mistake as the sharp cheap flavor was just awful and pretty much ruined what could've been a deliciously delicate yet complex finished dish. Next time I'll use better parmesan and actually leave it out of the sauce altogether putting it on to taste when serving. I'll also probably double the sauce as the veggies soaked up a lot of it. Oh and I may also use less butter and light cream next time. Liked this recipe a lot sorry for the changes. It's a great start for the recipe I'm looking to replicate.",

I did not double the butter or cheese though just because I felt like 6 tablespoons of butter would have been a bit much. It came out very tasty even with the slight tweaks. This is a good one for kiddos because the sauce is very mild. Next time I'll probably add some crushed red pepper just to give it a little bit of a kick.",
