The suggested \"kick\" needed is not the perfect dressing, but is, instead, the perfect blend of spices-- garlic and a little cayenne pepper or diced jalapeno. For those who wish to marinate more then 15 minutes, wait to add the avocado until just before serving, otherwise it gets soggy. And if you want to marinate overnight, there is no need to cook the shrimp at all, as the lime juice will do so.   I sauteed the shrimp lightly with olive oil and a bit of Cajun spices, then added all the ingredients plus garlic, cayenne pepper and a bit of red onion.  Then I marinated it for an hour. My husband and I spent a year in Baja MX and Central America and we ate all versions of this dish, so we have tasted it all! He had two helpings and finished his plate. This version is a keeper! ",

I used a yellow bell pepper for color I think red would go well too. Use the lime juice like the recipe calls for and let it set in the refrigerator for more than 15 minutes (I left it overnight). Allows the flavors to blend. Everyone in my wine class loved it. I can't wait to try it again with home-grown tomatoes next summer.",

I went to the store & got home & realized that I did not have all the veggies that I needed so I improvised. 1st I boiled the shrimps w/old bay & onion & garlic. I thinly sliced the onions cubed the avocado & cut the shrimp into bite size pieces. I then squirted fresh lime juice over the top. I let it set for about 15 mins the kids could not wait to eat it. It was a HIT!!! Everyone loved it even the hubby!! I cut my avocado too small so it kind of made it like a dressing because it was all smashed. Next time if I make it for a group I will keep the avocado pieces bigger. This dish was even better a few hours later!! My hubby said to add cucumbers next time. Next time I'll try and add the tomatoes. Mine are still green in the garden.",
