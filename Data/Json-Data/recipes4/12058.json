A few things I used to see my mother do different was to add the whole egg instead of egg white (ball will hold better) and add about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of rice to your meat before forming into a ball.  One more thing, to add more flavoring, add 1 or 2 jalapeno peppers and some chicken bullion to the broth while cooking.  Hope this helps. :)",

The only problem is the recipe doesn't state how much water and how much mint so I guessed at 2 c water and I used almost all the mint that came in the container except the 2 tbs set aside for the meatballs. Turned out fine. I added cabbage potatoes and corn to the soup and it was so delicious.",
