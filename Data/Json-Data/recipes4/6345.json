Ingredients: Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce, low sodium Worcestershire Sauce, unsalted butter and arrowroot\n2.  Cook time in slow cooker: 1 hr on high, 1 hr on low\n3. After cooking complete: use slotted spoon to remove wings from slow cooker. Drain the sauce off the wings\n4.  Baking pans: lined with parchment paper (easy clean-up)\n5. Cook time in oven: @400 for 30 minutes, turning after 15 minutes. Watch closely or you will burn them at this temp but worth it. The are wonderfully crispy!\n6. Dipping Sauce: simmer juices from slow cooker thickened with arrowroot in sauce pan on stove\n\nResults: Fantastic!!  This is the keeper recipe for wings. We like our wings extra crispy but juicy on the inside and this recipe delivers, with the above listed modifications. Family members said, no need to eat wings out anymore. Next time we are going to add garlic and grated parmesan to the cooking sauce.  This is so easy.",

My husband was sweating while devouring these on Sunday. \n\nLike others said reduce crock pot cooking time because the wings fall off the bone. To keep a crisp wing I pulled them out after 3 hrs on high then broiled them for 5 minutes on both sides to get a crisp wing. Mmmmm delicious!! \n\nThanks for sharing",

I use 1 cup orange juice or 1 can (12 oz) Guava juice 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of honey (you my substitute maple syrup). Just mix together and pour over the wings after they have cooked on high in the slow cooker for one hour. Then finish cooking on low for an additional 4 hours. Wings will not be crispy. If you want crispy wing put on a cookie sheet and bake 350 degrees for about 20 minutes or until desired crispness.",
