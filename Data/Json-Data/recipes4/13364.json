I didn't bother with the whole metal baking dish thing.  I just cut the cabbage into wedges and removed the core. I cut pieces of foil big enough for each wedge then sprayed the foil with Pam so nothing would stick.  I seasoned each wedge with a bit of salt, pepper, and minced garlic.  I put a bat of butter inside and wrapped them up.  Delicious - I'll definitely make these again.",
