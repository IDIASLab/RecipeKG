I browned the meat/pepper/onion first and put it on top of the chopped veges in the s/c pot. I used beef stock instead of soup mix. I also omitted the pasta because (a) there was no room and (b) pasta doesn't really work in a slow cooker soup unless you add it near the end. It was scrumptious and I will definitely make it again probably reducing the amount so I can use the right proportion of ingredients.",

I freeze my garden tomatoes and zucchini in the Fall when I have an abundance and enjoy their fresh taste all Winter long with this recipe. We add two cans of tomatoe sauce to make the broth creamier and a can a sliced mushrooms. When we serve the soup we sprinkle grated cheese over the top and have homemade bread. I have also made this soup using shredded leftover roast beef instead of hamburger. I would highly recommend this soup to anyyone!! So simple and so good.",

But overall I pretty much kept the recipe the same (except for the meat substitution) and my boyfriend and I were very pleased. Oh and I didn't take one other person's suggestion and added freshly grated parmesan cheese on top after dishing each bowl.....because that's yummy too.",

Never added any salt and it did not need any. Added some fresh sliced mushrooms close to the end of the cooking time and they went well in this. I used cavatappi for the pasta and it took too long to cook. By the time it was soft the zucchini was almost overdone. Next time I would add the pasta a bit before the zucchini even if I use elbow macs. Sprinkled on Parmesan just before serving. Very yummy.",

I was afraid of it being too tomato-y tasting but it's not so! Not sure 4 c. of water is enough- there wasn't much liquid during and after cooking. I couldn't tell when the soup started to boil because there was just so much vegetable in the pot. This is a REALLY HEARTY STEW. I only added 1 lb of g. turkey 3 lbs of macaroni. The dang soup wouldn't boil even after quite some time on high so I just threw in the cooked turkey and macaroni and simmered and stirred till the noodles were cooked and onions softened..",
