I don't have or use half and half because I'm lactose intolerant; instead I used skim milk (the only milk I can stomach) and it was fine dried basil bc I have no fresh and left out the sausage. Unlike others I didn't modify the flour amount but did add a cup more chicken broth (my cans have two cups and I didn't want to deal with half a can) and left out the sausage. I think it would be good with sausage but I don't think it's necessary. This soup has a lot going on already and is rich enough we didn't miss the meat. Very good with bread or grilled cheese as we had it with. Thanks for the recipe!",
