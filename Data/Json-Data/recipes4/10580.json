I worked at OG for a long time and the kale is added when the pan is refilled and served immediately.  The longer it sits, the more the kale softens up, but most days it doesn't get to sit for very long.  Next time I will add more potatoes and try to figure out how to thicken it just a bit more, maybe whisk a little cornstarch into the broth before adding other ingredients.  Oh yeah, I tripled this recipe and used 2 packages of ground sausage, 1 lb. each, and I used all chicken broth, taste was wonderful!!!",

Instead of using vegetable oil to cook the onions in, use 2 strips of bacon cut up in small pieces. I used 2 large cloves of garlic and 3 potatoes. I removed the sausage from its casing, broke it up and browned in skillet. I then drained it and added 1/2 cup flour to the sausage and mixed it up until the flour is invisible. I used chicken broth instead of the base and water and I added 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper. Amazing!!",
