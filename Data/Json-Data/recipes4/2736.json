I eliminated the worcester sauce I don't know what kind you use but the kind I use is Lea and Perrins and it s sweet and does not compliment the flavor. I also used a sharper cheese for more cheese flavor and left out parmesan cheese as well as adding more of the mustard powder which enhances the cheddar flavor and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give a little zing. I also like toasted garlic and butter crumb topping. My family just loves it including my extended family. I love to bring this to family reunions its the first to go.",
