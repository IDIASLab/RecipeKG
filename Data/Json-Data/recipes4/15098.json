I used what I had on hand and followed the recipe but used a few lighter ingredients (2% milk half the butter etc). I sauteed and browned the chicken and took a tip from another reviewer and added chopped portobella mushrooms because I had one that needed to be used up. The original poster omitted the garlic due to an allergy so I sauteed a couple of chopped cloves of garlic with the mushrooms. I had fresh Italian herbs in the garden so I added those (finely chopped) toward the end and served it with some freshly ground pepper. I felt it needed more than just salt as a seasoning. It probably didn't get quite as thick it would using the heavy whipping cream but my family was happy to sop it it up with bread (next time I'll use a little cornstarch as a thickener). Even lightened up this one is a keeper.",

I used baby kale so I didn't have to mess with de-stemming (and I had it); 2% milk and some cornstarch (didn't have heavy whipping cream); a blend of Parmesan asiago and Romano cheeses (what I had - sensing a theme? LOL!); minced garlic; more salt and pepper; served over/mixed with rigatoni; and garnished with a bit of basil and shaved Parmesan (not necessary but I love garnishes). If you don't have or like kale spinach would be a perfectly wonderful substitute. I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again and again! Thank you!",
