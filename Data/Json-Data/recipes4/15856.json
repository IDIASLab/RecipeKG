It was certainly quick to prepare and used pantry staples but it just had a bit of an off taste to me kind of like Pasta-Roni. So if you're a fan of products like Pasta-Roni you'll love this (and that's not a slam at all just something to give you an idea of what to expect). Otherwise this probably isn't for you. THANKS for the recipe Amy R!",
