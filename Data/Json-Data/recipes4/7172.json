Slight alteration - I season chicken and let it sit for an hour or so in fridge, then I shake the chicken in flour and use avocado oil to fry (healthy fat and great for frying since it's perfect for really high temperatures). After chicken is fried I brush with olive oil, lemon pepper seasoning and lemon juice mixture. Better than Wing Stops and way more healthy!!!",
