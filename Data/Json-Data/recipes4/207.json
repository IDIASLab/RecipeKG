Instead of using all the milk in the chocolate chips I ended up pouring some over the top to help the cookies and chocolate chips stay in place (like what you do when you make 7-layer bars). It made the top not quite as pretty (you could see the milky color over the chocolate) but the taste is DiViNe =) Rich and wonderful!",

Because these are so sweet and rich you can cut them small like fudge. I ended up with about 60 small cubes--perfect for a kids' Christmas party. I cooled them completely then chilled them for a few minutes and cut them with no trouble. (It's even easier to cut them if you wait till the next day.) Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!",

Instead of the semi-sweet chocolate chips I used the swirl chips with the white chocolate. This added a little color. Definately make sure this dessert cools before cutting into it. I actually made it the night before and let it sit in the fridge all night before cutting. Took it to a baby shower and everyone enjoyed. I will definately make this dessert again.",
