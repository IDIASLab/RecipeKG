The fresh blueberries really held their shape and give you a real pop of sweetness.  Be sure to mash your bananas well; I didn't, thinking they would break down when cooking, but they didn't.  It was a little thick, so I did thin out after I took the photo by adding some water to get the consistency we like.  I've tried a number of slow cooker oatmeal recipes, and this one actually might be my favorite.",

For example, instead of 2 cups fresh blueberries I substituted 2 cups mixed berries because I had a little bit of blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries. I also added more cinnamon because we love cinnamon.\n \nAs another reviewer suggested, it is prone to stick, so I added 1/2 cup more almond milk and 2T butter. It still stuck a little but not much.\n\nI had leftover and it rewarms well in the microwave.",

I used all plain almond milk instead of part water and omitted the honey since we needed to cut the sugar.  Since I used quicker-cooking steel cut oats, I was able to reduce the time quite a bit. I used frozen blueberries from our farm, and they held together surprisingly well.  This was great when reheated the next day.  Thanks for a very good recipe!",
