Regular butter or whole milk can be substituted. I use whipped butter and low-fat milk to reduce saturated fat. Fresh spinach may be used, although I recommend frozen, but will need to be boiled until tender, finely chopped, and dried very well. Double the sauce ingredients to make a slightly creamy texture. Recipe makes 2 regular or 3 small servings. Hope you like it.",

This is meant to be a quick homestyle spinach dish or the type you would eat with meatloaf or something similar. The spinach needs the stronger taste of the ground spices. It will be bland with fresh garlic. This is not an Italian garlic spinach or a fancy dish. I put it together for something quick for a weeknight or to get kids or husbands who don't normally eat spinach to learn to love it. Thanks!",

I thought it was really good. My son poked at it and whined about why I was messing with his spinach finally convinced him to try it and he loved it. He ended up eating 3 servings and scraped the bowl of the leftovers:) Love when that happens. Good thing I doubled the recipe! Will definitely be making this again.",

I enjoyed it because it has a subtle creamy flavor and texture with just enough seasoning that doesn't take away the taste of the spinach itself. Went very nice with the well seasoned grilled chicken we had and was good too because it didn't compete with the main entry it complimented it.  I know I'll make this often. Thanks Sarah!",
