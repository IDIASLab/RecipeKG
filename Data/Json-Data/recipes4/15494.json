I did have some trouble with the flowers but I think that was due to my misunderstanding of what to do with them. When I first read the recipe I read it as sticking the flowers up and out of the top of the soil. Yeah that doesn't work. As soon as you get a couple in the mold breaks up and crumbles into pieces. I won't go into what all I did to get them to stick up and out but rather tell you that I think the recipe submitter meant for you to just use the blooms and lay them on top of the dirt mound. That is what I recommend anyway. I think this would be a big hit with kids and with the exception of my flower mishap it was super simple.",
