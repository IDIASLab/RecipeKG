It's one of my favorite dishes to fix. And by the way you can use whatever parts of the chicken you wish the editor of this site is the one that put chicken breasts on there. I usually use leg quarters. But it depends on whose eating it as to what I use (some people prefer white meat to dark). You might could even venture to try other types of meat such as pork or beef. If anyone tries it and likes it please let me know. Happy eating!:)",

Talk about simple to put together (it took all of 10 minutes) and exceptional results! The aroma while baking in the oven was wonderful! I was a little leary of putting sliced potatoes in the dish, but when served they were a nice compliment and I wouldn't skip adding them! The chicken was noticeably tender and cut with a fork - not sure if it was just fresh chicken or the pineapple juice which made the difference. I'm so glad I tried this recipe! YOU SHOULD TOO! You won't be disappointed! Nice presentation! I did used diced pineapple instead of sliced and put them on top of the chicken rather than on the side with the potatoes. I used Bulls-Eye Honey Mustard BBQ sauce. My husband couldn't stop complimenting this dish! Thanks ladies for a tasty recipe!",

I add a bit of soy sauce Worcestershire and white vinegar to the sauce and reduced the pineapple juice. I add the vegetables only for the last 15 minutes of baking because they could indeed be soggy and overcooked if they sat in the sauce for the whole hour. Oh and I marinate the chicken in the sauce for 24 hours before cooking. In any case my family and friends and I LOVE this recipe! It's easy and delicious; I highly recommend it!",

I prepared white rice as a side dish and it was a great compliment. I will make this again but next time I will use less pineapple juice. I would have liked the sauce left in the pan to be thicker.
