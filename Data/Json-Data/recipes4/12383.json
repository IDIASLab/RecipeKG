Then you can ignore the tongue and get to the joy of this dish. I did not use Jalapeno tomato or the cayenne. I think this is more of a Cuban style black bean dish and I prefer the Brazilian style. I like the recipe that does not use beef or Jalapenos. It is always fun to try new recipes I just had a hard time going from my fantasy Brazilian black bean to this style. I like this dish I won't make it again because I love the pork style better.",
