The only thing that I did not like was that there were no seasoning proportions given.  I was an unexperienced chili maker when I found this recipe, so had to find my own seasoning.  I usually use about 2 Tbsp. chili powder, 1 Tbsp cumin, 1/2 tsp garlic powder (or 3-4 cloves in step 3), and salt and pepper to taste (this varies depending on if I used fresh or canned ingredients).  My non-vegan hubbie loved this recipe, and it always disappears at potlucks, especially when accompanied with sour cream on top, and fresh cornbread on the side (see my recipe, Nan's Yankee Cornbread).",

I used a can of red kidney beans, a can of white beans, and cooked the lentils (they cook fast) instead of soaking overnight.  I used a can of green beans instead of making fresh, and used canned diced tomato.  So I eliminated steps 1 & 2.   I followed the rest of the ingredients, and added some fresh garlic for extra taste.   Then I realized that I did not have time to cook it on the stove, since I had to take my daughter to swim class.  So instead of simmering on the stove, I threw all of the ingredients into the crock-pot, and set it on \"low\".  When I got home 2.5 hours later, it was perfectly done.  And very tasty too, thanks for the healthy, yummy recipe!",

So I used canned beans and didn't soak the lentils (just cooked them for about 30 minutes).  I threw everything together in a crock pot and left on low for about 4 hours.  I didn't add water because there was no room in the pot!  This turned out amazing!  The flavors were perfect together and I actually prefer it to regular chili!  Huge hit with my boyfriend as well!  Made a double batch to freeze individual portions for later.  Thanks for a great recipe!\nOh, the one main modification I made was a large can of stewed tomatoes rather than fresh.  If I have time next time I will try with fresh!",
