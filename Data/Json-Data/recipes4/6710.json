The amount of butter could be scaled back just a little because there was still some left in the bowl when my bread cubes were plenty saturated. Next time I think I would use half garlic powder and half garlic salt because these were just a little salty for us. I had to remove the bowl of baked croutons from in front of my family for sampling or we would not have had any left for our salad! Yum!",

Did not add salt as butter is salted and we don't need the extra sodium. After spreading on pan sprinkled Parmesan /herb mix from Papa Murphys on it. Baked 300 and turned every few minutes until crispy. Will never use store bought again. My grandchildren loved these as snacks. Which is better than candy!",
