I used fresh spinach like some other reviewers. I melted the butter and started the spinach first in the skillet. When it had wilted a bit I added the onions, garlic, etc. Also I didn't have evaporated milk so I used regular milk. It was not a problem. I used both mahi mahi and tilapia. The mahi mahi tasted the best in this dish.",

I didn't end up broiling it b/c I didn't want to overcook the fish so I just ended up adding the parmesan when I did the jack cheese.  I used fresh spinach so I sauteed it off in a separate pan then added it when needed.  Yummy recipe..thanks!!!!",
