So, since I've found that I actually like it, I've been trying to find different ways to use it, and this recipe is great and so easy!  Like the other reviewer, next time, I think I will put some more seasoning in the mix, but the consistency was just right and they have that real \"comfort food\" taste.  They are great dipped in ranch or hot sauce. Yummy.",
