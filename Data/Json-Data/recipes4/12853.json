That was the only change I made. I'm not much of a tea drinker, I leave that to my husband, but this one I really liked. REALLY liked. I think I could cut back the sugar just a touch but that's all a matter of taste. I think this might be a new summer favorite. I plan on spiking mine tonight with a little vodka for an adult cocktail. ;)",

I blended the peach with water for about 3 min to make sure that it was blended complutely with no chunks or anything. I also dont like to boil water for tea as I think that it just burns the tea and makes it bitter so I just use my tap water at its hottest point. I make 3 quarts of tea with 2 peaches. and I use 1/4 cup of sugar and it is plenty sweet for my family. Remember that when you put sugar on fruit it brings out the fruits sweetness so when you add sugar it will get even sweeter as it sits Becuase it is bringing out the sweetness of the peaches.",
