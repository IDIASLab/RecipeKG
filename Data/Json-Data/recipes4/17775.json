I had never thought of mixing a decadent coconut curry with a delicious avocado. After all, delicious fat plus more delicious fat is always a win. So I ordered it, made mental notes along the way and whipped up a batch the very next day. One tweaking batch later, and I've arrived at this. Serve over rice or noodles.",
