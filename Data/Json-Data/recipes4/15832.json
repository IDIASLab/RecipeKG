It's not needed, all the ingredients are so full of flavour on their own. I made this as written in the evening to have it ready for a quick lunch the next day. I mixed up the dressing while the lentils were cooking to let it set. I ended up adding a bit of fresh, diced red bell pepper and shredded carrot for color, crunch and taste then mixed in the dressing. It was so full of flavour and crunch at lunch the next day I mixed up another salad with leftover lentils for company and they took all the leftovers home! So make a triple portion of this if you've got company! A perfect recipe, simple as is but allows you to use your imagination, preferences and ingredients as you like. Don't be weary of mixing balsamic vinegar and white vinegar, they are a match made in heaven.",
