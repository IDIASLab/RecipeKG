I used 16oz of Medium salsa (that brand that's NOT made in New York City) which is pretty hot in its own right only 3 of the chipotle peppers in adobo the can of chilis & the lime. Once cooked all we could really taste was HOT. I drained most of the juice (as that's where most of the heat was) then added a little mild salsa adobo seasoning and a dash of worcestershire and let it go for another hour or so. The result was quite tasty I have to admit and I think we'd do it again maybe use just the adobo sauce & pull out the peppers?",
