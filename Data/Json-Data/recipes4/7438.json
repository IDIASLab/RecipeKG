If I were to make these again I would cut the sriracha with tomato sauce or ketchup. UPDATE:  After rating this 3 stars, my spicy loving grand daughter disagreed.  She really liked these.  I used the leftover shrimp, cut in small pieces mixed in with Island Fried Rice and the combination was really good.",
