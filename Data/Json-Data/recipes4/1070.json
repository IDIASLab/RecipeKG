These were my changes: I seasoned the eggplant with salt, pepper, and granulated garlic.  I topped with the onions, then parmesan cheese.  This was topped with tomato, then cheese.  I didn't have enough tomato for all the eggplant slices, and in tasting the finished product, the tomato slices were a WORLD better than the ones with no tomato.  Also, I only had processed cheese slices; they were creamy, but I think a nice sharp cheddar would have been better.  This will be a great summer staple!",
