I don't know if it would be possible to use 2 POUNDS (approx. 8 cups) of flour 4 riced potatoes only 1 cup of water and get this to work? I used considerably less flour (about 4 3/4 cups or 21.4 ounces). I drained off 2/3 cup tomato juice before putting the crushed tomatoes on the focaccia. I would recommend slightly less salt. The recipe says to let this cool to room temperature before cutting and serving but it is much better warm. There could be an improvement upon using plain cold crushed canned tomatoes as the topping...maybe simmer the crushed tomatoes with garlic and/or onion before adding the oregano. The crust turned out crisp on the outside and chewy inside but there are simpler & tastier recipes that get the same result.",
