I placed the fish and marinade in a casserole dish, let it sit in the fridge 20 mins, then put the casserole dish in the over and baked it for 20 mins at 400. It's good pan-fried too, but baking it cooks it evenly so it stays juicy and really soaks up the marinade. Also I find the oil spits and makes a huge mess when made in the pan. Delish and no mess after!",
