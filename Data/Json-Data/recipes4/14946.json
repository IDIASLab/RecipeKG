I imagine it was made with kitchen staples at the time so they had very little seasoning options. The difference in my recipe is that I make it with either bread crumbs or butter crackers or a combo of them salt pepper garlic & Worcestershire. Everything else is the same. Nothing fancy basic comfort food from grandma. I've tried other recipes but always come back to this.",

I've been looking for a low sugar meatloaf recipe (surprisingly hard to find) and now I have to look no further! Due to my husband's diet restrictions I substituted turkey for beef and used gluten free bread crumbs. Next time I think I'll double the recipe for more leftovers. Oh and bonus- my 17 month old ate his entire serving. I could see a little bit of sage being a really good addition. Thank you Jason!",

It has a nice texture and I like the nutritional benefit of using a carrot and an apple. Except for the crumbs I followed the recipe and the method exactly. I think it would also benefit from some kind of topping or sauce. Unfortunately there aren't enough drippings to make a sauce so I will have to wing it.

It gets absorbed nicely into the the 1 C. of bread crumbs. I also add 1/2 green bell pepper and 1/2 tsp. dried basil. I like to use very lean ground beef in meatloaf; otherwise, it's greasy and difficult to slice. That said, a nice touch is to lay 2 or 3 slices of bacon across the top while baking for 75 minutes, uncovered. The bacon gives it a wonderful flavor! I bake mine in a loaf pan.",
