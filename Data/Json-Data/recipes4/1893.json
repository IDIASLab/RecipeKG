To the dry ingredients I added a teaspoon of sugar.  The result was addictive.  There wasn't a trace left.  I'm also going to try with lemon juice.",

But - I needed to create an account and rate this recipe!  I don't know that I woud call it New Orleans Barbeque Shrimp, but more like a spicy shrip scampi.  It wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but I am glad that I ran into it.  This shrimp is great.  The spices and different flavors that you experience while eating this dish are phenominal, and somewhat rare for many home made dishes, but more what you would find in restaurant prepared meals.  This is definitely worth making.  Only change - I used one stick of butter instead of two, and I still had plenty of sauce.  I imagine cutting the butter in half strengthened the flavor of the spices as well!  Great recipe!",

My only criticism is that in my mind all this butter is unnecessary and just goes to waste whether you serve this over pasta sop it up with bread or not. Other than that the seasonings all cooperate with each other into a nice flavor all its own - in other words the beer isn't obvious nor is the Worcestershire or any of the herbs or spices. I served this over a tossed green salad with a Lemon Dijon Vinaigrette. It was a light but satisfying full-flavored summer meal.",

First, the unsalted butter goes LAST not first because you do not want the butter to break down, you want it to stay nice and creamy for dipping your bread. You can use wine instead of beer. Also, add half a lemon, squeeze juices and then throw lemon  into pan. You simmer the shrimp (with heads on for extra flavor) in the liquids and spices (You can purchase Creole seasoning, we use Tony Chacheres and omit all the separate spices and salt) and let the liquid cook down and the shrimp turn nice and pink, Once the shrimp are pink and liquid cook down some, add the butter and stir just until melted then remove from heat. If the butter breaks, you can add some whipping cream. You can see this recipe demonstrated on YouTube. Just make sure you use UNSALTED butter or the dish will be too salty.",
