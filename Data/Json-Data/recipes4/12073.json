It was so easy, and so good, though a bit salty.  Next time, I will only use half of the onion soup mix, and low sodium soup.  I only had one dirty pan to clean, so to me, it was awesome this way. :)",

Both hubby and I didnt care for the recipe when I used the cream of chicken (didnt taste like salisbury steak). Added chopped onion to the mixture for added flavor and use ground SIRLOIN--it's the best. Also, Country Crock now makes mashed potatoes you can buy in the refridgerator isle of the grocery store, they are kind of expensive, but they are sooo good. Makes the meal even easier since you can microwave them! Goes great with the salisbury steak!",

I made mashed potatoes to go with this dinner - yum!  I used 1/2 of the dry onion/mushroom soup mix so it would not be too salty.  But it is MUCH BETTER with the CREAM OF CHICKEN then the Cream of Mushroom!!!  It may sound strange, but once you add the Dry Au Jus Mix to the Cream of Chicken, it turns it to a beef flavor, not chicken.  Instead of water I also added Chicken Broth.  Beef broth would make it too \"beefy\".  This gave it a very nice, smooth flavor.  I also added a Jar of Mushrooms (drained).  This is the 3rd time I've made it in a month!!  Very unusual for my household.  I also like it because it is so easy.  Don't over mix your beef mixture, that will make it tough.  If you handle with care, it will not fall apart.  I love it when I find recipes that are wonderful and cooked in slow cooker/crock pot.  =)",
