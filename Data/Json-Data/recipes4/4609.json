The only difference is the only dry herb we used was parsley, we didn't add the italian herbs, so it had a more mild taste and went with more meals. In the end we would sprinkle on some \"paprika\" for a little bit of red color and then wrap each half for sale. It makes garlic bread similar to the ones you get at the grocery store deli, and I even think it tastes a little like the frozen ones, but the ingredients are more natural and it is cheaper to make.",

I didn't have Fines Herbes (equal parts Tarragon, Parsley, Chervil, Chives), so mine had to go without the 1/16 tsp of Tarragon and Chervil. It was still great though!  I used unsalted butter, but maybe next time a little salt would be nice (or maybe just use margarine like someone suggested?) I tried both baking it into the bread and spreading it onto warm bread, and yeah, duh, baking it in makes a world of difference. This recipe makes enough to spread onto 1 small loaf of Italian bread.
