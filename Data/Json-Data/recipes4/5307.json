Every time she made them, they were different, but this is the basic idea of this recipe! If she didn't have cream, she made a basic white sauce with milk and butter and used that, but usually she made them when she had extra cream from the farm!",

In my covered casserole dish the potatoes cooked through in about 30 minutes. Although they fell apart more than I expected (next time I will slice a little thicker by hand rather than using the slicer) they were delicious (although a bit too buttery for my taste). I ended up sprinkling with some shredded jack cheese and adding a bit more milk to make more of a sauce. This will definitely be added to my regular side dish rotation.",

I layered the potatoes with sliced butter salt pepper onion powder cooked chopped bacon cheese a mixture of 1/2 heavy whipping cream and 1/2 milk on each layer. I made two layers using 5 smaller russett potatoes sliced thin. I used the recommended amount of butter but feel I will use 1/2 of that next time (1/4 cup). This recipe is not for calorie concious! But it is amazingly delicious! I only gave it four stars by itself as written... changes made to the recipe really made it five stars for sure.",
