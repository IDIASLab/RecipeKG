I didn't have any cereal to use for the coating, so I used a combination of crushed crackers and homemade breadcrumbs.  It turned out great.  Next time I will add the full amount of garlic - I cut it a bit becuase it seemed like to much, but it needed the garlic.  I thinned the sour cream with a little milk, which made it coat more evenly.  I think the sour cream is the key to this chicken, and that whatever breading and seasoning you prefer to use will be fine. I was amazed at how juicy the meat was and how crispy the outside got.  The cooling rack idea worked so well.  I would recommend skinning the chicken - I skinned a few pieces and then got lazy and left the rest on, and I didn't think the skin added much (except fat.) I used various chicken parts and all came out great - I'm always on the look out for recipes that work well with the less expensive cuts of chicken, and this was a winner.",

I did take suggestions and altered it a bit: I mixed ALL of the seasonings (I used garlic powder, salt, cumin, oregano and thyme) into the sour cream PLUS I added crushed French fried onions (the kind that usually goes on top of green bean casserole). I also added some more crushed french friend onions into the crushed cornflakes. And, I used boneless chicken thighs. The chicken was moist and the coating was crispy. Easy recipe and will definitely make again! LEFT OVER NOTE.....With the left overs, I put them in the oven at 400, topped with spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese and served over pasta. A great way to make 'chicken parm'.  Family went nuts over it and didn't realize it was the chicken from 2 days before!",

This is about as low fat as I can or want to get when I cook! The family had no idea it was a \"lower fat\" fried chicken! Make sure you season the sour cream (salt, soy sauce, pepper, herbs, whatever you like). Using warming racks to cook the chicken on really helps too.",

The sour cream covered the chicken very heavily and so this made the final result a nice thick coating. I did use the cooling rack and it worked out fine. No coating fell off during cooking.
