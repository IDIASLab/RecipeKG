Maybe cook a large cake in a water bath for a longer time. Also I was not familiar with the cajeta. It tasted good to me but I thought it was too sticky for people with dental issues aka dentures lol. I am going to try with Hersheys caramel syrup so my husband doesn't get lockjaw haha.

We usually do not make it with spice cake but with yellow cake or by mixing in chunks of ready-made pound cake with the flan mixture. I wanted to try this recipe because of the cajeta and the spice cake variation. I think it is great but I did have a hard time with the cajeta (dulce de leche) because it was very hard to spread it evenly in the pans. What worked for me was putting some cajeta in the pans and then putting the pans in the oven for a few minutes for it to soften enough so that I could spread it easier. Still I would rather make a regular flan caramel (heating/caramelizing sugar and water) and use that next time instead of the cajeta. I think it would taste better and also it would look prettier when flipped.",
