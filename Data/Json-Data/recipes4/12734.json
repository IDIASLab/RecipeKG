I made a few changes from the original to suit our tastes: I omitted the dumplings and used veggie stock in stead of water. I also pureed half of the veggies (after cooking in the broth for about 20 mins) in a food processor then stirred back into the pot to give the soup a more hearty creamy consistency. I served with \"Papa Drexler's Bavarian Pretzels\" which are so easy and fun to make with kids. Delicious!!",

When I served it it definitely needed more salt but I think the recipe was excessive. To make this again I would still cut the salt in half in the broth and the dumplings but would leave the salt full strength in the cheese sauce. That still cuts 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt from the original recipe (288 milligrams of sodium per serving!). The only other change I would recommend is some pepper otherwise the recipe is perfect. I will make this recipe again reducing the salt by 1/2 in the broth and the dumplings. Thank you for a keeper!",
