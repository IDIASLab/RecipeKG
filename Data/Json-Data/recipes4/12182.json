I do not have to feel guilty like I do with the waffles my hubbie makes with a whole stick of butter!!! I cut the apples in chunks as another reveiwer suggested and the apple taste and texture came through clearly and wonderfully. Note of warning -- these do take really long to cook. I thought 7 minutes sounded awfully long but it is about right. Also they are not light and fluffy like you might think of when you hear \"waffles\". These are almost another category of food. They are pretty heavy and almost crunchy. Very good! Thanks!",

Used 1 egg instead of 1.5 egg whites. Of the whole wheat flour substituted 1/4 c white flour. Added flaxseed meal about 1T. Added 1T brown sugar and used 1 t baking powder instead of yeast since didn't have any on hand. Added 2T butter. Didn't have any applesauce so just grated more apple and also used apples in small chunks total 2 medium apples. Didn't have any apple spice so used 1 t cinnamon. Instead of water I used skim milk upping the total to 1.5 c and mixed all wet ingredients at once. Maybe because of my changes the waffles didn't take THAT long to cook maybe 4-5 minutes. Tasted great and will make it again. Fluffy but not that crispy on the outside.",

I also used flax seed meal in place of the wheat bran (all I had on hand) I needed to add a lot more water & milk because the batter was really thick. The recipe is good for what they are...a healthy waffle. If you make these expecting a light crunchy fluffy FATTENING waffle you will be disappointed. Having said all that after I made the first one I upped the spices. I wanted a lot more flavor. I didn't measure so these are guesstimates...keep in mind that I quadrupled the recipe from the beginning.. I added about 3 Tablespoons of cinnamon 1 Tablespoon of vanilla 3-5 teaspoons of cloves 3-4 teaspoons of allspice 2-3 teaspoons of nutmeg and another 1-2 teaspoons of salt. These tasted pretty darn decent for a healthy waffle. The apples make them really moist though and I think some people mistake the moistness for needing more cook time. If I have any extra apples in the future I need to use up I would probably make the recipe from this site for 'Whole Grain Waffles' and just shred up apples BUT they are also more fattening than these ones because these have no oil so keep that in mind. Try these if you are looking for a really really healthy waffle.",
