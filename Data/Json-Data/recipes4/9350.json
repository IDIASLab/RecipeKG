Slight changes: I used a dark chocolate fudge cake mix, with 1/2 cup veg. oil and 1/3 cup milk (to help with the batter consistency), and 1 cup of chocolate chips. I baked it in a bundt cake pan at 335 degrees for 55-60 min. It turned out perfectly! Very rich and moist, but not at all wet or 'crispy' on the outside edges. Let it cool for an hour in the pan, then removed and drizzled the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site over it, garnished with strawberries and powdered sugar. Great presentation and great rich, chocolate taste. I would bake this again! I'll have a picture up soon.\nUpdate (10/24): Was wondering if anyone had used this recipe for cupcakes? Wasn't sure how the recipe would hold up when baked in a smaller size. Thanks!",

But I've had so much trouble lately with  getting my chocolate cakes moist because of the high altitude I'm at, so I'll try anything. It turned out perfect. I cooked it in 9\" cake pans for a birthday cake filled it with raspberry & frosted with chocolate buttercream. Everyone raved about it, and it was so moist. I used the mini chocolate chips and they were perfect, melted totally. My husband said it was almost like a brownie cake. Great for decorating because it holds it shape and doesn't crumble. It will be my standard chocolate cake recipe, can't wait to try it again with different fillings and frostings. Yum!!!",

I replaced the h2o with strong coffee and used a bag (11.5 oz.) of Ghirardelli's 60% cocoa bittersweet chocolate chips. I used 1 round and 1 8x8 pan so that I could cut the round cake in half and push it against 2 of the squares sides to form a heart. These baked perfectly at 330 for 45 minutes. I topped it with whipped cream and strawberries I dipped in chocolate. This made a good sized heart cake that was devoured in 2 nights. It was so rich and chocolate-y that we could not keep our hands off of it. Thank you for the fabulous recipe!",

I love that this cake is guaranteed to rise and have a fine texture due to the cake and pudding mixes yet it is lifted from being 'just a cake mix' by the addition of sour cream and the chocolate chips.\n\nI found this cake very easy to make and it was a blessing in disguise that the top of the cake rose above the rim of my tin.  When the cake cooled, I was able to cut a perfectly flat base for the cake.. and thus sample the cake warm.  It was bliss when eaten with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.\n\nI followed reccommendations of other reviewers by cutting the oil to 1/2 cup, adding 1/3 cup milk and cutting back the chocolate chips to about 1 1/4 cups, or a large bag of chocolate chips in Australian brands.\n\nI agree that this cake is enough without a glaze, but as I'm making this for a birthday (mine!!) - I will be topping it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this website.\n\nThis is a great recipe to have when you need a special cake quickly and with the minimum of fuss.\n\nTwo thumbs up!  I am sure the chocoholics in my family will polish this up tonight.",

I only use 1/2C of olive oil (more would leave the outside crispy), 1/3C milk (helped w/consistency), 1C chocolate chips (more is too much & just a waste) & greased generously w/PAM to prevent any problems.  From a baking video, it's best to cut out a piece of wax/parchment paper in shape of what you're baking in & put on bottom, so you can easily take out & work w/layers. Also, I wanted to make sure some 1st timers didn't make the same mistake I did the 1st time I made this.  I forgot about the chocolate chips so when checking to see if this was done, I almost overcooked it b/c my toothpick kept coming up with what I thought was batter.  DOH!! Cooking at 335 for 55 minutes was perfect.  I used Satiny Chocolate Glaze like many others but had no idea it really wasn't a glaze but came on more like a frosting.  Next time I'll try a more traditional chocolate frosting as the kids kept wondering what all that fancy gooey stuff that did not taste \"great\" was instead of their normal chocolatey frosting. :)",
