I'm living away from them for a little while so when I got a craving for Aji de Gallina, this filled the bill to a T!  I did change it a little bit to make it a little healthier, and I was so so so happy with the results.  I used whole wheat bread instead of white, and fat-free evaporated milk instead of the regular kind.  I had to use a little more chicken stock in the sauce because the high gluten content in the wheat bread  sucked up all the moisture so quickly.  \n\nThe result was a mere 141 calories and 4 grams of fat.  It tasted just like my father-in-law's recipe that he's been cooking for years.  So if you care about the nutrition, there you go!\n\nI'm so happy that I found a recipe (on paper) that I'm comfortable with.  ",

This was great but an entire loaf of bread was too much--the end product was way too thick and tasted like white bread. Next time I will try half a loaf. I also doubled the aji for more flavor. Edit: A few adjustments can make this recipe restaurant quality. Making homemade chicken stock is a beautiful thing but I usually don't have time. I like to use rotisserie chicken (for a pollo a la brasa flair) and store-bought chicken broth. Use 4-6 slices of bread (I like to use homemade whole wheat bread and I think it contributes to the nutty flavor). Double the parmesan cheese. Make sure you use aji paste not powder (find it at the Latino market). Double or even triple the aji for more flavor (you can add more to individual plates when serving if some members of your family like more spice). Also I have successfully used almonds when I had no walnuts. The sauce thickens a lot as it cools so keep adding chicken broth as needed. Last time I used 2-2 cups total for the recipe. I think the olives give the dish a wonderfully distinctive Peruvian flair but they are an acquired taste (hence the nickname \"mata gringos\"). Love this dish--thanks for sharing the recipe Emma!",

Having followed the recipe this time next time I'd just use my own chicken stock and add cooked chicken to it followed by the other steps. It was a long unnecessary step for me to boil the meat and veggies to make stock when I always keep homemade stock on-hand anyway. You could also use canned stock. It'd be a good recipe if you have leftover chicken to use up.",

I soaked my bread cubes in some chicken broth and then mashed it up with a fork to get a creamy consistency. Sauteed a chopped red onion in aji amarillo paste and aji panca paste along with garlic salt and pepper. Next added the shredded chicken with a little extra broth to achieve a consistency of a stew. After simmering for a few minutes to blend the chicken with the aji amarillo and aji panca flavors I added my bread/broth mixture along with the evaporated milk and Parmesan cheese. Added the chopped walnuts last and reduced to a thick stew. I served the Aji de Gallina over boiled potatoes with a side of rice and garnished with boiled eggs black olives and orange pepper. And was even blessed to have some Inca Kola to go along with this very delicious and easy meal to cook. Viva El Peru!",
