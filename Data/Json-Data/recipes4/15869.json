I think if you rate a recipe you need to follow the directions-at least the first time!   I have made some changes since then.   First I use low sodium chicken broth instead of water.  I also use two or three carrots and an additional  clove of garlic (we like garlic).  and an additional bay leaf since I use fresh bay leaves from a tree and they don't seem very strong.  I also added about a half a cup of chopped celery leaves and a small diced potato.  Rather than removing some liquid and putting it in the blender to thicken it, I  use my potato masher and that does a fine job without having to wash the blender.",

First, I used 1/2 fat free, low sodium chicken broth and 1/2 chicken stock for the water. 2nd, I substitted two smoked turkey legs for the pork. You can find them in the frozen foods. I just put them in skin and all, when cooking the beans (they won't fall apart that way). When they're done and cool enough to handle, discard skin, bone and fat; putting the meat back into the soup.  I used 2 carrots and 2 med potatoes chopped and upped the garlic to 3 cloves (we love garlic).  If you like it spicy, you can add a couple of chopped, seeded jalapenos! Thanks for a great recipe Jerry!",
