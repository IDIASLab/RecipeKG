For starters I chose to use fresh broccoli over frozen because all of the other veggies were fresh and it just made sense to me. I have been trying to watch my sodium intake and so I chose to sub the 7 bouillon cubes/3 cups of water for 3 cups of low sodium chicken broth. The directions did not say to peel the russet potato but red potatoes are the only ones that I leave the skin on so I did that out of personal preference. The cayenne was a nice touch and added to the overall flavor. All in all this is an excellent recipe and one I will make again but I will stick with the changes I made.",

I did change two things regarding the ingredients:  I used fresh broccoli (although I am sure frozen would work just fine), and I also used a quart of turkey broth I had canned after Thanksgiving in place of the bouillon.  I also changed the order in which I added some of the ingredients.  I added the garlic at the same time as the onion.  I also added the bay leaf at the same time I tossed in the carrots and potato.  I cooked the carrots and potato in the broth for quite a bit longer than 4 minutes- I wasn't timing it, but it was at least a half and hour, probably longer.  The carrots were still firm, not at all mushy, at the end.  I can only imagine they would be pretty raw and crunchy if not cooked longer!  I still cooked it the additional 15 minutes after adding the Velveeta, and the veggies were very much to my liking that way.  I added a very healthy pinch of cayenne, and it really added a wonderful kick and flavor to the finished product.  I was going to make a Rotel dip with the other half of my 2 pound Velveeta block, but I would much rather make this soup again- it is THAT good!  Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe crystal0!  I will be making this frequently!  :)",

I had cream on hand so used it instead of milk no Velvetta so used shredded cheddar cheese. I'm not a fan of bouillon cubes had both cubes and stock on hand but tried cubes and water and was really happy the way it turned out! I cut my frozen broccoli into smaller pieces... next time I'll cut them even smaller and possibly blend 1/2 of the cooked broccoli and add it back to the soup. Will definitely make again THANKS for sharing your Christmas Eve tradition with us!",

Since we had no Velveeta, I used cheddar cheese. Big mistake. It didn't melt smoothly and made the soup look curdled. But, hey, the flavor was great!",
