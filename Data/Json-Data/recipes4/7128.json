It was very tasty and very simple! The sauce is delicious! I didn't have sirloin steak or beef stock so I used turkey meatballs and chicken stock instead and it was still fabulous!! This is a going to be a keeper in our house and next time I will be sure to use the sirloin steak. Thanks so much for posting this husband and kid friendly meal. So quick to make as well. Oh and one more thing, I also didn't have regular onion. I used a red onion which added a sweetness to the sauce. YUMMMMMY!!!! Thanks again for adding a staple meal to our house! \nM~E",

I doubled the recipe (I had 2.37 lbs. of sirloin) and added an extra cup of beef stock and half a cup of red wine. I cooked the onion with diced garlic, around 6 cloves worth. I make a batch of garlic every two weeks, at least two bulbs, diced in the food processor and stored in olive oil in a glass jar, so I can only guess at the amount. Instead of peas I used two 7 oz. cans of drained, sliced mushrooms. I used about 1/2 to 3/4 of a teaspoon of thyme instead of pinches. This came out amazingly tasty. I highly recommend adding red wine to the beef stock. My boyfriend and I ate huge portions last night and it made a great lunch for me today, too. I will make this again.",
