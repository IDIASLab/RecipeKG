After our turkey dinner is over, my husband immediately takes most all the meat off the carcass (putting aside any small scraps to be used in the soup) and cuts the carcass in manageable pieces.  Then I put the carcass in my largest crock pot along with a large onion, some cut up carrots and celery, and salt and pepper.  I cook it all night on low and the next morning after discarding the carcass and vegetables, I have the most wonderful stock.  I can then freeze the stock and turkey scraps until a couple weeks later when the family is again yearning for turkey.",

I used tomatoes, as per recipe, but prefer turkey soup without them, so will leave them out next time. Also, I prefer a stronger turkey flavor, so I'll cut the water back to 3 quarts.  I added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and did not strain the broth. Great recipe for those who have never tried this method. Thanks.  : )",

Here's what I did: Using 4 quarts of chicken broth, 1 whole head of garlic gently crushed, 3 cut up carrots, 3 stalks of cut up celery and one onion diced.  I simmered the carcass for almost 7 hours and then strained the broth twice and tossed out the solids.  Instead of shredding a whole cabbage I used a bag of pre-shredded cole slaw.  I didn't use potatoes but with 10 mins left to simmer I put in a bag of medium egg noodles.  I had at least a full 1 1/2 lbs of turkey meat trimmed from the carcass that was also diced up and put in the pot. Everything else was exactly as written in the recipe. This was an incredible soup that we'll be eating for the better part of this week since it made so much.  Highly recommend using this recipe when needing to use up the holiday turkey. So GOOD!!",

After that, place the turkey carcass, quartered onion, two carrots chopped in one inch pieces, three celery ribs quartered, a tablespoon of peppercorns, a bay leaf or two, rosemary sprigs if you have them as well as sage leaves.  Add water to cover, you may add broth if you feel like it.  Let it simmer for about 4 hours.  Let cool, strain and continue as noted in the recipe.
