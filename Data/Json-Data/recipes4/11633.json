                "reviewBody": "In constant search of cheap meal ideas, I decided to give this a try.  As written, I would have to rate this a 2 because lentils don't need to be soaked before cooking and the recipe calls for too much water-the general ratio is 2 parts water to one part lentils.  If I had followed the directions of the recipe, this would have been REALLY watery/liquidy and I think pretty gross.  Here is what I did . . .  I rinsed 2 cups of brown lentils and simmered them with 4 cups of water, adding more water as needed until they were cooked to the right texture (was doubling the recipe).  I added 5 cloves of chopped garlic and doubled the rest of the spices, except the cayenne (too spicy for my 3 yr old).  As it simmered, it smelled good but looked boring so I sauteed some shredded carrots, yellow bell pepper, and zucchini in a separate pan while I caramelized the onion (a whole one).  When the lentils were done, I added the sauteed veggies and the caramelized onions to the pot and stirred it up.  I served it over Basmati Rice, topped it with cilantro and it still needed something.  Paneer would have been great but I didn't have it so used some white crumbly Mexican cheese on the top (feta would have been great too).  The end result was amazingly delicious!  I will definitely make it again-in the future, I will add more veggies, caramelize 2 onions, cut down the lentils and use veggie broth to simmer the lentils in, plus add paneer to the top.  Thanks for the idea and great spice combinati",

Like most traditional recipes this one can be adjusted to the palettes of those you'll be serving. I do plan to increase the cayenne next time but still found it delicious. My fiance who is not picky but doesn't normally eat much cleaned his plate. I made only two small changes: first I used whole rather than ground coriander -- I think I used about two teaspoons worth -- since I had no ground coriander and didn't feel like taking time to grind it. Second I threw in a can of chick peas drained and cooked them with the lentils: not a necessary addition but they went beautifully with the lentils and spices. For accompaniment I steamed about 1/4 of a smallish green cabbage cut into four chunks on top of the lentils for the last 6 or 8 minutes. I served the curry with rice home-made flatbreads and a modified tzaziki sauce. In short Jerry Javed's Pakistani Lentil Curry is guaranteed to become a part of my regularly recipe rotation. One more caveat -- households of two such as mine may want to halve the recipe. It makes a lot! That said I'm looking forward to lentil curry for breakfast tomorrow morning!",

However I found that 2 cups was not quite enough- by the time the water was all absorbed the lentils were still a bit tough so I would recommend 2.5-3 cups. I imagine that 3 cups would give you a bit more of a soupy consistency (great over bowls of rice). I also took the advice to increase the amount of the spices and I doubled everything except the cayenne (my husband is a bit sensitive to spicy dishes). However I would have enjoyed even more flavor so I would consider adding a bit more of the other spices too. We added a squeeze of lemon just before eating which was tasty. I have also heard that adding salt to uncooked lentils can make them tough so I waited until closer to the end of their cook time to add salt.",
