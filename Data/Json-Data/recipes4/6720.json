No whole wheat bread but I did have some leftover bolillo rolls (1-1/2 to be exact) that needed to be used up so I just cubed those up instead. I used leftover ham from yesterday's Easter dinner and a tiny chunk of fontina cheese and a bit of Pecorino Romano to make 1/4 cup. I don't buy the diced tomatoes that contain the basil garlic and oregano because Hubs hates them - so I used a can of plain diced tomatoes and then added my own fresh basil some dried oregano and fresh garlic. Because I used fresh garlic I cut the garlic powder back to 1/2 tsp. It was DELICIOUS! Pretty much the same recipe just subbing to use what I had on hand. That's what I love about recipes like this... with the same basic ingredients you can create something fabulous! This is going to be a light dinner for tonight after our food coma from yesterday's Easter feast!",

I realized I had prepped too much sausage & broccoli so I used a larger dish and increased all the ingredients a bit. I only have no salt added diced tomatoes (without the herbs) so I sprinkled in some Italian seasoning. And I used half & half instead of heavy cream because that's what I had. It came together easily & we enjoyed it. My husband said he would prefer it without broccoli so I'm knocking off one star for that. This is a flexible recipe which could easily be modified to have a Tex-Mex flair with some saut\u00e9ed onions & peppers and a little different seasonings. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe Muffin Boots!",

In place of the pepper jack I used shredded Mexican cheese and 2% milk for cream. I didn t have the seasoned canned tomatoes but had a Roma and a few grape tomatoes which i seasoned with 3/4 tsp dried basil and 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano along with garlic powder called for in original recipe. I only baked 30 minutes as i like my eggs less firm. It was easy and delicious! Next time I will do as another reviewer and try turkey sausage. Also as I am a broccoli lover I will add a bit more!
