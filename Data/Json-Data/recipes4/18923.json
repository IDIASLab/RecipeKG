There is quite a bit of cayenne and while this doesn't make the actual meat spicy if you'd like to use the drippings be aware that it will be spicy. Also my chicken was 4lbs and it was done at 1h 15 so for a 2lb chicken as stated in the recipe you'll want to check well before this amount of time. Thanks for the recipe!",
