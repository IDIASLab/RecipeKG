I could not get all the ingredients to fit in my \"smaller\" crockpot which I think is 3qt (the big is 6qt, I think) so I kept having to stir the rice a lot. In the end, the rice kind of melted by the 2nd day, and I think that's due to it being white rice in a slow cooker. I'm not really sure how to fix that other than to readjust the ratios significantly but I think it's doable if you don't think you will eat all this in one evening. It is fantastic for a large one-night meal, though.",
