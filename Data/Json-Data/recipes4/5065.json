We also loved the spicy zip of the red pepper flakes (we LOVE spicy food).  I followed the recipe to the letter (all except I used regular diced tomatoes instead of those with green chiles, and I used 3/4 of a lb of shrimp instead of a full pound because it was really expensive at my local seafood store).\r\n\r\nThe fresh parsley is a great touch and the leftovers are almost as good as the first go-round.\r\n\r\nI will add this to my recipe box and make it again.  Although next time, I might add another 1/2 cup of diced tomatoes, and will try the ones with the green chiles as suggested.  Thanks Rachel!",
