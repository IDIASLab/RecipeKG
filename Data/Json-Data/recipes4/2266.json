Make sure you put on a boiler pan so grease can drain. Also, if at 20 min. the bacon is not done enough for your taste, do not just let it bake longer...the cheeses will run out! Instead, broil for the last 5 minutes to crisp up the bacon.WEAR GLOVES & melon baller does an easy job of taken the seeds and veins out. As you are de-seeding them, put the clean ones in a bowel of cold water in the sink. Run clear cold water thru them or rinse and change water. Soak them while you are preparing other ingredients.Take gloves off and discard as soon as you are finished handling the peppers or you could get the hot pepper juice on your cabinet pulls, frig door, pot handle,etc! After assembly, place the whole pan of peppers in the freezer for 15-20 minutes to get the cheeses really cold so they don't ooze out!  UPDATE: To make them faster, after you have the peppers cleaned and soaking in cold water...make little \"cigars\" of the filling approx. the size of your peppers. Then just place inside the pepper, mash in a bit, stick in freezer to chill. It made filling them go so quick that way...",

Regardless of what anyone else brings to a potluck, if these are around, they are the first to disappear.  I'm sure the sausage version is just as good, or perhaps even better.\n\nI do have a couple of suggestions:  there are jalapenos and there are jalapenos.  In years past, they all had a lot of heat.  Now it seems to depend on whether they are from an \"Americanized\" hybrid.  Some of them are not much spicer than a bell pepper.  Also, if you make sure that the chiles are baked to a point of tenderness (cover loosely with foil if they are browning too quickly), much of the heat of the chile is diminished.  \n\nIf a hot chile does happen to get you, don't drink water or beer to cut the heat...it won't happen.  Milk is the antedote as it cuts the capsaicin, which is not water soluble but responds to milk, sour cream, etc.",

Tips - to make them less greasy - just pile the sausage on paper towels after you cook it!  All that grease gets sucked down and you are fine.  As well, I recommend putting the peppers in the oven (same temp) for about 8 to 10 minutes so they get a bit soft.  And a quick tip for gutting the peppers out - use a small melon baller.  Saves you so much trouble.  Other than that, picture perfect, thanks a mil!",
