On instinct, I went ahead and doubled my seasonings, and I'm glad I did. It came out perfect. Plus, I added about 1T of maple syrup...YUM-O! Also, I find the mixing combines with the meat a little more evenly if you mix up all the seasonings, THEN add the meat, then add the maple syrup (opt) and mix it through once more. This recipe is awesome! I'm so glad I tried it! I made turkey sausage, egg, and chz biscuits. Delish! Thanks so much! This one's a keeper! UPDATE: Once seasoned, the meat will keep in the refrigerator, uncooked, for about 3 days or so, no problem (probably because of the salt). So if I season up more meat than I need, I just put the rest in the fridge and eat off of it for the next few days. This way, I get more of that \"fresh-cooked\" taste. Enjoy!",

I used Foster Farms ground turkey and they come in packages of 1.25 lbs.  The seasonings seemed just right for this quantity of meat, although I'll probably cut back the salt a little next time.  I used Kosher salt.  \nFor an experiment, I separated some of the meat mixture and added half a grated apple. It's really good!  It also adds much-needed moisture to the sausage if you're using 99% fat-free turkey.",

I tried this recipe and was extremely surprised with how good it was! I would use the recipe as-is for foods like tacos or for breakfast wraps for the kids. I would double the spices to add to spaghetti sauce or my version of green chile' stew. I like the bite of using black peppercorns ground to a medium courseness. Another thing I did was after mixing the turkey with the spices I shaped it into mini patties and froze them on a tray. When frozen I took them off the tray and bagged them... now it is easy to grab just as much as I need to cook for a soup or sandwich. Next I plan on trying this recipe as a base for meatloaf or meatballs. Update: Was recently given some store bought pork sausage cooked some tasted it and it wasn't near as good as this recipe. I decided to use the spices used in this recipe half the amount mixed with the sausage and the sausage was improved a hundred percent.",

Before adding the spices to the meat I first mixed them with a couple Tablespoons of coconut oil because my ground turkey was very lean. I used a cookie scoop to portion the mixture onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment then I shaped them into patties. My sheet fit 9 patties so I layered parchment over those and did it again. I ended up with 3 layers of perfectly portioned and stacked patties totaling 27. Once they freeze I will cut the paper between patties and store in freezer bags. PERFECT. EASY. AWESOME!",
