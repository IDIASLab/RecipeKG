I made the burger patties exactly as written, but after forming them I put them in a 425 degree oven for 10 minutes on each side to bake off a good deal of the grease. While they were baking I sauteed two large, sliced onions with a teaspoon of minced garlic in two tablespoons of butter until the onions were soft. To the onions I added the three cans of Cream of Mushroom soup (used fat-free), two soup cans of water, two beef boullion cubes, and enough Kitchen Bouquet (probably about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon)to darken the gravy/sauce mixture; I let this simmer over low heat until all of the meat patties were browned. Then I drained the grease from the browning pan, wiped the pan clean, put the meat patties back into the pan on top of a bit of the gravy/sauce, and poured the rest on top of the meat. Reset the oven to 350, covered the pan with foil, and baked for one hour more. This was delicious; lots of flavor and the patties were very moist. We put the gravy/sauce on top of mashed potatoes, and also had fresh, lightly steamed broccoli on the side. Thank you for this recipe...my husband and son went crazy over this (husband ate three meat patties, son ate two)! I used the entire three pounds of ground beef and ended up with a total of 12 patties. So glad I don't have to cook tomorrow!",

Instead of making seperate patties, I covered the bottom of the dish with the hamburger, cooked 10 minutes @ 350 degrees, poured off the grease then cut the meat into six seperated sections before pouring the mushroom soup over the top then I put on the canned mushrooms. I made this just like the recipe called for with the exception of getting rid of a LOT of grease before puting the soup on. You can also make this with tater tots inbeded in the soup before putting it in the oven for 45 minutes.  If you want to put the tater tots on, don't put the foil cover on. Very easy, very quick and very tasty.",

I also seasoned the patties with onion powder and seasoned salt instead of garlic powder and italian seasoning. Following the advice of another reviewer, I first browned the patties at 425 for 10 minutes a side and then poured off the grease (glad I did- it was the cheap stuff, so there was plenty to pour off). While doing that, I sauted half an onion and a clove of garlic, then added the cream of mushroom and about 2/3 can of water and let that simmer until the patties were done browning. After pouring off the grease, I added the gravy mixture to the patties, covered with foil, and baked at 350 for another 25 minutes. It was GREAT. Served with mashed potatoes and black eyed peas-- a good cheap meal!",

                "reviewBody": "This was allright. Nothing special but decent nonetheless. Both my hubs & I agree that Anne Marie Sweden's hamburger steaks w/ onions & gravy is FAR superior to this recipe (these \"steaks\" were too bland for our liking). Yes the two are different but only slightly so - the gravy here is mushroom based & Anne Marie's gravy is just a basic (but SUPER flavorful) brown gravy. As many others have done I too made several changes. W/o them I'm afraid I would have liked this even less. Keep in mind that I only made 1/3 of this recipe (4 steaks) since I was feeding 2 people. I set my oven to 425 degrees baked my steaks for 10 min. per side reduced the oven temp. to 350 drained all grease & then proceeded as directed. My other changes were to saute a sm. (sliced) yellow onion & a t of minced garlic in 1 T butter until softened / fragrant top my steaks w/ the mixture add a.75 oz. packet of McCormick brand brown gravy mix & 1.5 c. H2O to my can of condensed cream of mushroom soup & pour over all. After I took everything out of the oven I noticed my gravy hadn't thickened (I worried about adding so much H2O but it was too late to do anything about it). To fix the issue I mixed 1 T cornstarch w/ 1 T cold H2O poured my gravy into a sm. saucepan added the cornstarch slurry & brought to a slight boil to thicken. Perfect! Served w/ garlic mashed potatoes & corn this was an \"OK\" meal but not one I'd repeat again. Thanks anyways RHONDA!:-)",
