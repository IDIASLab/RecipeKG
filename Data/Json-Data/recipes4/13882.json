Sure, there is one less pot to clean up, which is great, of course.  But what I liked even better was that by cooking the pasta in the sauce, it eliminated that little ring of water that always seems to gather around the edge of my plate when I have pasta with sauce.  It also ensures that all the noodles are covered in sauce.  However, I had to deduct 2 stars from my rating because the sauce comes out tasting rather bland.  However, after making this a few more times, I was able to take care of that problem.  Instead of mixing in 2 cups of water, I use 1 cup of water, and 1 cup of tomato juice (I prefer V8 Hot & Spicy to give the sauce a bit of a kick).  I also always add a pound of browned ground beef, because I don't like meatless pasta dishes.  I will continue to make this recipe with my changes, because I love the cooking method.",

Instead of using water, I used chicken broth (base) and three cups of it too!  Of course I added my own special fixings, like smoked sausage, peppers, mushrooms, onions, etc.  I also used one can of canned chopped Italian-style tomatoes.  Never tasted sooooo good!!",

To add protein to mine I added 1/4 cup of cottage cheese and nuked in the microwave for 45 seconds. (Hubby doesn't like cottage cheese.) Mine was still awesome!
