I browned the venison with jalapenos and garlic and use brown sugar in place of the molasses because it's what I had on hand. I've never put jalapenos in sloppy joes until now but it totally works and really adds a nice flavor. I topped with pickles and pickled jalapenos. If you want to kick it up another notch red chili flakes would work really well in these as well. Great recipe!!",
