I've made bread we haven't liked as much, but it almost always works this way.  I did that with this bread and I have to say that either this is a bread that should only be made in the bread machine (highly unlikely in my opinion), or it's just not a bread that works for us.  I doubled the recipe because just by glancing at the ingredients I knew it would be a small loaf; however, that made for a sticky mess in my bread machine.  Don't worry, I'm used to them, but after putting it in the oven to rise, it rose too high and I ended up with another sticky mess--and that I'm not used to.  I tried again, then let it bake . . .and well, it worked, we got a loaf of bread, but hubs wasn't impressed with this.  It does have air pockets, and it's chewy, but it's not that soft--believe me, my husband is a stickler about that, so I would know--and it isn't as tasty as some of the breads I've tried.  Although okay, it's not our favorite.  However, it does remind me somewhat of English Muffins, so if you like that texture, you may want to be all over this bread.  Thanks for the recipe!",

Since I\u2019m using old bread machine set on medium crust-white bread, the first time I tried this, the bread fell. Then, I reduced the yeast to only 1 TSP, it worked out wonderful, although it was kinda short, about 3/4 loaf of the pan. I experimented a few times to get a full loaf: microwave 1 cup of room temperature water for 1 minute, then add honey, stir, and add yeast, then leave it for 10 minutes, then add 2 cups of flour--make sure the flour covers water-honey-yeast mixture, then add the rest of the ingredients. That's it! You'll get a full loaf. I also added 2 TBSP of Golden Flaxseed Meal, and sometimes 2 TBSP almond meal/flour. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!",

Knowing better,  but rushed for time, I followed the directions accordingly and got a very tasty loaf but the rise was not good.  This is often a sign that the dough was too wet. (the yeast that I used bloomed beautifully). I now babysit the bread machine while it is in the initial stages of mixing and kneading to make sure the dough has enough flour.  I know when it is ready when I can see that it no longer sticks to your finger or to the side of the pan.  On average, I am adding up to a 1/4 cup or more of flour - in very small increments- depending on the humidity in the air. I do check the dough right before the second rise as well.  By adding these steps, the bread now bakes up to the size of a 2 lb loaf while using ingredients for a 1 lb.  We love the lightness of the loaf and it makes for great garlic cheese bread or just toast.  Thanks for an easy recipe.",
