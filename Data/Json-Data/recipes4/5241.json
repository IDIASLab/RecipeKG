I didn't find the taste to be anything spectacular and the soup mixture was an unpleasant consistency; I'd say half a cup of milk should have been added. Additionally having the asparagus spears in the casserole made it messy to eat because they were difficult to cut. I would suggest cutting into smaller pieces. I would also suggest putting the noodles back in the pot after draining them and then mixing in everything except the crackers (including 1/2 cup of milk and chopped asparagus). Then pour it in the baking dish and put cracker crumbs on top.",

Because I was starting w/precooked noodles & chicken my prep was a little different. I cut up my asparagus & sauteed it in a pan w/onions mushrooms red peppers butter & garlic. Added the soups followed by the noodles & chicken. I tasted it before deciding to go ahead & add the cheese. This was super creamy...maybe a little too creamy for us but my ratio could've been off using the leftovers. I'd like to try it w/a different cheese also altho the cheddar was good! Eating leftovers for breakfast as I rate it & they're even better than lastnights dinner:)",
