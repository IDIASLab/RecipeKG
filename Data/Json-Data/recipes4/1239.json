I'm not sure about the \"pickled\" giardinera (yuk) I use regular hot or mild giardenera drained, but not rinsed (it takes away from the flavor). I also use Vlasic sliced pepper rings instead of pepperoncini's (so that there is no need to cut off the stem, by the way, make sure that you DO cut the stem off, because it will fall off of the pepper after a period of cooking).  Use ZESTY Italian dressing mix, 2 (10.75 oz.) cans of beef broth (campbells is best), a few cloves of minced garlic, and a 1/2 bag of frozen pearl onions.  Make sure that you cook it atleast 15 hours (I usually start it at midnight if I'm going to serve at 3p.m. the next day) and the beef will fall apart.  Also, I learned this the hard way, if the roast has strings, cut them off because they will be hard to find when the meat falls apart.  Everybody loves this, it is one of my most requested recipes!

Then when it has been in the crock pot 18-20 hours the beef falls apart and mixes in with the chopped peppers...just right to spoon in Italian rolls with a little of the broth. YUM!!",

I omitted the mixed vegetables and used only half the pepperoncini (hot style) and added 6 oz. sweet roasted red peppers and 8 oz. hot pepper & olive giardiniera and the juices/oils of all three.  Eighteen hours seemed ridiculous but since this is made with such a lean roast I decided I'd see how it went and found it wouldn't have been the same if I hadn't gone the full 18 hours.  After about 12 hours I flipped the roast over so the top could cook in the juices for a while.  One reviewer noted the unpleasant smell and I noticed the same thing around hour five but it went away and soon smelled delicious.  I was very surprised to be able to actually slice the meat after that long in the slow cooker.  I sliced it as thin as I could and then let the slices sit in the juices while I buttered & browned the bread (I used the Fabulous French Loaves recipe divided and shaped into hoagie-style rolls). A slice of provolone between the warm toasted rolls and the hot juicy beef and peppers was a delicious combination that melted in my mouth.    ",
