I did the peppers as instructed,  but then I saut\u00e9ed the beans, onions, cumin, actual garlic (3 cloves), a serrano pepper and got those flavors married while the (brown) rice was cooking.  I took off the bean mixture after 10 min or so/when the onions were translucent, added some frozen corn and some shredded cheese (habanero cheddar) and waited on the rice.  Had a beer.  Waited on the rice to finish  Mixed it all up, topped it with the cheese and threw it in the oven.  DELICIOUS",

I did as another reviewer suggested and baked the green bell peppers (I used 8 peppers) for 10 minutes at 250 instead of boiling, as I didn't want them to lose their flavor. They were still pretty crunchy, so I wouldn't go that way if you want softer peppers, but I liked them just fine - and they still had that lovely bell pepper taste. I also used quinoa instead of rice - DEFINITELY the way to go. The texture was wonderful. I also followed a different reviewer's suggestion to improve the flavor profile by saut\u00e9ing the onion with fresh garlic (always use fresh!!) for 10ish minutes, then adding the beans, cumin, and chili powder for another 10 min of saut\u00e9ing, then setting aside until the quinoa was finished. Tossed those together with the tomatoes and cheese, and stuffed them into the peppers. The stuffing is DELICIOUS.\n\nGreat recipe overall. Healthy and delightful - and, even better, looks really pretty and fancy for dinner guests. Will definitely make again.",

I added quorn grounds that I sauteed with the onion and some South African smoke seasoning blend because I have to pacify my husband with faux meat on vegetarian nights but otherwise made the recipe as written and we both loved it. I had small bell peppers so there was a lot of filling left over so I used to rest of the filling to make \"enchiladas\" (wrapped the filling in tortillas, sprinkled cheese over the top, and baked them in the oven) and it was delicious that way as well.",

I made a few of substitutions, but stuck with the same basic recipe.  1) Instead of boiling, after cutting the peppers, I put them in the toaster oven on 'bake' at 250ish degrees for 10 minutes.  They turned out so perfect. 2) I didn't have chili-style tomatoes, so I diced up some cherry tomatoes and added a little salsa 3) instead of garlic salt, used granulated garlic and added a little extra salt 4) used Yellow peppers which gave a wonderful sweet taste.  I don't really like green peppers so this was a great substitution.  5) instead of rice, used Quinoa for extra protein.  Some of the quinoa actually tasted like ground beef after baking.  My Husband was impressed with this recipe and I've tried several other stuffed pepper recipes where he would shrug and say \"it's, okay\" but this was he said, \"Wow, this is actually good!\"  Thanks for the recipe!  Will definitely do again!",

Set the bottoms aside. Saut\u00e9ed the diced red parts with 1.5 cups of diced onion (pre-diced from Kroger- I refuse to cut onions) in olive oil. Added my spices here- eyeballed quantities of chopped garlic garlic salt lemon pepper seasoning (Kroger brand) cumin and chili powder. Added 1 lb of lean ground beef to the pot and cooked thoroughly. Plot twist: then I added 2 cups of water and a box of Zataran's dirty rice mix to the same pot with the meat and veggies still in it. Followed the cooking directions on the box. Removed from heat and mixed in the (drained not rinsed) can of black beans and (drained not rinsed) can of diced tomatoes. Added 2 cups of shredded Mexican blend cheese. Mix mix mix. Tasted to check spice levels. Died and went to heaven. Filled my bell pepper bottoms with the mixture and topped with a pinch of extra cheese. Baked the stuffed peppers on a foil-covered cookie sheet for 30 minutes at 350F. I ended up with way more filling than I needed for 6 peppers but I will either freeze it for future peppers or serve it another way. It's so good I could eat it with a spoon.",
