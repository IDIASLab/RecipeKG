However, we recently decided to have a vegetarian day each week so I had to find something that I could \"stomach\" to replace my preferred proteins. This was awesome, I did a couple of things differently, I left out the olive oil (actually I just forgot it but by the time I realized it I was already eating and it was so good that I know that I can save a bunch of calories for other stuff and not miss out on the flavor). I also love rosemary so I added that to the recipe but I don't know how much. All in all this was a big hit as I used it as the base to make a shepherd's pie. I'm going to do a lot of different recipes with this base. Thanks.",
