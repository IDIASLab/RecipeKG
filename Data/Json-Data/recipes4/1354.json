I also used Chilean Sea Bass which was really expensive (21.99lb) OUCH!!!!. But it was worth every penny. I charcoal grilled mine about 8 min per side over high heat. Can't say enough about this dish, will try a cheaper sea bass next time though. Chilean Sea Bass will be for special occasions. Oh!!! I almost forgot what ever you do please do not leave out the last step with a good quality EVOO it makes a world of difference. UPDATE!!!!!!  I MADE THIS AGAIN LAST NIGHT, ONLY I USED RED SNAPPER BECAUSE IT WAS ON SALE, IT TURN OUT REALLY GOOD, THIS IS A LIGHT FLAVORFUL FISH WITH RESTAURANT QUALITY TASTE. I DID GRILL MINE AND FOLLOWED RECIPE AS BEFORE. 5++++STARS.",

Then I added a little olive oil to my fish and added them to the bag and gave it a good shake.  I let them sit in the fridge until I was ready to cook them. I didn't have time to grill tonight, so I put them in the oven on 400 for about 15 mins.  They were great!  I also doubled the recipe for the spices.  I used 2 filets, very large in size.",

I double the amounts shown just for two servings. I am partial to Chilean Sea Bass and have made this several times with that fish. My only other change is that I drizzle the finished fish with white Truffle oil instead of regular olive oil before serving. Truffle oil is a highly refined olive oil with the fragrance of truffles. It\u2019s very pricey but you don\u2019t use much and it is usually only found in upscale grocery stores. If you can\u2019t find it in your area, just do a \u201cGoogle\u201d search and you can buy it online. It adds an incredible finishing touch to a fine dish and you will not be disappointed.",

It was certainly simple to do, and I read the reviews, which are very helpful, and I baked it at 400 for 20 mins. because my stove was being used for a pasta recipe.
