There is a trick that will make this come out perfect, except it adds one easy step. It's straining the ricotta, but you can't just stick it in a strainer like you would peas as folks tried. \n\nSo here's what you do: When you're at the store, buy the 15/16 oz container of ricotta (you'll use the whole thing). Head over the isle where they sell cooking wear and pick up some cheesecloth. It run $2-5 depending on where you live.  Fold it over 4 or more times. Put 1/2 of ricotta in the cheesecloth and squeeze the moisture out of it. Do the same with the other 1/2. You'll end up with 1 cup of dense ricotta. Voila! Perfect for gnocchi making.\n\nI also used 1/2 ww flour and 1/2 regular flour; minced garlic instead of powdered. Finally, instead of rolling it out and messing up the counters, I did it old school style and just pinched very small amounts (abt. 1 1/2 tsp) and rolled them. I ended up with 50 gnocchi. Perfect! Definitely a keeper.",

I'm a second-generation Italian, and can state categorically that no self-respecting Italian person with any connection to the old country would ever cook with garlic powder, let alone have it in his kitchen. Once you delete that stuff, this is a good, solid recipe for an old favorite. After cutting the individual gnocchi, roll them over the back of the tines of a fork, applying more pressure in the center, to get that authentic gnocchi appearance. The little valleys the fork tines create cradle your sauce. Gnocchi are nothing more than dumplings, Italian style. They can tend to be slightly heavier than normal pasta, which some don't find appealing. Those made with ricotta tend to be lighter than those made with potato, which is the more common variety. The sauce is a basic tomato/basil, which should work well for most palates.",
