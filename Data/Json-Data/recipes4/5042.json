Soft and a little gooey on the bottom and slightly crunchy on the top. I will definitely be picking up some toffee bits for next time. Update! I made these with toffee pieces and wow were the good. I took them to a little homemade ice cream gathering so they were paired with vanilla ice cream and they disappeared. I m glad I as smart enough to hold a few back just for us!",

I used french vanilla cake mix in place of yellow and omitted the vanilla in the filling because it was now in the crust. I also had 2/3 bag of toffee chips and 1/3 bag of chocolate coated toffee chips on hand so I used a combination. I baked the crust for 10-11 minutes and the filling for 27 minutes. It is a tad sweet (just cut into smaller bars) but oh so ooey gooey at the same time! Will definitely make again.",
