This shaved off about 100 calories and 10 grams of fat per serving!  I will definitely make this again.",

I pack bento lunches for myself so I'm always looking for good recipes to make on the weekend for the upcoming lunches and this was perfect. It actually makes 8 cups so to me it's 8 1-cup servings which makes the nutritional information very favorable! The only thing I'd change is that next time I'll put in even more asparagus because I love asparagus. I wanted to note for future cooks that I used frozen pre-cooked shrimp and it was fine. I also used powdered ginger as I didn't have any fresh but I used more of it. I used lime juice out of a bottle about 1/4 cup seemed the appropriate amount. This recipe will be a staple I know! Thanks for a great way to eat quinoa a real superfood.",

I only made a few alterations but nothing that would jeopardize the recipes integrity for instance: I added 3 cloves of garlic (I honestly can't imagine this recipe without garlic) omitted the raisins used pickled ginger instead of fresh (it's what I had on hand) used a fresh lemon instead of a lime (again what I had on hand this was a VERY NICE touch) and added a handful of spinach to give it a little more color and nutrition. It was delicious and healthy. The best part about this is that the leftovers can be eaten cold! I imagine that this would make a great summertime salad due to its fragrant citrus notes and fresh greens. Thank you for sharing I WILL make this again and possibly experiment with different ingredients!",
