Everything works together very well and makes this excellent unique tomato soup.

Surprising since I only picked it in order to use up some Bloody Mary mix in the fridge but it turned out lovely. I didn't have tomato clam sauce so just used the same amount of Bloody Mary mix--if I hadn't had enough I probably would've done the same as another reviewer and used tomato juice. I also used skim milk instead of half and half. It makes a good amount of soup--we had enough for 3 servings of leftovers which I'll likely put in lunches this week. thanks for the recipe!",
