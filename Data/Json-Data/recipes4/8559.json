I had to use chard because my beet greens were no good. I think that only affected the flavor in a better way. The puff pastry was very difficult to mold to a round pan. Not sure a spring form pan was necessary and a square or rectangular pan would\u2019ve been much easier To form the pastry to. The pastry after baking was half way down the sides of the pan even though it started out even with the top after rolling and piecing it together in some places. Added the ceramic balls to the bottom but didn\u2019t have enough to fill the entire pan but it actually didn\u2019t say to do so.  So I wasn\u2019t able to use all the egg mixture and could\u2019ve used 1 less egg and 1 cup of milk. Probably would not make again.",
