So, the second time I made it in two batches, with two different variations. In the first, I omitted only the bread (but used a mix of traditional and turkey kielbasa, to cut the fat content). My mother and husband are both diabetics, so this cut way down on the carbs (even though I did use whole grain bread the first time I made it). The second variation was much more drastic: I omitted the potatoes, and added 2 cubed sweet potatoes and three (well-scrubbed but not peeled) cubed beets. The beets, as you might imagine gave the dish a reddish-tinge, but all five of us thought both dished were excellent. My parents begged for leftovers and ate them for days!!",

I was a little concerned that it wouldn't be flavorful because there wasn't a lot of seasoning in the recipe, but the kielbasa really flavors the whole dish.  It's simple and delicious.  The only modification I made (due to lack of bread in the house) was omitting the bread, and adding buttered breadcrumbs on top.  I also had a problem with the potatoes not being cooked after 45 minutes, but another 10 minutes with foil on did the trick (as another reviewer suggested).  I didn't even need to add any extra broth.  Next time, I'll try cooking lasagna style...covered in foil for the first 30 minutes, and uncovered for the last 15 to crisp it up.",

I made this with leftover Brats from a BBQ the day before and added cauliflower, broccoli, celery, and a little onion to the cabbage and potatoes. Based on previous reviews, before adding the milk/egg mixture I poured about 1/2 cup of chicken broth in and covered with foil before baking. I baked it for 45 minutes, removed the foil and cooked an additional 15 minutes. I live at high altitude and usually have to cook things longer and with additional liquid so this may not have been needed at sea level. Will definitely make again!",

I added a little extra salt to my bowl my hubby added a dash of extra pepper to his but all that was done at the table according to preference so the recipe itself is pretty good. Don't expect any \"wow\" sort of flavoring - this isn't a pretentious dish. But it tastes good... and safe. Like I said its a meat and potatoes comfort food type dish. I used 2 med/large russet potatoes (slightly more than 2 cups) and they were diced fairly small (1/4-1/2\" dices). Used Hillshire Farms Polska Kielbsa - it was only 13-14oz. No one would have complained over having more sausage in it but there was enough and it wasn't worth opening another pack just for those few extra ounces. My store didn't have small heads of cabbage but even then I could barely fit 1/2 of a large head in (including all the leaves I removed to line the pan with). I just put in as much as my pan would allow. I baked for 40 minutes with no foil checked the potatoes and they weren't quite done. covered with foil as the tops were browning already and some exposed cabbage liners were burning. 15 more minutes with foil on did the trick. I will definitely make this again sometime. It was pretty easy and a nice change of pace.",
