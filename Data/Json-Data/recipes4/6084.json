I used enough chicken stock to moisten stuffing bread cubes not just 1/2 cup. Plus I used 3/4 stick butter instead of whole just because that is what I had on hand. Only needed to cook on low for 3 hours then 1/2 hour on high. Put gravy over it and it was wonderful.",

Also the dressing turned out to be gravy because of how moist it was but it was delicious gravy. We will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!",
