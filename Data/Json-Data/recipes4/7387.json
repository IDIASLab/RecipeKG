The only change to the recipe is the Roast Beef, instead I used a slow cooked Rib-Eye Roast that cooked for 8 hours with Liption Onion Soup Mix and a 1/4 cup of water. Pour half into the bottom of your crock pot and the rest over the top of the roast. Then carefully pour the water around the roast not over the top you want to leave those seasonings on the roast. \n\nWe plan on using the leftovers for another dinner and add some buttered grits and toast in a couple of days.",
