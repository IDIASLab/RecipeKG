My only real problem with this type of couscous is that I find it can be a little dry. As a result I like to serve it with a main dish that has sauce. I have had comments from some that they would have liked a dressing perhaps a vinigrette or something of that nature. All in all it is a great recipe and the green and red peppers definitely make it a christmas side dish. Cheers Glen",
