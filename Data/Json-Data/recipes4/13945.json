Also I liked that you are not instructed to cut them apart which seemed simpler. I actually did not get to try these but my husband sister and kids loved them. I was surprised. I'll have to try them again and see what all the fuss was about:) I do think next time I'll broil them a few minutes at the end with one last layer of chili sauce-I didn't do that and they looked pretty blah. Letting the chili sauce stick would be more visually appealing.",
