I simply sauteed chicken chunks in a little bit of  olive oil.  I also made a mistake when first making the dish - I didn't read the recipe correctly and I added the bread crumbs to the top of the casserole before baking.  It was still great, though!  The second time I made it (again, preparing the chicken by sauteing), I did put the bread crumbs on the bottom.  My husband liked it better actually with the breadcrumbs on the top.   I can't believe how wonderful the flavor is considering how very simple and basic the ingredient list is.",

I followed the recipe pretty faithfully - I boiled the chicken with celery, seasoned salt and pepper; used the wide egg noodles, etc. The only major differences is that I only used one extra-large chicken breast and added peas for a vegetable (although broccoli or asparagus would have worked well, too).  The crunchy noodles were occasionally a bit tough for my 76-year-old mother, but she loved them anyway! It was a big hit for a belated Mother's Day dinner.",
