I used yellow onion and fresh garlic which I sauteed first while boiling the spinach noodles I used 12oz). For the sour cream and cottage cheese I used 16oz tubs each. I added salt pepper worcestershire sauce and a couple dashes of tobasco sauce. Mixed that then added the cooked noodles. Greased a 9x13 and dumped it in. I topped with parmesan cheese and put it in the oven at 375. It's currently still in the oven but I seem to remember it taking 30-45 minutes. I would not recommend using the crock pot.",

                "reviewBody": "This wasn't bad by any means but with the ingredients I thought it would have much more flavor. To aid with the aforementioned sticking to the sides of the slow cooker I thoroughly sprayed the sides and bottom and sprayed again after I put the pasta and sauce into the slow cooker. Then midway through I opened the lid (a no no I know) and sprayed the sides a bit more. This actually made the sides brown up quite nicely and it was the tastiest part of the casserole in my opinion! It didn't stick whatsoever. We added parmesan on top which helped but next time I would play with the spices I added and perhaps some fresh garlic and onion would help as well as parmesan all added to the sauce. I did make it slightly healthier by using nonfat greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and spraying the pasta with cooking spray rather than mixing with oil. I also used nonfat cottage cheese. I may add fat free cheddar and/or jack cheese to come up with a spin on mac and cheese or perhaps even play with the idea of adding bbq shredded pork and cheddar to the mix. This is a great base to build upon.",

I finished the mixture off with a small can of black chopped olives I had on hand. I combined the sauce mixture in a large frying pan and cooked until everything was melted and mingled.
