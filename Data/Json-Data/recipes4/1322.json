This will need to chill in the refrigerator overnight...it's not something you can chill for a couple of hours & then slice & serve for dessert. Second I am pretty sure that the meringue should be spread out on a jelly roll pan (sometimes thought of as a cookie sheet but it has a rim on all 4 sides). Mine was too thick & didn't firm properly because it was too thick. I also think that the sour cream needs to be decreased to lessen the runniness of the filling (it seeped out a lot!) either that or it needs to be chilled for a bit after spreading the filling but before rolling (which may aid in firming up the meringue as well..I am going to try that next time). I used frozen rapsberries & took the suggestion of the raspberry jelly (adding a bit of raspberry liquer to thin it some) which probably contributed to my problem w/ a runny filling. Even w/ the problems this dessert was sooo good (couldn't have it for dessert because it hadn't set but I did have some for breakfast) that I will keep working on the recipe until I get it down. It just tastes that good!",

I didn't have any parchment paper. So the meringue layer then stuck to the waxed paper making it impossible to roll. I was hesitant about using sour cream -- was going to use Cool Whip instead -- but was very pleased with the sour cream. Mixed with the white chocolate and cream cheese its delicious. In addition to the raspberries on top I used some raspberry jelly which I stirred to make it spreadable. Since I wasn't able to roll the dessert I literally just served it \"as is\" -- right on the waxed paper! The presentation wasn't the best -- but the family didn't mind. We all loved the dessert -- delicious! I will try again this time with parchment paper!",

                "reviewBody": "My husband actually made this because I was at work. I talked him through the recipe and told him what the other reviews had said. He baked the meringue in a jelly roll pan (10x15). I suspect that Rowena had a typo in her instructions and that it should read 10x15 instead of 10x12. He had a little trouble peeling the parchment paper off the meringue after flipping it onto the parchment paper with sugar. One corner broke off but he just use that as the start of the roll so no one knew the difference. I had advised him to let his cream cheese sit out until it reached room temperature before mixing with the sour cream so that the filling would stay smooth. He said that he had no problems rolling it up. I think his success was mostly due to the use of the jelly roll pan and baking it exactly 10 minutes. My guess is that if he had over baked it it would have crumbled when trying to roll it because the edges which were the most done crumbled a little. Plus we followed the advice of another reviewer who said to use parchment paper not wax paper. Since we ate it several hours after he made it he didn't wrap it in plastic wrap. Instead he put it in a 9x13 pan that has a tall lid. Then he chilled it in the freezer for about an hour and then moved it to the fridge until it was served. This is a delicious dessert! We will definitely make this again. I think I will try other berries or mixing berries.",
