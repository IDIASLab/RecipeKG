I had to add extra bullion since there was very little flavor without it. My husband and I both tasted the soup before adding the cream and liked it. After the addition of the cream, my husband didn't care for this and did not eat his soup. This may work better if you plan on pureeing the soup, but I really think it needs a thickener if it isn't pureed. Without it, it's a little on the watery side. The addition of the cream actually detracted from the overall flavor. If I could, I would give the recipe 3.5 stars.",
