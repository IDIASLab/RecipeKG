                "reviewBody": "This is a great starter recipe for chicken stock, although I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a true stock, simply because by definition a stock is made from liquid, veggies and bones\u2026 the internals of the bones producing a richer texture than broth. In addition, stocks are traditionally cooked longer (several hours). In contrast, a broth is an aromatic liquid made by simmering water with meat and veggies for an hour or so.\nThe process of clarifying the liquid is called building a \u201craft\u201d and it\u2019s something we had to perfect within the first few weeks at the Culinary Institute. Rafts can be simply eggs, or they can be a combination of eggs and other ingredients. For example, the rafts we made at the CIA included eggs tomato, onion, leek, celery, etc. Not only did it clear the liquid, in addition the ingredients flavored it. The whole theory behind a raft is that denatured proteins (the ingredients in the raft) attract cooked proteins. Once more thing\u2026 Once a stock is clarified, it changes names to a consomm\u00e9.\nAnd now you know the rest of the story\u2026\n\n",

                "reviewBody": "First off, for your mirepoix you should have 2 parts onion to one part carrots and one part celery.  You should never add salt to a stock since this is just supposed to be a base for soups which will be seasoned with salt when cooked.  Clove??? A general sachet for chicken (white) stock calls for bay leaves, dried thyme, crushed peppercorns, and parsley stems.  Cold water optional????  Never used warm or hot water to start your stock, alway used cold water, you learn that in cooking 101!!  And remember, a chicken stock is made with chicken bones only, no meat!! if you are using meat instead of bones then you are making a broth not a stock.  If you constantly skim off the impurities that float to the surface while cooking, there is no need for this egg technique to clarify your broth.  Also, for the mirepoix, 1 inch chunks is a little too big for chicken stock, you normally use 1 inch piece of mirepoix when making a dark stock like veal stock which is cooked for about 20 hours, for chicken (white stock) you should cut your mirepoix no larger than 1/2 inch to impart more flavor into your stock.   Also, you could also cook the stock longer than the suggested time, doing so will draw out more flavor from the bones and mirepoix.  If you want to make dark chicken stock, simply bake the bones until browned on both sides and carmelize the mirepoix (not the celery, since its mostly water and will stop the carmelization process) before adding to stockpot. Hope this helps!!",

I added a clove of garlic and some peppercorns into the mix.  When the chicken was cooked through I took it out, pulled the meat off and tossed the bones back in for a little while.  The resulting broth is so rich and delicious, it's wonderful!  Since I made quite a lot, I'm freezing it in 4-cup increments.  Boil some noodles and veggies in it, put the pre-cooked chicken back in and it makes such a yummy soup and it has a \"cooked all day\" taste, even though you can make it in about 20 minutes.",
