One rotisserie-sized chicken should not take any longer than 1 1/2 hours, at most.  Also, the temperature will continue to rise with resting.  Feel free to cook the chicken in your normal fashion, the recipe cook times here are obviously on the cautious side!  :)  PS- This recipe can also be used on chicken breasts or pieces, and should make enough to be used more than once, depending on the size of the bird or how many pieces used.",

I did use less sage to make it more all purpose. I only had celery flakes instead of seed. I used a bit less salt, but only because my husband has high blood pressure & we eat very low salt. Thanks for the recipe! I'll be making it often.",

I didn't have all the ingredients (celery seed) but it tasted great. What I did differently...added a little olive oil to the skin and then roasted it at 450 for 15' to crisp the top and then at 350 for the duration which was about an hour and a half. It turned out very moist and very tasty. There were nice juices on the bottom of the pan that would make a righteous gravy. Will definitely do again.",

I have a suggestion for almost any roast chicken- sprinkle the chicken/pieces liberally with ground ginger and/or add some to the other ingredients. It just does something to enhance the flavor even more and you can't really taste the ginger as ginger itself even if the ginger is all you use before the baking. I have been doing this for years. I did this with the Thanksiving turkey this year and our guest said it was the best ever and what did I do to it?? Fantastic.",
