However after I mixed every thing poured onto a my waxed paper lined pans you couldn't see the candy or nuts. I added an additional cup of candy corn and peanuts to help reflect I had added them to begin with. We will make again following the holidays. Thank you.",

Put in a little extra candy because the bags came to a cup or two more than the recipe called for. Now I'm guarding it from the cat because he keeps trying to steal it as it dries.
