After cooking the onions, garlic,..etc, add the clams and stir to mix all the ingredients together, then add the water/flour mixture and stir constantly until the sauce thickens. If you desire a lighter version, then add more cooking water (personally, i like it pretty thick). I always strain and freeze the remaining cooking water, so i can use it later in my stews, soups, etc...). Hope you like it!!",

One modification: I do not add too much water to the pan to steam the clams only a thin layer of water to prevent from burning the bottom of the clams. The clams will start loosing liquid very quickly and this will be enough to make a rich sauce. If you need more liquid then add it after adding the thickener- this way you wll never go wrong with the amount of liquid in the sauce! Thank you for the recipe!",

I think I may have used too much water when I boiled the clams and I put all of that water into the sauce. Next time I will use less water to boil the clams. However... I did save the broth in the freezer for when I make a chowder. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!",
