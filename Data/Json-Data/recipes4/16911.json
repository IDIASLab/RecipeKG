It's not going to knock your socks off with flavor, or impress company, but it is a great budget friendly way to stretch a pound (or even half pound) of ground beef with pantry staples (if your pantry has Ramen) and an aging bell pepper.  If you've got some Ramen you're looking to use, this is definitely worth a try.  THANKS for the recipe!",

Also I had chicken ramen so I used beef bullion instead of the ramen packets. \n\nI will definitely make this again, but I'll probably add some frozen peas just to add more vegetables (or canned corn.)\n\nI don't love pepperoni, but I liked this. Next time, I might use taco seasoning instead of the pepperoni and Mexican cheese blend instead of the mozzarella. So many options!\n\nThis was a great recipe to get me started with a ramen/ground beef combo.",
