I used cider vinegar instead of plain distilled, which made the eggs a nice light \"tea\" color.  I also added about 2 teaspoons of salt and about 1/4 cup of sugar.  Next time I'm going to increase the sugar to about 1/2 cup, will leave out the bay leaf (there's plenty of that in the pickling spice) and maybe add another clove or two of garlic.  A good first effort for me at pickled eggs, and I'm enjoying them (hubby and daughter won't even get close!) :o)!",
