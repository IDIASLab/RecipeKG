I followed the recipe to the letter, except I added a handful of frozen peas (for some color), sub'd a can of cream of mushroom soup for one of the two cans of cream of chicken soup (only had one on hand), and baked in serving-size  casseroles.  The one criticism I have is that it was very watery, so next time, I will use only one can of soup, otherwise, it was pretty tasty. Chicken or turkey should work equally well in this recipe.",

I did not have celery but used carrots (finely chopped), onion, and fresh garlic, minced.  I had four pork chops, bone in, seasoned with salt, pepper, and onion powder and cooked them on low in a skillet.  When they were done, I removed them from the pan and added the butter, carrots, onions and garlic - scraping up the flavorful bits of pork on the bottom of the pan.  After sauteing those I added the half can of corn, a small can of mushrooms, and a half cup of thawed frozen peas to the same skillet.  I used the cream of asparagus per another review even though I had cream of chicken and I am glad I did.  THIS MADE THE RECIPE FOR US! Sour cream was added as recipe suggests but I halved the cheese and used sharp cheddar.  I didn't add any extra salt.  I like salt a lot but the creamed soup and other ingredients added plenty of salty flavor.  I also did not bake this in the oven, just heated everything in the skillet and served with garlic toast.",

I was reading the reviews and thought that 2 cans of soup was a bit much, we are trying to watch our sodium intake.  I ended up modifying the recipe.  I doubled the onion, red pepper and celery and added mushrooms halfway through the saute of the vegetables.  I also added peas when I added the corn (used frozen corn and peas, thawed).  I used No Yolk egg noodles and package said to cook 10 to 12 minutes, I cooked them 9 minutes and used the whole bag.  I didn't add any salt and doubled the ground pepper.  I sprinkled parm cheese on the top before the bread crumbs.  I turned this into two 9x9 dishes and froze one for later since there is just two of us.
