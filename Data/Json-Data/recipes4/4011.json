All the ingredients were the same except I substituted powdered ginger for the fresh ginger and along with the cayenne it was VERY spicy... So I added cream and milk to tone it down so it came out creamy but very good. And instead of baking it I threw in it a wok with chicken and fresh spinach wtih fresh cilantro added at the end. It worked out great considering I improvised last minute but I will definitely do it again so thanks Rina!",
