I had to sub kielbasa, but I can't imagine the recommended sausage could really boost the flavor so significantly improve the flavor of this soup to the 5 stars that the others have suggested.   After prepping the soup as the recipe stated I realized I couldn't serve it to my family \"as is\" (BLAND. BORING), so I scrambled to make adjustments last minute.  Here's the 5 star revised version:  I added a bay leaf and a 3 inch piece of the rind from some parmigiano-reggiano cheese (I saw this in another recipe -- it's awesome!) to the simmering soup.  I also added 1/2 tsp. white pepper, 2 tsp. salt, and a couple good shakes of garlic powder. (In the future I would use fresh garlic sauteed with the shallots.)  I don't see why in the original recipe the kale was blanched before the rest and feel like many of the beneficial nutrients were washed right down the drain. It seems to simply be a time-wasting extra step. If I make this again I will likely cook the kale right in the soup pot...not worrying about the green color that might result.  I simmered the soup with these additions for about 45 minutes which allowed the soup to thicken up perfectly.   Finally, to each serving I gave the option of a splash of cream...which I would HIGHLY recommend.  There's the 5 stars I was hoping for. :)",

The thinner slices became softer and translucent while the diced chunks remained crispy. It added a wonderful flavor and texture variation to an already-wonderful soup.",

A do over for sure.----------------------\n\nRevisited:  Made this soup again...as suggested I did precook the Kale, but I didn't cool it as I was making the soup and allowing it to cook longer then stated.  Again I used Spicy Turkey Italian Sausage.  I took it out of the casings and broke it into small pieces as it was cooking.  as a matter of preference I placed the cooked sausage on paper towel to absorb whatever grease there was (Very little tho)  I then sauteed the shallots in the same pan I did the meat in.  As the directions said, I added a small amount of chicken broth to get the lil bits off the bottom of the pan.  I then added  the meat, shallots, kale and about 6 cups of chicken broth with 2 cans of Great Northern Beans (drained one and drained and rinsed one) in a 4 quart kettle.  My soup cooked about 4 hours and was very tasty again.  With the spicy sausage I needed very little in the way of pepper or salt (I did however add some salt to the Kale as it cooked)",
