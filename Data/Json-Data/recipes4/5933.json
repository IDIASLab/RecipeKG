I cooked on high for 4 hours which turned out to be a little too long as the meat was starting to dry. Will definitely make again and adjust the cooking time. The vegetables were amazing! Next time I'm going to add a couple more carrots (my daughter loves them). Thank you for the recipe!",

And with no garlic cloves I added a liberal amount of prepared crushed garlic. The flavor was still divine and the meat so tender it was almost falling apart. The red onions are definitely an inspired idea. I added the carrots and onions only and served the dish with mashed 'taters. This is a keeper!",
