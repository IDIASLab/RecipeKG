I use duck breasts and add chicken broth to the water when cooking the duck - for extra flavor since there are no bones. I put all the veggies (except okra) in my ninja to quickly chop (more like mince). I use fresh okra and slice thin - my husband didn't like the huge chunks that come frozen. I also use a roux base called Kary's Dry Roux. Zatarins tastes fine but this brand has fewer extra unneeded ingredients. May be difficult to find depending on location! I'm way down south. I also use andouille sausage. If it doesn't have enough flavor with regular smoked sausage try andouille - it's got more louisiana spice. Or could use some tony chacherie's spice blend - you won't need it if you use andouille. Anyhow great recipe! Thank you for sharing!!",
