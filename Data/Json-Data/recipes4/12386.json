So I am sad to admit that I made the following substitutions: I didn't have ground beef so I used 2 1/2 links of leftover italian sausage. I was out of peas so I used a can on garbanzo beans instead. I can't bring myself to use canned spinach so I used 1 box of frozen. I forgot about the pasta until it was too late. So I left it out. Honestly I can't see myself using ground beef and regular peas the next time I make this becasue I was so pleased with the results I got tonight.",
