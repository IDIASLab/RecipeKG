Hope no one cares that I gave myself five stars.\n\nSince submitting this recipe, I've lost a lot of weight and had to adjust this recipe a LOT to accomodate my new diet.  I now spray the skillet with olive oil cooking spray and omit the butter entirely.  I also leave out all but about 2T of water and sprinkle on just enough Italian flavored bread crumbs to thicken it.  (I make my own from the heels of lite bread.)  Finally, I use 2% cheese.  Fat free just doesn't melt the same.  And I often use canadian bacon, instead of regular.\n\nThank you for the nice reviews.  I do know it isn't pretty, but I just love this dish!",

I actually changed it a bit according to what I had on hand - ham instead of bacon, and canned tomatoes instead of fresh but it still turned out great. I used Mexican tomatoes so it had a bit of a kick and if I had to use canned again, I'd pick Italian. But I look forward to trying it again the way it was written. I used the leftovers over my pasta for dinner the next night - kind of like pasta primavera. Can't say enough about this one - it's a keeper!",

I used 1 mammoth zucchini from the farmers market, 2 strips bacon, 2 green onions, 2 cloves garlic, 1/4 C. parmesan cheese and 1/4 C. cheddar cheese.  Browned the bacon, drained most of the grease and added the onions and garlic.  Then added the zucchini.  I let it simmer for a while and I'm really not sure why you would need to add the water at all because my zucchini added so much liquid to the skillet.  I let that bubble for a while to try to release some liquid.  Then added the cheeses and heated through.  All in all a good dish I will make again.  The boyfriend loved it so I give it 5 stars.",
