A couple of things I did was - I cut the carrot pieces into about 2\" chunks.  After I cooked everything and the broth was finished, the carrots were still firm enough to cup into slices (I used large carrots.)  I ended up using this as a base for a vegetarian matzo ball soup where I added fresh made matzo balls (see package directions - very easy) and homemade noodles (on this site) plus the sliced carrots and a little parsley.  My friends gave it an 11 grade out of 10.  This will be a staple for me.  I also pureed the leftover vegetables and added some broth and milk with cheddar cheese.  Next time I will cook up some broccoli, mash it up a bit and add it to this mix.  It makes a great base for a broccoli cheese soup.  Plus, if you've never cooked the garlic like this before, it's wonderful.  I did make some homemade bread and threw in an extra head in the cooking process.  If you squeeze the garlic and add a little butter, and spread it on bread with some fresh grated parmesan, it's YUMMY.  This is such a great recipe because you can do so much when roasting the vegetables.  Oh, and I did add a 1/2 bunch of parsley to the broth when cooking.  ",

I added celery carrots and quartered onions and some rosemary bay leaves and peppercorns. After placing them in the pot I added a little water to the roasting pan to help scrape up some of the bits left in the pan. The broth is so rich and dark it looks almost like beef broth.
