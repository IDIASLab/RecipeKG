However, I make it with several changes without which I don't think it would be that good, hence the four stars.  \n\nFirst off, instead of using two cups of apple juice, I use one cup of apple juice and one cup of broth.  It is still very apple-y with only one cup, so I imagine that it is way too sweet with two (some people may even prefer 1/2 cup of juice and and 1 1/2 cups broth).  \n\nNext, I use tart Granny Smith apples instead of red delicious.  The tartness of the apples is much more suitable for a main dish and works better with the flavors.  \n\nLastly, I also add a sauteed onion and some poultry seasoning (sage and thyme) to the stuffing.  \n\nWith these changes, it is an excellent dish!  Thanks for the recipe.  It was a great starting point for one of my favorite main dishes.",

I'm not sure what seasonings would go with this if I were to add some. Maybe just salt and pepper would do the trick. The chicken tasted great though when eaten in the same bite as the stuffing.
