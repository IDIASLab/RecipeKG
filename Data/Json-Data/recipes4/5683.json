Second I made the marsala sauce by review hunter blake. I actually sauteed the mushrooms and green onions per the recipe and added the marsala chicken broth milk and cornstarch to that. You will need more than a \"pinch\" of cornstarch if you like your sauce a bit thicker as a pinch leaves it very watery. I will make these again. It's a great option for using up your leftover chicken. Also I had a lot of chicken/orzo mix left because I didn't have enough peppers so my son made a wrap out of it.",

We felt this really gave it the extra taste that would have been missing otherwise.\n    To recap , in last step I quickly sauteed the onions and mushrooms and then added 1 c. Chicken broth, 1\\2 c marsala, almost 1 cup heavy cream, and added cornstarch to somewhat thicken. I had initially hoped it would thicken more but the more fluid texture was just fine over the peppers.\nI also used leftover cut up grilled chicken thighs instead of raw breasts.  Because they were already cooked I added them just before the orzo finished cooking in order to heat the meat but not cook it too much more.  I used 4 medium peppers and used up all the filling.  Great recipe for leftover chicken and much easier to cook than other stuffed peppers recipes that I've made.",
