                "reviewBody": "10 seconds on the taffy was spot on. The chocolate chips however too much longer to melt AND they were thick like mud and I had to add veggie oil to think out. With that being said, overall this was a good recipe. You ready for this? My store quite carrying salt water taffy and laffy taffy was all I could find. Cherry and banana it was. Pleasant and wonderful surprise! The cherry made the almonds taste like a chocolate covered cherry (I hate those but if you like them give this a try) and the banana was spot on! Both hubs and me agreed that the banana taffy was excellent in this. If you live in a humid climate like me, I recommend refrigerating the taffy wrapped almonds until the chocolate is ready. Lastly, one almond a person is not what I'd call a serving size. Plan on 2 a person serving 12 and go from there. Tedious but well worth the effort.",
