It needs some heat too but that is easy to add to suit your own tastes. The recipe calls for ground turkey but it just so happens I made this a few days after Thanksgiving so cubed turkey breast is what I used in place of the ground turkey breast. I will add another can of beans when I make this again. Other than that this is perfect!",
