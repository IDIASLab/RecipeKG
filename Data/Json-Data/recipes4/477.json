Nice combination of ingredients. We enjoyed.",

I had read the other reviews and knew that it was dry and added a little extra milk but wow it really is a dry recipe. I should have compensated more and added sour cream or something. I did have a bit of the scrambled egg effect that others described but it wasn't bad. I used butter to saute the onions instead of oil. Thank you.",
