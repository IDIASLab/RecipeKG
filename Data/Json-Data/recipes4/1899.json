I kept the peeling on because we like them better that way. Used cooking spray (not a part of the recipe) on the potatoe slices before coating them but after looking up the true calories and fat in cooking spray and all the other horrible stuff that in it next time will not use. Google how much fat is in cooking spray and you will stay clear of it. They can get away with how much fat and calories is really in cooking spray by making the serving size 1/3 of a second spray which is less than a gram and incrediably unrealistic so they can say zero calories and fat. Has about the same fat content as olive oil which is healthier with Omega 3's and doesn't have all the chemicals thats in cooking spray. Was a real enlightening bit of info for me. Hope this helps others who really care about what goes into their bodies. Anyways thanks you amanda1432 for a great recipe.",
