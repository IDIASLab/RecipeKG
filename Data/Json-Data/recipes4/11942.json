I also chilled it for an hour before kneading it on a floured surface then cutting out the donuts. My family loved them and they were gone in a few hours. ",

I know this is a recipe my boys will enjoy over and over. I used a white cake mix. But I know I will try spice cake and carrot cake mixes. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe. Took only 5 minutes to prepare the batter. After reading the other reviews I would have to say that they were a little oily. I did make a small teaspoon sized one. Having them that small only took about 2 - 3 minutes once the oil was hot. Cook them on medium high. You will want to drain them well. I would put them in a bag of cinnamon sugar and shake well after draining them. I will make this again when wanting to give the boys a quick and easy treat.",

When temperature of oil is too low the batter will absorb the oil. I made these just a few minutes  ago and they were YUMMY. I did add additional flour, 3 eggs and 3/4 cup water as suggested in earlier review.  Thank you for easy recipe for cake donuts!",
