I ended up using almost a cup of melted creamy peanut butter with some rice vinegar and brown sugar and stirred that in.... still spicy but much easier to eat. This also made a very large quantity. Lastly I am no major chef but the prep time an this was about 60-75 minutes.... this is no quick weeknight meal. BUT again thank you so much for posting!",

I knew when it said to boil the water and let them sit for 10 minutes that they were going to be too soft but I did it anyway and they were.
