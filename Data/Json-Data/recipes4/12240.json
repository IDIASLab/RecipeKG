Here's what I discovered: 1) The soup thickens drastically with the addition of the dumplings presumably because of the cumulative residue effect of all the flour from the dumplings... so one can certainly make this soup last longer by adding more water or chicken stock 2) I followed the lead of another reviewer in adding chicken stock. Do note that this will make the soup taste saltier so in using chicken stock adding salt may not be necessary 3) Most soup recipes end up with more servings. With all the labor involved I wish there had been more so it would have lasted longer 4) I forgot that dumplings increase in size as they cook so my first dumplings were a little too big and 5) Rolling the dumplings can be fun but takes a long time if they are kept small. I'm a soup fanatic and this one's a keeper.",

Did not drain off the water but then added chicken broth and one can of evaporated milk and milk in place of water. I put in 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to my dumpling dough. I had some left over smoked keilbasa sausage and diced it up and placed it into the soup as well. This helped out with in the meat eaters in our family.",

I would make the following points and additions, however:\n\n-Make sure that the bacon used is high quality and flavorful. I used plain old supermarket bacon, and in retrospect I should have splurged for the specialty stuff.\n-Substituting broth for water, while unnecessary, will net a fuller-bodied taste in the long run. \n-The dumpling process took a long time for me; if one likes firm potatoes, I would recommend starting the process of cooking the dumplings 5-7 minutes earlier than instructed in the recipe.",

Alterations I made: I used red potatoes Added about 5 stalks of celery 1 can of Corn Substituted the 1 teaspoon of salt added with potatoes for 4 teaspoons of chicken bullion seasoning Added the whole package of bacon While frying up the onion and bacon I added the celery to that. I cooked all this up until everything was caramelized and very crispy. It's best to make sure that it's crispy otherwise it will be too limp and soggy when added to the soup. And while the potatoes were boiling I adding the chicken bullion seasoning. Near the end I added the corn. It took about an 45 minutes after the soup was done cooking for the soup to get nice and thick and more flavorful. The leftovers were great!! 4 stars because I added more to it to make it just right but overall this is a great recipe!",
