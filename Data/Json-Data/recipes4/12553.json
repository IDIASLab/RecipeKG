The egg whites made it extra healthy! this is great! my kids are gobbling them up as I type.. begging for more without syrup! just plain hold in their hands treat!! thanks so much!! they even begged for them for breakfast and dinner yesterday!",

                "reviewBody": "Used this recipe to learn the proportions of ingredients for a whole grain pancake made w/ yogurt.  Since I skipped the cornmeal & replaced w/ add'l whole wheat flour which is more absorbent than cornmeal, it's not surprising that it needed more liquid.  I increased the liquid by 1/4 of the total liquid, but as the batter was still too thick to spread well, it could have used a bit more.  I did use whole eggs, so that added a bit of fat which gave the pancakes a moister texture.  It raised up like crazy, so the baking powder probably could be cut back a bit, which would have made the pancakes denser and moister after cooking.  Next time I plan to use the same amount of baking powder as the amount of baking soda that the recipe calls for (1/2 the original amount), and keep the same amount of baking soda.  I used oat bran instead of the rolled oats.  For people who felt the original recipe had too dry a texture, adding a lot of additional liquid might actually make matters worse since the pancakes will be thinner so be more well done.  A moister texture is achieved by adding a little fat like a Tbsp or 2 of oil or egg yolks, and by using a bit less leavening (baking powder) b/c the liquid won't evaporate as much from a denser cake.  I skipped the spice from the pancakes as I served them w/ spiced applesauce instead of syrup.  Excellent after the changes.",

That's naturally so based on the amount of liquid in this recipe but that should be easily changed according to one's preferance (which is the case for any pancake recipes) and shouldn't be the reason to rate this recipe low. I doubled the amount of skim milk to thin it out and made 9 medalions to share between me my dh and dd. Used cane sugar instead which to me is a healthier option and added some sunflower seeds which came in handy. It turned out to be rather dry but honey or maple syrup should solve that problem. It was like eating pieces of bread. My 3-yr-old absolutely loved it and ate more than I did!",
