What I did was use 2lbs of lean ground chuck, cooked the beef and drained grease, then I put half stick of butter in the pan along with 1 packet of McCormick Au Jus mix and a packet of Ranch dressing mix plus 1/2 tsp of Cayenne Pepper. Mix everything together until meat is all coated, then of course I put it in a 3 qt casserole dish and put a pkg of french fried onions as the nest layer, then of course the vegetables finally topping off with left over garlic smashed red potatoes(skin on) and of course the cheese. My 5 year old son is very picky about what he eats and he could not get enough of this.",

Also added 2cloves of garlic to meat mixture, and some sour cream to the mashed potatoes. Also melted the cheese and then browned it on broil. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow! Tried to take a pic, even downloaded an app, but couldn't get it to work.  So yummy! Highly highly recommended!",

I made the following changes:\n\n* Used 2 lbs ground beef (1 lb really not enough meat)\n* Added a little half and half, sour cream, and parsley to the mashed potatoes\n* Saut\u00e9ed about 1/2 cup of diced raw onion in oil in pan, 5-6 minutes, then added meat\n* Used 1 tsp Better than Bouillon beef rather than a cube\n* Dissolved chicken bouillon cube in 1/4 cup hot water, then mixed with soup mix and beef bouillon before adding to meat\n* Sprinkled a bit of garlic powder on meat\n* Used one 14.5 ounce can of mixed peas and diced carrots, omitted the corn (not a big fan). Seems like the 3 cans of veggies that the recipe calls for would have been too much.\n* Mixed the peas and carrots together with meat in pan after draining\n* Added a few tablespoons of water to meat mixture to moisten it a bit\n* Sprinkled some dollops of butter on top of the mashed potatoes, after the paprika\n\nI used the whole packet of soup mix this time, but might consider reducing it to 1/2 or 3/4 of a packet next time (flavor was almost overpowering with the full packet)",
