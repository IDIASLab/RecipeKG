My husband picked two eggplants from the garden, so I thought this would be a good way to use them up. What drew me to this recipe is, the eggplant is baked and not fried. My husband and I don't care for fried foods. I followed the recipe pretty closly, but I went by another review and baked the eggplant for 7 mins on each side.1 8oz bag of shreeded mozzarella cheese was enough. The pan was pretty full, and i was afraid it wouldn't be cooked enough, so I put it in the oven for 50 mins. It was perfect. My husband loved it. I made a salad and served Italian bread with it. We have enough eggplant for leftovers tomorrow night. Thanks so much for such a great and easy recipe. This will be a keeper in my home.",

This recipe was amazingly simple and very, very good.  The eggplant stayed firm and crisp.  The only changes I made was to bake for 7 minutes each side before assembling (instead of 5) and I used homemade tomato sauce instead of a jarred variety.  Actually, I forgot to peel it too, but it made no difference and didn't detract at all.",

It was absolutely wonderful and I was pressed for time, so I didn't skin the eggplant, nor did I sweat it for (3) hours. I only sweated for (1) hour.  I did follow other suggestions and baked the eggplant at 375 degrees for 15 minutes per side. I wanted them really firm so they wouldn't get soggy sitting in the marinara while baking. And they didn't burn. They were nice and crunchy, and I can't cut slices precisely so some were thicker than others and none of them burnt! I don't know about others, but I needed more marinara sauce than (1) can.  But I like mine saucy to slather on my noodles. I served over angel hair and I'll say it again! I loved it! And this is my first time ever making or trying eggplant Parmesan. But other than the prep instructions I followed this recipe to the T. This is going to in my cook book! To note, I used Sea Salt to sweat them, and I don't like salt and didn't think this tasted salty at all.  It might have been because I used Sea Salt which isn't so \"salty\" tasting.",

After getting one in our CSA my husband decided to give it a second chance and we realized we had everything we needed for this recipe and gave it a shot.  It's delicious!  We only salted ours for about 20 minutes and it wasn't bitter at all.  I didn't have Italian bread crumbs, so I used regular crumbs seasoned with garlic and onion powder, oregano, and parsley.  We had fresh mozzarella so we sliced that as one of the layers and used the parmesan on top.  We also used fresh basil because we got that in our CSA also.  Completely delicious and I already bought another eggplant to recreate the dish sometime later this week.  Thanks for making me an eggplant convert!",

Thank you to the reviewer who explained that male eggplant isn\u2019t bitter like the female eggplant. If the mark at the end of the eggplant is round, it\u2019s female and has more seeds. If the mark is elongated it\u2019s male with less seeds and a sweeter taste. This info saved me tons of time since I didn\u2019t have to salt the eggplant and wait 30 minutes to draw out the bitterness.  I followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception of baking it 12 minutes on each side since I cut my slices on the thicker side.  I served it with garlic bread and a salad. It was a total hit!",

Because I was not sure how they'd react to an eggplant dish which is not typically on our menu and I only had one eggplant I added some pasta to it. I boiled some whole wheat rotini (about half of a box) and layered sauce pasta cheese then sauce eggplant and cheese. I had some leftover from the bread crumbs and Parmesan mixture and I sprinkled that on top. It was delicious fresh and the next day as leftovers too.",
