I am sure that would have made it healthier. It tasted great though! When leaving out the seeds it is probably a good idea to reduce the water a little bit unless you like soupy oatmeal. This is definitely a SOUR oatmeal and if made like the recipe says more on the savory side like the description says. My kids and I like sour things so we enjoyed that sour rhubarb flavor. However at first it was a little too sour and not enough sweet for our tastes so I added double the honey. Although still very sour that made it quite enjoyable. I am sure we will be making it again during rhubarb season.",
