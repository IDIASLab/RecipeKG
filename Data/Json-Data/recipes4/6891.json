I was not sure how this would work in the crock pot, but it worked!  the texture was a bit different that you'd get in the oven, but not bad, merely different.  While this isn't my *favorite* breakfast casserole, it is yummy enough that I'll make again because it's so easy to throw together the night before when we've got overnight guests.

I added salt and pepper to the potatoes. 2. I added cooked ham as well as the bacon. 3. I did not have cheddar cheese so I used mozzarella. 4. I used two cups of milk instead of one. 5. I added spices to the eggs season all and cumin. I let this cook for 10 hours overnight and it came out perfect.",

When I did use the bacon it was the quick cooking kind that goes in the microwave - quick easy and far less messy than bacon splattering all over your stove in a pan!:-) Next time I am going to add some mushrooms - yum!",

I swapped bacon for ham and parsley for dill and didn't spend the time sauteeing the garlic onion and peppers. (It was Christmas Eve! Had to get to bed before Santa arrived!) After reading a lot of the comments and reviews we reduced the milk to 1/2 a cup and only let it cook for 5 hours on low. (That was PLENTY!) While setting an alarm was a bummer if we make it for a brunch starting it when we get up at 5 is perfect timing. SUCCESS! The kids ate it up the husband said it was delish and even I was happy with the taste and texture. I may make it with less tater tots next time and more cheese! Definitely going to try the sausage or bacon version next time! Thank you for sharing this! A new Christmas Morning tradition is born!",
