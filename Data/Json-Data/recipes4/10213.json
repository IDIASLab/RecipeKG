Moist with just the perfect amount of cranberries (I used craisins) Doubled the spices as suggested and also substituted 1/4 cup water for 1/4 cup OJ. I don't have a bread machine, so I dissolved the yeast in the warm water and let it sit, mixed together dry ingredients (EXCEPT 1 cup flour) added the butter (melted) and liquid stuff.  Then I mixed/kneaded in the last cup of flour.  Kneaded about 8 minutes (until elastic-y)and then let rise until it doubled (about 1hr), put in a greased loaf pan and let rise again (mine took about 40-50min to double) and then baked at 400F for 15 min and then reduced to 350F for 25 min (mine is an electric oven and somewhat goofy, so you might need to adjust the baking time)",

My breadmaker doesn't have a Sweet Bread setting but does have a Fruit/Nut setting. That is what I used and it came out underbaked--had to finish it in the oven. The taste is not in the least remarkable. Like Liv-Pup said \"doughy\". I think if I were to make it again I would use the normal setting of my breadmaker. The difference between the two is a matter of degrees but enough to make a difference in this recipe. Will not try again.",
