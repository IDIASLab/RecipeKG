I use water and clam juice here (not chicken broth) to allow the seafood flavor to shine.",

My swing on the recipe is to season it with a bit of Old Bay--just enough to feel that it's there, but not so much as to make it an Old Bay dish.  For seafood, I skip the salmon,and use a dozen medium (26-31-count) peeled and deveined shrimp, a dozen sea scallops, and 1/2 cup lump crab meat.  Also, instead of water, I make my own stock by simmering for 20  minutes the shrimp shells, a teaspoon celery salt,and the top leaves from a bunch of celery.  Basil is good, but I think thyme is better for this dish.  Finally, plate the risotto, sprinkle the tops with good Parmesan cheese and place the plates under the broiler until the edges just begin to brown.",

We used chicken stock instead of water and used this to cook 15 fresh clams in their shell along with the shells from about 10 prawns. We then removed and discarded the shells and added the cooked clams to the canned clams and poured the liquid from the canned clams into the stock. We substituted the saffron and basil for 1 tsp of Old Bay seasoning. We added 2 c. chopped spinach and substituted salmon for 10 prawns and 10 scallops. We added these along with 1 cup grated fresh parmesan cheese with the clams when the risotto was almost ready. Belissimo!",
