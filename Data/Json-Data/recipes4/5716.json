I followed the recipe with the exception of the ginger ale and fresh mushrooms as I didn't have any. I sub'd sparkling soda.... figured it'd be similar! And I bet the yummy mushrooms would make it even better! I served it over buttery mashed potatoes. A keeper for our busy family of 6!!",

I used 4 sirloin steaks and had to replace the ginger ale with cream soda because that was what I had on hand. It came out a bit sweet, but no one noticed except me--I think it was only because I knew I had substituted the cream soda. It was very tender and still had a nice hearty flavor with a gravy consistency, and made a lot. We used the extra gravy over rice. With the substitutions I would rate it 4 stars, but I would definitely make this again with the right ingredients and I think it would be 5 stars.",
