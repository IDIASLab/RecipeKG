We poured and smoothed the caramel with a spoon let it sit for a minute or two then did the same for the chocolate. The peanuts went on right away else the chocolate hardened and was no longer tacky. It was a sticky mess but the end product was way worth it - thus the 5 stars. They are ABSOLUTELY delicious better than store bought. I couldnt imagine doing them alone the caramel and chocolate do get cold/hard and then the pretzels break. It would even be fun to do with kids. But do try them they are awesome and addicting and worthy of many compliments.",

I found that the caramel did a little better when it hardened up just a little - after melting I set it off the heat for a few minutes then used the back of a spoon to smear on the pretzel rods. I didn't have any trouble with the caramel running all over the place once I put them on parchment paper to 'set' before covering with chocolate. I changed up the toppings a little - used chopped roasted peanuts (used my mini food chopper to chop 'em up fine) shredded coconut chopped white chocolate and multi-colored sprinkles. I didn't put all the toppings on one rod - I made a variety. The only thing I didn't like about this recipe is the use of pre-packaged caramels - it took a while to unwrap all those little buggers. However I used what I had left over in my baking stash - next time I think I'll try making caramel from scratch. I had some caramel chocolate and toppings leftover so I threw all the toppings together in with the caramel stirred it up a little rolled into small balls then dropped them in the chocolate. A nice little surprise. Thanks for a great recipe!",
