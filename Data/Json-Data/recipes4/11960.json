I only added 3 teaspoons of salt and will add only 1 tablespoon of garlic next time.  I cooked them on High for 8 hours as called for in the recipe and they came out great!! After they were done cooking,I served a bowl to my husband ( frijoles de la hoya)and then I transferred some of the beans (along with some juice) to a pan and mashed them.  I added a little bit of lard, a tad of milk and some cheese to make them creamy.  The beans were PERFECT without adding lard,milk and cheese...I only added those ingrediants because I am mexican and that is how we have been refrying beans for generations.  I couldn't break the habit :)  I think next time I will try subsituting 2 cups of water for 2 cups of chicken broth.",

I omitted the jalapeno, otherwise they would've been too spicy for my 5 year old.  To clarify, the halved onion completely disintegrates while cooking--I was worried about having a hunk of onion, but it works just the way it's written.  Also, I used 1/2 of the salt--you can always add more salt once they are done, but I didn't.  Once cooked, I poured the beans into a collander and allowed some of the juice to drain off, otherwise they would have been too wet for burritos.  I then mashed them with a potato masher several good times, and they were great.  Next time I make these, I'll try the black bean/pinto bean combo that others have suggested, and I may also add some reduced sodium taco seasoning instead of salt for more flavor.  These are a fabulous substitute for canned refried beans, and I plan on freezing the leftovers for another meal--this does make a lot!",

I also cooked the 2 lbs of beans for 10 hours instead of 8 hours on high.  Mi familia LOVED it!  We will be making our \"refried\" beans this way from now on!  ^_^\n\nAlso forgot to mention, the broth alone is fantastic for those whom participate in long-term water or juice fasting!

Great time saver using the crock pot and a very simple recipe that yeilds fantastic results.  Of course, every cook personalizes a recipe to accomodate their family's taste so here's my changes:  add three slices of bacon, upped the cumin to 1 tsp, chicken broth in place of the water, cut the salt and adjusted to taste at the end.  In place of the water, I used the broth remaining from parboiling chicken for Chicken Enchiladas I from this site (fabulous recipe BTW) consisting of chicken stock, celery, green ortega chilis, garlic, cumin, chili powder, tomato sauce, black peppercorns, oregano and onions.  This gives the beans an absolutely superb flavor!  It's wonderful without my stock, but using it gives this recipe an added boost.",
