                "reviewBody": "I gave this only three stars because while I enjoyed it... it didn't knock my socks off like other gumbos I've had in the past. Here are some things I'd like to note about this recipe: 1. This recipe has okra in it which is actually considered a thickening agent. (Not just a vegetable.) File (Fee-lay) powder is supposed to be a replacement for okra in the off season. It isn't bad that this recipe has both... just something I thought I'd note. BTW I'm no expert on gumbo I just read this info on several websites while trying to find a recipe. 2. You can't really make the vegetables \"golden brown\" as the recipe states. This might be obvious to some but I found it irritating. You just cook the veggies until they're soft or when the onions are all translucent. 3. I prefer a darker roux but I'm not sure how to make it darker. Some of the other recipes call for 2 cups of beef broth and only 4 of chicken. Maybe this makes the broth darker the way I liked it when I had it before. 3. Part of what I like about traditional gumbo is that the chicken is usually on the bone and there are still tails on the shrimp... I recommend buying a big bag of wings and using that in the recipe instead of boneless thighs. (Which I assume is what the recipe wanted but didn't clarify.) Mini drumsticks would be good too. 4. If you're worried about not having enough fat for the roux... don't drain the sausage fat and just add a little more flour. It says 1/4 cup of flour but you can just eyeball",
