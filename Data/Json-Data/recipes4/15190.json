I also used 1 jalapeno pepper as I am kind of a wimp when it comes to spice level. I could have handled more... and hubby wanted a LOT more! That's what's nice is that you can adjust this recipe to your own liking by the type of pepper you use and how much. A couple of criticisms - the cooking time of the asparagus is way off. I boiled mine for 3-4 minutes until they were crisp/tender (mine were fairly thin about like a pencil). Even for extremely thick asparagus - 12 minutes is too long. I also only cooked the chicken mixture for about 20 minutes. I think 45 minutes would have turned the mango and tomatoes to mush. Just my opinion. Overall good dish. I'd make again.",

I had all the ingredients in different forms. but the tomato mango onion spice mix rocks! I had chicken thighs. removed skin left bone in. Had two ready to eat mangos sliced and diced those. ended up having to make my own curry powder because I only had a teaspoon full but enough of the other ingredients to make 1/4 cup curry powder..Had leftover rice from last night and asparagus that needed to be cooked. Rubbed the curry powder on the chicken saut\u00e9ed with the onions (I also added bell peppers) mixed tomatoes and mangoes together and poured over stewing chicken. A couple drops of sriacha was good too. I was looking for flavors to use what I had from leftovers and this did it - only had to open a can of tomatoes. Point is - good flavor combination easy to prepare if you have everything. (I found this by doing the ingredient search knowing I had mangos and asparagus)",
