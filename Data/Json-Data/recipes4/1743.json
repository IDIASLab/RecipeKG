I really disliked it so now I never go near it BUT my Scottish hubby and my kids all love the stuff therefore I make it several times a year. Even if I don't like what I'm making I always taste before serving and I must admit that this was really delicious!! I did the opposite of what the recipe stated; instead of grilling the sausage after coming out of the slow cooker I grilled the brats before. I used a lot of peppers and added more beer. The sauce was very tastey and the bratwurst was amazingly tender and REALLY flavorful. The family loved this recipe and I thank you!",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent bratwurst! I must admit I was a bit skeptical at first. Brats in the slow cooker???? Boy was I wrong!!! Slow cooking makes them fork tender (and deelicious!). Made half the recipe so that my dad would have something to eat when he came to my house to work on a bathroom remodeling project. Because I didn't know when he'd show up (and I was working all day) I made everything the night before. I pretty much followed the directions to a T except for a couple of minor changes. I followed Linda Mclean's suggestion of grilling/basting the brats prior to slow cooking (I used an indoor grill for this). Instead of half an onion and half each of green and red peppers I used an entire sweet onion and 2 medium-sized green peppers. Also in order to completely cover the brats/onions/peppers I used 2 (12 oz.) bottles of Michelob Amber Bock (the cheapest beer I could find - you don't need anything fancy here just a dark beer for flavor). Cooked on low for 4 hours but 5 would have been OK too. My house smelled so good! Since I had left-overs I brought some to work with me. When warmed up in the microwave the scent of beer permeated the air (yum!!!). For those who couldn't find honey mustard BBQ sauce look for Kraft brand (they make it). Overall this is a great easy recipe that me and my dad both really enjoyed. I'll have to make this for my bf too. Thanks for sharing: )",
