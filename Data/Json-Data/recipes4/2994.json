It tastes much better and it's just as easy to grill it. I used Cheddar cheese instead of American and added a nice thick slice of tomato with a bit of salt and pepper. For the Russian dressing I used \"Chilled Russian Dressing\" from this site. All this sandwich need was a dill pickle and a side of chips to take it over the top. Great recipe!",
