                "reviewBody": "This recipe really is superlative. Here's how I make the curry paste without a blender:  Grate an onion (this is easier and takes less time than you'd expect). Grind two tablespoons of black pepper (don't reduce the black pepper--it's too distinctive to the recipe's flavor). Cook the onion on medium for two minutes. Then add the ground black pepper and cook for four minutes. Then add the coriander and curry powder (I used two tablespoons in place of the curry leaves) and cook for one more minute. Throughout this process, add up to one cup of water as needed to keep things from sticking to the pan.  After that, proceed with the recipe as written. In order to reduce spiciness, I cut the cayenne pepper in half. I'm also guessing (although I don't know) that two tablespoons of curry powder is less hot than a half cup of curry leaves. With these reductions, the recipe was still almost too spicy for my taste buds, so many might want to go down to a tablespoon of curry powder and half tablespoon of cayenne.  Adding spinach at the end of the simmering process worked pretty well for me as a way to add some vegetable to the recipe.",

This recipe had a good flavor but the spiciness was just too much even after I reduced the amount of Cayenne Pepper to 1.5 Tbsp. and the Salt to only 1.5 tsp.

In reading the other comments thought I'd share that curry powder which is a blend of many spices is NOT the same as curry leaf (which is well a leaf). If you use curry powder you will get a different flavour than what is intended in the orginial recipe (not bad just different - and likely more spicy). Also if you do find it too spicy you can stir some plain yogurt in to the curry to tone it down. Overall very yummy (with curry leaf OR curry powder)!",
