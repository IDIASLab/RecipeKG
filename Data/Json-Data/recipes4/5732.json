We followed this recipe closely only using dijon mustard and adding a good amount of Stacey's Hamburger Seasoning which is also from this site. When we started mixing the meat loaf together it was VERY wet. Like \"how is this going to hold together\" wet. We added another half cup of bread crumbs to hold it together. I used my Perfect Meatloaf Pan to make this--it was PACKED. I did follow the directions to sprinkle the french fried onions over the meat loaf but I was worried about how those onions would stick to the top with the meat loaf halfway cooked. What I did was spread a good amount of ketchup over the top of the meat loaf then sprinkle the french fried onions over the ketchup. This did take two hours to bake in the Perfect Meatloaf Pan total. This did make a good meat loaf with a good amount of both bacon and cheese. I'm glad I added the additional spice mixture because I think it would have been bland without it. I wouldn't have thought that adding a minimal amount of mayonnaise would make a difference but it really does. I served this with garlic dills Meme's Mashed Potatoes (Southern Plate recipe) and Cajun Buttered Corn.",

Due to dietary needs in our family I had to make the following changes: used low sodium turkey bacon a 19 oz. pkg. of ground turkey an 8 oz. pkg. of non-dairy cheddar cheese Egg Beaters and omitted the onions. This meatloaf was so moist and flavorful. Even my ultra picky 10 year old had seconds. Thanks for this recipe!",

This meatloaf will occasionally make the rotation of \"staple\" meals in our household. I actually thinked we liked it better reheated on the second day as the bacon flavour seemed to meld more. The only things I did a little differently; I added only 1 egg based on another reviewer's suggestion that the meatloaf was too mushy (but I will add the second egg next time) and instead of mixing the cheese into the loaf I placed 3/4 of the meat mixture in the meatloaf pan then layered all the called for cheese (sliced into 1/4 inch slices rather than shredded) on top then topped with the remaining 1/4 meat mixure. We ended up with a gooey cheese \"middle\" that was yummy!",

I also needed to add more breadcrumbs than called for. While this didn't taste 'just like' a bacon cheeseburger, it was very flavorful, moist and yummy! We all enjoyed it, and I will def be making it again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",
