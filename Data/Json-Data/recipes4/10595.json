I used half the mozzarella ham and butter and found this to be a bit too rich for my tastes - I would probably skip the caramelizing step and just plop those onions on the very top to dry-roast when it baked. I found this pizza to be slightly overdone at 15 minutes using 425 temp. Thank you for sharing your recipe this was a great new way to use up Easter ham!",

I was looking for a quicker recipe so I used refrigerated pizza dough instead. The bbq sauce I used was raspberry chipotle and I just put however much I wanted rather than sticking with any measurements. Lastly the cheese I used was Fontina (it was on sale!) instead of Gouda still mixed with the mozzarella cheese. With all of these alterations...it was magnificent!! Will definitely make again:)",
