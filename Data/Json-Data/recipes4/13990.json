I found this recipe easy to use and very tasty.  I made it to accompany collards, corn bread, benne wafers, and Carolina Gold rice for good luck and wealth in the new year (not bad for a Yankee boy).  I would add a few pointers.  In the South, neck bones are a preferred addition as they have tasty meat on them.  I have also used hocks or hog jowls although the latter can be fatty and should be discarded midway through the cooking.  I would not use a bone from a sweet ham such as \"Honey Baked\" as they do not have the same flavor.    I also add a couple of diced tomatoes at the end of the cooking for color and interest.  They should be cooked briefly and not allowed to boil down.  This time, I misjudged the salt and added too much.  To counteract the effects, I added a couple of red potatoes to the pot cut in thin medallions.  They absorbed the extra salt.  I removed them before they became too soft and, not wanting to waste them, put them on a plate.  They were delicioius, espeically with the Hoppin John on top!!! This would be a great alternative for those who do not like rice.",

If you don't have a ham bone this isn't going to come out very well and it's not going to be the recipe's fault. This is delicious if you make it according to the directions.
