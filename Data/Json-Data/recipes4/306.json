                "reviewBody": "Yeah Suzie for submitting this recipe!!! I use this recipe every year for my kids' fall fun day. I melt the caramels in a 4 C pyrex cup, so that the apple fits down in the cup. This is the easiest way to dip that I have found (no wasted caramel). I give each child a square of wax paper and have them butter the square. Then with adult help ( the caramel needs to cool a little) I let them decorate the apples from a selection of toppings (candy corn, m&ms, halloween sprinkles, cookie crumbs and any other small candies I can find.). This is certainly the highlight of the party. Always remember to have extra candy... It often gets eaten before the apples can be decorated! Once the apple is decorated, the buttered square can be wrapped up around the apple a little loosely, than tied. It's the perfect way to send them home with the kids. A pre-made tag with the child's name makes it an easy way to distinguish who's apple is who's once you have them in the fridge to harden. (Note: Even when an adult makes the apple, they are not always the prettiest apples, they certainly do not look like the expensive apples that they sell in the upscale candy stores... There must be a trade trick to those apples:)",

                "reviewBody": "Things you need to know!  1) DO NOT wrap your apples in any type of clinging wrap. Even after they've firmed up. It will stick.  Serve without wrap or you could try to loosely wrap with waxpaper.  2) Run a knife edge at the bottom of the apple to get all the excess caramel off. It doesn't hurt the look of the apple.  3) Do have a deep dish of sprinkles or other crunched up candy to set the apple in while you are dipping your next apple.  Helped to contain the caramel and kept the apples upright. 4) Apples need to have wax removed by dipping in boiling water for a second or just purchase non waxed from your local farmer.  5) apples should be very cold to help set caramel.   6) You can break fork head or spoon head off plasticwear to create a nice stick to stick in your apple.  7)  Have your apples ready with the stick in before you melt your caramel.  8) If you're doing a lot of apples, try and buy caramel in a large serving size as opposed to unwrapping 300 individual cubes. UGH! 9) Only melt the 14 oz at a time in the microwave. 1 minute, stir well, then 30 second - stir well intervals. 10) I used my pampered chef 8 cup measuring bowl. It was great. 11) Spray the waxpaper with cooking oil.  Recipe was very yummy with cameo apples, but the directions were lacking!  Have fun.",

I followed the advice of other raters, rolling the waxy apples in boiling water, wiping them down, putting the Popsicle sticks in them, then putting them in the freezer for 15 minutes.  I microwaved the caramel and milk for 2 minutes and waited 5 minutes before rolling the apples in it.  I found that if you keep spinning the apple over top the dish, after applying caramel, the caramel will, instead of dripping off, roll back over itself and harden as it cools.  Do this before rolling in chocolate chips, or the chocolate will melt!  I also buttered small squares of wax paper to set the apples on in the fridge, this worked out great!  I'm the WORST cook in the world, so if I can do this, anybody can!",
