First, I seasoned the flour with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders, parsley, and oregano prior to dredging to give the meat some more flavor.  I also added some minced garlic to the oil for a few minutes before putting the meat in.  Then, I doubled the amount of broth and used 48 ounces of beef gravy in place of the red wine.  I also used red potatoes instead of celery.  There was enough liquid in the pot to completely cover the entire meal.  It simmered for 2.5 hours and it was delicious!  The meat just fell apart and the potatoes and carrots had an amazing flavor!  I served it with a side of fresh green beans and french bread and this meal just disappeared!  This will be added to my permanent cookbook!  5 stars!!",

During the searing process, I placed the onions, garlic and a tablespoon of gravy master underneath the roast and then seared all sides.  I substituted 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar  (which acts as a natural meat tenderizer) during the searing process, for the wine and excluded the berries.  Also, I added the fresh vegetables (baby carrots, sugar snap peas and new potatoes) about an hour before serving- anything earlier and they turned too mushy for my taste.  I added fresh mushrooms to the mix and I used olive oil because it is the healthiest of all the oils. Very good I gave this 5 stars! ",

My past experiences with beef, in general, have ranged from the laughable to the disasterous, but this recipe has changed all that.  This is THE recipe that will benchmark my beef cookery.  It was tender, flavorful, moist.  I did season simply the flour with salt, pepper, garlic powder before dredging the beef; browned it in a cast iron skillet, added the wine (cabernet sauvignon), and let it simmer for maybe 10 minute or so before adding it all to my electric fry pan with the remaining ingredients.  I tasted the broth, thought it lacked \"a little something\" and decided to add 1/2 tsp of sugar.  That, for me, was the missing ingredient, and now the flavors were a melody upon the tongue, sweet, salty, tart.  Linda, thank you SOOOO much for this submission.  There shall be no other pot roast recipe for me.  This one is it!",
