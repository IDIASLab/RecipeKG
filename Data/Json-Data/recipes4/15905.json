We made this with some very minor changes: I am very finicky about tomatoes so I excluded the stewed tomatoes (did keep tomato sauce though) and instead of beef bouillon granules I used a product called \"Better than Bouillon\" that is more like a paste. Browned the beef as instructed and kept all the lovely browning bits in the soup by pouring in the beef stock and stirring quickly to deglaze the pan. All other instructions followed per recipe. Thank you for this delicious recipe!!",
