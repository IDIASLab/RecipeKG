Also I have never liked recipes that say 2 potatoes or 4 carrots. I prefer defined measurements like a half cup or 6 oz or whatever. That being said this recipe was very good. I went to the farmer's market and bought about 7 large carrots (just over 2 pounds - they were LARGE carrots) and I think it could have used more. So my only recommendation for this recipe - don't skimp on the carrots the recipe makes a lot of sauce.Next time I will try at least 3 or maybe 4 pounds of carrots.",
