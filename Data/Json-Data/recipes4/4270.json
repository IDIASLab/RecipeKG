My kids didn't care for it but that meant there was more for me the next day. The crusty bread is a must have with this dish to sop up all those juices cooksforfourty is absolutely right. And you know I think this was even better the next day if that was possible. So simple and so comforting. Thank you SO much for sharing.",

Adding one more can of beans would help round it out a bit and maybe reduce the chicken to 1 1/2 lbs. I substituted 1 tsp. dried thyme for the parsley. At 5 hours the chicken was overcooked but the cassoulet wasn't thickened yet. Good flavor and easy to make.",

Also I started out with dry beans rather than canned which gave me a lot more control over the end flavor. I used beef broth chicken broth and white wine in equal parts to cook my beans in. Then I added 3 baby leeks finely chopped in place of half of the onion and added 1/2 TBSP of thyme. It was amazingly delicious! Cassoulet is one of those dishes that everyone has their own recipe for so I think this recipe is more to let people know that it can be made in a slow cooker and give us the times and ratios which I appreciate greatly. As far as the \"dryness\" others complained of cassoulet isn't soup. This is the texture it's supposed to be. Thanks so much cooks4forty for this innovative and unusually healthful take on cassoulet.",
