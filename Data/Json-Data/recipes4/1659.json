Soft meringue is made with only a small amount of sugar and is used as a topping for pies and cakes. The more sugar in the recipe the crisper the cookie will be.  If you cut too far back on the sugar the cookies will be more like marshmallows.  Hope this helps clear up the sugar debate.",

I used 1 tsp vanilla extract and increased sugar by 1/4 cup to make up for the added liquid.  I also set my oven to 185, instead of putting a spoon in the door.  It worked great.  Next time I will definitely add a different flavor or chocolate chips! Also,  I used parchment paper on the pan instead of butter and flour. This is a much better way to go because they fall right off the paper and you have no residue on the bottom of the cookie.",

The only thing that I did differently was that I scraped half of a vanilla bean into the egg whites when they reached the stiff peak stage.  (If you add liquid vanilla extract, you will have to up the sugar content, as the extra liquid WILL affect the outcome of the cookies.)  As many former reviewers have noted, the egg whites take a good 15-20 minutes to reach the stiff peak stage with an electric mixer.  (My KitchenAid Pro 600 took about 16-17 minutes.)  Next time, I'm going to try folding some toasted coconut into the finished mixture.",

Take a papertowel and about 1 tsp of white distilled vinegar and wipe your stainless bowl with it.  This makes sure there are no oils that will interfere with your egg whites.  Further, I always add about 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  It doesn't change the taste and it makes the whites stiffen up quickly, especially if you don't have time to let the egg whites come completely to room temp.  After the egg whites were completely stiff, I added a dash of cinnamon and butter extract.  I topped them with mini-morsels and made them smaller so that they cook faster.  Hope this helps!  Great recipe and super tasty meringues!",

I don't understand all the great reviews and wonderful results people supposedly got with this recipe.  My meringue NEVER got past the stage where it looked like melted marshmallow creme.  I let it whip in my Kitchenaid for about 15 minutes and watched it the entire time, so I know I didn't \"over-beat\" it.  I added the sugar about 2 Tbs at a time, letting each addition fully blend in before adding more.  There was no way I could pipe this into anything but a puddle on the baking sheet, so I ended up using the \"Peppermint Meringues\" recipe instead, omitting the crushed candy canes.  That recipe has cream of tartar in it, which I think really is necessary for getting the meringue nice and stiff (every lemon meringue pie recipe I've ever made called for cream of tartar in the meringue).",

                "reviewBody": "Tips for those who are having problems with these falling flat: meringues are very delicate and almost anything can go wrong with them. It is possible that you are either under-whipping them, or whipping them too much. If you over-whip something, you can make it fall flat by whipping the air back out of it. Conversely, if you don't have enough air it won't stay tall.  A few tips on meringues: *If you have ANY egg yolk, throw it out and start over. It will ruin the structure of the meringue. *Before you add the sugar it's better to be safe than sorry; make sure that your meringue is stiff at the very least, and I prefer to whip mine just before there are stiff peaks forming. (To test this, take a utensil and stick it in the mixture, then draw it out forming a little peak or tail; if it sticks up, it is a stiff peak, if it droops over you may want to consider whipping it more.) *You can also tell how stiff the mixture is by whether the mixture fills itself back out if you part it in the middle. Your mixture should separate and stay separate. *You do not want to have glossy peaks before you add the sugar. You have a greater potential to ruin it if you get to the shiny/satin stage before you add anything. *Oils will ruin the mixture, so be careful if adding flavorants or colors. *Add the sugar VERY slowly. So slowly it hurts. Never dump anything you add, including flavors. *Lift the tip of the pastry bag up and away when piping, don't smash it down in!  Hope this helps!",
