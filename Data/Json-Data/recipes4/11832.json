Once everything was mixed together and boiling I trasferred it to the oven to stop the rice sticking to the bottom of the pot. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!",

It was bland and was missing a whole lot of veggies. I use corn fresh off the cob, squash, fresh green beans, and way more seasonings. Also the key ingredient in Albondigas is rice in the meatballs with 1-2 eggs mixed in. You need tomatoes boiled and crushed in the broth. Oh and Garlic. I tried this just out of curiosity and was amused at best. Sorry.",

Cooking the meatballs in the broth adds so much to the flavor of this soup. Be sure to toss in mucho cilantro when you ladle this up. Wow. So simple and so good!!",
