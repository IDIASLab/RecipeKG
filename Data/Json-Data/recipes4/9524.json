It is an art to get just the right amount of filling AND have them stay sealed. A tiny bit of water on the edge helps. Also I do not use the glaze I gently roll them in powder sugar instead while they are still warm. I have discovered that they are too fragile for hot humid summer days of North Georgia. They are usually fine in December though.",
