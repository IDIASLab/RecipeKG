The one thing I would suggest, make sure you have sweet potatoes, not yams.  Yams (orange) make it sweeter than it needs to.  The sweet potatoes (yellow) have a less sweet taste to them.  You can also slice them leaving the skins on and place them on top to cook.  They stay togethe much better and the skins can be easily taken off before eating (though they actually taste pretty good).",
