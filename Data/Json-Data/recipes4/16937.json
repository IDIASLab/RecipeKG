I am going to make this recipe again because time got away from me on checking the pork chops. I would suggest checking the pork chops at 40-45 minutes to see if the meat is at 145\u00ba.  I unfortunately overcooked my pork chops. So, I was a bit disappointed in myself.  Forgive me, rev'd up chef. I will try again because I think this recipe is probably excellent when rev'd up chef made it.  My husband couldn't say enough about the rice. A good recipe on a cold night!",

                "reviewBody": "This was really great and adaptable!  I used \"Better than bouillon\" to make my broth.  Added chopped green bell pepper with onion to saute, which I topped the chops with before covering with foil.  Seasoned chops lightly with ground pepper, garlic and just used a smidgen of the seasoned salt.  I sprayed my dish lightly with cooking spray.  I had 5 thin bone-in chops.  Baked at 375 for 30 minutes then cut the heat back to 325 the last 15 minutes; let sit covered for 5 minutes after removing from oven.  The rice absorbed the beef flavor and was cooked perfectly.  We loved it.  I think the secret to cooking this is to make sure the broth is boiling before adding to baking dish with the rice and seasoning your chops to your preference.  Just don't add too much salt as chops and bouillon are naturally salty. I agree with another reviewer that if you are using thin chops, this will probably serve 3-4 adults instead of 6; my husband had 2 chops.",

I cooked the sliced onion removed it to a plate and then saut\u00e9ed 1 C. Brown rice until it turned white. Then I stirred in 1/2 a bay leaf 1 scant tsp. Salt 1 tsp. Dried parsley 4 whole black peppercorns and? tsp ground thyme and spread the rice in a baking dish. I heated 2 1/4 C Chicken bouillion (powdered plus water) in the microwave while I browned the seasoned pork chops. I moved the pork chops on top of the rice and added the onions. Then I poured in the nearly boiling bouillion being careful to keep the rice flat and under the pork chops and onions. I baked this covered dish for 70 minutes. My husband loved it. Next time we may try adding Cajun spice on the chops for more zing but this was a dry run for a meal for a family with young children.",

Yes, I kept it covered with foil.\nB)  The meat needed much more seasoning than called for.  If I make it again, I will add more herbs and some paprika\nC)The rice was bland.
