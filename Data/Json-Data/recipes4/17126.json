I also subbed thickened milk for the cream soup and it worked just fine. My turkey had been seasoned with oregano and basil so after it was baked I sprinkled some parmesan. altogether a really great winter casserole. Based on another review I raised the temperature to 400 and it baked in about an hour and fifteen minutes.",
