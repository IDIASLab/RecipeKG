Your fish will be shrivelled and dry if you do this, unless you have a very very thick cut of fish.\n\nFor a 1in cut of fish. 15 minutes at 350 is enough. Remember that your fish will continue to cook once you take it out of the oven. And you'll most likely want to let your fish cool down for about 5 minutes before you cut into the package.",

The hardest thing to do is to judge when it's done, due to the variations in size of filets.  Mine were a little more than 1 inch thick in the largest part, and alas, 20 minutes was a tad too long.  They were still edible, and we enjoyed the combination of flavors.  Thanks for the idea!",
