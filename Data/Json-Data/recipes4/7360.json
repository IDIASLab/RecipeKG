Only thing is i used sea salt because chicken can be bland and a little of cayenne pepper for some added spiciness! And every 30 minutes I opened the oven and based the chicken with the juices that was at the bottom of my glass dish to keep the chicken moist and flavorful.",

I used a total of 15 drumsticks and approximately 10 thighs (I have a big eating family and we LOVE leftovers)! I just rubbed a little olive oil over each piece of chicken then seasoned with kosher salt and some black pepper. Mixed approx.. 1/3 cup each of basil and oregano a bit of garlic powder since I added approx.. 10 cloves of fresh garlic over chicken before baking. Added just a bit of salt and pepper to the spice mix and a bit of adobe over chicken pieces. Cut approx.. 5 lemons in quarters squeezed over chicken in my roasting pan which was coated with a pad of melted butter and threw the remainder of the lemons in the pan. Placed roasting pan in oven at 350 degrees for approx.. 1 hr. And then added about 8 potatoes cut in wedges which were dredged in remainder of spice mix and lemon. Since I had so much chicken and potatoes I baked for approximately 1 more hour basting occasionally and re-positioning chicken/potatoes so everything got browned and crispy. Served with steamed brussel sprouts and my entire family from 10-55 years LOVED IT! Most of them had 3 helpings! Thanks so much for the recipe it was FABULOUS! Next time I will add some Portobello mushrooms. Bon App\u00e9tit",

Next time I think I will add a tad bit more garlic and maybe try onion as well. To me this craves to be made and served with mash potatoes and veggie of your choice.

For 12 chicken legs, I lightly coat with olive oil and use half the amount of seasoning and lemon called for, which makes it perfect for us.  When I have no lemons, bottled lemon juice works well. I tried it with potatoes, but much prefer to cook the potatoes and chicken separately in shallow baking pans and baste the potatoes with some of the drippings each time I baste the chicken. One time I  had to leave these in the oven for an extra hour after they had reached temp, so I turned the oven to 180 and let them sit and they were so good, I do it this way whenever I have the time.",
