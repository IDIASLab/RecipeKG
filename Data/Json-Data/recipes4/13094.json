I also couldn't find asadero cheese so I used 4-cheese fiesta blend shreds sprinkled on top. I added the tomato sauce mixed with some of the enchilada sauce (as per suggested in the \"cook's tips\") to the top as well. I also kicked up the spices quite a bit. Good basis but I think it could be better with a little more tweaking like adding more sauce and cheese to the meat mixture. I will definitely make it again.",

I used instant white rice!! I didn't do the pre-baking of the peppers I blanced them in water(that's how we do our green peppers so that's what I did) I didn't have a poblano pepper so I used two serrano chiles and I just chopped them up and with seeds and all and threw them in with the ground beef and onions. I couldn't find asadero cheese so I used quessadilla cheese. I didn't melt it I just placed some on top of each pepper. YUMMY! I think I might try the sauce that the footnote says to do next time. I would make this again.",
