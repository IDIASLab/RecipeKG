The texture was not right to eat as a soup with nothing but shredded meat and broth so I served it over noodles. In the future I would recommend adding some veggies and additional seasonings - onions and garlic would be a must I would also suggest either mushrooms whole tomatoes maybe even zucchini or carrots. It definitely needed something more than what it had. I loved the cooking time and the directions though - so I will experiment with this in the future.",
