I used 6 medium sized potatoes sliced in the food processor.  After saut\u00e9ing pork chops in olive oil, I sprinkled with a season salt.  It doesn't matter if it\u2019s a season salt or some sort of rub, just put a spice on it.  Then I took it out of my pan and added the onions with 2 cloves of garlic, sprinkled with paprika and pepper and saut\u00e9ed. I bet you could increase the onion a bit. I didn't because of the kids.   Don't add salt.  I did one time and it was too salty.  At this point I added the soup and 1/2 of cup of milk only.  Even with six medium sized potatoes, this was enough fluid.  Mix this up, add the potatoes and pour over pork chops that are in my 13 x 9 rectangle stone; cover with foil the first 30 min. and then remove foil, top with 2 cups cheese and sprinkle with French-fried onions and bake 30 more minutes.  I think the key to this recipe is thin chops, covering the dish.  Also, instead of the spices you could probably just ad a can of golden mushroom soup.",

Then I used about a cup of chopped onion.  I sliced up 3 boneless porkchops I had and then browned them in olive oil and garlic with lots of fresh ground pepper & garlic salt, took them out, and then threw the potatoes and onions in next, again adding pepper & salt.  I put the potatoes & onions on the bottom of the casserole dish then the pork, then the soup mixture.  Covered with foil, baked for 30 min, added more garlic salt, salt, pepper & a bit of cayenne pepper, and the cheese, recovered and baked for 25 more min.  Delish!  My husband loved it :)  ",

Skipped the milk.  Just wasn't necessary.  I placed the chops in a casserole dish and dumped the potato mixture on top.

I used 1\" boneless pork chops and covered the dish for the first thirty minutes. It does seem to be very important to season the potatoes and meat. I also used the cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic instead of plain. Good move! I haven't tried it with this recipe but I know this will work based on a similar recipe: For variation and some spice use a jerk rub on the pork or marinate in a jerk marinade before searing. You may also add 1 to 2 tablespoons of Marsala wine to the soup mix(depending on your taste). Instead of chopping the onions slice them. It provides a good presentation and kids can remove them easier if they want. The jerk seasoning will add some spice but mostly flavor since the soup will take care of a lot of the heat from the jerk rub.",
