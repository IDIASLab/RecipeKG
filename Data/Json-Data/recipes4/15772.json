We don't care for bean sprouts so I used celery for the crunch.  Because I didn't use the noodles the sauce didn't self thicken so I mixed a half tsp of cornstarch in cold water and stirred that in.  The flavors blended perfectly and my son said no more take out.  Thanks, Ms Kingsley!",

I did make minor changes to my liking such as adding extra garlic and ginger for bold flavors along with assorted vegetables (carrots, bell pepper, broccoli, snap peas, and mushrooms). I also added half a teaspoon of sugar to bind the taste along with dash of red chili flakes for some kick. I tasted just like what you get from the take out and will continue to make more.",
