I used two cups all purpose flour so I added 1 Tb baking powder and 1 tsp salt to make it self rising.  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  I used miller light since it's the cheapest stuff we have on hand.  They turned out nicely golden and lightly crisp, we loved it.  Especially since our George Forman waffle grill has a hard time cooking waffles well.  Very easy recipe and will try it again.",

I used a regular beer the first go around and after that cheap beer purchased for the recipe always warm beer though I think that helps with it being fluffy. Super yum!

Using a brand new waffle maker of unexplored abilities the outsides were nice and crisp and the insides were soft and fluffy. I got ten 4 x 4 Belgian style waffles using slightly more than 1/4 cup per waffle. Textures inside and out were perfect - this is without beating the egg whites and halving the butter. I think anything Belgian/white/wheat/lighter/not things college kids drink would be tasty in this waffle. You could definitely smell the beer as they were cooking and the flavor came through a bit but not so much as to be overwhelming.",
