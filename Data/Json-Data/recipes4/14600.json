I put in flavorful ingredients, but the slow cooking process seems to homongenize everything and the liquid thins out the flavor.  That did not happen with this recipe.  The gravy was thick and rich and highly seasoned.  I was very hesitant to use all those mixes, but I had them in the pantry (some for quite awhile) and I needed to use them up or throw them away.  My husband had two helpings and proclaimed it \"Good stuff!\"  Thank you so much for the post, keylimeone, this was great!",

I was skeptical as others about the seasoning combinations but it was without a doubt top notch. The only addition I made was a little red cooking wine over the onions in the bottom and I sprinkled the roast with worcestershire sauce before putting the carrots and potatoes on top of the roast. I also used a much bigger roast. The roast I used was around 5 lbs. This recipe is on top of my list. Wife is still ranting about the roast and is upset it's better and easier then hers.

I've shared this recipe with a lot of people and they all agree it's insanely good (and easy to prepare!).  Having made this over a dozen times, I have my own little \"enhancements\" but you don't need them as it is great as is, but these things just elevate this to a whole 'nother level.  1)  I brown the WELL floured roast for a few minutes on all sides to get a nice caramelization going on before putting into the cooker.  I am fortunate in that my slow cooker insert is non-stick metal and I can use it on the cooktop directly.  2)  I use 1/2 cup red wine and 1/4 cup water for the dry mixes.  3)  I add 4 or 5 stalks celery chopped up (in add'n to the carrots).  Sometimes I add quartered red potatoes, but lately I just serve over mashed potatoes.  If you find this is too salty for your liking (I love it as is) the potatoes will help cut that down - potatoes always help make food taste less salty FYI... 4)  A few dashes of some Worcestershire sauce does wonders in the liquid mix.   Let this baby go low and slow and you will be happy you found this recipe.  If you want to get super creative try caramelizing the onions a little first.   Thanks keylimeone!  :)",

So I made it again and made the following changes and it was a hit (and better too):\n\n1. I only marinated the meat with black pepper.  The dry seasonings have enough sodium already.\n\n2. I couldn't find ranch dressing mix, so I used ranch dip mix instead.\n\n3. I mixed the dry ingredients with hot water so that they'll melt faster and added some minced garlic too.  Then let it sit for about 10 minutes before putting it into the slow cooker.\n\nNext time I'm going to put some jalapenos in there to make it spicy.\n\n***Follow-up on my original review:\n\nI made couple of other changes and the dish turned out even better -\n\n1. Mixed the dried ingredients with 1 cup of water.\n\n2. Added crushed red peppers onto the dry ingredients according to how spicy I want it to be.\n\n3. Marinated the meat with crushed peppercorns.\n\n4. I scooped some of the sauce from the side with a ladle and poured it all over the top of the meat 2 & 1/2 hours before it was done, so that the top of the meat would not get too dry.\n\n5. I served it with rice the first couple of times, but served it with spaghetti because this time (I only cooked them according to the package's directions, no salt added into the pasta water), poured some sauce over the noodles and then the meat on top.  The sauce complemented the noodles really well.",

I have tried a couple others from the site in my crock pot, but none were as easy and delicious as this one! The ingredients were incredibly simple and inexpensive, and it took only about 10 minutes total to prepare. I was leary about the lack of liquid in with the roast, but the water from the carrots and onions mixed with the beef and seasoning to make a delicious broth! Tonight my boyfriend and I are making roast beef sandwiches from the left overs, and I couldn't be more excited! I  found my new pot roast recipe and would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a cheap, easy and delicious dinner!",
