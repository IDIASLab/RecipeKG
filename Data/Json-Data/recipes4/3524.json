It took MUCH longer than stated for the chicken to cook with everything inside, and mine never got to the stated temp (but the chicken was cooked through...just the stuffing wasn't at that temp- which may be a food hazard!  I think a way to remedy that would be to follow the first steps up to after you make the sauce.  Then, I'd pour the sauce over the chicken, cover it, and cook it in the oven for 20-30 mins at 375.  That would also ensure that the raw onions and garlic in the cream cheese were cooked.  On taste, this recipe is five stars- just not quite the right way to make it!  I'll definitely make it again!  I served it over rice, and as another reviewer said, there's a TON of sauce, but it helps with the cooking and keeping the meat moist, I'm sure!",

I did as it directed when I was simmering it in the sauce. I simmered it for about 20 to 25 minutes. I don't understand why it says 5 minutes when you return it to the sauce. It should be about 20 to 25 minutes. I served it with a great tossed salad while our Fettuccini was cooking I served it with the Fettuccini and Asparagus. We both loved it. I will make it many times again. I got the Prosciutto at Wal-Mart for 3.00. Very tender not overcooked. It leaves a wonderful aftertaste. You can roll them and refrigerate them (I tied them with string) and just do the cook them while you are making your salad and Vegetable. I am eager to have them for dinner tomorrow. Just the two of us so I have good leftovers.",

                "reviewBody": "Very tasty! My local market was out of prosciutto so I improvised and use bacon. I was concerned that the chicken might be lacking in flavor by doing so but it was great even with the substitution. To cut calories; I used cornstarch for my thickening agent which allowed me to omit the butter. The gravy was quite flavorful this way. I boiled angel hair pasta and added it to the sauce once it was done. I topped the pasta with the chicken and served with a side of asparagus. I think a sundried tomato pesto would be excellent added to the cream cheese mixture. Also would like to try topping it with mozzarella cheese and baking it as opposed to finishing it on the stove. A great recipe the way it is but I believe will lend itself to a host of variations.",

                "reviewBody": "Some people care about their diet but for me it comes down to how good something tastes so when I saw that this recipe called for low fat cream cheese I substituted with regular instead. After trying the dish I realized that having the heavier cream cheese did not seem to add any punch to the dish. Because of the way that the sauce cooks the cream cheese is really an after thought compared to the wine and basil flavoring. While the recipe is a little bit more work the dish has rich flavors and creates an impressive impression on guests. When cooking this recipe I'd recommended boiling the chicken for closer to 7 - 10 minutes vs. 5 minutes and to make sure that the chicken is covered during the simmer/boiling stage of the cooking. Because the stuffed chicken breasts tend to be pretty thick there is a tendency to undercook the inside meat if you're not careful about how long it stays in the skillet. I'd also recommend using a big pan for your skillet instead of a traditional frying pan because four of these monster sized pieces of chicken will have trouble fitting in a traditional frying pan all at once. Overall I give this one a four out of five but make sure that your guests enjoy basil or else this dish will end up as leftovers.",

The chicken was still moist and I think baking it (covered) for the extra time allowed the flavors of the sauce to develop even more. Next time I will probably add more (and probably dryer) wine as well as a bit more salt (recipe didn't call for any but I added some and still felt it lacking) but overall this is a great dish that I will definitely add to my recipe box.",
