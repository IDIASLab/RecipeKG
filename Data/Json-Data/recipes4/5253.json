I loved the texture of the flattened biscuit in this little sandwich.  They came out of the oven nicely browned and I let sit for about 5 minutes to let the inside ingredients set up a bit.  I served this with fried potatoes and fresh strawberries and it made for a great meal.  I think it will be fun to try this with other meats.  We think leftover roast beef would be great with the swiss cheese.  Thanks for much for sharing your recipe!",

I also think using jalape\u00f1o and cream cheese would make an awesome jalape\u00f1o popper! Thanks for sharing a fun new staple recipe:)",

My only problem was I used Pillsbury 7.5 oz. canned biscuits and they were very small and hard to get any bigger than 3 inches when flattened so some of my seams came open while baking and cheese oozed out. I'll find larger biscuits next time I make these. I served them with a fruit salad with Poppy Seed Dressing I from this site a perfect match. Would make a great brunch menu.",
