I made vanilla frosting for it and topped it with strawberries and it was amazing. You can easily switch it up and make a yellow cake with non-instant vanilla pudding and it's yummy as well. My mom loved both cakes so much she requested a layered cake for Mother's Day. Everyone who had it raved about it. You should definitely try it, it's easy to make and very very good. \nOne tip though, when you make the pudding and it gets thick don't just add the cake mix and stir it together. Doing that makes it look too thick and not easily workable. I put the pudding and the mix into a bowl and mixed them together. Doing that gave it more of a batter texture and easier to work with.",

Now I make it for my Dad's birthday. We use aluminum foil to line the cake pan. It makes it easier to remove from the pan since the chocolate chips melt and are still gooey when you need to remove it from a greased pan. I tried it with the greased and floured pan and either got it out still warm and gooey to make a mess or waited till it cooled completely only to leave half still in the pan because the grease re-solidified and stuck it to the sides and bottom.\r\n\r\nYUM-YUM",
