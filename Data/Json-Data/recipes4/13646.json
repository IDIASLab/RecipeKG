I also had to cook it for about 10 minutes in Step 2.  After that, I poured the mixture into a casserole dish, covered it with some salsa, then with some sour cream, and finally I sprinkled some cheddar and mozzarella cheese on top.  Then I popped in under the broiler for just a few minutes until the cheese was melted.  We used the light restaurant-style tortilla chips and they were great.  Both my husband and I loved it!   We'll probably end up getting two or three meals out of it too.  This is definitely going in my recipe box!",

Make sure you use strong tortilla chips as this is a very hearty mixture.  The scoop shaped ones would probably work best.\nThere is a lot of food here!

After those extra cups of water and an additional 10 or 15 minutes we were left with edible cooked rice but not tender like you'd expect with this. It was disappointing but can easily be fixed next time when I just use a rice cooker to ensure the correct texture and then just mix the two together. Not to shabby:)",

I made the rice seperately and then added it to the ground turkey (rather than ground beef) mixture and followed the rest of the recipe.  I added additional toppings on the side for everyone to add as they liked, such as chopped red onion, sliced black olives, and sour cream.
