First, instead of using can mushrooms, use fresh ones (do not worry about the liquid from the can mushrooms - it adds a horrible taste to the sauce!)  I used fresh garlic.  Instead of following the recipe by the book, use your own measurements for the sherry and cream of mushroom.  I like to add more sherry and one extra can of cream of mushroom, that way you have alot of sauce for the beef to cook in.  Fresh ground black pepper add an umph to the recipe.",

There is no way you can cook the  meat for an hour with the amount of liquid mentioned. I had no choice but to serve this alone because it was too dry for a topping.  The mixture had a great flavor, but the beef was tough as expected.  It was similar to stroganoff.  I served with mashed potatoes and french green beans.  This is worth trying if your have all the ingredients on hand.  If you want to serve over something you'll probably want to add something to thin it down.",

I did mine in two batches. Also don't stir the beef around while browning - just let the beef strips sit in the hot oil until very brown on one side. Only then flip to the other side. This adds a nice brown color (and flavor!) to the sauce. I used fresh garlic and no mushrooms as I didn't have any fresh on hand. I deglazed the pan with the sherry before adding the mushroom soup.",
