I used 4 large peppers instead of 6.I used a large can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced ones and forgot the tomato sauce. I just poured more of the crushed tomatoes on top before baking instead of the tomato sauce. I diced up my mozzarella instead of shredding. I also forgot to boil my peppers (again my fault!) but we like ours a little bit crisp so it worked out fine. My husband raved over these (he had 2!!) and I will definitely make again!!
