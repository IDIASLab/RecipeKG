(I did sample the soup and it was good but a little thin and needed some additional spices.  I added some thyme and garlic powder  - much better.)  Anyways, I put the soup away to eat the next day.  On Saturday when I took it out, it was way thicker and was REALLY GOOD.  Everybody loved it.  There was one serving left over which I had for breakfast on Sunday, and I must say that Sunday was the best day for it yet.  The tate and texture were outstanding. \nOne thing I might do differently next time would be to use round steak cubes rather than chuck so the meat would be more tender.  This was no fault of the recipe, I just like softer beef in my soups.  I will definitely be making this again.",

The taste was rather bland, so I too will add garlic, or Italian seasonings, or maybe a bay leaf or two.  Parmesan cheese really improved the taste, even without the other seasonings.  Definitely a recipe that I'm going to make many more times.",
