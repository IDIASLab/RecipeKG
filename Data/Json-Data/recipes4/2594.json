The sides browned nicely, but the tops were still very light. Next time I may add some melted butter to the tops about halfway through baking. I couldn't wait until dinner, and tried a biscuit. I half expected them to be bland, but they were delicious. The salt in the flour, richness from the butter and tangy undertone from the sour cream are a delightful combination. I spread a little homemade apple butter on one for a very tasty snack.  It's so quick and simple and can easily be doubled.",

Like I would bite into one and it would fall apart. That really was the only downfall for this recipe. When I eat a biscuit I like to bite into it and not have to pick the pieces off of my plate. I think it could use another flavor besides the sour cream and butter. Next time I'd like to add some garlic powder or something if I were to serve this with dinner again. Maybe knead the dough a bit with a little more flour and see if cutting this with a biscuit cutter would make a difference. This would make a great breakfast biscuit with a homemade jam spread on the insides.",

                "reviewBody": "I tried this recipe as an experiment just for grins because some things about it were so unusual. What struck me? First baking them in a muffin tin. Second at the moderate temperature of 350 a temperature more for cupcakes. Third a stick of butter for a cup of flour?! Finally some reviewers reported the tops didn't brown. I decided to try this recipe with a different take. I blended the butter with the flour until crumbly then gently stirred in the sour cream taking care not to overwork the dough so as to ensure tenderness. I like the crusty sort of crunchy golden exterior of a nicely baked biscuit so I baked them at 450 on a cookie sheet lined with foil for easy clean-up. I dropped them onto the sheet in mounds and flattened them slightly. (If I try these again I'd skip that step - maybe they'd rise just a tad higher) I was pleased with the results all of which I expected. I saved time and a pan to clean by dropping them onto cookie sheets. The biscuits baked to a golden brown including the tops - and in 10 minutes! They were soft and tender with a crusty exterior. And because of all that butter they were rich and flavorful. But...as I also expected these were TOO buttery - you could use half the butter (even if you had to add a little extra sour cream or even milk to compensate) and these would be much better - less butter-saturated and a little less salty. Four stars as I baked them lower if baked as directed and they didn't brown.",

                "reviewBody": "The recipe given is a dough not a batter. If you want a thick batter use buttermilk instead of sour cream. It also has more butter than usual. To make a thick batter as described I used: A scant cup of whole wheat pastry flour (I always use whole wheat) 1/2 tsp each baking powder and baking soda. Then I softened 3 Tbsp. margarine and mixed it w/ 1/2 c. lite sour cream and 3 Tbsp. water to get the right consistency & baked in a muffin tin as recommended but at 400 deg in the toaster oven for 14 min. covered loosely w/ foil and an additional 5 min. uncovered. The batter created so much steam that they didn't have enough substance for biscuits. There is such a thing as TOO light. They did have good flavor. Next time I will make it w/o water as a soft dough. I will use my own labor-saving method and make scones (faster than biscuits) by hand-forming the dough into a log about 3\" diameter then patting it down into a 3/4\" thick rectangle on a small non-stick toaster oven tray. I then score it w/ a sharp knife into triangles--this size recipe makes about 5 good sized scones. It is much easier than rolling & cutting biscuits. I'll bake as I described above. What this recipe has taught me is that by softening the margarine I can skip the usual scone step of cutting the shortening into the dry ingredients and that lite sour cream is a slight improvement over my usual buttermilk. I appreciate learning to make already easy scones even easier.",
