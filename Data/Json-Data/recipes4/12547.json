This is pretty spicy so if you want some spice but not a lot, I'd only put in one.  Second, I accidentally grabbed fresh cilantro at the store instead of basil.  I added half of the bushel and it was fabulous.  Lastly, when I cut off the tops of the bell peppers, I trimmed them up and and diced up the excess and added that in with the veggies also.  I don't usually try new recipes unless they've had a lot of high ratings but the combination on herbs, spices and meat sounded so wonderful and I was NOT disappointed.  You will love this recipe.",

When stuffing peppers, I cut the green stem just even with the pepper, then cut off the bottom of the pepper for the opening - they stand up better when baking. Of course, they still must be cleaned out. I used red,yellow and orange peppers for stuffing and the taste was just wonderful. Next time, I'll use green peppers as I believe it will taste just as good, and be a prettier presentation. Thanks!",

I didn't see what the tomato sauce poured over it would do other than spread out in a thin layer at the bottom of the baking dish so I gave that a miss. Also accidentaly cooked the rice seperately before adding it to the sauce (also used a bit more than called for) but it worked fine. I would definitely not cut down on the amount of cheese added to the mixture as it gives it a great texture and of course flavour. You can play around with this dish using different kinds of cheese. Will definitely make it again. It's so good I actually want to make this for company!",

However, it was an excellent starting point.  \n\nBeware when buying chorizo... if you don't have access to a mexican buthcher shop that makes it's own, buy the best quality stick chorizo you can find. Make sure it looks more like sausage and less like ground to a pulp...something! Those ground tubes cook up to highly salted mush and are over 1/2 grease!\n\nI had already make a gulf coast style rice so I mixed that in with the cooked chorizo, carrots and tomato. Since my rice was already seasoned with garlic & onion, I didn't add more.\n\nMixed in a heaping handful of Chuhuahua cheese instead of the mix suggested.\n\nVery delicious! Thanks!",

My husband and kids loved them...I made them with homemade chorizo which I highly reccomend I use Anne's homemade chorizo from this site its simple and quick to make. Instead of mixing the cheese in with the filling I spooned some filling into the pepper put in a layer of cheese spooned in more filling and topped with cheese that way it had a nice cheesy center. The only thing I will do differently next time is cook the rice first and stir it in when the meat mixture is done....Thank you for such a great recipe!",
