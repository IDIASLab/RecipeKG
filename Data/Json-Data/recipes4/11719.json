I used real minced garlic, slightly less pepper, and the exact amount of ground cumin.  Be careful to not place more cumin than recipe calls for as it would be too strong a flavor & overtake the rice.  You can add salt to taste per individual taste after it's cooked.  We have declared this as our favorite family rice side dish!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

I agree w/ other reviewers that it's a bit on the mild (no, no not bland!) side, but it is what it is -- a nicely-seasoned simple rice, that's more interesting that just plain ol' white rice. I made it as written, except that I toasted the rice dry, added the ingredients up to water, then added boiling water, so that upon being turned to low and covered, it was perfectly done to the right taste and texture in 20 min. Served it alongside chipotle chicken breasts with a sprinkle of green onions for color, and melty cheese. I would gladly make it again as a side to another Mexican entree.",
