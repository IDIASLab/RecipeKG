I will most definitely be making this again. I can not wait to have a get together so that I can share it with others. I gave this recipe 5 stars only because that was the highest option available.

I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added maple syrup rather then milk, Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs, and mayo instead of sour cream (we never keep sour cream stocked in our house). Although moist, it held together beautifully. I topped it off with a glaze (1/2 cup ketchup, 4 tbsp brown sugar, 3 tbsp whit vinegar) when I turned the oven temperature up for the remaining 15 minutes. Perfect. Will stop the hunt with this one!!",
