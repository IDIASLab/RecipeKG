So I more than doubled the garlic, added a bit of lemon juice, was generous with the wine, and threw in lots of freshly grated black pepper.  I also was a bit mindful about limiting the amount of oil we used.  At the end, this dish turned out lovely!  The broth is beautiful especially when served with some steamed white rice or crusty garlic bread.  We loved it and will definitely make again, perhaps with just seafood next time - shrimp and scallops.  Thanks for the great meal!",

Using what I had on hand, I substituted some frozen green peas and red bell pepper for the mushrooms, and we LOVED those alterations \u2013 they added such great flavor, not to mention making for beautiful, colorful eye appeal.  I winged it when it came to the sauce, adding more wine and chicken broth (a far superior option than water) as necessary.  I also swirled in some butter on low heat at the end, making the sauce rich and velvety smooth.   I served this over a tri-color capellini.  This was simply excellent and elegant.",

Apparently that's not how everyone on here feels because yet again I am dissapointed thinking that a recipe would just be good because of the rating it had. This was a bland recipe I thought it was OK at best but my boyfriend and cousin didn't even give it that good of a review. We all wound up picking the shrimp out and dipping it in cocktail sauce to have some flavor.. I even added some cheyenne pepper to spice it up a little it helped but not much.",

We also combined the juice of 1 lemon with the water to make up the 1 1/4 cup measurement. The next time we may use chicken broth as others have suggested. Either way will be delicious!",
