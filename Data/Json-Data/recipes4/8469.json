I shredded the zucchini and let it side for a while for the water to drain out.. better on paper towels than in the food. I think the key to this is to use a wonderful sauce and using the fresh mozzarella. I am not a fan of fresh mozzarella usually but it worked in this dish perfectly.. will use it again for sure",
