It was very flavorful & filling and didn't need anything else other than crusty bread to soak up the stew.  I didn't use a beer but added extra beef stock instead.  I also floured the meat before cooking - it seemed to thicken up the stew.  I cooked it for 3 hours & the meat was tender & perfect.  Great recipe.",

I don't season or flour the meat cubes before browning at all.  There is no need to.  The spices, beer (I use Sam Adams Boston Lager) meat, tomatoes, etc, all work together very nicely to make a delicious dish.  I eat this as is, or in burritos, tacos, the best super nachos ever,  on a bun as a delicious twist on a sloppy joe, put leftovers in your spaghetti sauce, endless meals with this one.  Add more seasonings or peppers if you like real spicy, or cut them out if need too.  You'll still get a great dish.  By far, my favorite recipe on AR, and I love a lot of them!",
