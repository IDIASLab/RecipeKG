Lastly, I sauteed half a small onion along with my fresh mushrooms, added that on top, and used a low fat honey dijon as a topping. Heavenly dish!!:-)  I hope I at least knocked off 20 grams of fat doing it my way though!  Ally",

I also use a double-sided electric grill to cook the chicken then after assembling the other prepared(cooked)ingredients, I broil them for a minute to melt the cheese. DO use a good quality honey mustard dressing or make your own, forget the cheapos, they won't do.
