Thai chefs typically just soak the noodles in room temperature water so that's what I did while I was preparing the sauce.  You want to soak them until you can wrap it around your finger without breaking.  I started the sauce in a 2.5 quart saucepan and did use enough corn starch/water to get a thicker bubbly sauce.  I used only 4 cups of chicken broth and all the ingredients including Thai red chili paste and ginger powder.  While the sauce is cooking and the noodles are soaking, I saut\u00e9ed zucchini, red onion, and mushrooms seasoned with pepper, salt, and garlic powder in a skillet with oil.  During this time, I drained the noodles and added them to the sauce for a few minutes.  Once the vegetables were to the firmness I desired, I then poured the noodles and sauce into the skillet, sprinkled with red pepper flakes, and stirred it all together.  I let all the flavors come together for a few minutes and then served topped with peanuts.  My family LOVED it!  No mushy, no watery, just perfect.",

My did not come out soupy however the noodles did get sticky. I think the corn starch is a little bit much and would lessen it just a bit.
