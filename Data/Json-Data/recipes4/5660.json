Didn't use Hellmann's mayo just used our favorite light Kraft mayo. I did add in a tablespoon of sugar since Hellman's tends to have a sweeter taste. I also used red potatoes and didn't need the full amount of mayonnaise I added until it reached a good consistency about 1 1/2 cups total. More than likely because red potatoes are smaller. I also added in more of the olives and pickles. People were getting seconds and raving about it and asking for the recipe. We loved this salad and will be making it again. Now I must email the recipe to some friends. Thanks Lela a real hit.",
