Variations can definitely be made to taste...sometimes I use chicken (boneless or not)...sometimes I use shrimp...sometimes I use both. My family makes it with chicken innards (gizzards, heart, etc.) which I'm not too keen on eating. Hey, but with this soup it's to each his or her own.",

                "reviewBody": "I just made this recipe today for my boyfriend who loves cilantro and he was not that impressed.  The concept is actually really good however in my opinion the recipe needs some tweaking.  The reason for this is that the rice and hominy together in the same pot created a mush that was not at all attractive either tastewise or visually.  My recommendation is either cook the rice separately and leave out the hominy (substitute corn) or make it into a soup.  For the soup, I will only use 2 chicken breasts, half a cup of rice and I will not use hominy since the hominy and rice pretty much have the same consistency.  Next time I plan on using corn and adding some lime juice, a little cayenne powder and also chicken stock instead of water.  Also adding some chopped cilantro that has not been pulverized might be a good idea.",

I actually ended up using almost double the amount of cilantro and garlic for the sauce.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and cumin before sauteing.  My chicken was a little over-cooked in the end, so next time I'll be careful to really just lightly brown it before starting the 20-minute cook-time.  Also, I HIGHLY recommend serving this with a squeeze of fresh lime juice. It really brought the flavors together.",
