However i did use a no-sugar fruit spread and that could have played a big part. If you're planning on trying this recipe be sure not to make that mistake. I had leftover chicken but invented my own sauce the next day and was much more pleased......here's what i came up with: 1 TB balsamic vinegar 2 TB ketchup 1/2 cup chicken stock 1/2 cup no-sugar berry spread 1 1/2 tsp sugar 1/4 tsp onion powder 1/4 tsp garlic powder salt and pepper to taste 1/4 water 1/2 TB cornstarch.

The sauce (more of a glaze actually) added a nice depth and looked great drizzled on the chicken. I used 1 tsp of dried lemon thyme in place of fresh but followed everything else exactly. I didn't need the cornstarch as I thought the sauce reduced quite nicely. A wonderful blend of flavors which went very well with a nice salad and herbed potatoes!",
