I searched the web and found a few quiche recipes and then adapted my own from the basic ingredients. This was, to my surprise, super easy AND super delicious. Use lactose-free margarine instead of olive oil if desired, and jalapeno yogurt cheese, goat-milk Cheddar, or some combination. Enjoy!",

I baked it in a large skillet fry pan, which gave the edges a great crusty texture!  A total thumbs up!,",

Each time I use whatever cheese I have on hand, but I always use feta cheese with either pepper jack, cheddar, even mozzarella. To make it a little spicier I add either roasted hot peppers or even the oil that I use to roast hot peppers. We eat this for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Thanks for a glutin free receipe that we can all enjoy. Everyone that tried it, loves it. Leftovers go in the refrigerator and then heated up in microwave for 15 seconds and we're ready for more! I also bake it in a pie plate.",
