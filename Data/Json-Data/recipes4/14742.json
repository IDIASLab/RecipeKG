Sometimes I add dried minced onion to the sauce and I almost always season the meat either with Mrs. Dash tomato basil seasoning or a packet of spaghetti seasoning just for extra flavor before adding the sauce to the meat.

Other reviews said a bit bland, and light on tomato sauce....so I just added some spices from a cooking light lasagna recipe and 8 oz tomato sauce:  1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp basil. I also mixed a high-end jar marinara with a low end canned version. And added 1 tbsp vinegar as a final touch. \n\nCooked 5 hours on low. Result: PERFECTION! The lasagna was not drippy or dry, lots of good meaty sauce (I used 2.25 lbs ground beef, since I doubled and didn't want to break a pkg).\nI took it to a church function and they scraped the pot clean. ;-)",

I was asked for the recipe - you know it's good when that happens. I doubled the recipe in every respect except for not having enough ricotta or cottage cheese. Tho' next time I'll ensure I have the requisite amount there was no noticeable lack of quality. Set slow cooker on low for 4hrs the night before; shut it off and set it back on at low for 3hrs before we wanted to serve it the next day & it was perfect. In fact we kept it on low for everyone to help themselves over a 3hr period and it kept its moisture all through the evening. Another thing I didn't have lasagna pasta sheets so I used rotini pasta. But pasta is pasta in my opinion. I'll use the same pasta next time I use this recipe. Certainly makes for easier serving. As to flavour the only thing I will add next time is a small amount of salt to the mixture.",
