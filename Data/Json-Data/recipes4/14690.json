As written there is too much liquid and you get a mushy dressing. I suggest leaving out the water completely and using the liquid from the oysters if you need more liquid. On that note, whole canned oysters do not have much eye appeal. That and biting into a whole one was a bit off putting. I think it would be better if you chopped them up small and that way they are incorporated throughout the entire dish instead of just hunks here and there. If done that way I'm thinking you could also get away with only using 1 can of oysters instead of 2 which would save money. This was super simple and tasty and one I will make again with my minor tweaks.",
