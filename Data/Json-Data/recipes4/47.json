I use \r\nDuncan Hines Butter recipe.  1/2 cup butter,melted. 4 eggs. 8 oz cream cheese, softened.  3/4 cup powdered sugar.  And this is not a mistake; only 3/4 cup. 1 tsp each vanilla and lemon flavoring. In a large mixing bowl, combine yellow cake mix, melted margarine, and 2 beaten eggs. Pour into a greased and floured 13\"x9\" cake pan.   Please note that the cake mix mixture will have the consistency of a dough more so than a cake, so it will be kind of thick. You can use a spatula to spread it.   In a  blender or food processor, combine softened cream cheese,  powdered sugar,  2 beaten eggs; vanilla/lemon .... flavorings (to taste).   Pour over the cake mixture.  Bake 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden. \r\nYou can use a 13X9 pyrex  or 2 squared foil pans (about 8x8) .  You can also cut into small squares and serve.\r\n\r\n",
