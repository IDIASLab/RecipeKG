I had a box of chicken stock in the fridge, so I used that instead of bouillon granules and water which I think ramped up the flavor (and reduced sodium content, as well).   Found no need to add any salt, plenty salty for us.  I still love my homemade bean soup, but this will be my \"go-to\" recipe if I want a quick bean soup on the table in a half an hour.

I simmered for a few minutes and then added the spices and vegetables.  No salt needed.  I also added the beans and a can of diced tomatoes.  I put in some basil too as I liked that suggestion by someone else here.  I let it all cook for 30 minutes.  Then I added the cooked ham I had previously taken off that ham bone and anything else that came loose on the ham bone.  I let it go for another 20 minutes and then took out the bone and served.  It was great!",
