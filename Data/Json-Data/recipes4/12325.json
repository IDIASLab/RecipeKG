I chopped 1 TBSP of fresh parsley and added it to the soup; as opposed to making an herb bundle. I had leftover chicken breasts from the night before. I chopped up the chicken and added to the soup and simmered as called for. I also had leftover rice which I added to the soup once I turned the heat off. The Old Bay Seasoning adds a delightful flavor and browning the flour beforehand makes for a wonderfully creamy soup without the floury taste. The best recipe for cream of chicken soup I ve yet to find and sooooo simple! The recipe states that it serves 12. I halved the recipe and it was only enough for one meal for my husband and me. If you re using this for a main course as I did; you may want to increase the amount.",

This is a great base recipe but we all have different tastes so it bothers me when people cut down a recipe without making their personal adjustments to it. I made this last night for a Men's get together that is happening tonight. I doubled the recipe & made these adjustments: instead of chicken breasts I got a roasted chicken from my local grocery and chopped all the meat up. I used 2 onions 8 cloves of garlic (we like garlic). I used 6 cups chicken broth 4 cups half/half 2 cups heavy cream. I didn't use the spice bundle instead just added 2 TBSP of dried parsley. Even though I doubled the recipe I used only 1 1/2 cups of cooked rice. I also sprinkled in some of Paula Deen's \"House Seasoning\"...I always have that on hand. I did have to add a little bit of corn startch to thicken it up a bit...but the final product was PERFECT! I will definitely be making again. BTW the longer it cooks on the stove the better. Tonight I will be transfering it over to my crock pot to keep it warm.",

I also added 1/2 white wine and cut down the milk 1/2 cup. In place of 1 cup of broth I added the left over gravy from the night before that was chicken broth based. I didn't have Old Bay so I used Emerill's chicken rub and about 1/2 tsp. of tarragon. I also sauteed about 1/2 lb. baby portabellas and 1/2 matchstick carrots in TBS. of butter and added it with the rice and about 1/2 steamed peas. Simmered it for 30 minutes removed the bay leaf added a little fresh ground sea salt and pepper to taste. Absolutely delicious. Very elegant soup I felt like I could serve it at a dinner party. I think fresh aspargus in season would be good in it too. Thanks for sharing.",

I used one packet (.75 lb) of Schwan's roasted pulled chicken. I omitted the spice packet but added a bay leaf and celery seed. This simmered down to a very thick and creamy soup which I thinned just a touch with leftover broth. Hubby really liked the kick the Old Bay gave it. This is my new go-to base for cream soups.
