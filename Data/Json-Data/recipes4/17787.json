This problem was not mentioned in any of the other reviews so I am wondering if I goofed up somehow even though I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a little extra water which I am now glad that I did. Next time I will be adding at least 3 cups of liquid. Also this is a great recipe to doctor up by adding (peas carrots onions garlic etc) or substitute other ingredients (chicken broth beef broth french onion soup etc). Thanks!",

I've been making rice lately by heating oil and sauteing the rice and spicing until really hot then adding the liquid rather than boiling the liquid adding rice then simmering. It comes out a little less sticky or clumpy. Add vegetable bits toward the end of cooking and you have a delicious pilaf! With this oven recipe I put about a tablespoon of olive oil in the baking dish along with a bit of ginger garlic and basil pastes (fresh grated would work too) lemon zest and a squeeze of the juice and stirred everything until the rice was completely coated. Then I proceeded per the recipe. Most delicious brown rice I've ever made! I'm definitely going to try this method with basmati jasmine and plain long-grain rice too just adjusting the liquid and cooking times. Thank you!",
