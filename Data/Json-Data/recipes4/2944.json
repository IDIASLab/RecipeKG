I made a few changes because of what I had on hand: oat flour instead of flax meal wheat bran instead of germ. I also used veg. broth when cooking lentils and added 1 Tbsp. vegetarian Worcestershire to the lentils while they were in the food processor. Put mix of tomato paste and ketchup on top covered with foil and baked for 45 mins uncovered for 10 and it was great! (Not too dry not too mushy.) This was my first time making vegetarian meatloaf and it was the best my husband and I have ever had. Thanks for the recipe!",

I followed suggestions from the previous reviewers and topped it with tomato paste and ketchup. This recipe was pretty good but I didn't like the thyme. The thyme flavour really overwhelmed the whole recipe. I think this one might be better if it went in a more Indian direction using cumin and coriander instead of the thyme. I'll definitely alter the spices if I make it again but I did like the lentil/flax/wheat germ/veggie aspects of the dish.",

I sprouted the lentils for2 days in advance. I put them in a glass bowl cover them with water and I left them in a cupboard a warm place and they sprouted. They become more protein than and they digest better. I crushed them into puree raw with out cooking. I did not want to lose the nutrients. I also added mushrooms celery and broth. I did not use the flaxseeds. I followed a suggestion and I used barley flour and wheat bran instead. I also added 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup of dried sun tomatoes and the egg whites. I also added 1/4 of chopped jalapenos pepper sea salt and ground black pepper. It was delicious. Thanks for sharing your recipe!!!",

I've only been eating a vegetarian diet for about 2 weeks now and as long as I can eat stuff like this I think I will be just fine. This recipe is excellent and very tasty even for someone who is used to eating meat. It even has a meat like texture once cooked! I followed the recipe but pureed the onion (I don't like onion chunks)and also added in some Portugese seasoning in addition to the other seasinings required. I followed the recomendations by others and baked the loaf covered in foil for 45 mins and then uncovered it and poured a mixture of ketchup and tomato sauce sprinkled with parsley on top and then baked for another 30 mins. It tastes great and the recipe made a lot way to much to fit into a standard size UK loaf pan.",
