I would cook the peppers a bit longer to get them softer. If the peppers are too al dente, then when you try to cut them, the filling slides out. Next time, I think 60 minutes and then 10 minutes for the cheese.\n\n2. I like a bit of spice, so I think some more seasoning would be in order. Maybe some chopped jalapeno or garlic or something to jazz up the filling a little bit.\n\nThat said, it was an enjoyable meal and anytime you can get a filling, good tasting meal for under 400 calories...that's a win.",
