Instead of putting the cheese inside of the burger I just grilled them and melted the cheese over top. These burgers had a nice kick to them. These were very moist and very good - a healthy and nice change from regular beef burgers. Perfect on toasted whole grain rolls with lettuce tomato and a dill pickle on the side!",

I made as is except for adding one egg white to help moisten and bind all ingredients together and I topped with the pepper jack cheese instead of stuffing them. Grilled outside on the gas grill but laid down foil over the grate since I've had lots of trouble with turkey burgers (especially moist ones) sticking before even when sprayed with Pam. Perfect solution! I served these on homemade onion rolls (yum) with spicy ketchup! Will make these again for sure.",

Used garlic powder instead of fresh extra green onion and no white chipotle chile powder instead of cayenne and a chopped roasted Hatch chile instead of red pepper.
