I didn't have a 20 oz. package of sauerkraut so I used 2 15 oz. cans. MISTAKE! I added an extra can of tomatoes but that didn't help much. I added sugar and more sausage to the leftovers and still had difficulty with the vinegar flavor. Stick to the original amounts of the ingredients.",

I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used a 28 oz can of chopped tomatoes and 2 fresh tomatoes which were trying to go bad. I only used 2 cups of water and added an extra cup of rice (2 cups total). I really wanted this to be thick! With the liquid from the tomatoes it worked out well. I did drain the sauerkraut. I also added basil and horseradish (thanks for the suggestion) with the tomatoes. I was really happy with the results. It was hearty and had a really nice flavor. I will probably make it again and again!",
