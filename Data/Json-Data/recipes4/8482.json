I don't use cloves or bay leaves, I use only 1 teaspoon cumin, I use two tablespoons of oregano, I don't use cayenne or any peppers besides the black pepper and about 5 chipotles in adobo sauce  (and it's spicy enough that way)  but it still tastes amazing. These are just little changes I've made throughout the years. I honestly think it's better than store boughs. I've made this at least two dozen times and it never fails.  I put it in the slow cooker for usually eight hours on low after about an hour on high in the beginning. Or you can do 5-6 hours in high. Sometimes I don't even brown the meat and honestly it turns out almost as good as so if you're in a hurry don't feel bad about not browning the meet.  We eat these like a quesadilla, so I take a tortilla and then I put some sauce (ranch or copycat Taco Bell quesadilla sauce) and then I put shredded Gouda or mixed white cheeses and the Barbacoa and I put another tortilla on top and I just fry that in a tiny bit of oil in my cast-iron pan on both sides until it's melted and it is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Top with guacamole and dip it in ranch and you'll definitely make whoever is lucky enough to eat this very happy! I have a pot cooking right now.  I usually double the recipe, it heats up great so leftovers never go uneaten, no matter how much I make!",

I made as-written except didn't use cayenne - just because I couldn't find it in my pantry, and after the serrano and all the chipotles I wasn't too worried about making it spicier :) I used a pork butt with this marinade and it was SO. GOOD. Marinaded it in the blended stuff overnight then slow cooked with the onions, bay leaf, and stock.  I will hold onto this one!!!",

I find meat shreds better when cooked overnight I put the frozen roast and sauce ingredients in the slowcooker at bed time cooked for 12 hours on low shredded and defatted the meat removed the bay leaves put the meat back in the sauce and left on warm until dinner time it was very tender and flavourful. I made home made tostadas from corn tortillas and served the beef on top with all the usual toppings rice and cucumber salad on the side.",
