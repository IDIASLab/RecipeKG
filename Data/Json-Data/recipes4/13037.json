I added one clove of crushed garlic to the butter before I fried the chops, and added julienned red peppers about 2 minutes before I added the mushrooms.  The sauce was perfectly seasoned with just the salt.   Note that, if you're like me and have double servings of pasta, you might want to increase the sauce ingredients by  25 - 50%. It was really good though. Will make it again.",

So the pasta to sauce ratio wasn't quite right I would want to have it saucier next time. I'll make it again though. Thanks!",

Very tasty although I would have liked to add a sprinkling of something green (parsley maybe?) to make presentation prettier.
