I added soba noodles and upped the chicken broth because I like noodly/brothy soups. The lime is key (pardon the pun) - in addition to what the recipe called for I served wedges with the soup so everyone could add more if they wanted. I did not include the chili-garlic sauce or the jalapeno to the pot since it would be too spicy for my 3 year old but adding it to my bowl separately after serving was still yummy! Will for sure make again!",
