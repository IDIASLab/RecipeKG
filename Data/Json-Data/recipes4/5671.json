I am new to cooking with avocado and was amazed at the perfect texture it gave the pesto. The avocado gave it a nutty taste without having to actually used pine-nuts. The only change I made was I sauteed the shrimp and additional garlic in a few tablespoons of butter instead of adding the shrimp to the boiling penne. Then tossed in the drained pasta pesto Romano and a splash of leftover heavy cream and warmed it through. Easy delicious and aromatic. Thanks for posting!",

Two things for the next time though: I'd put the mixture on the stove at a warm setting at the end while adding the shrimp and rest of the ingredients. Although the dish was warm at the beginning it quickly cooed off. I would also add more seasoning - maybe more garlic and salt.",
