I made lots of additions/revisions plus I halved the recipe... so take that into consideration for amounts used. First I used yellow potatoes. These have a nice flavor for soups. I chopped the bacon before browning... this makes browning easier. Then I wanted this to be spicy and flavorful... probably too spicy for most but I added to the bacon while near the end of browning: 1/2 white onion (diced) 2 garlic cloves (minced) 2 Serrano peppers (seeded & diced) and 2 jalapeno peppers (seeded & diced). I saut\u00e9ed these with the bacon until all was tender and the bacon browned. I doubled the cream of potato soup rather than also adding cream of mushroom. I doubled the amount of corn and used Mexican corn instead of plain and added 1/4 c of heavy cream in addition to 2% milk. I also added coriander cumin and oregano to the mixture and eliminated the curry powder. This was truly amazing... one of the best dishes I've ever made!",

I should have used just 1-10oz can of creamed corn (I used that and a 5oz can of reg. corn - which was too much) because I wanted the soup to have more corn. Then I added extra spicy pepper and salt and pepper to taste - and definitly did not use a full cup! I think this recipe would be good for a slow cooker and it also works well to mash it (good for folks who've just had their wisdom teeth removed and can't chew - which is why I made the recipe).",
