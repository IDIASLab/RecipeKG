I also used only 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon. I added one whole can of beans 1 1/2 onions 3/4 cups bulgur and 4 beef bouillon cubes. I did not add the mint.

I did this in my slow cooker with bison stew meat instead of lamb.

I cooked it on high for 3 hours and on low for two more and added the bulgur during the last 30 minutes of cooking time and I added the parsley right before serving. It was a tasty rainy day meal. Next time I'll probably thicken it with tomato paste toward the end.",
