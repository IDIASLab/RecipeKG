I was in a pinch for bringing a dish to a party and happened to have most of the ingredients for this so I pulled it together, and it's my new favorite recipe.  I did substitute the cream for 2 cups half & half and one cup nonfat evaporated milk (ROFL, that makes it healthier, right?) and I used frozen spinich instead of fresh and I'm sure fresh would make it even better.  I also used diced portobello mushrooms and plain ol' chicken breasts.  Everyone ate this all gone and were fighting for the recipe.  Thanks a ton (and you know where that ton came from ;))\n\n*Edited to add~  I made this again and used fat free half and half and 98% fat free creame of mushroom soup, skim mozzarella and lowfat ricotta, and it tastes just as good as the original.  I also omitted the mushrooms and used sundried tomotoes....yummy!  Still a favorite recipe for special occassions around here.  I've also found it's good to take it out after it's done and let it sit, covered, for a good thirty minutes to thicken up.",

                "reviewBody": "This is an excellent recipe.  To overcome the issue with the volume of spinach (I used 1 - 6oz. bag of fresh baby spinach leaves which worked out to be the perfect amount without overwhelming the dish... or kids ~ nice green speckles here and there), I added the spinach to the skillet of sauteed veggies at the last moment before turning off the heat  to slightly wilt the spinach.  This way all of the prepared ingredients fit perfectly into the 9\" x 13\" dish without the oozing that I've read about in other reviews. I also used a whole medium sized onion and the whole 5oz. package of sliced mushrooms from the produce dept.  This worked out perfectly for flavor, not to mention nothing wasted.  The mushroom slices (as  opposed to chopped) made it a lot easier for my little mushroom hater to pick them out.  Allow the dish to rest at least 15 minutes after removing it from the oven to allow it to settle for easier cutting and serving.  The sauce would be great as a base for other pasta dishes too.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again.  Thanks for posting it!",

The blandness that others commented on may be because there isn't much salt called for in the recipe. I may try it again with alfredo sauce packets instead because this sauce still tastes like canned cream of mushroom soup to me, even though I followed the directions exactly. The final product was a little runny because, when you put the spinach in fresh and then bake it, it exudes a lot of water into the ricotta layer underneath. In order for this lasagna to be worth the effort, it needs a few changes. But it has potential.",

I put the fresh spinach and the mushrooms in the food processor so my kids wouldn't really notice it.  I then put all of that in a pan, along with the chicken, diced tomatoes, chopped onions, and some frozen peas and sauted it with garlic powder, onion powder, adobe, and oregano.  I then added that chicen mixture to the sauce.  THE WHOLE PAN IS GONE!  My kids were fighting over who was going to take leftovers to school.  I had some leftover sauce so I am going to boil some fettucine and make a cassarole with the noodles, sauce, ricotta, and mozzarella.  Can't wait to eat it!",

At one point it calls to use half then the rest then the remaining? Doesn't add up and I read the thing over and over but didn't catch that error until it called for the non-existant \"remaining\" ricotta. Oh well it still looks very good and the way it smells it HAS to be great!",
