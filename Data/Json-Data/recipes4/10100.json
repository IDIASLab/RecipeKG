Dropping it by rounded tablespoons is much easier. Secondly it takes longer than 8 to 10 minutes...it took me about 13 or 14 to finally get the center to stop being so doughy. Third it is a little too sweet just a little. Half a cup of chopped pecans takes the edge off and I added 2/3 cup of toasted coconut for extra flavor. With a little tweaking this is one great cookie!",

Used white chocolate pudding instead of butterscotch and added 1/3 cup of coconut in addition to the oatmeal. They're great if you like a VERY sweet cookie. My kids love them! They were fairly greasy. Next time I'll try using 1/4 cup of oil.",

I used a BUTTER PECAN mix butterscotch pudding and BUTTERSCOTCH CHIPS. I also had an egg yolk and some egg wash from a bread I had made so measured 1/4 of the egg wash and threw in along with the egg yolk. I therefore added about 1/3 cup more oatmeal. Used a combo vanilla and butter flavor extract. These scooped out so easily on the cookie sheet using a cookie scoop and even with a medium scoop they make alot. Did not spread much so can put alot on each sheet without fear of overcrowding. The taste is great and does not taste like cakemix at all. Tastes like there is a ton of carmel or brown sugar and butter in them. Yum. Also threw in 1/3 cup of raisins and that was a nice addition. Very nice.",

I made according to the recipe except I used a DH German Chocolate mix and added about 1/2 cup of pecans. These were absolutely wonderful. Super fudgy and no one would guess how quick and easy these were to make. I used a cookie scoop and got 2 sheets of cookies. These took about 12 minutes to bake. Previous review of 12/05: These were very quick and easy. I used a Duncan Hines spice cake mix and French vanilla pudding. In addition to the chocolate chips I added some pecans and a handful of white chocolate chips. I was skeptical about the recipe not calling for any eggs but they were perfect in texture...they didn't spread too much and the next day are still crisp on the edges and chewy in the middle. Because of the extra ingredients I added I had to press everything together so it would stay in a ball when placed on the cookie sheet but it was worth it because the pecans are great with the spice flavor. I used a cookie scoop and baked them about 10 minutes.",
