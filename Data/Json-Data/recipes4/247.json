After reading the other reviews here are the changes I made: I also used 10-slices of real bacon drained and crumbled. I added a big handful of shredded cheddar cheese (\"mexican blend\") and a dash of garlic powder (plus the onion and black pepper called for in the recipe). I did not have any crescent rolls so I used the small 10-count refrigerator biscuits. I pinched each biscuit in half and put them in my mini-muffin pan and pressed them up the sides of each muffin cup. I put the cheese/bacon filling in one of my cake decorating disposable bags and cut off the tip and squeezed a big dollop of filling into each biscuit cup. Baked for about 12 minutes until the biscuits looked done.... VERY YUMMY!!! I will definitely make these again. Thanks Holli!",
