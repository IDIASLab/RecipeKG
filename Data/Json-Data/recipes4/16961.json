I cover them with another piece of parchment paper for the 15 minutes at 400 then I turn down the heat to 250 and bake them for about an hour. I usually make 2 batches at a time. They come out really crispy. After you roll them out you can also sprinkle any seasoning on them. Sometimes I use a spicy one to kick it up. Love these.",

Full disclosure: We did substitute 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/2 tsp garlic powder for the original 1 tsp garlic powder. We rolled out the dough to about 1/16\" instead of 1/8\". Make sure you don't add all of the water at once. You want the dough workable and not wet. If it is too wet, just add more almond flour. Once rolled out, you can add some cayenne pepper or ground Rosemary or whatever suits you. Didn't do it this time, though we'll try it next time! We baked at 400 F (200 C) for 15 minutes and then turned the oven off, leaving the tray inside for another 30 minutes. Crackers were very crisp and would hold up to the thickest of dips. A real go to cracker recipe!",

I served these with a variety of hummus (cool ranch peanut butter and sundried tomato) at Thanksgiving and they were gone before I could mix the ingredients for a second batch. I made them with cashew meal instead of almond as that is what I had on hand and used nutritional yeast instead of cheese for the first batch. The second batch I used cashew and goat cheddar. I don't think you can go wrong with any combination. The next time I make these I will try adding Rosemary to see how that works.",
