I had 1/2\" to 3/4\" boneless chops and baked them for 50 min.(took them out 10 min's early). The cheese (used vermont cheddar and provolone) got REALLY cooked. I don't understand how everyone else's came out tender after an HOUR even if they had 1\" or better chops! I do plan on making this again but I will only bake 35 min's. and I will add the second cheese 10 min's before it's done. I crumbled the cooked bacon on top then vermont cheddar then provolone. My kids really liked the taste and they don't like pork chops normally. I'm sure with the shorter bake time they will be FABULOUS! UPDATE I tried this again with the same cheezes but cooked 25 min's added the mozz/prov cheese and cooked for 10 more min's. Came out FANTASTIC. I used bone in center cut chops this time too.",

I did make a couple of enhancements that were suggested by others:  I seered the pork chops in the bacon fat and used shredded cheddar and Jack cheese on top.  (Couldn't bring myself to use \"cheez-wiz\".) The chops I used were very thick (~1\").  The people who said these were dry probably over-cooked them.  You have to be very careful with pork chops, they cook quickly and tend to be dry if overdone.  Seering helps to trap in the juices.  Anyway, we enjoyed these and maybe now I won't get faces and rolling eyeballs when I say we're having pork chops for dinner.",

I added garlic powder and black pepper and I browned the chops in the same pan that I used for partially cooking the bacon.  I lined the baking pan with foil before putting it in the oven for a fast and easy clean-up.  My husband and I both just loved these chops and I will be preparing them on a regular basis.  Thanks so much for the fantastic recipe!!",

I also used cheddar instead of cheez-whiz...I just couldn't bring myself to use it.  I seasoned my chops with garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper.  Then I browned them in the bacon grease left from cooking the bacon.  Placed them in a baking pan, poured a small amount of beef broth in the bottom of the pan (hoping that would keep them from drying out), and baked for 30 minutes.  I pulled them out, topped with bacon and cheese and baked for 10 minutes more to melt the cheese.  My chops were tender and juicy.  They were exactly 1 in. thick, boneless chops.  They were not dry at all.  I recommend keeping an eye on them and not cooking for the full hour unless they REALLY need it!  Thanks for the recipe!",

I put shredded cheddar on top because that's what I had.  And my only addition was about 10 minutes before done I put a little bit of Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce on top.  Next time I make them I will make them exactly as I did this time.  Give them a try...totally worth it!",

It is even better when you use the cheese sauce that is left over as a dipping sauce. My husband says this is a keeper and I agree. Thank you for the recipe.",
