I'm thinking the difference in our opinions has more to do with bf liking the sausage I used more than I like it. I changed this a bit bc bc didn't want me to do the roux so I didn't and I wanted to put it in the crockpot. So I put everything except the chickpeas and pasta in let it cook for several hours then added the chickpeas about 45 mins before and the pasta about 10 mins before serving. Worked perfectly although I accidently dumped in more pasta than it called for. Thanks for the recipe!",

I also cook my garbanzo beans in the crockpot overnight on high to get them as soft as possible. Also i never add any salt or ground black pepper because it's got enough spice with the crushed red and the chicken stock has plenty of salt. Hands down one of my favorite meals",
