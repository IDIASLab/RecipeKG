At the suggestion of Kathi Lipp's podcast I've started keeping a baggie in the freezer for veggie scraps ( the tough ends of asparagus trimmed celery carrots etc.). When I make a bone broth I add the contents of that bag to my pressure cooker plus enough water to cover bones and vegetables. This cuts down on food waste and adds a great depth of flavor. Unlike the Organic bone broth I usually buy this bone broth is delicious on it's own. In fact I surprised myself by having a cup for lunch the day I made it. It's that good!",

I thought the time of 120 minutes in the IP was excessive as the other recipe I tried was only 30 minutes. So I compromised with 60 minutes which made a rich stock thicker than the broth I usually make. Also the bones were starting to disintegrate. I had to strain several times to get a consistency I liked. 120 minutes would have made a very rich stock so I guess it's up to you how rich you want yours to be. Also 2 teaspoons of turmeric seemed like a lot to me in the end product.",
