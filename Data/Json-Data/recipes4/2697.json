I did cut the recipe back to 2 servings and I used a handheld julianne cutter I recently bought and wanted to try out. My other main issue is that I had major trouble with sticking. The one closest to the heat source burned half the potato to the foil. I used a little olive oil instead of PAM spray maybe that is really needed here? To the credit of the submitter I have never made a foil packet recipe. I also used a small propane grill. I would attempt this again if camping for instance. What I could salvage cooked through and tasted fine. However I would be saving it for breakfast. These would be a good idea with those pre-cubed type potatoes.",
