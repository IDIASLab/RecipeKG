It also happens to be gluten free, thanks to tapioca flour, which is also responsible for the very unique texture. Happily, the ingredients are fairly inexpensive, which means you can play around with a few batches and see for yourself.",

First, he uses only one egg in the video but the recipe calls for two. The reason is that for the video he only made 1/2 batch. It's easy to miss that part. Second, you can't substitute ANYTHING for the tapioca flour/starch (both names are used on packaging, however, the product is exactly the same. Names are interchangeable) \n\nHaving said that, this recipe is by far the easiest recipe I have ever made vs. the output. Never have I had so many compliments and pleas to make more for a recipe that required only 4-7 minutes of EASY prep. I used my KitchenAid mixer with the paddle attachment but did not vary anything else.\nThese are amazing!",

Rather than starting over, I went to step 2 like an idiot.\nI continued to follow the steps and mixed everything except the eggs. At that point, I heated everything until I felt they were warm enough and then mixed in the eggs.\n\nDespite the butchering, the Pao de Queijo turned out quite pretty! I probably doubled the size since my ice cream scooper was weirdly shaped. The taste wasn't as cheesy as the ones I've had at Brazilian steakhouses but I'm not sure if it's me using less ingredients or if it's because of my mistake. The texture it's exactly like the ones in the restaurants though. Everyone still enjoyed it and I can't wait to redo this!",
