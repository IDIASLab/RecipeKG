For an even creamier richer pop use half the water. My preference was to also use half the Agave and no salt. I liked using Agave because I didn't have to make a simple syrup. Don't forget to lightly bang your pop mold on the counter a few times to 'burp' out any air bubbles. Great recipe that is an ideal way to use extra avocados and is easily adjustable to personal taste.",

I keep thinking that they are like vegan creamsicles. My mother-in-law has a recipe for vegan chocolate pudding that is basically avocado maple syrup a bit of lime juice and a bunch of cocoa powder to taste. I think you could make vegan fudgesicles using this concept just by adding some water to thin. Will be making again / experimenting with the inspiration!",
