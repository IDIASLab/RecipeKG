I added 1/4 c. chopped onion; 1 clove garlic, chopped; and 1 stalk celery sliced; and 1/2 t. Seasoned salt; 1/2 t. Italian Seasonings; and 1/4 t. pepper.  After cooking the vegetables, I realized the remaining broth was not going to make enough sauce, so I also added one package of brown gravy mix, prepared, to the final sauce, and added a splash of red cooking wine.  Instead of just frozen peas, I added 1/2 c. frozen corn as well.  I pre-baked the bottom crust for about 7 minutes and it came out nice and flaky, not at all mushy.  I added sliced mushrooms to the top of the vegetables in the pie before putting on the top crust.  \n\nThe one thing I didn't do, but will next time is layer the vegetables and sauce in the final assembly.  I had just put the sauce over all the vegetables and it didn't soak through like I would have liked.  This recipe probably would have been great with a lot less tinkering by me, but it came out wonderful even after playing with it.",

I cooked until beef was done and veggies were tender.  Then I put it in a 9x13 pan, and dropped biscuits on top.  I baked at 350 until the biscuits were done.  We all loved it.

First, I added some seasoning (rosemary, sage, white pepper, thyme) to the raw meat before searing (locks in some flavorful juices).  Then,  I used a combination of water and dry red wine to stew the meat (skim any scum off).  I removed the meat after it was done then cooked my vegetables in the same liquid as the beef (add water & salt as necessary) .  By doing this it will give you a better tasting gravy which will need less cornstarch because the vegetable starches which will help to act as a thickening agent.  Adjust the salt, white pepper and seasonings to taste.  I also added sliced mushrooms at the end.  I have found that if you increase your vegetables slightly, you will have enough for 2 pies.   I used a homemade double crust to which I added about a teaspoon each of dried rosemary, thyme and some pinches of salt & white pepper to the flour before cutting in the shortening. It really makes a big difference.",

Since I was going to be freezing my pies, I didn't precook the veggies at all (didn't even thaw them!), just added them into the pie and covered with gravy--it was a lot easier!  I also added some undiluted cream mushroom soup and dry brown gravy mix to the sauce, and was then able to omit the cornstarch.  My family enjoyed this a lot, even my 19-month-old!  Thanks",
