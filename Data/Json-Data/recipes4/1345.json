Bring broth to a boil with 1T sherry, 1T soy sauce, 2 scallions cut in 1 inch pieces, 1-1 inch piece of fresh ginger, 1 clove garlic crushed. Let steep a few minutes to flavor broth.  Remove garlic, ginger and scallions.  Thicken with cornstarch (add more cornstarch if you like it nice and thick as we do).  Stir broth while simmering in clockwise directions. Add beaten eggs (I use 6 eggs for 4 or 5 cups broth)  in slow steady stream and let cook undisturbed (important) until cooked (about a minute or so).  If you add eggs before it's thickened the eggs will puff when cooked and will not cook to ribbons (like restaurant style).  Garnish with finely sliced scallions if desired and crispy noodles.  Yummy! Will fulfill that takeout craving.",
