I don't have an instant pot - anyone else using this with a standard stovetop pressure cooker should know that it will cook at 10 lbs pressure for 20 minutes and let the pressure drop naturally taking it off the burner. If you need it after 10 minutes you can release it then otherwise let it sit to no pressure. I didn't make any changes except to increase amounts proportionately. I did however use our homemade merlot wine and our homemade tomato paste along with homegrown veggies and spices - yum!!! The beef came from the store.:D Thanks for a wonderful addition to my recipe collection!",
