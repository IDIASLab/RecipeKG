I'm not a fan of the way the pasta absorbs all of the dressing though. If I made this again I think I'd dress it just prior to serving. I also chose to use dill relish as opposed to sweet per personal preference. THANKS for the recipe!",

In my case since I was only making this for Hubs and me it didn't make sense to open a jar of pimiento even tho' I know that would have contributed excellent flavor. I substituted red bell pepper which added the same bright red color as well as some additional crunch. The sweet pickle relish didn't move me but I agreed it could use a little flavor punch so I added some Marie's Ranch Salad Dressing along with the mayonnaise. I love raw onion but didn't add it as I didn't want to taste it hours later! I didn't measure anything just added ingredients in amounts that looked right to me.",
