Use instead 4 cups of broth as a substitute for the cubes and water... it works wonderfully. If you don't care about it being vegetarian I suggest using (Mexican) chorizo sausage in place of vegetarian \"sausage\" (another hideously artifical invention). Chorizo worked great (cook it first and add at the end) and made it super spicy! If you want vegetarian soup add an extra cup of onion for body and leave out the veggie sausage.",
