I have been making these for over twenty five years and they are always a big hit. They are relatively small made the way the recipe is written. If you would like you can make them larger just by dividing the dough circles by four or six. They are always well received and they freeze very easily. Both after you bake them or before. For before just place them on a cookie sheet in the freezer. When frozen keep them in a plastic bag in the freezer and thaw them when ready to bake. Enjoy!!",

I'll also mix the butter and cottage cheese better so they are smoother. These would be good with some herbs added---I'm thinking dill or thyme would pair well. Here's what I did about the stickiness of the dough. I put my dough ball on parchment paper and flattened it out quite a bit for the refrigeration. Then I rolled it out and they were not rolling up the way they should so I just put the thin circle back in the fridge for about fifteen more minutes. That's all it took! I baked them 19 minutes before they looked like my photo. Thanks for the recipe! EDIT: I had trouble reheating these. I need to try them again! Just a warning!:)",

I know I cooked them long enough--any longer and the bottoms would have been burned even with parchment paper and still found them gummy...not like the crescent I was expecting...",
