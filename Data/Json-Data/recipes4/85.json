Not easy to prepare but worth the money and time to invest if you know the technique how to prepare this one. Best if you have someone to teach you because it is tricky. Flour quality oven how much filling you use on one layer how thin is one layer.. you need to figure it out.. be patient and don't panic if you need to throw it out at the first one-two-three time.. You will know how to do it at the fourth.. I know it is wasting time and money but believe me..It worth it!",

The filling was watery and never set - even after refrigerating for several hours. There are much better Zserbo recipes available elsewhere.",
