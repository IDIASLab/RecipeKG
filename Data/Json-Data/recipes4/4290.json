And just as an fyi... using lime juice instead of lime leaves does not work as a substitution.  A kaffir lime leaf tastes and is used more like our bay leaf, not a lime.  Just to simplify, here is my ingredient list:\n\nPanang Curry paste / Lite coconut milk / Crunchy Peanut butter / (to make a substitute for Kaffir lime leaves, use 1/3 of each:  lime zest, fresh thyme and a bay leaf.  Use lemon thyme if available.) / Brown Sugar / Hoisin Sauce / Fresh basil chiffonade / Red Pepper / Green Pepper / chicken breast / Lime juice / Jasmine rice.   The crunchy peanut butter adds another Thai dimension that just \"makes\" this dish, IMO. (not sure if it changes the name of the dish.. but who cares!?!)   The kaffir lime leaf substitution took some research and is a wonderful replacement trick.  This dish is ridiculously easy to make, and so impressive!  Not to mention sooooo good.

This recipe is almost exactly what he described to me, except he had me cook the curry with the heavy cream on the top of the coconut can until heated, then add the chicken to cook.  Finally add the rest of the coconut can (the thinner liquid in the bottom of the can) with the remaining ingredients.  Finally, when removed from heat, add cut sweet peppers and broccoli...YUM!!!  \nNeedless to say, I WILL be returning to this restaurant again and again...\nDelicious!!",
