I think you can get away with 1/2 that amount. 1/2 cup would be more than enough. A full cup was way too buttery! When I made the sauce I did not use 5 cups of milk either as I knew that would not fit into a 9x13 dish. I made 1/2 the recipe called for and still couldn't fit it all in the dish. I also added peas for veges. The flavor was just okay but I do think it would be a hit with kids maybe. I think some fresh sage would help it be less bland. I'm sorry it wasn't for us.",
