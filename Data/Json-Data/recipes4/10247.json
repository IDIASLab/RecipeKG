I did this over 5 weeks, with a different test substitution.  The successful substitutions included: brown rice, elimination of the mushroom soup and using a whole can of Campbell's healthy request chicken soup, reducing the cheese by one cup and using a 75% reduced fat cheddar cheese instead of the two types of cheese.  The dish continued to be the favorite of the class after each substitution.  Hope everyone tries these easy substitutions!",

Added one can of minced ortega chilis, 1 tsp of minced garlic (such as Spice World) and 1 tsp of cumin to the soup (used healthy request/low sodium soup) mixture and then proceded to follow the directions.  Substituted 1 cup of the Montery Jack for Pepper Jack cheese for an extra flavor boost.  DEFINITELY much more flavorful!",

I did tweak it a little bit, but stuck to the basics: I sauteed the onion along with some bell pepper, celery, and minced garlic.  Instead of doing the alternating layers, I put all of the rice in first, then the chicken, then the soup mixture, then the cheese. I also didn't use as much cheese as the recipe called for - I only used about a cup at the most. I took another reviewer's advice and covered it with foil for the first 30 minutes then uncovered for the remaining 10 minutes. It turned out great, with a bit of sour cream on top. I think I will make this again, and maybe add a can of corn and possibly some black beans. I also agree with another review that said this would be good as a filler for burritos.  I think I'll try that today for lunch.  :) Thanks so much for sharing!",

First I like to cook my chicken with flavor so I seasoned it with salt pepper and garlic powder.I then mixed the soups and rotel (didn't have salsa). I used this mixture instead of water to cook my chicken. I cooked it on medium stirring frequently so the mixture wouldn't scorch on the bottom. I removed the chicken and diced. I mixed all the rice and soup mixture together and then added the chicken. I topped it with cheese (I reduced the amount to save a few calories) and popped it into the oven. By the way this recipe makes a ton. We will be having this for lunch today and dinner tonight.",
