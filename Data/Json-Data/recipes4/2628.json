This recipe may look a bit complicated, but I promise you--it is not. Chicken can be cooked on the stove or on a grill. It is great for large family gatherings and does not really need to be served with anything other than a good loaf of bread for sopping up the juices. I hope your family enjoys this as much as mine has.",

I also marinated the tomatoes in the olive oil (also cut that in half) and the balsamic vinegar along with some minced garlic salt pepper 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes and chopped fresh basil. While the pasta was boiling I sauteed 1/2 c. of chopped onion then added the tomatoe mixture and let that warm up just a bit. Tossed that in with the chicken and pasta and topped it with a little parmesan cheese - delicious!",

I didn't have time to marinate the chicken 2 hours so here is what I did: I combined the balsamic vinegar and olive oil and set the chicken in there for about 30 min. Meanwhile I chopped the garlic and sauteed with mushrooms and two dried basil leaves (didn't have fresh) until brown. I browned the chicken then added the garlic mushrooms and basil back in as well as 2 cans of diced tomatoes (1 fire roasted and 1 italian). I let this cook and simmer for about 15 min and served with pasta. It was delish.",
