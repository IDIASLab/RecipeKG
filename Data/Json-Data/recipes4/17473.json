Being a long time vegetarian, I have never had Chipotle's chicken, but we split half the marinade for his chicken and I use the other half to braise tofu, and it is wonderful.  We've made it several times, and the only step we change is using canned chipotle peppers in adobo, mainly because I forgot to buy dried ones in bulk.  We weigh them and it works just fine as a substitution.",
