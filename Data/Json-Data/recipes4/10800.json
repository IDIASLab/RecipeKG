We have an over abundance of potatoes at our house and after eating this tonight my husband literally asked if we could have it again tomorrow night and if we could use the other 10 pounds of potatoes!:) He was over exaggerating of course but they are so very good! The only thing I would say to do that I didn't do is spray the foil with PAM or something like that before you put the potatoes down. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thanks!!",

Then placed cheese and 3/4 c. milk in another microwave bowl and heated until cheese was melted; added ranch dressing mix and poured over potatoes and microwaved for another 3 minutes with lid on.  Let set about 5 minutes to complete the cooking process.  Note that I left butter out completely which reduced the fat content and also reduced the salty taste.  Husband LOVED them!  Will definitely make again.",
