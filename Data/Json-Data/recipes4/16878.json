I didn't dust them with powdered sugar, just topped them with Hershey Hugs. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that it is a little overly sweet to me, and I have a sweet tooth. It's possible a different brand of brownie mix might tone that down a little, but I'm not sure? Be sure to transfer the cookies to a plate before gently topping with the Kisses; they'll still be warm enough that it's easy to push through the bottom of the cookie if they're still on the cooling rack.",
