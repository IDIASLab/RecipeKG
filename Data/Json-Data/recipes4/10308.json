The part I like about it best is that I was easily able to convert it to a low carb version for my diabetic father by substituting the whipped topping with lite cool whip and the gelatin with sugar-free jello... and better yet it still tastes good and is very satisfying! I'll definitely be sharing this with others!",

Also, the lemon flavor is not that strong.  To make this recipe a little more appealing I added 1 tsp lemon zest, the juice of 1 lemon & 1 package of cream cheese.  This gives it a smoother texture and the little extra lemon kick it lacked.",

The key to this recipe though is how and when you blend it. The first time I made it I just used a spatula and mixed the whipped topping in to the mostly cooled jello until it melted together. The pie was great. Creamy. The third time I made it I was in a hurry and I used my electric mixer for several minutes the jello was not cooled enough and voila it was gelatinous and not very good. So important: let the jello cool before adding the whipped topping and don't go overboard with the mixing or you will get a rubber pie.",
