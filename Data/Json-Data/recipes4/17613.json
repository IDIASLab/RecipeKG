I also use a whole bone in turkey breast that I removed the skin from. The bacon provides more than enough fat to keep the turkey moist. I used applewood wood chips on my gas grill and slow smoked this at about 250-325 degrees for several hours until I reached an internal temp of 165 F.\n\nTHIS WAS THE BEST TURKEY I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE! Perfectly moist and tender. Flavorful. Wonderful. Sublime. Served with homemade mac and cheese, Hawaiian dinner rolls, and finely chopped sauteed Brussel sprouts with bacon. Paired with a nice Italian Prosecco and a French Vouvray.",
