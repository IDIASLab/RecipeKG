I doubled the amount of spices but left out the cinnamon, and used 4 big cloves of minced, fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.  I cut the roast into large chunks so the spices could penetrate the meat better and it worked like a charm. Finally, to make these more authentic, after shredding the meat into smaller chunks I spread it out in a thin layer on a cookie sheet and baked it in a 400 degree oven about 20 minutes, just long enough to crisp the exterior of the meat. Great on it's own, but in a tortilla with a little of the \"Avocado Salad with Bacon and Sour Cream\" this was just over the top good. The meat was tender and perfectly seasoned, keeping in mind, however, that I doubled up on the spices. We are looking forward to having the leftovers again tomorrow night!",

I then added 1/4 cup of chili sauce and 2 tbsp sugar and poured the sauce over the pork.\n\nServed the whole thing as part of a make-your-own taco bar for my boyfriend's birthday and not a bit was leftover!",

Since some reviewers said the seasoning didn't permeate the entire roast, I cut it into quarters or sometimes a little smaller and then apply the rub. I use a two pound roast with one 14oz can of chicken broth and the stated amt of seasoning. So if I were using a 4 lb roast I would probably double the rub.",

I took another reviewer's advice and cooked it for 6 hours instead of 10.  (I've got one of those crock pots that gives you the option of 4-6-8 or 10 hours, and it automatically adjusts the temp based on how many hours you put in.)  The seasoning was great although once I shredded the meat I did add some salt for some extra flavor.  The leftovers were still nice and tender too.  Thanks for the recipe!!",
