I made them for the super bowl and followed the recipe exactly.  The taste was good but I felt that the soy sauce was a little overpowering and the hot sauce taste was not strong enough.  The sauce was also a little runny and not as spicy as I would have liked.  I prefer a rich and hearty sauce with a little extra bite to it.  When I make these again (which my fiends will kill me if I don't) I wont actually cut down on the soy sauce used but instead double the amount of hot sauce used and possibly melt some butter into the sauce as well.",
