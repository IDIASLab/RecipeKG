Looks delicious and inspiring for the summer time!\n(Later that day) I made it  just like the recipe and loved it. Next time I am going to try the variation with some different fruits! I also like the suggestion to use honey  instead of the maple syrup but is that just on the topping or can honey be used in the batter? I am doubling the recipe so to make a Flag design with the blueberries, strawberries and bananas for the 4th of July!",
