Loved the cream cheese/shrimp mixture - I used medium shrimp as I like their flavor better than the tiny shrimp regular cream cheese chopped fresh chives and just a tiny bit of minced onion. Romano cheese is quite pungent so I used just a light sprinkling of Parmesan instead. A sprinkling of finely chopped fresh parsley prettied these up. Very good!",

These were gone when I brought the dish home and everyone raved about them!  The only thing that I did differently was add a little Old Bay to the mixture and then sprinkle a Mozzarella and Provolone before baking!  These are definitely the appetizers that I will take to events from now on!  Very, very comparable to Red Lobster's seafood stuffed mushrooms!\n\nA year later and these are still the very best appetizer I have ever made!  Everyone who tries them, loves them!  You simply cannot go wrong with this recipe!",
