We used Egg Beaters, reduced fat swiss cheese (Jarlsberg Lite), and fat free condensed milk.  I highly suggest that you use a deep dish pie crust.  We also had to bake it for an additional 15 minutes.  It came out very tasty and we will make this recipe again.",

First of all only half of the leeks and cheese mixture fit into my deep-dish pie crust. Secondly the recipe recommends seasoning with salt and pepper as the last step--this was a mistake since the tomatoes soaked up all of the salt and made for a very unpleasant taste. And lastly my quiche took twice as long to bake--and even then it was more like a soup. We threw the whole thing away and ate leftovers.",
