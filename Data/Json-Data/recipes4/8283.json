This didn't get as brown as I would have liked but I suppose that is due to keeping them healthy and baking them in the oven instead of deep frying. Don't skip the freezing step because it definitely needs this. Overall great recipe and a healthier alternative.",

That way the oil was lighter and more evenly distributed than it would've been with drizzled olive oil. I left mine in for a few minutes longer - about seven minutes total. Lastly, I can't say why, but I think the flour step makes a big difference. The egg and breadcrumbs seem to bond better.",
