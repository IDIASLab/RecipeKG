When I put the flour into the cream, it immediately made a very thick paste.  I think maybe there is a typo in the amount of flour, and I would start with half a teaspoon and work up.  I didn't want my rating to deter anyone from trying this!  I put this with Easy Crispy Baked Chicken from this site, and we had a marvelous dinner!  Thank you!",

I also didn't have heavy whipping cream so I used 2 cups of milk and 3/4 cup half & half with about 4 tablespoons of flour to make up for the liquid. I wanted more of a sauce and when I only added the 3/4 cup of half & half it was totally not a sauce. Which is why I added the 2 cups milk. Anyways. It was delicious and I loved it!!

My version created as a sauce for cheese ravioli was one box of mushrooms sliced with 1-1/2 cups of half and half and 6 t. flour 3 T Parmesan and 3 T butter as the base cooking the mushrooms in the butter before adding all ingredients. This provided enough for three generous servings of sauce over ravioli. I also added a tough of a mix of fresh-ground sea salt and garlic.",

The taste (with shiitake - lobster mushrooms are difficult to find) was very good, but a few tweaks the second time made it better. After cooking the mushrooms, I added the shallot and stirred over the heat for two minutes. Then, I added the flour and stirred again over the heat for another two minutes. This was to help the raw taste of the flour to become more rounded in the finished sauce. I added 2 Tb of beef stock (chicken would be all right, too, and will give a lighter flavor) to the heavy cream, then proceeded with the rest of the recipe as written. These measures only added a few minutes to prep time, but deepened the flavor to an intriguing complexity that remarkably complemented the steak over which it was served. It drew rave reviews .",
