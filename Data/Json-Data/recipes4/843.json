I also had a couple of people say they don't care for spinach but heard others saying how good they were so they tried them and they loved them too. I did follow several of the suggestions offered by other members. I thawed and squeezed dry the spinach before beginning.  I cut the Italian bread crumbs to 1 cup. I used one med. yellow onion (instead of the green onions) and 2 cloves of minced garlic and sauteed those in the 1/2 cup butter. I also took another recommendation and added about 1/3 cup of crumbled bacon.\nI made them no larger than 1 inch and they took every bit of 30 minutes to achieve the light brown. They weren't over cooked in the center at all. They were no where close to being done at 15 minutes. I'd definitely make these again. They were delicious and very well received. But for me they took considerably longer to make and considerably longer to bake than stated in the menu. Partially due to my additions. No matter. They're worth the time either way!",

I froze the rest for a dinner party this week.  I added some cayenne and garlic powder to this recipe and rolled them in fresh grated parmesan before baking as suggested.  I didn't serve a dipping sauce, but I have some pizza sauce left in my refrigerator that I'm going to heat up for my company this week.  I'm going to pull them out of the freezer in advance so they'll thaw since I don't know if I can bake them frozen or not.  Very easy, and definitely a keeper for the freezer. -- P.S. I pulled them out of the freezer the other night and let them defrost before baking them for my guests.  I find that either fresh or defrosted, they need 15 minutes to cook.  They were fabulous, and all of my guests loved them!",

I took them to a potluck of about 40 people but few people ate them. A friend of mine (who ate 6) said people just didn't know what they were. Next time I'll label them.

                "reviewBody": "I love this recipe and all the modifications others have made to suit their tastes.  Here's what we do:  I double the frozen spinach to four 10oz. packages (for more spinach flavor).  Substitute 1 cup of the bread crumbs with 1 cup of blanched almond flour (for lower carbs) and add some extra Italian seasoning to that.  Use 1/4 cup of finely diced white or yellow onion instead of green onion and use 2 whole eggs plus 2 x-lrg egg whites (for less sat fat).  I think the butter adds the richness needed, so I leave that as is.  I don't usually add garlic, b/c I don't want to saute anything for this easy recipe, but I have added garlic raw and a little goes a long way.  A little fresh grated nutmeg (1/4 tsp) is wonderful in this as well.  I usually cook up a  few for our meal that day and then roll out the rest onto a baking sheet lined with parchment and freeze (uncooked) individually on that. Once frozen I transfer them to a freezer bag.  They cook up beautifully from frozen in 25 minutes.  Great to have on hand when company arrives unexpected.   Will have to try them with the recommended Sangiovese, but have served with Sauvignon Blanc very successfully.  I have made this recipe as written and they are fabulous.  But the beauty of them is that they CAN be modified quite successfully to your tastes.  Don't pass this one up!",
