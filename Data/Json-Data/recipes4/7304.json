So that being said it was a hit! I agree with another reviewer that 8 slices of bacon is way too much so I would recommend decreasing. In contrast to others I did not use a bag to cover the asparagus with the oil (because didn't want another thing to clean and trying to save the earth). I used a basting brush to coat the asparagus. Have to try this again so that I can actually taste it.",
