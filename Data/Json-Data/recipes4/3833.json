Lower heat to medium, add onion, chicken and garlic and cook for another 10 minutes stirring occasionally. Add salt and pepper to taste. Very good.

I seasoned the vegetables with powdered ginger ground cardamom and 'Emeril's Original Essence' spice blend along with some fresh ground pepper and salt as the recipe called for. 4.
