I have never tasted any thing so good in my life that compared to real mexican food.  THANKS SO MUCH..... now if can just get those Fajita's to taste the same as there's, I will be in good shape :)",

Also I prepared it in a pressure cooker (in less than an hour cookin time, the meat was falling-apart tender!).  I thought it was quite tasty and will make it again.  Next time, I will use only 1/2 the tomato paste (1/4 can), or possibly susbtitute tomato sauce instead.  I thought that he amount of tomato paste listed added a strong tangy tomato taste that I would have liked to taste LESS.  With that simple change, I think this recipe would warrant 5 PLUS stars.\n\nNew info!  I also tried dredging the meat in flour before browning and omitting cornstarch (and potato) and it thickened quite nicely. Hope this helps someone!",

I dredged my meat in seasoned flour, then browned in oil with chopped onions. I added the rest of the ingredients in the crock pot and cooked all day. Absolutely divine. Slice some fresh avocados and chopped tomatoes for a fresh accompaniment on your tacos. I also made it with corn/poblano white rice and with the richness of the gravy you really need a bland or mild rice to go along with it. If I could give this ten stars I would :).",
