I am not jewish but I did have a couple over for last night who happen to be jewish and he is strictly on a kosher diet and a vegetarian and the other well is jewish as well but isnt as strict in her diet. So I said \"what the heck let me try this out\". And I am so glad I did. I ended up using about 2 small-medium sized eggplants. I am so glad I used the matzo meal instead of bread crumbs. I think that is something that I will be using often. That was my first time having matzo meal. I didnt just use red pepper I also added a little bit of yellow and green. I also used 2 packages of a mushrooms medley that were mixed with all kind of exotic mushrooms and oooh so yummy. My husband and I love mushrooms especially the mixed medley kind. About 4 bucks a package. The only thing I would do differently is layer the mozzarella between the veggies and eggplant. And 1 package is not enough. I used 2 and I wish I had bought more. But the exciting thing for me was that my guests loved it and even asked for some more to take home with them for lunch tomorrow. I am not kidding! I was like \"sure!\" I was so happy knowing I had pleased my finicky guests lol. It was fun. And would gladly make this again. It was a lot of fin making sort if like a mini art project. I wanted everthing to look perfect! Happy eating people!!! xoxo",
