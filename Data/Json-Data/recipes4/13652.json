In forming the dough 1 cup of white flour was not enough to make the dough workable I probably used an additional cup or so. There was a slight bitterness to the dish overall maybe due to the beer in the beurre blanc and I'm not sure if it was supposed to taste like that.

I have a few comments: The gnocchi were pretty easy to make but there really should be a weight for the squash instead of simply \"one acorn squash\". I think that has a lot to do with the other reviewers having to add more flour. I also added more flour. I can't decide if that made them dense or if they are supposed to be dense! I don't have a garlic press so I minced it. I would suggest substituting garlic powder sauteeing it first or putting it in the sauce instead of the gnocchi. Biting into a pocket of raw garlic isn't so appealing. I used the Creamy Sage Butter Sauce as another reviewer recommended. At any rate I can't stop eating these dense little dumplings.",
