I fried the garlic onion and mushrooms in a little grape seed oil (better for you than olive oil check it out) until softened dumped in the rice and covered with chicken broth. Didnt have Italian seasoning so I substituted with oregano rosemary and a little parsley and ceyenne pepper. When most of the liquid was out of the pan I stired in the peas just to warm them up. Instead of parmesan cheese I grated asiago over top. I will make it this way again.",
