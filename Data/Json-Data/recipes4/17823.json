I sauteed some yellow onion along with the other veggies. I find the carrots and celery take longer to cook to my preferences so I start with cooking them first. After a few minutes I added the chopped onion (used in place of french-fried onions). For the final minute I added the red pepper which I had almost minced. I forgot that I was supposed to add the seasonings to the rice and instead added it to the sauteed veggies and then stirred in the rice. This worked well too. It was an excellent flavor.",
