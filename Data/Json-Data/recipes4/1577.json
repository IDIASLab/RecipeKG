I doubled the sauce but not the onions. It really doesn't taste like Korma, but it is good.  I will make this again.5/20 Update: I made this again and used a whole pint of fat free yogurt and if the spices said 1 tsp, I used 1 TBSP for each spice. Don't put the Turmeric in a plastic food processor, it will stain, wait till after you process it to put in the tumeric. I also processed about 3 TBSP almonds and that helped thicken the sauce. It came out great and tasted more like Korma.",

For our family it had just the right amount of spicy-heat (we're kind of wimpy!). Don't buy your turmeric and garam masala in the spice section of the grocery store go to the Asian section or go to an Asian food market. It will be much less expensive.",

Not at all what I expected, in that several reviews gave the impression it was a spicy dish, which it was not. The only thing I did different was I could not find mango chutney anywhere.  After buying everything else I needed, a friend suggested I substitute with apricot preserves. She's somewhat of a gourmet cook and thought since mango is a sweet fruit, apricots might work in it's place.  The recipe turned out to be very good and I served it over basmati rice as suggested.",

For those of you who failed at making this recipe you gotta make sure that you have the correct chutney. You need to use the SWEET one.

I did NOT use 2 onions though ( would be way too oniony for our tastes) so instead I used one sweet onion and then in place of the other onion I added a can of diced tomatos (drained)...other than that I did everything exact and it was soooooooo yummy and best of all sooooo easy. I made the sauce and poured over chicken in the baking dish covered it put it back in the fridge went to kickboxing class and and hour later cooked it up and wala ready in 1/2 hour. And all that butter and oil is not necessary. Next time I will use just a couple tablespoons of olive oil and then it is super healthy too. Loved it and so did everyone else. Will make again and again. (note: be sure to cook the onions until they are very soft to ensure a nice creamy texture for the sauce) Thanx!",
