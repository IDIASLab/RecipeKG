UPDATE: made this again and realized i was pretty much out of paprika so i subbed chili powder and it was still delicious.. i upped the salt to 3/4 tsp this time and ended up salting my basting liquid to taste.. this has to be one of my favorite ways to make drumsticks.. ty again",

I turned the drumsticks every 15 min and basted them with a brush. I made another batch of the marinade as there was none left over after the chicken marinaded. I didn't boil the extra marinade, I just brushed it on every 15 minutes. The chicken came out perfectly baked, juicy and tender. Boys kids loved it too. Will make this again for sure!",
