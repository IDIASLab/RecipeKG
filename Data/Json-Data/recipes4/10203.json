However the banana flavor just didn't come through as much as I thought it would. Next time I'm going to add banana extract too. I liked that this was very easy to make and moist - it's definitely a cake and not a quick bread! I added vanilla and cinnamon to the batter although I would leave out nuts next time. This is a pretty versatile recipe - add coconut or rum increase banana flavor add strawberies or chocolate chips. They would all probably produce interesting variations. For muffins pour 1/3 cup batter into lined muffin tins and bake 30 minutes (sea level) at 350F.",

I used a Ducan Hines butter yellow cake mix and made it to package directions all except for instead of using water for the mix I used milk but half the amount then added 3 mashed bananas and the pudding mix. The cupcakes were so moist they FELL IN in the middle. They didn't even need icing but I made homemade cream cheese icing anyway (8 oz cream cheese 1 stick softened butter 1 box powdered sugar 1 tsp vanilla) and sprinkled them with chopped pecans. I sent the leftovers to daycare with Jacob and the kids devoured them! These will DEFINITELY be at his birthday party coming up.",
