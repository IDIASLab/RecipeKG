I used organic eggs, kept the cheese at a half cup and the cheese I used was 2% sharp cheddar (to cut some of the fat) and I used turkey bacon and thinly sliced turkey ham. I used red bell pepper instead of green (just a personal family preferance) and omitted the jalapeno only because I'm feeding small children. I served this on toasted Dave's Killer Bread and instead of mayo, my husband used homemade salsa and reduced fat sour cream as \"glue\" to hold his om-wich together. I assume they liked them because five minutes later, nothing was left. Thumbs up!",

I made in microwave by melting 1 Tablespoon of butter in a 9\" pie plate. I separted the eggs and beat the egg whites until soft peaks formed then folded in the yolks and poured into pie plate. I cooked in the microwave for about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes. Puffed up beautifully I then added ingredients on one side of omelet and then folded over. Served with homemade salsa and sour cream. Also sprinkled garlic salt on buttered toast. This is basically the same recipe I use for making filled French omelets. I also use an apple filling or potato/ham filling.

I did stay close to the true recipe with only the omittion of chives & ham (didn't have any on hand). I used a red bell pepper as I finished my green one at dinner last night. Next time I will add more jalapeno as I could not taste any heat...and I only used 2 eggs and scaled the rest down by a third as I was the only one eating this and I served it on a toasted sprouted grain bagel instead of bread. I only put half the Omwich on the bagel the other half will be for breakie tomorrow!:) Great idea demz....thanks for the recipe....",
