It's better than turning on the oven, especially this time of year, and it cooked nicely without having to watch it and worry about it bubbling over. The key is convenience and my husband, who is Italian, loved it also. Thank you!",

I used more sauce then the recipe called for and took the lid off my slow cooker for about 20 minutes while the bread was cooking in the oven so it would thicken up fully. It turned out better than when I make in the oven. Will make in slow cooker again- thanks for the idea!!!",
