Well it turns out prime rib is easy but it is essential that you have a good thermometer. You probably spent $30+ on the meat. Save your investment and spend another $25 on a good thermometer with a probe and an alarm if you don't have one already. By following the rule about the temperature, you can scale this recipe. Cut the bones off the bottom of the roast and serve separately or save for another time. Slice the roast and serve with creamy horseradish, if desired.",

The only thing I did differently is insert the meat thermometer prior to placing the roast in the 450 degree oven.  I cooked the meat to 135 - pulled it and let it rest.  It was perfect for us.  Just done enough for hubby and rare enough for me.  If you cook to 145 and let rest your meat will be closer to well done rather than medium.  There are other cooking methods I prefer but the seasoning on this rib roast deserves 5 stars.",

The reviewers that talk about the rub being great and then using their own cooking instructions are probably right on but if you're new to prime rib, give this a try.  The husband of a friend of mine likes this rub so much that he uses it in his restaurant and says its the most popular item on his menu.  So please, cook it how you want (the turn the oven off method works very well but I think a low temp is good too) but the spice rub is probably the best feature of this recipe.",

After I applied the rub, I wrapped the roast in plastic wrap and let it come to room temperature while marinating (took about an hour and half). We could taste the mild flavoring of the rub in each bite. I did follow the cooking instructions, but took my roast out when it reached 130\u00b0 on my digital probe thermometer. The temperature rose to 142\u00b0 while wrapped in the foil for 15 minutes, so if you really like it rare, you might keep that in mind. That said, this was my very first Prime rib roast and my husband said it was excellent, better than he gets in a restaurant. Tender, juicy and really was very easy.",

I used a roasted garlic and EVOO paste instead of separate ingredients.  20 min at 450F and 90 min at 325F yielded a more medium than med-rare roast :( .  I also added chunked carrots and potatoes around the roast at about 15 min into the 325F time.  That was a mistake.  I should have tossed the veggies in oil, instead of just salt and pepper.  The meat was delicious, but I could have used better info on the timing.",

I patted my roast dry, then rubbed the 4 lb roast with 2 teaspoons of EVOO, mixed the Montreal seasoning, mustard powder and Italian seasonings, then heavily dusted the roast. I let the seasoned meat rest uncovered in the refrigerator for 3 hrs (next time I'll do 8 or even overnight), then followed the cooking instructions.  A thermometer is a must!  I inserted it prior to cooking and when the temperature reached 135, I pulled the roast and let it rest for about 25 minutes covered.  What a nice crust this cooking method and spice blend results in!!  We definitely will have again.",
