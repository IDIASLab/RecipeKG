But either way, it is delicious. NOTE: The best way I've found to pre-cook the chicken is to place each breast in the center of a square piece of aluminum foil and sprinkle on both sides with salt (and pepper, if desired).  Fold up the sides of the foil to form a sealed packet.  Place the packets on a baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour.  The chicken will come out moist and delicious.  Simply cube the chicken and it is ready to add to your recipes  (chicken salad, chicken ala king, etc).",

                "reviewBody": "Many of the reviews seemed to take issue with the ingredient amounts so I used my cook's intuition and eye-balled everything.  I omitted the pepperocinis (better served on the side like Papa Johns), approx. doubled the chicken, kept the rest of the measurements approx. the same, and made TWO medium pizza crusts with the ingredients instead of just one.  The key to keeping the chicken moist and flavorful is mixing a few TBSP of BBQ sauce into the cubed chicken before topping the pizza.  Otherwise, the edges tend to dry out while cooking.  Also, slice the onions super thin so they will cook more quickly.  If you have the time, I would definitely recommend making Jay's signature pizza crust over using a store-bought kind -- it turned out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Homemade crust is surprisingly easy to make, tastes fresher, and saves a lot of money. This pizza tastes great (very close to CPK) but I gave 4 stars because of the modifications.  This recipe will probably taste great with some pineapples too (similar to Davd & Buster's BBQ hawaiian pizza that seems to have disappeared off the menu).",

I love them but not on my pizza I don't think that would taste right. I also used 3 chicken breasts instead of 2. And whoever suggested making pizza dough out of bisquick is wrong. Bisquick doesn't make pizza dough. Thanks for turning a perfectly good pizza into chicken and barbeque sauce on a biscuit. I did it to try and save money like they did and it was not very good. First of all 1 1/2 cups of bisquick only made about enough \"dough\" to cover half on my pan. Next time I'll try using a real recipe for pizza dough. Other than that the pizza was great.",

I do think some of the measurements were off on the recipe and just eyeballed the amounts that I wanted on each one. Definitely use the pepperconi and red onion it helps round out all the flavor of the pizza otherwise you have come BBQ chicken on a crust. Also used regular BBQ sauce but dashed on some Tabasco. Used a combination of mozzerella and mild chedder cheese. It looked so good even before I put it in the oven. Plan on making this again tomorrow night for friends. This recipe is terrific and I wouldn't say that if it truly weren't. Easy preparation also. I eat CPK BBQ pizza all the time and this is pretty much on it if not better.",

The amount of ingredients stated for this made it taste like a pile of hot garbage. I've made BBQ chicken pizza before and it is much easier to gauge how much you put in it by eye. Good ingredients. Awful amounts. Also I recommend buying dough from a pizza shop. I make (great) homemade pizza frequently and this is by far the worst one I've had. Gauge the ingredients by eye.",
