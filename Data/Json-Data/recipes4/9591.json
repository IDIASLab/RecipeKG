                "reviewBody": "I love steak and kidney pie even more so with puff pastry which is delicious moistened by the gravy. But I think the author made an error or two. There is no need to use beef tenderloin in a stew preparation - you'll get a much better flavor from chuck or even leg of beef and even those cuts would not need to cook for three hours - maybe an hour and a half at most. And at the top of the recipe the cooking time is given as 1 hr 30 mins not the 3 hrs 20 mins the instructions say. In addition I usually soak the kidney in milk for several hours before cooking (this gets out some of the urine taste and smell but doesn't destroy the unique flavor). It's a good idea to use a pie bird or funnel to hold the pastry off the gravy so it will be nice and crisp when baked - the inside will still be moist. I'm rating the pie five stars because if you carry out these suggestions it will be very good indeed and I don't want to put anyone off making a splendid steak and kidney pie!",
