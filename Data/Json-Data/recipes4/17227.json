A few suggestions - I have a non-stick waffle iron and next time I will omit the cooking spray.  Also, be sure to flatten the dough a bit. Finally, I couldn't find the corn syrup in my cabinet so I omitted it, added a bit of hot water and mixed well then heated for 20 secs in micro.  Served with sides of bacon and breakfast sausage.

I flattened them out and they rose to perfection! watch the third batch the more you make the hotter the waffle maker gets. now I know what I'm gonna do the next time I want a fast cinnamon roll! my son loved them so much he woke me up early the next morning asking for more unfortunately I bought the last two pkgs. hopefully they restock soon! I just thinned the frosting with milk so it was a glaze. so good! Served with cheesy scrambled eggs fried potatoes breakfast sausage and fruit. awesome breakfast for dinner! my three sons' favorite dinner",

I will try them again with the waffle iron set to a lower temp than I normally use for waffles. I have a Waring Double Belgian Waffle Iron and I normally use 3 or 4 for waffles. I will try 2 or 3. I hope that this will lead to a better result. They were to dry and the tops where the layer of cinnamon was according to my six year old \"A little to crispy.\" He helped make them and neither of us \"burn food\" so they were crispy not burnt he explained. Also they didn't go far enough with a single recipe to feed my family of 5 to the same level of fullness that they say normal cinnamon rolls would have left them feeling. Again I will try again with using the \"grand\"er size rolls instead of the normal rolls. I will update review then.",
