I made one batch exactly as described (had decaf hazelnut beans on hand) and my husband loved it but I thought the texture of whole beans were a little overwhelming when eating. The second batch I coursely ground the beans and added about a teaspoon of decaf instant coffee to make the chocolate itself have a coffee flavor too. Incidentally I forgot the butter in the second batch and it didn't seem to matter. Melted the white chocolate separately and swirled it in the top as others have mentioned (using a toothpick for marbled effect) and with these changes would give it 5 stars. Another fancy touch is to score the chocolate when it is almost cooled (about 5-10 minutes in the fridge) then you can break it into beautifully even squares (1\" is plenty at a time!) A unique treat that is surprisingly easy to throw together. People either LOVE LOVE it or can't make it through one bite... count me in the first category. Fabulous next to a powerful red wine or a strong cup of after-dinner coffee. POW!",

The final result was a bit messy looking thin and as expected gritty. The second time I left the beans whole and drizzled white chocolate on top after the bark had completely set. The final result was thick and beautiful! For both trials I scored the bark after 2-3 minutes in the freezer which made slicing once completely set very easy. This recipe yielded 24 nice-sized pieces. I bake part-time and I break down all my recipes to cost of ingredients - this recipe using Starbucks whole coffee beans and Ghiardelli chocolate cost 5.09/batch. All in all this is a fast easy cheap and impressive treat that I'll be making again an again for friends and family.",
