I also added about 10 pieces of cooked, crumbled bacon to it, as well as about a cup of chopped broccoli. And oh yeah-- I made this in the slow cooker. I cooked the potatoes, water, broth, onions and celery on \"Low\" for about 6 hours. (When the potatoes were tender.) I then stirred it up a bit with a fork to break the potatoes up and make a thicker soup. Then I added the cheese, and once it was melted, I added the milk/flour mixture, the bacon and the broccoli. I kept it heated until it thickened, and it was perfect for a cool day. Thank you!\n\nNote: If you decide to go the slow cooker route, it is important that you don't add the milk or cheese until the end. Otherwise, everything seperates and looks kind of gross. I also chose to wait to add the broccoli because it can easily overcook in the time it takes potatoes to cook.",

I'm glad I read the reviews before making, as I did make a few changes:  I used a whole stick of salted butter, also added ground black pepper, garlic salt, and dried parsley and used sharp cheddar cheese vs. American.  Got out my trusty potato masher and mashed up the potatoes before I added the cheese.  Also took the advice of other readers and used 2 cups of water and 2 cups of chicken broth.  For garnishes I put out garlic and cheese croutons and Durkee french fried onions and served with a loaf of garlic toast.  Very, very good!  Would definitely make again!  Thank you!",

The next time I did do Velveeta instead of sandwich cheese. Mainly because I did not have that much sandwich cheese on hand. My husband asked to cut down on the celery a little bit. I did try the chicken stock the second time or should I say a chicken bullion. My family loved this recipe. If your substituting stock for water or a bullion cube to make the chicken stock do not add salt. I forget this allot of times that it will make anything way to salty. I wish people would give the recipe the chance first.... and leave out what they family wont eat. You will make it again if nothing else use it as a good base soup and add then. The first time I made this it was really good. So don't defeat the recipe before you try it like its written. I can see someone using different cheese at first just because the amount of singles but nothing else at first.",

I used eight potatoes (large baking potatoes) but that was WAY too much potato. I couldn't even fit all the potato into the pot. It was impossible to stir the potatoes and some burned to the bottom. Maybe I should have used small yellow potatoes? The recipe doesn't really specify. Also I don't eat American \"cheese \" so I attempted to substitute with sharp cheddar--but since real cheese doesn't come in prepackaged slices I didn't know exactly how much real cheese to add. The end result was a thick paste somewhere between soup and mashed potatoes. It was not particularly cheesy or flavorful--just tasted like potato. I'll keep looking for a more precise cheesy soup recipe.",
