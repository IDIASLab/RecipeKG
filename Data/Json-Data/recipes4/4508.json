I made this exactly as instructed and in the end the garlic and ginger turned very bitter and soured the carrots. If I had to redo this I would suggest slow cooking the carrots in the orange just concentrate with the honey but not adding anything else including the soy till the end. Season to taste at the point of the carrots being cooked but not before. This is the first time I have criticized a recipe on this site so please don't think I am being overly critical and do indeed appreciate recipes from all here. But this one seriously needs adjustment.",
