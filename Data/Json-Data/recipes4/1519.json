Due to some time constraints I made this over a two day period. The first day I cooked it for 4 hours and finished it off the next day. I found that after the full amount of cooking time I needed to add another can of chicken broth. I also made a roux with 3 T. of butter and 3 T. of flour tempered it with some hot soup and added it to the pot. This gave the broth a little body without making the soup overly thick. We enjoyed this and although the flavor was good next time I might add some taco seasoning to boost the flavor a bit more.",
