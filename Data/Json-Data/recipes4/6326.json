It tasted fine but I'm not use to sweet and oyster in same sentence! So may forgo next time. Adding the celery soup wae was a marvelous idea. AND guess what It does taste better the next day! I made it one night and we ate it because it smelled so good. I saved leftover- it actually did taste better the next day and I liked the consistency better. Thank's Paul for sharing your family receipe.",
