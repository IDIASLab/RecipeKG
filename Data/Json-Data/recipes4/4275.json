To me, it lacked 'oomph.'\" Watching my husband and daughter gleefully devour their bowls made me nudge my rating up a star. This is definitely one of those soups that can clear out the remaining bags of frozen veggies, which is the way I went as I'm not a fan of the texture of canned green beans, peas, or corn. I followed the recipe exactly, (w/ the exception of the frozen veggies) and I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed. The end result, while tasty, wasn't mind-blowing, although when I went to simmer it on day 2, I added 1/2 c. ditalini pasta, which helped sponge up a bunch of the liquid. It's just a soup that can't decide if it wants to be chili, or a stew, so if I made it again, I would either sub stew meat for the ground beef (going the stew route), or decrease the liquids and sub kidney beans for the green beans & peas (going the chili route.) But regardless of which direction I took this recipe, I would most definitely bump up the seasonings; more garlic, pepper, thyme.",

I only had a 32 oz carton of beef broth so I skipped the potatoes since I thought they might soak up too much liquid. I followed the advice of the reviewers and used a half bag of frozen veggies. The only reason I took away a star was because I added some Italian seasoning and am glad I did. It made it perfect for us. I liked that the broth was more beefy than tomatoey.
