If I had used 12, it would have been solid cheese!  Ugh!  I was a little concerned about no liquid, but it turned out just fine!  I added a few extra ingredients that I like in quiche, but basically followed this recipe to the letter--except for that cheese!  It was darned good.  Also, it was over-done and almost burned after 20 minutes!  Next time, I will lower the heat and watch it closer.  But I will make it again.  Thank you.",
