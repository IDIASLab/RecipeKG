By reducing the ratio of water to rice from 2:1 to 1.5:1 and reducing the cooking time from 20 minutes to 15 minutes, as well as rinsing the starch off the rice and toasting it, I've found a consistency I really enjoy. Don't be surprised if the bottom burns a little; I like to scrape up the crunchy bits at the bottom into the rice for some texture, but this is optional.",
