I added 1 T. poppy seeds and I used 1 tsp of almond extract in place of the butter extract and baked them in small coffee cans for Christmas gifts. If you use coffee cans they need to be clean and then greased with shortening and flour. Only fill them 1/2 full and bake for about 45 min. It makes 3 small coffee cans per recipe....also cool completely in coffee cans before removing. Wrap in saran wrap and then colored tissue paper gather at the top and then use curling ribbon to tie off. Very nice gift for any occasion.",
