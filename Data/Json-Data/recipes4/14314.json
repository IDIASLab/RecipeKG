The bacon grease adds fat to the cupcakes but not flavor so next time I would use canola oil to be a bit healthier. The icing recipe does need to be halved and instead of heavy cream you can just use whatever type of milk you have on hand. I love the peanut/bacon combo and the saltiness is a nice way to counter the richness of the peanut butter. However I think the texture is weird - a cupcake that has crunchy bits of peanuts and bacon in it. For next time I would try to figure out a way to make a cookie out of this flavor combination rather than a cupcake.",
