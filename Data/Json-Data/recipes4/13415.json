My husband oldest daughter and oldest son didn't mind it (but also \"wouldn't write home about it\") whereas my younger sons really had trouble getting it down. We figured that if you like Asian cooking you might really enjoy it because it definitely has a bit of that flair. We did make a few MINOR changes (shouldn't have affected the taste but in all fairness you never know)- rice milk (instead of almond milk) Bragg's Aminos (instead of soy sauce but has the flavor of mild soy sauce) and Kuzu Root Starch (instead of cornstarch but does the same thing). Try it for yourself though - you may like it! I just probably wouldn't experiment on the kids 'til you knew if it fit in with their palates!",
