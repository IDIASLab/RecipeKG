I layer it in a 9x13 glass pyrex pan instead of making individual triangles. It cuts PERFECTLY into squares that are easily servable without falling apart. I brush the pan with melted butter, layer 3 sheets of phyllo with a little melted butter on each layer and spread half of the spinach filling. I place 3 more sheets of phyllo and butter, then the rest of the spinach mixture and another 3 sheets of phyllo on top. Use a knife to cut a few slits to allow steam to escape. This is SOOO much quicker than individual traingles if you dont have the time!",

I did add a little garlic and a bit of fresh lemon juice to  the mixture. I am giving this only 4 stars, not for the taste but for the directions. If one hasn't worked with phyllo, they would need more specific directions. Be sure to keep it covered with a damp cloth and only expose the sheets you are currently working with to the air. Otherwise they dry out and are impossible to fold, cracking and splitting. There are plenty of tips on the box and don't forget to allow for defrosting time!  I also feel that the baking time is off. The trianles that I baked fresh were done in about 20\", nice golden brown with bubbly filling. I also froze some and those took closer to 45\" to be done.  I doubled the recipe and took a platter to a baby shower and everyone enjoyed them.",

I used 1/3 of a cup of olive oil instead of veggie oil, only one onion (saut\u00e9ed with 1 tsp of minced garlic), three eggs, added 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese, 1/4 tsp pepper (the feta is already somewhat salty), one package of Fillo brand phyllo dough (8 oz; it's already the appropriate size for a 9 x 13 pan), and about 1/4 cup of butter. I went for the layered spanakopita, with 10 sheets on phyllo on the top and bottom of the spanakopita and the spinach mixture sandwiched between (this is done by putting two sheets at a time in a buttered pan, brushing the top with butter, and adding two more sheets until you get 10 stacked sheets).
