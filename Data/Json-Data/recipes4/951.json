It being such a basic recipe means that you can make it as directed or add on to the ingredients to get even more satisfying results. My changes were mostly in the meat, which I doctored up like so: besides the onion, I added a generous amount of garlic (I'm a garlic freak), a can of mild green chile peppers, and half a pack of basic taco seasoning. Yum Yum. After that bit it is as easy as pie. You just roll everything up and bake and you've got dinner! This is also a wonderful meal to eat while on a budget. The last two times I've made this for my family, I served it with cornbread, Spanish rice, and extra enchilada sauce.",
