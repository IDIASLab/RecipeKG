Instead of sprinkling the cheese on top I just added it with the rest of the cheese in the casserole ingredients and brushed the tops of the biscuits with melted garlic butter.

Spot-on reviews b4 me knew this would be better w/ saut\u00e9ing the onion w/ garlic in a little butter first as well as how a chicken/biscuit combo just sings out for a pea and carrot partner so I did just those 2 things. I ended up mixing about 3/4 c. cheese into the casserole mixture rather than sprinkling any on top of the raw biscuits. These came out pretty tasty and not time-consuming to put together if you have either a rotisserie chicken to yank apart or some leftover shredded chicken already on hand. I'd make again for sure.",
