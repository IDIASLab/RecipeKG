Here's what I did: I omitted the pork, added shiitake mushrooms, used 6 cups water and 7 tbsp white miso instead of chicken broth, used 2 eggs and 1 tsp toasted sesame oil, omitted the salt, and added wakame (a leafy seaweed) and bean sprouts. Next time, I'll add a few more green onions. Prepared this way, it's a flavorful soup that's full of nutrients and not too heavy. Thanks for the inspiration!",

I use vegetable instead of chicken. In the end to give the soup a little more consistency I add a bundle of clear bean thread noodles at the end (after they have been soaked in water).
