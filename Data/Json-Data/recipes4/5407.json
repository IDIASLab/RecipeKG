I think this would be just as good with chopped cucumbers and crumbled feta cheese, too. We had this with leftover barbeque pork short ribs--it went very well together.

It also needed maybe salt maybe some other spices. Someone mentioned it would be good with sesame - which made me think replacing some of the olive oil with sesame oil would be tasty... I doubt I'll make this again - because if I do I'll end up doctoring it up and making it into my regular pasta salad.",

I used a very good quality balsamic which enhanced the flavor of the other ingredients instead of covering it. I do think the quality of the balsamic you use will affect the outcome significantly - the better the balsamic the better the flavor. We prefer Kalamata olives to black so I made that substitution and I think that was a very good choice given the other ingredients. I will make this again and with the change in olives next time will also add in a little red onion and a little cucumber and perhaps feta to give it more of a Mediterranean feel. The concept of this recipe is a good one.",
