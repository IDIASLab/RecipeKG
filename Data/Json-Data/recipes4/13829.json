If I make it again I will cut down on the both the 1 T. of salt in the water the raw fish soaks in before cooking and cut down on the 1 t. of salt in the \"breading\". And I love salty food so if I think it's too salty those of you that don't prefer salty foods should really watch the amounts. Halibut is at least twice the price of other similar white fish such as tilapia cod etc. I paid 16 for 10 oz. of Halibut while the other similar white fishes ran from 6 to 8 for the same amount. Halibut is extremely flaky so it fell apart right in the pan when I turned the filets - which was fine. The end result was about 10 pieces of fallen apart fish. It was very easy and quick to make - couldn't be simpler. But the finished product for me was good not great.",
