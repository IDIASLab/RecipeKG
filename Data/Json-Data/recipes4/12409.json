I RARELY use Tomato Paste so I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead. I liked it well enough (even thought it was \"GOOD\") but when -- just last night -- my Husband asked me \"when are you going to make that 'Eggplant thing' again?\" I just KNEW I had to come in here to rate this a 5! Who could have known?! Serve over rice.",
