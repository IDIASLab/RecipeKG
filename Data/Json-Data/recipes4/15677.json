The only thing I did differently was omit the water, as it just didn't need it.  You get a nice little crunch from the water chestnuts and just a hint of the soy sauce.  I dressed the buns with Garlic Aioli from this site, and it was the perfect choice.  I did use a meat thermometer, so they were  perfectly cooked and plenty juicy.  Next time, I'll mix up a double batch and just freeze the patties.  This burger ranks right up there with the best I've had in a long time and will be made often.",

Whole wheat bun went well with it. I sauteed mushrooms and put those on top (delish). Lots of flavor in these burgers so it was nice to add a new recipe to my ground turkey recipes (I eat a lot of ground turkey).",

It's usually so fat free that it gets dry before it's even completely done. Not this recipe...it was juicy and delicious!
