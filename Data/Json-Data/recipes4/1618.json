If you're at all like me, lucky enough to adore these gems, the health benefit is a bonus. After confessing all of this, I did in fact come home with a basket of the red beauties. Now.. this isn't the first stuffed tomato recipe I've tried, AR and other sites included. Same old, same old; A big fat disappointment. Not to give up though, this recipe had promise. No rice or breadcrumb fillers. Instead, spinach, crumbly bacon, onion cooked in a little bacon fat. (Please, if possible use real bacon so you can stick to the recipe and get the most out of it.) A little sour cream to keep everything together and some Monterey Jack on top. There it is! I did the - take the first bite - pause- OMG?  I can see where the tomatoes could be watery. I used a paper towel to blot out the insides. Because salt will draw out the juice, don't salt the insides of the tomatoes till just before filling. This seemed to help but even the juice was delicious. I was quite happy spooning it off the plate. (Well, I really wanted to lick it off!) The filling was enough for the 4 of them. The author gives a great tip suggesting Romas for more servings. Thanks so much.",

I used a melon baller to scoop out the insides of the tomatoes which worked really well. I left probably a little less than a 1/4\" shell. I made the stuffing as directed but added most of the cheese to it and just reserved a little to sprinkle on top. I barely had enough stuffing to fill the tomatoes so I would increase the amount of spinach next time. I also reserved some bacon for garnish. I found the baking time to be too much and one of my tomatoes totally split apart when serving. I would make these again because they did have really nice flavor but I would leave a thicker shell of tomato increase the spinach and reduce the temperature and baking time. This was a fun recipe to try.",

I gave up trying to get fresh spinach for it it all looked yucky. So I drained frozen really well and used about 1/2 a normal size box. I cut the recipe in half also. Used two medium size firm tomatoes. I cut the tops off the tomato and salted the insides after gutting and put upside down on a rack to drain while I made the stuffing mix. I didn't add any extra salt. I never had a stuffed tomato so I wasn't sure I would like this but it was fantastic! A little watery but that is from the frozen spinach I'm sure. Next time I'm using fresh. Really good thanks ChefsyndiG! Hey we live in the same town!",

Everyone enjoyed the freshness of the tomatoes and commented on being able to taste each ingredient. All of the flavors went together well. I used fresh baby spinach and experienced a little bit of the watery consistancy that \"sassyoldlady\" mentioned when cutting them open. We usually cut back on the amount of hot sauce called for in a recipe but everyone thought that in this one we actually should have added a tad more. Neither of these little complaints will stop me from making these again before the end of tomato season this summer. Thanks for sharing!",

I used Roma tomatoes fresh from my friend's garden cut in half and cleaned out for this recipe. I skipped the salting and draining step because I didn't care if they were juicy. They turned out perfect! I used a 10-ounce package of frozen spinach because it's what I had on hand. I had to add a little extra sour cream because of the extra spinach and I also used 6 slices of bacon instead of 3. I forgot the hot pepper sauce and my parents didn't have any so I added some salt and pepper to the filling so it wouldn't be bland. We gobbled these down so quickly I didn't have time to take a picture! Thanks ChefsyndiG!",

I also blanched red onions rather than saute then I used a Parma ham and a mascarponi to bind oregano leaves and finished with a Grana Padano cheese. Yummy as a starter with Veal second and wined with a full bodied Valpolicello.",
