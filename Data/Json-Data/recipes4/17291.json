After much experimentation, this simple recipe is still the best. These beans are a great base. Add hot sauce and sauteed vegetables for a delicious soup. Add to your favorite burrito or serve any way you like; a meal itself or a perfect side dish. Don't be shy with salt, good beans are salty. Use whatever beans you like. My favorite beans for this recipe are black, pinto, and canary beans. Recipe is for 6 quart pressure cooker, so adjust if yours is smaller.",

I ate these as is with some Tabasco and then we added jalape\u00f1os mashing them for vegetarian tacos. They were a welcome addition in soup for lunch the next day. I didn't add any salt regardless of the description and no one missed it. We also chose to use only 2 cloves of garlic and the beans were fine this way. I used a 7 litre cooker and used enough water to cover the soaked beans by 2 inches. I cooked for 10 minutes allowing the steam to release naturally. The beans were a little soft breaking easily when touched with a fork so watch your cooking time.",
