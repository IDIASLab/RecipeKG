I had a couple pieces of chicken left over so I boiled them then pulled meat apart into small bite size pieces. I changed the recipe a little. I used 1 family size can of cream of chicken and 1 family size can of cream of mushroom. I substituted the 2 cups of water for 1 can of chicken broth. I also added a half cup of milk a half cup of frozen copped onions 1 small bag of frozen peas & carrots and a 8 ounce container of sour cream as suggested in other reviews to take the can taste away. We poured it over toast and bisquits DELICIOUS. I will be adding this to my recipe book. Thanks for sharing.",

I added 8oz sour cream to lighten the canned-taste and used chicken broth instead of water. Toward the end I added 1 tbsp corn starch to 1 tbsp cold water stirred in and let it boil for 2 mins to thicken it up a bit. Due to son's dietary restrictions I used diced zucchini and fresh sauteed mushrooms instead of peas. Served over large grands biscuits and the fam went back for seconds. Will probably make again.",
