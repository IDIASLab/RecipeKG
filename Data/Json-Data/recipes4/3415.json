These are best prepared and served that day.  They don\u2019t need to be refrigerated to set and they actually have more flavor at room temp.  I use a food processor to chop the peanuts but have also put them in a Ziploc bag and let my boys whack them with a rolling pin before when we needed the diversion.  Hope you enjoy them as much as we do!",

The thing I didn't like though was that the frosting seems to melt off the strawberrys after an hour of doing them.
