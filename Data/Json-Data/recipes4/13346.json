I made a few changes and it was excellent: cornstarch instead of flour/butter roux cayenne powder instead of red pepper flakes Italian-seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain fat-free evaporated milk and fat-free sour cream and sprayed the top of the casserole with non-stick cooking spray instead of dotting with butter. After it baked for 30 minutes I switched to broil on Low for a couple minutes to brown the topping and make it crispy. I will be making this again for Christmas eve but with 8 servings this time for the family. THANK YOU AGAIN!",

You can't taste the sweet potatoes or chickpeas. It's just mac and cheese with the nutrients you get from the chickpeas and sweet potatoes! I must say though, that the prep time took me much longer than 25 minutes because I had to make the mashed sweet potatoes prior to everything else. Also, I ran into a scalding issue with the evap. milk and roux. That wasn't really a problem in the recipe. More a problem with the clean up. The entire recipe from beginning-end took me about 2.5 hours, and I'd consider myself an intermediate cook. This recipe also made a ton of leftovers! We didn't have a 9x13 pan, so I improvised and used 2 9inch pie pans. Worked just as well and my husband liked how I just cut our mac and cheese portions into pizza-shaped triangles. :) Yes, he's a 10 year old trapped in a 30 year old's body. But I love the man. Try this recipe! Also, I recommend adding more salt to the evaporated milk/roux mixture. The mac and cheese wasn't very salty, but the cheese really packs a punch!",

However for anyone dubious about them you cannot even taste them so DO NOT let that stop you from making this very yummy dish. I followed the directions exactly and used portion sizes of 1/16 which was PLENTY to eat. I can't imagine eating more for a single serving. I portioned it all out and am going to freeze my pieces to save as a Friday night treat instead of pizza. My husband however LOVED it and wants to eat his until it's all gone.: ) Thanks so much for sharing.",
