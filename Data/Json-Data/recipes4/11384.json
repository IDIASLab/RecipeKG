Then I vary the fruit each time I make it allowing about 1/2 c for each type until I reach the 3 cups total fruit called for by the recipe. I've used dates figs dried mango peaches nectarines apricots & cranberries golden raisins and unsweetened coconut in addition to regular raisins and dried cherries. For variety substitute coconut maple or banana flavoring for the vanilla or maple syrup or agave nectar for the honey. Line your baking pans with parchment paper for super easy clean up then roll the paper up and store it to use for your next batch. You can cut the fat by subbing applesauce for 1/2 of the oil. I've done this several times and it works fine. Note: if you're looking for a clumpy granola this is not the one for you. This only clumps up some IF your honey is beginning to solidify. If clumps are your thing choose a recipe with more sugar.",
