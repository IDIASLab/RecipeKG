Good way to use up leftover rice and I will make this again!",

Right after completing the recipe I tasted the dish and thought \"meh\". Served 3 hours later with dinner and it was \"wow\"! One small change - I left out some of the olive oil to cut back on fat and calories. I drizzled over the top and mixed in - probably 1/8 to 1/4 cup. Everything else was followed to the letter. Great healthy alternative to potato or macaroni salads in the summer time.",
