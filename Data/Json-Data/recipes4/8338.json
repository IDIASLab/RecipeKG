Zoodles weren't mushy and the bechamel with tomatoes really makes this zoodle lasagna recipe in our opinion! Cook time was spot on! Used the Bechamel sauce recommended in the Editor's Note (for Gluten Free sub with GF All Purpose Flour--I use Better Batter). Had a jar of crushed tomatoes from last year's garden surplus--just cooked them down more and used the same amount as called for (tomato sauce) in the recipe. Hubs accidentally added way too much of the Bechamel sauce (I made double on purpose to use the remainder the next day) and it did come out soupy but that's our fault! Still loved the flavors though! Pay attention to the recipe and the editor's note and this will be divine!! Next time I may add an extra layer of lightly sauteed (just undercooked) vegetables (e.g. mushrooms spinach bell pepper etc.)! Thank you for another awesome recipe!",

In subsequent preparations I baked the Zoodles (on a wire rack in a sheet pan) for 5 mins at 375 prior to casserole assembly. This additional step solved both problems! I also found that I prefer using the Vegetable Sheeting attachment on my KitchenAid stand mixer it makes the Zoodles more consistent with actual lasagna noodles.",

The bechamel recipe in the notes works perfectly well when you use gf flour or corn starch instead of wheat flour. Also, in order to reduce moisture, some people sprinkle salt on the zucchini and allow it to rest or pre-cook it. That is your choice, of course. We like the liquid from the zucchini and the nutrients it provides. I hope you enjoy it. Ciao, ciao.",
