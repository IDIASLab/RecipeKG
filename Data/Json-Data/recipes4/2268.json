I don't even want to know how many calories or fat grams are in this because it was just so darn cheesy buttery and just plain good. I mean we're talkin' delish with a capital \"D\" here. I used Hellman's light mayo and reduced fat cheese just so I wouldn't feel too bad about eating so much of this. My husband and I devoured this - can't wait to make it again! Not too soon though as I'd like to fit into my clothes... Thanks for a great recipe STEFANY21!",

Btw, someone rated this 2 stars because of the ingredients.  Why give a bad rating without trying the recipe just because of the calorie content?  That's insane.
