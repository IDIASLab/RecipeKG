Instead of processing my own garlic and ginger paste which can be time consuming and messy, I picked up some garlic paste and ginger paste at a local Indian grocer.  I used 1/4 teaspoon garlic paste and 1/8 teaspoon ginger paste (don't use too much ginger paste because the taste can be very overpowering!).  Also, instead of boiling the water for the cashews (cutting out some steps here!), I just crushed up the cashews in a paper towel and put it in after the liquids were poured in and just let it cook.  You can also substitute the cream with low fat coconut milk and it turned out GREAT!!!!!",

Also, several reviewers mentioned that it was a very mild dish. Well, Indian Chili powder is not the same as Mexican and is, in fact,very hot. It can be purchased at an Indian food store. The brand I use is Rajah. It makes a huge difference to the flavor, but use it sparingly.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a wonderful recipe! It tastes  just like what the restaurants serve. Here are my suggestions: First, I suggest that you season the chicken pieces to taste ( it really doesn\u2019t have to be breast ) with some salt, cilantro, cumin, garam masala and ginger and leave in the fridge for about 4-6 hours. This way the flavor goes right through the meat. Second, add 1.5 times the amount  of spices(except the bay leaf) the recipe calls for when you are ready to fry in the oil This really gives it a nice spicy taste. Thirdly, people complained that the sauce was watery. I don\u2019t understand why! The trick is to simmer the sauce to your liking. The longer you simmer, the thicker the sauce will become. Fourth, add  1 finely chopped jalapeno pepper (with about 1/4of the seeds) to the sauce to give it that extra kick. Finally  serve this rich sauce over saffron jasmine rice",

As it was we had to keep spitting out these little crunchy pieces. I used 2.5 tsp garam masala 1/4 tsp. cayenne 4 bay leaves and coconut milk rather than heavy cream (maybe that's why it wasn't as thick as it should be?).",

I've made it with raw chicken or for a quicker meal I shred roasted chicken from the store and I have even replaced the chicken with potatoes peas and diced carrots and use vegetable broth for the vegetarian nieces. Easy to modify the spices for your own tastes - we always throw in a little cayenne. I do not use the bay leaves nor process the garlic and ginger but instead brown them with the onion. Following another raters advice I do occasionally add raisins and they are a nice touch. To keep the dish light I use 1 cup of plain yogurt and skip the cream. We also typically serve it over brown rice.",

I didn't have any bay leaves or turmeric but I think it was fine without. I also didn't grind up the cashews just left them chopped. I used fat-free sour cream instead of yogurt and for the heavy cream I subbed 1/3 cup skim milk and a few tablspoons of margarine. This probably made it considerably more healthy and the dish was still very creamy. At the end of the cooktime I mixed brown basmati rice right into the chicken mixture and it was delicious. My husband ate the leftovers in tortillas the next day and said it tasted even better after having time to sit. I will make this again.",
