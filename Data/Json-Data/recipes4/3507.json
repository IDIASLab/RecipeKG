I then put the cooked leeks on the gouda and rolled it. Then rolled it in the ham. The filling came out fine. It wasn't a messy goopy mess this way.

I'm not sure what adjustments could be made to the chicken--I covered mine front and back with black pepper for some umph due to other reviewer comments. That wasn't enough anyway. Smoked gouda is also strong enough that I really lost any other flavors that might have been in the filling. Neither did my gouda 'melt' exactly. I think the pan wasn't hot enough since I was aiming not to burn the garlic. Unfortunately not something I'd do again.",

After the chicken was done (it did not take as long because I had thinned the breasts) and the chicken was resting I grated a bit of extra cheese on the top and garnished with more of the cooked leaks.
