Had to brown it in the Dutch oven which was close to impossible b/c it was so big.  But we did it.  I was afraid of using so much Worcestershire.  It just felt weird to dump so much in but I followed the recipe to the T.  Double of course.  OMGoodness!  It was amazing.  Falling apart when we tried to cut it or move it so we just lifted the rack and hoped it didn't fall apart completely.  Success.  It was ridiculous.  Thank goodness I used a ton of mushrooms and 2 large shallots b/c the mushroom mixture is soooo yummy.  Can't rave enough.  Will buy a smaller one next time.  Thank goodness I had a huge Dutch oven or we would have been in trouble.  The Au Jus is also amazing.  Saved a large portion and skimmed off the fat this AM and you don't need to do anything to it but drizzle over the meat and your homemade mashed potatoes (but of course) 10 thumbs up.  My new staple.  I have no doubt it will be a hit at a party.  The only change is - I used butter.  I don't know when I last bought margarine more than 20 years ago for sure. Thanks for the GREAT recipe!",

(got scared when i tasted this and found it to be really spicy! not to fear, though, the final product wasn't spicy at all) i added this liquid to the meat in the crockpot, topped it with the mushrooms and butter/margarine and set the meat on low and cooked for 10-11 hours. it was stunningly simple and so delicious that everyone took seconds and thirds.",
