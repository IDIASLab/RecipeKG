In so doing I swapped out a couple of ingredients for those I thought better suited - fresh tomatoes for the \"pasta sauce\" and white wine rather than red; both lighter alternatives. Given that I used the Creole seasoning I omitted the crushed red pepper flakes. I used no butter just olive oil; only enough to saute everything. I served this over Shirataki (read fake) angel hair pasta - a substitute that fools no one but makes you feel better about what you ate! This is a nice humble dish satisfying yet still light and fresh.",
