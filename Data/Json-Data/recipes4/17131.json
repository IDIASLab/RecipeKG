I was skeptical that the dough would make nice dumplings but it turned out so well!  My only caution is to use small pieces of dough, they grow as they bake.  Two teenagers asked for seconds (and thirds!)\n\nMade this yesterday and I wanted to add - for all the working/cooking moms and dads out there I tried this on low for 8.5 hours when I had to be in the office and it turned out really well.  I actually didn't notice a difference.  Just be aware you either need someone to put the dumplings in ( I trusted a teenager) or it will take another 1 - 1.5 hours after you get home!",

I did not have any poultry seasoning so I used Italian seasonings and sea salt and fresh cracked pepper. I did not soak the chicken first, I seasoned each breast and placed them in the bottom of the Crock-Pot. I then poured about half a box of great value chicken stock over the chicken. I chopped up one large onion and about 6 cloves of garlic very finely (we love garlic) and put it all into the pot on top of the chicken and broth. Next I put about half of a large bag of mixed frozen veggies into the Crock-Pot and cut up my butter into cubes and scattered it on top of the veggies. I then poured my soups directly over the veggies, I used one large can of cream of chicken soup and one small one. \n\nI cooked this on low for 7 hours then I took all of the chicken out and shredded it with two forks and returned it to the Crock-Pot. I used refrigerated biscuit dough as the recipe calls for and cut each biscuit into fourths. I rolled the pieces in flour and then dropped them into the top of my chicken stew mix. Leaving them at the very top, I placed the lid back on and turned the Crock-Pot to high and cooked for another hour. Dumplings were cooked perfectly and the chicken soup came out delicious and full of flavor!! Will definitely be making this many more times in the future!",

Being a novice I didn't realize that the biscuit dough bites should be placed on top not mixed in with the stew. Yikes what a gooey mess. Also I did add some frozen petite peas which I thought made it too sweet but that's just personal preference. Fantastic easy recipe",

Didn't have poultry seasoning or celery so I used 1/2 tsp rosemary and 1/2 tsp thyme and some sprinkles of celery seed. Next time make sure to use poultry seasoning- the rosemary taste was too strong. Also added a bag of frozen cut green beans and 1/2 bag of frozen corn (good addition). Because I started the stew too late in the crockpot I transferred it to a stock pot during the last hour. Used Bisquick for dumplings.",
