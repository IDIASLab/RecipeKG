I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great for the little taste I got! They scarfed (is this a word?) it down and only left me a few shreds to try since I was cooking tortillas for them. The little shreds I tried were awesome tho! Also didnt even get a pic next time I will. This must be a keeper if its gone that fast. I served it with re-fry beans mexican rice and tortillas.

The first night I made it I realized at the last minute I had no cummin. So I cooked it without which resulted in swiss steak (very good too) Now I am cooking it with the cumin a beer I added more garlic and colorful bell peppers and a little extra cummin. I had to make enough to feed my extended family too because they thought it looked so YUMMY! Kudos to wifeyluvs2cook! Even the Cuban at my work LOVED this and said it definetly needs the cummin to set off the sweetness! KEEPER!",
