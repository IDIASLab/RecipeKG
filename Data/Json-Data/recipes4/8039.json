I actually used eggnog with alcohol in it that I made and that added a nice touch too. The one thing I didn't really care for was the choice of the cut of chicken. I would have much preferred white meat. I didn't see the notes about cutting the thighs up into smaller pieces under after it was too late but that is something I recommend. This is definitely one I would make again when I have eggnog on hand.",
