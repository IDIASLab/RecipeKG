I made a few minor changes: instead of using tomato suace i used a jar of Ragu traditional spaghetti sauce. I didn't have basil on hand so i used 1/4 tsp. of oregano instead. I also used 1/4 lb of ground beef mixed in with the venison meat to cut the gamey taste. It was awesome! It went so fast too. Serve with garlic bread and it's a meal fit for a king!",
