Some tips to avoid okra getting slimy: 1)Sprinkle okra with vinegar and salt and let it stand for a couple of hours or even up to a day. Rince well before using. Or 2)place okra in a non-stick pan and cook it alone in high temperature for a few minutes (until it starts changing colour). Remove from hit and add it to the rest of the incredients.",

I won't make this recipe again. I can't think how to fix it without making it a calorie and salt nightmare. Update: This dish is REALLY bad as leftovers. The flavors do not develop well.
