Is it paleo?\" I don't follow any 'diet' other than to eat what makes my mouth smile and my stomach sing in moderation so I'll try anything that's considered free of this or that or intended for cave people or mole people. But in regards to this recipe's description if I'm not mistaken cheese isn't part of the paleo diet? No bother to me load on the cheese b/c this recipe really really really needed some zap & zing. Chicken needed s&p tomato sauce should be a marinara or at least have other seasoning added to it b/c the oregano on its own was very one-dimensional and over-powering. I didn't change anything about the recipe and we ate it w/ zucchini and penne pasta all of which needed a heavy sprinkle of salt pepper and parmesan to make up for the boring chicken. Points for ease though - the prep and directions were fine dandy and speedy.",
