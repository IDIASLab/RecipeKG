I made the \"filling\" part of the recipe to top a German Chocolate cake because I was wanting to use up Marshmallows. I heated the water in the saucepan 5 minutes before the cake was done setting my double boiler aside with ingredients inside until ready. I added some Creme Brulee Sauce (like a caramel topping) a small splash of vanilla and substitute the wine with Seven-up. Topped the cake (and ate it too) while still warm and YUM!!! It was a great hit for the neighborhood Women's bible study! Will be making this one again!",
