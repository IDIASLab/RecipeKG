I'm rating it 4 stars regardless, because it gave me a starting point to what is now one of my family's favorite dinners........... A few things I do is double (or more) the rice, add a can of cream of mushroom, a package of pea pods, 1/2 package of mix veggies, sliced water chestnuts, mushrooms, minced garlic, and celery seed instead of fresh. For the almonds I use Almond Accents (original). They're paper thin and pre-salted. These are a necessity in our opinion. We also serve our noodles on the side so they don't get mushy and everyone can add to their own personal taste. I use rice noodles. The ones that look just like chow mein noodles, but a tad thinner. We prefer these and they only cost a few cents more.",

My husband has always loved hamburger helper's Rice Oriental so I browned the hamburger with onion powder and garlic salt (my 3 year old recoils at anything with chunks of onion) then added the rice, water, almonds and soy sauce.  I am not a huge fan of condensed cream soups so I just made a quick gravy/sauce by combining about two tsp of corn starch and water.  The flavor was JUST like hamburger helper and the almonds were a wonderful touch.  Much, much healthier and cheaper.  I will definitely be making this again!!!",
