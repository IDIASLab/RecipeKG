If anything, this underpromises & overdelivers. (Three times, my normally-quiet husband said, \u201cMy God, this is good.\u201d)  Specifics:   (1) PREPARATION.  Easy! This is a restaurant-quality dish, which puzzled our dinner guests, who asked if my schedule had changed since it seemed I\u2019d been cooking all afternoon. (2) RELIABILITY.  Follow the instructions & there\u2019s no way to mess this up.  (I made a couple of mistakes\u2014the phone rang while I brought the milk to a boil; no problem\u2014just skim the overboil and add more milk. I also set my gas burner too high, allowing the milk to boil down too quickly; adding more milk was an instant fix.)  (3) FLEXIBILITY.  Don\u2019t hesitate if you have a smaller loin, or maybe a larger one (as in our case). Substitute garlic salt for regular, if you wish.  Etc.  (4) PLATING. Carving\u2018s a pleasure because the pork\u2019s just-right tender and manageable.  (5) SERVICE. There are a variety of options. Since the finished pork and gravy looked scrumptious, I decided to carve at the table, thus set the whole loin on an oblong serving dish, surrounding it with sliced tomatoes and mixed lettuce leaves. (6) BONUS. The gravy makes itself! * DO* COOK DOWN THE MILK TILL IT\u2019S THICK, CURDLED AND GOLDEN BROWN. THE SAVORY KERNELS WILL POP IN YOUR MOUTH.  ",

Fat is flavor.  If you cover this completely, it will overcook.  The lid should be about 3/4 on so it can vent over a nice simmer.  I think people are covering this or cooking over too high a heat, because this is one of the most foolproof ways to cook pork LOIN (not tenderloin).",

We do tend to be low-sodium kinda people, though, I guess the low sodium diet has finally succeeded in changing our tastebuds! This smells so divine and looks like you slaved for hours, when really, you just prepped it and left it for a few hours! Thanks for the recipe, Ken, I'm sure we'll have this again! (To those who wound up with dry meat -- you need to use a deep pot, so that the meat is swimming in as deep a milk mixture as you can get. I also turned my roast (using tongs!) halfway through to keep the top from getting too dry.)",

I had some pork medallions that were in my freezer needing to be used. I decided that if this recipe was intended for a roast then it would also be fine with what I had and right I was. Followed the recipe exactly only I did up the garlic to two cloves and used dried rosemary. I do think it's essential that a heavy bottomed dutch oven be used. It produces a nice even heat distribution for even cooking and no problem with recreating the sauce to look like it was intended. Great job Ken and thanks for thinking outside the \"box\" with this one.",
