THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME.....WITH OR WHITHOUT THE MEAT... do try...(i like to cook mine longer cuz i like a thicker soup...) but this could be vegetariain easy! Dave...excellent recipe!!!!",

I'm sure it changed the flavor, but it was still quite good (and I'll try the celery another time).  I also added some extra water, but I still ended up with a hearty, satisfying soup.",
