These were wonderful although I did make some changes based on the ingredients available. In addition to the flaked grilled salmon I used 1/8th cup of coleslaw made with caesar dressing (rather than rice) a sprinkle of finely grated parmesan cheese and some finely chopped fresh tomatoes and green onions from my garden. YUM! What a great lunch these wraps made! Thanks for the fantastic idea Kimberly.",
