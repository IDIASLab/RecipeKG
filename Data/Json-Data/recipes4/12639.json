Next time I think I will use red wine vinegar for a better flavor right off. Served it with german noodles and green peas.",

The first thing I do is marinate the beef roast for 5-6 days, and reserve and use some of the marinade to make gravy later.  This recipe\u2019s  beef does not have the flavor benefit from marinating, so this makes the gravy VERY important, and this is where this recipe disappoints.  Upfront I had reservations about this recipe, but I don\u2019t like changing it much the first time, so I prepared it as written.  The beef drippings that you get from roasting adds great flavor to the gravy, but this quick-cooked beef can\u2019t do that.  The beef was plenty tender, but the gravy tasted just like vinegar and water, and there\u2019s no way that you can thicken this into a gravy with the flour and water amounts listed in the recipe.  In order to salvage this meal, I first had to add a little sugar, added a bit more flour-water, but also added some crushed gingersnaps that I always keep on hand for sauerbraten.  This not only helps thicken the gravy but adds incredible, true sauerbraten flavor.  I\u2019m going to make this again because I like how quick and easy it is in the pressure cooker, but I\u2019ll use a good-quality beef broth instead of water, cider vinegar, and then as above, incorporate the gingersnap crumbs into the gravy.  Sorry for the less than favorable review, but IMO this recipe needs tweaking.",
