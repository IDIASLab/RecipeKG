I only used 1/2 pound and that was plenty of meat.  A full pound of meat would've been too much in my opinion.  Also, I would leave out the egg yolk.  I don't see how that adds anything to it.  It does need either a flavor packet added or some salt.  I have also made it using beef stew meat, instead of the chicken.  I substituted mushrooms for the peas and carrots and it was great.",
