I wanted to throw out there some suggestions to make it taste more authinic. #1.Use bacon grease instead of vegetable oil. #2. Add chopped garlic with your chopped onions and bell peppers. #3. Saute your onions, garlic, and bell pepper first before adding the rice. #4. Brown rice well. #5. Use chicken broth instead of water!!!! It gives it that much more flavoring. #6. Add in about a 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumino. This spice you will find in all true mexican food but it is very strong a little makes it wonderful....a lot is too overpowering and can ruining a dish. #6. Add some parsely to it. I love parsley and use it in every dish. The best rice to use for this meal is long grain. I will be serving it tonight with homemade Empanadas. I hope my additions helps.",

I used Chicken stock in place of water, and I added 1 large seeded and diced jalepeno to the green peppers.  This gave it the little added \"bite\" that I was used to in Spanish cuisine.  Five cheers for Dave on this fine recipe.  I will make it many more times, as my small family and many friends agreed with me on the outcome.  Thanks again, Dave.",

Brown rice, add back in the sauted veggies, and follow recipe as is.\r\n\r\nI would suggest reserving the rest of the chicken stock, and stir the rice every 10 minutes of simmering.  It can easily burn unattended.  Add more stock if needed.\r\n\r\nWhen rice is done(after about 25 minutes), fluff with fork and serve.  Color, taste, and texture should be restaurant quality. \r\n",
