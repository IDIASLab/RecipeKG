Plus it was quick and easy to put together for dinner - not to mention a bit healthier than fried chicken wings! I used \"No-Mayonnaise Ranch Dressing\" from this site to mix with the bleu cheese. For the sauce I used Frank's Red Hot butter and a mix of seasonings for our homemade hot wing sauce vs. salad seasoning mix. I used bagged salad mix and added some cherry tomatoes and croutons for a bit of crunch. Another awesome recipe Thanks Celeste!",

In the interest of making this a healthier alternative (it's a salad after all!) I seasoned three chicken breasts with salt & pepper then grilled them (I would broil or bake in the winter). I didn't use any oil or butter. Then I sliced/shredded it into bite sized pieces. I wasn't sure if 1/4 c. of Frank's RedHot would be enough to cover the three chicken breasts but it was the perfect amount - I mixed the Frank's RedHotand the McCormick's seasoning in a large bowl then added the cut-up cooked chicken and tossed it around. I had two large salad bowls (2 servings) layered with romaine chopped tomatoes celery and shredded parmesan. I divided the chicken mixture between the two bowls then my husband topped his with lite blue cheese dressing and I used lite ranch. We both really loved this and I'll be making it again and again and again and again......",
