It started getting expensive and very hard to find. Now they don't make it at all.  So back in the 70's I looked at the ingredients on the can and realized it was made with mutton.  I started getting lamb bones at the butcher and adding all the ingredients that were listed on the can.  The can did list rutabaga as one of the vegetables.  I have added potatoes as a substitute when I didn't have rutabaga on hand.  I LOVE barley so I do not use the quick cooking as it can have a much softer texture.  I usually add 1/2 cup more barley than what the recipe calls for.  I was given several pounds of turnips and while searching for turnip recipes I ran across this version of Scotch Broth.  Simply delicious.  Don't expect a beefy flavor, it is much different, but oh soooo good.  Step outside the box if you have not tried it.   I hope you love it as much as my family does.",

Added 8 cups of water and boiled followed by simmering for 2.5 hours. After pulling out large chunks of carrots turnip meat and bones I added 2/3 cup pre-soaked barley let the broth simmer for 30 minutes while I chopped the meat.
