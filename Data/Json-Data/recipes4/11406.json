This takes all the nasty strong flavor out, makes it fork tender and will be delicious any way you cook it.  I used to hate the taste of liver, but once I discovered this secret, I can now eat it just seasoned with a little garlic salt & pepper & quickly pan fried in oil oil & butter (and put into a sandwich).  Do this before any type of preparation and it will be DELISH!!  As a side note; I have even left it sitting in milk overnite because after I started to prepare it I got a last minute invite to go out, and it was still wonderful the next day!! I just put plastic over the bowl & popped into the fridge... It was So tender & Yummy!!",

I don't eat anything pork so pork liver is not in the race; but I do like beef and chicken liver and I like variety (it is after all the spice of life). I like this recipe; but as Patty Mae pointed out the pan should be covered while simmering the sauce and liver together. Also I used butter instead of vegetable oil for sauteing the onion. Olive oil is another good choice. I avoid vegetable oil because of the GMO factor; and butter or olive oil are much healthier not to mention much tastier alternatives to vegetable oil. Liver and other organ meats are consumed for their health benefits (Vitamin A Vitamin B6 Vitamin B12 Folate Riboflavin Niacin Iron Copper Omega-6 Phosphorus Selenium Manganese and Zinc in this case) so it makes sense to use a sauteing medium that is also healthy. Butter provides selenium iodine vitamin A and other nutrients that vegetable oil does not. Butter is also a good source of good cholesterol and glycospingolipids which help protect the stomach from gastrointestinal infections. Olive oil helps to put HDL and LDL cholesterol into a healthy balance as well as being anti-inflammatory. Coconut oil is another good oil to use because of its anti-fungual properties. I also use organic tomatoes. So substituting butter olive oil or coconut oil for the vegetable oil and using organic tomatoes make this already VERY healthy recipe even healthier and tastier.",

I did make a few changes due to using what I had on hand:  Used can of tomato soup and 1/4 cup water (misread the recipe).  I mince/freeze 2 onions to a quart bag, so I used a bag of minced onions. Didn't have oregano, but substituted Italian seasoning and added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.  I told my husband that we were having ITALIAN BEEF LIVER.
