I had one very long slim sweet potato which I grated into the bottom of a 6 x 10 glass dish (approx. size)  I used 6 eggs, handful of grated cheese, cup of spinach chopped, half of an onion diced fine, quarter cup of Bisquick, pepper, salt, 1/2 cup water...........my point is that this method and combination of vegetables is dependable.  Follow the \"how to\" instructions and use the combination amounts that you like best.  Don't fret, it's like making quiche. It was a lovely brown when it came out of the oven.  I strongly suspect that it will re-heat in the microwave and still be nice.  My 17 year old son put ketchup on it, but that is not a bad thing.  Thanks to the Cook for making a recipe that I can fit into my busy life. Add a tossed salad and this is lovely breakfast, lunch or super.",
