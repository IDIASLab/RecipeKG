I love serving this entree because it causes me NO stress and everyone raves over it. While the pork is roasting, make another batch of the cranberry glaze to serve in a gravy boat alongside the sliced pork roast.  For food safety, the new batch should not be prepared in same pan as the first if you have been basting directly out of the saucepan. If you basted out of another dish, you can use the same pan.",

Pork should be cooked to 140-145 degrees and then set aside to rest for 15 minutes; the internal temp will go up and the juices will seep throughout the meat. A foolproof rule of thumb to use is 15 minutes per pound @ 350 degrees. In my experience, cooking to an internal temp of 160 or above usually results in unpleasantly dry meat. For succulence, give my suggestion a try.",

All said it was yummy AND from my point of view the quickest roast I ever made (fully thawed) but it's not walk away time. I was busy making gravy & ladling every 10 min. Originally I only had 1/2C of apple jelly & used 1/2C of Mint Jelly w flecks of mint to make up for it. It was a DELIGHTFULLY HAPPY ACCIDENT & lent a subtle undertone of mint. Next time I will use solely mint to replace the apple jelly. I had at least 1 Cup of sauce not used for basting & put it in a saucepan added at least three cups of chicken broth (stirring some of it with 3T of Corn starch) & it was a wonderful lighter gravy & there was plenty of it. Entire dinner was served w steamed fresh carrots & fresh green beans & (canned)baby pototoes (my best quick assistant in the kitchen) IT WAS ALL PERFECT! We added an addtional splash of English mint sauce on our potatoes(not jam-I'll have to upload a recipe for it:",
