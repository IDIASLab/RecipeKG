I plan to pass this recipe out when I give away my starter! (This is also perfect for French toast!)",

In order for your bread to rise, Herman must also rise.  Bubbles alone don't rise bread.  You need Herman to foam to at least 1/3 it's size; although most websites say it should double to make good bread. How do you get it to increase, feed Herman and use or dump some and do it again for several days. Each time, Herman will improve.  As for hydration, the thinner your Herman the more flour you'll need when you bake.  In general, most recipes assume a \"pancake batter\" consistency.  Good luck.",

The instructions should say 'keep adding 1/2 cup of flour until it is ready...'\n\nIt is also a bit on the salty side. The bread by itself is good, but putting any butter or salty spread on it was too much. Next time I am adding 2 tsp. salt, not a tbsp.\n\nI made this in my breadmaker and it came out just fine. Just pour the liquid ingredients in first, then the flour and the dry ones. I processed it in the 'sweet dough' cycle, but the regular white cycle probably would have worked as well.",
