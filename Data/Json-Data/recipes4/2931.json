The potatoes need time to cook. 2) Add the onions about 7 minutes after the potatoes so they don't cook down to nothing. 3) I had to add some liquids to get all the good browned bits off the bottom during the potato cooking time- first time I added about 1/3 c of the chardonnay I was drinking. 2nd time I added about 1/3 c of chicken broth/stock from a can. This allowed the potatoes to steam a little- I left the cover off the potatoes the whole time. 4) I didn't use 3 slices of bacon. I used maybe 1 1/5 slices and browned them first in the skillet. I took the crispy pieces out and processed them in a small food processor. I mopped up 3/4 of the grease w/ a paper towel, but left a little for flavor and 5) I only used about 1 1/2 T of butter. I also added salt and fresh ground pepper. I suppose the wine and the chicken broth made up for the lack of butter, but I felt better about it being a little lower in fat content. I used 5 oz of bleu cheese. They were WONDERFUL. We ate them with filet mignon on the grill and sweet peas. Delicious- you just have to take your time for the best results. You won't be disappointed.",
