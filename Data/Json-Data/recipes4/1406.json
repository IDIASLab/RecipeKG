Used a can of drained diced tomatoes in place of the fresh. Left the skins on the potatoes and mashed them with extra milk and real butter. Instead of the cornstarch and water, I added a packet of brown gravy mix to the beef broth. For the vegetables I used frozen corn, peas, carrots and aspargus. I layered the bottom of the casserole dish with potatoes then the filling with another layer of potatoes on top. Used a combination of shredded colby and cheddar cheese for the topping. Baked at 30 minutes at 375 degrees. This was delish!!!",

I topped the beef/carrot mixture with the can of creamed corn once in the casserole dish, I didn't heat together in the skillet;   The creamed corn tasted like heaven mixed with the saltiness from the Soy Sauce and tang from the Worcestershire. Do try!  I had a similar dish at The Shed Brewery in Stowe, VT. However, they top theirs with Cabot Sharp White Cheddar. I recommend using this if you have access to it (in the specialty cheese section @ your grocery store). I ended up using medium cheddar and it was fabulous- but will definitely splurge next time on Cabot Sharp White Cheddar!",

I omitted the tomato and red pepper because I did not have on hand and added some precooked ground pork sausage. I put in the full amount of curry and thought it really added something to the dish. This was fairly easy and very tasty. My husband had seconds and asked me to make it with double the meat next time (?)
