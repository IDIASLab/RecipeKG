I didn't make mine in the oven, I made mine in the crock pot (a double batch fits well in a 3-quart cooker, if you have an army to feed! lol!) basically just mixing everything together (softening the cream of mushroom soup just for about 30 seconds in the micro to make it easier to stir.) I cooked it on low for about 3 hours, stirred it, and let simmer until I was ready for it. Then, right before serving, I stirred some of the FF Onions in with the beans, then sprinkled some on the top as well. I had a few people at Thanksgiving with an aversion to not only green bean casserole but to mushrooms as well, but they tried it and LOVED IT!!! I guess you could leave out the mushrooms if you have a lot of protesters! :) I WILL be making this again! I will try to add a bit more cheese next time, I like stuff very cheesy! \nOh, I also used the \"Real Bacon Bits\" instead of frying up bacon and crumbling it myself (I'm a lazy cook, I look for shortcuts where I can, heh heh) and it tasted just wonderful! Turkey bacon might be good, too!!! Play around with it, have fun!",

Old English is the one I use when I can't find the Bacon (as a last resort Velveeta-type)and add 1 to 2 T. finely minced cooked bacon. Obviously, the bigger the chop, the less bacon there will be in 1 T.  This recipe doubles or triples nicely.  I have also doubled the amount of green beans without changing the other ingredients and this works well too in a pinch.  Hope this helps ~Deb",

I doubled the recipe and used the kraft old english substitute, frozen greenbeans and no extra mushrooms (also sub cream of celery). I let cook about 4 hours on low. If doing in a crockpot, in the future i would recommend turning off to let the sauce set up (was a little runny.) Also the cheese added a little too much salt, so i just added pepper.

As seen in the italics at the bottom, the velveeta is a substitution and not in the original recipe. I use kraft old english cheese spread. It is in a little glass container that looks like a juice glass almost. I've tried to make this in a crockpot, but it doesn't get the same flavor. I've found that baking it as normal (without adding the french onions) and then transferring it over to a crockpot to keep warm works okay. I do bake the french onions separately to get them crispy, but I serve them in a dish on the side. I do not put them in the crockpot.",
