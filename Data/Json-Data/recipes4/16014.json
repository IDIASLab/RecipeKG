It turned out a little bland (bc of mostly using water as a base) and it had way too much pepper in it for the four of us who tasted it - and I only used half the amount stated in the recipe!  I highly recommend you start out with 1/2 tsp of pepper and go from there.  To help with the blandness, I ended up adding in about 2 tsp of chicken base (Better than Bouillon) which helped tremendously. I also added in more milk.  I can't say I could even taste the hot sauce, but I didn't bother adding more.  I love that this is low fat and low calorie. I will definitely make it again, but with my changes. Thank you Original Lee for the recipe!",
