I also combined the water, honey and yeast and allowed it to sit for 10 minutes prior to adding the remaining ingredients.  I set my bread machine on the dough cycle and then transferred the dough to a greased bread pan when it was finished.  I did not punch the dough down.  I formed it into a loaf shape, covered it with a damp towel, and allowed it to rise for 40 minutes.  I baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees and it turned out beautifully.",

Then I added the liquid (1 1/4 cup water and about another tbl spn added during the kneading) and let the machine knead for about 5 minutes.  I let it rise in a warm place (greased bowl with tight lid floating in a sink of warm water) for 45 minutes, punched it down and put it in a warm oven for 5 minutes and then took it out while the oven pre-heated.  Baked for 40 minutes @ 350.  My husband says I \"bake good bread.\"",
