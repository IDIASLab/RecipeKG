I have only two suggestions about making this soup: At least for the first time resist the temptation to add other vegetables especially greens to the soup because the golden color of this soup is really beautiful and leave some of the vegetables unpureed to add a little texture. Thank you Sara for maybe the best soup recipe I've ever had the pleasure to use!",
