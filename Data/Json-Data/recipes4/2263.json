It was very watery from heating it on the stove and didnt coat it as thickly as I would have liked so I mixed another 1/4 cup brn sugar with 1/4c mustard coocked it and let it cool a bit to thinken before applying that as a second layer. Turned out fantastic, I've never seen my boys each so much meat at one sitting.",

After it came out of the oven I let it rest for about an hour prior to slicing it up on our handy dandy Cabela's meat slicer which was set on a no. 2 setting. It provided just the right thickness for sandwiches which adorned some wonderful homemade buns that the mrs. had made. I know it was a hit because she went back for seconds something she seldom ever does. Thanks for a great recipe!",
