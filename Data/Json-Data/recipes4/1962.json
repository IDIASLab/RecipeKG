I see quite a few complaints on the reduction as being either too thin, or that there's too much left over. Make sure you give the sauce time to reduce(reductions are by no means quick), and know that the more surface area to your skillet, the less time it takes to reduce. Also, if you're trying to do this in a non stick pan, that might be the problem. Use good stainless steel as it is a great heat conductor, and also necessary to properly sear the lamb. I also see complaints about it tasting too \"vinegary\". If you reduce it properly and use high end balsamic vinegar, you should not have this problem. After all, there is no point to CHEAP balsamic vinegar, EVER.",

My husband kept making sounds after biting into it, \"Ooh, Ahhh,ummmm.....\" I would give it ten stars if I could. The lamb was great served on a bed of wild greens and the reduction sauce was perfect drizzled over everything including my rosemary baked potato wedges. It paired well with Nero D'avola's \"Romolo Buccellato\" (a red wine). An unsung hero of a wine, well worth the $8 we paid for it. Next time I'll try shallots instead of onions and I'll look for a nice warm deep mellow balsamic. I'm exciting about making it again, maybe even making it for a dinner party!",

The stuff you buy for $3/bottle is fine for marinades or maybe dressings, but when using basamic as a foundation in a sauce, shoot for upper-end grocery store quality; or even better, swing by a gourmet shop for a high quality vinegar.

I doubled the sauce (& cooking time) and added just a pinch of flour to it near the end to thicken. Soooo tasty.  One tip for other lamb neophytes... the lamb chops i bought were the size of lollipops.  I didn't realize how small they were until I got home because the butcher wrapped them before I saw them.  They were very tender and tasty, but you would've needed at least twice the number of chops to satisfy.  So, check the size of the chops before you buy them and adjust accordingly.  I will absolutely make this again!",

We are huge garlic fans in this house so I seared the lamb in fresh garlic. For the reduction, I reduced for about 17 minutes and added about 2 tbls of heavy whipping cream for some added flavor. I finished off with roasting red potatoes drizzled with olive oil, rosemary, fresh basil and thyme, crushed red pepper and pepper in the oven covered for 20 mins and uncovered for 20 at 405 degrees and green beans.

We followed the recipe exactly with the exception of rubbing the chops with garlic (3 large cloves minced) then rubbed with the mixture. Then seared the chops in the skillet to get some of the marinade in the sauce. Then I finished the chops on the grill. Also doubled the sauce mixture and it took 20-25 min. to cook down, which is a must. I'm not a fan of any kind of vinegar, but this was great. Will make it again and again. Larry",

Boy was this good! The blend of herbs and the reduction sauce were great! Of course because I changed the meat my cooking times were longer but everyone wanted more and said how good it tasted!

Use any cut of lamb (trim excess fat) Brown meat in skillet with a little onion garlic and OO. Remove lamb and add to pressure cooker with tray insert (use about 2 1/2 cups of water). Pressure cook the lamb for 20-23 minutes; turn off let cool 5-10 minutes naturally then cool pressure cooker in cold water. Remove lamb set aside and reserve stock/liquid for the reduction sauce! In a ziploc bag measure 2 generous Tbl. Rosemary and crush really well - then add 1 heaping Tbl. Thyme and 1 scant Tbl. Basil - salt and pepper to taste. Shake the seasonings until well blended. Place the lamb one piece at a time in the ziploc bag and coat evenly with spices - set on a foil lined cookie sheet. Place lamb in the broiler for 5-7 minutes; remove & set aside. Reduction sauce: needs to be doubled! I altered the ingredients/amounts for optimal flavor. 1 1/2 T Olive oil 1/2 cup finely chopped onion 2 cloves minced garlic 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar (make sure to use real good quality balsamic vinegar; the ingredients should not say 'red wine vinegar'!!) 1 T unpacked brown sugar (helps mellow the bold vinegar flavor) 1 1/2 c. lamb stock (reserved from the pressure cooker) 3 T butter Use the skillet the meat browned in; follow the directions for preparing the sauce. Reduce the sauce properly!!! Place the lamb in the sauce & allow meat to mingle for 5 minutes.",
