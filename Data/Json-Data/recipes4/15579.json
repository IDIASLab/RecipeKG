I substituted the calories from the apple juice for brown sugar:) I used all water to make quinoa and 2 tsp. brown sugar instead of agave. I thought 1 tsp cinnamon might be a little much for this little recipe so I went with 1/2 tsp. Thank you for a nice quinoa breakfast recipe. Next time I'm gonna try a banana and maybe 1/4 c. blueberries (a staple in my freezer from Costco) combo.",

I've made it quite a few times over the past year or so too and I keep coming back to it. The recipe is perfect in timing and ingredients in my experiences though I normally put in half the apple at the first 8 minute mark to let it warm up and start sweating before things dry up. Then I put half #2 in along with a teaspoon of sugar and stir things up real well. By the time the second 10 minutes has gone by the apples have gotten incredibly soft and most of the juice has been absorbed by the quinoa or boiled out. I'm actually wondering if people that are having problems with it getting too dry are simply letting it sit at too high a temperature. On my electric stove I start at 7/10 and lower it to 3.5/10 when it boils and cover it.",
