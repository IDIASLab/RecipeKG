It is a very tasty dinner that we have enjoyed and will make again and again. Suggestions: 1. Meat Selection - Do NOT use corned beef brisket.. plain beef brisket should be somewhat marbled with fat for super tender results. 2. Chili Sauce - Use 12oz bottles of Heinz Chili Sauce.  If you can't find it, mix 1C Catsup, 1Tbs Worchestershire sauce and 1tsp dried mustard per pound of brisket instead of the chili sauce. 3. Sliced Onion - Put on bottom of crock pot. 4. Sliced mushrooms are a great addition. 5. Potatoes and carrots - Very tasty addition but cook at least 4 hours, but OK to put in the crock pot at the start. 6. Gravy - I used 2Tbs flour mixed in 1/4 Cup water added to the gravy after removing the meat and veggies.   We planned to do sandwiches the next day, but liked the veggies so well that I added more veggies and made more sauce/gravy without putting meat back in.  7. Extend sauce  - I used 2 Cups catsup, 2 packs onion soup mix, 3 Cups water and 3 beef bullion cubes.  Thickened with flour/water mixture after cooking additional mixture 4 hours.",

The only reason this recipe doesn't have a solid 5 star rating is because some people used red pepper sauce instead of CHILI sauce.  Look for \"CHILI sauce\" near the ketchup.  Hint:  the ingredient is labelled \"Chili Sauce\".  I added sliced onions and 1/2 tsp of black pepper to increase the flavor, but it doesn't need that.  Serve with mashed potatoes, green beans and a salad.",

On Jewish holidays Mom would add a kishke to cook in the pot during the last hour or so.  YUMMY!  Your Cousin's legacy certainly lives on.  Also just a note to you not familiar with brisket.  Brisket and corned beef are not the same thing, although a corned beef is made out of a brisket of beef.  Corned beef has been cured, or \"pickled\" before it is cooked - and has a very distinct taste all its own. The Guiness rcipe on this site is wonderful for corned beef. However the BRISKET called for here is just the plain cut of beef.  I can't imagine what a horrible mess this recipe would be if you used a corned beef............",

I had the chili sauce but didn't have any onion soup mix so in a pinch, I substituted brown gravy mix and added my own sliced onions.  The beef was very tender and the gravy was delicious.  Because I used the brown gravy mix, I didn't have to thicken the sauce.  It did that on it's own.  This one's a keeper.",

Everyone loved this dish - and when the brisket was gone some were just dipping leftover rolls in the remaining sauce!  Very tasty and EASY!!!",
