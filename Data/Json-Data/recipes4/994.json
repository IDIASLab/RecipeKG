Once out of the oven and cooled so they are firm but still warm, drizzle a creamy garlic butter/garlic paste over them. That way you get a nice garlic flavor over the base of cheesy dough.

Instructs are a bit vague and my recipe for uses water instead of the milk. Made recipe twice as follows: 1/2 c water 1/4 margarine or butter (both work) 1/2 c flour 2 eggs 1/2 tsp Garlic Herb seasoning with 1/2 c real Parm. cheese or 1/2 tsp dry ranch mix with 3/4 c cheddar. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Heat water butter and seasoning to a rolling boil. Stir flour in vigourously over low heat until mixture forms a ball. Remove from heat. Beat in eggs all at once with an electric mixer until smooth and a bit drier. Drop by tsp or small cookie scoop onto wax paper lined pan. Bake until puffed and golden. The leavening is the eggs. Important that they are beaten (with a mixer) into the flour mix until smooth and gets a bit drier looking. I baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes for puffs the size of a walnut. Normally puffs are filled with something. Try these sliced open with a chunck of string cheese pepperoni cream cheese etc. Use your imagination. Enjoy!!",

I suspect any low ratings (e.g. coming out flat, not cooking right) may have come from not following the directions exactly.  That is extremely important for this recipe to come out as intended.  Do NOT attempt to skip steps (I know this from experience!).  For instance, skipping step #2 will result in them coming out flat.  Also, be sure to follow the sizing specs when putting them on the pan.  It calls for rounded teaspoonfuls, not tablespoon.  They will come out a respectable size, fully-cooked in the time indicated.  Finally, use an electric mixer!  This will help incorporate the egg into the flour ball and make them more \"puffy.\"",
