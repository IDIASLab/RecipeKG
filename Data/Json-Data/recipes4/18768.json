I used wagyu chuck steak I hadn t used celery or parsley I used three carrots instead of one and I used three tablespoons of tomato paste instead of two. However it still came out fabulous and was the best lagman Ive ever had and I don t really care for Uyghur food... however my husband is Kyrgyz so this is a dish they eat back there and one of his favorite dishes. I also only did 2 cups like a different recipe called for instead of the 8 this one did because I prefer a thicker curry like consistency rather than a soupy one. One other thing I did was use whole cumin instead of the ground one because it s the only cumin I had in my pantry at the time. The second time I cooked lagman I used all the ingredients the recipe called for but also tweaked it to what I thought would taste great. I used 1/3 cup of olive oil instead of 2 tbsp to saut\u00e9 the onions and 0.7 lb of wagyu chuck steak in. I also used ground cumin in addition to a pinch of whole cumin. I used 3 carrots instead of 1 added 3.5 tbsp of tomato paste instead of 2 put 3 star anise into the water phase after you add your potatoes and celery and I also added a bit of bouillon in powder form (not too much maybe a half tbsp) and a dash of Thai chili powder to add a hint of spice towards the end 5 minutes into simmering the garlic and parsley. Man that was soooo fire. (We love spic",
