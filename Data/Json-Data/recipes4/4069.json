I added some sauteed diced onions and bell peppers plus some chopped jalapenos (from a can) to the meat mixture. I also added jalapenos to the cornbread mixture. Also, 2/3 cups of milk for 2 packages of corn bread mix was not enough so I just kept adding until it looked like the right consistency. Finally, because the topping didn't brown in the slow cooker, I removed the crock and put it in the oven on \"broil\" for a couple of minutes. I will definitely make this again.",

I double the meat, double the enchilada sauce, add chilli powder & garlic powder and double the cheese. Sometimes I also add chopped green chili's to the meat mixture. Sure, its just as easy putting this in the oven however, I like cooking things in the slow cooker so I dont have to sit there and watch it... I can throw it in early and have it ready by dinner. Thanks for the reviews this is my first recipe submitted! :)",

I put a towel over the crockpot under the lid, to keep moisture from dripping back down onto the top. (Thanks to Scotdog? for the tip) There was more muffin mix  than the meat mixture. Hubby and I alone ate half of it. It has a good flavor, not quite spicy enough for us and the meat mixture tasted almost sweet to me. Not sure where that came from. Another crockpot recipe that I don't see any point to. This could be made faster and easier in a 13x9 pan and wouldn't be so hard to get out. Onions and garlic added to the meat while browning would help and maybe some cumin also. Next time it goes in the oven and I double the recipe for the meat mixture and maybe the muffin mix too. Thanks Brandy!",

We cooked the hamburger as making taco meat added 1 can (drained) Ro Tel and a choppd green and red pepper. Servied with extra cheese and sour cream once all cooked in the slow cooker. I have both a large oval and stand up 5qt crock pot i used my stand up to make this recipe and only needed the 1 package of cornbread if using an oval crock pot i see needing the 2nd package of corn bread to make 1 layer on top.

Here's what I did: 1 lb. beef & 1 lb. ground turkey 1 can original Rotel 2 cans of kidney beans 1 can of enchilada sauce (I don't care for it) 2 pkg Martha White sweet yellow cornbread mix 2/3 c. milk 2 eggs 4 tbsp melted butter 1 cup shredded 2% cheddar I browned the beef and turkey with adding garlic powder black pepper and onion powder. Once browned I added the rotel with most juice drained so the meat could absorb the flavor. Did that for 10 minutes while mixed up the cornbread milk eggs and butter with the cheese. Put the meat mix in the bottom of the crockpot added the bean and sauce. Mixed up really well. Then poured cornbread mix on top. cooked for 5 hours on low. warmed up nicely the next day in the oven on 400 for about 20 min.",
