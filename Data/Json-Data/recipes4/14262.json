There is no sweetener nor anything other than water to add moisture to the recipe. They were very dry and bitter and only tasting strongly of molasses. I had doubts as I was mixing these up and was sorely tempted to add at least some sugar or honey but gave benefit to the recipe. Again I have to wonder if ingredients were omitted by mistake.",

However the batter is so thick that it's difficult to get it to spread in the muffin pans and they did not rise at all. Very dry too.

This proved to be beneficial for the recipe in that it allowed it to hold some more moisture. I covered the dish while it was cooling and spread some butter on it when I served it. This improved the overall flavor too. Though it is not a recipe I will use again as it is I have come up with some ideas on altering this recipe that I will be sharing in the future.",
