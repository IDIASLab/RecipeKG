After briefly soaking the fish in lemon-water, I dredged the fillets in a mix of 1/2 C flour, 1/4 C cornmeal, a few heaping tbs of grated Parm, ample cayenne and hefty dashes of dill, garlic powder, thyme and salt.  Placed the fish in a broiler pan which was lined with crumpled foil, then misted the fillets with butter spray (no additional fat) to moisten the coating.  Broiled for about 7-8 minutes and the coating browned nicely without drying out the fish.  Thanks for a good 'starter' recipe!",

Someone mentioned the parmesan broiled recipe and that's fine but it's also 13 grams of fat versus the 2 you have here. This is the favorite recipe we've found on this site. It's very quick and easy to make although a little messy. It cooks well and is delicious in our book. We made it with the dijon glazed carrots and traditional mashed potatoe recipes also on this site. YUMMY!! Thanks!",

I don't know if it made any difference with baking but when I coat fish (or anything else) if you refrigerate it 30 minutes or more the coating will stay on better (when pan-frying). It still lacked \"something.\" Next time I'll try 1/2t salt 1/4t red pepper a couple dashes black & a little horseradish in with the egg whites. I'll let ya know...:)",

But my kids said this recipe \"tastes like fish sticks\". And it's MUCH healthier for them. They had it with some homemade fat free tartar sauce. I didn't have cornmeal and used only Italian bread crumbs. I didn't use the basil either. If I'd had a little lemon I would have added some lemon juice after I baked it. For those who found this to be bland tilapia by nature is a very mild fish. You'll definitely have to add spices if you want this dish to have some punch. Thank you for this recipe. It's a keeper!",
