A lot of the recipes resulted in pancakes that were too flat and broke apart when flipping. I wanted a recipe that was like the Aunt Jemima&reg; pancakes I grew up with: delicious and fluffy. After much experimentation with recipes and reading forum comments, I finally put together something reminiscent of childhood quality pancakes. Top with maple syrup and fresh fruit.",

I think the temperature recommended here is too high because my first batch almost burned outside yet undone on the inside. Turning down the heat helped get a crisp outside and a soft inside. I used agave and flax seed milk instead of honey and water. I only needed about 3 Tbsp of liquid. To get a fluffy pancake don't let the batter get too thin so add your liquid Tbsp by Tbsp to control the consistency better. Thank you Craig for the recipe.",

I have made them several times and subbed out the milk with almond milk the eggs with egg replacer and used applesauce in place of the oil. They are amazing!
