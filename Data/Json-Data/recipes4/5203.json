                "reviewBody": "I am giving this recipe 4 stars only because of the directions presented. I read and re-read them several times before making it. Because of my difficulty in at first deciphering the instructions I've also taken the time to post several photos at various stages of the process. First you do not need to separate ALL of the crescent rolls; simply detach the rolls into four rectangles (each one = two rolls). Press together the center perforations and lay on your cookie sheet or pizza pan in a daisy-like formation. Second scoop 1/2 cup of filling onto the lower edge of the rectangle (closest to the center of the daisy) and folder over the other 2/3's of the pastry and seal into balls making sure they are adjoining. In my opinion making this recipe into a 'wreath' is kind of pointless -- since it is served warm the first thing I did upon removing it from the oven (but after taking the picture!) was to cut it apart for serving. The next time I make this (and I will!) I'll simply bake individual servings. They could be decorated with pastry cut-outs if desired. Overall this is a great recipe for using up leftover turkey. My adult daughter my husband and three-year-old grandson all liked it as did I. The only ingredient I modified was using shredded \"Italian blend\" cheese instead of Swiss because that is what I had on hand. Tasty filling basically healthy -- will definitely make it again sometime!",

It is a delicious and festive dish for a holiday gathering. Place tin foil on the baking pan for smarter transfer to a serving layers. To create smaller bite sized servings use the crescent roll dough SHEET and hand cut out 16 smaller sized triangles. Overlap each triangle as you arrange in a circle. Place the turkey-cranberry filling on the base of the triangle and then pull the pointed end over the filling. If your triangle is long enough making a twist over the filling makes a nice touch. Don't forget to brush the dough with the egg for a lovely golden brown.",
