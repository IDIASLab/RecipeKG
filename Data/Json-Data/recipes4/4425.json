Based on another reviews comments I doubled the wine cream butter and garlic to make more sauce and I am glad that I did. I also used Fettuccine noodles but suggest you sick with the smaller pasta because my sauce was thin. I also used think cut smoked bacon.

However I would like to leave a review for the pescatarians that may be considering making this dish. I left out the bacon and sprinkled just a little bit of vegetarian bacon bits on the dish at the end. I used diced sundried tomatoes which gave the flavor but hurt the texture a bit. Overall I would give this 3 stars for a pescatarian meal because it lacked flavor. My boyfriend did enjoy this dish but I doubt I will make it again. If I do I will have to make some major modifications and will probably not use the bacon bits.",
