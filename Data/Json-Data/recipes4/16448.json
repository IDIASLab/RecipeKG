The dough was extremely easy to handle and clumped up in my hands easily and spread well. My problem is they did not turn out crunchy, despite baking longer. I did not have parchment paper, so this could have been the issue. I did make them quite thin, even where they browned heavily on the edges they did not remain crisp once they cooled down. I was very disappointed in this as this is the reason I wanted the cracker. I will have to look over other recipes and see how I can make a crisp cracker. Flavor was great though!",
