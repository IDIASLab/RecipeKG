The directions say to grill in foil so I didn't see a reason why oven would be much different. Turned out well and was also perfect for a light lunch the next day. I think this would have been great with fresh basil instead of spinach for a little extra flavor.",

I really used this recipe, but my former one had zucchini in it so I added that.  Here's what I did..foil packets, sliced zucchini in rows, fish on top of that, then what the recipe called for with the tomatoes, spinach, onions.  Same spices and olive oil and balsamic.  My cod was quite thick so I baked (didn't have access to grill) it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Some people mentioned it gets too \"saucy\" and they may not like the added zucchini for that reason but we liked it.  Only when I served it, I put a little feta on it.  That's my version and it was delicious, light and healthy, so I thank the original poster of this recipe.",

I followed the recipe, except doubled the fresh spinach and used fresh minced garlic.  Next time, I want to try Swiss  or some other mild, soft cheese that has a bit more flavor than mozzarella (which didn't add much to the dish, in my opinion).  I'm thinking Swiss or Jarlsberg because they would add a buttery, nutty flavor that would likely pair well with the other ingredients. Will definitely make again!  Thanks!",
