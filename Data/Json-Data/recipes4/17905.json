My only change was using fresh chopped tomatoes rather than the paste. I had to let it simmer a bit longer before and after adding the chicken to get the consistency I wanted but it was so worth it. They key here is patience, let things just barely simmer slowly and taste as you go. I made it with the recommended cabbage/potato dish (also posted by the user Twin Cities) and enjoyed with injera. Everyone went back for seconds and mopped up the sauce with the bread. Thanks for posting - I'm adding this to my \"show-off\" recipe box for sure! Of note: I've seen this served with a lightly dressed green salad or collard greens if you want to simplify the side dish.",

I will soon post the Authentic way of making it so you can enjoy.. \nFirst, buy a whole chicken, clean and let soak in cool water with lemon and salt. \nFinely cut yellow jumbo onions (not sweet) about 7-8 onions. You want to fill the pot more than half way as it will cook down. \nAdd cooking oil, about 3/4 of a cup. Once onions are mostly cooked, add berbere. 3/4 of cup and let cook for another 45 minutes.. add 5 tomatoes after 25 minutes into the 45 minutes.. boil water in separate pot and add the chicken to it.. add water to the onions filling about 3/4 of the pot. After 25 minutes add the chicken to the onions and let it cook for another 45 minutes not stirring so often so the chicken doesn\u2019t fall apart.. boil eggs in separate pot, once done, take shell off and add four slits in the egg and add to pot of chicken when there is 10 minutes left or the water has reduced to your liking. Scoop excess oil from top of pot (Optional)  and you\u2019re done. Should take no less than 2 1/2 hours. This dish is about patience",
