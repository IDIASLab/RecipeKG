Trust me the kids will never know there's fresh spinach in this because all you really taste is the fruitiness with not one fruit dominating. We eat with our eyes and I can't say that I'm crazy about the brownish color but it does taste good and this breaks down great nutritionally. Thanks Laurie C. for sharing your recipe.",
