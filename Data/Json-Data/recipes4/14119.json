I definitely recommend adding the tomatoes - I don't think they should be optional as they added a wonderful flavor to the sauce that it needs! I gave it 4 stars because I wasn't sure if I was doing things correctly. I cooked the chicken just as stated in the recipe but I thought it was weird to add the water when there was so much oil in the pan. I don't think it needs that much oil to brown the chicken either. Save the fat and cut it down a lot!. When I made the sauce it said to \"add it to the pot...\" Does that mean the pot with the chicken oil & water in it?? I opted to make the sauce in a separate pot and am SO very glad I did! When the chicken was done I removed it from the grease & water and let it drain on paper towels (removed the skin too as we don't care for it). Then I put the chicken on a serving dish and put the sauce on top - it was beautiful! I served it with rice pilaf. Thanks again and if the recipe submitter reads this please clarify if you leave the oil in the pan when adding the water to the chicken and also clarify how the sauce is made...in it's own pot or in the pot with the chicken.",
