It IS a mug recipe but I wanted to turn it out and it crumbled all to pieces. Probably not a problem if eaten in the mug. 3) This recipe calls for no added sugar. It is very minimally sweet. I would have given this 3 stars but when I offered it to my grandson who doesn't eat a lot of sweets he gobbled it right up and thought it was great. So 4 stars it is!",
