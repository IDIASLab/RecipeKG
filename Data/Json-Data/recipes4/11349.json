Let the flavors blend overnight but add the crumbled bacon just before serving so it stays crunchy. You can also toss this w/ some chopped mixed greens. Thanks for the recipe.",

I scaled the recipe down--I only had one jar of hearts of palm and a smaller one at that--so I only used one packet of dressing and I followed the directions on the packet for less oil (1/4 c oil 1/4 c water) but left out the water. Even leaving out the water and with the addition of some tomatoes and a large cucumber to this salad there is too much dressing. The amount of oil was fine in the dressing itself but I'd say half the amount of dressing would be fine and would still allow the flavors to meld. I certainly like the salad and will probably make it again but I'll definitely cut back on the dressing. Thanks for the recipe!",
