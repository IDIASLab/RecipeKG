I grilled a few extra breasts to use for later and decided to use them for this recipe. Tonight I diced 3 chicken breasts and added about a cup of mayo (love mayo) a handful of chopped walnuts a couple handsful of seedless green grapes (quartered) the can of mandarin oranges some dried dill weed a sprinkling each of garlic powder and onion powder and a pinch of salt. Dinner was ready in 5 minutes and my whole family adored it! (Well the 7 and 4 year olds picked out the walnuts...) The mandarin oranges gave it such a wondeful flavor so fresh tasting. I don't like fruit or chicken that much but this was delicious. I will be making this all the time.",
