I never make pork chops, but my husband loves them, and I made these and they were awesome, and so much healthier than pan-fried!!\nThe only changes I made were using Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs and I dipped the pork chops in flour before dipping them in the egg mixture. Also, when I flipped the chops, I sprayed the pan again with some non-stick spray and sprayed the tops of the pork chops. They were nice and crunchy!",

I added a little garlic and parmesan cheese to the mix and they turned out MOUTH-WATERINGLY DELIGHTFUL. Wolfgang, who loves pork chops as much as Homer Simpson said they are the best CHOPS he\u2019s ever had but that they still don\u2019t rank up there with my tuna casserole.

I didn't use the milk and the coating stuck to the chops just fine.  I used very thin pork chops and baked them as directed.  They tasted fine and we'll probably make them again.  Hubby liked them also.  I don't usually give a 5 star unless we are blown away by a recipe and we find a 4 star is something we love and a 3 star is acceptable.  I don't understand folks who rate everything a 5 star - if you do that then there's no way to define awesome from plain old good enough!",
