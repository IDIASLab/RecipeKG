The only changes I made was to use cubanelle peppers instead of green (too expensive this time of year), red kidney beans instead of black, and 1 tsp of ground chipotle chili pepper instead of the 2 tsp of annatto - it's what I had on hand. I served it as a side dish to the Cuban Pork Roast and Spicy Mango Salsa recipes also found on this site. Will definitely make again. Thank you, Jen!",
