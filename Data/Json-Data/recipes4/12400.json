I washed off the fish pieces the next day and gave it to my dogs they liked it.",

And I didn't have any green chile peppers so I used about a tablespoon crushed red peppers in it's place. and 1 tablespoon mustard powder. That time it tasted WONDERFUL. So I decided to make more and used the 3 tablespoons of mustard powder and I see that's where the recipe goes wrong. It's too much mustard seeds they're saying to use and not only does it eclipse the other flavors you can't even taste the salt when you add as much mustard seed as they tell you. So just add 1 tablespoon for the flavor (maybe less).",

This turned out GREAT with no bitter taste whatsoever. I liked this much better than I anticipated. The fish ends up tender rich and none of the ingredients are too pungent at all. Not even the chile pepper. Great recipe and one I recommend with my one change.",
