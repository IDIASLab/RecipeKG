My only problem was that although I could put the herb covered butter pats under the skin I couldn't rub the rest of them on the chicken; even though they were soft the chicken was cold and it wouldn't adhere to the skin. I ended up melting the butter pats and brushing the herb/butter mixture on the skin which worked fine. Definitely would make again; my boyfriend loved it!",

It's difficult to rub the butter mixture on the chicken so I think I'll melt the butter next time. The skin was crispy and the chicken was moist. As for the gravy I needed more than 1 tablespoon of flour. I used 4 tablespoons. I didn't even use the full 32oz of chicken broth since I used 3/4 cup for my dressing. The gravy was very good. I strained the pan juices first then added the flour. After that I noticed there were lumps and little bits of flour that wouldn't dissolve so after the gravy thickened I placed it in the food processor until it was smooth. Then it was ready to serve. I made this today for thanksgiving. I recommend this recipe. Thank you for sharing.:)",

Normally I roast my chicken breast up and I've gotten pretty good at knowing when it is just done so the breast stays nice a juicy but roasting the chicken using the method in this recipe was fool-proof. The basting during the process also produced a lovely bird.
