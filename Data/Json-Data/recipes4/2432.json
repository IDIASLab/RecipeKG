Instead form it into logs then cook for 3 hours on a broiler pan then flip them and cook another 3 hours. After they are done you take them out of the oven and wrap each separate beefstick in foil then refrigerate. Just wanted to clarify that. Sorry it took so long.",

First off I could not tell the difference in letting the meat sit 3 days and mixing for 5-10 minutes per day and the second batch where I mixed mine one day rest overnight and cooked the next day. Second the first batch came out greasy so in the second batch I used 90/10 ground sirloin and it was drastically less greasy. Third store the cooked sticks in an airtight container in the fridge. They have a much longer shelf life since they have no preservates or chemicals to keep the flavor.",
