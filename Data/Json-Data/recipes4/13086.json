Browning helps melt excess fat and enhances the flavor. --When done cooking cool and refrigerate overnight. Skim the excess fat from the surface then reheat. It tastes even better the second day. Love the spice combo. It really makes the dish sing.",

I added 1 tsp chopped chillies 1 tbsp of garam masala an extra tin of tomatoes fresh cherry tomatoes & I left out the carrots and mushrooms ( I just couldn't add them to a rogan josh!) I don't have a slow cooker so I browned the lamb shank & then added the sauce & veg - simmered it for 4 hours & the meat fell off the bone. I kept the potatoes large and it took this length of time to cook them perfectly. We enjoyed it with these changes.",

So I made the recipe with 12 lbs. (triple batch) of beef short ribs instead for my family today (Christmas Eve). They loved it! Amazing how the ingredients still result in a very down-home midwestern beef stew impression. Nice rich blend of flavors! Good \"bad weather trapped indoors\" food.:) Space caveat though: took me 2 crock pots plus 1 pot on the stove (to accomodate the potatoes) to make the triple batch. Will definitely make this again! Reheats nicely with a little mozzarella and/or provolone on top.",

It was hard for me to imagine how this would taste but it comes together very nicely and you don't end up with any one of the flavors overpowering the others. I have a hard time imagining the person who wouldn't like this. The \"broth\" would also be great with beef or I could even see it with a heavier fish like salmon. We cooked this in a dutch oven for 3 hours at 350 degrees and it was perfect. We used two concentrated broth pouches instead of the bullion just out of preference. Otherwise we followed the recipe just as it is. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",
