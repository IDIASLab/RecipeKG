I used stock and one tablespoon of homemade onion soup mix from this site.  Turned out very tender and juicy.  There were three eating and we all enjoyed. But for me personally I just love roasted turkey. This didn't do it for me. I gave it four stars as it was easy, good and everyone liked it. Just me personally, I would roast in the future. This would be great for me in the future if I was going for turkey sandwiches or soup.  But for me, I just can't give up on my roasted turkey.  Still a great recipe.",
