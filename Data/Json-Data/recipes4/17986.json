I estimated on a lot of the measurements but it came out fine. I don't think age really mattersI am I never actually thought of adding ginger to smoothies. But it really enhanced the flavor. I didn't have any orange juice so I put a few teaspoons of lemon juice instead. Than more water. I thought it looked a bit watery so I looked for ice in the freezer. But I couldn't find any do I added an extra banana. I was really satisfied with the results and I am definitely going to make it again.",
