I didn't add the cream to the whole batch of soup - those would wanted to tone down the spice could add some - I personally liked it without the cream and it saves a ton of calories.   This might serve 4 as a first course but not 4 for dinner.   Thanks for a great recipe.  :)",

I added a touch more seasoning to suit New Orleans' palates and used 1/2 fat-free half & half and 1/2 heavy cream. It was delicious. Thanks to you!",

I took the advice of another reviewer and sauteed the onion and garlic (needs much more than one clove!) for a few minutes. I added the cajun seasoning during this stage and also added some cayenne pepper and sriracha sauce. I also decided to split the broth adding half chicken and half chipotle bullion. It was easier to just add a teaspoon of heavy cream to each bowl served adding a full cup (I doubled the recipe) seemed too decadent. Chives and a few blue cheese crumbles worked wonderful as a garnish. Thank you for posting this great recipe!",

Instead of heavy cream I used plain greek yogurt reducing the fat content and increasing the protein content of the dish. I also didn't have cajun seasoning so I just sprinkled a bit of cayenne pepper into it. In addition I added a bit of honey which was the best idea that I had when it came to this recipe.

Halfway through cooking I added white sugar and black pepper to taste. I only added about half the cream the recipe called for I wanted to retain the orange color but I wouldn't leave the cream out because I like the texture it gave the soup. (It definitely could be omitted and it would be an awesome vegan recipe). This recipe is definitely a keeper!! The pumpkin cooked down so well this is my first time cooking with pumpkin aside from desserts or bread and I am impressed. Thank you!",
