I cooked this with 3 large frozen chicken breasts & knew I would be gone all day at work. It got 7 hours in the crock pot on low & I shredded the chicken instead of cubing it because it started out frozen. Added almost 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes & some black pepper because that is our thing. It tastes good - I would tweak it with veggies & onions next time. Good base! Thanks!",

Over time I have found that when I take the chicken out of the slow cooker to cut up I can add the cream cheese (cut into 6 or 8 smaller pieces) and the soup to the hot Italian mix and just whisk by hand right in the slow cooker. This saves me from dragging out the mixer. I then add frozen peas the cubed chicken and a little seasoning. I let it warm up about another 30 minutes. It's really wonderful over rice. Thanks for the great recipe!",
