I was in the mood for a melt-in-your-mouth candy for midnight snacking and Redneck Grandma directed me to this recipe. Boy am I glad she did! I toasted my walnuts in a skillet before adding it to the fudge and I used silicone cupcake liners sprayed with a bit of non-stick cooking spray to make individual servings of the fudge. I stuck them in the freezer in an airtight container for about an hour and they were set-up perfectly and ready for eating. It is very hard to stop at just one piece of this delectable fudge. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.",

However, I decided to try this recipe because the submitter is a talented cook. I am so glad I did. The fudge is fabulous. I used Ghiradelli white chocolate chips and added extra walnuts (personal preference). Fast, easy, and delicious \u2013this recipe is a keeper.",

I got the idea from another who made this recipe to use some candy cup papers and I used a small cookie scoop to measure fudge into each cup. The papers peel off easily and you have perfect looking and even tastier fudge! I added some vanilla butternut in place of maple extract. I made a large batch to package up for the bake sale at my daughter's elementary school Halloween Carnival. Huge hit and my go-to recipe!   :)",

It finally did make it into the pan and the fridge, so I'm now waiting (impatiently) for it to set up.

Second, a double boiler works fine if you prefer it over the microwave.  Third, a 9x9 pan would work fine in place of 8x8; the fudge would still be plenty thick.  Fouth,1 teaspoon Watkins brand imitation maple flavor was plenty of maple flavor.  Hope this helps.  Thanks SHORECOOK for another great recipe.",
