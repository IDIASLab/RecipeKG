I am giving the recipe 4 stars because of the flavor and texture of the dough. It really is very good and I will be making it again so thank you for sharing it with all of us. I did however need to add flour to the dough since it did not reach a very soft dough ball without it. Since I needed it to be GF & dairy free I could not use cheese so in place of cheese we make a white sauce with coconut oil GF flour mixture unsweetened almond milk & then use nutritional yeast & spices to season it. It really is quite good and I used that in place of the tomato sauce for this pizza. I then added spinach broccoli onion garlic red bell pepper. It was gobbled up in minutes!! Thank you again for your recipe.",

I added the honey and yeast to 3/4 cup of water afraid that my flour mix didn t need a whole cup of liquid. In fact I never needed the other 1/4 cup. I reluctantly added two tbsp of oil but am happy with the results. I used fresh zucchini and cayenne peppers instead of heirloom tomatoes. Thank you for the recipe.",
