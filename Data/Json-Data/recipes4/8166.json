This is more like a baked turkey burger than a meatloaf... and it was very difficult to cut without it crumbling.  This is because this recipe is missing a binder.. crumbs, almond meal, crackers.. ground oats...egg.. anything to hold it together.  I will make this again as I like the taste.. but with crumbs and egg added",
