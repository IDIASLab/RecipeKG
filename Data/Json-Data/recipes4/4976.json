As it was the salt gave me a headache after eating. The baking method was easy. I only pulled ribs out 2 times to brush on BBQ sauce--there was plenty to keep it moist. I did this in 15 minute intervals at 350 convection bake. I had 3 racks of ribs and they were moist and very tender. I will definitely make again with the salt change -- the idea of grilling after the first 2 hours would be great.",
