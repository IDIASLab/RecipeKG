Maybe it's in the asian in me that likes to marinate everything... but if you marinate the beef in 2 tb of soy sauce, 1 tsp sugar, 2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce and a 1/4 of salt for 15 minutes before sauteing...it adds a world of difference to the flavor in the beef.  It no longer just just tastes like tomato sauce drenched in flavorless meat.  Also add salt and pepper to the meat (to taste) while sauteing with the onions and garlic and peppers before adding to the sauce.",

I like my sauce more creamy with the tomatoes less chunky, so I use \"crushed\" instead of diced tomatoes.  I love mushrooms, so I also add a 7 ounce jar (drained) of button mushrooms (usually Pennsylvania Dutchman available at my regular grocery).  The button type mushrooms are good because they are easy to see in the sauce and can be left off the spoon for those eaters who don't like them.",
