I reckoned that it would work brilliantly in a barbecue sauce -- and our kids agreed. You can use as a barbecue mop in the last 30 minutes of cooking your meat on the barbecue or marinate chicken or other meat in sauce for at least 30 minutes before cooking in oven or on barbecue. Do not grill or bake for longer than 45 minutes, as the sugar syrups and tomato ketchup are likely to burn and make the food taste bitter.",

We're an incredibly busy family (who isn't?) and it saves time to prep ahead. I've made this in a larger batch and stored it in the kitchen for a week. We've used it on roasts burgers & chicken. The roast went in the slow cooker with this. For the burgers I had made sliders and left a little out as one of the sauce choices. For the chicken we had breaded cutlets and I drizzled some over them. It's been a versatile sauce. Good stuff thanks for posting it!",
