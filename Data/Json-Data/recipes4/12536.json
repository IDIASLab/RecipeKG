I was looking for something to make with diced tomatoes smoked sausage and rice because it was what I had in the house. I browned 14 oz of smoked sausage in 2tbsp butter and 1/2 tbsp minced garlic. I didn't use any tomato sauce so I only added 1/2 cup of water and also only 1/2 lbs of green beans and mine were frozen. I spiced it up with 1/2 Tbsp basil 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. Served it over rice but it would be good over pasta too. It turned out great the only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because I altered it a bit!",
