The lime at the end adds a lot. I wasn't sure how much to buy and ended up with extra mushrooms and red onions. Because I was using leftover chicken I had less chicken. I'm not suggesting altering the recipe just pointing out that it's flexible. I have been learning more about using quinoa and I find that because I'm rinsing first as recommended by many I use just 1 cup of water for cooking the quinoa.",
