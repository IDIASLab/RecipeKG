My kids had NO clue they were eating gluten free! (My daughter needs enzymes in order to consume wheat or milk products.) She thought they tasted like the real thing.\n\nI did change a few things.... instead of the canola oil, I used applesauce. Instead of the buttermilk powder and 2 cups of water, I used almond milk. It was a little runny (so, I'd probably add the almond milk until it was the perfect consistancy.) I also added some dried blueberries to the mix. :)\n\nOther than that, they were fluffy & thick and oh so good! The batch was big enough for me to freeze some. Every morning my kids wake up and ask for more yummy pancakes. Thanks a lot for posting this :)",

I used rice flour from an asian food market because it's ground so fine that you don't get that gritty taste that some rice flours have in the finished product. Instead of artificial sweetener I used one tablespoon of sugar. To one cup of the batter I added 1/2 cup frozen blueberries. To another cup of batter I grated one medium apple and added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon.\nMy family loved them and there was no aftertaste that some flours leave. Can't say enough about how great these were!!!",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent!  It really does have a consistency and taste comparable to wheat flour pancakes.  Much to the dismay of my long suffering family, I've tried many gluten free pancake recipes and store bought mixes...all of which have been disappointing.  I made a few changes to adapt to the fact that I couldn't buy dry powdered buttermilk, only dry powdered whole milk.  Since I substituted regular milk powder I also added 2 T (heaped) sour cream.  I also added 1/3 C additional water as the batter seemed a bit too thick.    Instead of xanthan gum I used 4T of gluten substitute.  I have found that the gluten substitute replicates the texture of normal wheat flour much better than xanthan gum.  Generally you use 2T/20 grams of gluten sub for every 1C/+-100 grams of gluten free flour mix.  I also added a can of rinsed blueberries which made them extra tasty!  I had extra batter left over which I used the next morning with the same great results.  Thank you Joe for this great recipe (my family thanks you even more)!",

I have a grain mill so I used 1/4 cup brown basmati rice and 1/3 cup regular brown rice milled to make 1 cup flour. I also used 1 1/2 cups lo-fat buttermilk since I didn't have buttermilk powder (use in place of water and buttermilk powder). I don't like the taste of artificial sweetners so I used 8 drops of stevia liquid (an herbal substitute for sugar)in place of the packet of sugar substitute. They turned out great and I have used this recipe for family and guests alike and received rave reviews. No one has even asked me if they are gluten-free. You can add blueberries too. YUM!

I was afraid my kids wouldn't like them because we are used to eating whole wheat pancakes made with hard white wheat milled in our grain mill and eat them several times per week. My oldest son who is very picky loved them! He said that they were so good you don't even need syrup with them. The texture was perfect and I am glad I doubled the recipe so I can freeze some. Here are the changes we made: 1 cup freshly ground long grain brown rice flour was what I used for the rice flour rather than art. sweetener 1 1/2 tbsp maple syrup added to the liquid ing. Just under 2 c. buttermilk rather than milk/powder mixture I also substituted 3 tbsp melted butter for the oil mixing it into the liquid mixture with a hand blender. So good! This saves breakfast for my pancake eating family.",

For anyone who needs it, just mix 1 part baking soda, 1 part cornstarch and 2 parts cream of tartar.  For this particular recipe I omitted the cornstarch since the recipe itself already had tapioca starch and potato starch.  Thanks for a great recipe!",
