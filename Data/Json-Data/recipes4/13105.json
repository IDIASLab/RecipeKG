I made some slight modifications though: instead of a chili pepper I added a milder Anaheim pepper and I used 2 limes instead of the recommended 3. It came out a little too sour still so I think I am going to use only 1 lime next time. I also used Isreali couscous instead mainly because it was the ony thing I had. My father-in-law (who we live with) cannot handle spicy food very well and even he found the substitution of the Anaheim in good taste. The only reason I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the nutrition/calorie content. I didn't look at the nutrition facts until after I made/ate it otherwise I probably wouldn't have made it.",

It seemed as if the eggplant was not quite done whether that was the size of the chunks I cut it in or the times I'm not sure. I think for the veggies they either need an increased cooking temp or time plus they were a little bland perhaps a mix of some herbs and a touch of salt & pepper on them as well. Overall I think that it has alot of promise it just needs a little tweaking.",
