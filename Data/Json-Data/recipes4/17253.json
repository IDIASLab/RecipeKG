Fortunately, I covered my bowl with a lid so I didn\u2019t have to clean the entire microwave. 1 minute is sufficient time. If you want a runny yolk, I would recommend 45 seconds. Also, add more water for a \u201cpoached\u201d egg. Mine turned out more like a hard-boiled egg but without the perfect egg shape. A little flavoring would be nice too. In my opinion, vinegar doesn\u2019t go well with eggs. Maybe some salt and pepper would be better",
