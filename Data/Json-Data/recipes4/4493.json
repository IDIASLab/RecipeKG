Now that I have see two reviews stating the fries/wedges are too \"mushy\" I am thinking cooks are boiling for 20 minutes and not until fork tender. If you boil till fork tender, the \"mushy\" quality should hopefully not be an issue. Remember, recipes are a guideline to discovering what you like best. So learn, practice, experiment, and don't be afraid to mess. Happy Cooking!",
