Once I started cooking the chicken mixture I knew that 16 oz of linguine would overwhelm this casserole so I cut back to about 12 oz and that still was plenty of pasta (you really do want to taste the chicken-tomato mixture). I added salt pepper and some red pepper flakes to add a little zing. One word of caution. The recipe says to cook the chicken-tomato mixture until the liquid has almost evaporated. Don t go overboard because the pasta will absorb some of the liquid and my casserole ended up a little dry. Honestly had concerns about cheddar cheese (kept thinking parmesan and mozzarella) but it was good. Just be prepared to adjust the seasonings to your tastes and you ll be fine. I m the first reviewer so none of this is meant to be negative because we did enjoy this dish.",

I used only about 12oz of linguine based on other reviews of it turning out bland or dry, and it was a good ratio of pasta to chicken. I also rinsed out the pasta with hot water after draining it to keep it from drying and sticking. I used 2 cups of Rotel diced tomatoes and that worked great for flavor and moisture. For cooking times I did 10 minutes cooking the chicken and misc and 10 minutes after adding the tomatoes and misc. I also added a lot more cheese than was called for including cheddar, Parmesan, and mozzarella all shredded, and sprinkled mostly cheddar and Parmesan on top before baking for 16-18 minutes. It wasn\u2019t dry at all, and it was awesome for leftovers! Served with a fresh garden salad",

Still it tasted great.\" I guess I'm glad that the title was misleading (in that nothing is actually \"baked\" and the oven's only purpose is to re-heat all the items together w/ melty cheese) b/c I enjoyed the ease of arranging this in the morning and fridging it until putting it in the oven at dinnertime. I broke the linguine into thirds b4 boiling (didn't relish the idea of us twirling noodles whilst stabbing at chicken when it came time to eat and when I make again I'll probably use a smaller pasta like penne or rotini) and used a can of Italian-seasoned tomatoes for the 2 c. diced tomatoes called for. We really enjoyed this alot and will look forward to eating it again.",
