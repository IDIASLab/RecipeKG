After making stew with it, I decided to make the same gravy mix & put it over pot roast with equally delicious results.

We enjoyed it, but I would say it's more like a beef-stroganoff, as there are no vegetables included in the stew.  I substitued low-fat cream of mushroom soup for the regular; I would have also done the same for the cheddar cheese soup but I couldn't locate the low-fat version. I also couldn't find the beef-onion dry soup mix, so I had to use the basic onion soup instead.  I used only 2 lbs. of stew meat, as I was only cooking for the two of us.  I served it over garlic mashed potatoes, with a side of steamed asparagus.  I'll make it again!",

Add 1/2 a cup of wine to the original recipe.  3 Marinate the beef overnight in wine and season salt.  Each person loved it and will make it again.",

I then added 2 pinches of crushed red pepper flakes and set my slow cooker on high for the recommended time. I did add a little bit of water, maybe 1/4 cup to thin it out just a little to what I consider stew consistency. In the last hour I added a can each of green beans, corn and sliced mushrooms (all drained) and half a bag of frozen peas. My fiancee kept commenting on how good it smelled while it was cooking. And it tasted fantastic! The red pepper flakes added a wonderful, light spice to the whole thing. With my additions this reminded me of a stew my mom would make when I was a kid called Cowboy Stew.
