I do change the recipe in the sense that I have cocoa powder and make the hot chocolate out of that instead of the instant taste all the better IMO. But the addition of the cinnamon and the pinch of chili powder make a good cup of homemade hotchocolate into a FANTASTIC treat. Just those two things change the ordinary into a very special very YUMMY drink. Thanks so much for this recipe Mexican Hot Chocolate is the best hot chocolate I've ever had.",

It reminds me of Farmer Brothers Monterey Hot Chocolate (which I love and they don't stock it in the grocery store only at a cafe I've been to). So it's great that now I can make it at home!:) Also I used a 1/2 cup of milk instead of the 1/4 cup then 1/2 cup of water instead of the 3/4 cup. I do think that next time though I'll add the water first before adding the milk. When I added the milk first(like it says to) then added the water everything was all clumpy. So I had to stick it back in the microwave for another minute. It still turned out very good though. And definately a keeper! I can't wait for it to get cold outside again to have it more often!",
