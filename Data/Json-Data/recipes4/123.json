My slow cooker was being used for something else that day so a few hours before dinner I threw the veggies and beans into a pot on the stove brought to a boil and let simmer until dinner. I doubled the recipe for my family of 6 plus we had leftovers. I added 3 cans of light and dark kidney beans. I did not drain the beans the chili really needed all that liquid to come to a simmer.I pulsed the whole tomatoes in the blender a couple times and added another can of diced tomatoes.I doubled everything except the chili powder.I used 1 Tbsp. and it was still a bit spicy but not too spicy for the kids.It was sooo good! We topped it with shredded cheese and served this with cornbread.I will definitely make this again next time in the slow cooker!",
