I also stirred some seasoned pepper thyme garlic parsley oregano and seasoned salt into the veg. while they were cooking. I used a full can of milk and added some lt. sour cream to the soup mixture. For the chz. I used about a cup of mild cheddar and a cup of sharp cheddar (both reduced fat). For the topping I mixed seasoned breadcrumbs with saltine crackers and about two tablespoons of marg. I also sprinkled a little sharp cheese under the topping. This filled a 9x13 pan. My husband loved this and went back for seconds. I definately recommend making changes to the original recipe to jazz it up otherwise this would be very bland.",

The only change  I made to the cheese sauce was to add 1 tsp of dry mustard powder.  I cooked 4 cups of macaroni as suggested by other reviewers and I also added about 1-1.5 cups of diced leftover ham.  Lastly, instead of breadcrumbs for the topping, I crushed up some Ritz crackers, mixed with some shredded cheddar cheese and dumped a few tablespoons of melted butter of the top; this is a fabulous topping that my mother uses when she makes mac & cheese.  The dish turned out really, really good...but I think next time I make it, I will add 3 cups of macaroni only, DH and I would like the cheese sauce a little more moist, but this is only a personal preference.",

Also add vegetable - I love this with broccoli or asparagus but corn carrots mushrooms etc...all work well.

I followed some previous suggestions and included a bag of frozen broccoli - this was a very good suggestion to round out the meal.  We also included more milk as some previous posters suggested but when we make it again, I think I'll stick with the 1 cup like the recipe recommends (just too milky for our tastes).  We did include more cheese, but we're cheese-lovers so we do that most of the time.  I can see where the 1/4 cup of dijonaise mustard would add some extra kick.  We might try that next time.  Definitely a tasty way to re-do the ham, overall!  I think this one is a keeper.",
