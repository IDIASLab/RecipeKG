Now some people will tell you that stuffing small olives is a pain in the neck but I have have a much lower opinion!... Ditto for the breading!... The small olive results were quite good but not enough oliviness for my taste.... The larger olives however were MUCH easier to handle.... After trying both I present my findings: #1 the stuffing mixture is good and works in both sorts of olive and is really quite good without the breading and frying.... #2 single-coated breading is a waste of time because subsequent frying (I shallow fry mine - rolling them around as they cook) makes the stuffing ooze out completely from the smaller olives in some instances (but soaking it all up with a slice of bread and frying that bread was very good).... #3 double breading is the business works well and is more than well worth it.... \"Myth\" confirmed - delicious particularly with the larger olives.",

I also baked half of them (in the oven at 350 for about 10 mins) & then fried the other half in a pan. The frying was definitely better (like most things are better fried!) but actually the baking was quite good too and is definitely a good healthy alternative. I will make these again although I did think they were going to end up tasting a bit better than they were but still were good. Just a side note: They are really \"olive-y\"...so make sure whoever eats them like olives. I make other olive balls (with green olives) that even my friend who hates olives loves & she always asks me to make them - these would be too strong for her I think...however I love green olives so they were good for me!",

After spending so much time trying to stuff the olives I realized it would have been much easier to purchase pre-stuffed olives with cheese and just add a tab of tabasco. The breading was also a bit tricky. It seemed to easily fall off the olive when frying and if you fry them right out of the freezer then the outside heats much faster than the inside. It might be better to flash fry and then bake so the cheese can melt without the breading burning.",
