I made the sauce separately, including the tomatoes, separated 2 cups of sauce to which I added 1 cup cooked rice and that was enough to fill 4 big peppers. I had about 3 cups of sauce left, without rice, which would be more than enough for 1 lb. pasta. I also used homemade tomato sauce. In any case the recipe is very good tasting and will definitely make again",

I didn't add any tomatoes/Red Sauce to my pepper as I do not like tomatoes. But I added Classico Spicy Mariana (spaghetti sauce) to the other pepper. (My bf loves spicy.)\n\nOven - 350 degrees - 50 minutes (only 2 peppers)\n\nI have completed this easy recipe as it turned out good. I could have added more seasoning to it, but I didn't want to over do it. I followed Jane\u2019s recipe by following on how to prepare the meat and peppers and how long to cook the peppers for.",
