My biggest shocker was the 5 kilo daikon. It was like a cricket bat! Needless to say, I struggle to use up all that daikon weekly and I frequently give it away to Japanese friends. \n\nNot anymore. This recipe is fabulous. EVERYONE, including the picky 6 year old, LOVED this recipe. I have made it twice now, served as a side dish, but I can see making it on a large scale for party nibbles. \n\nThe only change I was forced to make was the sriracha - the only thing I had on hand was Thai chili sauce, which worked very well and added a nice tang. I was generous with it - probably more like a tablespoon, as it was sweet chili sauce. I also fried the cakes in just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan - not near as much as the recipe called for.\n\nSeriously, if you have daikon in the house, make this. This recipe will change your opinion of daikon - it has changed mine - I now look forward to the daikon rather than dread them.",

I also used Egg  Beaters, instead of eggs to further reduce calories.  My 4 star rating is based on the seasonings... I think they could be improved.  Next time, I plan to try Old Bay seasoning, with plain bread crumbs (Panko), instead of the Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Overall, I really enjoyed these and will definitely try them again.  Perhaps, I'll someday try adding diced Chinese sausage, as with the more traditional recipes.",

The only change I made other than that was added some crunched up crackers in addition to the bread crumbs because my mixture was too wet and I wanted it to have a little extra crunch to it. This was delicious! I made a very similar recipe for zucchini patties a few months ago but honestly I liked this one better. I might try to make this with radishes next but just in case anyone is curious it does work great with turnips.",
