Absolutely divine we're about to go and eat it but I've been sneaking bites. Oh and I used fresh picked field mushrooms as well about 4 cups worth as they cook down to be quite small.",

I used already cut up stew meat instead of chuck roast fresh mushrooms instead of dried and farro (much like barley) instead of barley. I made the substitutions because that's what I had on hand - I was looking for a recipe to use the mushrooms and beef I already had. Glad I found this:) I boiled the stew meat and skimmed off the foam as directed. After skimming I added the farro (barley) and cooked it with the beef (no pre-soaking) at a slow boil for about 20 minutes until al dente. I then added the quartered mushrooms and seasonings to the pot and reduced to a simmer. I cooked until the meat was very tender in about 2 1/2 hrs. It was very filling with some nice rustic crusty bread. Also ridiculously easy using meat already cut up and quick cooking barley. I only needed to chop the mushrooms and herbs and cooked everything in one pot so cleanup was a snap too. A winner at my house!",
