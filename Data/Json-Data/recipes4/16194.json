I made this recipe using Bisquick mix and substituting additional white chocolate chips for the pecans to make them more toddler friendly. When I initially mixed the batter I used the 1/2 cup water called for and the batter was very thick. So I added additional water as suggested about 3-4 tablespoons. It was still pretty thick but I thought maybe that was how it was supposed to be. However when I cooked the first ones I knew the thickness was a bad thing as I had heavy cakes that were done on the outside and raw in the middle. So I mixed in more and more water until the consistency was better which ended up being more than 1 cup of extra water (1.5 - 2 cups total). After all that extra mixing the pancakes were pretty tough although the flavor was divine. I feel that the recipe should start with at least 1 cup of water and then add more as needed. I will make these often and will add more water to start with and reduce the amount of mixing I had to do this time.",
