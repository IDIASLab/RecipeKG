The cheese sauce is a little different depending on where you stop to eat, seems everyone has their own way of making it. But we love them all. If you only use one slice of bread and one hamburger patty it is called a ponyshoe. This recipe can also be made with chicken tenders in place of the hamburger patties.",

Add 1 1/2 cups water, pound of velveeta chopped, and to thicken sauce dissolve Tbsp cornstarch in cold water and add to sauce. With this sauce if you have any leftover its good as a dip for chips. ",

I used cayenne instead of hot sauce because I prefer its kind of heat and I added a splash of worchestershire sauce. Also I mixed some garlic powder Lawry's season salt and pepper in with the meat because I don't like the taste of plain unseasoned ground beef. That's just personal preference and no reflection on the recipe. My husband refused to let me put his french fries on top of his meat so I served them on the side. But we did pour the cheese sauce all over everything. This was very filling and good. I'll be making this cheese sauce for other things as well.",
