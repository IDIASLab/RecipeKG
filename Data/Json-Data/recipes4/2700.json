I just put it on the grill with some foil underneath spayed with a little cooking spray to keep it from sticking. I used a whole salmon filet and besides not using the plank I followed the recipe exactly. It came out great. Even my husband enjoyed it and he doesn't care for fish. My daughter asked me to make it this July 4th but I couldn't remember where the recipe came from. I so glad I found it again!!! This time I'll will use the plank.",

I eat salmon a lot especially when eating out and this is right up there with the best I ever had. I had to bake it since it was raining that day but it was still excellent. Also I marinated the salmon for a few hours in the sun-dried tomatoes and dressing. I bought an untreated cedar board from Lowes for 5 and they cut it into eight 1ft planks for me. I soaked the planks over night coated them with oil and let them warm with the oven. I think that the warmer the planks get the better. This was a big hit and is my new favorite salmon recipe can't wait to make it on the grill!",

There's absolutely no need to brush the cedar planks w/ the olive oil further there's really no need to even brush the salmon w/ the olive oil especially b/c the salad dressing will have oil in it. Try to avoid oil packed sun dried tomatoes and go w/ regular sun dried tomatoes that are loose packed. This will turn the salmon into a much healthier dish.",
