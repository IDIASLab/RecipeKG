It was a night for Spanish tapas, so I used manchego cheese instead of parmesan (slightly softer and larger chunks when grated).  The recipes I found here and elsewhere didn't mention how thick to leave the cheese when putting it on the cookie sheet. However...after spooning it out, it was pretty obvious. I did one alone on a sheet as a test and that turned out to be an important step, since I changed my technique when I did the real ones. (Plus the chef needs a snack, right?)  I did three at a time on the cookie sheet. Because manchego is a softer cheese, there was more oil/moisture on the sheet and I didn't want a mess in the oven. They needed 8-10 minutes to get browned and crispy. They were quite soft and shapable when I took them out of the oven, but I put them on parchment paper on a cookie rack to cool. Once they were firm enough to pick up by hand, I removed the paper so they would dry out completely.  Delicious, crispy, and a great addition to the salad!!",

I thought a 2\" circle sounded kind of small. So I used a piece of parchment and drew circles with a large coffee cup that was 3 1/2 inches. I flipped it over and spread the parmesan in the circles. Mine were kind of big so they had to bake 8 minutes to get lightly browned. Once out of the oven I cooled for about 3 or 4 minutes or until they would loosen from the parchment. I then draped them over empty plastic fruit/applesauce cups I had saved. They held there shape nicely once they cooled. I thought a filling might be good for an oderb. But I made mine kind of big so they might work for something like a dip.",

The flavors blend very well and they look like freckles.  I make mine tiny - 1 inch - when I want to serve them flat for scooping vegetable dips like eggplant caviar.  Raw sesame seeds sprinkled before baking blend very well too.  Don't use toasted sesame - it will burn and will affect the taste.  Thanks for posting the basket version. I had never thought of it.",
