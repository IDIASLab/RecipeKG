Be sure not to cook your sweet potatoes too long in the microwave or they will be mushy when you cut them and won't grill as well. Cook just till just barely fork tender and then slice them up. It didn't say to peel them first but I did. If you are cooking something else on your grill it would be hard to make these for a large family unless you have a huge grill. I served with Kickin' Turkey Burgers with Carmelized Onions from this site and we dipped them into the sauce recipe for the burgers.",

(He had opted for a tiny taste-and-see portion on the first round.) I adjusted serving size to 2 and used a farily large sweet potato. I ended up using about four minutes on high in our microwave for the pre-cook phase. Meanwhile I mixed the spices vinegar and oil in a zip lock bag; later placing the \"fingers\" of par-baked potato into the bag for a shake-to-coat application ahead of grilling the requisite time. This was easy and was a nice alternative to butter and cinnamon. We will do again. (This time we served with a spinach salad and grilled steaks.)",
