I also added mushrooms, sprinkled in a little granulated garlic,  and a dash of ground ginger.  We are huge fans of Jasmine rice, and when I saw that Uncle Ben's had it available in the microwavable pouches I couldn't resist using it in place of the brown rice.  The basic recipe is good and I love that it incorporates a wonderfully colorful array of veggies. It is also easy and quick for a busy week night. I think had it had a little more seasoning in the original recipe and not used the brown rice which is kind of nutty in flavor, I would have given this 5 stars. Definitely will make this again! Fun to explore all the options.",

I tried it again, this time with a fresh bottle. It stunk too, so it became apparent that this is how the stuff is meant to be. I tried not to be influenced by the way it smelled when I tasted the finished dish. I got past the offensive smell ok, but was still unimpressed, so I vowed never to try it again\u2013until I read an article about what ingredients professional chefs could not do without and one said \u201cRed Boat Fish Sauce.\u201d  I then was on a mission to find this and to give fish sauce another try. This, coupled with a conversation I had with a Vietnamese friend made me look forward to it. (She also confirmed for me something else I learned \u2013 that Three Crabs Fish Sauce was also considered among the best and this is what she uses. She also said that when they use fish sauce as a dipping sauce they dilute it with water, sweeten it with sugar and add a little fresh lemon juice, all of which get rid of the fish stink) I wanted a simple recipe, so I tried this one.  I thought it was ok. Hubs surprisingly, liked it better than I did.  He liked the combination of ingredients (I added sliced mushrooms and garlic) but he did add that he found it a tad bland.  I did not use the ready brown rice called for, choosing white rice instead.  Most important, I liked it well enough that I have now purchased three cookbooks on Vietnamese cooking!",

Leftovers make excellent lunches for the next day because the rice doesn't get mushy. Thank you for the recipe.",
