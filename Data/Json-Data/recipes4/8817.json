I didn't have black beans so used half a can of 'mixed beans'. Didn't have arugula but added fresh cilantro instead. Also added corn kernals and cumin (because I like it). Only down side is that some of them were a little messy to move without the filling falling out. But good recipe. Loved the mango in it for something different!",
