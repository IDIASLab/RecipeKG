I also use corn flakes instead of bread crumbs. Also, I add about 1/2 of an onion, diced.  Awesome!  A great compliment to ham. I always make this for Easter.  Good for potlucks too!",

I thought the sauce and topping were about twice what you would need for 2 pounds of potatoes so I added another half of a bag of potatoes. It looked great with its lightly browned bread crumb topping but only about 3 people besides me dared to eat it. Maybe they just weren't hungry. My advice is to decrease the sauce and topping ingredients rather than increase the potatoes because it makes a huge amount. With all the processed ingredients it will probably never spoil but I decided to throw it away after a week as one serving was enough for me. I think I'll try a funeral pie next time.",

(I know!! 4lbs!!) but followed the recipe to the letter - except I just added the amt of breadcrumbs I felt \"looked right.\" I was feeding a crowd that night and I didn't have ANY LEFT! But I made them a second time (again using the 4lb bag of square hashbrowns) but this time I used a 15.5oz jar of cheese chili con carne. This type of mexican cheese gave them a zippy kick. We loved it this way too (almost better!!). Yes it makes a lot (we had leftovers) BUT I can't figure out how you can halve the sauce portion w/out wasting some of the \"cream of...\" soups! With the changes I made this was awesome and loved by everyone! Thanks nancy!",
