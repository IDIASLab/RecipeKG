It should be something like Vegetables of the Lost World soup or Chupacabra soup in honor of that strange k named vegetable. Haven't tasted it yet and I will be back to weigh in on that. It's done and it's fab! Everyone warned me oh those turnips will be bitter.... nope! They taste good. And so does that K vegetable. It is a bit bland but I figure a person can add to taste things like pepper or cheese. Thanks for the great recipe.",
