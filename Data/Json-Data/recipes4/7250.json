Am giving this recipe a four star but only because it's much more complicated than need be. You can simply place all the internal ingredients on one entire tortilla, top with the other tortilla (butter side up) then when time to turn just slide on to the plate you already planned to slice the quesadillas on, turn the skillet upside down over the plate and flip the plate and pan over to slide it back in the skillet and continue cooking the other side. Oh, and using sliced jalapenos from a jar saves the step of broiling the fresh jalapenos should you like to choose ;-)",

I used two whole tortillas stacked on top of each other and cooked it on a baking sheet at 425 for about 7 minutes per side and it was perfectly browned and melty.  Added salsa and sliced avocado on top - the whole roasted jalapenos are quite spicy with the membranes and seeds left in, but so worth the extra effort of roasting and peeling.  Had leftover wedge the next morning with a fried egg on top and more salsa.  I almost think I prefer the breakfast version!",

The usual changes I make are that I use jarred pre sliced jalapenos, because it's faster and I don't have to bake any that way. And instead of using the crushed regular tortilla chips, I'll use Doritos, when and if I have them on hand. Otherwise I'll just skip that (optional) step. As a filling I've also added chicken and mushrooms, and they were delicious that way as well! Oh I've also added sliced yellow, red and orange mini bell peppers that I previously sauteed in a frying pan :) The options are endless!!",

I loved the idea that someone offered about using these for breakfast with an egg or two, all the more reason to freeze dry a big batch of jalape\u00f1o peppers and just grab a handful as needed.",

However I bought some jalapeno peppers from the fresh market near our home and they were the hottest jalapenos I have ever eaten. I love them because when removing the membranes and seeds they are always great on flavor and kick. But these were so hot the quesadillas were too hot to eat and burned your mouth lips and throat for 20 minutes after. Now I'm not a sissy when it comes to hot stuff. We use Siracha on almost everything. But these were hotter than habaneros or any other chili I have ever used. I will try the recipe again and I know the heat of the peppers has nothing to do with the recipe; I just wanted to share our hot pepper experience. Thank you for the recipe. Debbie",

Learned a few things: I started with whole wheat tortilla and a non stick pan but it didn't work well. Switched to flour tortilla and the grill pan and it worked brilliantly. Because of the size of my grill pan Deeli's suggestion of using two stacked tortillas instead of one folded one did not work quite as well. I split the jalapenos and scraped out the seeds and membrane with my fingertip. I had a little eczema or something between a couple of my fingers on both hands. And then they started burning.... burning.... burning..... I tried a few tricks and they worked - in this order: washed hands with oil-dissolving dish detergent - that didn't work too well then I did a thick paste of water and baking soda which I left on to let dry - may be a bit better. Then I rubbed a tablespoon of olive oil between my fingers for about 3 minutes - this really seemed to do the trick. I know it was stupid - next time I'm heeding the warning and wearing gloves. This is a great recipe easily tailored to individual tastes.",
