I then add a 28oz can of diced tomatoes & 1 8oz can of tomato sauce..sit on low for an hou & the serve over rice. DELICIOUS!",

I also cut the recipe in half because it makes a lot of food. Next time I will cut it in 1/4 as I am just cooking for me and my husband. Served with some Indian panera bread. Delicious!",
