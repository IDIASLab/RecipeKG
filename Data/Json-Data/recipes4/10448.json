What's great about this recipe is how much you can adapt the recipe.  I like to make these peppers the night after making a stir fry, to use up extra cooked rice.  I have also stuffed the peppers with leftover risotto from the previous night's dinner.  I find the salt in the feta is plenty, so I don't add any extra.  These are great to use up any vegetables you have on hand (I have thrown in corn, broccoli, mushrooms, etc.), and I love to use fresh basil in these.  Also, regular onions are fine if you don't have green onions on hand.",

Let that sautee for 15 min also adding in cut up pieces of zucchini, brocolli, carrot, and 2 tomatoes.  Added the feta and stuffed my pepps with this and topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese and cooked for the extra five minutes.

I coated them lightly with olive oil and sprinkled them with sea salt and freshly ground pepper before roasting them for just 20 minutes, which was perfect. I cooked the arborio rice in chicken broth and a little butter, and added fresh minced garlic to the sauteed onions and herbs.  Once mixed altogether with the chopped tomatoes, it looked like it could use a little color, so I threw in a handful of fresh, minced parsley. As for the feta, since hubs can't stand it I subbed some freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano instead (which he also doesn't like, but so be it). At this point I just put them back in the turned off oven until I got the rest of dinner plated and it worked out well. To finish, I gave them a light sprinkle of truffle sea salt. While not a masterpiece, it still was a healthy, tasty and pretty alternative to the routine vegetable/starch side dishes.",

I also used a can of diced tomatoes, drained, in replace of the fresh tomato, which I also did not have at the time.

I will use an extra tomato next time since it turned out a little dry and I like mine a little more \"saucy\" I've come back to edit this with more essential changes: one small can diced tomatoes two fresh tomatoes handful of mozzarella frozen corn. Also the pepper only need about 20 min roasting time and stand them upright... I had mine upside down and they wilted and it was a pain to fill them. This is GOOD and the way I make it can stuff over half a dozen peppers!",
