I didn't have an jalapeno pepper ~ but did have a small can of green chilies, we don't like bell peppers, and never use processed American Cheese (is that unAmerican??)  So I followed the recipe without the bell pepper, and used 1/2 a pound of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  Then, upon serving, my husband and I garnished our bowls of soup with our desired amount of green chilies.  That way our young daughters who do not have a palate for spicy didn't have to have it.  Both girls loved it without the chilies, and my husband and I loved it with the chilies.",

Also, I usually crumble a few pieces of bacon on top to give it a bit more of a smoky flavor and my husbnad loves it. I use the low fat velveeta cheese and it makes the soup rich and creamy without all the added calories. So, if you want to try something different but awesome, then this is the soup for you. One more thing, you can increase or decrease the heat by adding or subtracting anywhere from 1/4t to 1t of cayenne pepper. I hope this helps, enjoy!",

I also make rivvels (i.e. dumplings) and have even made some amish noodles, boiled separately and added to the soup. \n\n\nMy husband, who loves to jokingly complain, \"I worked all day for SOUP?!\" will ALWAYS say it's the best soup he's ever had -- and go back for more. :)",
