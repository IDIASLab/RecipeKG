I wasn't quite sure what was meant on the cereal & brown sugar thing so I just used Cap'n Crunch. The sauce: I tasted it after mixing & was a little sweet so I added more hot sauce to balance it out (just my preference). I also baked once as directed & then poured more sauce on them & baked again for 10 more minutes. These are quite messy so you will need a wet finger towel at the table. You also need more oil for frying them.",

                "reviewBody": "This was amazing although I tweaked it a bit. I used flour panko bread crumbs and crushed garlic butter flavored croutons instead of flour and cereal. I did not add anything to the Franks red hot sauce except the 3/4 cup butter. I used a 4 lb bag of frozen drummettes (thawed rinsed and dried with paper towels. The egg mixture was adequate so no need to increase. I recommend increasing the flour mixture and the sauce mixture to double or at least 1-1/2. I fried in a four cup mixture of canola oil and sesame oil. I cooked in large skillet of oil for 30 minutes turning at 15 minutes. Tip: use left hand to dip in egg and drop in flour mixture then use right hand to coat with flour and place in hot oil. It cuts way down on the mess. Tasted better than any restaurant. My husband was ecstatic. Will make again for sure!!",
