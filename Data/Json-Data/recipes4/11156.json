So I skipped the butter and browned the ground beef with onions, twice the garlic, and some chopped green pepper.  I didn't have mushrooms, so I added corn instead, plus a healthy amount of oregano, salt, and pepper.  I covered the skillet with cheddar right before serving, and it came out great.  Even my three-year-old ate it without any complaints.  We will definitely be doing this again.",

You can add corn or green chiles or whatever.  Top it with cheddar and you're golden.  Easy.  Yummy. Serve tortilla chips on the side.",

I didn't have fresh garlic on hand, so I used garlic powder instead to simmer with the onions in butter.  Next, I added the ground beef, chopped green/red peppers, a can of mushrooms, some peperoni slices, the cooked rice, 2 cans of tomato soup (I didn't have tomato sauce on hand either), and some water.  For seasonings, I added cumin, cajun seasoning, black pepper, salt, oregano, and italian seasoning. After simmering for a while, I added mozerella cheese instead of the cheddar (which was suggested by a previous reviewer). It was really delightful and my family of 6 really enjoyed it--there were no leftovers!!  Thanks to M.Bolt for sending this recipe in!",
