I have been craving the red beans and rice I remember from this period, and this recipe totally hit the spot, I am so pleased. I didn't puree anything, just kept everything at a fine chop. I used smoked sausage instead of ham, yellow squash instead of pumpkin (even though I really wanted pumpkin - it's what I remember), and I had to use two packets of Sazon Goya instead of the annatto or achiote powder (I am going to keep trying to find these). It was SO GOOD, and had the exact flavor I remember and love. Next time I make it I am going to use more liquid, my husband wanted more \"juice\" for his rice. I thought it was perfect as is. Excellent, excellent recipe!",

I prefer my meat:vegetable ratio to lean a bit more to the vegi side so I used a large onion large green pepper 9 cloves of garlic (I love garlic) a half bunch of cilantro (I love garlic almost as much as I love cilantro) and 3 potatoes. I didn't have any fresh pumpkin so I doubled the potatoes... I actually think the pumpkin would taste great too. I also used my own seasoning rather than the annatto powder which I didn't have. Go with your gut on that. Finally I squeezed half a lime and added a dash of Sherry wine into the processor mix. I followed the other ingrediants and preparation method as prescribed. Result? Very good. I was impressed with the variety of flavors without the cilantro or garlic taking over. (now to others that might be too much so use according to taste) Makes a great side dish.

I loved the recipe but did not like using canned beans when dry beans taste better are cheaper and so easy to make. Besides I'm Cuban and my mother would disown me if I used canned beans. That's like an Italian serving canned spaghettios for a special occasion. It's just not done. I soak a bag of red beans according to package directions. I've used small and kidney beans. I use the smallest bag size (1 pound I believe). I soak according to directions with only 1 variation. I only drain 1/2 of the soaking water and replace the water I removed with fresh water. I don't puree anything. I brown the meat onions and green pepper then put in all the ingredients except the potatoes. Cooked the beans according to package directions and put the potatoes in at the end so that they wouldn't get mushy. Used butternut squash. No pumpkin available. Keeping with Cuban tradition I had to add 6 slices of bacon cooked and chopped along with 2T of the bacon renderings. I also added 3 or 4 thumb size spanish chorizo sausage (NOT MEXICAN CHORIZO please). I peeled off the sausage casing and diced the sausage. I use exactly 8 packets of Sazon Goya instead of achiote powder. I used Sazon Goya's achiote version one time and the saffron flavor the 2nd. Both good. Since there are more beans than in the one can used in original recipe I tripled up on the amount of veggies and meat. However I only used one large green pepper.",
