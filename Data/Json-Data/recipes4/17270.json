I topped with Andes' peppermint crunch mints (white with pink top and red bottom). I was a little leary while spreading them but I just worked at it for few minutes using a small off-set spatula helped. The 'frosting' layer was pinkish in color. Right away I topped with holiday-colored jimmies. I cut these into very small squares (they're rich) at about 2 hours. I didn't want to wait the four hours as I was afraid they might be hard to get out. They look so festive! Plan to bring tomorrow for a volunteer mailing that I'm doing.",
