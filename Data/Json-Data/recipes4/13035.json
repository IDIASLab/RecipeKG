I thought I'd give my favorite recipe site a try and see what I could come up with.  Boy am I glad I did!  I didn't think this bread would go well with ham & beans, but the rave reviews really intrigued me.  I can't believe a handfull of such simple ingredients can taste so good just because they're fried.  Some crumbled the bread into their bowl of soup, some ate them with butter.  One even put a little jam on part of one.  Delicious all the way around and everyone loved them.  I even got a \"thumbs up\" from my super-finicky 9-yr-old.  Now, THAT'S good! ",
