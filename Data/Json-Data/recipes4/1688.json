I used Mexicorn, and instead of the Miracle Whip, I used just over 1/2 cup of  fat free sour cream instead. I also used a packet of taco seasoning rather than the chili powder. In my pantry, there were some refried black beans I wanted to get rid of, and I figured this would be a good way to do that. Boy, was I right! I layered it on top of the beef mixture in my 9x13. For the crushed chips, I used Fritos rather than tortilla chips, and last but not least, I used 2 cups of Mexican cheeses rather than just Colby. In essence, I guess I changed almost everything about the recipe. LOL! But it was DELICOIUS! Ally",

Then I replaced chili powder with 2 tbsp. of taco seasoning.  I also reduced the salsa to 1 cup & added 1 can of black beans in with the corn.  Instead of 3/4 mayo I used 1/2 cup of sour cream & 1 heaping tbsp. of mayo.  Once complete, this was really easy to make and so good!  I totally loved it!  My husband said it tasted like Nachos Grande.  It's also is a good recipe if you have broken up pieces of nacho chips left at the end of a bag.  I found the smaller more crumbled up pieces filled it in great.\nThanks for the new recipe!  ",
