The third asked for no beans and shrimp which was easy to filter out in his bowl.  Husband devoured it and wished it had more shrimp. Overall a success considering it was a week out from daily doses of Easter ham. Serve by itself or over white rice.",

The 1st time was as written, the 2nd time was with a chunk of pork butt roast, and tonight I used 7 boneless skinless chicken thighs, chicken bullion, 1 can stewed tomatoes, 1 can crushed tomato, and 1 cup dried black beans.  Cooked this in crock pot on high for 7 hours. I was trying to make something like a gumbo with what I had on hand and by just dumping everything into pot and walking away.  The experiment turned out very well but next time I would add shrimp, add more beans but soak overnight or at least boil 20-30 minutes prior to adding to pot.  The point I am trying to make is that this recipe is very versatile and many other things can be substituted for ham bone (I usually don't have one on hand), and it will still turn out great.  Oh,and use whole can of coconut milk.  Thanks for the great base recipe and I never would have thought to add the coconut milk but it really makes this dish!  Next time I will use some venison or caribou.",
