It helps to negate the acidic bite of the tomatoes and lets the other flavors come through\n\nI only had time to let it simmer for 2 hours and it was still amazing!",

I browned the hamburger in a huge pasta pot and then drained it, leaving a little fat in the pan and setting the meat aside.  Then, I softened the celery and onion slowly (for 10 minutes).  Then I added the rest of the ingredients.  All in one pan!  If you don't like CHUNKY sauce, use diced tomatoes, not whole.  Also, I stir/mash with a potato ricer, not a spoon.  Either way, if you simmer all day, it shouldn't be that chunky (tomato sauce tastes like ketchup, eww).  Last, it DOES need sweetness -- I add a tsp. of sugar 15 minutes before serving -- you should taste and do it to your preference.  These sound like big changes, but they're not -- and well worth it, if you're going to do this all day.  Looking forward to posting my own private recipe soon.",

I left out the celery and peppers (at my husband's request) and added red wine (at my father's request) and served it up. Everyone raved about it and they are a diverse and picky group.

This time I used fresh tomatoes out of my garden because it's that time of year (guess I used about 10 med. size) plus I cut back on the Italian seasoning & only used about 1 1/2 Tbsp. & it was just right not overpowering. Also used only 2 bay leaves. With any spaghetti sauce (even the jar stuff) I always add about 2 Tbsp. of brown sugar as it takes the \"bite\" out of the tomatoes from the acid in them. My sister-in-law told me about this years ago & I've been doing it ever since. Thanks for a great recipe Lana!",

My only changes (after reading other reviews) I didn't do all the steps. I just cooked the ground beef, onion, celery, etc. Just made it a one pot deal. I used really lean ground beef so there was no need to drain. I didn't have time to cook it for 6 hours, but it was fantastic just the way it was after 3 hours. Besides I don't like my ground beef cook to a mealy consistancy anyway.  I didn't change the seasonings at all. I love bay and I love my sauce to taste like something other than tomato. I did add a tablespoon of sugar, because I like my sauce to have a 'balanced' flavor. I was surprised the recipe didn't call for salt or pepper. I didn't add it and it didn't need it.  Happy cooking!  Laura Behrendt",

Since so many reviews mentioned how chunky it was I took the suggestion of another review and swapped one can of tomatoes for a can of tomato sauce. Turned out perfect. Next time I will make a double or triple batch for some to freeze.",
