This recipe is much lighter having less cheese then the others I've made.  My husband even said, \"D, this was a great breakfast\"! now I was happy to get that compliment.

I frequently make egg bake type dishes with different vegis spinach and green chilies are some of them but have never thought of doing them together. I will make this again. Oh I didn't add any butter but did put a tablespoon or two (just a couple dribbles) to give it a buttery taste. It's not greasy and you probably could completely omit the butter and never notice.",

First I cooked some chopped bacon (because I add bacon to almost everything). Then I cooked some thinly sliced leeks in about a teaspoon of the bacon grease and used those instead of the green chilies. I melted the buttter in the pan and wilted some fresh swiss chard in it then used that in place of the spinach. I kept everything else the same and the quiche was absolutely delicious. It wasn't quite as creamy as traditional quiche--it was a little more \"firm\"-- but considering that the egg/cottage cheese/less cheese combo makes it healthier it was fabulous!",
