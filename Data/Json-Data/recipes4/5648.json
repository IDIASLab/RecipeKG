Browned both sides lowered the flame covered it when almost cooked I poured 1 tbls of sauce and covered again. Fish remained seared and not soggy. I roasted flaked coconut w a pinch of raw sugar in a little butter then added the cilantro/green onion topping.

It definitely needed some salt and no skimping on the ginger--needs all of it for the right flavor. I think the lemongrass & thai basil other reviewers used would've really made this even more delicious. We all liked it enough to make it again but will probably keep playing with it. Other big change I did to make it easier was to just cook the fish in the coconut sauce. It was very moist & flavorful & made this dish even easier to make.",
