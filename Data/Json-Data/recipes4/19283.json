I love onions but one chopped onion divided was plenty (probably even too much for most people) for 1 cup of rice. Tonight was the first night I had ever added bacon to Spanish rice. I actually made two different rice recipes that called for it so it must be more common that I would have thought. I'll be adding it every chance I get now. It was really good. I also liked the fact that this recipe incorporated the rice and beans all into one. The recipe didn't say to do so but I recommend draining your beans. Great recipe!",
