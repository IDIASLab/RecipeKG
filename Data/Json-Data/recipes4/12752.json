It is also a good filling meal that won't leave you hungry after a few hours. The cons: first this takes a lot of attention because as the beans get softer they begin to mush and stick on the bottom of the pan (it's a nice consistency when it's finished but you have to stir every 10-15 minutes for the last 2-3 hours). Second this is LOADED with fat. And third it is quite costly. The taste was pretty good and it is an interesting dish but not worth the time.",
