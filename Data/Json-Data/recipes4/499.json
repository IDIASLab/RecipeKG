Our favorite is to sautee ham, asparagus and onion and put that right on top of the swiss cheese.  Another favorite is to use one package of frozen chopped spinach thawed and squeezed dry from all it's water and spread out on top of the swiss cheese.  The recipe recommends freezing this and cooking it later, but I have been making it and then baking it right away.  350 for one hour seems to be the best cooking time and temp!  I have never added the pimento or parsley for garnish.  Also, I probably add a little bit more than 1 1/2 cups swiss cheese and I always use cream instead of milk!  I have actually been told by more than one person that this is the best quiche that they have ever had - how is that for a compliment :)",

I made 10 quiches (so easy...only trading Cheddar for Swiss) and they froze beautifully! I loved being able to pull my quiche out of the freezer and stick it straight into the oven, no thawing mess! Very delicious flavor and the feedback from my meal exchange ladies was awesome! They all insisted on having the recipe! Have made it for brunches and potlucks since then and mixed up the ingredients using bacan or sausage and various cheeses and veggies. This is a very good base recipe!! Have fun with it.

Different combos: ham and onion/ spinach, meat lovers,  turkey bacon and asparagus/tomato- different combos of cheese based on what I have in the fridge.  I also use some 1/2 and 1/2 mixed with the milk.  I add real dijon mustard, tarragon and a spoon of horseradish to make the flavors pop.  If using onions, saute in a tbsp. of olive oil until soft.  Add any veggies to the onions to soften.\nA trick for quiche is to bake the crust for 5 minutes while the oven is preheating so it does not get soggy.  One last thing- to avoid a spill/mess- par-bake crust.   Put cheese/flour mixture into crust.  Add veggies and meat, and open the oven.  Pull out shelf. Put the pie pan onto oven rack and THEN POUR EGG MIXTURE IN!!  Was taught this trick years ago at a restaurant I worked at.",

I'd recommend using a crust because the cheese on the crustless one got overcooked whereas the one with the crust came out perfectly. Homemade crust is definitely the way to go as the butter compliments the flavor of the quiche (also no transfat). I added broccoli paprika and fresh ground pepper. Instead of swiss I used a reduced fat blend of cheeses (Montrey Jack cheddar mozz & colby). I also used part half & half and part milk. I used 1 egg and 1/2 C egg substitute to cut down on the cholesterol fat and calories. Great recipe!",
