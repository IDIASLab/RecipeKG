Good amount of veggie to meat ratio (we like a lot of veggies / beans mixed in) and some heat from the peppers but not too much (I'm a spice wimp!) We fixed ours like we would any other taco - avocado cheese sour cream lettuce tomato etc. Yumm!",

I cooked the ground beef - drained the grease and then added taco seasoning and the 1/4 cup of water. Cooked that down a bit and then added the bag Birds Eye Recipe Ready Southwest Blend - which is Corn Black Beans Green poblano peppers red peppers onions. For us this would lead itself to taco salad or burritos rather than tacos. It does manage to stretch 1 lb of ground beef a long way - it made a lot more than I thought it would.
