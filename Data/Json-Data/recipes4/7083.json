                "reviewBody": "The meatballs had a really good flavor however the sauce really needs some sugar. The cheese kind of gets lost not sure I would use in these next time. The sauce was tangy and very tart. With some sugar I think it would make a world of difference. The maple syrup didn't add enough sweetness. I wish I had of tasted the sauce before I poured it over the meatballs. I would like to try these again but sweeten the sauce up a bit for a more tangy sweet balance. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Thanks for sharing.",
