I used mostly red yellow and orange peppers with just a little green pepper for color. We had enough leftovers (for the 2 of us) for dinner tonight!

The lack of salt may have contributed to the bland taste of these potatoes I think the beer could be cut in half and chicken stock could add a little more depth of flavor. Tried to rescue the potatoes as leftovers by frying them and adding salt and seasoning but I still couldn't get over the BEER taste.
