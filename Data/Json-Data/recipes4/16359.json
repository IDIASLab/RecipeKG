I halved the recipe and used an immersion blender (instead of a blender) which emulsified the soup to a creamy texture.  Very nice and a little decadent :-)",

No way this takes only 15 minutes of prep time. I had to use 6 boxes of fresh mushroom, which took what seemed forever to clean and slice (sliced mushrooms not available where I live.) Next time I will buy the largest mushrooms I can find to cut down on the prep time substantially. I don't know how Chef John got his mushrooms carmelized in just 15 minutes; it took mine a lot, lot longer, but they are wonderful when done. The only thing I did at the end was add more stock. The soup came out thick as mud, and while I like very thick soups, this was beyond thick. The flavor is absolutely delicious. If you love mushrooms and want to feel like a professional chef, make this soup. Outstanding recipe, Chef John!",

I think the secret is the roux and cooking the mushrooms to a golden brown. This made for a very rich flavor.  Achieving the golden brown only took about 15 minutes as the instructions said.   Based on similar mushroom soup recipes, I think you could cut down the hour simmering time if you are  pushed for time. Next time I will experiment with adding a little more flour to make it slightly thicker and I may add a little Sherry.",

In this case, I accidently tweaked.  \n\nThe mushrooms caramelized for almost an hour because my ADHD self spotted a squirrel or chicken or something and forgot to get back to the pot.  It worked out though. \n\nNo fresh thyme. Went to my herb garden and the squirrel or chicken or something ate the thyme so I used the dry stuff that comes in a jar.  \n\nSome white wine may have fallen out of the bottle I was drinking and into the soup pot.   It happens...\n\nThe last tweak, I admit to doing on purpose.  Black Truffle Oil... just a tiny drizzle.  Amazing, but very little goes a long way.\n\nI tasted as I cooked and before tweaking so I can honestly say the recipe really is perfect exactly as written.",
