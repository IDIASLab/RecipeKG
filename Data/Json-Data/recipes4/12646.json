The most common spice company is McCormick's and they have an inordinate amount of clove in their pickling mix. If you are not sure what is in your mix, clove will be slightly larger than a black peppercorn and float in water. If it is in there, take it out.",

I was certain this was a \"sure thing\" given the simple ingredients and instructions, and the fact that it's about the only recipe I've ever seen with all 5* reviews.    I made these are Thursday, and I followed the measurements & instructions EXACTLY. By the end of the first day, the eggs were all a mottled brown color... very unappetizing.   When I tried one tonight, it was awful.  I've never made pickled eggs before, but when I buy them, they retain a bright white color.  I am so disappointed that 1 dozen eggs were wasted.  Given the spectacular results others have had, I would like to try again.  *Update: Thanks for your feedback, the answer is no, I did not use balsamic vinegar.",

I had a tough time deciding and leaned a little towards these, but most people like the Pennsylvania version better. This was at a party of guests who hadn't had pickled eggs before (same verdict when I made them both for my family). \nThese are delicious, easy, and cheap. My roomate likes to slice them up to add to sandwiches.\nA couple times I've run out of pickling spice and had to make do with just bay leaves, pepper, and cloves. It came out fine.\nI also haven't noticed a difference between leaving them over night and eating them or leaving them for 3 days and eating them. The heat is enough to soak the marinade through the egg white.\nAlso, for those who don't have pickling jars and are using a bowl you should at least double the marinade in order to completely cover the eggs and onions.",

I should have listened to the other reviewer who suggested that... also I am considering adding a little garlic, some red pepper, and some sugar... also I will leave a few more onions uncooked (because I just love them).. but otherwise this recipe seem to work well for me... no troubles at all... they are disappearing fast which is always a good sign...\n\nUPDATE: The last time I made these I made the following changes... used only 1 Tablespoon salt... removed most of the cloves from the pickling spice... added 4 cloves worth of minced garlic.... 1 tablespoon sugar... and 1/8 teaspoon of crushed red pepper... Also I love pickled onions so I layered a few extra slices of raw ones with the eggs.. My family said the liked the changed recipe better... I will stick with my changes next time I make it... I definately like eating the extra onion I added...",

I bought a 1 quart jar but only 10 eggs fit (and even then they were squished to make fit) and only about half the onions and liquid could fit in the jar. The only pickling spice I could find at our grocer was McCormick's and it contains cloves. I pulled out the cloves because people complained they made the eggs brown and over-powered the flavor. I could still taste the cloves in the eggs so I must not have gotten them all or else they infused the rest of the spices. I also added a tablespoon of minced garlic and some mustard seed but I cut out the peppercorns after reading the other reviews. In all I wasn't too pleased with the taste of the pickling spice. It tasted like ginger bread or something. I'd prefer a stronger vinegar and garlic taste. I think I might skip the pickling spice next time and add a dozen garlic cloves instead.",
