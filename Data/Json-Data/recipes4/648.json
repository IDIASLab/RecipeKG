I didn't have processed cheese so I used 3 slices of cheddar and diced them. Cut down a little on the mayo. Added some cracked pepper into the mixture. I omitted the olives (because I'm not into them) but kept the sweet relish and onions but cut down to half an onion coz I thought the one I had was too big. I put the mixture on 4 hotdog buns (there is a lot of mixture but maybe I have small hotdog buns) then I sprinkled paprika and a bit more pepper on top before wrapping in aluminium foil and into the oven. Love it!!! Going to make this again soon.",

My kids have grown up on these and love them. So with these changes is why I gave it 5. Thanks Karen!",
