I marinated 2 pints of cherry tomatoes cut in half with the red onion. I put it all in a bowl and let it set at room temp while we grilled the sausage. It went perfect with the Italian sausage! We didn't have french rolls so we served it with Pasta Hot! Hot! Hot! from this site. I can't wait to try this again but on rolls. This one's a keeper especially over the summer months! Update: Made this again but served it on rolls and OMG it's wonderful! Perfect for a quick and easy meal especially paired with a garden salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing.",
