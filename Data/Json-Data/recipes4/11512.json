The only changes I made were to use ghee instead of oil, jalapeno instead of serrano, and I omitted the asafoetida powder as I can't find it anywhere. I ended up adding a few more cardamon pods (some black, some green) just because I love the flavor. I made it with kidney beans as I love the color, and prefer the texture over the other suggested beans. Thanks so much, Kay!",

I served it as a side with salmon in coconut milk and naan but this superb dish offers rich and complex flavors and deserves to be an entree on its own -- perhaps with saffron rice; or add vegetable broth to make a savory stew. Advice to cooks: If some exotic spices are hard to find try hard to find at least the fennel seeds and especially the cardamom pods (or seeds -- but NOT ground cardamom). One of the best discoveries I've made on AllRecipes.com!",

I was actually looking for a recipe to use up some cabbage and fennel seeds so I almost passed this one by as I did not have some of the other ingredients. I did not have fenugreek seeds or asafoetida powder and used ground cumin and coriander instead of the seeds/pods and yellow ground mustard instead of black mustard seeds. Of course not exactly the same recipe but still a delicious alternative to the average fried cabbage recipes. I opted for the kidney beans which made this a really pretty dish - the green/white cabbage a bit of yellow from the spices and deep red beans. Looking forward to picking up the missing spices and making this one as stated some time!",
