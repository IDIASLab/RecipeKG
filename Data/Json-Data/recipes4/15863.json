He has a very picky palate so I was waiting for him to say something, but no.  Great way to enjoy \"potatoes\" without the carbs!  Oh, I cooked my cauliflower on the stove in chicken bouillon and added garlic powder to taste plus mincef dried onion, a bit of parm cheese and topped my casserole with a little shredded swiss.",

I have to say that if what you re looking for is a healthy version of mashed potatoes this is not it. My boyfriend put so much salt and butter on his to make it taste like something that I probably should have just made the potatoes and spared myself the dirty looks haha.",
