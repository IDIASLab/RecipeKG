Couple swaps as well.\" Unlike the recipe submitter who prefers a wetter golumpki, we want it a little more dry, so I only used 1 15 oz. can of Hunt's tomato sauce; I believe it was an Italian-seasoned one. To save a step, I used a coleslaw-mix produce bag, but added some work back in (lol) by using 1/2 chopped onion instead of onion powder. This is one of those very forgiving, very comforting casseroles that some may call bland, but we just love. Other than it possibly needing garlic (and myself adding Sriracha to my plate), I think it was great. Making it ahead of time and leaving it covered in the oven for a bit longer than the recipe stated (so the cabbage on top didn't char too much) made dinner even easier.",

E.g., I saute a large onion (chopped) in butter, cook the onion separately, then add to cooked hamburger meat and cooked rice.  I use small diced tomatoes instead of crushed, and add chicken broth instead of tomato soup.  I use less water in cooking the rice (in a rice cooker) so it will absorb the liquids (stock and tomatoes) a bit more.  Only use 11/3 cup water to 1 cup rinsed jasmine rice (it's already wet from rinsing).  Also sort of layer the cabbage on bottom and top of the meat/rice mixture in the pan.  This seems to mimic cabbage rolls a bit more when you spoon it out.  Overall, though, way easier than doing old fashioned cabbage rolls and tastes just as good.",
