I gave it 5 stars after making the following changes: used 2c. brown rice (instead of white) and cooked it in vegetable broth instead of water, increased the parmesan cheese to 3/4 c., increased the shredded cheddar to about 5 oz, increased the eggs to 4.  I also followed other reader's advice and sauteed the zucchini with 1/2 c. margerine (omitted the oil) and about 1 T. of minced garlic instead of steaming it.  I also added about 1 c. of diced carrots to the saute for color and extra vitamins.  I topped it with 3/4 c. crushed Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and baked it at 350 degrees for about 50 minutes and did not broil it at all.  It came out delicious and my whole family loved it.  Next time I will probably top it with some cheese, as well as the cracker crumbs.",

Continue the recipe as written but omitted the bread crumbs to cut down on the carbs. Placed in a greased casserole dish and microwaved until hot--delicious! I was concerned about the number of people it said that it served but I found that it really served 6-8 nicely.",

I also cooked two cups of rice as suggested by others which made the amount of cheese used need to be at least doubled. When stirring zuke into oil and butter I added a tablespoon of minced garlic. I used panko bread crumbs on top and would use more next time so it was a coating over the top. I sprinkle the bread crumbs with cheese to give a nicer look. This made a large serving and would be great for a dish to pass dinner or a big family. The next time I would try to think of something to give it a bit more zip maybe trying a nacho cheese. But it definitely is a great idea for all that zuchinni!!!",

I did make some alterations: used chicken broth instead of water for the rice used 1 cup dry rice and added some garlic powder at the end before baking it. I'm pretty sure I used a lot more cheddar too I just eyeballed it. However I thought I used too much rice so next time I'll try 3/4 cup and see how it goes. Also the bread crumbs browned up before the casserole got bubbly so I put tin-foil on top. I think 1 cup of breadcrumbs was too much I'll try a little less next time. This is a definite favorite and I'll be making it again!",
