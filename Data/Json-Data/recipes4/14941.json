                "reviewBody": "I was looking for a recipe to use up some zucchini and spinach I had in the refigerator. This is a good starter but I agree with LindaT's comment about blandness. Perhaps the original recipe was designed to be low fat low sodium but it doesn't have to be nearly so bland. Second time I made it I sauteed the onions and zucchini in a little canola oil and substituted vegetable broth for the water (about one inch over the tops of the vegetables). I skipped the soy sauce as I find its flavor overpowered the mild veggies and substituted rice wine vinegar for a little acid. I added salt cumin basil and some red pepper flakes for more spice. A much more flavorful version was the result in my opinion.",
