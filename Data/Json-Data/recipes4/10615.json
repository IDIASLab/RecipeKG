The main complaint I have with this recipe is that no ballpark amount of water is indicated and I initially added too much (even though I've made similar egg noodles before). I had to add a lot more flour to counteract my mistake and it may have impacted the flavor. To dry these noodles faster I spread them on cookie sheets and put them in an oven set to 175 for about 35 minutes. It worked very well. I suggest making a big batch (maybe double or triple) and freezing them to keep on hand so that you can have homemade taste without all the prep work each time!",

Being single it's easy to slip into eating fast food day after day but having simple and easy to follow ways to make childhood fravorites saves not only money but also our health. Thank you for the Recipe (I never had made egg noodles before despite cooking nearly every day for almost 6 years)",
