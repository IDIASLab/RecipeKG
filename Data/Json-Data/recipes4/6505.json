I added extra carrots & onion and only used 2 thighs but it was a fabulous meal for two.  I threw the bones, leftover meat & veggies with the juices in a pan later to cook up some freezable broth as well!  The only thing I will change next time is to cut open the cooking bag about 45 min in to allow the skin to crisp up a little.  Otherwise, it was a Winner!  Thanks, MJ!!",

As suggested by another reviewer, I opened the bag and switched the broil on for the last few minutes to crisp up the skin.   \n\nThanks :)",

It takes just over an hour from start to finish. I usually cook it with two thighs but keep the same amount of veggies. Delish!",
