I was a little concerned about using one cup of the steak sauce but since this was the first time I was making it and potentially the first review I wanted to make it exactly as the Chef called for. The overall process was very easy and it did give off a nice fragrance during simmering. The one thing that has to be said is that if you are going to like this recipe you will have to LOVE the steak sauce you use. It really was too vinegary for my wife and I. Giving some thought to this now next time I would cut back on the Steak Sauce to 1/2 a cup and maybe use 6 oz. of Tomato Paste. I would also definitely serve with a dollop of Sour Cream.",
