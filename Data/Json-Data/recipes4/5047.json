I was excited to try this recipe considering how easy it was along with the few ingredients, but her excitement about the cookie had me so courious that I could not wait for other reviews which is something I would typically never think of doing.  As for the recipe...I took my short shopping list to Walmart and of course could not find raspberry baking chips so I had to improvise the recipe slightly.  I added & beat in 2 teaspoons of raspberry extract to the egg/cream cheese mixture, then the cookie mix per the instructions..and just because I felt I needed to add something to replace the raspberry chips, I folded in some white chocolate chips.   I did not flatten down the cookie dough prior to baking and ended up with 30 cake-cookies.  My hubby absolutely LOVED these and took them to work to share, (and brag about my cooking LOL).  Mis7-Up thank you for an awesome recipe!",

They are under 4 dollars a bag and the shipping is really inexpensive. My blog is attached to my name ;-) As for my recipe. My family loves these little humdingers! As much as chocolate is a great craving...we crave these more. Fluffy, lite and full of flavor. Will add this to note: If your cookies are lumpy....you've not incorperated the ingredients well enough. Reason could be for 2 things. 1. not mixed well with the cookie mix & 2. Cream cheese was not at room temp and soft when mixing together. This has been an addicting cookie from the start. The chips makes the cookie burst with flavor. I've taken note in my blog of another AR'er that has made her own raspberry chips to suit her and kuddos...hope others see notes to help make them from scratch...Hope y'all enjoy.",

If you love raspberry cheesecake but don't want to take all the time and effort to make it well this little cookie is for you! You get all the flavor of the cheesecake with just four little ingredients all wrapped in sweet bite-sized little treat...what more could you ask for? Ever since I spotted this as one of mis7up's personal recipes I had to try this. So I ordered the raspberry baking chips (available on Amazon.com) and anxiously awaited their arrival. It's impossible to eat just one of these and I have to agree mis7up you've created a monster as these are highly addictive. These bake up beautifully and are hard to resist straight out of the oven. Break out the ice cold milk napkins and enjoy. I drizzled these with a bit of white chocolate and again took the title of \"Best Aunt Ever\"! Thanks for a truly wonderful and creative yet dangerously simple recipe!",

I even went out of my way to find and order raspberry chips just to make these cookies because there were so many raving reviews about them. First of all I didn't enjoy the strong artificial flavors of these cookies. Second I didn't like the textures of them. Since I was determined to like these I made them 3 times to make sure I didn't mess up anything but I still didn't care for them. My 6-year-old did like them though. But my 4-year-old didn't like them at all either. So there it is my honest review/opinion. Hope it helps.",

The Raspberry Tidbits (baking chips) are one of the best (new to me) products I have used in a long time. Thank you for finding them and posting it. They have so much flavor and take these cookies to a new level. We love the soft texture of these cookies and the Cream Cheese makes them taste straight from the bakery. You would never know that a packaged sugar cookie mix is used. I got 32 cookies out of this and between 5 of us there are only 18 left (I just made them earlier today!!:) I also ordered the Strawberry and Blueberry Tidbits and can not wait to try these with those flavors. This is an excellent recipe mis7up. Thank you so much for sharing!!!",
