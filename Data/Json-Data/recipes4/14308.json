I enjoyed the biscuit-like crust but found it baked up very thick. I would cut the amound of crust and roll it thinner. As written the crust was about an inch thick after baking and overwhelmed the filling. We ended up scooping out filling to add to the crust portions on the plates. Tasty recipe but this needs a few tweeks as mentioned above.",
