My 5 star rating is based off the actual recipe as I think recipes should be rated as it is written not by changing/adding ingredients. With that being said the recipe did make a huge quantity and I could've made 2 trifles with it. Seriously. But who doesn't like leftover dessert! The only thing I did differently was to bake the brownies in a brownie pan and the cake in a 13x9 cake pan (since that's the only pans that I had). This is my new go-to recipe for dessert when entertaining. Absolutely delicious!!!",
