                "reviewBody": "these are actually quite delicious. Being Dutch from the Netherlands here is how I adapted these \"oil balls\" as my kids call them in English. My parents used beer but I tried this recipe using a room temperature sparkling water. Worked great. Typically I only let the dough rise a couple of hours. This too worked great. I figured it out using the Weight Watcher points and I think if I make them a mini size they are 3 points and then I can have two! They are a personal favorite and we always put a little food coloring in the powdered sugar and start making these Dutch homemade donuts towards fall. I have been know to sneak in bits of Halloween candy! Its all yummy. I will try to post a picture when I have made a batch of mini Ollibollen.",
