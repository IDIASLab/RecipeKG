I also substituted white rice with instant brown rice, and the veg oil for extra virgin olive oil.  Delicious!  I make this once every month or two and we never get tired of it.",

I increase the rice to 1/2 cup and cook the rice with one chicken boullion cube; only use 1 tablespoon of the oil (and I use olive oil); I use 1/2 cup of regular chopped onion instead of 1 cup of green onion; I doubled the spices and only used 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar in the casserole and 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar on top.  GREAT recipe and a wonderful way to use the vegetables from my garden.  You won't be disappointed!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great idea, and a delicious way to serve vegetables. With a few alterations, this recipe is wonderful. To make the rice more flavorful, add vegetable stock and about a teaspoon of garlic salt instead of water while making your rice...it adds so much flavor. Then, I broil the zucchini and red onion in a broiling pan with a thin coating of olive oil and a seasoning rub including about a 2 teaspoons of each seasoning: garlic powder, cumin, pepper, oregano, and then I salt to taste. This takes about 10-15 minutes (or until they are lightly browned). I can't tell you how much flavor this adds to your vegetables (without adding all the fat that would get absorbed from frying them in a skillet). \n\nThen I just add the broiled vegtables to my cassarole dish that has the rice spread in the bottom. I mix the rice and veggies so that the seasonings are mixed into the rice. Then, simply top with the amount of cheese you want, pop back in the oven for 10 minutes at 350 degrees and dinner is served. This may sound like a bit more work, but trust me...its worth the effort.",
