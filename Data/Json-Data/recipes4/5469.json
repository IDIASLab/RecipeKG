I like to add one large sliced onion and a teaspoon or so of chili powder for a little kick. I use LTH's Meatball Nirvana recipe (which is also from this site) in this dish. You're best off doubling it because this never fails to go fast. If I'm making this for dinner, I like to serve it with mashed potatoes or buttered rice to soak up all that yummy sauce.",
