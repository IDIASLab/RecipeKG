I usually add some garlic, bay leaf, and a bit of oregano. sometimes a cube of chicken bouillon.   If you saut\u00e9 the onions  and other veg before adding the peas, you can reduce the time by using a pressure cooker for 15 minutes after bringing pot up to 15 pounds of pressure (high) for twelve minutes, and allow pressure to reduce slowly.  If the peas are old, you ay need to put pot back on and cook a little longer, but as pot is hot, it wont take long to return to pressure.  All in all, however you make it, nothing beats split pea soup on a cold Canadian winter's day.  tomorrow I hear, should reach a high of minus 27 C. soup will be on the stove or in the pressure cooker to save electricity.",

                "reviewBody": "Omit the salt, that is way too much and ham is already very salty. People can add it in their own bowl if they want more. Obviously you need to leave the ham bone in during the entire cooking process or you will not have any substance or flavour to the stock. I needed almost twice as much water to cover my ham bone, my ham was not that big so I'm not sure about the measurements for this recipe, be forewarned. I used 4 cups of yellow peas (the entire bag).  I took my ham bone out after 3 hours, removed what meat was left on it along with the large chunks of ham that had already fallen off. I removed excess fat and roughly chopped and shredded the ham and then returned it to the pot and then added the carrots and let it simmer on low-medium for 45 additional minutes. If you do what the recipe says and add the carrots at the beginning, you risk the soup burning and sticking to the pot because the sugar content in the carrots makes it more likely to stick and burn. Also, diced carrots will nearly disintegrate after cooking for 3 hours. If I had not been paying attention, the soup would have burnt as some peas and carrots had already started sticking to the bottom of the pot even with all of the fat from the ham.  I did not use thyme since I don't like it. I used 1 tsp. of cumin instead and skipped the bay leaf as well. I did not add salt as the ham already had a high salt content. I threw in a small handful of peppercorns and removed most of them at the end. I would not use this ",

I was able to make it very quickly because I already had a flavorful broth ready.\n\nMy men gobbled it up so that tells me it was delicious.  I just need to disclose that I made broth one day and made soup the next so that could have intensified the flavors?  \n\nAnyways, I would absolutely make this again.  The entire pot was empty in one day as my guys came and went to and from their shift work jobs.  I was shocked the next day when I realized the entire pot of soup was all gone.
