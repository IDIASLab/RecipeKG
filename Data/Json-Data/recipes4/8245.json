The one problem for me was there was not enough of it to coat and entire head of broccoli and cauliflower. I recommend either doubling the cheese sauce or only using 1/2 head each of the broccoli and cauliflower. I will most definitely make this again with my changes. Excellent! Thanks for sharing!",

The flavor was weird with all the extra seasonings in the roux and it could have been significantly simplified. I really didn't care for the nutmeg or mustard in the roux. And the sauce was not nearly enough for the volume of vegetable called for! Almost needed to double it. The second time making this- I followed more of the base from the Brussels Sprouts Gratin recipe on this site- just left out the bacon. And it turned out WAY better! Using heavy cream instead of making a roux & cheese sauce was much easier I just added a bit more shredded cheese to mix in before baking and left the seasoning to salt pepper and a bit of garlic & onion powder. Following the other recipe the second time around it took half the amount of time. Boiled the veggies added seasonings cream cheese & then topped with bread crumbs & Parmesan before baking. The consistency & flavor was complimented. 3 stars for the base... but leave out the unnecessary spices & double the sauce. Otherwise- just use the Brussels Sprouts Gratin recipe & sub in the cauliflower & broccoli.",

I might cook my cauliflower just a hair less next time (I like mine just a bit more firm) but this was a comforting meal at the end of a long day. It also reheated well for lunch which is always a plus for me. Next time I might use a different mustard but I liked the kick it gave. And I could see doing this with either just broccoli or just cauliflower...or some other combo of veggies. It\u2019s an easy dish to add to - I could see using some mushrooms or whatever else you have in the fridge.  I didn\u2019t have any tortilla chips unfortunately so I topped mine with bread crumbs. Will make again. Thanks!",
