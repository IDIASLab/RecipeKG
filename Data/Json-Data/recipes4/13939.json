This can easily be prepared ahead of time and assembled just prior to baking. Note that fresh herbs should be used wherever possible. When fresh is not possible, high quality dried herbs are acceptable. Don't use the ones you've had in the back of the cupboard for 5 years. The flavor won't be the same. For extra flavor, grind cinnamon sticks and whole nutmeg in a spice grinder.",

After half the water has been incorporated, watch closely, as mixture will come together suddenly. Once it begins to stick together, gather into a ball, divide into halves, and roll each ball out to 1/4-inch thickness, adding flour as necessary to prevent sticking.

The recipe is so simple which makes the pie all the more fun as it offers the flexibility to switch things up according to taste. I for example use leaks plus shallots and chicken broth instead of water and chicken base. Peas go in very last minute so they still have a nice pop when eaten.",

I did not use a crust (so it was more like a casserole). Instead I made the Cheddar Buttermilk Biscuits from this site and served them on top of the pot pie. I also added some sage to the biscuits. 2. I used a whole pound of carrots left out the celery (because I forgot to buy it) and used redskin potatoes (a whole bag) with their skins on. 3. I added a few dashes of cayenne pepper with the rest of the seasoning to match the cayenne pepper in the biscuits. 4. I added 1/2C plain nonfat Greek yogurt to the sauce making it a little thicker and more creamy:) I ended up filling a 9x13\" glass dish to the very top covering it with foil and baking for 40 minutes. The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because the prep took me almost an hour. Maybe I'm just slow at prepping but precooking the chicken and vegetables took at least half an hour not to mention dicing and slicing everything. Otherwise awesome. I will definitely make this again!",
