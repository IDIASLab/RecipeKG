The second time I made it I added a can of hominy. The flavor was incredible. It was great with sourdough bread. I wanted a little more sauce so I used 1 cup wine and three cans tomato sauce. This recipe does taste better over time. The second and third days later were even better. Thanks for a great recipe. Another time I did not have zucchini so I added a can of corn and a can of green beans. Still added a cup of wine. Delish!",
