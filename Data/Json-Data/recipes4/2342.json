So I was thrilled to find a recipe so different.  I used Cool Ranch crumbs and lot of chili mupowder, including chipotle chilli powder. My son, who hates fish, asked me to make it again soon.  But as we were licking our lips. My devious mind was thinking of \"improvements\".   When I made it next, I made a red sauce with lots of cilantro to spread over the crisp fish.  I also topped each filet with a spoonful of sour cream and one of guacamole. The coating on the fish stayed crisp, ,All flavors worked together to make one of the yummiest fish dishes I've ever had.
