I usually do use more garlic in mine too but most people don't like a lot of garlic so I toned it down for this recipe.",

I guess it was the combination of garlic sausage egg and the cheese turned it from a hamburger into a meatloaf type burger. It tasted good just not what we were expecting...I topped with steak sauce lettuce tomato onion and pickles - maybe if we had used BBQ sauce. Thank you so much for recipe....",
