If you cook your turkey at 325 degrees F, it will be perfect if the stuffing is cooked alongside it at that temp as well. It can also be baked in a muffin tin for individual servings.",

I used chicken broth instead of turkey broth and I sauteed the onion in butter/oil along with a couple ribs of celery.

I made a few changes, but they were omissions, not additions (meats). To my delight (and my husband's), this is EXACTLY like his grandmother used to make! He even forewent a lot of other side dishes to eat more of this. A keeper and I thank you!!",
