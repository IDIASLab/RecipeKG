I used 2 cups of drained boiled chickpeas instead of canned as well as adding a zucchine and a couple of carrots cooking everything in my pressure cooker in 10 minutes. I augmented the water and regret it as it seems to have become more a soup than a stew. So do keep an eye on the liquids if you add more veggies as they will add their own juices. Thank you Anniesails for this recipe.",
