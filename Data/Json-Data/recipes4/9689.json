I used two beets rather than one (and next time, I'd use three) and I did not discard them after boiling.  I chopped one beet into small dice and pureed the other.  I added both right before service.  Without the addition of the puree, the soup would have been bright orange rather than the deep ruby color I expect from borscht.  \n\nOther changes I made:  Added a tablespoon of dried dill toward the end of cooking, omitted about half of the butter and all of the celery (is \"half a stalk\" reallly going to add any flavor or texture?), didn't reserve the 1/2 c of tomato sauce (this step seemed unnecessary since everything gets mixed together anyway), and I used only about half of the cabbage called for and still found it to be a very cabbage-y soup (3 cups would have been serious overkill).  Be sure to taste the soup before serving.  I found that it needed quite a bit more salt and pepper than called for.  \n\nGarnished with sour cream, of course.\n\nI will make borscht again, but not according to this recipe.",

This recipe though is INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS (and really the most remarkable shade of purple/magenta when you use red cabbage...can't beat that)! I even used extra beets (2 large & 3 small) then chopped them up and left them in as people recommended (I figured it was too much work to puree or shred the beets)...and I psychotically love this soup. I think I could eat it every day. The dollop of sour cream was a great touch too. I just had the last bowl...sniff...I think I need to get more beets and make this again. I'll try with much less butter next time though...that was kind of an alarming amount for a vegetable soup.",

A couple of cloves of garlic in the sauce really enhances the flavour. Also I like to fry all of the cabbage so it is all of a consistant texture. Serve the soup with some sourdough bread and you will have a instant hit. If any of you ever end up in the Kootenay region of British Columbia Canada you should stop by the Grand Forks Hotel. Their diner makes a wonderful example of this soup and also has many other traditional Russian dishes that you are bound to enjoy. Cheers Mike",
