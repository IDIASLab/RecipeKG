I made the following modifications based on the ingredients I had on hand: I used leftover duck instead of turkey (maybe 2 cups) frozen peas instead of canned chicken broth instead of turkey stock 1 1/2 tsp dried minced garlic instead of fresh and 1 tsp each of dried thyme oregano and sage instead of fresh. Because I've never had a pot pie that did not include potatoes and could not imagine making one without them I added 1 1/2 medium potatoes to the recipe (I diced them into 1/4\" cubes and microwaved them in water for about 3 minutes to soften then added them at the pea/herbs stage). To please my husband (he can't stand the texture of mushrooms) I pureed the mushrooms in my mini food processor to preserve the flavor while eliminating the texture. To save time (and because I wanted biscuits) I nixed the pie crust and instead poured the filling into a glass brownie pan that had been sprayed with cooking spray baked for 10 or 15 min then topped with Bisquick drop biscuits (I made enough for 15 drop biscuits) and baked for 10 more minutes. Dinner was filling and tasty -- I'll definitely be coming back to this recipe. I might try adding a bit more butter next time to make the filling even more rich.",

Next time I might back off on the thyme a bit.(I didn't have sage so I left that out.) The idea of cooking the bottom crust first was excellent--I was afraid it would become misshapen but it was fine. Probably the only big change I made was to use white zinfandel which is pale pink instead of red wine. I've made coq au vin which uses red wine and I agree that the purply color is off-putting so I subbed the white zin. Next time I will grit my teeth and try it with red wine to see if there's a taste difference. This only gets four stars because the filling was pretty runny.",

The only things I changed were to use chicken instead of turkey chicken broth instead of turkey broth and rosemary instead of oregano. The crust was very good. I'm not sure the filling was anything special and the color was a bit offputting. I think it definitely needed more gravy. I don't know that I'd make it again.",
