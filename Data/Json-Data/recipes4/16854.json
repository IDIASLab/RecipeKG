I used frozen mango so I did reduce the ice a little and since I like smoothies a little on the thick side reduced the water as well. I must admit that I've developed a taste for smoothies with a little Greek yogurt so as a personal taste preference I will add about 1/3 cup vanilla Greek yogurt next time. However this is simply pure sweet fruitiness from a combination of perfectly-ripe summer fruit and it gives you a real pop of vibrant flavor. Very nice.",

I also added a dash of vanilla and after tasting I added a squeeze of fresh lime. I used less water...maybe half a cup or so. Perfection but since I like to play around with my food I'll probably also add a slice of fresh ginger the next time...and there'll be a next time.:) This is perfect for frozen mangoes and cherries too and I keep my freezer stocked with those. A new summer fave!",
