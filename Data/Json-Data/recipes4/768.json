I also added a bit more milke at the end to get it to be a little creamier and not so thick.  Anyway, it was heavenly and I will definitely be making this again and again!!",

                "reviewBody": "Great recipe, easy to adjust to personal liking. I read the negative reviews, some of which suggested bland flavor and others that had issues with grainy texture or overly pastey textures- all of these issues are a personal preference that as a cook you should adjust yourself. If too bland add more salt and seasoning I added more salt, a bunch of fresh parsley and heavy cream with more milk than called for. I also changed the cheeses up to include swiss and gruyere instead of colby-jack  because to me that is what Alfredo should have. i used a blend of shallots, onions and garlic along with 10oz of mushrooms and fried it up until golden, added flour and CLUMPING is normal, you should add the liquids and mix until smooth- you must use a relatively LOW heat and mix, mix, mix and MIX while adding all the cheeses and milk/cream. If you have grainy texture this is a technique issue not a recipe issue. Overall i think this is a great recipe and allows for a lot of variation depending on what you have on hand, and that is the ultimate 'homestyle' recipe in my book. Thanks",

I was careful not to use all the italian seasoning the recipe called for and I added fresh peas and black pepper instead of white. I'm having a party next week and I can't wait to make it again.

First off, this is waaaaay too much sauce for 1 pound of pasta. I thought for sure with all the layers of flavors going on here that it was going to blow me away, but I was surprised that it was actually really, really bland. The sauce turned out very grainy, even though I was super careful when melting the cheese, and when I combined the finished sauce with the pasta, it seemed to seperate and sort of curdle (all of my ingredients were just bought and fresh, so...). The idea of this is great and with all the great reviews I just knew I stumbled upon a winner, but, alas, I was quite disappointed in the finished product as well as the time and money invested...sorry.",
