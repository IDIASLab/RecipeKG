I do have to say that after tasting a test patty I found these kind of bland and too moist to hold together. I added more flour and cheese a beaten egg lots of chives some minced onion and red bell pepper and a little garlic. They turned out quite nice looking and very tasty with a unique texture and a subtle sweetness. Since squash sizes vary so greatly I would have preferred a cup measurement rather than just calling for one squash.",

We ate them plain seasoned with only salt and pepper simply because I did not realize I was out of sour cream.
