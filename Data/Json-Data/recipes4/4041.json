I had a little trouble mixing the jelly and balsamic until smooth but heating it slightly in the microwave remedied that. The sauce is thin and sweet but not too sweet and very good drizzled over the pork and apples. I didn t peel my apples but next time I would. The skins didn t get quite as soft as I would have liked.",

                "reviewBody": "This was the best pork tenderloin I've ever had. I think there are a couple of reasons why this recipe succeeds. 1. The pork is taking a liquid bath throughout the entire cooking process, making it some of the moistest meat I've ever had.  Moreover it retains its juicyness in the leftover phase and is even better if left with the original pan juices. 2. The apple components are a natural pairing for pork.  Though the apples serve as more of a garnish, the apple jelly includes more liquid component and adds sweetness to an already savory pork. It pained my grandmother to admit that this recipe was better than my other grandmother's. Doesn't that make it worth it?",

To do this I buy a large loin and increase th veggies put it all in a turkey roaster pour the apple mixture and the balsamic vinegar mixture over it all and turn the oven on to 250 and leave it for a few hours. I have found this works great if you can't be home all day to cook add some rolls and a salad and you have a wonderful dinner.",
