I modified it a teeny bit as I used a smaller Brie wheel and sliced it in half spreading apricot preserves and pecans in the middle. Wrapped in 8 oz pkg of the crescent roll, gave it a egg wash, and baked it for 15 minutes, THEN added the honey and pecans to the top and baked it for another 15 minutes. I served it with sliced granny smith apples and seedless green grapes & wheat crackers. My Date went nuts over it. I have never seen him dive into something like he did this. Easy to prepare, makes a beautiful presentation, and is unbelievably good. I will be keeping this recipe.",

I used four Rhodes white Texas rolls (you could use six Rhodes white dinner rolls, too--it would come out to the same dough weight).  I pressed the rolls together and rolled them out to a 9-10\" circle.  I drizzled the center with honey, sprinkled with walnuts, topped with the brie, and wrapped the dough around it.  Placed seam-side down on the baking sheet, brushed with egg, drizzled with additional honey, sprinkled additional walnuts, and baked for 35 minutes or so.  Healthier than crescent roll dough, and even picky husband loved it!",
