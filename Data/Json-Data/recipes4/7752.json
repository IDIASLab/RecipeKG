I'm glad that I did this time and it was a portion of a petite ciabatta bread. I scaled the recipe in half and sliced the bread in 1/2\" pieces placing on a sheet pan that I lined with foil and lightly sprayed with cooking spray. I even made a special trip to the store to get the dried minced garlic. I also added a little dried parsley to the mixture. I went by another recipe on this site that I've made spreading the butter/garlic mixture on both sides baking at 375degF for about 7 min turn and then bake another 6-7 min. Excellent and thanks for the great starting point! NOTE: Not good texture 24 hrs later; best to have when just made.",
