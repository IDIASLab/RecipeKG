The one thing he said was that NO left overs where wasted at the hotdog stand! Which makes perfect sense during the time frame of the depression. So what was on the menu is the major components of the sauce. The only meat products they sold were steer burgers and hotdogs. steer burgers where basically steamed hamburgers broiled in onions. The sauce is definitely made form left over steer burgers and hotdogs ground fine! The other major item they sold was black coffee! this is the big secret they threw nothing away not even left over coffee! There is no tomato products the sauce color comes from the seasonings. there is NO sausage they did not sell sausage. there is no cinnamon! the seasonings in the recipe above are very close but no cinnamon the coffee brings the red brown color and tones the peppers down adding that slight bitterness. steer burgers hotdogs and black coffee are confirmed No tomato products not even catsup is confirmed. Cinnamon is not an ingredient and is confirmed (we tried that before and found that Uncle Binky said we where correct). Again look at the times and menu at the early Texas wiener stand and think the way they did during the depression!",
