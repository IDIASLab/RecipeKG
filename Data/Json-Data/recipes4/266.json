                "reviewBody": "There are few things that scream \"SUMMER\" like grilled corn on the cob.  I do mine a little differntly than this however, and it is fantastic!  First of all, DO NOT remove the husks - they are vital to the flavor and cooking process.  Only peel a little bit back to make sure you do not have a bad one.  You can tear off any long silk that is sticking out, but do not worry about the ones inside (they come off easily after they are cooked).  Put the corn in a cooler or bucket large enough to hold them all and completely cover with clean water.  Allow them to soak for at least an hour or up to several hours and keep turning them because they float.  When it comes time to cook, quickly drain the excess water out the tops and put them on a hot grill for approximately 30 minutes.  Be sure to turn them every 5 minutes or so and rotate them around the grill too.  The husks will burn and some may even catch on fire - this is normal.  Remove any husks that fall off.   The corn itself will not burn because it is being steamed from the inside due to the soaking (as long as you rotate them).  Also, do not put directly on hot coals - this will surely cause burn spots.  Once the husks are mostly all blackened, remove from grill, and husk.  Most of the silk, if not all, will come off at this time  They will stay hot for at least 30 minutes as long as the husks are left on, and be carefull not to burn your hands while husking.  Season to taste with butter, salt, pepper, or whatever you like.",

For some of you who had trouble getting your corn done quick enough,here's a hint that applies to any food that's wrapped in foil. In this case, wrap the corn-on-the-cob with the shiny side in.  This keeps the heat in and helps to cook faster. With the shiny side out, the foil is reflecting more of the heat...so longer cooking time.",
