If it calls for 2c water add two cubes and so forth. Even if you add nothing else remember the bouillon.  Here are some other tips: Depending on your taste try adding drained black or green olives.  You can add alittle jalepeno pepper to give it some zip.  Any flavored cheese works with this-So what ever mood you are in cheese it up that way and add your own spices. Over all it is one of those recipes that allows variety.  It is a great base to start with and a great way to introduce cassaroles to the kids.  They simply love it due to the cheese.",

                "reviewBody": "As others have said, this is a good base recipe to build on.  As written it seems bland.  However, I followed the steps for the most part and tweaked it to my own taste.  Here is what I did:  Sauteed diced onion and red bell pepper in a little oil until tender (not translucent, but tender ... about three minutes), added in ground turkey (because that is what I had on hand), browned it until done, added the water and three chicken bouillon cubes (you should always use one cube per cup of water, but I added in three cubes since I didn't know how to halve one), added the rice, a can of diced tomatoes, and then black pepper, a little seasoning salt, a tad bit of celery salt, some garlic powder and onion powder, and let it simmer for about 30 minutes (until most of the liquid had soaked into everything).  Then I poured everything into a baking dish, covered it with torn up pepperjack cheese slices and put it in the oven on 350 for about 10 minutes (long enough for the cheese to melt).  BOY!  WAS THIS GOOD.  I served it with salad.  Again, I think this recipe, as written, would be extremely bland unless you like bland food.  For those of us who like full flavor and that \"kick\", you definitely need to take it up a notch.",

So I cooked it by itself (1c. nishiki brown rice 2 1/2 c water) for 30 minutes. Than I put it with the meat for 15 minutes together. By then it was more than ready for the tomatoes. I used one 10 oz. can of diced tomatoes and green chillis. This took care of any blandness others may have found. I used one 8 oz. block of monterey jack cheese that I shredded. I mixed it in a little while it was melting so it made it really creamy. This was EXCELLANT! I love it! The only problem I have is that the kids (5 4 2) didn't like it but the baby (1) did. Go figure. If my husband were here it would be gone. This made more than enough for a family of six.",
