It was a little interesting that no onions (or even onion powder) was in it as most chilis have it - I didn't miss them though. It was also a bit unusual and nice that two kinds of beans were used. I happen to like blazing-hot food and this was definitely mild-mannered. It might have just been my crock-pot (mine is very large) but I found that the chili didn't get all that hot after cooking for 3 hours on Low. The chili came out nice and thick and was perhaps a bit too heavy on the tomato flavor. I didn't really mind these last points but noting that three kinds of tomatoes were used here I might have cut back or even omitted the tomato paste for example. Overall I liked this - it lasted me for two nights totaling four big bowlfuls. It might not be the best chili ever but it's still worth recommending.",
