I flavored the whipped cream with cream d'menthe a touch of green food coloring and made the Betty Crocker raspberry sauce to drizzle over it. It looked very Christmasy and attractive with these additions. The mint chocolate and raspbery were great together but in the end its still cookies and whipping cream and has a tendency to fall apart even when sliced on the diagonal.",

But she only made it for parties and the kids (us) only got to taste the leftovers. It was delicious. We always called it \"blow up cake\" because the cookies swell up a bit with the whipped cream and then they really look \"blown up\" when you cut it on the diagonal. This cake is really neat because of the diagonal cutting method (crucial for the serving and presentation) no one can figure out how you made the \"layers\" like that. A very gourmet mystery. Unfortunately I live in a small town with a pretty ordinary grocery and those chocolate wafer cookies are almost unheard of. I have to go to the \"big city\" to find them. Sprinkle colored sugar or non-pariels on the top for a little festive look too.",

It could be that some people do not whip their whipping cream enough. we only put in about a tablespoon of regular sugar to the whipping cream near the end. It has to sit for at least 5 hours so the wafers pick up the wetness from the whipped cream and fatten up. Also we have always used THIN wafers (from Nabisco0 and not Oreos. It's very cakelike.

Be sure you let it stand for at least the specified time or it will be impossible to cut (you want the cookies to absorb moisture from the whipped cream and turn cake-like). Also be sure to slice at a 45 degree angle to the roll to get the striped effect. I tried this once with Cool Whip it's not anywhere near as good as with real whipping cream flavor-wise and for some reason it comes out much drier.",
