Please watch while cooking this. I had it in for the first bake and checked it @ 10 minutes and it was getting pretty dark on top so I took it out mixed it and put it back in for another 10 minutes This was fine but I think I could've baked it even a little less but I'll keep a better eye on it next time.. I guess it really depends on your oven just a heads up. Other than that it was liked by all and I would make it again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
