I made this cake for my husband's family, and was really embarrassed when we all took our first bite.  I had been hoping that the cake would taste better than it smelled, but it was worse.  Thankfully, the frosting (whipped cream, cream of coconut pudding, flaked coconut, and crushed pineapple) was delicious, so we scrapped it off of the cake and ate that by itself.  \n\nLike I said, I hate giving bad reviews, so I apologize, but I regret wasting my time making and serving this cake so I felt it was important to share my feelings on it.",
