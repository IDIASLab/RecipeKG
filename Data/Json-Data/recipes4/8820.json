Update:  I just reread the recipe and I didn't bother adding the vinegar, perhaps that's why it was too spicey!!  I'll try again following the real recipe.  I know I'll like it though!  12/29/09 update*** I followed the recipe except only used the juice from a 12 oz bottle of jalepenos.  Only added about 4 pieces of jalepono slices to the 1 pint jars I had and then added the carrots and onions, poured in the hot juice & vinegar.  Oh my!! They're still very spicey.  I guess I'm a wimp but next time I'll not put all the jalepeno juice in with the vinegar and maybe just 1 or 2 slices in the jars.  My mouth is still burning and I sure don't remember them doing that at my favorite mexican restaurant in Merced, CA from many many years ago!",

They were great and tasted just like we use to get in one of our favorite mexican restaurant.

The vinegar tamed the heat somewhat, the end probably was hot but tolerable.",
