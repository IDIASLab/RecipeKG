I will definitely make this again, we loved the contrast of the sweet preserves against the salty pork.",

I served it w/ rice I made in my rice cooker w/ vegetable stock instead of water and a side of green beans. I liked the hot jelly and it gave it some kick! Also threw in a 1/2 teaspoon of dijon mustard and left out the honey. It tasted as though it had marinated over night -- couldn't believe it was this flavorful for only 15 minutes of the glaze at the end. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",
