The second day we added water chestnuts and bamboo shoots. I added more garlic scallions & mushrooms than the original recipe called for because we like a chunky soup. I omitted the carrots. This tastes just like the soup at our favorite (upscale) restaurant. Thanks for sharing!!",

I served it as an appetizer before a ginger-garlic stir-fry. I did add extra ginger and garlic (as we like it) and only 1 cubed chicken breast which was quite enough chicken. I also added diced potato to chunk it up since I didn't have the mushrooms or snow peas. I wish I did it would have really added to the soup! Will try some kale in it next time too. DH said it was fantastic better than what our 3 local Japanese steakhouse and our sushi bars serve. He said I have to make it again - often. He also said it was his new favorite soup!",
