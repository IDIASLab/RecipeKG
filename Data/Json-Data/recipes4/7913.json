This cake was incredibly moist incredibly easy incredibly tasty and has incredible eye appeal!! The topping was done after 30 seconds in the microwave and had a rich chocolate-peanut butter flavor. I did add a few chopped peanuts as a garnish. I seldom buy cake mixes but wouldn't hesitate to buy another to make this again...and again...and again. My sweet tooth is doing the happy dance. Jessica Croisant thanks for sharing your recipe. UPDATE Did a variation on this recipe today using swiss chocolate cake mix white chocolate chips and garnished with some strawberries and blueberries. As always turned out delicious!",
