I am sure that as written this would be a tasty recipe, but the way mine turned out with the changes it was delicious.  I made this with only the ingredients I had on hand:  Used 1/2 mild sausage, 1/2 hamburger, McCormick original Taco Seasoning (to taste), 1 Pkg. Knorr Ready to Heat Spanish Style Rice, V8 Healthy Blend Vegetable Juice (not watered down) and Sargento Italian Aged Cheese Blend.  Prepared the peppers as stated, mixed the cooked hamburger and sausage with microwaved rice and taco seasoning,  stuffed the peppers, poured some V8 juice over all and topped with the cheese blend.  Baked as directed.  A real winner!  We've never tasted poblano peppers before and this recipe left a good taste in our mouths!!!",
