You not only gave me a delicious side dish but I used the leftovers to make a main dish that I will probably also do again and again.  I chopped the leftovers and mixed in 1/2 lb. of seasoned browned ground pork, rolled in egg roll wrappers and fried to golden perfection.  I love a recipe that can give me two distinct meals!",

Thanks for sharing this recipe with the community. My 1/4 Cherokee friend/co-worker raved about this recipe for years.  It always sounded too greasy, until I tried it......OMG! It's sooooooo comforting. He used 'fatback' (smoked pork fat)===less salty than bacon and no nitrites. Anyway, a great southern recipe, and I'm glad you shared it. P.S.  Try some red Savoy cabbage with the green kind.  It doesn't wilt so much and has a sweeter flavor. I'd like to see a good recipe for baked beans, Southern Style! Mitchy48",

As far as the salt goes, I only added about 1/2tsp. at first (I was only using 1/2 a fairly small cabbage.  AT first, before simmering for 30 minutes it tasted just right for us.  Then, after the simmer, I tasted before serving and the salt had almost disappered so I added a few sprinkles more.  I can see if you have a huge cabbage where you may need quite a bit.
