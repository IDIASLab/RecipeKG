The down side is that it takes 10 - 14 hours to completely carmelize the onions using the slow cooker. If done for 10 hours, there is a lot of liquid to be drained off for use in another dish (French Onion soup maybe?). If cooked  for the additional 4 hours with lid slightly off set, the liquid evaporates and the onions become a deeper caramel color. If you don't need them right away, this is the way to go as they can be frozen; otherwise they'll need to be done in the skillet which is definitely quicker but much more labor intensive.",

I then used the saute normal feature on the pot and cooked down some of the onion liquid but did reserve some for today s dinner French Dip sandwiches. In a word these onions are DEEE-LICIOUS! Last night used them on a grilled cheese and bacon sandwich and over the weekend they ll be heading into some French onion soup. I scooped the caramelized onions into the cups of a muffin tin lined with paper cupcake liners and then put them in the freezer. When they were frozen I removed them the muffin tin and transferred them to a gallon-size zip-lock bag. Caramelized onions add such incredible flavor and sweetness to so many dishes but they do take some time to caramelize often time you don't have for a weekday dinner. It is so convenient to already have them on hand and they can be quickly defrosted in the microwave. If you have a food processor for slicing this is so very very simple to make; you just have to allow the slow cooker enough time to work its magic!",
