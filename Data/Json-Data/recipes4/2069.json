I'm glad I read the other reviews; even at 350-degrees the hens started to get dark brown before they were cooked through so tenting with foil may be needed. Keep a watch on them. Also there is not an abundance of fruit or pan juices so if you like lots you might want to increase the amount of fruit and deglaze the pan with chicken broth or white wine at the end. Definitely worth making!",
