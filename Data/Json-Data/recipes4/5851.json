My Dad loved the chicken. Said it was juicy and very flavorful. My photo doesn't do the bright colors justice. I have seen this recipe without the spinach and will try it that way next time. I will also make a balsamic reduction to create a more intense flavor and prettier presentation. But overall this was a great recipe and pretty easy to make. It would make a great open face sandwich!!",

I modified it a bit to add more veggies: lightly browned on stove top in 2T olive oil, the boneless/skinless chicken breast cut into tenders, coated in Italian dry seasoning/garlic powder/ Salt&pepper, then removed from pan. Added to the pan and suteed lightly [not soft, but not crisp] sliced can mushrooms, 1/2 sliced green zucchini, a sliced green and red pepper, and half a small red onion.  I put veggies in oven- safe baking dish, sprayed with Pam, then topped with chicken, then sauteed spinach with minced jarred garlic,  a layer of Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses and topped with  tomato slices and then balsamic vinegar.  Baked uncovered in 425 degree oven for 35 minutes. When done, I again lightly topped with more Moz. and some Parm. cheeses [to taste] and served over whole wheat pasta. Absolutely delightful! Enough for my dear husband and I to have leftovers for lunch at work the next day.",

Then I put in a fresh diced tomato and just sauteed it until it softened up and then removed that from the pan. I then added a bit more olive oil and cooked the chicken as instructed. I then put the spinach tomatoes and fresh mozzarella on the chicken(I used the small balls cut in half because the store didn't have the larger) and cooked it as instructed. I'm not a huge balsamic fan so I omitted that. My husband said it was restaurant worthy!! Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper!",
