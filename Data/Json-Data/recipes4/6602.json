It is still pretty hot here in Florida so we used our gas grill to roast the vegetables, I used the exact amount called for and tossed in a bowl in olive oil and seasonings called for, but also shook in some dried parsley too. They roasted to perfection in 25 minutes, make sure you keep them spaced on the pan and don't pile on top of each other.\r\nI had some of my homemade Marinara sauce that I used for the sauce instead of store bought, and actually had about 8 ounces more, was glad I did, just enough for the top cover of sauce. I did use the oven ready noodles so I didn't have to boil my noodles and took four to cover each layer, used the whole 12 oz. box. As long as you have a layer of sauce next to those noodles they turn out just like they were boiled. I did miss having ricotta cheese in my lasagna, but heck who needs the extra calories and we all really enjoyed this lasagna. I wasn't sure if the baking temp was supposed to be the same as the veggie roasting temp, but to be safe I baked at 375\u00b0, was bubbling in 30 min.",

Include sliced eggplant (don't forget to salt and drain it first) it fits in perfectly with all the flavours going on in this recipe. Put the eggplant and zucchini on a separate tray to the rest of the vegies cos they'll need to be cooked longer. The prep time of this recipe is lengthy, but it's really worth it. You can also mix in some ricotta cheese into the cheese mix layer for some extra depth and moisture! Love it. Thanks for the recipe.",

Next time, the amount of green bell pepper will be reduced at least in half so that it acts to enhance the flavor rather than dominate it. We might also add different veggies as other reviewers say they did, and some fresh herb(s) would perk up the taste. Those are easy adjustments to make and reflect individual taste preferences rather than anything wrong with the recipe. This lasagna is very similar to Hearty Vegetable Lasagna from this site, and either one makes a yummy meatless meal. Thank you cookntraveler.",
