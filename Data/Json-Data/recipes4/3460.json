I made this tonight using a replacement for the chicken broth:  the dark, wonderful, gelatinous broth that is left from the Roast Sticky Chicken from this site.  It made the sauce rich and more flavorful.  I highly recommend it!  You may need to add a little more broth for the ratio of vinegar:broth because it is thicker.  Very tasty indeed!",

When one merely pan-fries after dredging in oil, the outsides get crispy and blacken before the inside of the meat can cook, which results in improperly cooked meat.  If you wait too long, though, the sauce reduces too much to be sufficient to cover the medallions.  Other than those small things, the flavor of this dish is really good.  I liked the sauce a lot - robust, but not overpowering, and delicious without being too creamy.  ",

I made this like the recipe said. the only thing I did do was add one more cup of chicken broth and a tbls of cornstartch and soy sauce to thicken the sauce a bit more right at the end. the combination of Balsamic Vinegar lemon and broth with capers was so odd yet the flavor was truely awesome. I'll use it on beef as well. Very good thanks for sharing!",
