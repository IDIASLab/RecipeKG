The Jumbo Shrimp I used were pre-cooked and I used 1/2 cup Olive Oil instead of Corn Oil and added Black Pepper Oregano and 1/4 cup sliced Black Olives. I served this for my Appetizer/Cocktail Party and my company being garlic lovers absolutely was astounded by the flavor combination and loved it. This is definitely a keeper and it is a nice refreshing change for a summer salad:-)",

Love the fresh flavor of the celery leaves with the richness of the garlic-oil. I preferred SEARING the scallops in a tsp. of the set-aside garlic/oil (I used a light EVOO) used the shrimp to deglaze pan (the little bit of juice in the shrimp worked nicely for deglazing)and then mixed all. I enjoyed it warm as well as chilled...maybe even a little more. Will be making this for company soon! Thank you Lillian for sharing this great recipe!",
