I also brined the pork to make it super super tender (only brine non-Kosher meat or meat that hasn't already been treated with salt - just check the label).  For 4 bone-in rib loin pork chops (12 ounces each), 1 1/2 inches thick, you will dissolve 3 tablespoons of salt and 3 tablespoons of sugar in 1.5 quarts of water in a container large enough to hold the meat.  You may need to add more water/salt/sugar in the same proportions until the meat is completely submerged.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.  Then remove the pork from the brine, rinse, and pat dry with paper towels.  The meat is now ready to be cooked.  Source: The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook",
