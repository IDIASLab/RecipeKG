I added a large clove of garlic minced a can of drained black beans and a large red pepper instead of green. I used the full 2 tablespoons of chili powder and did NOT drain the diced tomatoes. Maybe the person who said the result was soupy didn't drain the grease out after browning the ground beef with the peppers and onions. I used plenty of salt and pepper but still think next time I make it I will add some worchestershire sauce. Don't get me wrong it was more then edible; my son had 2 helpings! It just could have used a touch more zip. Thanks for a good base recipe...an update 11/12/08: If you are using a good brand of chili powder you may want to cut back to one tablespoon...the first few times I made this I used \"bargain\" chili powder (.99)and 2 tablespoons was fine...this last time I used McCormick's and 2 tablespoons made it a little too spicy for us. Oh also I used muenster cheese because that's what I had now THAT was good.",
