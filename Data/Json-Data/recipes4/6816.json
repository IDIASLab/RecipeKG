They are great for a Christmas or a holiday tray, a pot-luck, or just a nice treat with coffee any time of the year. Make sure to very finely chop the sweetened coconut, it only comes shredded. All of the ingredients are neccessary to hold the cookie together very well. I use parchment paper to avoid sticking and ease with clean-up. A cookie scoop, will also be neccessary to create the even mound shape and uniform baking. Feel free to double the recipe if neccessary, to get 3 dozen cookies. Thank you, for trying my cookie recipe.",

I used crunched Frosted Flakes instead of coconut worked great. Wonderful flavor and texture and easy to make. I didn't use a mixer just mixed them up by hand and cookie scooped them onto parchment. I think next time I will let them cool before rolling in sugar though. Thanks BW!",
