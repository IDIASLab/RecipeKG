After the chick peas are softened, use a potato masher and mash them a little bit.  Don't mash them all, just mash them so some get smushed.  This will thicken the sauce naturally.  Just let it simmer for a few minutes and it will thicken right up.  I also add 1 tsp. garam masala, 1 tsp. turmeric, 1 tsp. of cumin, 2tsp. salt, and a little bit of cayenne pepper (around a 1/4 tsp).  You can also use 1 tsp. of coriander if you like.  Garnish with fresh cilantro when serving.  We always use red onions and the tomatoes should be diced, not quartered like in the picture with the recipe.  I love this recipe.

Some day I will have to get lessons from someone who grew up cooking Indian.  Until then, I will have this recipe as one of my staples. Thanks for the delicious and easy recipe!",
