I did make a couple of changes, not sure that the recipe needed these tweaks but knowing my own tastes thought I should.  I doubled both the amounts of nutmeg and cinnamon, I used apple juice in place of the water and walnut oil in place of the vegetable oil.  So delighted with the finished cake.  I made one large cake instead of the 3 loafs the recipe states and cooked for 60 minutes, perfect!",

Also I didn't have any nutmeg so I used pumpkin pie spice (still used the cinnamon too though). Lastly I substituted orange-pineapple juice instead of the water for flavor & to give it a little citrusy note. All in all the flavor is very good; it's a like a lighter less intense less dense version of a pumpkin bread. I bet it would be really good with spice cake mix instead of yellow! Also I think it would be great with raisins currants and/or nuts added to it.",
