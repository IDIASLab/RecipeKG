I did not put in the pimentos because my daughter and grand-daughter wouldn't eat it with them. This is the one from now on. Thanks to Grandma Bee",

So I decided to try this one. I left out the pimentos added diced ham about 1 Tbsp of dried mustard and pepper to taste. I used 8oz. of sharp cheddar and 8 oz. mild because many of the recipes I looked at called for sharp. The cheese and soup did not mix well so I added 1/4-1/2 cup of milk. I might add a little more next time. Oh and I bought Progresso Bread crumbs instead of soda crackers and only used about 2 oz. I will make it MY way again! Thx Bee!!",
