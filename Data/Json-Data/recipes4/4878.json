There definitely was a preparation learning curve for me as far as stuffing the potatoes. When I finished, I had left over bread crumbs, beef filling, and too many eggs.  I used a mashed potato scoop, cut the potatoes in half, stuffed one side with the meat, added the other side and squeezed it into a ball.  My potato balls needed more meat stuffing, and next time, I will add filling to each half, and then press together to seal the potato balls.  Also, in the future, I will start with 2 eggs, and 1 cup of bread crumbs; you always can add more if necessary.  On the positive side, they tasted wonderful, and I definitely will make again.  I made these 3 days ago, froze them, defrosted today, deep fried this evening, and they turned out great.  One thing the recipe doesn't mention is hot sauce, and these potato balls always are served with hot sauce on the side, so be sure to put your favorite hot sauce on the table.  Thanks alu1977, these are the real deal!",

                "reviewBody": "Really good! I made a few minor changes. After adding the cube size potatoes to the water, I started sauteing the veggies with 1 tb of butter and 1 of oil. I used very lean beef (90% lean) to avoid excessive liquid. In addition to the paste, I added 2 tbl of spaghetti sauce and I substituted 2 tbl of red wine for the vinegar. I also added a sprinkle of mestique and omitted the cumin because we're not big fans of the stuff. The recipe does not yield enough mashed potatoes and too much meat. The first time I made it I had extra meat left over. I now use 9 medium sized potatoes with the 1 pound of beef. The recipe yields about 10 balls, not 12. (For those of you that complained the beef was bland, just keep adding the spices until it tastes to your liking. It has to be very flavorful to compete with the blandness of the potatoes. Make sure potatoes are salty enough, too.) When the potatoes were mashed and cooled, I formed 1 THIN patty of mashed potato, put 2 BIG tb of beef in the center and covered it with another thin patty of potato. I then formed a ball, rolled it in the flour, egg (only use 2 eggs), and bread crumbs. Oil must be VERY hot prior to putting the balls in. These are great to make ahead of time. When your ready, fry them and pop them in the oven @ 375 for 5 minutes. My husband and son LOVED them. And my Cuban parents were floored! Best compliment and well worth the effort. \u00a1Gracias!",
