The flavor was surprisingly wonderful and I'm glad I made a double batch. The chili can stand on its own without the coconut milk, but I found that adding the coconut milk gave it a subtle sweetness that added to the flavor profile.  The only addition I made was to thicken it with a cornstarch/ water mixture bc my husband likes thick chili.  This didn't detract from the overall flavor.  If you're not a fan of veggie chili, give this one a try.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.  I'll be making this recipe on a regular basis.",

Used 2 tsp. veg granules as I didn't have cubes.  I didn't have fresh green beans so added one can of rinsed green beans.  I had the crock pot on high per directions but after a couple hours, the liquid was almost boiling so I turned to low.  Initially, there doesn't appear to be much liquid in the chili but as it cooks, the veggies and/or beans must release some liquid as  there was liquid almost to the top after a few hours in the crock  pot.  I added the coconut milk which made the liquid a rather unappetizing color.  There was a little too much \"heat\" to the chili for my liking so if I were to make this again (not sure I will), I would probably cut back on the chili powder and/or red pepper.",

Last time I made it with the following variations: I doubled the recipe using a 7 quart Crock Pot. I added 3/4 jar of Pace medium picante sauce; and instead of chopping vegetables I used a tub of grilling veggies from the supermarket to save time chopping and half of a tub of chopped onions. I left out the green beans because I just wasn't feeling it. I thought the coconut milk was inspired! It was super delicious and I will definitely make sure again!",
