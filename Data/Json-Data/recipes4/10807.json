Also I think this recipe would be just as good if you used canned tomatoes. I used 1 can of Ro-Tel w/chiles that added a kick to the recipe and 2 tomatoes. Also I added whole med black olives w/ vege mixture. Lastly I used a verde cream of chicken soup it has chiles in it. I liked the extra kick but hubby thought it was too much. Other than that I will make this again. One last suggestion if you have leftovers add fresh chips to casserole after reheating and mix in. It makes a diffence.",
