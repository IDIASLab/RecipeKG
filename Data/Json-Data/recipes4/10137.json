I used shredded cheddar cheese and cream of chicken soup. Great alternative if you hate mushrooms. In place of the almonds on top I took 18 round crackers, crumbled them and add them too hot melted butter in a fry pan to soften them up. Add those to the top of your casserole and it adds a nice buttery flavor and they crisp back up in the oven. (Great way to get rid of that half stale package of crackers thats sitting in your pantry!)This recipe defaults at 8 servings. I only made a 4 serving dish so be sure to double the crackers if you try this method.",
