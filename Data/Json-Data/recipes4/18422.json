I made exactly as written and then added a bit more dijon to ramp up the flavor. One recommendation would be to get the gravy off the burner as soon as the dijon-mayo blend is incorporated. I left mine on a little too long and it ended up a bit lumpy rather than like a smooth gravy. The recipe doesn t say what size potatoes to use I used pretty good size russets and they absorbed all the water (none to drain off). Had some fresh dill in the fridge so I garnished with that (and that was a perfect choice!). I ve been making microwave lyonnaise potatoes for years and I do like what the dijonnaise brings to this side dish. Nice recipe BECCA it was good and thanks for sharing.",
