I could not find any bone in short ribs at the store so I bought some nice lean boneless beef short ribs. I also reduced the barbecue sauce to 3/4 cup.....just because my hubby is a healthy type II diabetic and we cut sugar where we can. I also braised these in the oven at a lower temp 275 for 5 hours. I like a long and slow braise on short ribs. I served these over fluffy mashed potatoes with a salad on the side and a nice pinot noir. These were absolutely melt in your mouth delicious. For those inclined to throw these in a slow cooker.....do NOT skip the browning steps. They are key to a richer flavored sauce and rib. Thanks Valerie. These are on my A+ list.",

This is great with homemade mashed potatoes. And be warned...your guests will eat 2X what they normally do so make a lot.\n\nThanks Valerie for a MAJOR winner...this should have a 10 star rating!",
