                "reviewBody": "Great recipe! I grew up with my mother making wonton soup on cold days.  One tip I can offer is boiling the wontons separately from the broth in just plain water, 3-5 min. The reason being, the wonton wrappers are dusted with flour and it can cloud the broth or slightly thicken it.  Wonton broth is supposed to be clear and thin. After boiling the wontons strain and add to the soup. If you want a more filling meal you can add egg noodles (refrigerated section of asian market) to the dish for wonton noodle soup. Boil noodles separately as well then add to soup. A little more work but so worth it!",

After I saw someone post this the first time I searched them out and lo and behold there was my recipe EXACT with I think one minor change.  I created this recipe from scratch and apparently the won ton company took it off of AllRecipes. It is too bad you give up all your rights to your recipes to AllRecipes once you post them. I am curious if All Recipes sold it or if anyone can just copy them? Anyhow, hope you are enjoying it :). UPDATE: for the person who said the sesame oil was too much... a few drops of sesame oil goes a very LONG way, too much sesame oil will ruin the recipe. For the entire pot of the soup just a few drops of sesame oil is all you need. Light hand with that!",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent! I love this soup it's my new favorite! I did make a few changes due to what I had on hand: I used mild Italian sausage casings removed. Therefor I didn't use the egg or salt and pepper (they didn't need it sausage is bound and seasoned already). This slightly changes the flavor of the wontons and I think I will try it again using only the ground pork. I also halved the recipe and further reduced the sesame oil which I find very pungent. I can still taste it (I'm eating this as we speak) and enjoy it but I think the full amount might be overpowering to me. As for assembling the wontons here are some tips: there is a learning curve...1tbsp of filling was way too much to try to squeeze in there I used a biggish tsp. and even then they are large to get in your mouth. Use VERY little water to moisten the edges or they just slide around. Stop caring about trying to make them pretty shapes and just do triangles if you're all thumbs like me. For those that aren't seafood lovers leave out the shrimp entirely instead of just not adding it to your own bowl...I can certainly taste the shrimp in the broth (which I love!). I didn't have the peas so I added extra greens from the bok choy. And extra green onions. Over all this is a delightful dish thanks for sharing! PS- thank you to the reviewer who advised boiling the wontons in their own pot...BUT if you do this step do not leave them sitting in a wire colander...they stick lol.",

                "reviewBody": "Oh My!  This was good!  I did substitutions based on what I had on hand.  I didn't have the Ground Pork, but I did have bacon bits (don't laugh, it worked!!!), so I used 1/4 cup bacon (any more than that and it would have been too salty).  In other recipes I saw on other sites, the broth was made using pork bones and shrimp shells, so I wrapped the bacon in cheese cloth and steeped it in the broth for 10 minutes.  I threw my frozen shrimp in the broth to defrost and pulled it out after about 5 minutes.  I also added 1 small knob of fresh ginger, sliced into 5 pieces, and let that steep for 45 minutes.  The broth ended up having a full, rich complex flavor that is amazing.  I then ran the bacon bits through my Magic Bullet to make the pieces less chewy and it gave it a great texture.  I coarsley chopped the shrimp, put it in the green onion and bacon mixture, and kept everything else the same, except I didn't need to add salt due to the saltiness of the bacon.  I found that I could barely fit 1/2 teaspoon of the mixture onto the wonton and still fold it without tearing.  As a result, I ended up with 50 wontons!!!  I also cooked the wonton's separate from the broth, then added them when done.  This ended up being a phenomenal comfort food!  Sure it took a while to make the wontons, but I sat and listened to good music while making them so it wasn't a chore!   Thank you, Starry Night for a wonderful base that can even be modified to what's on hand.  Now, back to my soup!!!",

That said I did make some changes. When making the won ton filling I add the shrimp to the won ton instead of the broth. Just our preference and it didn't get lost in the soup. I also added some dried garlic to the filling. To the broth I used both chicken and vegetable broth to add more flavour. I also added sliced ginger carrots and broccoli. Next time I will add slices of BBQ pork. We also cooked separately some long noodles and added them to the bowls before adding the won ton soup. Another reviewer stated that this recipe made a lot of won tons and its true. I froze mine on parchment paper before putting them into a container. I now have them on hand to make another batch of soup quicker. Will definitely make this again.",
