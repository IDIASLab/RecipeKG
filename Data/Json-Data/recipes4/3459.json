As written, I give it 3 stars, but with my changes, I think it's a 4 star recipe.  I added a handful of fresh cilantro and 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper for some kick.  I used low-sodium chicken broth and then added salt to taste (about 3/4 tsp).  I didn't have instant rice, so I added 1 cup regular rice about 1 hour before the chicken was supposed to be done.  I then served it with fresh chopped cilantro on top.  We loved the rice, but the chicken was DRY.  I think chicken thighs would be a much better option for this recipe.  The dark meat would stay more moist.  I will make this again with my changes and using chicken thighs!",

Had frozen boneless skinless chicken tenderloins on hand so that is what I used and will use again they came out tender and moist. It needs more seasoning which I will experiment with the next time I make it. I used brown rice because we cannot have the white. Maybe that took away from the flavor. It took 3 1/2 fresh squeezed limes to make the 1/3c needed. Will make this often. Thank you Lisa D for a great recipe.",
