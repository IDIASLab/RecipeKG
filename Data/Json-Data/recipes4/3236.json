I followed the recipe by spraying it with olive oil spray and I sprinkled on Tony Chachere's creole seasoning.  I baked it more than 10 minutes since we like our asparagus a little on the softer side.  After about 13 minutes I put it in a small baking dish and finely grated some white sharp cheddar cheese on top.  The oven was still warm so I popped it in and melted the cheese.  It was GREAT! ",

This could be seasoned with any number of herbs and spices but Hubs and I really liked the Cajun seasoning - it was something I never would have thought to use with asparagus and it worked well. Ten minutes in the oven was perfect, and freed me up to tend to other things while it was roasting. I garnished it with zested lemon which was the perfect complement.  Were it not for the cooking spray called for, I would have easily rated this 5-stars.",
