My wife was blown away by the results^_^  The chips turned out crispy and thin and even curled like many name-brand chips.  The only downside to this recipe is that you can't make many chips at one time. ...and after you taste them, you just can't seem to make them fast enough to meet demands.  \nMy change(s) to the recipe were to do away with the bag. (oil is messy and I can never seem to use one to evenly distribute seasonings)  For my chips I used extra virgin olive oil and poured it in the middle of the plate, then used the oil in the plate to dip both sides of the potato slices in as I spread them evenly on the plate.  Overlapping chips is not recommened, as they tend to be slightly \"chewy\" in the end compared to keeping them seperated.    My chips did not have any problems sticking at all except when I overcooked them.  For toppings I used seasalt, onion powder and cayenne. (I like things spicy hot) My wifes fav. was when I mixed freshly squeezed lime juice with the olive oil in the plate before dunking the potatoes, and then seasoned with seasalt and just a little kool-aid lemonade powder mix. (the kind without sugar added) The powder mix has citric acid in it which really gave the salty lime chips a nice Zzzzing!  Thank you for this wonderful Recipe idea!",

I didn't have a mandoline, so I used a potato peeler instead.  I thought it would take a long time with the peeler but I used 2 smaller red potatoes and it only took about 10 minutes of prep time.  After I oiled them up in the bag, I arranged the slices on top of the parchment paper in the circular pattern of the plate, with the tiniest bit of overlapping at the edges.  Once I did the first batch I realized that they stuck together where they overlapped and the chips took the shape of a doily!  Then I started expirementing with the next batch, with little criss-crosses and overlaps to create different looks.  The end result was about 6 (I think I ate one or two additional ones in the process) beautiful circular \"potato crisp doilies\"  which I served underneath a steak.  It was an absolute hit!",

I whipped some of these up for lunch (using the box grater slicer).  Super easy and delicious!  I too found they took more time (about 7-9 mins) even though my potatoes were really thin.  I used parchment paper directly on the turntable after I scorched my fingers trying to move the plate after the first round.  The parchment paper totally eliminated any sticking.  I just used olive oil and salt, but will try other seasonings and sweet potatoes in the future.  Thanks for a great recipe!",

It did however, take two failed batches before I had success. I sliced them paper thin the first time and followed the other directions, but at the last 'go round' in the microwave they burnt. You have to watch them VERY closely as even a few seconds too long will kill them. They were also stuck to the plate, but I figured that was because they were burnt. The second batch came out just in time, but again, were so badly stuck to the plate that they couldn't be salvaged. I would have given up but I like a challenge. The third time I sliced them a bit thicker and placed them on a sheet of parchment, forgoing the oil altogether. I also sprinkled the salt on before they went into the mike. Came out PERFECTLY that time!",
