That's why I love my slow cooker and this hearty winter dish is a favorite for all the family. Thick gravy and tender slow-cooked beef ideally served with mashed potatoes, cabbage, and some nice crusty bread to mop up. Great to prepare all the vegetables the night before especially if slow cooking.",
