First, I couldn\u2019t find canned lentils, so I bought a bag and because I was doubling the recipe, I estimated and used \u00bd the bag.  I soaked them overnight, then added some chicken broth and boiled them for 15-20 minutes.  Agree with previous reviewer....don\u2019t fry each veggie..just roast them all together!  If you don\u2019t have one already, get a mandolin \u2013 Pampered Chefs new one is GREAT!  I peeled the eggplant and sliced it up. Then sliced the Zucchini (didn\u2019t peel)  Beset change was that I used RED Potatoes, which I love anyway, but better yet, you don\u2019t have to peel! I put it all in a big roaster pan, coated them with Peanut Oil (can handle higher heat) and roasted them at 450-500 for 30-50 minutes (my oven cooks fast).  While they were cooking, I cooked up my onions and garlic added in the tomatoes, lentils, oregano and parsley and the cooked lentils.    (I took previous recommendation and added some cinnamon to this mixture)\nI layered 1/3 of this vegetables in the bottom of my 9x 13 pan, then \u00bd of the onion/tomatoes mixture, then sprinkled Feta Cheese.  Repeat (1/3 veggie, rest of onion/tomato/feta) then top with remaining veggies and feta.  Bake for 25 minutes.\nFor the B\u00e9chamel sauce \u2013 I added more cinnamon and some nutmeg to this and it made it perfect!  Since I had doubled the recipe, I doubled this sauce \u2013 but I only used \u00bd.\nI\u2019ve made twice since and am making it again his week for ",

I omitted the potatoes, however.  I also used a half a cup of dry lentils instead of the canned ones.  Of course I boiled them before adding them to the filling.\r\n\r\nThe only eensy weensy gripe I have about this recipie is that it was very crumbly and fell apart (which of course didn't affect the great taste) when serving.  When I was in Greece, I remember that Moussaka was very firm, and looked kind of like little pieces of cake.  I think I will try blending into a paste about half of the lentil filling with a little egg and flour, and then mix that with the rest of the filling.  That should make it stick together a little more.",

This was in the oven with less cleanup than any of the Rachael Ray 30 min recipes I've tried and was super super delicious! I will definitely make again! Thanks for the great addition to my collection! Update 3/1/08...second pan made came out even better than the first. I timed it and it was in the oven speedy fast in just over 1/2 an hour...I use a huge pan and cook a lot of the ingredients together then separate them while I'm doing my layers. I brought in half of the pan to work because I just couldn't eat it all...got rave reviews including one from a guy who claims to dislike anything made without meat. I'm so impressed with this recipe I've referred it to a bunch of people. YUM!",

I also used crumbled gorgonzola instead of feta and romano instead of parm, since those were all I had on hand, and it still turned out magnificent.  I personally think the use of the lentils in this dish is genius, and the bechamel sauce tied it all together beautifully.  I'm not sure what I did differently from other people, but mine was neither mushy nor crumbly; it was actually perfectly firm and easy to slice through and serve.  It really turned out outstanding.  I will definitely make this again the next time I have an extra few hours. :)",

Well he changed his mind after he tried it. He totally loved it and said that it tasted like it had meat in it and was just like the original. It took a lot of work though. I browned the eggplant in the oven and the zucchini and potato in a skillet on the stove and it went a bit faster that way. I think I could cut the time involved even further by slicing the zucchini and potatoes slightly thicker. Mine were paper-thin and not only did that make for a lot of slices to brown but also the zucchini became very soggy while some of the potatoes were too crisp. My only other complaint is that the moussaka was very liquidy as others have mentioned. Next time I'm going to drain the lentils before adding them to the tomatoes.",

I used Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar and I cooked dry lentils instead of using canned used dried parsley and I bought Israeli Feta from a deli smart balance instead of butter and Silk unsweetened soy milk instead of milk. This was phenomenal I did not miss the meat. My picky 14 year old said \"Hey this is actually pretty good!\" It kind of reminds me of lasagne.",

I also add more potatoes zucchini and lentils to fill up the 9x13 pan a bit better. I also grill the vegetables to avoid the use of oil. Smells delcious while cooking!",
