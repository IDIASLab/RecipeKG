I eat venison because my husband is a hunter but I've never cared for it much. Until this recipe that is. I took one bite just to taste it and ended up gobbling up the rest faster than I could take a picture. This will be my go to from now on. The only thing I might suggest is to go ahead and let it marinate overnight so that the ingredients have time to get acquainted. And, if you are sensitive to heat you might want to cut back on the red pepper flakes. Thanks for sharing Thorney!",

As soon as venison was almost done but not yet cooked all the way(still moist and soft in the skillet), I took it off and wrapped the cut up pieces of venison in pieces of bacon accordingly and put a toothpick thru each one. Put it on a foil lined cookie sheet and baked it at 400 for about 10 mins or so (I have a convection) until browned and crispy on the edges and it was soooo good. The bacon seems to put the fat into what\u2019s missing in the venison. Served with oven roasted asparagus and onions and my parmesan garlic red potatoes mashed my hubby adored ??????",
