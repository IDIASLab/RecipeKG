The flavor is lovely, and the texture is similar to a boudin blanc, or white hot dog, if you prefer. You can brown and serve these right after they're done boiling, but I like to make them ahead of time.",

I love brauts and so I wanted more flavor. I added 1 tbsp dried chopped red and green bell peppers, and some red chile pepper. Instead of sauteing them in butter to brown, I rolled them in egg and bread crumbs. Then I popped them into the air fryer for browning. They were crispy and SOOOO good. The men folk loved them. Next time, I will omit the salt and use garlic. Thank you for a great recipe.",
