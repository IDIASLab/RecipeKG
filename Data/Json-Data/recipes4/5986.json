Pudding can be altered to whatever flavor you like. We have only tried banana and chocolate. Before starting, have kids scrape all the cream off of the cookies as it will go in the mix. Place cookie halves in a resealable plastic bag and let the kids crush them. Double-bagging is preferred; kids tend to love smashing things so much the bag may get a few holes.",
