Omit the onion soup mix all together, it's just too salty and oniony. Plus I don't like mixing beef stock/bouillon and chicken stock/bouillon in the same recipe.  Added 1tsp of dried thyme leaves , one garlic clove minced and one bay leaf. Also used skinless bone-in chicken breasts because that's what I had. The bone-in def adds flavour \n\nTasted great and was perfect comfort food",

I used cream of chicken  and low sodium cream of mushroom and for water, I added broth from chicken I had canned. I added a bit of sriracha for my guys who love their food with  a little kick. Normally I add more seasoning initially but forgot. The fresh celery and onion however were plenty to give that added flavor. And I did use the lipton onion soup. It doesn't overpower the soup as some said  as long as there is enough liquid. 2 hours on high, it was done I was amazed. My intent was to let it simmer a while. It was perfect then but the real test is when the guys come home  ;). I will use this again. \n\nOh I added a few leftovers I had on hand - yellow rice, 2 small baked potatoes and small amount of squash/zucchini. Not needed for what I consider an already 5 star soup but  got carried away and  It only enhanced the recipe.\n\nI gave 4 rather than the 5 star because the recipe needs the extra liquid  and the addition of sriracha to give it a bit of zing",

The onion soup mix compliments the soup and does not overpower it. I'll definitely make this again. Couple of squirts of Sriracha brings it up to 5 stars.",
