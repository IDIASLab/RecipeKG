I should note that I didn't use the cheese because I'm lactose intolerant. Next time I make it I'll increase the bullion and turmeric and possibly put the lemon zest in a bit later. Since it was lacking a bit in flavor for me I squeezed a lemon wedge over it and added salt and pepper and that made it much better.",

I have one but didn't feel like using it. I made this stovetop in a chicken fryer (saute-type) pan. First I sauteed the onion in olive oi then added garlic and mushrooms and sauteed for only 1-2 min. Added spinach and cooked for about 2 min. Then added chicken artichokes turmeric chicken granules and a little lemon juice basil romano cheese and cooked rice and let simmer for a few min. At a reviewer's suggestion I also added about 1/2 tsp curry powder which really added to the flavor. I found this needed salt as well. I also added about 1/4 cup water to provide moisture and to prevent sticking. I guess I made this more into a stove-top casserole as opposed to a 'salad' as the recipe states. It was delicious though! I can see replacing the chicken with shrimp too. I didn't use the pine nuts or green onions.",
