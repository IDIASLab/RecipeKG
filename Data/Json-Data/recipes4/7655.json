                "reviewBody": "I was looking forward to this because of the ingredients. I should have read ahead because I started running into trouble right away. First of all, cooking the seafood for a total of twenty minutes (three steps) would lead to rubbery/tough scallops/shrimp so I seared the jumbo shrimp and jumbo scallops and reserved them then added them into the mixture the last five minutes to keep them tender. Against my better judgement I used the onion and garlic powders that the recipe advised. I should have gone with my instincts and used fresh basil, minced garlic and onion for better flavors. I was also confused by step 2 where they said to add the linguine into the shrimp mixture. Step 3 advises cooked linguine into bowls and then spooning shrimp/vegetable/sauce over the cooked linguine. Just a very confusing prep that did not justify the expensive ingredients. Overall, this turned out acceptable but I would not serve this to company.There are far better seafood pasta dishes that are easier to follow with better flavors for less money. Maybe this recipe needs a bit of editing",
