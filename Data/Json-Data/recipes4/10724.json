I will also try adding carrot and celery next time. I liked the subtle flavor and the way it made the whole house smell good. All in all this was a keeper.

From then on I: - put frozen chicken breasts in and diced them later. - added a can of green beans - added some garlic - added sliced carrots - added some frozen peas I had - added parsley rosemary savory salt and pepper - all to taste. After cooking for 6 hours it was ready to serve. It was delicious 5 star material. Looking back the only thing I might change would be to add the rice later on as it had all but turned to a mush. But on the other hand it added to the overall thickness of the soup which I enjoyed. I think if you make the alterations as I have you'll find this soup to join your list of favorites!",
