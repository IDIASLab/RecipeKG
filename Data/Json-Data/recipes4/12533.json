I don't use the paneer; instead I bake or saute extra firm tofu (16 oz package) and then put this in near the end of the cooking time. Also I usually double the veggies and triple the sauce so it doesn't dry out too much (wonderful w/basmati or naan). The addition of cilantro is nice (if you like it) as well as a pinch of sugar. I plan to try brown sugar next time. Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!",

It still had a \"bite\" to it and several of my guests found it a little too spicy for them. Next time I may cut the cayenne down a bit further. Be sure to use golden raisins - I used dark raisins and they looked like bugs mixed in! I added some cauliflower flowerettes like my favorite Indian restaurant does. That restaurant also adds a little fresh cilantro which I'll add next time since I love cilantro. I couldn't find garlic paste and ginger paste so I just used fresh minced garlic and fresh minced ginger. Thanks for the recipe!",

To save time(and just 'cause I was lazy)I used frozen mixed vegetables and I cubed the potato into pea sized pieces(as per other reviews) cooking it in oil before adding the onion. Reduced the cayenne. No nuts in my cupboards no problem!! Great even without. No paneer either....just added extra veggies. Next time I will make sure to have cashews and paneer on hand though. The raisins were a great touch. There were just enough in the dish to leave me wanting more. Also I used part yogurt and part cream instead of milk and cream. I will be making this again and again!

There is another vegetable korma recipe that I use at home which I really like but it's not quite perfect. So when I saw this one I was very excited! Unfortunately my husband and I were disappointed. We did not include the paneer since the grocery stores near us did not carry it. I also only used 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne for our 6-year old's sake. I still thought the hotness was disproportionate to the other spices. We couldn't taste any of the nice flavor from the turmeric etc. This dish was not bad I just didn't think it was that great either. This didn't seem to taste much like the navratan korma we order at Indian restaurants. We probably will not make this again and will continue to look for a good authentic korma recipe.",
