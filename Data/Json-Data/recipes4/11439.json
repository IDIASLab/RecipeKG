I'm amazed that it got so many good reviews considering that there is either half as much liquid or twice as much rice as needed for it to turn out. I adjusted my liquids and followed the rest of the recipe. The flavors are good - I like the curry and ginger, but also thought it could use a little sweetness and/or more coconut flavor. Thanks!",
