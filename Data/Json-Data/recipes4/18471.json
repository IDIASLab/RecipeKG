I topped the mini-bundt cakes with Mario s Coconut Lemon Curd (and then garnished with some coconut shreds) and used that as a filling for the cupcakes as well (recipe on this site). The undrained crushed pineapple made the cakes so moist and with the addition of the coconut extract this really does taste like pina colada. So easy so tasty and nothing to change on this recipe. It s simply good!",
