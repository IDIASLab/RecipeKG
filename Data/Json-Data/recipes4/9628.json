I used baby bella mushrooms- about a cup and used roughly 4 tbs butter in a saucepan and sauted two garlic cloves the mushrooms and 1/4 cup of onions in it. Then I added 1/2 cup of sherry. Let that simmer and then added the shrimp. I cooked the shrimp for a couple minutes removed it and then added about 1/4 cup of flower and 1/2cup of milk. I think next time I cook it I'll used cornstarch instead. I had to add a bit of salt but it was very tasty. I also served it over instant rice.",
