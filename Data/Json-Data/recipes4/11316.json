I have been lazy before and added the green chiles while the soup is cooking--gives better chile flavor to the soup. Then before serving I stir in the sour cream to make the soup creamy instead of swirling. I never can eat just one bowl. I like adding chopped cilantro to the sour cream to add another flavor twist. I have made double batches and have frozen the leftovers. Other addition ideas: sauteed onion corn. I think it is great without even adding the green chilies for a different soup. What a hit at a 10 person Thanksgiving Dinner.",

The spices suggested are in too pale a dose to create the changes you need. It will still rate a \"Ick\" Kick them up by doubling and tasting until you get the effect you like. I went spicer than usual because I used the sour cream to cool it down. milk cuts hot peppers burn I also added the chilie peppers to the pumpkin instead of the sour cream. Garnish with parlsey or other herb leaf for that green look. Red Pepper Flakes can be used instead of Chili powder but BE CAREFUL. You could blast your tongue off. Instead of garlic powder use a good garlic and herb seasoning. Put that in first and taste until it is acceptable. Used Franks Hot Sauce. Spicy mix that even the leery one in the family liked. might try it with rice or beans mixed in next.",
