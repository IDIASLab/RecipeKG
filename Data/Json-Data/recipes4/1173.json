A lot of reviewers had trouble with the crumb topping not sticking.  So, I dipped the salmon in a beaten egg then covered ALL sides with the crumb mixture.  Half a recipe of the crumb mixture was plenty to cover 4 salmon filets.  I got the sauce started simmering (didn't change a thing there).  Then I heated 2 Tbsp. olive oil in a separate skillet on medium-high heat and browned the salmon, flipping so all sides were brown.  Then I placed the browned salmon in the sauce to finish cooking for about 15 minutes.  I served it over brown rice with a side of mixed veggies.  I was questioning the use of teriyaki sauce, but I put it in and it was delicious!",
