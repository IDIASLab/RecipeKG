To fix the flavor after tasting the filling mixture, I looked up other shawarma recipes and ended up adding cumin, paprika, turmeric, cayenne, cinnamon, dry mustard powder, garlic, and tahini.  I served with shredded lettuce, red bell pepper matchsticks, and sour cream though if I'd thought ahead I probably would have gone with cucumber, tomato, etc.  Delicious after the many changes, but in the end the only thing that remained from the original recipe was the cooking method.",
