I had a box of yellow cake mix and cream cheese frosting that were expiring, so I put those two ingredients into allrecipes.com and this was the only recipe that came up.  It looked interesting, so I picked up the rest of the ingredients, and it was a huge hit with our guests!   It is moist and tasty.   I felt the coconut and pecans added the best flavor, and would not recommend omitting them.    Thank you for the recipe!",
