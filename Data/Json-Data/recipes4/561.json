I put in 1 can of each....cream of celery potato and mushroom. I also cut up small carrots and sprinkled with parsley for color and presentation. I did not add any salt even to the instant rice due to all the salt in all the soups and it was just right. I rubbed the tenderloin with garlic/lemon/pepper seasoning very generously. This is a definite keeper!!! Thanks for sharing the recipe and all the \"tips\". Oodles_OR",

I used a can of cream of celery a can of cream of chicken and half a package of dry onion soup mix with a cup of water - I wanted to make sure there's lots of gravy especially with the roast being larger. I mixed the soups soup mix and water together poured it over the roast and.... Now I'm waiting to see what happens.:) I also put a few handfuls of baby carrots in the slow cooker. My plan is to serve this over egg noodles. I'll add to my review tonight... I was concerned that the gravy would be too salty but it doesn't appear to have been! The carrots turned out awesome and the gravy was great. I thickened it with some cornstarch to give it the gravy consistency. It was so good and the leftovers were good for a few days! Thanks so much for the recipe!",
