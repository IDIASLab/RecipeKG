I was also excited to find whole wheat lasagna noodles. As I was layering I ended with noodles and topped those with mozzarella - then had second thoughts and used a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes that I had on hand to top the noodles before adding the last of the cheese. I brought this to work and the boys LOVED it! Ben said he couldn't believe he was eating vegetables - lol! - in reference to the Swiss chard. Chris asked if there was enough for seconds (= I did think about draining the tomatoes but I thought the noodles needed the extra liquid. Apparently not. My only complaint about this was that it was very soupy )= Not sure how I will try to fix this next time. Maybe drain one of the cans of tomatoes. Or maybe use tomato sauce in place of one of the cans of tomatoes. I'm sure I will make it again but I will try to thicken the sauce somehow next time. Five stars for flavor and method. Three stars for the watery sauce.",

                "reviewBody": "Recipe Group Selection: 26, January 2013 ~ Making this recipe was the first time for me using Swiss chard and flat-leaf parsley. This is one of the reasons I enjoy participating in RG \u2013 it takes me out of the box with trying new ingredients. After reading Heather and gammaray(= reviews, I was a little worried about the \u201csoupiness\u201d of the recipe. So with that in mind I used 1 (28oz.) can of diced tomatoes and 1(14.5oz.) can of tomatoes and 2 fresh tomatoes. I kept all the other ingredients at the listed amounts. After washing the Swiss chard and the parsley, I spun out the water in the salad spinner. I assembled the recipe as listed but cooked it on high for 1 \u00bd hours and turned it to low for 1 \u00bd hours. I then cooled it completely and put it in the fridge overnight. Today, it cut in beautiful slices and reheated very well in the microwave. I think if I had let it rest about 20 minutes before dishing up when it was hot, it would have held its shape nicely. I think cutting out the additional 14.5oz. of tomatoes with juice and adding fresh tomatoes instead really helped. I made this in my 6qt. round crock-pot and it was almost to the top before heating.  After cooking it was between \u00bd and \u00be\u2019s full. It serves a lot more than 6 servings. I could also make a meat lasagna (DH's favorite) using this recipe as the cooking times worked great for me and the noodles were perfectly cooked. Make sure to spray the inside of the crock-pot with cooking spray for quick and easy clean up.",

I used a jar of sauce instead of the tomato mixture called for in the recipe and added 1 lb sauteed beef to it. I also chopped the chard and added grated zucchini to it. I also added 1/2 jar of sauce on the top before the last layer of mozarella. I cooked it for 1 hour on high then 2 hours on low. Turned out perfect not too watery or dry. Only change I would make next time is to add more cheese both ricotta and mozarella because the last layer was a little skimpy.",
