I caught 12 bass with the help of my dad, who came down there after he played guitar at the trading post. It was 7:00 when I brought them all back to camp and thought to eat them since everyone already ate dinner while I was gone. So I fried them up in some crushed chips leftover from lunch.

Topped it with Avacado Mango Salsa (also on this site) and it was so delicious with the perfect crunch - great idea with the potato Chips!

Never the less we served the dish with rice (cooked in half chicken broth and half water) and sprinkled lemon on the rice. We also sliced the Bass into 2-3 inch slices used 2 eggs and combined all of the dry ingredients except for the cayenne pepper. We put the cayenne pepper on the fish while it was frying. Lastly instead of using bread crumbs we crushed high-end stuffing that added a lot more taste and texture. This was an EXCELLENT dish and I can't wait to thank my dad for catching the bass for me!:)",
