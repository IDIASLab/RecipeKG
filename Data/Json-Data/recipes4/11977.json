Cook directly on rack for 7 more minutes or until crust is golden and cheese is browned. \n\nAnother hint...\n1 - be sure to oil the dough liberally, this keeps it from crusting over which will make your stretch more difficult. \n\n2 - You only get one chance to stretch it. Do not punch down dough or knead it after it rises or you will have to roll it. It does not have the same texture when rolled. Just pick it up and let it fall over your fists or widely stretched fingers until it starts to get thin. Then lay on an oiled cookie sheet dusted with corn meal. \n\nMy favorite toppings are:\nalfredo sauce\nblack pepper\ngarlic powder\nfresh leaf baby spinach\nbaby bella mushrooms\nblack olives\nsliced roma tomatoes\ncooked chicken chunks\n\nYUM!!! \n ",

I use crushed tomatoes usually.  This is a phoenomenal recipe!01/13/11 UPDATE:  I decided last minute to make this yesterday for dinner last night.  I had 4 hours.  I made the dough adding about 1/4 cup semolina for a little of the bread flour and adding a pinch of sugar to the yeast mixture.  I left on the counter to rise for about an hour then moved to the garage (very cool there!) and left for 2 hours before bringing back to the kitchen for the last hour to warm up.  It turned out fantastic.  While the flavor may not be quite as full as an overnight rest, it's possible to make this same day and still have the same great crispy-chewy texture and very good flavor.  DH said last night's was the best crust ever in fact!  This recipe truly makes a superior crust.",

DON'T wimp out and use the dough the same day... it will taste MUCH more authentic if you follow the directions as given... it can even go a little longer than 16 hours without a problem.  Be sure to preheat your stone and oven for at least an hour... and to make the \"brick oven\" experience even better, I have a second stone on the rack above so that heat is generated from the top, too.  Thanks for this great recipe!",

I like most made certain changes to the dough to accomdate our needs: I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and one of all purpose (high gluten bread flour would have been to tough with the WW). I also mixed a teaspoon each of granulated garlic and mixed italian spices into the dough -- gives the dough a real nice twist. Also did a 50/50 mixture of hand-grated mozzarella and parmesan with a drizzle of EVOO at the end. The guests LOVED it; hope this helps -- enjoy.",

My boyfriend has always said he likes whole wheat but whole wheat pizza is awful. He LOVED this and said I could make it anytime! I image it's even tastier with just white flour. It's great to know all the ingredients going into your food and make something like this from scratch. I do not have a Pizza Peel and had some trouble getting the pizza from my cutting board to the hot stone. On my second one I ended up putting the dough on my stone after I stretched it out and assembling the pizza on the hot stone. I'm not necessarily recommending this but it was a lot easier than when I tried to place the completed pizza on the stone. Also I cooked mine at 400 for a longer time because I wasn t sure my stone could handle 550.",
