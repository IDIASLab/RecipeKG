I did defeat the purpose of the title by leaving out the jalepenos because I don't care for them in a sandwich. I used white bread as it was what I had. I had all the ingredients but the avacado so I had to leave that out. I probably doubled the tomato and cut the amount of green pepper and onion in half for personal preference. I loved how the dressing was light and not a heavy mayo. I used white wine vinegar. For the cheese I used Cabot 50% low fat cheddar. I made an olive tapenade the other day and used about an equal amount of that instead of opening another can of olives. Thanks for helping me use up some of my bits of veggies in the fridge and make them taste good to.",
