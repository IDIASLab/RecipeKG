The prosciutto I buy is quite thin but rather large and I soon discovered that there was WAY too much proscuitto for each spear - it was way too salty it overwhelmed the taste of the asparagus and it took so long to crisp up that the asparagus got soggy. We much prefer it when I just use a very thin ribbon of proscuitto per spear or better still use the 'Prosciutto Wrapped Asparagus' recipe on this site which uses a thicker ribbon of proscuitto and a little blob of cream cheese per bundle of spears.(For 5 stars simmer the spears in boiling salted water 'til they turn bright green immerse in iced water then proceed with the recipe. It will stay beautifully crisp and green)",

I used a whole slice of prosciutto...I read where only using half would could down on the satiness. Might go that route next time. My asparagus was rather thin in diameter..so that could be another reason. The last few minutes I popped them under the broiler...just to make sure they were crispy. Almost went with Taylor's suggestion to add Parm....but dedcided against it at the last minute! We enjoyed these and thankx for sharing your recipe.",
