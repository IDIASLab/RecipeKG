It was tender and delish but I think it could have been a little more tender so next time I will cook on low all day about 8 to 10 hours.

Glad I did.  The steaks came out amazingly tasty.  I still sprinkled with Season All, baked at 350 for about 15-20 minutes.  Then covered with sliced onion and a mixture of 1 cup Sweet Baby Rays and water (did not have ketchup).  I continued to bake, uncovered, for another hour or so.  The meat just fell apart.  The onions were so good.  Next time I will slice up about 3 onions.  I basted the onions and exposed steak with the sauce a couple of times.  My husband could not stop raving.  This is a keeper!",

Whatever it was 16oz of liquid was enough to cook it in. Rather than using a cup of ketchup I used an 8oz can of tomato sauce and mixed in about 1T brown sugar 1T vinegar 1/4t cinnamon 1/4t dry mustard a of pinch allspice and a pinch of cloves. (Essentially a ketchup recipe except with tomato sauce instead of tomato paste.) I then used the can to add 8oz water put in the onion and let it cook away. Every half hour or so I used a pair of tongs to rotate it. About three hours later I took out the meat removed the fat and bone tore the pork into chunks and served with with the sauce over gnocchi. It was tender and flavorful and quite easy to make.",
