Also I made sure there was enough water to cover my ham hocks/sausages (I also used two packages of portuguese sausage (not linguica it falls apart to easily) as the sausage is the flavoring for the soup. I like that you added stewed tomatoes gotta have that!! As for the macaroni that should not be optional the cabbage actually could be optional. And remember cabbage soaks up your liquid so you may have to add more water during the simmering processes. I drained my kidney beans to take out some of the sodium but thats not necessary. All in all this is a great hearty soup with or w/o cabbage; with or w/o macaroni pasta. (if your gonna add the pasta for this recipe a couple of handfuls is all you'll need. if u add the whole bag or 1-lb it will soak up all your liquid and you definitely do not want that to happen). Thanks for this recipe! YUMMY",

When I make this at home I use less water because we enjoy it more like a stew. The only the sausage changes as you move around Portugal.

I can't eat pork so I did replace ham hock with smoked turkey leg and linguica sausage with spicy chicken adouille sausaged. Even with these modifications though it was the broth that makes this whole dish. Thank you so much for sharing and bringing me back to sweet home memories!",
