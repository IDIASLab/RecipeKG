I am Irish (born there) so am missing cabbage and had to try this on today St. Patricks Day ;) I altered the recipe some by just shredding the cabbage and boiling it. I fried oh maybe 6 slices of American bacon and totally trimmed the fat, added some slivers of yellow onion fried crisply and tossed these both on the drained cabbage. I added salt and pepper (NO vinegar) and some melted IRISH butter (Kerry gold) and then broiled as recommended. It was absolutely delicious! I served with roast chciken and yellow rice! Definitely will make agaiN!",

Everyone enjoyed it and I liked it so much that I am saving the recipie to incorporate into our regular diet and to modify for future dishes (going to see if the same recipie works well with brussle sprouts...could be fun!)",
