I have been making it for several years now and I have perfected it for my family. I add a slightly beaten egg and parmesan cheese to the ground beef mixture use ground up butter crackers to bind it all together use beef broth in place of water golden mushroom soup instead of beef and mushroom soup and top it off with sauteed fresh mushrooms. Browning the steaks in butter over medium high heat (to get a nice brown without cooking it all the way through) then placing in baking dish pouring the gravy over them and baking uncovered at 300 to 325 for about an hour makes the best most flavorful juicest beefy steaks but I have also just put the raw patties in the baking dish and covered with gravy and baked uncovered at 350 for about an hour. Serve with mashed potatoes and green beans or corn on the cob. Delicious!",
