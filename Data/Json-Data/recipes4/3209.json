I scaled the recipe to accommodate a huge can of crushed tomatoes that I needed to use up (hence my search for a tomato sauce recipe). Although I doubled the recipe and still added extra tomatoes (64 ounces instead of a mere 56) it had a lot of bite. Yet I can't stop eating it and my husband who doesn't crave spicy foods likes it too and says it is not too spicy. This is a good sauce in which to add those things that you want to get rid of. I added a rind from a wedge of romano cheese and let it simmer quite a while. And as good as it is I had some heavy cream that needed to be used up so I added 7 ounces of heavy cream to a double recipe of this sauce. Very good and I imagine it will be even better with pasta!",

I did do some doctoring in addition to the recipe ingredients I added some fine chopped carrot about 1/2 cup red wine and a packet of beef boulion in place of salt. I also added some sugar about two tablespoons to cut the acidity and sweeten a bit. Delicious. Good-bye jarred sauce!",

                "reviewBody": "Good as far as it goes. If you can get away with it use tomato sauce and simmer it longer the longer the better adding water if you need to. As others have said a bit of tomato paste will thicken the sauce but make it even more acidic and bitter. So... Add a pinch of baking soda. IMO sugar is not a good idea because it doesn't solve the acidity. It only masks it (and does so badly). Instead do what my sainted grandmother used to do. Add a pinch of baking soda just as the sauce begins to simmer and stir the foam back in. Bases counteract acids. Cook awhile and add a little more baking soda if necessary. (Taste first.) That step will allow the natural sweetness of the tomato to assert itself. Don't overdo the baking soda though. It will make the sauce unacceptably salty. Oh and leave out the salt if you use bs.",

So I omit the crushed red pepper flakes & for those of us that do like it spicy we sprinkle it on top of our separate dishes. I also added meat sausage & meatballs. I brown the sausage first before letting them cook in the sauce. Because I triple the recipe I actually have to bake my meatballs in the oven due to not having a big enough pot. Because I added meat the sauce came out a tad watery so the next time I drained the juice from the diced tomatoes & that seemed to help. Overall an excellent sauce great for my entire family. It has become a staple in our household & every I make homemade sauce this is the recipe. It also cooks well in the crockpot.",
