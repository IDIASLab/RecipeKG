I used a cream cheese frosting that included butter cream cheese & homemade powdered sugar (because it is corn free. Next time I would experiment by adding a little crushed pineapple but as this recipe stands it is fantastic. As for the complaint that this cake is too salty or dense you could decrease the salt to 1 tsp. or eliminate all together and increase the baking soda to 2 tsp. The cake is dense because of the lack of flour. You could also very easily turn this recipe into a bar pan recipe. I also dusted the top with crushed walnuts. Enjoy!!!",

After thinking about the frosting and not wanting to use dairy I decided to try some major modifications. I made an apple cake instead using the amounts listed but only using the almond flour celtic sea salt baking soda eggs and grapeseed oil. I substituted plain apple sauce for the agave nectar. Apple sauce was also the \"icing\". I used Fugi apples. It turned out great! It was moist and had a good flavor. I got multiple requests for the recipe. I will definately try the carrot cake down the road.",
