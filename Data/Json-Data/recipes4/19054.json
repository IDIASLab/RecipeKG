The only real change I made was instead of bouillon I used unsalted chicken stock as that's what I had on hand. If you do this you might want to add a little salt as bouillon usually contains sodium but I forgot and the recipe still came out great following the directions as written! Also the recipe doesn't specify what kind of rice to use but I went with medium grain. We really enjoyed this recipe and look forward to making it again. Thanks for the recipe!",
