Cook the skillet contents first before adding it to the eggs and only use a little more than half of the package.  Also, I figured there would be enough seasoning in that that I wouldn't have to add the garlic powder,black pepper, and salt, but I was wrong.  If You use the Skillet package, You should add the garlic powder and pepper, but no salt.  Anyways, these are amazing if You follow the recipe exactly too! Who would have thought to bake eggs in cupcake liners.  This recipe is a keeper!  :)",

After months of frozen pancakes and waffles this egg-muffin was met with rave reviews!!  Since the meals are made 8 hours ahead reheating was a major concern.\r\n\r\nThis recipe works very well for making ahead and reheating in the microwave.  If you have a 700W micro reheat for 1 minute 30 seconds and let rest 30 seconds before eating.  If you have a 1100/1200W micro reheat for 1 minute 10 seconds and let rest 30 seconds before eating.  If at all possible reheat in a dish covered with waxed paper so that steam builds up.\r\n\r\nTry \"HOT\" flavor sausage for a change also mix it up with different additions.  I've added chopped sweet red pepper, cubed fresh bread, several different types of chees (Swiss, Gruyere, Fontina, manchego).  Winter squash puree (butternut) and asparagus are also great additions!!",

I made these in silicone cupcake liners sprayed with Pam and just lined them up on a cookie sheet, using a soup ladle to fill them. I used bacon rather than sausage, fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder and 1/4 c. finely chopped red pepper rather than green (the green pepper is in the directions but not in the ingredients list!), which gave these such nice color. There's a lot of room for creativity and versatility in terms of ingredients - ham, sausage, crab meat, salmon, different cheeses or vegetables, herbs - the possibilities are really limitless. They're delicious, although how could they not be? Cute and colorful too - they rise up puffy and tall and get a nice, golden sheen to them. I don't know that I'd bother with these little guys for a whole bunch of people because it would just be too putzy, but for just Hubs and me it was a special little treat on the plate this morning!",
