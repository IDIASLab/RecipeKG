The eggs still do spread out to fill the whole pan but if you wait for them to cook a little you can smoosh/ fold the eggs into piles and make nice looking egg foo yung patties. The sauce needs a lot of seasoning help IMHO. I added some garlic and a dash of honey and liked it much better that way.",
