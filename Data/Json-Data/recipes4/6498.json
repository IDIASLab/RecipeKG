We all enjoyed this for dinner and I would like to try it again with a different noodle choice. Maybe angel hair pasta or cut spaghetti. The red pepper flakes were lost in the recipe. If you like 'heat' I would use half mozzarella cheese and half pepper-jack cheese. Good solid recipe with room to play.",
