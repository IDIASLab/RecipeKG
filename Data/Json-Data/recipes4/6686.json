After baking, while waiting for the cake to cool, I microwaved 1/2 a container of Pillsbury sugar free Chocolate Fudge frosting for about 30 seconds, stirred until slightly melted, then drizzled it over the warm cake.

I found basic cake recipe that I store in my pantry to add to any box mix to bring up the net weight so I can use recipes like this one. Because this recipe uses a chocolate mix, I added a rounded Tablespoon of Hershey's dark chocolate cocoa powder. I read so comments that this recipe misses a \"wow factor.\" So I did what my chef taught me to do: add salt (about 1/2 teaspoon). I also used a strong brew of instant coffee, and a generous squeeze of pancake syrup (roughly 3 Tablespoons). I dumped everything (less the chocolate chunks) into a bowl and mixed on high speed with a handmixer. It didn't take long to incorporate and become thick. I then folded in the chocolate chunks. I highly recommend using Baker's Joy  No-Stick Baking Spray with Flour to prep your cake pan. I allows the cake to slip out effortlessly after cooling. Bottom line: I will be making this again.",

I couldn't find a 18.25 oz box of cake mix - darn those manufacturers for shrinking everything! - so I actually bought a second box and added additional mix so that I got to the correct amount. The cake didn't look like anything special but it was so moist and chocolately people were amazed. I dusted it with confectioners sugar at the end just to make it look a little prettier.
