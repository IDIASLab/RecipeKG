Tender, fluffy and light, these are equally as good warm with butter as they are without.  This recipe, unlike the other, did not call for any sugar - I didn't miss it, so why add it? Rather than shortening I used cold butter from the fridge and grated it into the flour with a box grater.  That made quick work of blending it!  I do have self-rising flour, but I was too lazy to dig it out from the pantry.  A cup of all-purpose flour mixed with 1-1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1/4 tsp. salt did the trick.  I did NOT knead for two minutes - just a few turns is what I did, because I did not want to overwork the dough.  I swear, THAT and buttermilk, are the secrets to a fine biscuit! Once again, I regrettably only made a half recipe. Thankfully, another half recipe can be mixed up in a jiffy! Note: I was also too lazy to dig out my rolling pin and roll them out.  Patting the dough out with my fingers seemed to work just fine.",
