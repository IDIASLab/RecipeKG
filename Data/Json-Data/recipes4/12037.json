First, I added 1/4tsp. Cayenne Pepper to \"kick it up a notch\".  Then I added 1/2 cup sour cream (yummy).  And I made sure that the 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese was sharp!  That added so much more flavor.  Excellent recipie. Would make again and again.",

It tasted great--I loved the combination of vegetables plus I added a couple of carrots and substituted frozen chopped spinach. My only other additions were salt pepper and the tabasco that I add to all cheese soups. The texture of mine turned out crappy though but I'm pretty sure it's because I didn't have enough potatoes. I'd already started putting it together before getting out the potatoes and I maybe had 1 1/2 pounds so the cheese had nothing to stick to but itself. Despite that debacle everybody loved it and I will definitely try again!",
