I made changes to this and have saved it as my favorite unstuffed (low carb friendly) cabbage recipe. I sauted onion and garlic and used 2lb hot italian sausage/hamburger mix and browned it before adding to the pot. I added a cup of tomato sauce 1 1/2 teaspoons of splenda and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. When the concoction was close to done I turned up the heat and removed the lid on the pot to reduce the moisture but not overboil the leaves. I'll make it this way forever.
