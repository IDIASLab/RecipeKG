Having a craving for these once again I made these and turned out great. I only added a dash of cayenne pepper and I don't bother with the oven part. If you wait until the sauce has thickened you can add the eggs then heat through and serve over toast. Very tatsy. Even my boyfriend who almost refused to eat these had a bite which lead to two servings later. Thanks!",
