Even though the directions did not require this step I lined my loaf pan with foil and allowed the edges to overhang. The amount of milk is not given but I used about 1/3 cup. I used ground chuck and after mixing I placed the beef mixture into the refrigerator and allowed to sit about 7 hours. I removed from the refrigerator and lifted the meat out and sliced. After browning the slices on both sides for about 3 minutes I placed the meat slices in a 9 x 13 baking dish and poured the soup with extra mushrooms over the meat. I added 1 Tablespoon of Gravy Master (to make the gravy more brown in appearance). The teaspoon of salt added to the meat is not necessary as the soup had plenty. I baked for about 45 minutes uncovered. Husband and I both rated 3 1/2 stars but rounded to 4. Thanks for sharing Ashli113!",

I doubled the recipe, so that there would be enough to send w/ hubby to work for lunches, b/c this kind of dish is right up his alley, lol. I still only used 1 onion (med.-lg. size). I wasn't sure on the milk b/c the amount isn't listed, so I just eyeballed it until the mixture felt right (maybe 2/3 cup, or so). I did not shape this into 1 loaf, just formed the patties (got 8 out of a double recipe), and put them in the fridge overnight, as stated. After searing them, and putting them into the baking dish, I sauteed an 8oz. package of sliced mushrooms in a little evoo (we love mushrooms) w/ salt, pepper and garlic powder, mixed that w/ the soup, and put it over top the meat. This had such a great flavor, for the minimal amount of ingredients called for! Served w/ mashed potatoes and peas. Simple, delicious, and a HUGE hit @ dinner tonight...A definite keeper~YUM!

I couldn't decide whether to cover this as it cooked in the oven or not and ended up not covering it. I think it would have left a little more 'gravy' from the soup if I had. I liked the flavor hubby (surprisingly!)did not. Seems like an awful lot of work for something this simple. I would rather have more flavor in the meat make meatloaf burgers and fry with a little milk gravy made afterwards. Thanks for the recipe.",

I did add lots of Lawry Black Pepper Seasoning Salt (2 teaspoons at least) & some worchestshire sauce (about a tablespoon or so) to the burger mix as we like lots of flavor. We thought it was really good. I think it would be pretty bland without any extra seasonings. If you are looking for lots of \"gravy\" then I would add another can of mushroom soup on top. We had baked potatoes so had no need for extra one can of soup was perfect. Will be making this again for sure!!",

First tweak: I used deer meat rather than hamburger; 2nd tweak: my saltine crackers were Alabama Fire Crackers from AR that I needed to use up; 3rd tweak: I subbed cream of onion soup for the mushroom soup as they don t care for mushrooms. I followed the rest of the instructions made it the day ahead browned in the skillet and then topped with soup to bake. It didn t say rather to cover it or not so I didn t. This was served with long grain and wild rice toss salad and bread. The final results my guys LOVED this recipe! ashli113 thanks for sharing your recipe I know I will be making this one again for them.
