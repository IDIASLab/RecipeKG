(I needed to adjust the recipe since I only had 8 blossoms and I found that I needed to add 2 teaspoons of water to the automatically converted amount to make the batter the right consistency.) This would be a good fritter dough if it's not blossom season. This is a great way to use up all the male blossoms on your zucchini plant. YUM!\n(Both female and male blossoms grow on a zucchini plant. The fruit grows from the female blossom and the male is fruitless, which makes it ideal for cooking with.)",
