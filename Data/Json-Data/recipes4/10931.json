However I think it would be better if next time I make sure to use red beans and either smoked or spicy sausages to give it a bit of a kick. I cut the recipe in half and it fed 4 of us next day too! Definitely will make again!!!! Also I think more veggies would be an added bonus!:)",

I'd ad more next time just cause it complimented the cabbage so well. Great way to use one of the cabbages I caught at the St. Patrick's Day parade and different from coleslaw or cabbage salad. The ketchup gave it a surprisingly yummy and different flavor as did the vinegar. I'd like to try apple cider vinegar instead of white. Also I used a 13-qt. pot and it filled it to the brim which didn't surprise me. Thanks for a truly slamming recipe!",

I had the same feelings about beefuna burgers and they are delecious so I decided to give this a try. I made some changes but minor ones as I prefer more of a stew than soup and this was delecious.

I even called my girlfriend (who is of Portuguese decent) to make sure the ingredients sounded cohesive. The only changes I made was to use Chorizo instead of smoked sausage (make sure to drain the Chorizo after you cook it) and I used beef broth instead of water & I reserves 1/4 of the cabbage and didn't add it until the last 15 minutes of cooking so it had some crunch to it. The first 2 bites I thought 'Oh my goodness this was a mistake' and then on the 3rd bite it was like it all came together and it was amazing! Each bite got better and better. It just takes getting use to the uniqueness of the ingredients but it is so worth it. This will be a perfect dish to make in the Winter. I served mine with a garden salad and a crusty French bread. Thank you for sharing the recipe. It will be made in our house over and over.",
