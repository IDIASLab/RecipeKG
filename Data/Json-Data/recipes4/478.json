I then added some olive oil to a pan and seared the roast on sides and ends. Then I put bay leaf in my roasting pan and set the pork on top of that. Topped it with onion and put onions and celery in the pan, then added chicken broth. Covered with foil and roasted at 300. Kept the mushrooms whole and added baby carrots at the end. The broth is so good it makes a lovely gravy or base for pork noodles the next day (shred the pork and serve buffet style with soy sauce, noodles, thin sliced celery and green onion and add a bit of the heated broth.",
