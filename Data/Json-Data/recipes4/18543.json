                "reviewBody": "I modified and am still playing w/ this recipe; because I cannot stand stevia in most things, (I even used to grow it  a decade before folks started figuring out it's value). So I substituted a mix of xylitol and allulose (haven't perfected it yet, but about 6 to 8 tsp). Xylitol is delish & moderately cheap compared to other sweeteners, but too much of it can give people digestive trouble  Next batch I'm going to try 4tsp xylitol & 4tsp allulose. Oh, also, I ground the \"sugars\" in my little krups grinder to make \"powdered sugar\" so it would have a less difficult time dissolving w/ so much gelatin. Worked like a charm! Point is I've tried MANY gummy recipes and NONE have turned out this good! The trick I found on another site is to let them cure for 3 days in the fridge. Just set them on a plate open in the fridge. It REALLY made a difference. Next time I might cover them w/ a papertowl. Also, I think the more original flavors of koolaid work best, they have the \"strongest\" flavor, with the more modern flavors, the flavor sort of got lost. One of the easiest and quickest recipes ever. My sugar addicted,, 5-pound gummy bear buying family even  thought this was actually good... not just \"good for being sugar free\". Thank you!",
