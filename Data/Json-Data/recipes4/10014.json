For more flavor I added 2 cloves fresh minced garlic to the dough. This dough is great very easy to work with! I used potatoes carrots & onions for the filling sauteed in chicken broth & added dill & cumin to that. I used leftover beef made in a crockpot & used juice from that to make a gravy for over the top....delicious!",
