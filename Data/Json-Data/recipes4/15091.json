I didn't soak the red onion in water because we like the strong taste of it. Besides this I didn't change a thing except adding some sliced black olives for color and extra flavor. Next time though I might add more red onion. I made the French-Greek Dressing from this site and it was delish (please read my review on the dressing). It's flavorful fun and definitely a keeper. Thank you JARRIE for sharing",
