                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe exactly as it was written and my husband, the hunter, and I both loved it.  I was a little hesitant about the olives but I too hate it when people alter a recipe before even trying it so I left them in. I was glad I did because you don't taste them specifically they just add to the yummy flavor.\n\nI did need to add a little more olive oil for browing because the coated meat absorbed it pretty quickly. \n\nThe next time I make this recipe I will save the leftover broth from the can and add more as needed (the mixture was pretty thick when done) about 15 minutes before serving.  I served it with noodles but would use rice next time.\n\nI have a few tips for those who commented about the tiny bones because I have experienced that in the past.  These tips alleviated the problem.\n#1  Do not overcook.  I cooked these for 4 hours on high and they were moist and perfectly cooked.  \n#2 and most important.  Debone the breasts before cooking.  You don't really lose much meat (I breaded every small piece)and by taking out the ribs you eliminate the small bones.  If you don't overcook them the legs stay pretty much intact. This also helps you catch any BBs that might have been missed during cleaning.\n\nThanks for a great pheasant recipe MBETHCOOKS. I've been looking for one for a long time and this is the one I will use from now on.",
