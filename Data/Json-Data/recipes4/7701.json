I put a layer of taquitos, pour half the sauce, spread refried beans over the top, add the cheese, another layer of taquitos,  sauce and cheese. It's really good with an egg on top. I make my own enchilada sauce when time permits. Thanks for sharing your recipe!",

I love cooking and don't mind complicated recipes but the simplicity of this one was attractive for those nights when I don't have a lot of time. It was so easy to make and I did not change a thing. It was very good. Don't get me wrong I have had better enchiladas but the ease and simplicity of the recipe and the fact that my 4 boys loved it merits the 4 stars. I did not think there would be enough sauce to cover the Taquitos but it was fine. Also I tried to find the largest Taquitos and all I could find were about 1\" diameter. But it turned out great! Check it after 25 minutes - my cheese started to brown at about that time and I like my cheese gooey not crunchy. Adios amigos!",

I only changed one thing....instead of cream of mushroom soup I used cream of chicken soup. My son won't do the mushroom thing so I had to change things up a bit. We love black olives so I put them on top with a little chopped green onions! This was awesome. Thanks soooo much for this recipe....I would never have thought of using the frozen ones...so much easier!",
