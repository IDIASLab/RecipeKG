Here in Turkey, it can be thrown together with basic ingredients found in any kitchen. This version tastes exactly like the soup you'll get at a family dinner or a kebap shop. Ezo the bride probably peeled and chopped her own tomatoes, but in this recipe the canned version works just as well. For a more robust taste, try sauteeing the tomato paste with the vegetables for a couple minutes before adding the chicken stock. Watch it closely at the end as the grains might soak up too much liquid and start sticking to the bottom. Also, crushed red pepper flakes are more traditional than cayenne pepper. Sprinkle on top and add a sprig of mint and a lemon wedge on the side for restaurant-style service.",

I needed to up the liquid to 55 oz of chicken broth. I 1.5'd all the spices (so 1.5 tsp paprika, 1 tsp cayenne, 1.5 tbs mint). Threw in a shake of onion powder and garlic powder. 3 cloves of garlic. Used 3 TBS of tomato paste and 1 plum tomato diced by hand instead of the diced tomatoes. SO DELICIOUS!\nUPDATE: This is now a weekly meal in my house. My boyfriend can't get enough of it - he literally pours it into a coffee mug and just drinks it.",
