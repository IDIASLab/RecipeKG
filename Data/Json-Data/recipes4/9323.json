I am Mexican and yes, as another reviewer suggested, lard is the best way to make them for \"authentic\" taste, but honestly, who needs all that fat???  In the beginning my mother used to make them with Lard, but since my dad found out his cholesterol level was so high, my mom started to make them with shortening.  I have also always made them with shortening and I cannot imagine now having them any other way.  This is a great recipe and a suggestion to you all: try the butter flavored shortening, it makes them taste great!  For a great alternative, you can substitute sugar and cinnamon for the salt, makes healthier type of bunelos!  Oh and for those reviewers that say these were too tough, you have to realize that you have to use extremely hot water, as hot as your hands can handle.  I hope this helps!",

Being from Mexico, I've never seen a woman making toritillas without having a Kitchen towel folded over and stacking the tortillas inbetween as they are comming off the griddle or comal. Infact my mother will go a step further and place a Kitchen towel (folded in half) into a gallon sized ziplock bag, this all in the effort to keep the tortillas pliable/soft.  Once you are all through making your taco's, burritos, etc, you can take the towel out of the bag and store the tortillas in the bag, in your fridge.  Whenever you need one or two, reheat on a hot griddle pan turning as necessary and they become pliable once again.  Tortillas are like bread, you leave them out in the open, they get hard.  Another thing that will make them hard is leaving them unattended on the griddle too long, the moisture is wisked out and not suitable for tacos, burritos, or anything.  I hope this additional step keeps the rating for this recipe high, as it really is no different (except for lard), than my Mexican mother makes.   ",

                "reviewBody": "Some people must think that 'authentic' means tastes like store bought. It does not. Last summer while my husband and I were in Old Town San Diego we bought tortillas from a lovely Hispanic woman who was cooking on an outdoor griddle in front of a restaurant. These tortillas tast exactly like the ones we had!(except she used lard) I did change a couple things. I used 3 T. shortning and 2 butter. I used 1&1/2 t.salt and it was just right. The water I used was just under boiling. I have a Kitchen Aid and I added the water slowly as the mixer worked. The dough was perfect and a snap to roll out. Actually I rolled them paper thin and they puffed up perfect. 30 seconds on each side. After mixing the dough I divided it up into golf ball sized rounds THEN let it rest under a damp towel for an hour. That way you don't compress the dough making the rounds after the dough rests. Very easy to roll. If your tortillas are hard and crumbly you're cooking them too long or the dough is too dry. They are supposed to be soft with brown bubbles. This was so simple and so 'authentic' I will never buy another pack of store tortillas! Thank you Jamie!5++++++",

I think the error was in how thin we rolled it out. My husband gave me a tip, hes mexican and has seen his mom make it plenty of times, and said NOT to roll it out super thin. If it has more thickness, it becomes more pliable and not so flaky. ALSO, make sure your pan is on medium -high heat. if not, it cooks too slow, making the tortilla cook through too hard. Ill try it next time, and see if that makes a difference! As for the taste, it was wonderful!! Practice makes perfect!",
