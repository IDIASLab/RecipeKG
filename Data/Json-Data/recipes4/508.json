I used a basic cream cheese dough for the crust (from Pampered Chef's recipe for pecan tassies) & I substituted onion flakes for the green onion and they turned out great.  Since I was limited on oven space the morning of the Brunch I made these a couple days before and put then in the freezer until that morning.  I placed them on foil and put them in the toaster oven until they were heated through and it was just like they were mixed up and baked right then.  I will make these again - great to have in the freezer to use for an appetizer for drop in company too.",
