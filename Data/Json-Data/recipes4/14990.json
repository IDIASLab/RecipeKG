        "description": "This avocado sushi recipe  goes over the basics of sushi rolling so that you can make your own amazing brown rice  sushi. It might take some practice to get the hang of rolling, but it's worth it. Short grain brown rice is sticky enough to use instead of white sushi rice, but long grain brown rice will not work. Use apple cider vinegar if you can't find brown rice vinegar. Bowls of tamari (or soy sauce), pickled ginger and wasabi are commonly served alongside for dipping.",

Next time in going to add jalape\u00f1o and cabbage. I didn't have a bamboo roller so I used plastic wrap. It worked great. I think I'm going to have this for dinner too, it was that good. I will add edamame to my dinner though.",
