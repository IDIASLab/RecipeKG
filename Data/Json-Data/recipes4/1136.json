If this tastes bland or you feel it needs 4x the spices, you probably are using jarred spices that have been sitting in your cabinet since the Truman administration. \r\n\r\nI think by and large crushing cinnamon sticks is a risky proposition - most cinnamon sticks in the US are for dipping in punch or decoration for some coffee drink - they are usually just awful.  Ground coinnamon isn't perfect but a teaspoon will more than do.\r\n\r\nI have been cooking from scratch for 20 years and have NEVER seen a fresh chickpea at any market. I assume that this reviewer meant canned as opposed to dry...I hope.\r\n\r\nI never add the canned liquid from beans, it has some starch, but a quick blend with the immersion blender or mashing some of the garbanzo's against the side of the pan with a fork will thicken it up nicely and you don't risk the tinny flavour of the canned liquid....obviously add as much or as little liquid as you prefer.",

I scaled the recipe (for which I'm now kicking myself) to 4, used 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon instead of crushing the stick, omitted the salt, added 2 cups of diced left over turkey, and 1/2 cup of vegetable broth (from a  cube) to add extra sauce and replace the omitted salt. Served it over jasmine rice and called it a day. This (with or without my turkey addition) will become a regular menu offering in our house. Someone else wrote that it will satisfy your craving for curry- and they are totally right. Cheers!",

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and drained the chickpeas while adding a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes, undrained. I also used ground cinnamon and ground cloves. Be sure to stir in the cilantro just before serving and to save some to sprinkle on top. The cayenne pepper made it spicy hot but not too much so- be adventurous and leave it in. Indian food has to have a nice bite to it! Serve some raita on the side to cool the palate if needed. Thanks for one of the best ways to cooking chickpeas I've experienced!",
