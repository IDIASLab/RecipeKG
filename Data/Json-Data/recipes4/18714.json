My breading stayed on but once they were flipped, all of the crisp that I got on the bottom side turned to a wet mush. I'm confident if these were not flipped they would have turned out great. After all, you've got the spray on the bottom and the top of them. Just my two cents. This is a healthier alternative to frying but I recommend leaving them as is on the baking sheet and no flipping. Less effort on your part too. Win/win!",
