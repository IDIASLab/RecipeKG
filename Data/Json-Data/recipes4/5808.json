I began the recipe by frying some tofu in the oil (wok.... 1 inch width slices.  Key is to not touch the slices for 7 minutes until you flip!) as my rice was cooking (in the rice cooker).  Then, I followed the recipe as written, but threw in some thawed freezer veggies as well (broccoli and spinach) with the shoots, sprouts, and shrooms.  I mixed the rice, soy sauce, and onions in a separate bowl, and we each served our own since I will kill people with gochu chung or siracha.  I give this 10 stars.  I have been searching for a good bibimpop recipe, and this reminded me of Korea as much as the ingredients could allow!!!  Loved the addition of the mushrooms.  I will make this over and over.  THANK YOU!  Perfect!",

For lunch they would sub. the egg with cut up chicken or beef. It was pretty quick to make, because I had leftover rice yesterday from the rice cooker. I just heated the rice, green onion, and soy sauce in the microwave to save on pans. I had the green onion, carrots, and zucchini and not the other vegetables and it was fine. I don't remember this having more than like 2 or 3 vegetables. I just made 1 serving and everything fit in one small pot and one tiny frying pan for the egg. It's a little salty, but I have that experience with most recipes that contain soy sauce. I did use low sodium. I would definitely have the chili sauce on hand. I used sirachi. Although, it is hot. So, I just put a few drops here and there. It's all that it needed.",
