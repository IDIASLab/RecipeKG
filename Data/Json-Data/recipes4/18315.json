You can also use some chicken stock for added flavor. The trick is the lemon which makes the chicken tender and adds flavor to the soup. Leftovers won't last very long with this.",

Don't scimp on the flour, the more flour you use the thicker your broth will be.  When you take the chicken out to remove from the bones  and add your dumplings you should remove the lemon as well.  If you add frozen vegetables it is important that you bring your broth back to a boil BEFORE adding your dumplings.  These are flat dumplings from the Kentucky region NOT drop dumplings which are similar to matza.  When I say a pinch of salt I am talking old school grandma used her hand to measure, it's probably more like a tablespoon,  just taste and adjust accordingly.  Hope this helps",

Love this technique,  I love using the broth to make the dumplings! If you think your dumplings will be plain Jane, you're so wrong. The seasonings of the broth transfer right over to the dumplings. I used left over chicken breasts and drum sticks. Deboned them then threw it all  (bones and all) in the pot to boil and make a broth. Pulled out the bones with tongs before adding dumplings.  Whole family ate it and loved it. Thank you so much! This is definitely a keeper. I feel recipes like this are hard to come by, felt like it came with a little peice of history. (For me. I realize this maybe old hat for some.) Couldn't be happier. Next time I will take a picture.",

It makes the soup have a weird acidic taste that it hard to get out of your mouth. To make the lemon taste not as strong I had to add a variety of seasonings, add a LOT of water, and add some sugar. \n\nI would also double up the veggies. I love veggies and didn\u2019t think there was enough. I also added peas because they were in the picture but not in the recipe. I liked the dumplings and they were easy to make but they were hard to handle since the broth was so hot. I do like the southern dumplings that are like biscuits in chicken n dumplings, but I was actually looking forward to these dumplings and they are pretty good. \n\nThe only really bad thing was the darn lemon! Since it is boiled into the broth and chicken it is SO hard to get rid of. It\u2019s boiled into your chicken, your broth, and since you make your dumplings with the broth it\u2019s even built into your dumplings! A little lemon may be okay\u2026\u2026but just be cautious. My family loves lemons too. We love lemon flavored foods, but the lemon in this soup just makes it\u2026\u2026not enjoyable.",
