I had visited a farmer friend and gotten milk from his cows.  There was lots of cream on the milk which I skimmed off.  So I was looking for a recipe to use it up.  I made drop biscuits.  The batter is somewhat 'sticky'. The biscuits are very tender yet crispy outside.  I am planning to make more and freeze the batter in 'drops'.  YUM! (also made butter to put on them.  Heaven!)",

I put 2/3 cup canola oil or coconut oil along with 2 cups of SR flour. You mix it with the flour until the mixture looks crumbly like corn meal. Make a hole in the middle of the mixture and add the heavy cream all at once. Stir until the dough is formed. Procede as this recipe instructs. I never buy can biscuits. If you don't have self rising flour you can add 1 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon of baking powder to all purpose flour and follow with the oil and other ingredients. Additionally to make scones add 1/2 cup sugar and raisins. I hope this is helpful to someone.",
