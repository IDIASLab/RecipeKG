Before I served I added seasoning salt pepper and onion powder to taste. Another clove of minced garlic and a handful of cheddar cheese to the pot. I had roasted garlic instant mashed potatos (Betty Crocker kind) That added great flavor to the dish also. I think this would of been bland with out all the extra seasoning came out great though.
