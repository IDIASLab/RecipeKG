However I didn't choose to give this recipe a five star rating because of one small problem. In my opinion this cake has an overload of spices. All of my family members commented on this being a rather strong cake. With mixed spice cinnamon and lemon zest this cake is more than spicy. What I would recommend to others trying this recipe is to choose add the suggested amount of cinnamon and lemon zest and leave out the mixed spice. With two spices the mixed spice is fairly useless.",

However none of the other \"English\" Christmas cakes have any leavening at all but all the fruitcakes call for some. Anyway it was fine. A nice dense texture. I'm not so crazy about raisins so I substituted chopped dried mango craisins and dates for about half the raisins I sort of wish I'd soaked the fruit in a bit of brandy beforehand but maybe not. Perhaps in jolly old England they have crazy big 8\" square pans but I had to put this guy in a 9\"x13\" pan. I baked for 3 hours and it was perhaps a little overdone but a nice almost caramelized crust on top. The almonds are fabulous in this I wish I'd added a few more; I used slivered almonds. The taste is very rich and buttery. The texture is a bit dry but very good with coffee or tea.",

I will say that the Center of the cake was better but the outer edges were dry and unpalatable.  You need to make this in early November and \"water\" it with Brandy periodically to make it moist. Orange zest would be nice too.",
