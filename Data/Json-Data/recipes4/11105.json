I used reg canned chick broth, my ham & ham bone was a hillshire farm and those never seemed to be as salty to me.  I also used garlic and bayleaf. No green pepper on hand but I am sure it would taste even better with green pepper. We had french bread with it.  It was hit and I have 6 kids that loved it. Thank You!!

After reading the reviews I opted for low sodium chicken bouillon. The soup was seasoned perfectly. I had to cook the soup longer because of my additions... overall I cooked it for about 8-9 hours on low. Absolutely fabulous! 12/09: I actually bought and baked a ham yesterday solely so that I could make this soup with the leftover ham bone today (although the ham was delicious I was really craving this soup)!",

Anyone who is familiar with the show \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" can surely appreciate this because with the exception of my in-laws living 5 minutes away & not across the street.....they ARE Frank & Marie, and hubby & I are Ray & Debra.  I'm not at all kidding, really.  The in-laws called last night 4 TIMES, not leaving a message, and then came over to give me a.....yes a ham bone.  Not only did I think the worst, as my husband is (again) in Monterey on business, but..it was just a hambone.  Anyway, I was able to make the soup with it, and it turned out pretty good.  I subbed green beans for the peppers, and if I make it again, I will add some sort of pasta.  Nice & low cal.  Thanks Charlene.
