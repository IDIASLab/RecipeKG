I later found Splenda brown sugar at a  Canadian Superstore in the baking aisle. I also don't recommend using ED's pumpkin pie filling - I used that because that's all we had on hand. Use plain pumpkin otherwise you will over-spice like I did, since the pumpkin pie filling was already spiced. Sometimes our only purpose in life is to serve as a warning for others...",

I did what one person stated and reduced the water to 5 Cups increased the steel-cut oats to 1 3/4 cups and reduced the cooking time in the slow cooker to 4 hours on low. Also it is very helpful to line your crock pot with a Reynolds brand liner especially made for crock pots. Very easy clean up!! The amount of spices are way too much so I added 1 Tablespoon of each the ground cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. This was good but you could even add a little less if you don't like it so strong on the spices. One last mention I did not add any sugar while cooking. Would rather leave it for everyone in my family to add to taste.",

I cut down the cinnamon to 1 T and only used 3/4 c brown sugar regular not Splenda. Also I used 1 3/4 cup of Steel Cut oats and it was the perfect consistancy. I was worried when I first looked at it because it looked very soupy but once I stirred it up it was perfect. Topped it off with a sprinkling of brown sugar and some toasted walnuts. Yummy.

It came out very, very dense. The right ratio is 1 3/4 cups oats to the full 6 cups water. It will not be soupy at all, just nice and oatmeal-y in texture. \n\nAt first I also reduced the spices to  1 T each and cut the Splenda brown sugar blend to 1/2 cup, convinced it would be way too sweet and strong as written. Wrong again! \n\nIt worked very well the second time I made it, with 3/4 cup Splenda brown sugar mix. If you like this on the sweeter side the full cup would likely work well too.\n\nIt turns out that some of the spice and sugar gets neutralized by the pumpkin, which is why they do not overpower at all.\n\n6-7 hours on Low was perfect.\n\nThis is a really wonderful, healthy breakfast and I look forward to getting up in the morning. The recipe made enough for my husband and I to eat it three mornings in a row.",
