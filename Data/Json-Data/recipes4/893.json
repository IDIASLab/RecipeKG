Well, mixing it up was a real riot--I think my husband and I near cracked a rib from laughing so hard at the mess that was in the bowl...it brought back memories of praying to the porcelain god for sure....:o)  Then we popped in in the oven--and the most amazing thing happened--it actually came out looking like a loaf and it was pretty freakin' tasty--so much so that my carnivore hubby actually took a few slices for lunch one day.  Who knew?\nI followed the recipe exactly as stated--I'm not sure why there's so much oil in the recipe but one could easily use less than half of what's called for.  Once you make this loaf--you will quickly start imaginng all the things you could do to it--like swapping out the onion soup mix for something else, added veggies and other seasonings etc.  This recipe is pretty neat and a lot of fun.  I would recommend it to any skeptic.  The ONLY THING IS THAT I HAD TO BAKE IT LONGER--ABOUT AN HOUR UNTIL IT WAS FIRM IN THE MIDDLE...I checked it at 45 mins and it was still jiggly when I shook the pan so I put it back in there for awhile longer.",

I've made it several times, trying all sorts of variations and I loved it every time.  I tried it with one less egg, with no oil, with no nuts, with cashews, with a half cup of walnuts, with cooked diced peppers mixed in - all of them delicious.  I always made it with at least 2 cups of corn flakes and always with 2% fat cottage cheese.  It came out great everytime - never too mushy.  I even ate it hot out of the oven and the slices held their shape.  I have no idea what could be causing everyone else's problems.  I used a glass loaf pan and cook it for an hour.  I definately recommend the two cups of corn flakes and leaving out the oil.  Three eggs works just fine and if you love nuts, don't leave them out.  They sound odd but it really works.  I loved it with yellow bell peppers mixed in.  I'm going to try green peppers, carrots, onions, and mushrooms - not all at once.  Give this recipe a shot, it's worth it.",

It smelled wonderful when it was cooking and looked good. I ate one piece and decided it was too much all-around for me. I dont care for nuts so the taste of walnuts was too overpowering. I love cottage cheese and it was not as prominant as I thought it would be due to the name of the roast. I decided to throw out the rest of the loaf after only one piece. It was just not for me. I got a strange aftertaste in my mouth. I was dissapointed but the only way to know is to try it once right?",

My boyfriend and I had the result for lunch tonight and we were both amazed by how meatloaf-like and fairly tasty it was. Next time I will try making my own onion soup mix however because the one I bought had a bunch of artificial ingredients and left a weird aftertaste.",
