Next time I think I'd add some garlic (I am a garlic person). Oh and I used bacon instead of ham and jalapenos instead of green chiles. Overall I liked it. A bit more time to prepare than the recipe says. Would probably work great in a slow cooker! Next time I am using my slow cooker to make it easier to prepare (no boiling of potatoes and leeks just brown the beef and mix it all together well at the end to get the mashed potato effect).",

Instead of boiling the potatoes and leeks I sauteed the leeks while microwaving the potatoes until soft. When the leeks were soft I put them onto a plate and sauteed the rest of the meat and veggies in the same pan. While those were sauteeing I mashed the potatoes. This made it easy and use less dishes. We did sub veggie meat for the beef and my husband added ham after baking. Being Dutch he enjoyed it very much! Leftovers were great too!",
