Baked them for 25 minutes on a pizza stone, no spray.  Delicious!  Thank you for submitting.",

The wonderful thing about this recipe is the simplicity of it and the fun you can have adding different spices & seasonings. I added garlic powder, a little cumin, onion powder, salt, & pepper, all to my liking. Next time I think I'll add a little cayenne. (I always end up adding my own take on recipes, but it takes a great base recipe to start!)",
