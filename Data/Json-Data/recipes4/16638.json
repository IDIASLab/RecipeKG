Had an issue with the cheese layer oozing - with 4 eggs (maybe because I used extra large eggs?) the cottage cheese mixture was sooooo watery. I ended up adding the mozzarella cheese in there to help but it still oozed out while baking. Might use less eggs next time around 2. To make the layering easier I combined the tomato sauce with the meat/veggie mixture and the cottage cheese mixture with the mozz so each layer was pasta/meat-sauce/cheese/pepperoni/pasta. Still tastes as good I promise! Probably won't use mushrooms just because I wouldn't want to add any other water to this recipe and will use more pepperoni next time (only about half the package was used).",
