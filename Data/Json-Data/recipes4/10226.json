Do NOT cook the veggies as long as directed or they will indeed turn mush as other reviewers have mentioned. With that being said this still lacks. I'm sorry but it just does. I ended up subbing the bacon for sausage as the recipe submitter mentioned and adding a stalk of sliced celery but it still lacked in flavor. I added 1/4 cup of steak sauce (think A-1) and even though this helped it still needed something. I added 1/2 cup picante sauce and this seemed to do the trick. I gave this 3 stars which is pretty generous considering. You're really going to need to step this one up if you want a decent bowl of soup. Sorry but it is what it is...",
