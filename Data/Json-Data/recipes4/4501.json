For the sauce I used 2 Tbsp. of honey and 2 Tbsp. of brown sugar along with a bit of vanilla and cinnamon in order to give it more of a \"caramel\" flavor. I didn't bother doing it on the stove top - just microwave it for quicker and easier results. Melt the margarine or in my case Land O Lakes Lite butter and add the rest of the ingredients. I skewered the fruit and placed it on a lightly oiled grate. The strawberries cooked a bit faster than the rest of the fruit but that doesn't matter because the smell coming off the grill is Heavenly! There's more than enough sauce for basting so it's great to drizzle over the fruit when it comes off the grill (or just about anything else you can think of). This is perfect all by itself but would be wonderful over pound cake or ice cream if you want to take this over the top. Great summer treat!",
