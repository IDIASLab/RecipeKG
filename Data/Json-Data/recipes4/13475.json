I was hoping that it would lessen the strong taste of salmon which it did. The soup was good but didn't have a lot of flavor. I think if you added veggies like celery carrots and onions this would be great! I also think you need more than just a pinch of the thyme oregano and basil. I will definitely try this again but modify some. Definitely make with crunchy bread! It makes a world of difference. For those of you who aren't big salmon fans try this it's worth it!",

For all those worried about watery soup you need much more than a pinch of each herb (think 1 teaspoon) and also about a teaspoon of sea salt. Crusted bread is a must and adding a can of baby clams can substitute some of the salmon or just make the soup meatier. So good!",
