Only things I changed was reducing the recipe to a 3rd (only feeding one person here) and using Sohgave maple-flavored agave in place of maple syrup plus I added to it 1 tsp. of hemp hearts and sliced almonds as well as a tsp. of beef gelatin powder (since I need it for my joints and am looking for creative ways to hide it in foods). Was a decent dish -- certainly much better than a similar \"oats\"-style keto dish that called for erythritol (that one was gross). Could see myself making this one again. Thanks.",
