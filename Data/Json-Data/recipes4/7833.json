I store bought pizza dough and let it rise with some olive oil in the cookie sheet I cooked it in stretched and pre-baked for 10 min. I had to figure out a way to make a savory sauce but not pizza sauce because I felt the recipe was too dry the first time without some type of sauce. I whipped up some type of creamy mock Alfredo sauce using mayo sour cream cream garlic salt and pepper. (I know right) i used it as the bottom layer then topped that with American cheese slices then shaved steak mixture then saut\u00e9ed onion green peppers and mushroom and finished it off with mixed pizza cheese. For added flavor I put some basil red pepper flakes and salt and pepper. Baked at 425 for 12 min and broiled on high for an additional 3-4 min to crisp the crust. It was AMAZING!",

After I got done sauteing everything I had enough ingredients for two pizzas but I continued to follow the recipe as written. Because there was so much on the pizza the dough only cooked on the outside 1' ring and everything else was very doughy. The flavor was ok. Reminiscent of philly cheesesteak but kind of bland. The chewy partially cooked pizza dough though made this pizza inedible for us.",

I had the sliced steaks (like Steak-Ums) and used 4 of them. Did not have the pepper so I didn't use that. A true Philly cheesesteak does NOT have green peppers as one reviewer said. It's the steak and usually Cheez Whiz. No other toppings. I did saute the onion and mushrooms. I can't wait to make this again. Was so hungry when I made it so I had 2 slices. One slice would have been enough. It really was filling. Thank you so much for posting this!",
