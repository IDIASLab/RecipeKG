You have to like the flavor of plantains though. I love it! I made it this time with green plantains which have a more savory flavor. I also added a little bit of garlic powder. The next time I make this recipe I will try it with ripe plantains and I bet it will also be good only sweeter. Ripe plantains are very sweet. Depending on how you cut it you can use it in different ways. Thank you AlliS for this recipe!",
