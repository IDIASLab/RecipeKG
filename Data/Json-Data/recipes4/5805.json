I added salt and pepper to the marinade and used the lime juice to deglaze the pan before adding the onions and peppers. Definitely use pork tenderloin as suggested in this recipe. It is so tender and delicious. A cheaper cut won't do this recipe justice. Cooking time for the pork will vary depending on how thin you slice it. Mine only took about 2-3 each side.",
