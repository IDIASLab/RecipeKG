The salmon fillet was only 1/2 lb so I used all of the shrimp.  I also was low on breadcrumbs and used 1/2 cup of stuffing mix.  The shops here (Australia) do not have seafood seasoning so I looked up Old Bay online and threw into the cakes: allspice, mace, paprika, pepper, celery salt, crushed red pepper, ginger, and nutmeg. The one thing I noted was that the 3 tablespoons of butter in the breadcrumbs was a lot and that moisture was enough to stick a lot of it together which left me with about 1/2 of the mustard/mayo mixture and seasoning unused.  I would decrease butter in future and use more of the wet mix.  The end result was very tasty.",

I used a yellow onion instead of red, spicy brown mustard instead of dijon, garlic powder instead of salt, seasoning salt instead of Old Bay, salmon in a can instead of filet, and it came out GREAT! I served it over some fresh cooked spinach and it was perfect! I fell in love the second I made the mayo mixture. Next time I'll use fresh salmon and more panko to make then stick together more.",

First I used canned salmon and not the canned that still has the skin and bone on the fish! I used chicken of the sea boneless skinless pink salmon.  I used frozen shrimp.  Since I used frozen shrimp, I did cook the salmon/shrimp mix like the receipe says in order to cook off the water from the frozen shrimp. I used a frozen precut onion and pepper mix.  I doubled the recipe.  It worked fine.  I used fat free mayonaise.  However, I'm not sure if it is the mayonaise that keeps the patty together.  Perhaps next time I'll add an egg white to the mix because the patty did fall apart when I flipped it.  I used spray oil and butter.  everything worked perfect.  I will cook this again and again.",
