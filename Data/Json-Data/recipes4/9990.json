Along with the bratwurst i also added a half pound of bacon. I cut it up into 1 inch long strips and cooked it with the bratwurst. I was out of swiss cheese and found that a slice of american cheese in each bowl was a great substitute. I added a minced clove of fresh garlic and a few shakes of red pepper flakes when browning the meat. I also substituted corn beef broth (from the night before) for the water. I WILL make again.",

After the first 20 minutes of simmering the potatoes I added the cabbage and realized my potatoes are going to be mushy by the time the cabbage cooks all the way (which made the soup more like a very thick stew). Half way through simmering the cabbage I realized it's not cooking fast enough and there was not enough liquid. I threw in about a half cup of chicken broth and still had to simmer the cabbage for about 30 minutes overall (by that time I had no potatoes left in my soup at all). I bought fresh Swiss cheese from a deli in a block and cut it up into small chunks but even after simmering for an additional 10 minutes trying to melt the cheese it did not dissolve (perhaps shredded would of worked better). Then in the end the soup was very tasteless (although it smelt really really good). I added salt and pepper which made it a little better but it was still VERY bland. I think in the end the recipe is missing some sort of spice that will take it to the next level and I think the cooking instructions need to be altered.",
