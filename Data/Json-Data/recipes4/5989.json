I subsituted 1/3 cup of the chicken broth with home made white wine because I wanted to use it up. I had chicken breasts on hand and since we like white meat better we would not use thighs. I think these changes were insignificant however to the overall flavor. This wasn't overly rich and we liked the choices of herbs; it didn't have that \"dried dressing mix\" flavor of similar recipes. There wasn't too much preparation and it was easy. I will make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!",
