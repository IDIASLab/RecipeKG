My in-laws thought they were very good and my MIL even took the leftovers and made spaghetti. I did them in the crock pot on low for about 5 hours and I added an extra bag of meatballs to the sauce because some reviewers had mentioned this made a lot of sauce. Also I could only find an 18-oz jar of apple jelly so I used a little less than half. I didn't think that the sauce was too sweet but a perfect balence of sweet/tangy. Thanks for the post! We enjoyed this very much!",

This does make a lot of sauce, so don't hesitate to add more meatballs than this recipe calls for.  I cooked the sauce in the slow cooker for about five hours.
