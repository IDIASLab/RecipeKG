This reduces both sodium AND fat and left the bacon pliable enough to wrap.  Then, I cleaned & roasted 10 FRESH jalapenos in a drizzle of olive oil & a pinch of sea salt for about 10 minutes. Again, a reduction of sodium AND leaving nutrition in the pepper.  Then, I wrapped about a 1/3 of each jalapeno & a half-slice of bacon around each shrimp & secured with a toothpick.  I baked them at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.  In addition, I prepared an \"eye-balled\" provolone cheese sauce for dipping.  YUMMMMM!",

I consider the mesquite flavor an essential part of this dish. And don't use a \"sliver\" of jalapeno. Use a as big a slice as the shrimp will accommodate.

Anyway I recommend you get the biggest shrimp you can and of course be sure they are \"deveined\" (those are not really veins!:) Flavor could have been more interesting although Jalape\u00f1o is great it still could have used something more maybe sea salt or lime or cilantro perhaps a dip...
