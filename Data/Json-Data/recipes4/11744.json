I found the spiciness just right and I think it clearly lends itself well to variation which is always nice. The only super minor change that I made from the directions was to sautee the carrots with the onions because I wanted to make sure they got soft because my husband isn't a fan of carrots so if I can hide their texture he doesn't mind. Clearly though doesn't really effect the dish overall. Loved it!",

There are minor differences between each shop but mostly the differences I see are in Malaysia they use; chili sauce (think of a very sweet spicy ketchup) as well as ketchup fish cake thick soy sauce. You can use spaghetti for the noodle. I never had peas or corn in any I ate however I don't see a problem with adding them.",
