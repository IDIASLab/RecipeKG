Before tossing the finished salad mash up some of the garlic to add to the dressing. Bon Appetit:)",

I was asked to bring a salad but didn't want to bring a traditional lettuce tomato cucumber bla boring salad. It's a cold snowy February day I wanted something roasted and hearty. Wah-La! I Omitted the tomatoes they are terrible this time of year in MA. I also opted to skip the pine nuts. I am not a huge fan and I was on a budget. I used mini yukon potatoes cut in half. The person who submitted this recipe also rated it to add some suggestions. She is right you will need to nuke the potatoes for about 8-10 mins so they are just fork tender. 3 mins is not enough. Also I took some of the roasted garlic out and mashed it into the vinegar like she also suggested and tossed everything together. O man was it tastey! I tossed in sliced mushrooms to roast with the other veggies cus I had them and i LOVE them. YUM YUM YUM! and really healthy! My husband and I are eating the left overs tossed with chicken tonight for dinner. Can't wait! Thank you for sharing this recipe. It was exactly what I was looking for!",
