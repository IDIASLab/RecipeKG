My first tweak was to use some garlic butter that I had in my fridge that needed to be used. I nearly bought tomato yesterday but remembered I had some at home - yellow cherries I was going to quarter. Well I'm not sure what happened to those tomatoes but they're not in my fridge! So I rummaged around in my pantry and found diced tomatoes with green chilies. I did add another tbsp of diced green chilies because I had already opened my can - and it didn't look like there was much in the tomatoes. I did not want to buy a bag of tortilla chips to use 1/4 c. I had just bought some Pringles Tortillas-Southwestern Ranch - so I used those. I did use a little extra simply because 1/4 didn't seem like enough for 6 eggs. I also used extra colby jack cheese. I used up a bag not bothering to measure. My final tweak was to use my favorite corn & whole wheat blend tortillas warming them on my burner - I prefer the taste of tortillas on the burner to tortillas in the microwave.... These were yummy and received high praise from my company (=",
