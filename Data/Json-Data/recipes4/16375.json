I added a small amount of agave otherwise we would have likely not eaten it. I found the red wine vinegar harsh and fresh OJ is a must to help the balance. Also must sit overnight. Portions are very small if serving 4 as the kale wilts down. I did like the idea of the nuts seeds and fruit. Thanks sydneyt",
