First add a lot more cheese and wait to add the cheese to the top until the last 15 minutes. When I pulled it out of the oven the cheese had browned and it was tough. Perhaps covering the dish prior to baking would change that. Also add herbs and spices! Garlic would be awesome in this dish--fresh basil and some oregano would definately be good. You must try this recipe!",

I sauteed the spinach(water all squeezed out) with onion garlic pinch of dried oregano and crushed red chili flakes then added the sauce. I mixed it all with the shells put it in a casserole dish and topped with mozzerella and parmesan cheese. And it was sooo delicous I served it as a side dish along with breaded chicken. thanks for the recipe inspiration!!",

I took another reviewers advice and used fresh spinach I got at the famers market sauted it in olive oil minced garlic salt and pepper. I drained the excess moisture. I also wanted to reduce the fat content. I used egg beaters and reduced fat mozzerella cheese. This was fabulous with some steamed carrots and fresh fruit salad. I will be making this again. Thanks",
