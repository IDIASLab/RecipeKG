Ingredients are as for those in most any Upper Peninsula Finnish-style pasty, but cooked without a crust. When I make it, I just can't stop eating it, either hot or cold! Somehow the ingredients meld together for a wonderfully tasty, one-dish meal which is considerably more healthy than pasty with a crust. When serving, pass the ketchup, along with a side of your favorite coleslaw.",
