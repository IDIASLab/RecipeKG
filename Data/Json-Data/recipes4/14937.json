                "reviewBody": "UPDATE 4/2/ 2015: Had almost all the ingredients this time (minus the leek)...and it was awesome!! I did not soak the peas overnight. I fried the bacon until crisp and tore into pieces, and I sauteed the onion. Put a very meaty ham bone, bacon, peas, sauteed onion, chicken stock and water into the crock on high for the first hour; then turned to low. After 5 hours, I took out the ham bone, removed the meat and added meat back in...also put in the potatoes, carrots, garlic and celery at this time. After another two hours, I added all of the spices, sausage slices and 1 cup water. It was perfectly done in a total of 10 hours cooking. Lots of left overs for the freezer with only two of us...but the husband wants it for dinner again tomorrow night! ORIGINAL: This soup had a very pleasant flavor...even though I didn't have all the right ingredients. I had a VERY meaty ham bone in place of the ham hock, no bacon, no leek and no sausage. But I followed the recipe with everything else. The peas were soaked overnight prior to putting them into the slow cooker. The ham bone was cooked for the first 6 hours after which time I took it out and let it cool to remove the meat...adding the meat back into the cooker. At the very end, I used my immersible blender and gave it a few swirls to thicken the soup up a bit. I never had to add any additional liquid. Served with home made corn bread, and it made a delicious winter meal. I hope to have sausage on hand next time! Thanks for sharing!",

                "reviewBody": "Love the Dutch name and the soup tastes very good but the recipe has serious problems.  The dried split peas are well cooked, breaking up and coloring the soup in an hour or less, nowhere near the 3 to 4 hours in the recipe.  Altitude makes a difference and I'm at 200 ft. but one would have to be in Flagstaff, AZ, 7,000 ft., for it to take 3-4 hours.  Diced potatoes will cook in less than half an hour and be absolute mush in an hour so the two additional hours in the recipe is way way too long.  Also, the bacon does add a good flavor to the soup but the recipe should call for it to be fried to near crisp.  The salt needed is more like 3/4 tsp than 1/2 and, although I'm not a spicy food fan, I did use 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper rather than the 1/2 tsp called for.  I also used a large pot, one gallon, which was just the right size.",

I can't cook so most of my meals turn out as eat able so it was a home run on this one. I went back and forth on whether to fry the bacon first and opted not to. I think that was the right choice because it lent to a better flavor raw. I'm getting ready to make it again but don't have celery or leeks.

Also I didn't have any smoked sausage but I had plenty of ham to make up for it. I did not add the additional salt because the ham I used was salty enough. The only thing I would change for the next time I make would be to omitt the ground cloves. It is a much stronger spice than I anticipated and though my soup still turned out great with it I would prefer the soup better without the ground cloves.",

If you want to alter an ingredient or cooking method do it. I really don't think you can mess this up. Thanks for posting the original recipe and other reviewer ideas too.",
