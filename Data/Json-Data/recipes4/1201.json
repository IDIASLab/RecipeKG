Just as good as anything I've had in any restaurant (even though it made my house smell like curry for a day)! I've been wanting to make curried chicken forever and the fact that I can do it so simply now blows my mind! The other great thing is that you only have to use one spice which you can find in any store. I'm not even sure the curry powder I used was the best quality and the taste was still awesome! I used sliced pieces of chicken breast and browned in two batches. I also forgot the garlic and only used two small potatoes. Next time I'm going to add in some diced carrot and more potato for extra veggies! I also added a little flour after I poured in the water to ensure the sauce got thick since I didn't know if the potatoes would produce enough starch. I paired this with brown rice and it made for a nice healthy meal. FYI...I see that some reviews say it was too salty. I didn't use the salt amount from the recipe but instead just sprinkled a little all purpose seasoning on each piece of chicken and that was it. I can see how if I had added 2 tablespoons of salt it would have been way too much.",
