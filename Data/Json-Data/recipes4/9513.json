I made some this Christmas for my co-workers, family and friends' dogs and saw one being devoured by my co-worker's new black Lab pup. The dough was really stiff - it actually bent one of my doggie bone cookie cutters and dried out as you worked it. I had to add more tomato juice and water after rolling out a portion of the dough, and returning to work to it. EDIT: Reviews are in! All of my co-workers' dogs loved the biscuits. One got \"so crazy, she kept on getting paranoid that her treat was going to get taken from her!\" Another co-worker's dog \"kept on eyeing the bag on the counter and jumping up for them.\" Not bad for a \"healthy\" dog treat!",

She loves them they agree with her better than the boughten biscuits and they are easy to make. I followed the advice of other reviewers and left out the salt and substitute water for tomato juice. I use my KitchenAid with the heavy-duty mixer attachment and have no problem. I especially like this recipe because it uses the same ingredients I use for making bread for the family.",
