JUST REMEMBER to grease your baking sheet--I used wax paper--with an olive oil spray or some other flavored spray so they don't stick to the sheet!! I didn't grease my sheet the first time and it was torture to have to throw away those tasty fries and only be able to slowly pick off some.

I paired these with Asian Tuna Patties, another great allrecipes submission.  I may never eat another french fried potato again. Why would I when only 11% of the calories in this recipe are fat calories? It doesn't get much better than that. In trying to eat healthy, these french fries are a perfect choice for a side dish. I will be talking about these and using the recipe for the rest of my living years. As others have recommended, I did bag the Parmesan cheese and dried basil, coating the fries in three batches. I added salt and pepper separately.  Enjoy! This is one recipe I would choose any day of the week, healthy recipe or not.  Mmm.",

I lined my baking sheet with parchment paper and coated the fries with olive oil spray. I seasoned the fries with garlic salt and cajun spices and baked them in the oven for about 35-40 minutes (I don't see how 20 could be nearly enough... they were still very soggy but I did toss them a couple times to make sure they cooked evenly). For the person with sticking issues the parchment paper works perfectly. I crumbled some leftover gouda I had in the food processor and threw that on top in the last couple minutes then added another light coating of olive oil spray and added some fresh snipped chives. Together with the grilled gouda burgers we made we certainly didn't feel like we were on so tight a budget!",
