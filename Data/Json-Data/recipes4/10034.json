This was so easy and came out of the oven tender and flaky.  I added a tablespoon of sugar with the dry ingredients because I was making a fruit pie.  I didn't chill the dough before I rolled it out.  You must use waxed paper below and above because the dough tends to stick.  Use the bottom wax paper to 'flip' the dough into your pie pan and then peel off the paper.  Voila!",

I'll keep using this recipe from now on. Thanks.",

Finally! it can truly be \"easy as pie!\" I just wanted to do a test batch so I made 1/4 of the recipe wondering if it would even work 'cause that ends up being only 2 Tbsps of hot water. I used Spectrum Naturals Organic Shortening and followed the recipe exactly. After stirring until the dough came together I dumped it out on a sheet of parchment paper formed it into a flat 1/2 disk covered with Saran Wrap and popped into the 'fridge for MAYBE 2 or 3 min. After clearing off my counter I pulled the dough packet out of the fridge placed the whole shebang on the back side of a cookie sheet and using a smooth-sided water bottle (cuz I can't find my rolling pin) VERY easily rolled the whole thing out into an oblong roughly 1/4\" thick. I took the Saran Wrap off sprinkled some sugar and cinnamon over the top of the dough and put the whole thing into a pre-heated 450 degree oven for about 10 min. It came out tender and flaky and crisp - just like a pie dough should. Good flavor too! I was inspired to do more with this than just eat it:) - so I spread some left-over homemade cream cheese frosting over the crust while still warm then evenly spooned on some warm spiced chunky applesauce I'd just made. I cut this up into \"chunks\" (wow! was that crust tender and flaky to cut through!) and it makes an awesome flat apple tart!:D",

I was swayed by the glowing reviews. I am not at all disappointed. I followed the recipe to a \"t\" but did not roll the dough between waxed paper. I rolled it on a well floured counter. This crust is easy to make easy to rollout and the results are a light flakey crust. What more could you possibly ask for! I still prefer the buttery flavor of a butter crust but one reviewer said she made it with butter and it worked fine. If it does I just may say goodbye to Julia! Thanks for a GREAT recipe!",
