They're delicious, but should be an occasional treat. I love Indian food and I discovered Madras whilst at an Indian restaurant. It comes from a region known as Madras in southern India, which is now modern-day Chennai. This is a perfect swap - with fewer calories! Serve with a big spoonful of basmati rice, yogurt, and a fluffy naan.",

Next time I make it I will blend the tomatoes in with the onion/garlic/ginger paste to make it a true red sauce instead of pouring the tomatoes in with the chicken. Think I will like better. Warning: If Vindaloo Curry is used instead of Madras Curry (which I couldn't find) go sparingly because it is has a lot of heat. Use 1/4 the amount of curry given in the recipe for mild and 1/2 the amount for medium heat. Vindaloo Curry does give it that nice Indian flavor I was looking for.",
