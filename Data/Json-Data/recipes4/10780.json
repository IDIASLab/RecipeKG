By increasing the water you create a better gravy with the gizzards. This recipe is not like a plate of deep fried gizzards, the gravy smothers the gizzards, so serving this over rice, or mashed potatoes is the way to go. I also added some Cajun seasoning to the flour, and server braised brousel sprouts on the side! I highly recommend this recipe!!!!",
