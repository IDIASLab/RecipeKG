I added one more egg and this didn't help. In the end, I added 1/2 cup of heavy cream and that turned it into a very thick batter that I could scoop out with a spoon. I started off with warm oil and room temperature eggs but it still wasn't liquid-the coconut oil goes back to its solid state anyway. I attempted one pancake with the original ingredients and it burned into a blob after the oil melted again. After adding the aforementioned ingredients I was able to make the pancakes. The initial taste is nice. The texture is eggy and delicate. I couldn't finish the plate though, after about 5 bites I'd had enough. Sorry, Nicky, this just didn't work out for me.",
