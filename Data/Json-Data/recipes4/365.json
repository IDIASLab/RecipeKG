I cook on 350 for 30 minutes then lowered to 200 for 15 minutes because I was afraid of overcooking them. They came out very moist almost too moist and the bottoms had a nice thin brown crust from the butter and oil. Yum! My kids ate it up quickly my husband and I thought it was good as well but were a little thrown off with how tender they were. They almost had a tender fish consistency which is why I am rating it 4 stars. I will definitely cook these again experiment with seasonings and cook them in the oven for less time.",

You just don't need nearly as much as the recipe calls for. Flavor was good...I used soy instead of worchestershire like some of the other reviews suggested. I also baked at 350 but I found they needed 45 min at this temp not 35 min. I think the lower temp helps keep the chops tender.
