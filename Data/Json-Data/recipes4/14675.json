This is a great recipe with lots of room to play with the ingredients. Next time I'm thinking of a mushroom medley in there.",

Although everyone in my family ate this no one asked me to make it again. It has a lot of flavor but just seemed like something was missing and I'm not sure what. I put a splash of balsamic vinegar in my bowl and thought that improved the flavor a bit. If I ever cook this again I will probably try adding tomatoes to the recipe for a richer tangier flavor.",

To my dismay my husband brought home about 5-6 pounds of turnips when he came home one day from work! What on EARTH am I supposed to do with turnips? This was what I thought on Friday. Well I looked at your website and knew I'd figure it out. Thank you SO MUCH for posting this recipe! It will be used again in my house and I won't shy away from turnips in the future. I thought that the cinnamon added an interesting flavor and I really didn't even notice the bitterness of the turnips. I added a little bit of diced onion and also a bay leaf that I shredded up. My husband suggested that I add chicken to this in the future and we'll see what the leftovers are like tomorrow with the chicken that I added to this soup. It sounds like this is a vegetarian soup but I added about one piece of baked chicken to this. THANKS AGAIN CINDY!",
