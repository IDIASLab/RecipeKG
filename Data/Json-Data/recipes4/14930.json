I second the recommendation of using two limes - we love citrus in our household! Also instead of butter I used coconut oil and added just a bit of unsweetened shredded coconut. I can't say that we thought it was really white rice as some reviewers mentioned but it was so darn good nonetheless accompanying my husband's tasty Asian stir-fry. Already picked up two more cauliflower heads to make it again this week-end! Thank you for sharing this recipe Abussone!",
