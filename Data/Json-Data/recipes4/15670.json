I followed the recipe almost exactly in terms of ingredients:  used about 1.25 cups of barley and 8oz of thinly sliced crimini mushrooms.  If you use more barley watch the water level but the more you use and the longer you boil it, the creamier it gets so there's no need to make a roux.  I watched the salt, used more pepper and a snap shake of creole seasoning.  Also threw in some leftover green beans.  I also used leftover gravy instead of bouillon cubes but make sure your gravy is defatted or you'll have a greasy mess.  And lastly I used lots of turkey and this ended up more stewish than soupish, which was fine with me!  Cold weather, warm bread, this and your loved ones--a perfect evening.",

Drained the bones and let the broth rest in refrigerator overnight. Then I did the remainder of the recipe on the stove top over a low simmer for 1 hour and 20 minutes til barely was nice and tender. Hot french bread is a must with this tastey soup.",

I did tweak a bit for us though I know it would be great without changes. Doubled the barley. I only cooked the barley long enough for it to still be slightly chewy so the soup was ready almost an hour sooner. Skipped the carrots since I don't like them but upped the mushrooms and added them a bit after the barley. Added a couple splashes of vinegar near the end as I do for most soups and stews just enough to perk it up without being noticeable. Oh and I'll for sure double the recipe next time and have friends over.",
