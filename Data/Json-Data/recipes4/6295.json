I realized this too late and let the steaks cook in the pan like I normally would; however, once they were then in the crockpot they cooked to well done.  It was still really good - the meat was just cooked a lot more than we like it to be.",

I used New York Strip Steaks, fried the onions and garlic after frying the steak for a little bit, and then added the sauce, as well as 4 nice potatoes. I baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for an hour and 15 minutes and then turned the potatoes and felt it needed a little more liquid, so I added about a half cup of milk and worked it into the soups. After another 30 minutes, it was ready to eat. Talk abut tender and tasty! It turned out absolutely scrumptious! Thank you for sharing this recipe. It's definitely a keeper!",

I would season my flour with either salt and pepper or a seasoning salt before dredging my serving size pieces of  round steak. I would also lightly fry my sliced onion with 2 cloves of garlic and about half of a chopped green pepper.  I would also add a few sliced fresh mushrooms or use a can of sliced mushrooms if that is at hand to the soup mixture. Gravy was really good and I think the use of the cheddar cheese soup was what made the difference. I cooked this on low for 8 hrs while I was out and came out to a very tender delicious meal. Will definitely be making again.",
