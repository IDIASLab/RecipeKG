I only cook \"breast side down\" for an hour to hour and a half, as it keeps the breast looking nicer.  I also put my seasonings in butter and place pieces of the seasoned butter on top of my stuffing, so when it's upside down, it's melting into the meat and my turkey always turns out moist and very flavorful.  I also separate the skin on the breast and rub my butter mixed with seasonings underneath.  I never use measurements, but perhaps I will this year, so I can post it on this site.",

I promise, you will have a wonderful turkey.  Rub with olive oil, season inside and out with salt & pepper and roast at 20 minutes/lb at 325 uncovered till thigh temp reaches 165. (temp will rise to 170 while it stands). Just roast on a bed of carrot, onion, and celery and don't waste your time using a rack. Add 1/2cup water to the bottom of the roasting pan. When the tem  hits 165 remove from the oven to a platter, cver with foil and let and stand for 15-20 minutes for the internal juices to redistribute. Remove the veggies from the roasting pan and set aside.  Spoon off excess fat and use the pan juices to whisk up a wonderful pan gravy.  Enjoy!",
