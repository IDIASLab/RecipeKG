It is very easy to roll up the newspaper and there are no plates to clean. the kids love it. It is a lot of fun and a new way to have dinner. It was a one pot meal and added to the ease of cleanup. It feeds a lot of people although I just did half a recipe and still had leftovers. There is not much flavor to the dish. I did add the old bay 2 onions and 2 lemons. It smelled very good while cooking but it lacked in flavor. i am not sure what else to add to make it more flavorful.",
