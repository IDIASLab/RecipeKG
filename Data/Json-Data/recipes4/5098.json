                "reviewBody": "Hi all,   Keep in mind, the objective of the final step is to get slightly crispy outside with a moist, tender inside.   The recipe says a \"clove\" of garlic ... I meant a bulb, but of course, garlic to taste, and for that matter, salt. Remember to adjust your salt and spices to the size of the roast, but broth doesn't need the same levels of increases. If you're not a salty person, salt the roast as you normally would.  If you feel like you're over-salting, then you probably are. Also, make sure you're using Kosher style salt. If reg. salt, use less. The level of fat on your roast also plays a role - more fat, less salt. Written a long time ago -- I don't use cans of broth, just the sealed boxes -- about 1 will do. I have also used pork loin, and it tends to dry out-- try to buy one with more fat than you normally would. Shoulder/butt is much better.\n\nI often put the dutch oven in the oven at about 300-325 degrees, depending on how fast you need it to cook.    I have a summer version where I marinate the pork pieces in lime, garlic, olive oil, adobo chili sauce, cilantro, and onion.  I then grill outdoors to get the browned edges, and then set up a disposable aluminum pan covered with foil to do the braising in broth.  I keep it on the grill on very low heat until tender.  Then move the pieces indoors to finish with the same steps as the winter version.  \n\nSome great ideas here - crock pot/ coke/beer.  It's not an exact science.  It's just a cooking technique.",

I used pork sirloin, as that is what Costco had in the 8LB quantity. Salt and Garlic salt, then into the pot with oil to sear in batches. I pulled all the meat out, and sweated the onions and garlic in the pan juices before adding broth, spices, and meat back to the pot. Up to high uncovered, then covered on low for 2.5 hours. I then upped the heat to high and uncovered the pot to reduce the liquid by half. The meat was falling apart as I put it in the baking pan to crisp up, I added the reduced liquid to the meat a half cup at a time over the next 30 minutes. SOOOOOO Good. Served this with onions and cilantro, home made guac, and home made pico de gallo on the side. \n\nOne side note, I doubled the recipe, so should have used 8 can's broth...NO way that would have worked. I ended up using 5 cans for 8lbs of meat, and it was plenty. I also read the reviews and used the extra garlic. \n\nAwesome Recipe!! (Long time member here, this was my first review!) \n\nThanks so much!!",

I mean it.  By the time we sat down to eat I could hardly stand my hunger anymore.  And once we put our carnitas tacos together with locally made flour tortillas, pico de gallo, cheese (for Hubs), lettuce and sour cream, I thought I died and went to heaven.  No exaggerating, this is one fine recipe.  I used boneless pork sirloin chops and, with the exception of using half the amount of Kosher salt called for, I prepared this exactly as the recipe directed, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.  I\u2019ve already told you how good this smelled and this meat, this meal as we put it together, did not let us down.  The meat is SO flavorful, with a flavor all its own, so good I wouldn\u2019t even think about messing with those seasonings.  I made this in the Dutch oven as instructed, right up until the simmering.  At that point I transferred everything to my slow cooker and cooked it on high for three hours.  I\u2019ve made carnitas like this before, but never took the extra step of browning the meat first. I believe this is an important step that ought not be omitted.  My only criticism is with the salt.  Even using Kosher salt as directed (NOT table salt) the amount called for would have ruined this.  But given the heads up by other reviewers to that effect, I cannot in good conscience dock the rating for an otherwise perfect recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "I loved the cooking method for these carnitas!! Seriously best I've ever made or bought eating out.  I do admit I did a few things differently.  I upped the spices, did a dry rub on the pork and then fried it till crispy and brown before adding homemade broth.  I added an orange, juice and rind and more garlic then followed the rest of the instructions exactly.  AMAZING.  Like I said I only played with the spicing.  This is a great way to prepare carnitas.",
