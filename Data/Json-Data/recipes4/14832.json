The sauces on the chicken and beans tasted more like they belonged on a dessert than a dinner. There is absolutely no seasoning anywhere in this recipe. Maybe it's implied but \"salt and pepper to taste\" would be the bare minimum. I added salt pepper and garlic powder on the chicken before baking. One hour is a long time to bake boneless chicken breasts and mine were pretty dried out even though I stopped the baking after 50 minutes. Stuffing the chicken with uncooked bacon sounded like a very bad idea so I did cook my bacon first. It did not overcook even after 50 minutes. I added freshly ground black pepper to the green beans. These were my favorite part of the meal before I added the sauce (I skipped the peanuts). I also added pepper to the potatoes which I put into the oven for about 20 minutes while the chicken was baking. I ended up adding salt and more pepper to them before eating them. In short this meal wasn't a success especially for the amount of work it required and my husband hardly ate any of his portion. I won't be making it again. Sorry.",
