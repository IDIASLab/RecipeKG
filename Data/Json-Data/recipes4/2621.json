Refrigerated overnight, covered in foil, then put in a 375 oven for about 35 min, til nicely browned.  So easy and delicious; I can see this becoming a new Christmas morning tradition!",

I don't have anything that holds 12 pieces of bread flat (does anyone?) so I stacked the bread in a plastic container with a lid, and poured the mixture in between and on top, but ran out at the end.  In order to try to soak all the pieces, I flipped the container a couple times.  There must be a better way, because the next morning the pieces were so soaked that they were hard to get on the griddle in bread-shaped pieces.  If someone else has a different way, let us know.  Otherwise, stick to the standard dip-and-grill method.",
