I baked at 400 for 60 mins then pulled the bacon out and cooked the cabbage another 10 mins uncovered it to make sure the cabbage got to 165 F internally. I did this because the bacon looked raw in some places. Don't want to poison anyone. I fried the bacon up and crumbled it on top. It was delicious! Thank you for an awesome idea!",
