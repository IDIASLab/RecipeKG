When the shrimp came out they were delicious and crispy for a minute or two then they began to get soggy. I had to do several batches so most of my shrimp were doomed to sogginess. I solved the problem by quickly dipping the battered shrimp in Panko bread crumbs before frying. These stayed crispy and were very good but they were not exactly tempura shrimp anymore. This is a good recipe if you do a small amount and be sure to serve it immediately. I m not sure but I think this will be true of any tempura shrimp recipe.",
