The only thing we changed was after making the sauce and noodles we mixed it all together and baked it in a lazagna pan with mozzarella and parmesan cheses on top. It adds about 15 minutes to the prep/cook time but is well worth it. Not the healthiest dish in the world but a great substitution for the friday night pizza!",
