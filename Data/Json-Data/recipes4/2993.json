The second time I substituted lemon juice for the lemon and I liked it even more! I used fresh ground pepper and red algae salt to give it that little something extra. I use patchment paper to make a pouch to bake these in. I also lay the fish on top of either green beans or asparagus to save myself the trouble of cooking them separately. I then squeeze lemon over everything drizzle with olive oil use the pepper and salt again and let it bake for about 15 minutes. Then I let it sit for about 5 minutes then I open the pouch and serve it. I now use this recipe twice a week. I can't say enough about this! Thanks for the great recipe!",

Like reducing the baking time if you're only making two. Or the suggestion of making more stuffing to use as a side. My contribution to the recipe is to add a handful of roasted pine nuts and take just a few minutes to caramelize the onions before adding to the stuffing. We picked up the trout at Costco - froze two at a time in ziplocks and with this recipe we will enjoy trout anytime. Love this recipe!!!",

The only thing I will change next time is that I will not add lemon juice as one person suggested because it gave too much zing and took away from the balance IMO. I tossed red potatoes and e.v. olive oil in a 9x13 baking pan and put in the pre-heated oven while prepping the rest Then when the fish was ready for the oven laid asparagus spears across the potatoes and set the fish on top of the asparagus. All went together well and no need to foil-line the pan.",

I ended up wrapping the fish in foil and my husband used indirect heat on the grill to cook it at around 350 for 30 minutes. The fish came out moist and so flavorful. I added a lot more dill than was called for and I highly recommend doing so. I also happened to use Pepperidge Farm herbed stuffing as the filling because that's what I had on hand. The recipe took me a while because I had to de-bone my fish but it was well worth the effort. Everyone loved it... even my father in law who was scared to eat fish with scales. I highly recommend this recipe.",
