Changes: I fried and crumbled the bacon and added 2 T. bacon grease and increased the egg noodles to a 12 oz pkg. Frying and crumbling. the bacon added crunch and color (I think any food is tastier with bacon!) Changing the amount of noodles made little difference except to increase the number of servings. I wonder if the \"distinct\" aroma of cooking cabbage may keep some people from eating it (myself included)! After it is prepared the taste and smell of this dish is completely different than while cooking - amazing!",
