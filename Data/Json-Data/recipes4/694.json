I took note that other reviewers complained of it having too strong a wine flavor or being too tangy and with that in mind I took the lid off the crockpot for the last half hour and turned it on high. I think this allowed more of the alcohol to evaporate and the resulting dish was milder than previous tastings during cooking. (It also thickened the sauce nicely.) The chicken was very tender perfect! I'd add more mushrooms next time.",

Definitely season the chicken with salt, pepper and paprika, still needed a little salt, but then we like things very well seasoned.  I served it over angel hair pasta, with garlic green beans.

                "reviewBody": "Easy basic recipe but one that needs some tweaking to achieve a fuller flavor. Have made it several times and will continue to use the following method; browned the chicken in olive oil using a mixture of flour garlic seasoning salt paprika and onion powder to provide a richness to the sauce. I believe this enhances the flavor that so many reviews find lacking. Used the Golden Mushroom soup mix with golden sherry in place of the wine (as that's all I had on hand) and poured over the layer of chicken and thinly sliced portabella mushrooms. Reduced the cooking time to accommodate browning the chicken. Served over noodles for an easy low stress dinner. Perfect for the working mom! Thanks Judith for the submission! UPDATE: Just 2 of us for dinner vs the whole \"herd\" so I had plenty of leftovers. Had a \"hmmmm\" moment and thought this might be good as chicken and dumplings. So the next night I added chicken stock to the remaining gravy made herb dumplings found on this site brought the gravy and chicken to a slow rolling boil and added the dumplings to cook. I can't even begin to tell you what a great use of leftovers this was. Absolutely outstanding!",

I did a few things differently such as I used Campbells Cream of Mushroom With Roasted Garlic soup; added one cup of chicken broth to crock pot; I used 7 chicken thighs (skin removed) and browned them in some olive oil and garlic before placing them in the crock pot and when I placed the chicken in the crock pot I put thin slices of onion atop each of them. I also added about 1/4 cup of cooking sherry. I cooked it on \"low\" for 7 hours but for the last half hour or so I removed the cover and turned setting to \"high\". I served the chicken and gravy over noodles. The chicken was falling off the bone! A truly excellent dish.",

It was very quick to prepare aside from the normal time in the cooker and the chicken had the perfect consistency but it had a funny taste.

It wasn't a taste of the wine and our sour cream wasn't bad but the combination in the slow cooker made an almost unbearably sour taste.
