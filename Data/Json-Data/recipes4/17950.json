My family cooked with turmeric practically in all their cooking as it is very healthy spice.  This spaghetti sauce is tasty and I have made it for years.  The only thing I changed is instead of dicing and cubing the onions, carrots and potato, for a better sauce consistence and short cut I placed them all with the cilantro and garlic in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped, and followed the rest of the steps of the recipe.

My husband loves Bolognese sauce, but we\u2019ve had it so often that I\u2019m sick of it.  This is a great compromise, and it gets some veggies into his diet.\nHe is a diabetic, so I did not use potatoes.  I don\u2019t care for the taste of Mrs Dash products, so I also omitted that.   However, I\u2019m a Southern girl, so there\u2019s always okra in my freezer.  Okra having African origins, I thought it might make an excellent addition, so I added three pods, chopped.  \nThe resulting sauce was delicious and so fragrant!  Will certainly make this again.",
