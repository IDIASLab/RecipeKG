Placed frozen chicken breasts in the pot and poured all the other ingredients on top of it. Let it cook for 9 hours. On the 10th hour I added frozen peas and carrots. This version will be a little brothier (just how I like it) so reduce the chicken broth if you are using frozen chicken.",

I was hesitant to try this b/c of the soy sauce (i'm just not a fan!) but my husband loves soy sauce so I gave it a try and wow i really loved it! So fast and so easy. Will definitely make again.
