I didn't care for the batter on the cauliflower as it turned out, and I didn't like the honey in the sauce.  I know it's a very small amount, but the roasted cauliflower added enough sweetness for me.  As another reviewer suggested, I think it would be better if the sauce was cooked into the dish longer.  I decided to make again with some changes and loved it.  I coated the cauliflower in the butter-hot sauce mixture (minus the honey) with a little olive oil thrown in, too.  I used homemade hot sauce on my second try-made with Hot Portugal peppers.  I had some Parmesan peppercorn sourdough bread that had gone stale, and I whizzed some in the processor to make bread crumbs.  I then tossed the bread crumbs (with a bit of grated parm thrown in for good measure) with the cauliflower and then baked.  I got a nice crunch from the breadcrumbs and combined with the lovely, caramelized cauliflower, it was out of this world good.  Nice and spicy, too.  I cut the cauliflower into pretty small pieces, too.",

I would suggest baking at 450 and then crisping with broiler on both sides before adding the hot sauce and then baking again as instructed. Then the last 5 minutes crisp again with broiler.",

I made these as instructed (only instead of brushing on the hot sauce I gently tossed them around in a bowl as another reviewer suggested). It did not bother me that they were not crispy however when I made the leftovers the next day (15 min at 450 to reheat) the smaller pieces were quite crispy and I really liked that. Maybe I will try broiling before adding the wing sauce. Another thought when you make baked wings part of the secret is after you bread them you put them in the fridge for 2 - 3 hours before baking them. If I have the fridge space maybe I'll try that and I'll update my comments if that happens to change anything. I will certainly make these again probably 2 - 3 times a month in order to stay away from the deep fried chicken wings.",
