This is the perfect recipe when it's been cold and rainy and the kids come home with runny noses and sore throats.  I made this in my pressure cooker in 7 minutes using leftover grilled chicken breasts and threw in some potatoes to add a starch.  It's delicious, light and hits the spot. It also solves any gluten issues because everyone in the family can eat it meaning I don't have to make two different pots of soup.  The \"zoodles\" were fun but next time I'll make \"zaccheroni\" because the \"zoodles\" cut into long strips were sloppy to eat-the kids giggled the whole time though.  Do add the thyme as it really makes a difference.  Thanks BD Weld and your niece for the recipe; simple and effective and full of flavour.",

I try to eat lower-carb, and this soup allows me to \"indulge\" in chicken \"noodle\" soup without the extra carbs and calories. I'm always looking for new ways to use my Veggetti spiral slicer. The broth is so flavorful, like it's been simmering all day. This makes 6 very generous and healthy portions. I love the texture of the raw zucchini, which gives the soup some nice texture. I didn't have any leftover chicken, so I poached 2 breasts for about 10 mins in about 2 cups of seasoned water. I then used the leftover liquid to make up the broth, along with 1 carton of regular chicken broth and some leftover garlic-infused chicken broth I had. The dried herbs were spot on. To make the zoodles easier to eat, I piled them onto a cutting board, and cut them into 2-3\" pieces.  Even though it's not soup weather right now, this did the trick warming me up in my chilly air conditioned office.  This will be put into regular rotation for sure!",
