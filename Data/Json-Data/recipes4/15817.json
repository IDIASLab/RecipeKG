I hated the boiling method because it was a pain to get the shells off. My tried and true method never fails me, whether the eggs are fresh or old. So I will stick to that. I scaled the recipe down to try the filling and my husband said, \"Where's the pickle relish?\" I didn't think it was anything special either, so I made the rest according to my usual recipe with pickle relish and mayo. I had to double the food coloring to get the shade I wanted and it took about 15 minutes of soaking time. I think the colored deviled eggs will be a fun addition to the Easter dinner menu, especially for the Grands.",

Start water up to boiling in a deep saucepot that has a steamer insert available (put the steamer insert in right away when you turn the stovetop on, as well as the lid for the pot). When the water is at a rapid boil, carefully (I use a long-handled spoon) place the raw eggs into the pot, cover with the lid, and steam for 6 minutes for soft-boiled, 12 minutes for hard boiled. The shells come off beautifully, even if the eggs are right from the henhouse that day! :)\nI also made sure to steep the whites in the food color bath for 15 minutes, and they turned out beautiful! We used some pastel liquid food coloring I had on hand...perfect for Easter!",
