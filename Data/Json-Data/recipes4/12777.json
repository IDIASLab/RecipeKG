I did not thaw the spinach but did puree the spinach/broth/onion mixture before adding the cream base.  To cut fat I substituted 1 1/2 cups of half-and-half with a can of evaporated milk.  We will definitely be making this a lot -- easy and very satisfying.  Thanks for a great recipe.",

The taste reminded me of my mother's homemade creamed spinich just more \"soupy.\" My only suggestion is if you're making it for more than two adults double the recipe. 2 adults and one 7 year old finished this off in one sitting. We will make it again and we WILL double the recipe. Thanks!",

                "reviewBody": "Hmmm interesting. Good for something new. I sautteed the onions and fresh garlic then added the water and spinach( didn't bother to thaw) simmered then added 2.5 cups whole milk and pureed. I omitted the butter/flour roux. It needs plenty of salt and pepper about 1 ts of each. And what I learned is...do not puree! Follow the recipe on that. Purreing it made the spinach kinda in your face while before it was milder. But the butter/flour part can be omitted...use a TB of flour or so if you want to thicken it. What I dislike about it( probably my own fault for pureeing) was that it seemed very rich even without the butter/flour. I'll try again with 2 cups milk 3 cups water and not pureeing. Update: Ok if you were disappointed in this like I was stop eating and FREEZE! The reheated leftovers are SO much better! The spinach and milk taste much more blended together. I loved this for breakfast with Triscuits( No affliation I just love Triscuits) crushed in and a little cheese on top...I'm usually not a fan of topping soups with stuff but it so works for this. Parmesan and Monterrey Jack were both great.",
