For some reason, Allrecipes changed the directions I submitted. There is no need to chill the crust when it's coming out of the freezer, and no need to mess around with foil and pie weights (completely unnecessary). Follow these instructions, and you'll end up with a hearty, delicious, comfort food meal: Heat oven to 350. Prick pie shell with fork and bake for a few minutes to firm the crust. Brown beef and onion. Drain off fat. Squeeze spinach to remove moisture. Mix with beef and onion. Beat eggs. Add cream and spices. Combine this mixture with beef mixture. Pour into the baked pie shell. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake about 25 minutes until filling is set. (It takes longer in my oven. I loosely cover with foil to prevent the cheese and crust from burning for those first 25 minutes, and then bake it another 10 minutes or so uncovered to get everything nicely browned.) Let stand 10 minutes before slicing. (We never wait that long.) :)",

I used ground breakfast sausage in place of the hamburger 1c onion and fresh spinach in place of frozen. After browning the sausage & onions i put the spinach into the pan & covered it for it all to steam until the spinach wilted. Drain it well! The sausage I used was incredibly lean and didn't make any grease so i added a tbsp of bacon drippings to the pan before adding sausage and onion. I had a deep baking dish and smaller eggs fresh from a farm so I used 6 eggs and 1 1/2 c. milk. Left out the nutmeg but added shredded grana padano cheese (can use parmesan instead) into the mix. Topped it with shredded Colby instead of cheddar. It was incredibly good. My husband called it the best quiche he's ever had!",

I put the ground beef and veg mixture into the bottom of the pie pan sprinkled the cheese and poured on the eggs and milk. I added the seasonings in and added some red pepper too into the meat mixture while it was cooing.Also forgot to prebake the crust but it turned out fine baking @ 375 for 1 hour.
