I also was short on time so I just sauteed the sausage bell pepper onion and almonds on top of the stove. I cooked them until they were good and done and the moisture had evaporated. I drained off the fat added the rice soup mix and the water covered the pot and simmered about 40 minutes. I stirred it every now and then and near the end I just let it sit so the bottom got nice and brown (I used a teflon pot). I don't see why I can't just use chicken flavored Rice-a-Roni next time instead of the soup mix and rice. It was a very flavorful dish.",

This recipe is five stars with changes, four stars without.  First and foremost, for adult tastes, this is far better with hot sausage.  Also, once you have all your ingredients together on the stovetop, bring it to a boil and continue boiling for about three minutes, stirring frequently.  This reduces the baking time.  Next, pour everything into a 9x13 pan and bake uncovered on 350 for about 30 minutes.  My rice was tender, and all the liquid was absorbed after 30 minutes at 350.  If there are any leftovers, you'll find that this casserole is even better the second day!  Thank you so much.",
