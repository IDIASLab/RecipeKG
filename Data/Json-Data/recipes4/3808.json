It's a simplified version of a common Brazilian dish that I remember from my childhood and it's become a favorite even among my kids and I, even though we don't like fish! This can be made easily on the stovetop or in the slow cooker for a no-fail convenience meal. Use salmon in place of tilapia for a stronger fish flavor. Serve with hot rice or warm tortillas.",

I have a local place here that does this style cooking in a muqueca (clay pot) I don't have a clay pot but still wanted to make it and found this recipe to closest to what my restaurant does. I made this with mahi. It held up very well in the pot. I would suggest using it since other fish may flake easy. I didn't have actual cumin but added a dash of adobo which does. I also added chopped green onion for more color. I only used 1 red bell pepper. I wouldn't think you would need more then 2 peppers cause they tended to take away from the coconut milk flavor. I served it over some basmati rice and garlic bread for dipping and we were happy!",
