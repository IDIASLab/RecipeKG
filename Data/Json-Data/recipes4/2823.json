I used sweet onion, finely diced in place of the green onions because that is what I had on hand.  The dish looked a bit bland to me so I sprinkled a bit of sweet paprika over the top before baking.  In the future I will add celery seed,  cayenne, or possibly Old Bay because it is rather tame although rich.  Thanks for a new way to use crabmeat.  5/19/13 Update:  After refrigerating leftovers for 24 hrs after baking and finding them far more flavorful than yesterday I believe this should be assembled and refrigerated the day before it is to be used.  I do wish I had done so.",
