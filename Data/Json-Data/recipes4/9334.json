Thanks  to the reviewer who mentioned bringing the starter to room temp first. I made only 8 rolls, covered them with oiled saran wrap, stuck in the laundry room out of drafts, and let them sit for 45 minutes. Then I baked them in a lightly oiled cast iron skillet! Look at my purty photo! We tore into these babies like wild hounds. My friend who was here at the time ate three of them loaded with cold butter and preserves, apologizing that she simply couldn't stop. Thanks Debbie!",
