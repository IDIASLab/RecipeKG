I also added 2 tbsp of bacon bits and it gave a great smokey flavour. Also substituted half of the water with low sodium chicken stock and last but not least during boiling I added one carrot and one celery and pulled out half of each before blending. I am allergic to dairy and my husband is not. I and did not add the cream to mine and added some for his...and wow on both soups! So you don't have to add the cream if you don't want it its a great soup both ways.",
