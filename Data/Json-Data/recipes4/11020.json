I sauteed the onion with olive oil in a pressure cooker and added the water and all the vegetables including a couple of stalks of brocoli and cauliflower and cooked for 20 minutes. After straining I saved the chicken the broth added a couple of carrots frozen corn instead of creamy and fresh cilantro. Delicious I like the fact that is a broth base recipe.",
