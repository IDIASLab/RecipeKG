I followed the recipe and made 2 changes: 1) I used 3 tsp of Hawaiian salt I believe it's equivalent to sea salt. 2)I used 6 cups of beef broth (low sodium) instead of water. After letting it simmer for about 1 1/2 hr I added 2 c. of cooked rice. It kinda tastes like beef stew (watered down). My family loved it especially my 9 & 3 year. Thank you for the recipe!",

I didnt add any extra salt since there is plenty in the beef base. This turned out to be a great recipe better yet with some crusty bread!!!!",
