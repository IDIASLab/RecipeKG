I tried 3 times and ALL of my batches looked beautiful in the oven then I poked the hole and they slowly collapsed even with my efforts to poke holes at various times in the baking process letting them cool slower did the cream puff good luck dance.....what am I doing wrong???? My goodness what's the trick? UPDATE: I looked online and found a recipe very similar. It called to bake 45-50 minutes until a deep golden brown and dry. I finally got one batch to work using this method. I only lost one in this batch. Finally!",
