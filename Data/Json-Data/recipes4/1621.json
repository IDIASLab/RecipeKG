                "reviewBody": "I don't want to be overly critical, but the key to a juicy steak has nothing to do with whether or not it is frozen when you cook it. A truly great steak will be grilled at temp's reaching around 700 degrees. when you cook at this temp, the outside of the meat is immediately seared, thus locking the juices inside and giving you that perfect, crisp exterior that is the mark of a truly fine steak. While I agree that butter is a fine addition to almost any steak. I would deviate from some of these reviewers whom seem to view this as some new and unique technique. The French and Italians have been buttering steaks for years, and most of the better American steakhouses I've been to do this also. There are few things in life better than a thick cut steak marinated in olive oil, generously salted and peppered, and then seared to perfection over an oak fire. If you then serve the steak with a melting dob of tarragon butter- it's almost a religious experience.",

I might try this again in the future, but instead, would thaw & tenderize the steaks, and then \"marinate\" in a butter/worchestershire/garlic/salt/pepper sauce for a few hours before broiling.",

I am on house arrest/detention so I couldn't go outside and use the grill(get a DWI & you'll know the feeling!)like I normally would. I used two bone-in ribeyes, cut about an 1 1/2\" thick. Mine were also thawed. I marinated them in the \"soup\" for about an hour. I went a little lighter on the tenderizer and a little more with the garlic powder. I threw them in my olive oiled 12\" cast iron skillet under the pre-heated broiler for about 9 minutes on each side (remember mine are 1 1/2\") and they came out pink and juicy with a great flavor! We enjoyed our steaks with some steamed broccoli, mashed potatoes and an alcohol free beverage, watching the latest episode of COPS! A bit of added advice: If you're gonna cruise, stay away from the booze!",

In fact you need to be careful of that because you shock the meat and can 1) either hurt it to where it get tougher and it cannot hold the juices. Or 2) you can get sick from taking the meat from one extreme temperature to the other extreme temperature. \nI have found that if you thaw it out slowly in the refrigerator and the take it out to bring it to a more normal temp. You will find that it actually does make the steak very tender and juicy. \nAlso, after you are done cooking it.. Put it on a plate and cover it with foil for ten minutes. It redistributes the juices and helps keep the tenderness.\nIf you every wonder what takes so long at some restaurants for your steak, its because they let it sit for a little bit to make the juices redistribute before bringing it out to the table.",
