However, the flavours did not come out so much due to the lack of salt. I added some to our plates after tasting it, and it made a big difference. I don't know why, but pasta in this dish also felt a bit odd to me. I think I would make this sauce again but maybe with some basmati rice on the side or something. Also, I would cook it all in the same pot instead of in two pots, which means I would add the onions to the meat and continue this way, step by step, but all in one pot. I doubt it would make a difference, since I've done that to so many other recipes that asked for separate pots. Never made a difference!",
