I ended up putting some mayo in it and some ranch dressing mix to five it some flavor and it was better but still too strong on the vinegar. Also the recipe using ALL the grease from the bacon which I think is just way too unhealthy.",

Also mine didn't seem thick enough so I added about a 1/2 tsp cornstarch to thicken. Take note also- 6 red potatoes will not serve 8. Most red potatoes are rather small. If you use 6 med. red skinned potatoes it will serve about 4. I doubled the recipe and used about 12-14 med.potatoes. It made about 10 servings.",
