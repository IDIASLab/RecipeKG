One five ounce Greek yogurt and eight ounces of regular cream cheese. 4 chicken thighs for the meat. I followed the cooking directions to the letter. It was perfect. It was easy. It was yummy and tangy. I didn't even add the pepper I usually add to white sauces. This may become my favorite chicken recipe! I served it over rice pilaf and that worked well for us. Edited to add: I've made this a number of times now and have settled in to making it the same way each time. I use half the yogurt and twice the cream cheese. I now add half a yellow pepper. We prefer it served over rice.",
