This is one of my favorite comfort foods and is truly wonderful when feeling under the weather. You'll want to play with it to get the thickness and garlic level right for your tastes, but it is well worth it.",

It's very easy to make and made with common pantry items. I did cook the rice for a shorter time, because I had a feeling it would get mushy. I'd even consider cooking it less time, so that it's undercooked slightly.  Aside from the cooking time, I made the soup exactly as written. I ended up using about 3/4 tsp of garlic powder, and didn't add additional water at the end. The soup is nice and thick, and very filling. It makes about 6 good size servings. I did need to add salt and pepper since I felt it needed more flavor. Thank you for sharing your \"penicillin\" recipe! :)",
