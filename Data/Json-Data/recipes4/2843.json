The MOST IMPORTANT step for delicious tender tri-tip is to cut it perpendicular to the grain of the meat, NOT with the grain.  One reviewer mentioned her meat was tough, maybe it was cut  with the grain?.  Next time try cutting  the tri-tip perpendicular to the grain, you'll be pleased with  its tenderness. As others mentioned too much salt and no directions on cutting the meat.  That's why I gave it 2 stars.  If you follow these simple steps you will become a fan of grilled tri-tip",
