I use the broth from that (no bouillon) and to make it creamy I dissolve the cornstarch in milk instead of water (that's also on the back of the package). My grandma always added a bit of \"Gravy Master Sesoning and Browning Sauce\" (a nifty little glass jar with a brown and orange package that I always remember from childhood) which gives gravy a really nice flavor and color. Definitely stir constantly with a wire whisk as directed in order to avoid those nasty lumps.....",
