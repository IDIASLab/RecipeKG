The dressing really makes this stand out from the rest...LOVED the slightly sweet tanginess of the dressing w/ the creaminess of the cheese and the crunch of the broccoli. All of the veggies made a great combination of flavors together and the dressing just put it over the top. This was so light and fresh tasting and this is gonna sound corny but I really felt good eating it! Hubby already called the leftovers for lunch tomorrow so that's saying a lot lol. I have a confession though...I made this just as written but planned to add the romaine at the last minute and...I totally forgot to add it but it was wonderful so it worked out anyway. Make this early in the day to allow the flavors to blend well...I shook mine around in the container every so often to keep the veggies coated. Sherri Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe that is def gonna be a summer salad staple for us!:)",

We like broccoli in this house so as soon as I saw this recipe I knew I had to try it. I did make a few adjustments based on personal preference and ingredients on hand. I increased the honey just a bit and reduced the cumin but not by much. I used white button mushrooms. And because I had leaf lettuce on hand and it s not as sturdy as romaine I tossed it in just before serving. I also had to use regular sharp cheddar rather than white cheddar. This was light and refreshing and definitely not your typical broccoli salad. And just in time for those summer cookouts! Thank you Sherry and my broccoli loving hubby thanks you too!",

I used cherry tomatoes and omitted the mushrooms (yuck) and used about 1/2 cup fresh cilantro (we LOVE it). The smell of the dressing after I blended it made me nervous- I did not have high hopes b/c it just didn't smell good. I left the romaine out (didn't want it to get soggy- highly recommend leaving it out until ready to eat) and let the broccoli and other ing marinade for about an hour and a half. I filled each bowl about half full of romaine and then filled the rest of the bowl with the broccoli mixture and mixed it all up. I had every intention of adding some parmesan cheese but completely forgot and I am so glad I did b/c this was fantastic even without cheese! I am always counting calories and I could enjoy a large bowl of this with no worries at all AND it is really filling. The 2nd day was even better. I cannot express how great this was! One word of caution- go easy on the onion- Hubs thought it was a bit too strong... I didn't mind at all though... maybe personal preference. I will definitely be making this for our next 'company for dinner'. I just hope we can eat this outside- what a great warm weather salad. Wow really you have to try this.",
