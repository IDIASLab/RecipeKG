I also used minced garlic under the skin since I didn't have any garlic cloves and put some of the minced garlic in the can of beer. We put our chicken on a foil lined cookie sheet and placed on indirect heat on the grill. Our chicken was a 5 pounder we did 1 1/2 hours at 300 degrees then cranked it to 400 for about 45 min. The chicken came out super moist with crispy golden skin! We will definitely be making this again!!!",

The drippings make a wonderful gravy and all the rendered chicken fat doesn't total the grill.",
