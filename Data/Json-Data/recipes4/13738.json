I like lots of flavor, so I tend to interpret teaspoons as largely heaping teaspoons for spices.  I used a little over a pound of beef, heaping teaspoons of cumin, corriander, and turmeric, as well as minced fresh garlic (no powder required)I used the cardamom and cloves as listed, about 1 tbsp of minced ginger, and a 2 inch piece of cinnamon.  I used two extra large jalapenos, which were plenty. Cayenne/red chili powder is only needed to taste depending on how spicy the peppers are and how much you can handle.  Beef dishes tend to need to be cooked for 3-4 hours to be cooked properly until tender.  Potatoes can also be added to this dish towards the end of cooking. I served with basmati rice and homemade naan.",

I used about half a jalape\u00f1o instead of the Thai chiles; the dish has a really nice mix of warm heat from the cayenne and a more biting heat from the fresh chile. I omitted the garlic powder and added a few good healthy pinches of salt at the end of the cooking time. Oh and I only used two tablespoons of oil to caramelize the onions I used half mustard oil and half canola. We had this with basmati rice and garnished it with chopped cilantro. Next time I'd also serve it with some sort of cooling raita.",

                "reviewBody": "Very tasty. I'd recommend quickly searing the beef over a high heat before starting on the onions and setting it to one side until ready to add again. Seared beef adds even more depth to the flavour. If done quickly and evenly, there's no need to clean the skillet before starting on the onions.\n\nI couldn't get any chuck from my supermarket, so I had to settle for the leaner braising steak - and thus bumped up the cooking time to 2.5hrs. I had to keep adding a little water, even during the recommended cooking time, to prevent the dish from drying out.\n\nThe only other change I made was to add a bay leaf, as it's clear the spices in this recipe are cleverly balanced, ending up with a wonderfully deep and rich curry flavour.\n\nEdit: I've cooked this curry 4 times since, slightly varying the method. Every time it turns out great. My latest addition is to add chopped potatoes. I've also experimented with even slower cooking - 5 hours, low heat. \n\nThe trick is obviously in correct spicing, but as important, the length of time the onions cook for. They really do need to be quite a dark brown to get a full flavour. Beware, however, if you burn them don't even bother going any further. Chuck them out and start again. \n\nThe same applies to the spices - any hint of burning before adding the meat, start again.",
