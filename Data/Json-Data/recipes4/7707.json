The changes I made: I doubled the recipe and used an entire box of elbow macaroni (whole grain). I used light cream cheese instead of regular and skim milk, and a combo of Swiss and Monterey Jack cheeses (4c total) instead of all cheddar. I also used white pepper (\u00be tsp) and a generous swirl of siracha instead of black pepper and hot sauce (the cheese I used was white). The topping could be reduced to 1.5c bread crumbs (I used Panko) with 3 tbsp butter and fresh parsley. I omitted the jalapeno (for kids, although I'll use for adults in the future) also used a bit more Dijon (2tbsp for the double recipe). Even with my \"healthier\" changes, this recipe was delicious and raved about. Oh, and I made the cheese/macaron mixture a day ahead and run added the tipping and baked for 1h at 325 degrees before serving in a 9x13in disposable aluminum pan. Will definitely make again soon. Thanks!!",

Since the jalape\u00f1os were too spicy for my wife I left them out and substituted in one cup of pepper jack cheese with one cup of cheddar; reduced the cream cheese down to 4 ounces (half the amount). I crushed up a cup of stuffing mix to sub for the bread crumbs requested. This last step was done on a few other previous recipes and not only adds great flavor but a little crunch to it. This was awesome and will definately make it again.",

Some of the older reviews mentioned that, but I only read the ones on the first page, so I missed it. When I was making it, it seemed like a lot of sauce, so I used about 3/4 of the amount on all the sauce ingredients, and half the recommended cream cheese. Even with that adjustment, it was too much cheese sauce. Next time I would use half the sauce ingredients (or double the pasta if I have more people), and maybe 1/4 the cream cheese. Full disclosure: I did throw some saut\u00e9ed onions, garlic, and hot Italian sausage in, which I usually do for macaroni, and used a little Asiago cheese with the cheddar.",

I did double the entire recipe as I was taking it to a full-moon snowshoe party pot luck.  Everyone LOVED it.  Many people mentioned that they don't like spicy food in other reviews.  I felt it was cheesy enough that the jalape\u00f1os gave a little kick, but didn't overwhelm it or taste too hot.  I did make changes in the cooking of the recipe in this way . . . after assembling the recipe I put it in a crock pot to keep it warm and transport it to the party.  That worked out very well.  I didn't feel there was too much sauce, as many other people did, as once it's heated through and mixed well, it absorbs the sauce.  My husband said I can make this recipe once a week as far as he's concerned:)  If you have young children, add broccoli, spinach, peas, carrots, cauliflower, any vegetable you want them to eat and I'm sure they'll eat it!!!",

I have added broccoli, cauluflower, mushrooms, tomatoes, corn, (all at different times, some together). While my home made dishes were delicious this recipe was perfect. For those that say there was way too much sauce I completely agree... but if the directions in the recipe are followed you will find after cooking it is perfect. When pasta is cooked a little shy of tender it will absorb the sauces and continue to soften if baked. I used a can of green chillies and omitted the jalapeno as I do not like spicy food. This recipe is definately worth a go!",
