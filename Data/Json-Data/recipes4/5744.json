The white with red peppermint softened better at six minutes at 200 degrees. The regular kisses at 5 min. The caramel center and \"Andes\" type mint kisses at 4 min. For this reason it is best NOT to mix the kisses while baking. Bake them with like kisses because you'll have a mess and frustration (some kisses will be in a puddle and the others not soft enough. I put mine in a green quart mason jar for gifts. Happy Christmas!",
