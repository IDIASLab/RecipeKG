                "reviewBody": "This is a fabulous recipe!!!! I made it using filo pastry instead of puff pastry. I sprayed a 10\" quiche dish with olive oil then lined it with 3-4 sheets of filo. I sprayed on more olive oil (brushing it on) and applied another 3 layers or so of filo. I sprayed the filo again and turned the ends of filo that hung over the dish into the dish. I checked one last time to ensure that the last layer was lightly sprayed everywhere (top and sides) and baked it at 400 F for 10 minutes. I also used one package of frozen spinach which I thawed by putting in the skillet with 4 T of water. I cooked it over medium heat only until it was thawed to not destroy the nutrients. I then put the spinach in a sieve to drain pressing down lightly to extract as much water as possible. I didn't puree it. I just added it with the nutmeg to the egg mixture. I used 1% cottage cheese which I also drained (somewhat) in a sieve. I sauteed the onions in olive oil instead of butter. One large tomato thinly sliced will yield one layer over the onions--that's what I used. The rest I did according to the recipe. It looked great was very quick to make and boy did it go over well with both my vegetarian and non-vegetarian guests!! This recipe will become the family favorite!!! Many thanks Diane.",

I'm not permitted to have dairy products or refined flour products so I substituted Extra firm Tofu (drained and crumbled) for the cottage cheese instead of the fresh tomatoes I substituted sun dried tomatoes and used olive oil instead of the butter. I omitted the puff pastry (although I would have loved to have it) and I opted to have a nice salad on the side. Making this a tasty and filling meal. The next time I make this I'll opt to scale back just a tad on the nutmeg. I'll be making this one again. Thanks!",
