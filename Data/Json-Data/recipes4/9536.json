Instead of chicken, I used sliced sausage, which complemented the spinach flavor well. I doubled the garlic and used 10 oz. fresh spinach that I sauteed with the onion/garlic mixture. Another Stracciatella recipe uses lemon juice, so I added a scant Tbsp. which really perked up the soup. A plus for us: adding 1/3 C. milk/cream just before stirring in the eggs gives this a whole new look and flavor. YUM!",

I used garlic chicken broth since that was all I had on hand and decreased the amounts of chicken and spinach used due to what I had available. The parmesan makes it really yummy.
