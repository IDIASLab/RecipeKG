Also if you don't think it is spicy enough all you have to do is add more chili powder and that will do the trick...trust me mine was flaming!

I used bone-in, skin-on chicken legs separated at the joint, and removed excess fat. I doubled the recipe, but maybe tripled the spices, this is a must! I also added coconut milk and creamed coconut, because korma is supposed to have coconut something in it! This may seem like alot of coconut flavour, but they're both necessary to make this dish very creamy. I added cumin to take away the overwhelming coconut taste. I also add spinach. It's way creamier than the base recipe, and I love the way it tastes, my way. Thanks for the base recipe, Steve! I never buy the jarred korma anymore!",
