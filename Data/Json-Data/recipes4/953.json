I also made a glaze for the top with ketchup A1 and brown sugar and put it on about half way through the cooking time. It was so good I teased and said I made meatloaf taste like steak!!! everyone loved it and we all ate it for breakfast noone wanted to wait for lunch! oh I do not follow recipes very well I kinda get started and then do my own thing so I should mention that I just saw the part at the end with the ham cheese and broccoli:) I did do cheese just not like that.",
