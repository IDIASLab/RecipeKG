I made adjustments as did others and replaced the 3/4 cup almond butter with 1/3 peanut butter to save on and on fat calories. I also reduced the amount of honey to make it \"better\" for sugar content. Additionally I only added about 3/4 of the head of cabbage and added in some jicama in replacement for the crunch of the bean spouts since my local grocery store decided to stop carrying them due to problems they were having. I've made this for my family and for a nutrition group many without kitchen access great recipe thanks for posting!",
