I make my own pizza dough and had some leftover, so I used it instead of the frozen bread dough.  Here's a tip to help avoid excess grease (especially if you are a pepperoni purist like me and won't use turkey pepperoni) - lay pepperoni out on a double layer of paper towels and microwave for 15 - 20 seconds, then cover with 2 more paper towels and blot.  I do this when I make pizza and had very little grease when I baked my bread.  Brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with a little garlic powder and kosher salt before baking.  Great appetizer - I'll be making this for Super Bowl.",

I like to use deli sliced pepperoni, mushrooms, green olives, mild peppers and mozarella sliced or shredded.  We dip it in pizza sauce or ranch dressing.  Great \"game day\" meal.
