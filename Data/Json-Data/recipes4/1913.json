One, I put the sauerkraut on the bottom and omitted the bread cubes, but put extra on top. We used canned corned beef instead of deli style and it did excellent in this recipe, and a cost saver also! I made this the night before and thought with all the sitting, and early morning cooking (5am) that the bottom cubed bread would have gotten really soggy. They loved this recipe at work, it really went fast. The next time I make this I would reduce the dressing to 1 cup (8 oz) and mix with the sour cream. Even straining the sauerkraut really well and wringing it, there was a bit too much liquid in the bottom, but everyone loved this casserole! Super on a cold winter's day at work! \nThanks for the recipe!",

The only ingredient changes I made were I didn't add the minced onion (we didn't miss it and besides there are no onions on a reuben sandwich) I used LIGHT sour cream instead of regular and I only used 10 slices of just the light rye bread because that's what I had on hand... To keep them from getting too soggy I toasted the bread cubes first and made sure to squeeze out as much of the sauerkraut juice as I could before I layered it on top of the bread cubes... For the topping I slightly crumbled about 1 cup of the toasted bread cubes and then tossed them in the melted butter then sprinkled them on top of the cheese... Oh and I sprayed the foil w/PAM before covering it to keep it from sticking... YUM! YUM! I will definitely be making this again!",
