Second I would like to say that to omit something simply because you have not heard of it being used in traditional recipes is silly.  The tomato and bell pepper enhance the flavor but in no way overwhelm it.  This is the best Chicken and Dumplings recipe I've found, I'll look no further.  My husband also gave it a 5 star and I would say so did my 2 year old grand daughter since she gobbled it up!!!  Thanks for such a wonderful winter time comfort food!",

Also dumplings need more water. Here's a huge tip: when you are dropping the dumplings into the pot use your fingers and just kind of plop them in one by one. If you use a fork/spoon/etc the dough just kind of seems to come apart and the dumplings won't hold shape. Don't stir until the dumplings have firmed up or it will break all apart.",

                "reviewBody": "I thought it was pretty odd to have tomatoes and peppers in chcken and dumplings so I left them out. The seasonings for the broth are good though. I brought the chicken to a boil and skimmed off the foam and \"stuff\" that came to the top until it boiled clear before adding the vegetables. It makes sense to take the chicken off the bone and return it to the broth BEFORE you add the dumplings so I switched steps 2 and 3. The Bisquick box says 2 cups of baking mix and 2/3 cup of milk so I went with those proportions. It also says cook uncovered 10 minutes and then cover and cook 10 minutes more. I didn't want doughy dumplings so I cooked the full 20 minutes and they came out nice though I imagine it depends on the size you make I made 10 dumplings.",
