You can really just throw it together in whatever proportions you want.\n  My trick is stirring in two tablespoons of white vinegar with the potatoes immediately after you drain them and they are still hot. This gives the salad the perfect little zing that everyone seems to love. I think this is why I always get requests for the recipe.\n  DO NOT use dried chives. Use fresh or even better...USE GREEN ONIONS/SCALLIONS. Much tastier and more eye appeal.They don't get lost in the salad.\n   BEWARE: once you take this to a gathering, it will be YOUR thing to bring forever and always!!",

I used Hellman's light mayo along with the sour cream and added a few splashes of white wine vinegar. I also added some chopped fresh chives on top to pretty it up - YUM!",
