I couldn't find any focaccia bread at my bakery so I made my own using Michael's Foccacia Bread (on this site) it was great. I did add more mayo to the chipotle mayo since it was a bit spicy for my tastes. Also I don't have a panini press so I heated up a non stick pan and a cast iron pan put the sandwich in the non stick pan then placed the hot cast iron pan down on the top and pressed down slightly using a hot pad. It worked really great. Thanks for the recipe!",
