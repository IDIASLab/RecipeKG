The only thing I didn't have in stock was mozzarella cheese, so I substituted Colby jack cheese and a small amount of Asiago cheese. I also used half zucchini and yellow squash. I didn't have an 8 X 12 sized casserole but a 7 X 11 was perfect. A very quick and easy dish to make and tasted great. Our guest couldn't stop raving about it and they are pretty picky eaters. Baked up nice in 20 minutes and had a nice texture to it that held together very well when served.",

I got it from my first issue of the Allrecipes magazine (yay!) and followed the recipe with the suggested changes/instructions given by the magazine. For example, cook spices with onion and zucchini for better flavor instead of waiting until they are cooked to add spices. Another example: cool zucchini mixture 5 minutes before adding to egg mixture to avoid scrambling. This dish is wonderful. I am always looking for zucchini or yellow squash recipes that don't end up too runny; this was perfect, and super tasty too.",

Instead of basil and oregano, I used 1 tsp Italian seasonings (Penzey's Tuscan Sunset) and a little marjoram. I used whole grain mustard on the crust, enough to lightly coat the whole crust. Although some of the dough triangles were misshapen, I pinched all the seams together and it worked great. Don't make your crust extend too far above the dish, or else, like in the photo, the outermost edges will brown before the middle is set. A double recipe would be great for a potluck!",
