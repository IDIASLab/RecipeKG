I used leftover breakfast potatoes that had already been seasoned with onion, cumin, cayenne pepper, chili powder, garlic salt, and black pepper. I added red pepper flakes as an afterthought. I didn\u2019t add salt because the potatoes had been salted. It definitely needs the salt that the recipe calls for, so I ended up adding the salt in the recipe. I didn\u2019t add the water. I left it thick and creamy. I also left a few breakfast potatoes on the side to add back in to make it a chunkier soup, but it\u2019s such a beautiful pur\u00e9e on its own, it doesn\u2019t need the extra potatoes. I will definitely make this soup again.",
