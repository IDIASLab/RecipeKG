I put it in a ziploc baggie overnight in the refrig.  Put in casserole dish and poured a can of diced tomatoes over top.  Covered with foil and baked it for 2 1/2 hours at 325.  Best London broil I've ever made.  Usually comes out tough no matter how I make it, this was tender and flavorful.  Great recipe.  Will make again and again.  Thanks!",
