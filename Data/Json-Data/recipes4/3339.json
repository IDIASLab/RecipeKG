I did add just a tiny dash of maple syrup because when I initally tasted it, it was way to salty.  After refrigerating it overnight, it turned out wonderfully. There were 2 cheese balls there tonight, only mine got nearly devoured, lol.  I am taking another one of these to another dinner in a few days.  I did try the suggestion  of a gingersnap and it is indeed different.  It was too \"gingery\" for my tastes but others may like it.  A less salty cracker like Wheat things or water crackers would be great with this.  It is extrememly rich, but really good!!!",

I trimmed it for the second party and it was great.  The pistachio-dried cranberry topping made more than enough, so I saved the leftover topping in a baggie and it is great on oatmeal.  I will make this again and again...the red cranberries and green pistachios looked so festive.  Only thing:  I could only find pistachios in the shell and it took me forever by hand to open the shells and remove the nuts.  The pads of the fingers I used to pry open the relatively tight shells were sore afterwards.  If you can find shelled pistachios, it will save a lot of time and finger-work.",
