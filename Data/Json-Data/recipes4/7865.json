However, in addition to lacking creativity, I lack forethought. I didn't have garlic pepper. So Google told me it has garlic, pepper, brown sugar, paprika, and a couple of other things I don't have. So I sprinkled what I had on it, and...voila! C'est magnifique! My point isn't to change the recipe. My point is, if I can't screw this up, neither can you! So try it! Hahaha!\nMy entire family (including my 13 and 9 year olds) loved it. I did leave the lemon off of the 9 year old's portion, and the capers off of both of them; but we all loved it. My husband & I thought the lemon and capers were very good.",
