I used fresh asparagus from a local farm and hot Italian sausage from another local farm where I know their animals live a good life.  I like the health benefits of coconut oil, so used half coconut oil, half olive oil... didn't taste coconutty.  The Italian sausage and the cheese give this dish PLENTY of salt, so I didn't add salt to the pasta water or garlic salt.",

Also, I had 2 packages of fresh Asparagus that I wanted to use.  I came across this recipe and it sounded interesting....and we love garlic!  Because I had 6 sweet Italian sausages and so much asparagus, I doubled the recipe, and used about 8 cloves of finely minced garlic, and added onion salt, more than doubled the freshly grated parmesan as well as a cup of mozzarella and the other ingredients the recipe called for, and ladeled that over fresh spinach ravioli.  I'm a pretty good cook...but I don't usually RAVE over my own cooking.  THIS, I RAVED over, as did my family!  It tasted like something from a fine Italian restaurant!  (Another thing I recommend, is using young & thin asparagus, which is more tender and tastey, and cooking it in some of the sausage grease mixed with olive oil, before adding the tomatoes, etc.).  It was so delicious, and because I doubled the recipe, we have leftovers that we look forward to having for dinner tomorrow!!",
