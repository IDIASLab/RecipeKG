So I added an egg. I also added some worcesteshire to the meat mixture and eliminated the celery salt. I used 2 packages of dried onion soup mix to make a gravy. I make patties , not balls and once the patties (6 generous ones) were browned, I added the soup mixture (dry soup mix, water and flour) to the pan and let it cook 30-45 minutes. Served it with mashed potatoes and watched my family devour it. No leftovers. We like the brown gravy better than the tomato sauce. This is how my mom made it when we were kids in the 50's. Only no onion soup mix ...she made the gravy from scratch...",

My kids all requested the recipe when they moved out and now make it for their families. I do agree with some other reviewers that, if the recipe is followed exactly, it can be a little bland. I've learned to spice it up some over the years. I add extra seasoning (italian, more garlic and onion powder) to the meatballs as well as some of the worcestershire sauce. And I also add more seasoning to the sauce...more worcestershire (because we like the flavor), garlic, onion powder and some ketchup, or sugar or even brown sugar. We serve it on toasted french rolls, like a meatball sandwich but it's also good alone with side dishes. Great as leftovers too. I didn't know it could be cooked in the oven though. That's good to know.",

It's quick, and it's quite easy.\n\nNow, to add on to this base, there's a couple things I've done:\nI use instant rice instead of any long-grain/etc types - this makes the rice softer, fluffier, and cook quicker.\nI add a small amount of brown sugar to the sauce at the end - just enough to sweeten it slightly, but not make it too sweet.\n\nOther options: I've used Tabasco (or Frank's Red Hot) to add a kick to the sauce. It's subtle, it's flavorful, and it's only a small amount to give it that tiny heat edge.\n\nI will also serve it on a bed of rice (lightly seasoned with chicken bullion or even curry and butter).\n\nSo thanks for sharing! This is a lot like my mother's recipe (which I couldn't get one night because she was at work when I called, so I got this one), but this one is more flexible than hers.",
