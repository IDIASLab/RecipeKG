I also added 2 tsp. of a high-quality extra virgin olive oil,  for savor.  With eight servings of soup,  the oil adds only slightly more than one gram of fat per serving (the equivalent of eating one potato chip).  I was very pleased with the result,  which was light, savory and aromatic.  I used an entire small head of organic green cabbage (with the extra broth) and did not find the soup too loaded.  This is a good weight-loss soup,  since one can really tuck in without consuming too many calories.",

What I really liked was that it was simple and I had everything I needed without having to go to the grocery store. Hope this helps the pounds pour off!",
