I have to agree with the comments about the cooking times. I let it saute 3-4 mins. after adding the tomato. Also don't know where the crimini came from I usually use baby bella or white button. Also I read another review commenting of being bland and the chicken being dry. I have to say after making this so many times that the taste of the marinade is goiing to determine the taste of this dish so be sure to use a good vinegar and I think 1/4 cup of water is too much the recipe was posted with 2 tablespoons of water. Quality of the chicken will determine if it is dry.",

I might marinate the chicken all day or even 24 hours to see if that jazzed up the chicken. The other problem I had was that it was too long of a cooking time for the chicken breast cubes (maybe 15 minutes total cooking time instead) and they were very dry.(I should have known better) I would sub wine for the water in the future and I would definitely add more seasonings and fresh garlic. We tried it with three different cheeses on top and our favorite was fresh mozzarella. Overall an easy and healthy meal served with a salad and crusty bread. Thanks for sharing.",
