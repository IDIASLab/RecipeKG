Double the viniger to 2 table spoons triple the corn starch to 3 table spoons add about a teaspoon of powdered ginger use olive oil in place of cooking oil for cooking the vegtables of coarse still useing the sesame oil as indicated for its wonderful flavor mix yellow and red peppers for color and if you have a favorite hot pepper use it with or in place of the red peper flakes but still use the ground black pepper! I hope you like my little modifcations. Is more sour (VINIGER) with a nice texture (CORN STARCH) and warm after taste (FAVORITE PEPER plus the GINGER!)",

It's not all that bad a soup, but make no mistake: This is NOT even close to The Real Thing!  The bell pepper is unnecessary, and where are the bamboo shoots?

I use 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 4 oz tofu 4 oz pork tenderloin cut into strips 2 cloves crushed garlic 1 egg gently folded in towards the end mushrooms and some canned bamboo shoots cut into strips. To make things real authentic you should probably use shiitake and broken tree ear mushrooms...but I'm usually lazy and just toss in some from a can until it looks good!:P Absolutley NO bell peppers of any sort!! I've never seen this in a real restaraunt! I don't use water chesnuts either...not only do I just not like them I've just never seen them in a restaraunt version! Everything else is pretty much the same!! Hope this helps with some of the complaints I've been hearing!!",

If called something else I might have given this recipe four stars but since the recipe is called hot and sour soup I'm rating it relative to it's claim of being a hot and sour soup. Relative to other hot and sour soups I've had this was quite marginal.",
