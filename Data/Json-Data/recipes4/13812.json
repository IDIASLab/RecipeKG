The cranberries & pecans incorperated through out the dough & I was nervous that they wouldn't. I did opt for a loaf pan cause I needed to store in fridge overnight before baking. I allowed for extra rising time & baked the same way. I did use a 9 5/8\" x 5 1/2\" x 2 3/4\" pan cause the smaller common loaf pan wouldn't have been large enough.",
