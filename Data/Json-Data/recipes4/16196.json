These were lighter, crisped up well, and were so wholesome.  I thought I had dome half whole wheat, half unbleached white flour but I didn't. Did all white accidentally.  Would prefer the whole wheat.  We use oat flour regularly so I knew that would be great. I did add cinnamon.  I also doubled it thinking, if this only made 6 waffles, I'd for sure need more for my family of 5 (well, 4 and a 1 year old who only ate 1.5 waffles).  I use a square waffle mater - two waffles side-by-side.  Doubled, this made about 24 waffles.  Wowee!  I'm sure they freeze well, as waffles do.  So, beware, for that size of waffles, it's making more than 6.",
