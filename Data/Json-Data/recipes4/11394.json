I also line the bread pan with wax paper that allows me to remove it from the pan and makes it easier to slice.",

Very easy to make it just takes quite a long time.  I think next time I'll probably cut back on the cooking time for the steel cut oats because I had about an inch stuck to the bottom of my crock pot when I finished the 90 minutes.  Also, it might be easier to take all the ingredients after the oats are cooked, and mix them in a large bowl before transferring them back into the crockpot because it was hard to mix all together in the crockpot.  I just went ahead and refrigerated this overnight because it took so long we went out to eat and I finished cooking the goetta the next morning.  I might consider trying to cut this recipe in half next time because it makes a ton.  I'm used to making big meals, but this was just overwhelming.  It completely fills the crockpot.  And when your only cutting thin slices to fry it goes a long way.  I'm thinking about freezing the leftovers.  I'm not sure if that will work out in the end, but it's worth a try.  If you like to cook and don't mind the time it takes, and like to try new things, especially foods from Germany, Hungary, Poland, ect. try this I think it's worth it.",

He said it was delicious.  Since it made so much, I gave my dad a 'loaf' and he says it's the best he's ever had.  I usually don't fry my goetta in oil or butter, but rely on the fat in the product.   I'll use butter or a little bit of oil next time since the fat was absorbed by the oats.  I had little refrigerator space and it was late when the product finished cooking, so I put the mixture into a 9 x 13 pan, evened it out and let it cool off a bit at room temperature before putting it into the refrigerator.  The next morning, I turned it out onto waxed paper and cut it into 3 loaves.  I plan to freeze the 3rd- but next time, I'll cut the recipe in half.",

Another thing don't use anything other than just plain pork sausage or you will alter the true authentic taste. A lot of people commented that it would fall apart. I believe the problem is that there is no gelatin in the mix to hold it together. Recipes handed down within families call for the boiling of either a pork shoulder or butt with the bone and then using that broth for your \"steel cut\" pin oats. The boiling of the meat (bone) produces the gelatin that ultimately keeps it together. Its a little more work having the grind the meat and all but the outcome is significant.",

I must admit I was a little skeptical when shortly after our wedding she gave me a pan to fix for him.  I have since come to love it.  She generally used pork, but was also known to mix in beef and even chicken.  In later years she used greased aluminum mini loaf pans to cool and then freeze her goetta.  I enjoy my goetta with eggs and toast.  My husband prefers his just like his grandma, served on fresh bread drizzled with syrup.  Thank you so much for a simpler way to bring our children a little family heritage at the breakfast table.  I have introduced much of my extended family to goetta and now many of them love the stuff too.  We have even had get togethers in the fall just to make large batches of the stove top kind.  I can\u2019t wait to share this recipe with them so they can enjoy goetta anytime.  By the way, we\u2019re from Indiana.  I have had questions about the oats before.  We use Dorsel\u2019s Pinhead Oatmeal.  Thank you again Sarge!",

Also I halved the recipe and it's a good thing because my large crock pot was filled to the max once the oatmeal cooked. This must be an aquired taste. The texture was just horrid. Perhaps about one-fourth the quantity of oatmeal would make it better.",
