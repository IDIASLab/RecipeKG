I kept wondering, \"Sauce - what sauce?\"  Melted butter is not sauce, it's melted butter.  A lot of melted butter.   So I did it my own way - rubbing the tenderloin with a mix of the garlic, balsamic vinegar, some salt and pepper and some olive oil.  Because I had it in the oven with a a mashed potato dish and acorn squash, I changed the baking temperature to 400 degrees (which I prefer for roasting tenderloin anyway) and baked  it for 25 minutes.  I made the gravy with the drippings and a dab of butter  at the end, then stirred in the mushrooms.  It was delicious.  Too much garlic, but still delicious.",
