They are definitely healthier than the fried ones or even the baked ones using melted butter, olive oil or mayo as part of the breading process. I was hoping to taste the pecans, but the taste of the crackers was predominant. Also, despite the spices added to the pecans/crackers mix, the chicken was still little bland for me. I did cut the cayenne by half because of the kids, but the whole amount would have just made the chicken spicier, not more flavorful. Last, I want to mention that the oven temperature and the baking time were the right combination and  the spraying of the chicken with Pam seemed to help the breading stay compact. I will be using this \"trick\" when ever I bake breaded chicken or fish. If I make this recipe in the future, I will season the chicken 1st and use more pecan and less crackers.",
