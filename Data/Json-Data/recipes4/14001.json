I made it again this year with a few adjustments. I cut the recipe in half then I doubled or tripled all the veggies. I did not pre-cook the veggies I just threw everything into the crock pot because I was short on time and a few hours in a crock pot will turn them into mush anyway. I put in only half of the \"better than bouillon soup base - as it has a lot more sodium than the nutritional info in the recipe seems to imply. I crushed two big cloves of garlic and chopped up only about 3 chipotle peppers from the can and added them and whatever sauce was sticking on them into the crock pot. (Two large and one smaller one.) I'd say that the majority of Americans would still find the result to be quite spicy. Be careful with those chipotle peppers and Adobo sauce! I guess I was not supposed to soak the black-eyed peas overnight so the result is a little soupier than expected and was ready more quickly than the recipe states. But that worked out well because I skipped lunch so I was hungry early. And it was yummy-licious and I'll have to make it again soon!",
