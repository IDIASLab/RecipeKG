Tip for beginning cooks: when a chili recipe includes tomato \"sauce\" it doesn't mean pasta sauce but something like Hunt's \"tomato sauce\" which is basically tomato puree w/ a little salt. In fact canned tomato puree works just as well. I also love that this recipe used fresh onions peppers and garlic. I added 2 t. dried marjoram and 1/8 t. cinnamon to compensate for the milder turkey taste. For a potluck I enjoy making this in a Dutch oven then mixing up a batch of Southern-style unsweetened cornbread batter pouring it on top of the chili and baking the whole thing uncovered on the top rack of a 375 F oven until the cornbread is set and lightly browned.",
