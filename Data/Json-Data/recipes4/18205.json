I\u2019ve made chia milk before so decided on this but needed a basic recipe again. I didn\u2019t have time to soak anything so placed white chia seed and a few cashews in the water and let it sit for about 5 minutes. I blended thoroughly in my high-speed blender and strained it in a nut milk bag. I always add Stevia and several pimches of Himalayan salt to make it taste more like regular milk. Tasted fabulous, smooth, full, and creamy. My son loved it in his strawberry protein smoothie with some blueberries added.",

I only have a regular blender so the seeds were still crunchy. I imagine with a mega blender you'd get a smoother consistency. The recipe works exactly as written. I made a half batch with honey and half without. Haven't used it for baking yet but will. The sweetened version went well in a smoothie making it a bit thicker than when using a more viscous milk alternative. Thank you for the recipe.",
