This way, you can eliminate the onion as well as the saute pan. The green and red bell peppers give it a little extra punch -- you can even eliminate the soup entirely.  I also like using sharp cheddar instead of the mild and, in addition, mix about 1/4 c. shredded sharp cheddar with the corn flakes; crushing together in a ziploc.  I use only one dish to mix and bake, and grease it with margarine or butter. Also, I've always baked it at 375 degrees to ensure there are no \"cold spots\". No one ever tires of this recipe!",

I recommend: boosting the cheese to 3 or 4 cups; replacing the first stick of butter with just enough olive oil to saute the onions; using only a half-stick for the corn flakes (moisten the flakes in skillet with the melted butter); and mixing all the contents together rather than layering them. Depending on your oven, you also can reduce the temp to 400, I'd say. I'd bake it 50 minutes before adding the butter-moistened corn flakes, and then bake for another 20 minutes.",

I've made it lower fat by using Smart Balance instead of butter, lowfat sour cream, and less cheese, and although it doesn't hold a candle to the 'drenched in real butter' original, it's still good.  I bake it without the corn flakes for 40-45 minutes, then add them during the last 15.  They end up nice and crispy, but not burnt.",
