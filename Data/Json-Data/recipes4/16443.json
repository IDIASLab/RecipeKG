It's also great on those cold winter days where suppers call for a hot and delicious soup. A combination of sausage and vegetable in a beefy broth. This may be made a day in advance. Tastes even better the second day. Enjoy!",

Was. FABULOUS!!  I did make a some changes to the recipe, though, using what I had on hand: I used Italian seasoning (generously) instead of sage. I used fat free chicken broth instead of bullion cubes. My sausage was mild Italian pork sausage instead of turkey, and I didn't have parsley. I also added some orzo, to give it a little more \"fill\". It smelled and tasted like the sausage lentil soup from Carrabbas restaurant which is a family favorite. It was a big hit with my teenage boys. Definitely making it again.",

When sausage brown I scraped fond clear with 2 TBSP of Marsala wine,  then  added carrots, garlic, beans my husband had soaked in water plus one can of Garbanzo beans, 3 chopped Fingerling potatoes, about a cup of beef broth  and a bay leaf. Couldn't find my sage so used 21 Gun Seasoning from TJ. I let it simmer and added fresh Dill and the parsley plus 4 oz Heavy Whipping cream. Wow so good! In high rotation here! I know, a lot of tweaking but this is a very adaptable recipe. Hats off to the submitter!",

Added about 6 cups of water plus a few beef bouillon cubes and cooked in my Instant Pot for about 35 minutes (I added the extra water to compensate for the dry beans). Kept with the original seasoning but at the end decided to add some Italian seasoning at the end to top it off. It was yummy but I needed a bit more texture to it so I added some ditalini pasta...
