Cook your roast in a slow cooker for 6 hours untill it easily shreds. you want to cook the roast in beef bullion cubes and water (about 5-10 depending on size of roast ) once your beef is ready and cool. Add about 1-2 tbs of fresh chopped parsley and 1-2 tbs of thyme puree half a yellow onion and add to meat mix and a tsp of black pepper. Now to get the real kick that the dutch love you need a spice called \" gehaktkruiden\" which can be purchased at a dutch foods specialty store. If you cant get this add the paprika but do try to find this dutch spice as it really does give it the flavor you need. and add to your taste. Set your beef aside and now make your \"bechamel\" sauce in a sauce pan melt 1/3 c of butter add 1/3 c of flour and mix in 1 c of warm milk ( preferably homo or 2%) add a pinch of salt to taste. this will make a paste that you add to the meat. mix in real well and store in fridge over night. shape into cylinders roll in flour and dip in beaten egg then roll in the bead crumb coating repeat. deep fry and serve with mustard. If you are not serving right away put in freezer and fry them when you need them. enjoy!",

Take a roast (beef in my mind is best) cook it in the crockpot for the day (this is why people don't make krokets often its an all day affair) shred the beef make a roux throw in some ketjap manis mustard (i prefer spicy) roll those bad boys into balls (biterballen) or oblong (kroket). To bread them this is a three step process flour egg then bread crumbs. Deep fry. A sign of a good kroket is the breading is separated from the filling after its cooked. There is no true recipe for krokets taste your way through. If you don't like the way it tastes change it.",
