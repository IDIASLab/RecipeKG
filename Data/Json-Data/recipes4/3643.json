However I don't get the point of cooking chicken separately and then marinating it - I used my slow cooker to cook my chicken breasts IN the marinade and it turned out great. Only took about three hours on HIGH and the chicken was falling apart on its own and saturated in flavor. There was still some honey/lime juice left in the slow cooker to add to the enchilada sauce. I also put a dollop of sour cream in both the chicken mixture and the sauce on top and used about half the cheese called for a mexican blend and some sharp cheddar. Served on a bed of lettuce - tasty!",
