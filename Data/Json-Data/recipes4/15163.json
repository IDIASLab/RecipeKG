The instructions on cooking the Isreali couscous are very different than the package instructions. I tried it this way and after 25 minutes the liquid was not absorbed and the couscous wasn't tender. Toast the couscous in a little olive oil - add the boiling water - cover and simmer on very low for 10 - 12 minutes until the water is absorbed. I made this for the Western Region Allstar Faceless Frenzy July 2012. With the changes mentioned above I will definitely make this again.",

Only add the 1 clove of garlic - seems like it's too little but mixed with the onion made it perfect. Also I used 1 teaspoon of balsamic GLAZE and 1 teaspoon of red wine vinegar instead. Added a touch more fresh basil as well. Was amazing!!! Serve room temp otherwise will loose flavor when too cold. Excellent! Will definitely make again!! UPDATE NOTE make this salad right before you are eating it-- room temp - does not hold well in fridge -- couscous sucks up the olive oil and gets very mushy only good on first day!!",
