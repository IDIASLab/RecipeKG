I used 2 cups of milk 2 Tbsp butter 1/2 cup white cornmeal salt and pepper to taste and 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese...yummy!!!!!",

I then topped them with some mushroom gravy. SO YUMMY!!!! Thank you very much for this recipe.",

I'd just like to give my experience with attempting to fry the polenta. I'd never done it so my first batch I tried in my fake French cast-iron skillet. They stuck and left me with a horrible mush of fried skin and greasy polenta. The trick is to use a non-stick pan. Cover the bottom with 1/4 inch of oil. Heat the oil to medium-high but make sure that it's HOT before you slide the polenta pieces into the pan. Let them cook until you can see the sides of the pieces browning. Lift with a spatula - if it sticks leave it for a moment or two longer. Flip allow to brown and presto! Tasty fried polenta that is crisp on the outside and creamy delicious on the inside! Hope that helps!",
