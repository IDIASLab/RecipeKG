I usually tone it down to 1 pepper and about a tablespoon or two of the sauce and it still has a nice bite to it.",

I had no fresh red or green peppers but I did have jarred roasted red peppers so I used those. Used sweet onion in place of red (had none on hand). I did reduce the amount of chipotles and adobo sauce as per the submitters review because my little guy was eating this too whhich ended up being the perfect amount of heat for us and I had to use dried dill because I had no fresh. This had a wonderfully different flavor from any other potato salads that I've had. I am a lover of chipotle so I knew this was gonna be a hit and it was...my little guy had 2 helpings! Thanks for this delicious new way to make potato salad. I will be making it often! Thanks for sharing.:)",
