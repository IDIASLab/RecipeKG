Just sprinkled the garlic powder with fresh crushed pepper sprinkled on the chicken and mixed the cheese with the pesto, very yummy!! I also omitted the salt, I had pre-packaged pesto which was pretty salty. I also did not use the full 1/4 cup of olive oil, because it seemed like a lot, just sprinkled it over the chicken before baking.  Not too many changes but they suited my family's tastes, as I am sure the recipe is just fine as written. A great way to use up extra pesto and chicken!!!",

                "reviewBody": "Made this last night....I did not use the oil. I know one review said that it was very messy to make not the case at all. I'm not sure how she went about it but if they gave us every tiny detail then we wouldn't be good cooks now would we. I made my own pesto using raw pine nuts olive oil garlic parmessan cheese and of course fresh basil- just eyeball it to get the correct taste and consistency. I think that was the trick for me. I used 1/2 a breast and pounded with the spike side of my pampered chef tenderizer on both sides of the chicken. The pesto spread easily with a small rubber spatula I added just a tiny bit of salt and fresh cracked pepper rolled it and then wrapped the bacon and then a little more cracked pepper on top-keep in mind bacon is already salty you don't want to over do it. I placed it on an elevated rack so the fat could drip down and baked for 20 minutes at 350 and then about 18 minutes more at 400. This kept the breasts moist and made the bacon crispy. Again I'm not sure why another complaint was about the bacon not being crispy. If you look at my photo you can clearly see it is cooked crispy enough. We paired it with a simple salad but this would be great served over noodles with a touch of olive oil garlic and parmessan or over a bed of garlic mash....it's a simple dish packed with good flavor. Enjoy!",
