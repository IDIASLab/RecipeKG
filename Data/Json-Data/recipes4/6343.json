We've made it several times.\n\nThings I've ended up doing different:\n-Add chicken after a few hours - we feel it gets to dry when it's in from the beginning.\n-Use shrimp instead of ham - which we don't add until the last hour or 2 of cooking.\n-Add 1.5c white rice at the last hour or two - this is scary to do, but if you give it enough time, eventually the rice cooks perfect and absorbs the extra liquid.\n-No file powder - what is that anyway??",

I used the published amounts of chicken and sausage, but halved the ham and added about 6 oz shrimp at the end of cooking.  I used the spices exactly as published including the file powder, delicious, I would call this a medium spicy hot finished.  You may want to half or omit the cayanne if you don't like spicy, but it was perfect for us.  This is a breeze to put together and great for weeknights.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!",

I also used dice tomatoes w/ green chiles. I then put it all in the crock pot on high for 4 hours. About an hour before I was ready to eat I made 1.5 cups of white rice & added that to the crock pot then left that in there on warm for another hour. The only thing I would change is the cayenne pepper. My tongue LOVES spicy but my stomach hates it. I would only put 1/2 TSP next time 1 TSP really gives it a kick. I also didn't use file powder. It was freaking delicious though. Especially adding the rice & letting that soak all the flavors for an hour. Yum.",

We substituted fresh shrimp in place of the ham added the last 30 minutes of cook time. I added rice the last hour and half and in order to get it to actually cook I had to add a cup or 2 of chicken broth and then the rice became mushy but it was still worth it. I would recommend making this without the rice and just serve it over cooked rice. We really enjoyed this. I will make it again.
