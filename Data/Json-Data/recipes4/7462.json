I was expecting a lot of flavor from the chile/mustard \"sauce\" but it didn't really shine through (and I halved the recipe for 2 sandwiches and used 1/2 of the sauce per sandwich more than the recipe calls for). I really liked how easy it was to make AND the added instructions for freezing. THANKS for the recipe!",
