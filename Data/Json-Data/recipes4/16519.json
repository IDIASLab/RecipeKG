I took my French fry recipe and converted it slightly, though the soaking in vinegar idea was my mom's! I hope your family likes them as much as mine did! These are excellent for a cookout; make them a day ahead and surprise everybody!",

My concern is step 5 -  \"Working in batches, use a slotted spoon to remove potato slices from vinegar mixture and gently add to the hot oil.\"   WARNING! This is darned right dangerous! Putting wet anything into hot oil can cause FIRE and splatter burns.  Please, if you make this recipe, pat the potatoes dry or spin them in a salad spinner to dry them before adding to the hot oil.  This has you first soaking the potatoes in cold water to remove the starch, which is great and then patting them dry - I don't know why because you then place them in a vinegar / water bath to soak again. The recipe does not have you drying the potatoes before frying. All that said, these did have a good flavor - the thinner the potato slices the better the chips.  I used my food processor slicing attachment, if you don't put any pressure on the potato to force it down the slicing blade will cut paper thin potato slices in no time at all.",

I soaked my potatoes overnight in the vinegar and still was unable to achieve any taste. I was also unable to achieve any crispness from this method without a ton of color. I have sprinkled more vinegar on my chips after I took them out of my fry pan and I am baking them in the oven at 170 to dry them back out. I am optimistic that I will be able to keep some flavor this way. I think next time I will only fry them pale then finish off in the oven after I give them a good vinegar spray bath.",
