I am excited to try the batch that comes out of the bird. One batch makes enough to fit in a smaller bird plus a 9 by 9 pan.",

First, I sauteed all of the veggies briefly (I also added a small stalk of celery).  I think I chopped the mushrooms too big, next time I would chop finely.  I used pumpkin seeds instead of pine nuts, and I did half raisin/half dried cranberry.  I used veggie broth instead of water.\n\nWith some modifications, I would serve this at Thanksgiving alongside a Tofurkey. :)",
