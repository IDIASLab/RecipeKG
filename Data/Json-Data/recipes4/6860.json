Experiment with the quantities since I really added what was already here in my kitchen at the time. I thought it would be dry, but it wasn't. As a precaution, I made a warm cheese sauce for adding on top while eating. It wasn't necessary, but it was delicious. Enjoy!",

I used fresh baby bella mushrooms because I'm not a fan of cans but other than that followed the recipe (sans the green onion; I couldn't see buying them for such a scant amount). The end result was quite watery (the tomatoes?) and the potatoes weren't quite done despite a very thin cut. Mr. LTH thought it was \"fine\" but I found myself picking out the mozzarella!

I boiled the potatoes in very salty water until al dente before adding to the casserole dish subbed bacon for prosciutto used regular onion instead of green saut\u00e9ed the onion in the bacon grease and omitted mushrooms. I am glad I boiled the potatoes first. I think this is a nice base recipe that you can change up any way you like. I recommend a lot more seasoning.",
