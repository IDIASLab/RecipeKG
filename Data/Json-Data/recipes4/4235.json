I adjusted the amount of the ingredients to accomodate my portions.  I used miracle whip, infused with fresh smashed garlic, dried basil, oregano, rosemary and a bit of sea salt.  Rubbed the mayo mixture on both sides of chicken placed the aspargus inside chicken, then shredded mozzarella, rolled and placed toothpicks through chicken and asparagus as mine were quite large.  Then rolled each piece in Panko bread crumbs and placed in (pam sprayed) glass baking dish.  Placed in oven for 45 minutes (covered after 25 minutes).  As they were baking in oven, I sauteed fresh portabella mushrooms in olive oil, a bit of butter and sherry.  Poured the mixture over the top of chicken breasts and baked for another 10 minutes uncovered.  I believe my chicken breasts took longer due to the size of the breasts and my aspargus as well.  DELISH!!!!  VERY VERY GOOD!!!  I very rarely follow a recipe to the T, just because that is how I am.  (I love to cook) and I give this recipe 5* just for giving me another great recipe and NEW idea!  THANKS!  Everyone from 8 years old to 54 years old LOVED this recipe.  Also, I served with long grain wild rice.",

I read the other reviews and decided to spread pesto on the inside and outside of the chicken. I pounded out the chicken and then brushed pesto on it before rolling and then brushed pesto on the outside before sprinkling on the breadcrumbs. I went a little too easy on the cheese on the inside and would probably add more next time since most of it tends to melt out the sides (which makes for great crispy cheesy goodness if you use a spatula).",
