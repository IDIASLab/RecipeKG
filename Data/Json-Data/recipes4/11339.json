We tried to make it a from-scratch Thanksgiving this year and everything turned out great including these beans!!. We threw 1/2 a pound of beans (enough for a side dish for 2) 4 slices of pan-fried bacon cut up in lieu of the hamhock (if we do bacon again we'll do 2 slices) and 2 tbsp of brown sugar into the mix for fun and the beans came out with just the right amount of sweet & salty (the bacon ended up a little sweet though so next time we'll try ham).. We cooked them on high in the crockpot for 20 minutes then low for the next 3 1/2 hours while the turkey took its time. The beans turned out deliciously just the right amount of tenderness and firmness and a great flavor.:)",
