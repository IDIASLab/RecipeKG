It tasted very similar to a good bottled spaghetti sauce but I didnt have to go to the store and buy it since I keep all of these ingredients on hand all the time. I used it in the \"Pasta Lasagna\" recipe. It was a huge hit. My 6 year old daughter ate 3 (small) plates full and it's rare that I can get her to eat more than 2 or 3 bites at dinner time. She actually asked if she could have a third plate of this instead of a piece of the Valentine's day ice cream cake I brought home. That was shocking. I was really surprised at how easy this was too. I used the exact amount of seasoning and all other ingredients just as the recipe is written and I am not sure why others leave the bell pepper out (unless they just didn't have any) because that gives it a great flavor. Great!",

I added some parsley and oregano heated it up and that was it. It got an \"mmmm\" from my 22-month-old. I decided to skip the chicken broth and tomato paste because I wanted the fresh taste of the Muir Glen tomatoes to be front and center and I didn't want to spend an extra 20 minutes making the sauce.
