Put pepper upside down (tops cut off and cleaned out already) in the water and cover.  Boil for 5 minutes.  They are now ready to stuff and don't need as much time in the oven - other than to heat up or cook whatever filling.  \nThis recipe did need a lot of additional spices - I put about 1.5 Tbs. seasoned salt, 2 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp. red pepper flakes, and 1 tsp. garlic powder.  Also put some shredded cheddar in the filling as well.",

I added a whole 15 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of just a cup and Italian seasonings as well as some crushed pepper for a little kick. I also added some cheddar cheese inside as well as on top instead of the mozzarella cheese I think the sharpness of the cheddar was a good addition. I also kept the peppers cooking at least 10 minute longer than the recipe said and I still think that it was too crisp tender for me so I next time would probably either microwave or cook the peppers a little bit before adding the filling and cooking it the 18 plus minutes. Otherwise a great recipe- very healthy yet tasty.",

That gave it amazing flavour. 2) I added more garlic to the onions (double). 3) I added a little cheese to the mixture (I think that also helped hold it together). 4) I used 2/3 c Randa pasta sauce (with Basil) and 1/3 c canned tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce. This North African brand really added a nice kick! 5) I Baked the peppers (whole) for 10-15 min on 350 by themselves. I let them cool -- then cut the tops off, seeded them, and stuffed them. I made sure the stuffing was really packed in! Then I let them sit a while (while I prepared the other parts of this big meal) and baked them for 20 min in the oven to finish the cooking. I think in that sitting time, the flavours also mingled! Very yummy results -- they were a hit!",

Seeing the comments about the blandness I would like to offer up what I now plan on doing when I make this. I love quiona and it is excellent if you saute diced celery onion and carrot. Add a little chicken broth and throw in currants dried cranberries and diced apricots a little cinnamon and cardamon. Add the cooked quinoa and the tomatoes if you like. Then fill the peppers. When I make stuffed peppers I usually slice them longways and lay them down on top of some seasoned tomato sauce and chicken broth. This seems to amp up the flavor of the pepper.",
