And surprisingly, I did.  A tip- when you lay the bok choy in the pan to simmer, leave the lid off the pan, otherwise your bok choy will get limp and water-logged. Also, I made the mistake of using chicken broth instead of stock, assuming that when I left the sauce to simmer it would thicken up. It does not, and my sauce was watery. Rookie mistake, I'm sure. In my opinion, it's best to leave just a tad of the bok choy stem on, otherwise when you halve them you just end up with a handful of bok choy leaves. In all fairness, had I not made these mistakes I'm sure I actually would have loved this recipe and given it five stars.",
