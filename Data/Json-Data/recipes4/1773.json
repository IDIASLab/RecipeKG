(Use a ruler and make small marks with a pen as you circle the pumpkin measuring from the bottom up.) Cut along your dotted line and discard the top. It is best to wrap the whole pumpkin in aluminum foil during baking to prevent browning but remove the foil from the top for the last 15 minutes to allow the casserole to brown a little. Cooking time varies a little so I can't be more specific but 1 1/2 hours is about right. I like to scoop out a little of the cooked pumpkin with each serving but that's up to you! Now that my children are grown I don't use the pumpkin anymore - I just use a 9x13 pan make 2 layers and bake at 350 for 25 minutes covered and 10 minutes uncovered. I hope this helps!",

The first year--looked elegant-pumpkin wasn't cooked through--noone ate it but me.  Second year--pumpkin cooked through bc I cooked it for awhile first, took it out and stuffed it.  It isn't worth the effort unless you are a vegetarian as everyone at my table are meat eaters and they love the stuffing in the bird and noone touched this but me as I wanted to sample it.  It also takes up the entire oven so again for a vegetarian who isn't having a bird and and several other sides, this may work.  I used a roaster for my turker but I still would prefer other sides to this. It does give an excellent presentation on the table; however, I'll stick to the turkey as my main table decoration in the future. The proportions were way off and the size pumpkin wasn't mentioned so the amount listed for ingredients was way off. If I'm going to pay for a pumpkin, I want to be able to eat it too.",
