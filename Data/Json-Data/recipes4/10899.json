I do not think that the added salt is necessary, as kielbasa, beef broth and butter all contain salt.\n\nI have made this recipe and variations of it several times.  To make it a bit more healthful, I now omit the butter and simply saute the kielbasa with the onion and then drain off the excess fat.  I also omit the salt and the sour cream.  It is just as yummy and I do not feel guilty eating it!\n\nTo tonight's variation I added about 2 c. more cabbage, 1 c. frozen corn, 1 1/2 c. frozen cooked great northern beans (I buy dry beans, then cook and freeze them for later use), 2 medium potatoes, cubed.  The beans and potatoes cook down enough to thicken the broth a bit.  I served it with homemade garlic toast.  DElicious!\n\nI made the garlic toast using leftover crusty bread slices which I buttered with a mixture of 4 T. softened butter mixed with 2 large cloves of garlic, minced.  Placed them on a baking sheet under the broiler at high temp for about 2-3 minutes.  Keep your eye on them or you'll have garlic toast flambe!",

This stew works well with kielbasa, brats or Italian sausage. I use canned tomato sauce instead of tomato soup as I find the soup too sweet. I also add a little garlic powder. This recipe is SO versatile! Thanks, Jo!",
