Just mash them a bit and they will break down as they cook. I also use red wine vinegar which adds a nice flavor. You can make this in a deep skillet on the stove and you don't need to brown the meat first. It's amazing. And it will take a tough cut of meat and make it very tender. I serve it over rice or mashed potatoes to soak up the sauce. I've never tried it in the crockpot though. An all around great recipe.",
