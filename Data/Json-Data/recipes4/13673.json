With this recipe the homemade stock makes all the difference--well worth the effort. Although the only spices are salt and pepper the combination of the roasted turkey flavor with the subtle nuance the root vegetables add is wonderful. This was a clear winner with my family too. The nutritional info has to be wrong though. I can't see where 2 200 calories per serving is right.",
