I also used a tablespoon of fresh rosemary instead of the dried because I had it on hand and I like to use fresh herbs whenever possible. I'm not a big fan of balsamic vinegar so I used regular white vinegar instead. I'm not so sure I liked the taste of the vinegar in here...I would probably skip it next time I make this. But of course that's a personal preference since I don't like the taste of balsamic vinegar. I also found that it took longer to bake than the 40 minutes specified in the recipe. Other than that this is a great recipe and I will probably make it again. Thanks for sharing1",
