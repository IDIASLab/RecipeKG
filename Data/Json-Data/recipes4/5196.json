The true center of this recipe is the braising of the beef. I went beyond my usual Carmel color and went ahead to an almost blacked meat. \n\nThe reward was some of the most beautiful sauce I've ever had in a pot roast. About 1/2 an hour before completion I added several quartered potatoes just because and the sauce made them the other star of this great meal.\n\nI've used several of your recipes over the past year or so but really wanted to provide comment on this one as one of your finest. \n\nGood old fashioned America cooking on steroids!

The flour is not necessary- use a nonstick pan to brown the meat.   If you want to use flour to thicken the liquid, it should be added near the end- long cooking will destroy most of it's thickening ability..  I have no idea what the food industry has against beef stock, but it's a better choice here (and many other places) than chicken.",

I used a 3.13 pound boneless roast (for 2 people with leftovers) and seared it until almost burnt on both sides, ie got nice dark coloring and a nice crust on the roast. Only additions/changes I did were: I quartered Yukon Gold potatoes (like 6-8 potatoes) and put them in with the celery and carrots at the bottom of the pot. I put the roast right from the searing pan into the crock pot on top of the veggies and let it rest in there instead. I used Beef Broth instead of Chicken Broth and got a great rich flavor and I added 1 Tablespoon Low Sodium Worcestershire to the mushroom/onion/broth mixture and let simmer before I poured over the meat. It smelled great when I walked in the door and made a great dinner (and leftovers) on a cold October night after work! Highly recommend!!!! Thanks Chef John!",

The only things I did differently were to use beef broth instead of chicken broth (seems a better fit, reinforces the beef flavor), and deglazed the mushroom/onion mixture with 1 cup of red wine (scrape the bottom to get all the good bits, then simmer until the wine is reduced), and then used just one cup of beef broth. Nothing smells better than pot roast cooking all day long in your home! I posted the recipe and photos in my blog, www.culinaryspirits.wordpress.com .",
