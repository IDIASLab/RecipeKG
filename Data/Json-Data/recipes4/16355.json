I let the frozen potatoes thaw although they were still cold and I added a diced onion that I carmelized before adding.  I must say that like waffles, my first one did not come out.  My mistake was not spreading out the potatoes but piling it up in the center just like waffle batter.  That didn't work and it was a mushy pile after 20 minutes.  Once I spread it out thin, they cooked crispy and delicious.  I believe I would add more than one onion next time (this one was rather small) and a little more garlic salt.  Overall this was a good experience and we will do it again.  Thanks!",
