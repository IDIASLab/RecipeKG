The recipe didn't specify which type of potatoes to use, so I used yukon gold, which were great for this. These were a nice change from the usual potatoes, and I will definitely be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

That I was OK w/ though, b/c I actually like things overdone, but what I didn't jive w/ was the insane amount of oil. A 1/2 c. canola + 1/2 c. olive oil seemed like an amount better suited for frying rather than tossing and roasting, but oh well, I followed the recipe, and it was just too greasy for me. Husband kindly told me (as he happily ate his, maybe for my benefit and to not have to toss leftovers) that he wouldn't mind me making the recipe again, but drastically scaling back the oil(s).",

Outstanding flavor, tender but crispy, into the oven in eleven minutes.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes because that's what I like, and I did not peel them.  I stirred when I took off the foil and then again after 15 minutes.  Made it to go with Creamy Herbed Pork Chops from this site, and they were a marriage made in foodie heaven!  There was just a little potato leftover, and hubby heated it up to go with his eggs the next morning.  This qualifies as company food!",
