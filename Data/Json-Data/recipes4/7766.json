Make sure you season the fish well - garlic powder would be a nice addition here. And I'd also suggest seasoning the tomatoes. The fish was even tasty as leftovers for lunch! I baked the fish for 15 mins, then let it rest for 3-4 mins. This makes plenty of tomato topping, so you could even get away with using 3 or 4 pieces of fish. Thank you happycook for the tasty recipe!",

The only change I made was that I cooked the swai fish first in the oven on a perforated roasting pan to drain all the liquid from the fish (from frozen).
