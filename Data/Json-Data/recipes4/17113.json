I made this recipe up one afternoon and my family has been clamoring for these ever since! Really great flavors that meld together over the entire cooking time. They really are so good. They try to eat them right out of the pot! Serve with some hot sauce and vinegar on the side with your favorite meal. I promise you won't have any leftovers they are so good!",
