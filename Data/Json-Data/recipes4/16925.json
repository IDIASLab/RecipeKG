So I added a bit more baking soda the texture looked more efficient already. Poured it in skillet and it was denser this time but came out like half burnt scrambled eggs. Thought I screwed up THEN noticed the other review. The original poster REALLY needs to edit this as its really deceptive. I added in more flour. My third one I gave up right away and made scrambed as well. So glad I was making quinoa already as this recipe is a flop.",
