Some went in but first thing of a morning I wasn't going to make that great of an effort. So I put the rest of the cinnamon in a tea strainer knowing most of it would go right through. It did. So I used some kind of mesh fabric I had to strain the cinnamon out. Finally time for the taste test. I had read that the submitter said it was the only way she would drink black coffee. Hmmm. I hate black coffee but decided to give it a try. Crazy! But it IS really good black no cream at all. I think I have discovered my flavored coffee of preference this fall!",

Just make sure you fully mix the cinnamon into the grounds before adding to the filter. The filter does back up a bit with water so I wouldn't make a full pot of coffee and add the whole amount of cinnamon. As the submitter notes in the description just put a few more shakes of cinnamon for each extra cup. This is also good with other spices like pumpkin pie spice or cardamom.",
