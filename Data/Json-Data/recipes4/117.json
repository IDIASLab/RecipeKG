                "reviewBody": "This is a great recipe, no doubt.  There are a few points that should be emphasized.\n\nFirst, the instructions state that the mixture should be cooled before assembly.  This should be in capital letters.  There's something about letting the mixture set-up somewhat to reduce the amount of moisture...that thing that everyone is saying to avoid.  Excess moisture kills this dish.  I spun my spinach dry before chopping it and adding it to the pan, but go to great lenghts to introduce as little extra moisture as possible.  On the subject of spinach, I think the recipe implies the dirty bunch-spinach, not the pre-washed baby spinach.  I found I lost about 1/3 weight from the bunch spinach after discarding the undesirables and destemming.  Baby spinach is more expensive, but you can take it right out of the container, chop it and throw it in the pan.  If you use bunch spinach, account for the extra time it'll take you to clean and destem the stuff...huge PITA, but much cheaper.  Also, you can't go wrong with extra phyllo.  I wouldn't layer it in the middle, because it'll just be a doughy mess between the layers of filling. But to have eight sheets on the top AND bottom would not do you wrong.\n\nFinally, I found this dish rocks coming out of the freezer and going right into the oven.  Prepare it the same just to the point it goes in the oven.  Take the whole frozen kit and caboodle right to the oven, add some extra cooking time (20-30 mins) and it turns out identical.",

Just place the spinach on a plate, cover it with another plate (same side up).  Holding vertically, press the two plates together, over the sink, until liquid stops flowing.  Result = VERY dry spinach!  Using this method, I have never had a sogginess problem with this recipe.",

Never used phyllo dough before, so relied heavily on advice from other reviewers & my own preferences:  1) sauteed onion/garlic in 2 T butter/1 T olive oil for more flavor; 2) increased green onions to 2 bunches; 3) doubled the garlic; 4) decreased the spinach (used 1 6-oz bag prewashed baby spinach + about another cup just because that was what I had); 5) decreased parsley to 1/4 cup; 6) added 2 T fresh dill to spinach/onion mixture at the end (didn't cook it; dill too fragile; just let it get warmed by rest of mixture; 7) drained spinach mixture in a fine strainer while I worked on filling & dough; 8) doubled the feta; 9) added fresh ground pepper to the filling 10) brushed phyllo dough with butter rather than olive oil (for flavor & better browning; 11) used 9x13 baking pan; 12) used 8 sheets phyllo on bottom (4 laid out flat; then 4 more overlapping the pan, with HALF of spinach/cheese/egg mixture in those last four, folded over filling, sealing it in; then 4 more phyllo sheets overlapping pan with other HALF of filling, then folding those sheets over the filling, & topping that with 4 more phyllo sheets (butter brushed on each one from bottom to top).  This was DELICIOUS; it wasn't soggy & tasted like Greek restaurant food.  PS:  I also cut it into squares BEFORE baking it!  And the 2nd time I made it, I forgot to drain the spinach mixture, and the leftovers were definitely soggy the next day!  You're amazing, Silverwolf!",

I use frozen spinach (make sure to squeeze all the water out), use olive oil flavored cooking spray instead of brushing, omit the green onion, and occassionally use ricotta.  I am a fan of the traditional triangular shapes so i layer 2-3 sheets of fillo per triangle.  to keep dough from becoming a sticky or dried out mess, make sure its fully thawed before use, and properly covered while working.  plastic wrap and dishtowel does the trick.  the biggest problem i have with this recipe is: THERE ARE NEVER ANY LEFTOVERS!",

Two must have items for this recipe are fresh dill and freshly grated nutmeg (I use about 1/2 nut). The dill goes wonderfully with the spinach and green onions but the nutmeg is the key; it just adds a spark to all of the flavors and pulls everything together.\n\nMy other personal preferences are melted butter for the phyllo and I actually place phyllo on bottom, middle, and top like a lasagna. I use a 9 x 13 pan and generally use at least 10 sheets for each layer. I also bake covered in foil for first 30 minutes at 350 degrees. I then remove the foil and turn heat up to about 375 for another 10 minutes or so until phyllo lightly browns.\n\nIt really is a wonderful dish if you have never tried it and again, don't forget the dill and nutmeg...you won't be sorry!

                "reviewBody": "Very complete and user friendly recipie. I was a professional cook for 3 years at a 4 star restaurant, and know a user recipe. I made it last week, and it came out very tasty. I made it again today for a party, and this time using butter only, as the fat, i used 15 sheets of phyllo on the bottom then 1/2 the updated mixture, 10 sheets of phyllo, then the 2nd half of mixture, and topped with 15 more buttered sheets of phyllo. I used 4% cottage cheese (24 ounces) instead of ricotta, 24oz of crumbled feta, 5 cloves of fresh garlic, and 3 boxes of frozen spinach, 1 red onion diced, 2 eggs, 1/2 lemon juiced. This will make 15 servings, for it is 4\" high before baking. I used the method written in a review of squeezing the spinach between 2 plates to remove the liquid and it worked better than any other method I tried as a professional. Cheers",

I have never worked with fresh spinach before and did not remove the stems before putting it into the food processor.  The stems made it bitter and stringy.  REMOVE THE STEMS AND ONLY USE THE LEAVES and I'm sure you'll enjoy this much more than I did.  It looked great!",
