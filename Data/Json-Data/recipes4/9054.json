I enjoyed the addition of paprika and added a bit more than a pinch once I tasted it. I used smoked paprika and it gave such a nice earthy flavour it was hard to stop at just a pinch. This is a wonderful compliment to baked chicken. Thank you keithahaney for sharing this recipe.",

I added 5oz of cut-up white cheddar and 2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese. I finished with a small pat of salted butter. I omitted the salt listed in the recipe because this dish was salty enough with the stock cheeses and butter. This cooked up so quickly.

I used low sodium chicken broth because that's what I had available, and it was amazing! I would never use regular chicken broth for this recipe, since it tasted perfect! I also used a lot of paprika, not a dash. I highly recommend that you make this recipe, even if you don't have a fancy meal planned. You may want to eat it all. Remember you have to use a potato masher to break down the cubed polenta after removing the polenta from the heat (I think that's not written in the recipe). Enjoy!",
