I cut the recipe back to 1 portion I'm the only one that will eat shrimp that isn't grilled. I used unsalted crackers and shrimp that were 13/20 the cooking time is perfect for this size. The oil was heated until it shimmered but wasn't smoking. I served this over a bed of caesar salad for a complete meal. When I make this again I will leave the tails on for a better presentation. Thanks for sharing your Nan's recipe.",
