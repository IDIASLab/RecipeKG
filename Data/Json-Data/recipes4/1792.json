FINALLY I'VE GOT IT JUST RIGHT.  Mmmmmmmmmmmm, this is great!  THIS IS 1ST REVIEW I'm not a rosemary fan, so instead opted for 1/2 T. tarragon and 1/2 T. thyme. I wish I had read the reviews before making, don't get me wrong this has exceptional flavor, but way way way too salty. I could practically feel my ankles swelling. I'm wondering if maybe it should have been 2 teaspoons of salt rather then two tablespoons? With the soy sauce (which is already salty) it was a bit of a salt overkill, but I will definitely make it again, and again and again, just cut back the sodium.",

Given that the marinade ingredients were very similar to the seasonings Hubs uses for his grilled steaks, I kind of suspected it would be.  I used fresh rosemary rather than dried and eliminated the salt completely. The salt called for was not only unnecessary, but extraordinarily excessive, which is why this recipe falls one star short of perfect.  Otherwise, a rich and flavorful marinade that definitely complemented, rather than overpowered, our steaks.",

I didn't like the idea of pricking the steak because I didn't want to loose ANY juices so I found that marinating over night or at least 8 hours worked great.  I also added some liquid smoke and replaced half of the Worcestershire sauce with red wine, just my personal preference.  However, I don't think the salt and pepper are necessary in the marinade, just add it later after cooking if desired.",
