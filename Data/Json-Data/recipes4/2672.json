You can also add seasoned salt to the butter, which turns out great.  I like to cut open the potato and put the butter/salt inside instead of rubbing on the skin, but I'm sure that tastes good too.  The cooking time depends on how hot the flames are.  When the potatos are soft, they're ready.  It's a campfire, so it's not an exact science.",
