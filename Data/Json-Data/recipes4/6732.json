I sauteed up some seasoned (w/pepper & garlic) chicken pieces and added the to each layer with mushrooms and chopped kale. I used homemade sauce (don't like jarred). Each layer was roasted eggplant round, chicken pieces, mushrooms, kale, dollop of ricotta, sprinkle of grated parm and mozzarella and sauce. Top layer was everything but kale and ricotta cheese. Sprinkled with parsley and oregano. Baked 30 minutes covered. Remove foil, turned off oven, let sit in over 10 more minutes. Let sit for 5 out of oven. Extraordinary. Great way to get your eggplant and kale. You will love it.",
