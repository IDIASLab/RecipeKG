Anyway only a few comments, we did a triple batch (obvously more then one of us), I'd recommend keeping the butter at a 1/2 cup its more then enough.  We also used mozarella in addition to the cheddar, it was awesome.  The families own personal favorite is lobster with the mac and cheese, but you sothern folks could definitely substitute crawfish, I know I would if I could get them.  But just like the receipe says this is one awesome mac and cheese definitely 5 stars thanks for sharing Chris.",
