I will definitely make them again, but not without a couple changes. The \"1 large zucchini\" written for the original recipe, must've been from a mutant garden strain b/c I scaled the meat back to 1 lb. and ended up cramming 3 1/2 medium zucchinis with the meatloaf mixture, as well as making a couple random meatballs on the side. The end result was unfortunately on the bland side, (splash splash of Sriracha to the rescue!) so next time around, the meat and sauteed veggies need to be more heavily seasoned, possibly w/ more garlic, red pepper flakes, thyme, oregano, Italian Seasoning, etc... Also, I think I would rather prepare these like a stuffed bell pepper where I'd brown the meat prior to stuffing, then just pop the boats in the oven to melt the cheese, only b/c I wasn't too thrilled with the accumulation of grease in the zucchinis. Oh yeah, I also dropped it to 1 egg and 1/2 c. Italian bread crumbs, since I had a little less meat, and the bake time was dead-on. Overall a 3.5 star recipe that (CHEER! My 3-year old gobbled up!) might just need some tweaking b4 I'd make again.",

If all I have is ground chuck (with 15% fat) then you are better off browning the meat first and mixing then mixing it with some of the sauce. Terrific way to use zucchini when your garden is producing more than you can handle! Toss a salad & serve with crusty bread or garlic toast.",

Omit the bottled sauce and use your own or a low sodium brand. Omit the garlic salt completely and try garlic pepper you might be surprised. The Italian seasoned bread crumbs have a lot of salt and Parmesan plus the recipe calls for extra Parmesan and mozzarella. Make you your own bread crumbs with herbs no salt and just use the Parmesan as indicated in the recipe. Then try low fat Mozzarella. You can try ground turkey or chicken if you like but I do not think it will make much difference. I do cheat from low fat and low sodium diets but have found after very little time that a lot of recipes are very salty and although I love the velvety texture of some fat greasy and oily becomes very cloying.",

Then bake and season the \"boats\" first for -- ummmm, maybe half hour or more in order to get it cooked and dried out a little, as it tends to be watery if you don't.  \nCook the beef/pork in your frying pan ahead of time and add the things you'd like--green pepper, onion, garlic, seasonings, tomatoes or tomato sauce, etc. and taste it first so it's more to your taste.  When you stuff it, leave the cheese off until the last 10 or 15 minutes so it doesn't burn.",
