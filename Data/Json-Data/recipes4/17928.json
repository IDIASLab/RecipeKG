I made the batter into dough myself by adding more besan flour and a couple of eggs to make it stay together but it came apart as I was rolling it out. The only way to salvage it was to convert it back into batter again (which it was never meant to be in the first place). I have been using it for savoury pancakes. It has a pleasant flavour and as pancakes it goes well with a potato and pumpkin topping.",
