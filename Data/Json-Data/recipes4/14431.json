I added pineapple about 1/2 cup frozen chunks as well as about 1/3 cup orange juice to the sauce and removed the peppers (habanero and bell) due to little picky eaters. As the fish was broiling I added some frozen stir fry vegetables to the sauce and turned up the heat for about 7 minutes to get a nice citrus-y stir fry to top the fish. Ended up with those little picky eaters asking for seconds. Success!",

I will add a side  note here to suggest trying the Maui Onion salad dressing recipe on this site to use the papaya seeds - we have made it several times and always enjoy it.  Anyway, for this recipe -  the papaya I had on hand was not that flavorful, so I did decide to augment the ingredients here just a bit.  I did add some fresh pineapple chunks, and decided to add some ginger .  We enjoy spicy dishes, so I added more hot peppers than the recipe called for.   For us, overall result was great - the sauce had that spicy/sweet combination.   With rice and a side of  edamame, this made a very nice meal for us.   I will definitely make this again, it was a welcome change up to my rut of making pineapple mango salsa with fish.",
