I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of my substitutions - I didn't feel it was fair for me to rate the recipe based on my substitutions but we all thought it was delicious. We have no small children - the youngest at home is almost 21 so everyone eating this were all adults. I'll make it again but next time I'm going to use half a peach in the neck and use all water.

I have a beer can rack for grilling that I picked up at Big Lots years ago so it holds the chicken nice and steady. Rubbed garlic in the cavity stuffed an onion in the neck rubbed salt and pepper and squeezed some lime on the outside skin and I was ready to go in less than 15 minutes. A 5 lb chicken took about 1 hr 20 minutes in a 340 degree convection oven (but honestly my convection oven does not seem to cook THAT much faster)-what a wonderful inside grilling method. Definitely will be a repeat at my house!",
