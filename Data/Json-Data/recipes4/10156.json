                "reviewBody": "A respectable jumping-off point - a good premise, but needs work. Here's what to do to improve it: If you are aiming at a fresh taste more reminiscent of the original, then throw out the garlic powder (To save time, mash/mince a whole head when you have time, stir a Tb or two of olive oil into them, and store in a small jar in the fridge. 1 clove=about 1/2 tsp) After browning the chicken pieces, put them on a plate while you saute 1-2 cloves (depending on size) of mashed garlic. Return the chicken to the skillet and proceed as written. Be sure to add about 1/8 tsp thyme, which is authentic in the native French dish. Also, adding about 1 Tb tomato paste along with the wine and stock will 1) tone down the purple color imparted by the wine, making the sauce a more appetizing chestnut color, and 2) round out the flavor of the sauce. BTW, may be done with boneless breasts, but don't cook the chicken in the sauce the entire time, as if you cook pre-sauteed boneless breasts in liquid for 30 minutes, they will be dry and tasteless from overcooking. After you saute them, put aside and simply add them to the sauce the last 5-10 minutes of simmering. The meat will be juicy and incomparably flavorful. These changes will result in not only an easy version of the classic dish closer to the original, but also a better flavor with greater eye appeal. Real coq au vin features  a pearl onion garnish and mushrooms, either of which can be easily added at the end to this recipe if you like them.",

The intensity you might crave can come from the reduction of the cooking liquids into a demiglase. Reduce that and you have a beautiful sauce to serve over the coq au vin.",
