I didn't have jalepenos, so I substituted a half cup of salsa and I used a can of tomatoes with green chiles because I didn't have Italian style (and the chiles seemed more in keeping with the dish. In future, I will add onion,and more salsa and I'll cut back on the cream cheese (due to calories). Also, some cilantro would increase the Mexican yumminess. This was very tasty and might even be fun as a chip dip. The family enjoyed it very much and we will have it again.",
