Some suggestions: Trim the fat from the chicken otherwise the sauce gets a little oily. When returning the mixture to a boil do not cover the saucepan - allow the sauce to evaporate until it is reduced to about half its original volume. The sauce will have a glaze-like consistency. I don't have a grill so I quick-pan-fried the chicken in a little oil and minced garlic - just enough to make the outside crisp. Tasty!",
