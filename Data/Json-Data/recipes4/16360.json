Reserve all the broth from the pork - you are going to need one cup for the masa and at least one cup for your chili sauce (I used 2 cups broth instead of 1 cup broth 1 cup water) When steaming I stand them on end folded side down you want to gently steam them and keep an eye on the water level so your pan doesn't run out of water. Tamales freeze well and I have a few set aside for New Years morning. Thanks for a truly authentic recipe.",
