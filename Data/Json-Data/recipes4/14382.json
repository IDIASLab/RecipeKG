I have found a solution to the thin sauce (which always baffled me too) -- let the entire dish sit for ten minutes or so (in the baking dish and at least partially covered) before serving and the sauce should thicken up. The sauce may separate so be sure to stir it as the directions indicate before serving. The chicken will still be hot if you leave it in the baking pan. If you have leftovers you will notice that the sauce has thickened considerably. I hope this helps and that you continue to enjoy this meal! Kathy",
