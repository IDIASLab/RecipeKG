My family is a bunch of wussies so I had to tone this way down, for myself and my friends I will actually add chopped jalapeno's and/or hot salsa.  Also, if its too thin you can add a bit more cheese since I estimated the amounts.  Also, make sure its not too hot because that will make it runny (will thicken as it cools a bit) and I usually keep it in slow cooker to keep it warm and to keep it from hardening.  I almost never follow this recipe to the \"T\" and I'm always playing around with it, so I encourage you to do the same.  Enjoy! ~Jeff",
