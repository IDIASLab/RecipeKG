This would be wonderful recipe to follow if one bought one of the flavored rotisserie chickens such as Italian or garlic rotisserie...I can see where boiling the skins and bones of those type of rotisseries would add wonderful new flavors.",

And I don't bother sauteeing the carrots and onions before adding the strained broth back into the pot.  (I usually add celery and parsnips as well.)  A rotisserie chicken carcass is such a flavorful way to make this broth!  I get three meals out of one chicken -- traditional chicken dinner, use some of the chicken in stir fry, and then make the soup.  After making this base, I loosely follow the \"Classic Chicken and Rice Soup\" recipe on allrecipes.",
