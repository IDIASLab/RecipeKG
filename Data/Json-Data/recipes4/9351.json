Give them a pudding snack and they'll be just as happy...this is for the Mommas and the Daddies. I've made this many times with different variations on the same theme and was only disappointed once...when the dogs got into it first.:( I've added walnuts used Chocolate Wafer Cookies instead of ladyfingers used a spring form pan...which give it an 'ooohh lala' appearance made two layers to give it a more interesting texture (something you can sink your teeth into) and topped it with fresh whip cream and fruit or chocolate shavings. And semi-sweet chocolate chips work great...and easy to find. My favorite is all of them together. I am not a lover of cooking but this is one of my guilty pleasures. This is as good as anything you can get in a restaurant!!",
