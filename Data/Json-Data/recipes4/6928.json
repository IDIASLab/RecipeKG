It calls for \u00bd lb. of ground beef I increased it to 1 lb. and still felt that it was skimpy.   The recipe calls for \u00bd cup dry parsley this is way to much I used 1 tbsp. think next time will double this.   I have never seen a 45 oz. jar of spaghetti sauce so I used a 28 oz. jar of spaghetti sauce and a 28 oz. jar to tomato sauce the extra worked great as I used 15 oz. of fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Now for the instructions.  There is no indication on what to do with the onions for I fried them up along with mushroom the beef and spices.  Now for the layers as written there is no way that you can use \u00bd the amount of meat sauce in the layers and still have some for the top.  The way it should read is as the following:  small amount of sauce on the bottom of the pan, noodles, 1/3 of meat sauce, \u00bd of the cheese mixture, noodles, 1/3 of meat sauce, remaining cheese mixture, noodles and remaining of the meat mixture.   Bake as pre the recipe instructions.  I will be making this again.",

I just followed the general outline of the recipe so I used all the ingredients that were called for but in terms of quantity I kind of just eyeballed everything and added in the amount as I though appropriate. I also accidentally bought cottage cheese instead of ricotta cheese. It was too late by the time I realized that and so I went ahead and used it. It turned out very well and it got my daughter's approval so hence the 4 star rating. In my opinion a much better recipe than the slow cooker lasagna.",

It made it difficult to layer the lasagna & also ended up being a bit sweet. So next time we'll use a spicy marinara instead. We prepped the night before and made the next day thinking it would take a lot of time. But it was surprisingly a lot faster than our first attempt at a different lasagna. Great recipe! We will be making it again!:)",

My changes were to use fresh spinach (2 10oz. pkg) which I added to the almost cooked onion and garlic with spices. I cooked the meat with the salt and pepper but did not add it to the marinara. I did it all in layers. Cheese mix spinach mix meat and then the sauce. I'm sure you get the gist. In all there were 4 layers of noodles the bottom one on top of the marinara the 4 filling layers I mentioned earlier. (You should actually divide the filling ingredients in half.) noodles fillings noodles and the top layer as originally written. The timing was pretty good. Just increased the unfoiled portion of timing to 25 minutes instead of 15. Awesome!",

I also used a pound of ground beef as I thought a half pound was not enough. I will revise my review after I taste it. But next time I will add my onions while browning the beef which I will also increase. I had a pound and a half but figured there was a good reason for only using a half pound. As my family are meat lovers I will follow my instincts next time I prepare depending on the taste. However it was quite tasty... even without the onions.",

I used fresh spinach fresh cilantro instead of dried parsley dividing it between the meat sauce and the ricotta filling and fresh homemade spinach lasagna noodles. I used a whole onion 3 cups of ricotta and a pound of extra lean ground beef as my husband likes a meaty cheesy sauce. Because of using the fresh pasta it took less time than the recipe indicates to cook and was done in 55 minutes. It was nice and cheesy. Will be making again.",
