I didn't use the meat tenderizer and had to use a substitution for the self-rising flour (1 cup of flour 1 and 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder and a pinch of salt). I ended up cooking the chicken for 45 minutes and even with the changes the chicken came out perfectly! The only thing I may change in the future is decreasing the amount of salt in this dish as I felt the chicken was overly salty (especially with the chips). I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for the great recipe!",
