To make it easier, a bit healthier, and a bit tangy, I used frozen O'Brien potatoes, 10 oz. real bacon bits, 1 cup lite mayonnaise, 1 cup of nonfat plain yogurt, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, crushed black pepper, and freshly crushed marjoram.  After baking the casserole, I sprinkled more shredded cheddar on top and broiled it to golden brown...delicious!!!",
