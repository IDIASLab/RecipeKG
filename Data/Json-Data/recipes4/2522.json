For the beets I like to roast them (as you would a potato-1 hour @ 450, wrapped whole in foil) then cubed marinated overnight in vinegar (balsalmic or red wine).  I also sub feta for the goat cheese.  9/15/2007:Whenever I go to Cheesecake Factory this is the salad I order.  Thank you so much for this recipe (its going to save me so much $ to make it at home).  The only changes I would make is to substitute pecans for the walnuts and add some roasted asparagus spears.  ",
