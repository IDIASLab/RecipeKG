Due to time conflicts I marinated the meat overnight and the next morning put the marinade and the chicken breast in the crockpot. They cooked all day and I then took 2 forks and shredded the meat. We had this for dinner as fajita's with grilled peppers onions lettuce and tomatoes. Also served as a fajita salad using the same ingredients plus salsa as the dressing. The lime flavor was very prominent with this method but we really enjoyed the taste of the chicken. I am going to make and freeze burritos with the leftovers. Thank you Lauren for sharing your recipe. I think RG made a great selection for Cinco De Mayo.",

I made it as directed and it was not really what I was hoping for. The lime dominated the other flavors to the point that I could barely detect there was anything else in the marinade besides the citrus. Normally I squeeze 1/2 a lime over my chicken fajitas prior to serving and I enjoy the brightness that gives. Overnight in lime juice is much too long also as it changed the texture of the chicken and made it sort of grainy when cooked. Probably won't make this again.",

I then drained off the liquid and cooked it in a pan on the stove until it was done. It had great flavor just a bit too lime-y for me (hubby liked it as it was). I served this on warmed flour tortillas w/ shredded cheddar tomatoes sour cream and salsa. Very nice dinner! I would def make this again (just reduce the lime juice)! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I followed the marinating instructions and ingredients except I accidentally put in a teaspoon of cumin and chili powder instead of 1/2 tsp but that turned out to be a good thing because I think it benefited with the extra spice. The chicken was very tender but a bit strong on the lime flavor for us. I'd try it again but will cut down the amount of lime and add a bit more spices (we are just spice lovers here). We enjoyed the fajitas and felt it was a nice healthy meal. We topped with stir fried bell peppers onions jalape\u00f1os fresh avocado slices and cheddar cheese.

I had smallish breast pieces thin like cutlets so it only took 1/2 cup lime juice and one Tbl oil to cover them with the marinade. I used the full amount of spices but I feel like once the meat's \"surrounded\" any additional liquid is just wasted. I marinated the full 8 hours turning the bag a couple of times and then grilled them which didn't really lend to shredding so I sliced it for tacos. The lime flavor is pretty strong but we like lime and chicken is so boring. I don't think I would prefer this just as a piece of chicken but in the tacos or on a salad the lime really adds to the dish in my opinion. I made this for recipe group good pick.",
