I used 4 chicken breast halves rather than 3 and I cut the chicken up into bite size chunks rather than leaving whole. I used milk rather than 1 1/4 cups water to make it a little more creamy. The only things I might change the next time I make this is to add a layer of stuffing on the bottom and a sprinkle of cheese on top. May also add a little more broccoli and sour cream. I thought this was a pretty good recipe...Thanks!",
