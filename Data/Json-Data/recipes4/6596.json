At the end where I was supposed to add the wine and soup, I missed that part entirely. That being said, the meat was very tasty and served over rice it was good. But it was dry. Without the soup and wine, it left a lot to be desired. So I will try this again because the meat had good flavor, but this time I will pay more attention and add all the ingredients.",
