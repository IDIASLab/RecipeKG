Stacy, I have to tell you, I didn't change anything with this recipe and these are some of the BEST Brussel sprouts I've ever made, bar none!!! I wanted something different, remembered the sprouts and made them to your specs and had them with some BBQ'd ribs.  Cut them in half, boiled them for almost 5 minutes which left them with just the right amount of crunch.  The combination of butter, honey mustard dill and onion is delightful.  Please know that your recipe has been saved and shared already with my daughter and 2 neighbors.  I can't wait to do this one again.  TY!!",

Instead of boiling (i dont care for boiled veggies) I cooked the Brussels sprouts in a couple tablespoons of olive oil a hot skillet for around 6 minutes.  I prepared the sauce using 3 parts honey to 2 parts mustard and I used half yellow mustard and half brown.  I don't think that any of my changes strayed from the original intent of the author.  The mustard is a perfect combined with these little cabbage veggies (think corned beef & cabbage with mustard).  I will make these again.  Thanks sueb for recommending.

They were cooked and ready to serve when I made a last minute search on this site to try to make them tastier. I was in such a hurry that I just plopped on some soft butter, squeezed on some honey, sprinkled on some onion powder and dill weed, and mixed it all together. I left out the mustard, but what a transformation! Everyone scarfed them down and asked for more! Very yummy.",
