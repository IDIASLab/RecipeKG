From the ingredients I was pretty confident it would be a hit, so I doubled it the first time out and baked in a 13x9 glass dish lined with foil as recipe recommends. I baked at 350 for 30 min, then another 10 for the peanut butter topping. Perfect! The changes I made were to use multi grain oatmeal type cereal, not the quick oats; natural peanut butter, no salt, agave nectar instead of sugar, and I used a blend of hemp hearts, milled flax seeds, and chia seeds instead of flax and wheat germ. I just cut them up and put in plastic bags in the fridge so they're easy to grab and go.  One Note: don't be afraid of the peanut butter topping--it just cooks into the bars and isn't messy at all.",

The banana & honey give it a slight sweetness, and my only cheat was to use Skippy dark chocolate peanut butter.  As suggested, I used a combination of bananas and applesauce, more flax seeds, and even used freshly ground peanut butter from Sprouts for the top layer.  Compared to a store-bought protein bar, I admit that I like that the store bought is covered in a layer of chocolate (which I should be avoiding anyway).  Besides from that, this is SO MUCH cheaper and it feels good to be eating a home-made bar without the commercial additives.  I needed something to help me achieve a healthy, active lifestyle without costing a lot of money.  Now these have replaced store-bought protein bars as my pre or post-workout snack!  It is powerful fuel, satisfying, and easy to make!",
