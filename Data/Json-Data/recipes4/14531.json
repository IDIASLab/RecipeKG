                "reviewBody": "This is a hard recipe for me to review. I love to say only positive things but honestly I have issues with the terminology and quantities of certain ingredients. Recipe directions said to make a marinade of the yogurt vinegar and spices. Then soak at least one hour or overnight. This was more of a coating rather than a marinade. My VERY limited exposure to cooking sent me to the dictionary after preparing this dish to research the meaning of marinate as it pertains to cooking. Marinate is soaking or exposing a food item for a long period time then removing. The yogurt mixture is UNremovable so I m choosing to call it a Yogurt Coating. Also it was so salty and hot we could hardly eat it. Way beneath the salt and the heat was a hint of what I think might be a great dish. Could the 2 tablespoons of salt be a typo? If you were truly MARINATING the meat those quantities would be o.k. Not being able to remove the meat from the coating is in my opinion the downfall of this dish. When I make this again and I will with a good tweaking I ll use maybe 1 or 2 teaspoons of salt 1 teaspoon each of black pepper and cayenne or ancho chili pepper powder. The garlic and ginger paste is a combination I love so I think there might be some hope for this Vindaloo!",
