Veal cooks quickly - do NOT overcook, the most important criteria, in my opinion, for Veal  Marsala, or any veal dish for that matter.  Set veal aside on a platter and keep warm.  Add a little more butter and olive oil to pan and saut\u00e9 mushrooms, some shallots if you like, and minced garlic for 4-5 minutes, not ten!  Add  about a cup each of chicken broth and  REAL Marsala (NEVER cooking wine as directed, and certainly no water!) and cook until it is reduced  by about two-thirds.  Swirl in a dab of butter at the end, off heat, for a velvety rich, luxurious, glossy sauce.  Return the veal to the pan just for a minute or so to ensure everything is  heated through.  An easy to make and impressive, classic dish, but as written this recipe needs some work.   A dish is only as good as the ingredients you use and if it is cooked properly.",

                "reviewBody": "I used this as a base recipe for my own version. I baked the chicken in the oven for 30 minutes and broiled on middle rack for 10 more minutes. I coated the chicken with olive oil and sea salt before baking. I used some chicken thighs and some boneless breasts. I think the thighs are tastier. For the sauce I used chicken broth and Marsala Wine. I kept tasting it because initially I used mostly Wine which is way too strong a taste. I kept adding chicken broth till the wine taste became flavorful instead of overpowering. I would say the ratio was at least 60-70% broth to 40-30% wine. I also included butter parsley Rosemary and sliced mushrooms. I thickened the mixture with cornstarch because we have gluten sensitive people in the family. I know this is an in-exact recipe but the sauce did come out good and I would make it again.",
