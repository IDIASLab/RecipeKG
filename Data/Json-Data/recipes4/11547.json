Didn't have any cream and it wasn't missed. Rave reviews from Dad and 2 kids.  Yummy.",

I also added garlic green pepper curry powder and doubled the soy. I threw in some frozen peas and a chopped fresh tomato as well. After a taste test I liberally salted and peppered and added more curry. It was a tad bland before tweaking and I still felt it needed something. Next time I will add a bit of peanut butter. It was sufficiently spicy and the noodles sopped up the sauce nicely. I used lite coconut milk and found the consistency to be perfect. ALMOST restaurant quality in my estimation.",
