I went with the semi -raw eggs not the greatest. Might try milder onions next time. Nevertheless a great breakfast and I'll definitely do it again. I also added hot sauce coz I love the stuff??.",

Like the other reviewer I cooked the onion and pepper first. I only used three eggs because I didn't have the full amount of rice. I probably added more soy sauce than the recipe called for but overall it was very good and I will make again. My husband really enjoyed it.",

Just have the oven on warm for each (I put each on a paper plate in the oven til I assembled the dish).  The only thing I did differently, was mixing 2 TBS soy with 2 TBS bacon fat and drizzled this over the \"bowl\" ...... kind of like a Poke Bowl, the rice needs this, yet it doesn't really soak in if the rice is a day old, if it's fresh it will soak right in, that's why it's best to cook the rice the day (or night) before.   \nI added 3 crispy slices of bacon in the bowl off to the side.  I added a couple of slices of avocado to our, it was almost overkill but delicious none the less!",
