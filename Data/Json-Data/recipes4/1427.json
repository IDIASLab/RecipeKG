Add a pinch of salt while cooking the onions to help them soften and get sweeter.  There is no need to use expensive tenderloin for this.  Pork loin stands up better to long slow cooking.  To reduce the heat, remove seeds and white membranes from the Jalapeno peppers.  The tomato paste should be sauteed until it darkens and caramelizes before adding the beef broth.  That removes the harsh acidic taste and adds a mellow sweetness.",
