I didn't grill it because chorizo has so much flavor I didn't want to loose it and you will with grilling, so I steamed/water boiled it in a pan. When I pulled the sausage out of the pan I kept all the grease in there and sauteed the onions, bell pepper and mushrooms in the grease.. I didn't use the extra 1 tablespoon butter. It was great! :) My husband really loved it too.",

I sauteed the mushrooms in about one cup dry white wine and then added the already partially sauteed onions and peppers. I also added the garlic at this time. After the mushrooms were soft, I added the butter, parmesan, cream and Chorizo. To this I added a drained 12 ounce can of black beans. I tasted it and it brought tears to my eyes.

I use bulk chorizo to spread it further than chunked links. And this recipe is so forgiving! I used an extra 1/2 box penne tonight so I added an extra 1/2 of the sauce recipe. Didn't have enough butter this time but 1 cup was plenty. You can cook the sauce a little a lot have the veggies crunchy soft more butter less butter etc. and it still turns out wonderfully! Like I said forgiving recipe! One of our faves and definitely worth a try if you're looking for something new.",
