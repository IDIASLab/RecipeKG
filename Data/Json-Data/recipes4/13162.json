In place of the reduced baking powder add this.  I TSP of lemon juice (fresh is best) & 1 TSP of honey.  (honey)  not sugar. honey will sustain higher heat than sugar without burning.  If you decide the batter is too thick, cut it with water.  Milk will make it tougher/chewier.  I am out of the business now, but happy to help out others.   kpare55@telus.net",

Incorrectly using Baking Soda (also known as Bi-carb Soda or Sodium bi-carbonate) in this recipe will give the \"tangy\" or bitter taste other reviewers have mentioned. Baking Soda is not a \"one for one\" substitute for Baking Powder - which usually contains about 25% baking soda (alkali) + 50% cream of tartar (acid) and a buffer ingredient. The acid/alkali combination aerates the mixture when liquid is added. Hope this helps",
