(I think it should be 3 T Chili Powder & 1 T Cumin) Besides that I think that this recipe needs onions -the bell pepper didn't seem to fit quite right especially without the onion. I hope the submitter steps in and if the recipe is incorrect asks AR to correct it. In the meantime - beware and make the corrections yourself. UPDATE - there is no way you will need 4 cups of water unless you plan to cook this down all day or want Chili Soup.",
