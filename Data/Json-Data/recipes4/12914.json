Had only my own canned tomatoes so used 1 qt. w/ juice. After 1 can of beer and the JD I skipped the water as it seemed very liquidy. Also since I cooked everything in a dutch oven I put it in the oven at 425 for 1 1/2 hrs. This cooked the liquid down nicely.There was a special \"twang\" that stood out. Maybe the JD? Whatever it was it made this recipe special. Will make this again!",

I used venison sausage which was the ground meat with seasoning. Made it with a different type of pepper than the jalepeno and learned a big no-no. Cutting a pepper with bare hands is bad. Because even hours later many hand washes & soaking my fingers in buttermilk didn't get rid of the sting. Then taking out your contacts later is even more painful. I can laugh now but it hurt at the time.",
