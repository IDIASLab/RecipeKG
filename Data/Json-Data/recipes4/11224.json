I just started Phase 2 of the South Beach diet and was actually looking for an easy whole wheat pizza dough recipe and happened upon this one which works great! Before adding the oil and water I mixed some garlic powder Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese in with the WW flour and salt. I rolled them about 6\" in diameter and 1/8\" thick and cooked them in a pan according to the instructions. I then topped one with a little pizza sauce (sugar free) veggies and mozzarella (reduced fat). Popped it in the toaster oven for a quick treat--a perfect guilt-free reward for graduating to the next phase of the diet plan! Thanks for the recipe. I'm sure it will become a staple in my kitchen!",
