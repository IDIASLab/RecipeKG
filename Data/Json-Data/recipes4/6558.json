As a disclaimer, I made a couple of changes because I didn't want to make a trip to the grocery store. I used a can of cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and a combination of shredded cheddar and swiss cheeses. I also used whole wheat linguine for the pasta. As several others had suggested, I reduced the amount of milk to 13/4 cups, and I found that amount to be perfect for the amount of chicken and pasta. My husband really enjoyed it and I will add the recipe to my growing list of AR favorites.\nI think the next time I'll add some frozen peas and a small can of mushrooms. I also think the recipe would work with chopped ham or turkey.",

I had fresh portabella mushrooms so I added almost a whole 10oz. package of those but left out the celery. I also added 1 large clove of garlic. I used canola oil to cook the veggies instead of butter. The milk seemed like too much so I cut that in half. I didn't have enough cheddar cheese so I substituted with Swiss for half of the cheese and sprinkled some parmesan on top before I baked it. My only disappointment was that it had too much pepper but that may have been my own mistake when I cut the recipe down. I would make it again but leave out the pepper.",
