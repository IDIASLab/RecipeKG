It was SO flavorful. This will be so perfect for when family is visiting. Thank you!!",

I didn't have white shredded cheddar for I subbed white American slices. I used a pound if bulk breakfast sausage that I used the day before for Breakfast Burritos. Topped with the cheese slices. I used a couple extra eggs in the mix. I have to admit I wanted to finish off the carton of milk so I swapped milk and water. I reserved about 1 cup of the batter mix and after I placed the bread squares on top I poured the last of the egg batter on top. Sealed it off and put it in the fridge for the next morning!
