Save yourself some trouble and toss the wedges in oil, put on the sheet and season by hand as you do the bread crumbs or panko.  That will result in the best evenly seasoned wedges.  Mine turned out spotty and where seasoning was heaviest, it burned. \n\nI will say, the wedges did turn out crisp for me and unlike so many others mentioned, I did not find them to be overly salty or seasoned at all.  All personal taste I suppose.",
