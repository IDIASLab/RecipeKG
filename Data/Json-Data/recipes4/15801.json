Two cups of water wasn\u2019t enough to even cover the chicken breasts, so more water and a little more soup base went into the pot initially.  I shredded the chicken and put it into the pot along with the veggies and the rice.  Once I mixed in the rice, I knew it needed even more liquid, since rice cooks at a 1 part rice to 2 parts liquid ratio, so I added some chicken broth.  After simmering for 30 minutes, neither the rice nor the carrots were cooked, so back on for another 15 minutes.  When I next checked, the rice had absorbed most of the additional chicken broth.  I know she says this is a very thick soup, but at that point, it was on the verge of totally drying out, so I added even more chicken broth to reach a soup consistency (and it was still \u201cthick\u201d).   The instructions aren't good, but it does taste good, so if you're prepared to tweak, go for it!",

I had no problem adding the tarragon as I love it with chicken, but basil? I just wasn't so sure. Well, the combination of them both was INCREDIBLE to say the least! The only change I made was to make my own chicken stock and to use the meat from a whole chicken. I will never make another pot of chicken soup any other way.

I also added a bit more water- 5 total cups and pre-cooked rice- as I found that it wasn't soupy enough for our tastes.

                "reviewBody": "The tarragon is a great flavor for this soup! I make a similar soup but use a lot more broth to rice. The ratio of broth to rice that I use is probably more like 3-4 quarts broth to 1 cup of rice (but I use brown rice in a slow cooker which might make a difference?). Actually I typically only make this when I have a roasted chicken. After the bones are picked relatively clean I place the leftover meat in the fridge only adding it to the soup at the end just to warm through. I the meantime I place the bones in a 4-5 qt. slow cooker overnight with plenty of water salt and vinegar as well as onion peel scraps and similar veggie scraps if I have them on hand. --- In the a.m. I pull out the bones strain the broth if needed put in some fresh onions (chopped) and garlic (maybe whole cloves) possibly carrots and the seasonings plus the rice. Shortly before serving I place the chicken meat in and possibly (but not often) some frozen peas. The result is amazing comfort food. SO IMHO RubyJewel did a great job on everything except the amount of broth........ but then I don't use white rice and don't do a quick stove-top cooking of the rice.... which might make a good bit of difference.",
