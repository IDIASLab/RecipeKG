Being on a diet and always looking for recipes using ground turkey because there's only so much ground turkey a person can eat. I had only jarred jalapeno's so used those instead and didn't have tomatillo salsa either so I improvised with a can of Ortega chopped green chili's and some whole tomatillo's from a can that I chopped.
