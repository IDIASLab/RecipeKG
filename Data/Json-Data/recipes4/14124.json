Many people and restraunt owners would come and flock around the business to make advanced orders, since it ran out so quickly!! My Uncle had a similar recipe but used basically all the same ingredients listed here but also used cinnamon sticks, dried chile pods, chile tepin and grounded all this ingredients in a blender till they became powdery then added the vinegar, water and olive oil. He also used half ground pork and half ground beef. It was the best Chorizo in the world. I use that same recipe handed down from generations to this day and have handed it down to my daughter and my granddaughters.",

My little guy loved it so much that I had to cook up some more for him to eat lol. I just divided it into approx. 1/2# portions and froze it that way so I'll have it ready for any recipe that calls for it. I loved that this was not at all greasy like the traditional chorizo but had all the flavor. Definitely will be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
