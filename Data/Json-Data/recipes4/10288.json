My mom and husband are veteran broccoli rice casserole lovers and thought this dish was exactly like it should be.  It is a bland dish but that's what broccoli rice casseroles are.  The only alteration I made was using milk instead of water and it turned out exactly as it should have.  I, too, thought it was a bit runny before baking but Mom said, \"it will bake fine,\" and it did.  Personally, I like a more flavorful dish so next time, I will add seasoned salt and maybe some garlic.  More traditional broccoli rice casserole lovers will want this recipe as is, though!\r\n\r\nMama",

I found it easy to prepare and only used two large pots for the preparation and I even doubled the recipe as I was making it for a church function. For those not cooking for a crowd or the starting line up of a professional football team, you will probably want to cut this recipe  in half.\n\nI did find the directions  to be a little vague. It should have specified that the rice measurement listed was uncooked and will yield 6 cups when prepared. Also the recipe calls for a \"bunch\" of celery, it should be one stalk, if an entire bunch were used the casserole would be inedible.\n\nThe only real change I made was to top the dish with shredded cheddar. I live  in the South and a casserole isn't a casserole without a crumb or cheese topping. \n\nThis is a recipe that I will definitely make again.",

So I added fresh minced garlic seasoning salt & paprika. I used 1 can of Campbell's Cream of Chicken & Mushroom (I wasn't even aware that it existed until today! lol) & 1 can of Campbell's Broccoli & Cheese Soup (Next time I'm going to try Cream of Broccoli in place of). In place of the water I used milk. I omitted the celery. And I used 2 pkgs. of 16 oz. frozen broccoli. I sauteed the onion in the butter & in the same pan (on low heat setting after the onion was cooked); Then added the soups milk & seasonings & mixed all together next the cubed velveta stirring until it was all melted I added the dry uncooked rice & broccoli (I heated in the microwave for about 10 min. to soften). Made sure it was all mixed together the put it in the bakind pan (COVERED) for 45 min. Uncovered it & baked additional 10-15 min. My husband loved it! I know a lot of people are against changing the recipe & reviewing it. But I think reviews have a lot to do with sharing tips shortcuts & tweaks to help other cooks & ultimately make the dish even better. What I really like about this recipe is there is a lot of different ways to put this together & you can tweak it & make it your own easily!",
