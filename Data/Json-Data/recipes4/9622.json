It was actually better the next day. I began by frying some chopped bacon and sauteing the onion in the bacon grease because I've never seen a recipe for clam chowder without bacon or salt pork. Then I followed the recipe as printed sprinkling the bacon bits on the top of each bowl. I actually liked the idea of thickening with crackers instead of a flour/butter roux though this may account for the starchy flavor versus the more appealing clam flavor. I'll use this again though perhaps using bottled clam juice in place of the water. Thanks for posting.",
