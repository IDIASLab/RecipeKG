This soup is so good, there's no reason to wait until Passover to enjoy it.",

Also my turnips were (sadly) not good enough to use so I subbed some (red) potatoes. I do love turnips though so the next time they're going in! I also added some white beans because I had 'em and thought it would help in the place of the missing chicken. We were going through a cold snap when I made this and it was a lovely dish for a not-so-lovely day outside. I love how you can customize the vegetables you use also. Thanks!",

We added fresh cilantro (what we had on hand) and dried rosemary which did not conflict with each other. We used dried dill which was fine and most importantly added a scoop of bouillon paste which adds ALOT of flavor. I add this paste to all my soups. As this soup cooked and we tasted the broth in stages we could taste depth as everything came together. My husband is not a big soup guy but he really loved this. I would say spring for a nice organic chicken as it makes a difference and this makes a nice big batch.",
