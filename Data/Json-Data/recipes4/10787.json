I took the suggestion of others and only used 1 cup of water, and it made plenty of gravy (which tasted great on my garlic mashed potatoes).  I also simmered it for about 30 minutes, which made the chicken very tender.  This will definitely be a keeper in my kitchen.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

I used about 21/2 lbs of boneless chicken breast and since they were thick I cut them in half length wise and sprinkled each piece with the onion powder and seasoned salt instead of tsp measure also used 14 oz can of stewed tomatoes istead of fresh plum tomatoes. I didn't increase any of the other ingredents. Made 1 lb of bow tie noodles and poured chicken mixture over noodles. I will most definitely save this to my recipe box to make again.",

I was scared of the salt even though I love salt and used low salt soy sauce and just seasoned the chicken with onion powder and black pepper. I too used a can of diced tomatoes. We ate it over rice.
