For instance Indian chicken is almost always prepared skinless but that's not clear in the recipe and I wonder if the nutritional info reflected skin-on chicken. Also I wonder if the chili powder really is chili powder... I suspect it's supposed to be ground chilis or cayenne powder instead. Chili powder is for making regular western chili. At any rate I used only 1 tablespoon of cayenne pepper (not chili powder) and used 2 pounds of boneless skinless chicken breast for health reasons. I reduced the oil to 2 tablespoons reduced the salt to a 1/2 teaspoon and replaced the coconut milk with light coconut milk plus a dash of coconut extract. Despite the modifications the dish was still outstanding. Perfect for scooping up with Indian breads or you could leave a bit of the sauce and have it over basmati rice. The recipe did call for a lot of water--I think 1/2 to 1 cup is better depending on how wide your pan is. The amount of cayenne I used resulted in a moderately hot dish.",

Having never cooked this kind of dish before I didn't know what to expect but it was very easy and very delicious. The only thing that marred the event was that I couldn't get the liquid to boil off. I covered the dish for the allotted time and when I took it off all the liquid was still there. I went ahead and added the coconut milk and let it boil down there but used the thick sauce over rice instead. It was still delicious but likely not what was intended. I will try to get it correct next time as I will definitely be making this again.",

It does take a while to let all the gravy cook away and quite a bit of stirring toward the end to avoid burning it. We like to add a small bag of mixed veggies to soak up more flavor and make it a one dish meal with basmati rice. We also like to serve it with yogurt and Indian Relish from this site. If we could give this 10 stars out of 5 we would.",
