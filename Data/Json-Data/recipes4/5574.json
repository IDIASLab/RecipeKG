We used a low sodium soy sauce which was fine as their is more than enough salt in the recipe. We cooked a 4 lb butt in the slow cooker for about 8 hours steaming with the cabbage for the last 30 minutes. The result was great. I served it with Guam styled fried rice so it was a real gut buster feast. While buns or rolls are somewhat traditional as a low glutein household we don't feel they are required. in fact the first time I served this with hot dog buns the bread was ignored entirely as everyone was perfectly full with pork cabbage rice and vegetables. while not anyone's idea of a health nut dinner this is certainly a good option if you want a breadless meal.",

I chose this recipe over others because it called for ginger worcestershire and some soy sauce vs. just salt and liquid smoke which I feel flavored the roast much better. I also used medium grain Hawaiian Alaea Sea Salt. If you do use a granule salt like I did whether it be Kosher or Hawaiian assure that you first crush it with a mortar and pestle and cut the salt back if you don't like your meat very salty. I also served the pork over a bed of the steamed cabbage leaves just as it was served to us at \"Feast at Lele\" Luau in Maui last month. I would recommend this for two reasons. First this is a lot of pork and since there were lots of left over s I wanted my cabbage steamed fresh when eating it again not soggy as it would be when you reheat it with the cabbage mixed in. Second I also added Mexican spices (Chili powder cumin garlic powder onion powder cayenne pepper. etc..) and made some delicious shredded pork tacos for lunch one day. I will be making this recipe again many times in the future.",

You could taste the ginger (athough I still think it needs a touch more than what's called for,) and the 1-1/2 tbsp of salt was perfect after I shredded the meat. I served it as mini-sliders on Hawaiian rolls, with a touch of hickory smoke BBQ sauce, the cabbage, and a slice of swiss cheese... Delicious Hawaiian goodness!  Amazing after cooling down and sitting in the fridge for a few hours.  Can you tell I loved this?? :) **EDIT**\n\nHaving lived in Memphis, Tn for the last 30 years and eating pork shoulder at seemingly almost every gathering, work luncheon, etc., I was excited about making this and was hoping for more of a Hawaiian flare, but that was not the case.  You can't really taste the ginger at all but you can definitely taste the salt which I cut down to 1 and 1/2 tablespoons .  The salt should probably be cut down to 1 tablespoon and the amount of ginger should be increased.  The roast did cook beautifully in the crock pot (and once I shredded it the salty taste subsided quite a bit.)  The best part of the dish for me was the cabbage which I shredded and just threw on top of the roast for the last hour of cooking.  The cabbage soaked up the flavor of the roast quite well.  I spooned it out before shredding the roast and saved it in a separate container to stay crisp.  Thanks for the post.",
