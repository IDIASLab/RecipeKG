Smitten Kitchen has a recipe for the dough published that adds egg to the dough that really knocks these out of the park. \"regular\" pie crusts are awesome in a pinch but I think you'll be surprised if you try it. Instead of jam which is rather loose for this sort of thing, go for fruit concentrates or heat and thicken the jam with a bit of corn starch. Nut butters make another really great filler for these and avoid all the unnecessary sugar from the frosting. A light dusting of sugar gets the job done.",
