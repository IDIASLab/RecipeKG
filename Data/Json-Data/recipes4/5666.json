Besides that I stuck to the recipe, and it turned out good for a simple weekday family meal, but probably not for company. And you do have to be very careful that your oil doesn't get too hot, because the breading will burn very quickly while the chicken is still pink inside. I probably will make again.",

They were sooooooo tender and tasty. Thanks for the submission. It makes me very happy when my family likes what I cook. P.S. What is the green stuff in the picture?",

I also preferred to fry these in olive oil over the vegetable oil. I know it s better for you but more important to me it tastes better too. Forget about using your good extra-virgin olive oil for this pure or light is much less expensive and actually much better for frying anyway.",

It's hard to know what \"to taste\" is with the salt & pepper when it's added to the egg so after tasting a cooked piece I added more salt & pepper to the flour and crumbs because it was bland. I actually thought it was going to be over seasoned after that but it still seemed bland. So heed the advice of other reviewers and season season season - if you don't the chicken will be tasteless. I fried in avocado oil with a touch of butter added. I think this could be improved by adding some additional seasonings. I may try again with Panko and adding in some garlic or garlic butter and possibly some onion powder. I didn't go fancy and just served this with a simple garden salad. I did love that dinner was done fairly quickly with very little mess.",
