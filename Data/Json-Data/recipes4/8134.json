Instead of tilapia I used haddock schrod (because it was available) and the dish was delicious. I found no need to measure most of the ingredients. I do suggest using one chopped tomato per packet to one 1/2 lb. strip of fish. Then add an estimated amount of onion capers garlic and kalamata olives. Coat the fish with olive oil evenly before closing the packets tightly. Thanks for the great recipe that I will use when company visits and we cook outdoors.",
