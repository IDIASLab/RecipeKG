I have also used frozen peas, asparagus, and cauliflower in this recipe, so play around with it with different vegetables. I haven't had any that I didn't like with this broth. It makes a very large pot, so for a smaller family you may want to halve it. I have a family of 10 and there's usually a little bit left over. I serve it with rolls so all the food groups are covered. The cooking times are approximate and may very depending on your stove -- so pay attention to when your veggies are cooked. Stir often so you don't scorch the broth after adding the milk, cheese, and mushroom soup.",
