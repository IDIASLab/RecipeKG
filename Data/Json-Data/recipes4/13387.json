I did not make this recipe because I thought it sounded like a great recipe I thought that it would be filling and help make room for new stuff. Was I ever wrong!! This was really good. My dad who does not like soup took seconds!! Without being asked. I made this mostly how it calls for except that I sauteed cut up chicken thighs I didn't poach and shred. And I used an immersion blender to chunk up the potatoes a bit after they were mostly cooked. I did end up shredding some of the chicken in the process but it worked. Will definitely be making this again.",

I didn't have roasted red peppers so I used 1/2 c. diced green pepper and roasted it in a black iron skillet in 1 t. olive oil and 1/2 t. sugar (could use soy sauce instead of sugar if not using miso) till the edges were brown. Left out the Parmesan cheese and served over jasmine rice. Added pepper to taste in individual bowls. This is definitely going in our regular rotation! YUM!!",
