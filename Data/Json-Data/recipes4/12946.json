I didn't use the processed cheese, only the cheddar, and it seemed pretty cheesy (although next time I think I will add at least some of the processed cheese).  I don't think I would add the bacon grease the next time, to make it healthier.  I will definitely make this again, thanks for the recipe.",

We followed the directions exactly. It didn't need very much salt at all in our opinion you'll want to taste it to see if salt and pepper are needed before adding in the eggs since tasting raw eggs can potentially make you sick. It is rather runny so moving it to the oven can be a little tricky. We cooked it for 30 min and checked it it was bubbly but not golden brown. 10 more minutes and a beautiful browned cheesy crust and the grits were completely set. Great creaminess from the processed cheese and the sharpness from the cheddar and who doesn't love bacon? I sprinkled cilantro on the top and chalula sauce on my plate (after tasting so I could review fairly). My one question was why did I need to cook 8 slices of bacon to only use some of the grease and half of the cooked bacon? Perhaps I was supposed to sprinkle it on the top with the cheddar cheese. I make a bacon sandwich instead;)",
