I also used prepared mustard instead of dry mustard. Also some people did make the comment the the dipping sauce was bland well that is the making of honey dill sauce all you need to do is cut back on the mayonaise add a little more honey and add some dill and it will be delicious thats what i did. FYI if you don't have the buttery round which i didn't one time that i made this i used a combo of pretzel and corn flakes and i gave a awesome taste i have made this recipe several times already and i never seem to have the crackers. YUMMY!!!!!!!",

I made it as a main dish by using pounded out chicken breasts (halved) and increased the cooking time to about 35 minutes. I modified the recipe by adding dijon mustard (a few tablespoons) to the final dipping sauce and thinning out the mayo/mustard dredge with some olive oil and regular mustard. I would suggest making more of the sesame/cracker crumb mix because I didnt have quite enough. Great job Erica!",

To give them more nutrients we replaced finely grated carrots for the onions and used miricle whip in place of mayo. In place of buttery crackers we used regular non salt cracker crumbs mixed with 1/2 teaspoon to one table spoon of honey. Mix honey miracle whip and crackers together and coat chicken then spray shallow pan with pam or a little oil. Bake coated chicken for about 18 - to 20 minutes or until done. For dipping sauce they use honey or barbecue sauce. They loved it. Thanks for the post.",
