Quinoa is cooked like rice, 1 part quinoa 2 parts liquid) This was my whole dinner, my husband had it as a side dish to steak. This was incredible and my new favorite way to make quinoa!",

I'll make this again for sure!",

For my veggies I used garlic, bell pepper, kale, zucchini, and cauliflower. I added a little more cumin and a little garlic powder and it came out wonderful. My carnivorous boyfriend topped his with marinara sauce and said it was the best veggie meal I've made to date. Really easy, really versatile, really delicious.
