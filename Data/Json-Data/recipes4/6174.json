                "reviewBody": "Let me start by saying that the rice was very, very flavorful. It's an easy to follow recipe but I did do a couple of things differently. First of all, I used 8 chops but only doubled the recipe ingredients. Which might explain why the chops were a little bland. Well either that or I didn't salt and pepper enough (no clear measurements to go by). After browning the chops, instead of putting them on a paper towel, I put them on a plate and covered with foil. This way I could add the juices that settled at the bottom of the plate to the rice when I put in the chops. I used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown rice and I gave a large onion a rough chop and sliced four large pieces of garlic, instead of dicing and mincing them. I added 1 cup of broth to scrape the pan then added the rest of the broth to the rice. Because I doubled the ingredients, I used 2 tsp of cayenne (even though I read a lot of other reviews saying that even 1 tsp seemed to be too much). By the end of the final 20 minute cooking time, the rice tasted fiery hot and wasn't even close to being done. So, I added 1 more cup of broth (5 altogether) and let the dish cook for another 20 minutes. Some of the pieces of rice were still stiff and the chops were somewhat dry but the extra cup of broth toned down the fire a bit. Because the chops were a bit bland/dry and the rice was stiff after 40 minutes, I can only give this 3 stars. But I would still give this another try.",
