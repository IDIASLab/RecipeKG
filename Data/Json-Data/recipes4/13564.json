(Am I the only one who didn't know this?) Instead of canned black beans I decided to cook dry white beans from scratch because I had them. I undercooked them -- boiled them for five minutes, then let them sit in the hot water for about two hours. I knew they were undercooked because they were a bit crunchy, but they tasted okay. About an hour after we ate, both my boyfriend and I came down with stomach cramps and some serious gas. We felt horrible for about eight hours. After a little Googling I learned that kidney shaped beans can be toxic and, in rare cases, fatal if undercooked. Moral of the story? You learn something new every day.uncontrollably.",

A few suggestions - the couscous step in the ziploc bag is rather unnecessary. Couscous is extremely easy to prepare. simply mix the cumin, salt, and couscous in a bowl, bring 2 cups of water to boil, turn off the boiling water, add the couscous, cover with a lid, its ready in about 5 min. this is simpler, and more environmentally friendly  than using a ziploc bag each time. this way you can simply stir all your ingredients into the pot that already contains the couscous. Also, like many others here, i browned my onion in some olive oil before adding it. I also add a lot more lime than what is called for. The lime really does make the dish. Great dish.",
