I thought it seemed a bit strange but followed the recipe as stated. As they say, fool me once...  I actually served a dinner party of four (one, a chef) with warm, uncooked fish, bites were taken before we realized what had happened.  I had to pull the plates off the table, pan sear the fillets, and re-serve piles of fish, peppers and tomatoes.  Attractive presentation was long lost.  I also added a shake of chili powder on each, as the paprika sauce itself was a bit one-dimensional.  Please request to have this error fixed before others suffer the same embarrassment - to say nothing of the health implications....",

Noting the other reviews, I combined the oil and spices in a 1 gallon ziploc, coated the filets in the mixture inside, and pan-seared them to seal in the flavor before baking. Put the seared filets atop the veggies, added the 1 c water to the ziploc to incorporate the remaining spices therein, poured that over thew hole dish and baked at 400 for about 30 minutes. Other minor substitutions were orange pepper for red, quartered grape tomatoes for large sliced, and cilantro for parsley.  Served this with a medditerranean quinoa that had chopped shallots, toasted pine nuts and raisins, and lemon feta asparagus - everyone LOVED it. Paired nicely with a dry Prosecco!",

I did follow someone else's comment and baked for 30 to 40 min on 400 degrees. 200 degrees for an hour just didn't sound right. The fish was tender and just melted in our mouths.
