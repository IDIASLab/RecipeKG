                "reviewBody": "This is pretty darn close!  My mother and father were both from Croatia (Mom, Zagreb/ Dad, Trogir) Mom used to make this to go with various meats, Zagreb was North so just like in northern Italy the cooking was more rich (creamy) and where Dad was from in Trogir in the South near Dubrovnik cooking was more comparable to Naples in Italy...spicier and with tomatoes.  Anyway, I digress....Mom used to use milk rather than water, but 75 years ago when I was a child I remember our milk as being much richer (in the US) )than it is today so I used half milk and half cream.  I have a feeling that my grandmother who today would have been 145 years old probably used cream especially since they were farmers and cream would have been in abundance, she may have even put an egg yolk in it!  But this was certainly close enough for my diet today and the way we live.  Thank you for posting this and bringing back the memories!",

The Cevapi were okay on their own but then you add some of this sauce and they came alive. The recipe submitter is right use white wine vinegar only. I use all of the different vinegar's in cooking and white wine is the only one for this one.",
