Used a handful of dried apricots cut into pieces and a tbls of sugar free apricot preserves and 1 tbls of agave (hubby is diabetic). Should have used less olive oil but the flavors were great. This will also go great with chicken (bnls thighs or breasts). Served with tomato corn onion salad from this site; great compliment. Terrific dinner.
