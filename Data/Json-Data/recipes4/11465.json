I pre-cooked a commercial crust let it cool added garlic infused olive oil a little red sauce the yellow tomato slices then sauteed sweet onion mushrooms red peppers and then the goat cheese (maybe 6 ounces rather than just 4). Since the crust was already baked and the veggies sauteed it was just 8 minutes at 450 degrees. Half-way through cooking I added baby spinach leaves and drizzled a little more of the olive oil so the leaves wouldn't dry out too much. Such a treat!",
