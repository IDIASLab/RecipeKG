Add as much water as you need to to thin it out to your liking. That goes for the next day as well. I used mild sausage and only one small pkg of pepperoni slices that I cut in half. I found out a long time ago that noodles sitting in soup makes mush. Cook the noodles first and keep them seperate from the soup until you dish it up. That way the soup won't thicken too much and the noodles stay firm. Hope this helps.",

The only reason I am giving it a 4 and not a 5 is because as written you end up with a pizza bake type thing and not a soup. This definitely requires more water than called for if you want soup. I was afraid I would lose a lot of flavor by adding more water but it really didn't. I added some olives for topping. Very flavorful soup and one I will make again.",

I used ground turkey in place of italian sausage and I only added just a few slices of chopped turkey pepperoni just for the flavor. I did use red and yellow bell peppers as I don't care for green peppers a ton of fresh minced garlic and two cans fire roasted tomatoes. I did cut back on the water a bit and used one can condensed beef broth and I took the suggestion from the recipe's description to add just a little chopped black olives. To make this more pizza-like I added my own pizza seasoning blend which also helps make the ground turkey seem like sausage and adds more flavor instead of fat. I did not add the pasta only because I'm watching my carb intake. I browned the meat and sauteed the vegetables and just threw everything in the crockpot to cook all day. Already an hour and a half in and it smells incredible. This will feed me all week two meals a day it'll be incredibly filling and really low in calories not to mention.....it was cheap to make!",
