        "description": "These veggie balls are high in protein, infused with fresh herbs, rolled with bread crumbs, baked rather than fried, and can be altered based on what ingredients and spices you have on hand. If you don't have some of the fresh herbs or spices on hand, innovate with other herbs or used dried varieties; these will still come out great. These freeze well and are delicious in a wide range of foods. Try forming these into patties and making veggie burgers, or in pasta sauces, etc. Use it in place of falafel. One of my favorite ways is to use these in taco salads and burritos &ndash; saute with some taco seasoning and voila!",

After ten minutes I tried to turn one and it fell apart so I did not turn any of them. I cooked them for another ten minutes. They were quite dry outside even though they remained moist and tender inside. So keep your eye on them those last five minutes. Also read the notes regarding blending the mixture. I will definitely try that next time. Thank you for the recipe.",
