The recipe never calls for slicing the sausage links but that is something you will need to do. On that note I did use the links but next time I will use the ground Italian sausage. Cauliflower is pretty bland and the soup could have used the flavor of the sausage throughout. I used mild sausage because my store didn't have the hot in the links. Because I used the mild I added some crushed chili flakes to my bowl. This is a great soup but I do recommend using ground sausage instead.",
