I am very experienced in frying catfish and have made it coated many different ways and have come to the conclusion that I do not like it double dipped. I like a thin cornmeal/flour combo and so that is the one change I made due to personal preference. I am still giving this a 5 star rating because I am positive it would turn out great as written for the majority of people out there that like the thicker coated fish. If you are sensitive to spice then I recommend leaving the cayenne out of your flour mixture. This was a great way to use fish and one I will make again. Thanks JeffB227!",
