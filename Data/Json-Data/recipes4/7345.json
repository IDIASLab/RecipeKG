They are very good plain but we added them to a packet gravy  serving over egg noodles. YUMMM",

After roasting per recipe I tasted one (YUMMY) and tossed them in a pan with some jarred spaghetti sauce. It's all cooking right now filling the house with yummy smells. Today is national pasta day so we will be having this for dinner tonight. Will definitely make these again doubling the recipe so I'll have left overs.",

The first time I followed the recipe but I doubled it and used basil instead of parsley because I had a fresh bunch. I had hoped to be able to freeze some but they were all gone in 2 days. Today I made them again but used 1 # of turkey and 1#Italian sausage lots of cheese but left out the greens due to not having any on hand. (I think spinach might work in these too.) Hopefully some of this batch will make it to the freezer. Oh and the first time I lined my pan with parchment paper instead of foil and that worked fine. This time I also used Parchment but also put the meatballs on a rack in the pan with great results.",
