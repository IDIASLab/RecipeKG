                "reviewBody": "Very very delicious. I used chicken portions that I had that needed to be used instead of chicken breast meat. And for those that don't have a 48 ounce can of beans in your pantry, it's roughly 3 standard size cans. The dish was successful easy, and overall flavor was really good. My little nit-pick on the recipe was it was a bit runny. It was more like a thick soup and not like a chili. I did mash down the beans in the final step as directed and still found it liquidy, so I added an additional 15.5 ounce can of navy beans and mashed them as well. It helped it a lot better. But reguardless of the additional can. This is a simple and pleasing dish that I will make again.  So thank you Bill. UPDATED: 10/24/14 I changed out the protein for Johnsonville Butcher Shop Style Cheddar Cheese & Bacon Smoked Sausage...OMG was soo good with a dollop of sour cream. A recipe remake on this was totally awesome as this is still a good simple recipe with few ingredients. TY",
