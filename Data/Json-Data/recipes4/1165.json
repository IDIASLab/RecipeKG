Very delicious although I will say it was a tad on the dry side (which I kind of assumed would be the case in looking at the cook time). I used fresh garlic rather than the powder as I generally do. I cannot wait to pass this recipe around to others. One bit of advice would be to line your pan with foil prior to making this - the sauce can get a bit sticky!! Thanks Keith I definately give this one two thumbs up!!:)",

The sauce started to bubble around the edges but that's really it. The flavor was just ok. My husband and I had to add salt but it was still just ok. Kinda disappointed I tried.:(",
