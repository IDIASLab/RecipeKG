I did use low sodium chicken broth in place of water, about 1/2 cup of crumbled bacon and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese in addition to about 8 oz of shredded cheddar. The biggest notation here, though, is the GARLIC! I love garlic but, heeding other reviews, I reduced the garlic by half and it was still a little too much IMO. I use a premium, American grown garlic with zero filler - maybe it's just stronger than some other brands. I did not put the cheese on top because we like to fry our grits before serving them, so I added a little more to the grits, as noted above.",
