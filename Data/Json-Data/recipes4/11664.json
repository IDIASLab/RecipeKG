I gave it 4 stars because 1. the directions don't say when to add the sugar (I did in the first step when prepping the yeast) and 2. It is a LARGE recipe, and when I say large, I mean industrial sized. I halved the recipe and thought the dough was taking over. But it made a very nice and tasty bread. My advice would be to halve the recipe and to it in two stages as I did. I am giving away as Christmas gifts and I kept a loaf for myself...beautiful presentation (I braided the bread as suggested in the recipe) and tastes great.",

It makes 6 large braided loaves and luckily we had a lot of company that night and it all got eaten. My husband said it didn't taste like the polish bread he remembered but it was really good. It makes a lightly sweet bread. I loved it.",

Everyone loved it :) I baked it the day before Easter, and halved the recipe to make three loaves: the first was devoured within a couple hours after it had cooled, and the flavour and texture was reminiscent of Portuguese or Hawaiian sweetbread. The rest of it was saved for dinner the next day-- wasn't as soft and moist as it was the day before, but still sweet and delicious, and perfect with a bit of softened butter :) Overnight I had the loaves wrapped in a tea towel, and I think they might have dried out a bit-- next time I'll try a plastic bag and see if it helps!",
