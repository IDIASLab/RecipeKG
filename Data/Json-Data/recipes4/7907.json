This was easy to make and the vanilla ice cream did help cut the sweetness so that it didn't taste too sweet. I added cinnamon to the apple pie filling and sprinkled a bit of the cinnamon on top of  the cake mix. I also added a half teaspoon of pure vanilla extract to the butter before drizzling on top. Oh, and I let it bake for about 2 minutes extra because it didn't seem brown enough. By the time I took it out of the oven, the apple pie filling was bubbling up through spots.",

Pulled it out and found some powdered areas so I used a fork to mix those areas with fruit under them.  Then once all was wet, I put 30 pecan half's on top, and put it back in the oven for 15 minutes until it browned slightly.  I will definitely make again.",
