I generally made as directed halving the cayenne and adding 2t crushed ginger and 2t crushed garlic. I used the full amount of vinegar and loved it as did all the guests. I love vinegar in general but I got the impression everyone else did too so I'm not sure what to say about some of the other reviews. Maybe know your own vinegar preferences and start with half and adjust to your personal taste I guess.",
