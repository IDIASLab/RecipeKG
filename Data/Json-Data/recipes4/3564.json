Since the average person has to get their ingredients from supermarkets Port Salut cheese is probably the best substitute for the difficult to find Reblochon. That said you are MUCH better off using chopped Pancetta (which you won't have to drain) than bacon. A couple of cloves of garlic go very well in with the onions and bacon/pancetta. Also I would recommend only half-pre-cooking the potatoes in step 1 then slicing them and then frying them in withe the frying pan items before putting them in the baking dish. Perhaps most importantly this dish was MADE for Thyme - add 1/2 tbsp of thyme to the cream and wine before baking too. Yummy! Great addition to the site!",

I found several Youtube videos of this dish and might try one of those next time. Lots of variations of this recipe. Most of them used brie which helps with the pocket book!
