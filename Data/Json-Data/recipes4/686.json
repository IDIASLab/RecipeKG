Baked the potatoes at 400 for about 50 minutes on a stoneware pan - crispy and delicious. Didn't feel so guilty about them by omitting all the butter..",

I added a dash of onion/garlic powders to the flour/parm mix and be sure to keep an eye on these (stirring occassionaly is a must) so that they don't get stuck to the bottom of the baking dish.

First of all, like many reviewers, I cut the butter down to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup olive oil. Omitted flour completely, and added dried parsley flakes, thyme, paprika, crushed red pepper flakes, a shake or 2 of Montreal chicken grill seasoning. Baked @ 375 for 1 hour, turned the oven up to 425 for last half hour. I also turned the potatoes every 20 to 30 mins. or so for even browning. Husband loved!!",
