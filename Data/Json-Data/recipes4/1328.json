It wasn't too cheesy this way. Really good recipe -- thank you.",

I warmed white corn tortillas to softened them dipped them (both sides) in the warm Cowboy Dip filled them with about a tablespoon of heated leftover shredded chicken and some shredded cheese. I suppose these could be held in a warm oven until you assemble as many as you want but I served then immediately and just made more as we went along. The oven might dry them out too much. I also added more cheese to the top. Voila! My SO who is mexican wanted to know what the \"gravy\" was.... he said these were excellent! I served them with a salad and the borracho beans also from All Recipes. I hope you try this and enjoy it too! I served this to my card club and everyone loved it. It's not the healthiest dish but what the heck... Thanks! I did add more hot sauce and used 1 lb of the Mexican velveeta... next time I will increase the \"cheese\"... I felt it needed more. For the person who said mashing the tamales was \"messy\"... I used my handy-dandy old fashioned potato masher and it was a breeze! This does make alot so be prepared to share!

We used a potato masher to mash up the tamales which worked fabulously. Much less messy than mashing with a fork. The appearance of the dish isnt the most appealling (it looks kinda like a refried bean dip) but all the guests at the Christmas party last night devoured it. I got lots of compliments and will definately do it again. We bought two bags of chips (one bag of tortilla chips one of corn chips) and ran out...I will do three bags next time.",
