Great...will definitely make this again!",

I love jalapenos and cheese so gave this a shot. This is actually not a souffle but more of a quiche. I like this better because the quiche allows me to freeze or reheat leftovers to bring for breakfast at work. I used a greased 2 qt souffle mold 4 jumbo sz eggs cheddar cheese and only 7 oz can of jalapenos. That was enough to put plenty of jalapeno in every bite. Suggest adding eggs and/or adjust jalapeno amounts to suit personal tastes.",
