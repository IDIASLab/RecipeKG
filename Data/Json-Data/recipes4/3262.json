So next time I will add the peanut butter by tablespoonfuls at a time tasting after each addition. Otherwise it is a good full flavored soup. A little goes a long way and is good with toasted buttered bread points. I feel it's more for a Thai starter dish before the actual main meal because of the richness. The soup takes on a much better flavor after sitting for a few hours. Makes all the difference. Update: After making this a few times now I only use 1/2 can coconut milk. (We just like the flavor better.) Another update: I've noticed some brands of peanut butter are milder than others thus taking more.",

It didn't turn out as thick or sweet as I wanted so I added a little sugar and some cornstarch mixed with coconut milk near the end. Garnished with peanuts & chopped cilatro. Mixed leftovers with cooked chopped chicken - awesome. Thanks Jennifer!",
