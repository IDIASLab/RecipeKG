(And, at least where I come from, we don't use veggies, etc.; it's pretty much chicken cooked in water/stock with a little celery, onion, salt and pepper.  Then the chicken meat is removed from the bones, fat, etc. and returned to the pot with the strained stock.  Dumplings are made with cold water, rolled and cut into strips.)  So, I wasn't looking for veggies or anything, but this was still a huge miss for me.  I don't know exactly what I didn't like about it.  Perhaps there was too much cream of chicken soup?  And, the biscuit dumplings weren't right, even cooked they were too puffy and doughy.  Maybe if I'd rolled the biscuits and then cut them and reduced the cream of chicken soup to one can?  I'm just not sure.  Anyway, I'm glad so many others have loved this recipe - only wish I felt the same.",
