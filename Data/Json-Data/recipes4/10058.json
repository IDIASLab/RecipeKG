Depending on the density of split peas, it may take a while for the vegetables and peas to soften, but you can't really overcook this soup; just stir occasionally, and add water if it gets too dry. Seasonings can be altered to taste. Tastes even better reheated.",

I omitted the barley, and I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil.  I sauteed the onion, celery and (3) bay leaves together.  I also omitted the potatoes, and put all of the herbs in the pot with the peas and 8 c. water, rather than waiting until the peas had cooked 2 hours.  The only ingredient I added after cooking for 2 hours was the carrots.  After adding them and another cup of water, I let the soup simmer about 1 more hour.\r\nIt's really a delicious, hearty soup. I didn't find it to be too thick, possibly because I soaked the peas first.",

All 7 1/2 cups of the water was used up and the solid then started to burn the bottom of the pan.  I added 4 more cups of water, which turned out to be PERFECT, so I'd definitely recommend using a total of 11 1/2 cups water for anyone making this soup!  The taste was delicious, and I blended abotu half the soup for a better consistency, but either way it tastes fine, just depends on your preference.  I only used one potato cause that's all I had around the house but it was still good.  Definitely one of the best soup recipes I've tasted!  Thanks!!",

I make a double batch of this soup for my friends when they have new babies some of my friends can't wait to give birth so they can get some more from me! Here are a few of my alterations-I ommit the celery use a few cups of chicken broth in place of a bit of water and add the spices after the first boil so the flavor can grow and infuse as it cooks. Also I start the soup first thing in the morning so that it simmers for 8-10 hours before supper. It really is a great recipe and it freezes well for a couple of months.

I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added a lot of extra water (about 3-5 more cups), and this soup still came out nice and thick.  Also, although this soup has a wonderful flavor when made as instructed, I am not a big fan of parsley, so next time I will not use as much.  I think I will also skip the potato next time so the split pea flavor is not compromised.  All in all, this is a GREAT recipe...just tweek it a bit here and there to make it yours.  I recommend serving split pea soup with croutons and a few (or many) splashes of red wine vinegar.",

Since so many reviewers recommended adding more water, I used 12 cups of water and doubled the spices. This worked out well. However, next time I will not add the barley. That is what thickens this soup. If you make it without the barley, it will not be so thick. If you do find it needs to be thickened when it is done, you can always add some instant mashed potatoes flakes. That will thicken it up nicely.",
