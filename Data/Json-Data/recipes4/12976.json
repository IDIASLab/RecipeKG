I would use butternut squash or acorn squash next time. My mother who made this dish back in the old country recommended trying it with butternut squash. You can also use this receipe with chicken instead of beef if you like. My father in law wanted to add Cumin since it was missing just a tad flavor. Overall it is a nice basic soup and I followed the receipe 100% as written. I was hoping to impress but instead got a cooking lesson at dinner.",

Then the next morning I cut the top off a pumpkin and saved the top for later. Meanwhile I had some other pumpkin chunks I added to the stew and let it simmer for another 2 hrs. I transported part of the stew into the pumpkin and baked it with a foil on top. I baked it for another hr but I think that was too long. The bottom started to leek. I would say maybe 20 minuted would have enough time for the pumpkin to bake. The top was too big for it to fit in the oven on the pumpkin so I cooked it for about 30 minutes so it would have an even color. This was an excellent recipe my whole family loved but the only problem I saw was cooking the pumpkin too long. Other than that A",

My stew came out more hearty than more liquid...and was so flavorful! I had some cumin just in case but did not need it. This is my first time making a pumpkin beef stew and I can't wait to bring it to my parents' home for Thanksgiving! It's so tender that it won't ruin my mother's dentures! lol",
