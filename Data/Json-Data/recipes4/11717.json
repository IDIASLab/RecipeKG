I used 1/2 of a large onion cut in 'rings ' instead of chopping the onions and a smaller cut of meat; I cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/8 tsp. to make it less spicy. I would recommend mixing the spices with the tomato mixture; otherwise they 'bake' on the top and don't get mixed in. I added 1/2 tsp. salt before cooking then another 1/2 tsp. after. Will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!",

Even though the smell was unappetizing I decided to taste it anyway hoping that it tasted better than it smelled (like corned beef and cabbage tastes better than it smells) but unfortuantely for me it tasted exactly like it smelled. I wasted money on this recipe because I had to throw it away since no one in my house would touch it. It even took me three days to get rid of the smell from the house. I am a lover of curry but this recipe is definitely not for me. It should not even get a 1 star but that was as low as I could rate it.",

I threw this surprisingly simple recipe together last Sunday and let it simmer all day - what a delicious treat in the evening! NO bitter aftertaste was present for us. I followed the recipe pretty closely though I didn't layer quite as suggested rather I stirred all spice ingredients into tomato paste mixture then mixed it up with the beef & onion - I didn't have ground coriander...also as with almost everything we make I squeazed lime juice over it before cooking and added more/tweaked the spices as the day wore on. This was a very underrated dish in my opinion which yielded beautiful results for my family. Thanks ChezDeb!:)",
