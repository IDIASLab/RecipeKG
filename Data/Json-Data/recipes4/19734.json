I cut it from 6  to 3 portions, and it called for only 1/4 c water. When I finished the IP pressure cook, the pasta was stuck together and barely cooked. I used up adding another 1/2 c water and running it thru another IP cycle,then another full cup. By then it was cooked, but still a lot of it was stuck together and crunchy. I see now though if you just half the recipe, 2 cups of water would be correct for 8 oz of pasta. Still yummy, and I\u2019ll make it again, but take a look at the adjustment function!",
