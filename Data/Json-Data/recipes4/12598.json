This is the first time despite a number of culinary misadventures that I've had to resort to a backup dinner. Giving the benefit of the doubt I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with 1 TEASPOON of salt per serving. Had my family eaten this dish we would have been dessicated corpses come morning. If I hazard a guess through the overriding saltiness this dish seems like it might have had an interesting flavor. It was too soupy though and had to be served in a bowl with spoons instead of the standard plate and fork I would expect with a casserole. I don't think I'm curious enough to even try it again with modifications but I did return it to the oven with some cut up potatoes to leech the salt to see if any salvaging could be done.",

I used only 1 cup of milk for the sauce, 1/2 t each of curry powder, garlic powder & seasoned salt along with the soup, Worchestershire sauce & paprika.  I did not use any additional salt or pepper.  I added extra cheese (1 cup total), a can of green beans & some French fried onions on top (last 10 min of baking).  The sauce came out thick & very tasty.  It smelled wonderful while baking, too!  I will certainly make this again.",
