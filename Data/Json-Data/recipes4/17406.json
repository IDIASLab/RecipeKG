I added about 1.5tsp of salt to really bring out the flavors. The only change I made was that I started out with 5 cups of water instead of 4. I figured with it simmering for so long a lot of liquid would evaporate and for 5 servings I thought it could use the extra liquid. The 5 cups I started with reduced down to 4 cups of finished broth which was perfect. I'll be making this one again. It's the perfect summer soup at a time of year when you don't normally crave soup!",
