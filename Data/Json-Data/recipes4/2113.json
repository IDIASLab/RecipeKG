While you are preparing the meal you should put in a good CD ( I chose The Gipsy Kings ) and have a beer or a glass of wine. I have a wife who does not like \"gamey\" tasting deer meat and I promised that I would find a way that she would eat the meat. This was it without a doubt! The meat was tender and tasty. I modified the recipe a little because I added a slice of onion in the preparation and instead of tooth picks I just put the poppers on a kabob skewer. My wife doesn t like Bacon much either (too much fat) so instead of wrapping her pieces in Bacon I just laid it on top of her skewer while I grilled them then removed the bacon before serving. I complimented the poppers with a side dish comprised of heated Caned Corn Black Beans red onions and Avocado as well as a baked potato. Everything was perfect along with a beer for me and a glass of Shiraz for my wife. Hope you enjoy!",

I left out the Greek and steak seasonings marinated the jalapeno slices with the meat put the jalapeno slice on top of the bacon rolled venison( this makes it easier to be removed and looks good on the serving tray) Then I lightly sprinkled with Montreal seasoning and baked at 400 degrees for ten minutes and then crisped them up in the broiler.

I used Wish-Bone Robusto Italian dressing with a couple squirts of A1 Chicago Steakhouse liquid marinade as I did not have \"steak seasoning\" on hand. I used thick sliced bacon and de-seeded the peppers then sliced them into thin slices to reduce the \"heat\". I used a Weber charcoal grill...make sure you lower the heat. You do not want the bacon to burn. Also one more tip: If you forget to soak your toothpicks just put them in a cup of water and micowave for a few minutes! Everyone loved them!

I usually make a stew or just cut it up and stir fry it on the stove top for wraps. i Wanted to grill it and found this recipe and since my garden is overrun with jalapenos I gave it a try. I cut my meat into 2 by 3 inch chunks and marinated them for about ten hours. I used the exact marinade and spices except I also used a few dashes of Teriyaki sauce. I used a whole piece of bacon to wrap with and put a jalapeno slice on one side of the meat and on the other a slice of sweet onion and wrapped tightly pretty much covering the whole chunk of meat. We grilled on charcoal with a direct side and indirect heat side that way we could move the pieces that were done first to the indirect side while working on the ones that still needed to cook more. Turn these constantly while cooking and be careful because bacon drippings will send up some flames once in awhile. Once the bacon was pretty crispy and even getting a bit blackened we removed them from the heat. It took about 20 - 30 minutes for each over medium high coals to cook depending on their size. Oh wow... were these ever tender and tasty and even the bacon was cooked to perfection. The jalapeno gave just enough spice not too much. I will be telling my bro about this one. We served this with Coleslaw with a kick here on AR was a perfect match together.",
