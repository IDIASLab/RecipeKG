I sliced celery carrot onion garlic and potato in the food processor then saut\u00e9ed veggies in butter. I used one can of cream of chicken soup with five additional cans of water. I then poured two cups of leftover Frank's Red Hot chicken wing sauce and added four chicken bouillon cubes into the crockpot. Lastly I added one large raw chicken breast spices and the saut\u00e9ed veggie mix to the crockpot and cooked it on high for a total of four hours. The chicken breast was cooked within two hours and I pulled it out and shredded the meat with a fork and then placed it back into the crockpot. I served the soup with a dollop of sour cream shredded mozzarella cheese and chives fresh from the garden. Can t wait to make this soup again during the cold winter months best soup I ve made this year!",

I also couldn't resist adding some minced garlic and a little shaker parm, as our very wings are garlic parm.  It cooked on low all day while we were out and we arrived home to the smell of wings.  While we both enjoyed it, we also agreed it wasn't something we'd really want/make again, hence the 4 stars.  If you're a fan of wings, it's def worth givinig a try.  Mr. LTH can be a big sissy when it comes to hot and he had no issues w/this.  (Photo to follow as soon as I can get it to upload...)",

I also did 2 cans of condensed cream of chicken, and added in 2.5 cups of chicken broth. I omitted the celery, and rather than pre-cooking and shredding the chicken I put in 3 breasts frozen and cooked on low for about 8 hours. In the morning, the chicken fell apart with tongs and was cooked through. The extra water from the uncooked chicken diluted the spice a bit (I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce), so I added some to my husband's lunch. It was the perfect amount of spice for me (I'm a wuss). I also omitted the clue cheese, and used cheddar because that's what we had, and just used it as a garnish on each dish. DELIC!",
