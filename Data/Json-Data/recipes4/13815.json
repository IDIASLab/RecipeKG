I would also suggest waiting until about 15 minutes before the soup is ready to add the macaroni that way it will not get starchy.",

I cooked the pasta and rice separtately so it wouldn't get mushy if left in the soup. My family loved this recipe and rest assured I will be making this through out the chilly months to come.",

The beef broth with the crushed tomato puree and the cup of red wine made a superb broth! I believe that this recipe would be very \"forgiving\" if you made some small substitutions just don't mess with the broth...it is perfection!",
