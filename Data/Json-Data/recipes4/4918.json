So in place of the sauce I just got a package of Lawrys Sundried tomato and garlic sauce, and Mixed that in.  She also does not like spicy as well, so I cut out the peppers and put in paprika in place.  But followed the rest of the recipie to a T.  I Put it all on a bed of pasta,(would also go well with rice) and It came out with a VERY light Mediterranean taste.  Definately season with salt and black pepper at the end, but it came out SO Flavorful!  My wife said it was restraunt quality. I am rating this a 5 because this is a very EASY recipie with good results at the end.",

It's actually more of a pur\u00e9e. Look for Goya tomato sauce in little cans. Also I'm assuming \"fresh\" shrimp means uncooked. I couldn't find any uncooked shrimp on sale so I added cooked shrimp but not until the final 5 minutes when the tomato sauce went in. Any earlier than that and the shrimp will get mushy. I served over white rice and if you want the full experience make some plantain slices fried in olive oil as the side. There was a decent amount of leftovers even after 2 large plates each.",
