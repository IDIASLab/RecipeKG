I couldn't find fresh lemon grass so used a jar of dried. I also left out the garlic salt and added a clove of minced garlic. Nothing in the dish has an over powering flavor and we couldn't get enough of it at our house. I was concerned about the 3 tablespoons of chile paste but the dish had an undertone of spiciness but wasn't hot at all. In fact I planned to give my 4 yo a hotdog but she not only ate some but asked for seconds.",

The flavor was pretty good but something in the seasonings was a little off--too much coriander? Too much sake? I'm not sure. I made this according to the recipe except for substituting shallots for onions and crushed garlic for garlic salt. Oh well--I might try it again only on the stove and I might reduce the marinade for a glaze. However for all of you out there who love this recipe but are having a hard time finding lemongrass--one trip to an Asian grocery store and one good growing season and you can have a pot full of lemongrass--the stalks will grow roots if they're fresh enough and placed in water for a few weeks. Just keep your cats away from them--mine go nuts for lemongrass.",
