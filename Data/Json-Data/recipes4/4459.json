I have a keen appreciation for pate and this recipe does not disapoint.  \r\n\r\nI made certain to soak the livers for several hours (at least 4) in milk and it's very important not to rinse before adding to the skillet.  Also, very important to use a good wine as the flavor will be concentrated.  Crappy wine = crappy flavor.\r\n\r\nI've made this dish with pork livers as well, and while it was also excellent, I personally perfer the flavor of chicken livers as opposed to pork.  \r\n\r\nI've shared this recipe with several of my family and friends and they too claim its the best and easiest (least involved) pate they've made.\r\n\r\nGood job!
