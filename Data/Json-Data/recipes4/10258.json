Just be sure to line the pan with foil as indicated (don't use cooking spray) and when drying the roast be gentle and try not to remove the spices.

The roast itself comes out delicious. Don't buy a cheap roast - this recipe won't make tough meat any more tender (go with a slow cooker reciped if you have a cheap roast sitting around). Oh and ignore the \"sodium\" amount in the nutrition info - obviously it's wrong because it figures you'll consume the salt.",
