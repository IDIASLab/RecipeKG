Because I had a larger whole pork loin I added slightly less water than stuffing called for and used a package of frozen thawed spinach (squeezed dry) for added color/texture/bulk. In my experience it's good to butterfly or split the roast on the \"fat\" side and after tying it with kitchen twine cook it with the fat side up. This infuses the roast with its own flavor/juices and there's no need to wrap in bacon to have a tender moist roast. If your loin is very lean without natural fat the bacon may help but decrease the salt you'd normally use.",
