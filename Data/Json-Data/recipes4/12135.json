Added 1 1/2 cups chicken broth, 1/2 can tomato sauce, cumin, and salt.  After liquid became creamy I added the 2nd half of the sauce as directed.So I really didn't change it up that much. Just added personal tastes.  I will definetly use this recipe again. Oh..when I ate it I had shredded chicken with white corn tortillas on the side.  THIS ONE IS A KEEPER!",
