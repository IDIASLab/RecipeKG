I remember we loved this as children and it served a lot of people.  Gramma's version featured only bananas for fruit. She also used Dream Whip&reg; to top it. I added the extra fruit and used real whipped cream because let's face it; Dream Whip&reg; just doesn't hold the appeal it did in the late 60's!",
