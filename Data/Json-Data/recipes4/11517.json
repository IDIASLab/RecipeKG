I love creole & cajun food but am not too fond of rice this was great because the sauce was the right consistency for pasta (which isn't always the case if you swap pasta for rice). I read all the comments regarding the spiciness and the amount of creole seasoning & saltiness. I think it has a lot to do the the brand of seasoning you use as well as your family's tastes. I keep 2 or 3 different kinds in the spice rack they vary greatly in heat and I know how much of each one my family can tolerate & how salty they are. I would never put 3T in of a seasoning blend I wasn't familiar with. As it was I used 1T of my hot one to give it heat (we like heat) and 2T of a mild one to give it a depth of creole flavor besides hot.",

Although I thought it was pretty mild - had it been any spicier, my family wouldn't have been able to eat as much as they did. Also, I reduced the garlic powder/lemon pepper seasoning by half (again, to keep it kid friendly) and used regular chicken broth. If you like \"spicy\" foods, I'd use 2 TBLS of seasoning and if you like it \"hot\" I'd use all three. Since it was now only mildly spiced, my family gave this dish 2 thumbs up! Thanks Michelle.",

I'm not sure if it was the creole season I used (Tony's) or the fact that I didn't use low sodium broth? This was my first time to try Andouille and I loved the flavor. I sliced instead of diced it but this would have not altered the flavor of the dish. I will definitely make this again and just cut back on the creole season and use low sodium broth. One other note is that I grilled my sausage first and then just added it in the end but only because I like my sausage really brown/black:)",
