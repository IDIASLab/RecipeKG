However, it\u2019s very easy to add additional flavors, as I added minced fresh rosemary to half the batch.  I docked the crackers just as a precaution of them puffing up.  Also, I made the crackers very thin and they didn\u2019t need more than 10 minutes of baking, so I recommend checking them often when baking.",

I made them with my pasta maker instead of rolling them out, which I found faster and less messy. I  brushed the tops with olive oil then sprinkled on some onion powder and sesame seeds. I didn't bother cutting them into cracker size servings, but left them as long lasagna type lengths to be broken to size as they were eaten. They disappeared in a flash!!",

The third batch I sprinkled parmesan cheese and a little more adobo. After 8 minutes I had crackers so delicious that I will never buy them at the store again!!",
