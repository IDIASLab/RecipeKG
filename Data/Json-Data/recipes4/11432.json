Reduced calories/fats/etc. by using less olive oil to cook the asparagus; egg substitute and low-fat mozzarella cheese. Kept the real/fresh Parmesan cheese so the dish still had lots of flavor. Because I don't have an oven-safe skillet I poured the mixture into an oven-safe baking dish to pop under the broiler and to serve from directly. Will KEEP this recipe in my collection.",

To the ingredients I added 1 tsp. hot sauce, 1/2 tsp. salt and 3 Tbsp crumbled bacon (I think these were suggested in an earlier review).  In the instructions under #2 I changed the cooking time for the asparagus to 6 minutes - 10 would have been WAY too long and the mushrooms only needed to be cooked 3 minutes.  Under #3 I only had to cook the egg mixture for 2-3 minutes.  Under #4 I baked the 10 minutes but it was very brown and close to burnt - I would adapt this to 7-10 minutes and watch it closely.  The cheese needs to be broiled about 1-2 minutes.  This is going in the KEEPER file!!  Thank you!",

Oh and I didn't have parmesan or mozzarella so used some white cheddar. Turned out quite well - husband ate more than half & had some for leftovers the next day. Served with a small green salad and some prosecco - delicious!",
