Also if the extra liquid from the kraut juice causes your balls to be too moist (haha) then simply add an additional TB or 2 of flour. These had a really great flavor and if made properly are GREAT!!! Thanks for the recipe:)",

I'm just an impatient cook. The reason some cooks didn't like this recipe is the reason I thought it was fine: you don't really taste the sauerkraut. That's good for me bc I don't like it. Instead of chopping I plopped it in the food processor until it was mostly chopped. That worked well enough. The balls were a bit difficult to form and I was getting tired and hungry so I used my medium cookie scoop to help the process along. I squished the mix into the scoop as hard as I could then I shaped into a ball the rest of the way. I got large balls that way. I dipped mine in sweet and sour sauce and bf dipped his in bbq sauce.
