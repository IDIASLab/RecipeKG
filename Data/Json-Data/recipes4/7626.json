As written it would make a massive amount of food, based on the other reviews here are the changes I made and my house full of picky boys + husband loved it, called it homemade hamburger helper.  Used one lb. of ground beef and the whole 12 oz. pkg of noodles which was a perfect meat to noodle ratio and filled the 9X13 dish perfectly.  I did cook the noodles but to al dente.  Adjusted the other ingredients to:  1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup of corn (mine was frozen so I thawed it first), 1 cup of sour cream, tablespoon of worchestershire, added about a cup of shredded cheddar into the meat/noodle mixture and salt and pepper to taste.  Cooked it for 20 minutes and then topped it with more shredded cheese and cooked 10 minutes more. I think it would also be delicious with corn + pico de gallo if you wanted some more flavor and spice.  Thank you for this recipe, it's an easy and filling week night meal!",

I added about a half cup water when I noticed the noodles weren't getting tender in the oven.\n\nNext time I will add at least one cup water to the skillet before transferring to the casserole dish.\n\nI also used onion flakes rather than a fresh green onion as my guys don't like so much onion flavor.\n\nOne other note:  this recipe makes more than will fit in a 9x13 casserole dish. I put the extra in a deep 4 cup casserole dish.\n\nOther than that mix-up, my family loved this!  I have picky eaters in my house so this was a winner.  Thanks for the recipe.",

There was easily enough for 10 people. Some other reviewers questioned whether or not to cook the noodles or add water- I did NOT pre-cook the noodles but did add about half a cup of water because I was worried about it. This was unnecessary. I ended up upping the temp to 375 and cooking for about 15 minutes extra to thicken up the dish. So just follow the recipe but do mix half the cheese in or layer it with the meat mixture instead of putting it all on top.",
