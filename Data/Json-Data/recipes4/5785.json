I love the look browning the orzo gives the final dish so I start with a couple tablespoons of butter in the pan and toss in the orzo and stir it around until some of the grains are slightly golden. I then toss in the garlic for about 30 seconds, stirring it around in the pan. Next I add the water (or some chicken broth if I have some in the refrigerator) to the pan, using only about a cup plus a splash. Close the lid and simmer until al dente. The pasta will absorb all the liquid with no need to drain. Each brand of pasta is different but I like to use the blue box variety and nine minutes is al dente and not starchy at all. So watch your pasta closely. Finish off by adding the milk (or cream) and freshly grated parmesan. I love the splash of color the chopped parsley gives this dish. Delicious simple side dish!",

I've tried a few orzo dishes that we liked but this hands down has been our favorite. I did not measure the milk I just added it until it had the consistency I was looking for. It paired very nicely with 'Simple Slow Roast Chicken' from AR and a tossed salad. Thanks leogrl for the recipe and your correction.",

I also used a half cup of parmesan cheese (not fresh the kroger brand in the round plastic container and it still pulled in strings like fresh cheese)as well as a heaping tablespoon of dried parsley flakes (kroger brand) and a half a cup of vit D milk and it turned out fantastic!!! The reason I am writing this is just to say you dont have to go the expensive route to still get a great taste and I had all of these things in the house and didnt have to buy anything speacial this was a perfect size side dish for my 10 year old daughter and I. I served this with one large chicken breast cut in half and pounded coated with flower egg and galic and cheese croutons crushed (kroger brand) fried in the skillet with extra virgin olive oil (some things have to be the good stuff lol) would definately recamend this for a fast cheap and tasty side!!",
