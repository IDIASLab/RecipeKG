For the second batch, I put some uncooked rice underneath the chicken, ham, cheese and soup mixture.  The rice soaked up all of the juices and was super yummy.

Instead of all the messy egg/milk wash and breading in all that oil, I just quickly stirfry the chicken plain in an oil sprayed pan,then add the cooked chicken cubes with the cubed ham & cubed cheese in the dish, pour the soup over & I used sour cream like another reviewer said, then topped with a bread crumb topping mix of crushed bread crumbs & a couple of crushed ritz (2 or 3 only)  My family liked this but I really liked how easy it was - especially if you've got all the cubes done earlier!  thanks for a good base!",

I coated the chicken cubes in Italian bread crumbs. I also added chopped onions when browning the chicken. Instead of the 1 cup of milk I used 1/2 Cup and a 1/2 cup sour cream. It was not too runny for us. Just a nice sauce. I just mine over white rice. My hubby thought it would be better with little red potatoes so I will try that next time. I will surely make this again.",
