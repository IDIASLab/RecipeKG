This recipe was a completely new thing for me to make so I want to write some tips. The recipe is not so difficult as seems. When you make the dough it will have a creamy consistency. Don t be afraid it must be creamy. It will become thick after refrigerating (I refrigerated for 3 hours). I made stencils (rounds) on a parchment paper with a pencil using a plate (10 centimeter). Then turn your parchment paper upside down otherwise the trace of the pencil can be on your baked cigar. Be sure to make a thin layer your cigars will look more beautiful and you will be able to put more filling inside. I baked the dough for 5 min and I think to rotate the baking sheet is useless. I rolled the dough without any problem tearing or sticking. I tried to use a wooden spoon but my cigar sticked to the spoon so I rolled just using my fingers. Believe me it is easy to roll. The filling was very tasty I use only 2 cups whipped cream. But we didn t like the dough so much. I expected the cigars will be dry like waffles for ice cream but the dough was soft similar to roulade dough. And I had a trouble to fill the cigar with the cream completely. I didn t use grated chocolate to dip the ends. Overall the recipe is unusual but in my opinion doesn t deserve a time and ingrediends wasted on it.",
