I never skimp on flavor even when I'm eating light. This dish is a total flavor bomb, filled with a rich broth, tender meat, and noodles, topped with a 7-minute egg &ndash; my new favorite thing in the world. My family went nuts for this; it's complex, easy, and satisfying. You don't have to make the egg, but I think it's so worth it.",

I like the combination of leafy and crunchy that using bok choy gives to a dish.  I also cut a carrot into matchstick just to give it some color.\nI made the broth as written and it was amazing.   I'm not a huge fan of soft boiled eggs so I  decided to top mine off with a poached egg instead.   AWESOME!\n I will definitely be making this one again.",

Gluten free son used rice noodles and the rest of us used the ramen noodles he leaves behind when he steals the flavor packs to use.",
