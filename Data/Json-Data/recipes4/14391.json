One of the other reviewers commented that it took a lot of water to cover the carcass. My fiancee fixed this problem by taking out the largest knife he had and hacking the carcass in half and then in smaller pieces. It's also a good idea to do this for the larger bones too. Inside the bones is where a lot of the flavor and collagen(which thicken the broth) are. It'll fit easier in the pot and make a great broth. For those of you who already put too much water in, long cook times. Leave the pot on the stove for 2-3 hours and cook down the broth, concentrating the flavor until it tastes good. If you didnt use all the drippings for gravy, you could add a small amount in for a very intense turkey flavor.",

Perhaps that was the reason that the broth itself didn't have much flavor or maybe more cardamom pods cloves star anise pods ginger fennel and cordiander seeds are needed? I feel that I could have omitted the turkey carcass and the boiling for 2 hours and just used a carton of chicken broth since the flavor of the spices was so very subtle in the broth.",

I had already made turkey broth from the carcass of our Thanksgiving turkey yesterday and picked the meat off of the bone before I discovered this recipe so here's how I proceeded: I went ahead and toasted the star anise fennel seed and whole cloves. I skipped the cardomom pod as I didn't have any. I removed the spiced to a piece of cheesecloth as sugested. I then charred the fresh gingerc and then added it to the cheesecloth as well. I charred two thick slices of onion in the pan but rather than adding those to the stock I just chopped them up to add on top later. I then made the sachet and added it to my already made broth brought it to a boil and continued to simmer while I prepared the rice noodles. I should also mention that I didn't have coriander seed so I just added about 1/4 tsp of ground coriander directly to the broth. We DID use the optional basil cilantro (which really makes the dish - so don't skip those). We served it with sliced lime and Sriracha. I've been wanted to make a Pho for quite some time now and I'm so glad I made this one. Will make again for sure!",

In addition to starting out with more in the beginning I also take out the small strainer I use and refill it with fresh spices about halfway through. I don't know if this makes sense or not but if this doesn't happen I end up with a flavorless soup base. I use tons of ginger (I have used the kind in the squeeze bottle and end up using about half the bottle!). Lastly I add a bit of brown sugar.
