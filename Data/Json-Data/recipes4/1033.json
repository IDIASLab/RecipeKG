The roast I bought was very mishapen, so instead of using a rotissarie, I used a slow cooker.  I unfortunately didn't have teriyaki sauce, but the next best thing I mixed up some soy sauce and sugar and a bit of wine.  I mixed all the ingrediants together and put it in the slow cooker with the roast.  It turned out splendidly and made the whole house smell like heaven!",

But, if you don't want to part with your beer your could easily sub beef broth. I didn't have fresh ginger root, so I used 1 tsp. of ginger powder. For the onion, I used 3 green onions finely chopped. I poked the meat and put everything into a ziploc bag and let it go for 48 hours which I highly recommend. We put this over our rotisserie and took it off when it reached 160 degrees which is for medium well. The meat was so tender and juicy! Our guests raved about this! I would definitely make this again.",

I did not use the beer as I never buy beer so had none on hand. I used some orange juice instead to thin the marinade mixture and since the teriyaki sauce had ginger in it, and I also had no fresh ginger on hand, I did not add the fresh ginger. So those were the only ingredient changes. Instead of grilling it, I browned it on all sides in a skillet and then baked it in the oven at 350 for about 3 hrs. It was a 3lb roast (I like my meat very well done which was my reason for not using the grill) This was moist and delicious. The next time I make this, which will be soon, I will brown it on the grill and finish it in the oven as it generated a lot of smoke on the stove. Happy to report that this was a big hit not only for dinner but the left overs made excellent shredded beef sandwiches the next day. ( I shredded the beef and warmed it with more BBQ sauce for another delicious meal). Thanks for the recipe Sue! ",
