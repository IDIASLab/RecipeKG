Next time I think I will start with 3 cups of chix stock and 2 cups of beef stock to approximate what I did this time.",

The soup is thick almost no broth not as flavorful and the beef is still chewy though the vegies are perfect. Next time I stewed the beef in advance so it holds its shape but falls apart when bitten into adding it and the juices in last 20 min to warm and integrate. I used 4 cups of beef broth and 3 cups of water. I prefer more carrots so I used 2 cups and omitted the mushrooms and frozen vegies. It was perfect.
