I added about a tablespoon of ginger and it really gave it some kick also I used half cup canola oil and half a cup great olive oil and doubled the honey. It tastes great without the ginger but I am a huge ginger fan. For those that want a bit of a peanuty taste you can use 1/3 cup peanut oil 1/3 vegetable and 1/3 olive. I just added some chopped pistachios on top of my salad and I got a great crunch and taste from the nuts! Overall great simple tasty salad dressing. Thanks",
