I made it quite a few times before it was even published trying to drink more green smoothies. It is still my favorite. Only change I make is I use a frozen orange. I also don't have an ice crusher and typically use about 8 ice cubes to equal 1 cup. I prefer the green grapes to keep the pretty green color and I have never tried it with the (optional) flax. Canned unsweetened pineapple in juice works great too believe that is what I typically use as I have it in the house year round. I make 1/2 recipe and get 2 servings. Glad this was published.",
