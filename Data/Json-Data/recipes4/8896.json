The filling that you stuff the shells with makes quite a bit - I stuffed a whole box of 14 shells ( mind you they were not the large shells) to the brim and I still had about 3 cups of the filling left over.  I made a lasagna with the left over and froze it for another meal so not too bad of a problem after all :) !  My suggestion would be to scale down the filling ingredients or make sure to have more shells on hand and buy the larger shells.  Perfect recipe for company or a larger group!",
