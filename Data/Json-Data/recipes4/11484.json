(Ginger amount should say teaspoons) We than added the soy and honey mixture and the green beans.  We noticed that since we added more meat there wasn't enough liquid to simmer, so we added about another 2 tbsp of soy sauce and another tbsp of honey.  Since we adjusted these amounts, I added a few more pinches of ginger and pepper.  We served it over white rice and we absolutely loved it.  This has the perfect amount of spice, and we were thinking of other ways to make it again.  We both decided next time to try it with shredded carrots and snow peas.  Thank you so much for this recipe, we really enjoyed it and are both looking forward to the leftovers for lunch!",

I browned 1 lb of ground beef drained it then added ginger garlic & 1/2 t black pepper (1t would leave your mouth on fire) & no onion powder. Then I added 4 T. soy sauce & 3 T. honey. I stirred in frozen (thawed) green beans and the reserved onion & simmered for about 5 mins. I did not thicken since there was nothing to thicken. I served it over white rice. My husband said it needed more sauce since there wasn t any to soak up the rice & ate it but didn t rave. Next time I make this I m going to make the following changes. Increase the soy sauce to 1/3 C. & the honey to 1/4C and maybe add some sherry. I m also going to add 1/4 C shredded carrots when I add the green beans. Thanks",
