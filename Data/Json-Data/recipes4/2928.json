Some butter, carrots & some freshly grated parmesan cheese would make this taste even better.  \n\n* I do want to caution others that I used a large head of cauliflower.  I would strongly encourage others to reduce the amount of garlic if they are not garlic lovers and the salt should probably be reduced to 1 teaspoon.  You can always add more later.  I like less broth & more veggies so others may also chose to add more milk & flour if a soupier consistency is desired.  \n\nA medium sized roasting pan or 13\"x9\" pan is a better fit than the small roasting pan I noted in the recipe as it allows more room to toss.\n\nJo's Rosemary Bread compliments this meal.  (I add garlic powder & grated parmesan cheese to it.) \n\nEnjoy!\n\n            ~Jennie",

The only suggestion I have is to use a potato masher on the cauliflower after it comes out of the oven,(before you add it to your soup pot.) I used a  dry, white wine in place of the sherry and I think the head of cauliflower I had was exceptionally large, so I had to use an extra splash or two of both the milk and the chicken broth. Just use your best judgement to get the desired consistency you prefer. A very BIG thanks to Jennie for submitting this one; it's a definite keeper!!!",

It's nutty flavor is reflected in the slightly brown color.  Mildly sweet, but tempered by the garlic. Roasting the cauliflower gives this incredible flavor. I'm not a fan of nutmeg, so I left it out and didn't notice a loss. I omitted the flour as well, not seeing the need for it. Since I pureed half of the cauliflower and mashed the other half, this was plenty thick without it. The sherry adds a definite flavor dimension that makes this especially good. This cries out, however, for garnish - I reserved some of the roasted cauliflower florets and used them to top each serving along with roasted red pepper and a small sprig of parsley. Beautiful, delicious, and a nice alternative for getting your veggies!",
