I've looked through various websites in search of a similar recipe. I couldn't find a recipe for it, but did find one that has some of the same type of ingredients so I tweaked it by adding some vegetables and putting a twist on it. Here is what I came up with. This is a pretty easy recipe and tastes very good. Top with shredded cheese.",

The intentional ones; doubled the carrot/celery(to 2 carrots, 2 celery stalks)  and instead of 2c broth/2c water - used all chicken broth! The unintentional changes; I only had an 8oz jar or artichokes and misread the \u201ccooked\u201d chicken - oops! Added raw, cubed chicken during the last 15 min after I had blended + added cream elements. \n\nOverall. This is a different recipe. But we like different! And \u201cdifferent\u201d is referenced in a positive way here! Would make again! I do think onion powder or perhaps paprika could enhance but I don\u2019t cook with artichoke hearts enough to know best flavor profile matches.  In the end, we really liked and glad we made.

Since my chicken breasts were not cooked, I boiled them whole in the chicken broth-lemon juice mixture with a little salt and pepper, about 10 min. I used the full 32-oz carton of chicken broth and only 1 cup of water - needed more liquid to cover the chicken for boiling. Then removed the chicken and let cool a bit before cutting into pieces and set aside. Continued with the rest of the recipe as is. I didn\u2019t really measure but I did stick to the list of vegetables. I used Cara Mia marinated artichokes with herbs and spices - drained but not rinsed.  Omitted the wine for medical reasons.  I used immersion blender rather than handle hot soup in the blender. Added the chicken to the pot after blending for the last 5 minutes of simmer. Compliments (and seconds) all around!",
