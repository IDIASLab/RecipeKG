I also use cubed salt pork which is what my grandmother and mother always made it with. My mother used a grinder but I use a processor and the grinding blade.  After many years of making this I found the key to success is putting the ground potatoes into a sieve and squeeze as much of the liquid out before you add the flour. It is wonderful sliced and fried in butter the next day. We always serve it with a lot of butter, salt, and pepper. My grandmother called it klubb. It is good old fashioned comfort food.",

                "reviewBody": "My son made this with me for Easter Brunch.  He deceided to fry a pound of bacon and then crumble it up and mix it in the dough.  He also could find only organic red potatoes at the store.  There was almost no water that drained off them.  I have made these for over 30 years and this was the best batch I have ever had.  We called it Krub in my family too.  We make them about tennis ball size and then slightly flatten them.  They cook faster that way.  My mom made them the size of softballs and they took much longer to cook. She also used an old hand cranked grinder that we ran the potatoes and onion through, but I have found that grating works just as well.  In fact my grandmother used her food processor.  Good comfort food.\n\nI made a small batch of Krub today from russet potatoes, expecting them to release a lot of water.  It turns out the potatoes did not have water collected at the bottom of the pan after I grated them.  I wait a bit and they stayed dry.  So I added the flour a little at a time and became worried I would have to add water to the flour and ground potatoes, because the dough was dry and crumbling.  I let it sit for 5 minutes and came back and started to knead the dough and long story short,  I ended up having to add even more flour.  So making these depends a lot on your potatoes.  Usually I have to drain the excess water off.",

This is one of those dishes, we've always had this in the fall/winter and always make a big batch (in a stock pot). My parents get an uncooked salted and smoked ham (on the bone) and cook it for a couple of hours in water to make a flavorful stock to cook them in. Also depending on where in Norway you live you call this dish klubb,krub kumle or raspeballer. I'm from Bergen west coast Norway, so we call it Raspeballer. We have always used rye flour to make these, and we don't put any bacon in the middle, that is more common in the north and south part of Norway. \nCooking the klubbs, kumle etc in the stocks will make them absorbs some of the flavor from the stock. We always have rutabaga cubes or mash on the side and some of the smoked sausages you can get in Norway, here I would do a link of the Polish Kielbasa. Some eat these with some syrup, we just eat them as they are. This is also one of those dishes that taste better the next day. \nBut this is one of those fall/winter comfort foods I miss from back home. This dish and F\u00e5rik\u00e5l are the best comfortfoods when it gets cold outside.",
