I browned the meat with a half an onion chopped and added garlic powder. I used Italian seasoned diced tomatoes and substituted beef consumme for the water. It still needs more seasoning. And next time I make it I will use salad macaroni; the elbow mac \"grew\" substantially and was just too big compared to the size of the veggies. All in all it's a good recipe to adapt to your own taste.",

A big pot of it feeds a bunch and it's hearty and delicious. This recipe was great because it's the basics and you can go from there. When I make Hobo stew I literally clean my fridge adding in leftovers (like veggies even mashed potatoes can be used as thickener beans and sauce (mustard ketchup salsa...whatever you have on hand!). I learned to make this as a Brownie girl scout at a camp-out and still make it from time to time as comfort food. You can make it in your crock-pot but be careful because depending on the noodle you use it will get soggy and turn into a thick broth if you simmer too long (still tastes good but becomes thick). Anyways I love this...and it is great for pot-lucks camporees and cold winter nights. Have fun with this awesome recipe!",
