If you don't have a maid, I'd suggest starting with a large cast iron skillet, cook the meat, onion and carrot together, drain, add butter and flour to skillet to form a roux, then add the beer, bouillon, etc. and simmer 'til thickened. Top with potatoes, cheese, etc. and put under the broiler as instructed. Get the same yummy results with much less cleanup!",

It is so good that my husband and I thought it was quite possibly one of the best things we have ever tasted, and I have a very wide culinary repertoire having lived in three different countries, and I LOVE to cook! I have been making shepherds pie for 20 years but this will be the only shepherds pie recipe I ever use from now on! The only thing I changed was that I added more carrots and peas - I probably doubled them at least. It was wonderful and we couldn't stop eating it and my husband keeps asking me when I will be making it again (even though it is now 112 degrees outside, lol) Comfort food at it's BEST!",

Shepherd's pie is supposed to be lamb, (shepherd. . .sheep)  So many people use beef and call it shepherd's pie but a beef pie is a \"cottage pie\", so right away I was interested.   Kudos for using the Guinness!   The only thing I did different was to add the flour to the meat mixture and stir and cook  for a couple minutes then add the broth directly.  This is the method I use for sausage gravy, it saves a step and a pan and you never have any lumps.   This Irish girl approves darklordlarry!",

I added a minced shallot and minced garlic to the potatoes. I didn't have enough lamb, so I mixed some sausage in to make up the difference and to add a bit of saltiness to the meat. Finally, I layered the meat, then the veggies, and potatoes on top. I baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes because it had cooled a bit by the time I got it put together, and then I topped it with cheese, parsley, paprika, and put it under the broiler till the cheese bubbled. My whole family loved it, including my daughter, who likes nothing I make. The changes I made were due to personal preference, not because I felt the recipe needed changed. The beer gravy is what makes this recipe amazing, so, no matter what you do, don't change that part at all. Except, of course, if you want more gravy.  Next time, I will double the gravy and pour it over the potatoes. It's just so good!",

You can manipulate it to suit your palate and heritage. Me, I like it with celery, mushrooms, and garlic. I used 1/2 of a portabella mushroom, 1 stalk of celery, and 3 cloves of small garlic. Does it make this recipe better? I don't think so. When I made the recipe as written it was wonderful! The flavors and sauce were fantastic! Follow the recipe as it is written. If you want more or less then make the changes to suit your palate and family's  likes. This is an awesome recipe. Very easy for anyone who loves to cook. I prefer mushroom and beef base mixed together instead of the bouillon. I like a thicker sauce so I make a New Orleans roux twice the flour to the  butter. Again, the changes don't make this recipe better. The changes I made suit my tastes.",

First I only use yukon gold potatos I leave the skin on and my secret to great mashed potatoes is I boil 1 cut up celery root with the potatoes and mash together, I also ground up some roasted garlic and combined that too. when I made the roux I made and used more then the recipe called for. I made all of it in a large cast iron skillet. fantastic look no further.",
