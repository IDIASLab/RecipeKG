I sauteed onions in the olive oil  instead of using chives. I added the 2 minced garlic cloves because I love garlic. I poured chicken stock (because it's more flavorful than chicken broth) into the pan with the sauteed onions and garlic.  I then added my lemon juice, lemon pepper, garlic and onion powder and some herbs de provence.. I after bringing to a boil, I reduces the temp to low and added the cream cheese, whisking until creams.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella for the bolder flavor it gives. I placed my chicken in the bottom of my casserole dish topped with a layer of cheese next my spinach and then the creamy mixture topped with more cheese and cooked it for 30 minutes at the 375. It tasted very flavorful and was completely devoured.",

Until I realized (after taking everything out of course) that I didn't have enough cream cheese for a full or even a half recipe.  :(  So I improvised and made a roux to compensate.  It made for a very runny but good casserole.  I actually liked it a lot, despite the runniness and the cream.  I'll have to try it again when I have the correct amount of cream cheese.
