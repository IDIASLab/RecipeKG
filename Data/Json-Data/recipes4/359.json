I prefer more seasoning, so I added crushed red pepper and black pepper, also a little onion powder. I will experiment more in the future with additional cheeses. This is a keeper!\n\nUpdate 10/08: I have made this recipe countless times since my first review, the folks at work absolutely loved it everytime. It didn't last 10 minutes once I hit the door. I use Hot sausage and add a bit of red pepper flakes, I've even done a version with cheese. Always tastes great. So many options you can do.\nGreat recipe!!",

They would be specially for a brunch or super bowl-type event.  \n\nNow I make these with 2 tblsp onion and 1 tblsp garlic added while cooking the sausage (you could add other veggies like diced green pepper, mushrooms...), then mix with 1 pkg lite cream cheese, 1 beaten egg and 1/2 cup stove top mix (I like the Savory Herbs variety).  After covering the bottom of the cups with red. fat crescent rolls, spoon a 1-2 inch scoop of sausage/cheese mixture on top, then bake 12 minutes (don't forget the cooking spray!).  You can try different kinds of sausage or flavored cream cheese for different spins as well.  I usually use the reduced fat sausage as well, and I'm sure it would work with ground turkey sausage.  I love these so will try the actual rolls as the recipe describes soon - I know the taste is great but will be curious to try it in a different format!\n\nThanks for the great recipe!",

Put all mix on top. Add second can of cresent rolls pinch seams and sides. Bake for time on roll can. May need extra 3-4 min. Much faster and easier than individual triangles.",

I can usually get about 12-13 slices out of the roll.  Lay them flat on a grease cookie sheet and cook at 350 for about 15-18 minutes.  They come out as perfect sausage rolls.  Mmmmm!",
