I have no idea what a tsimmes is but holy hannah it's sweet. Like sweeter then anything I have ever made for desert. I have looked at a few other recipes for tsimmes and it seems like they are all very sweet so maybe that is what it is supposed to be like? Either way it was good. I used 3 large sweet potatoes instead of 4 and it was still a LOT OF SWEET POTATOES! It filled my crock pot as full as it has ever been. I would use only 2 next time. I would also leave out the honey. Those prunes and the sweet potato are so sweet already you don't need the honey! The cloves were delicious and the ribs turned out to DIE for. Unfortunately due to the sweetness we will likely just pick out the meat and not enjoy the stew. Thank you for such an interesting recipe!",
