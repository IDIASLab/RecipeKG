I already had cooked leftover chicken and was using freshly cooked beans so I skipped the crockpot method and went stove top instead. Followed the recipe exactly in every other way and wouldn't change anything. I used home made mango salsa- 'Nicole's Mango Salsa' from this site. This recipe is not spicy hot though so add in jalapeno's if you like it hot. Shredded Monterey Jack cheese tortilla chips green onions and sour cream to top finished it perfectly. Well done on your very original recipe Mary. Thank you!",
