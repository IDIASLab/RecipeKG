We made a roast beef dinner and I usually make a horseradish sauce with sour cream and mayonnaise but this time I wanted something that would stand up more firmly to a leftover roast beef sandwich. This was so yummy! I can see this being a staple in my fridge - not only was it delicious with our original meal (especially melted into mashed potatoes) but it's a great spread for sandwiches or crackers or veggie dip. Only change was to add a bit of chopped fresh parsley for color and I may have added more horseradish. Yum!",
