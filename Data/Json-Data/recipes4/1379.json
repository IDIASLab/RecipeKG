I'd like to start off by saying that I am not a calorie-counter--  never, ever actually, but happened to see the calorie count in the nutrition info and was shocked at the calories and fat in this dish!  852 calories and 64.8 gms of fat in one serving! Holey Moley!  I made some substitutions for taste and to lower the cal/fat.  I parboiled my potatoes, but I won't bother next time.  An hour in the oven will be fine as long as you slice them relatively thin (1/8 inch).  I added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce and some chopped banana peppers (with the extra juice squeezed out) to the ground beef.  For the sauce I substituted 1.5 cups of 2% milk and 1.5 cups of light chicken stock for the 3 cups of milk.  Instead of a cup of heavy cream I used 1/2 cup of sour cream that I had on hand.  I was going to add a full cup but the sauce was rich enough with only 1/2 cup .  These substitutions cut the fat and calories by half!  I also added an additional 1 tbl. of flour to the roux because some other reviewers complained of runniness.  I browned-up the roux to  make the sauce a little more robust.  Be sure to keep the flame low and keep stirring.  \n\nI used 2 cups of cheese instead of 4, which seemed like overkill:  I used 1 cup of a jack, cheddar, asadero blend and 1 cup of shredded mozz.\n\nI cooked it for an hour in a large cast-iron skillet and it was perfectly done: crisp and bro",

(brought them to a boil turned them off and covered them for ten minutes then I bathed them in cold water till I was ready to slice them) The result was a slightly under cooked potato that finished off nicely in the casserole. It turned out great. The next day I put the left overs in an augratin dish over a bed of frozen peas. I added a tbls of heavy cream to the peas and topped it all with a little more cheese. Again great result.",

First instead of cooking the onions which I didn't have I started right with cooking the ground beef. I seasoned extra lean ground beef with plenty of onion powder and garlic powder some Adobo seasoning steak seasoning garlic salt 1/2 small can of chopped green chilies (suggested by reviewers from New Mexico) and black pepper. I then added a scoop of sour cream to the cooled meat and about 1TB. of Worcestershire sauce. Next for the Au Gratin potato portion I made the roux like directed (no problems here for me) and then mixed in about 2 tsp. of chicken bouillon and about 2 cups of 1% milk. When this mixture thickened up I turned off the heat and added 2 cups of grated sharp cheddar cheese the rest of the can of chopped green chilies another 1 TB. of Worcestershire sauce and about 1/2C. of sour cream. To the sauce I added my thin cut potato slices (I used 3 large red potatoes that I had boiled until tender then peeled and sliced). Lastly I layered my potato mixture with ground beef in a buttered baking dish (potatoes beef potatoes beef ending with potatoes). I baked dish covered at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. And then uncovered dish added some green onions (chives) to the top and cooked for an additional 10 minutes. For the last 5 minutes I broiled the dish in order to get a bubbly and toasty top. My husband loved the dish!!",
