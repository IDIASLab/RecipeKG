I used dijon mustard and I added a teaspoon each of dried basil and dried oregano. I did NOT add the extra salt as there was plenty in the beef broth I used. I served this with buttered egg noodles and roasted broccoli. Everyone loved it. There's just enough for someone to re-warm for lunch tomorrow. Very good.",

It's worth the extra $$ for special occasions. I didn't happen to have wine on hand, and substituted red wine vinegar for the marinade, and it added a nice tang to the roux. If you're not fond of spicier flavors, it's fine to omit the red pepper. This is gourmet eating--remember to leave a tip for the cook!",

As other reviewers mentioned, I subbed dijon for yellow mustard. Instead of red pepper flakes, I used a pinch of ground cayenne. Also, this recipe can be completed with a slow cooker for 4-5 hours on low;  add the sauteed mushrooms a half hour before the end of cooking time. I found that the gravy was a little thin in the slow cooker, so added some corn starch just before serving. You will love this recipe!  The sour cream and cream cheese add the depth of flavor that makes this stroganoff \"rich and creamy.\"  Thanks, sanfrancook.",

I made the following variations since I do NOT like tough or chewey meat & didn't want to take a chance so I did this portion of the recipe using a slow cooker.... I used a beef round roast that I sliced 1/2\" thick slices; (I used an inexpensive red wine -Terrenal Cabernet Sauvignon - from trader joe's) marinated pat dry sear each side in olive oil then immediately put into slow cooker saute onions & garlic in butter olive oil splash of wine pinch of salt.. added to slow cooker along with remaining marinade & all the other liquids & seasonings listed... let cook 3 hours on high. When done use all broth from slow cooker when following directions for \"Steps #3...\"... the sauce was creamy & so tastey. Personally I feel the cream cheese & sour cream are optional when using a slow cooker for beef. Tip: for noodles try this recipe: Grandma's Butter Noodles by Momofaddy. Delicious!!",
