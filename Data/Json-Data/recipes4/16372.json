A winner for me, my husband, and 1 year old. Quick, easy, and healthy. Have plenty for the week.",

Easy to spice it up with some onions garlic hot sauce sharp cheese etc when intended for an adult palate but as it stands this is great for kiddos (and less adventurous adults). One change I made was to use baby quinoa (kaniwa) which lacks the saponins and thus is not subject to the bitterness of quinoa. I really like how they turned out and will be packing them in my daughter's lunchbox as well as feeding them to my 1 yr old twins! Many thanks!",
