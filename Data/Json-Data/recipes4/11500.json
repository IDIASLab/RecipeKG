First time making lentils and i now like lentils:) This needed a little more seasoning for my taste so I added 3 cloves garlic and used a whole seeded jalapeno 1 full tsp cumin dashes of celery salt 1 can fat free chicken broth instead of water and a pinch of mexican oregano. More fresh basil would be excellent in this. I have a tomato garden in bloom so I used 4 medium fresh tomatoes instead of canned. This is a hearty soup and excellent with the recommended sour cream and basil garnishes. Thank You!!!",
