Made in a pressure cooker, it takes approximately 20 minutes for a full, hearty meal. This soup also freezes beautifully.",

Plus having a soup simmering in the kitchen in the winter--sending its fragrance thru the house is a huge plus. The package of sausage (sweet italian) I bought had 5 in it...the package of chicken had 3...so I kinda scaled up from there. I sued the same ammt of barley and lentils. Also the same ammt of stock. I also used a cube of Mexican chicken/tomatoe boullion and that gave the stock a richer flavor. I simmered everything together for about 3.5 hours and everyone at the house said it smelled \"heavenly\" (my 14 year old) Next time I will leave out the barley--I dont think it contributes anything to the soup. I will also leave out the spinach--it was kinda slimey. Some carrots in the next batch and a bean mixture instead of the 'banzos. The stock was delicious and it is a definate base for experimentation. With potatoes I think it will be very similar to the zuppa Toscana soup at the big olive chain restaurant.",

I was unsure about the barley and lentils - I added them dry from a package and it turned out beautiful, not mushy.  The only change I made was frozen spinach - worked great - also I did not add the green salsa till I served it and it was a really nice garnish.  Looks beautiful, and tastes really great!  Also, I made my own chicken stock in the pressure cooker about 15 minutes prior to making soup - this makes such a nice soup base, better than any store bought!",

I also added one can of diced tomatoes with no salt added and with garlic, oregano and basil.   Since the recipe as is is very high in sodium per serving, I boiled the lentils and the garbanzo beans myself in water with no salt. I added one cube of chicken bouillon and it turned out perfect and even healthier. The barley helps to reduce cholesterol and by boiling the beans myself, it was low in sodium too. Perfect!  Also, one tip: don't add the parsley until you are ready to turn off the heat. Parsley is a great antioxidant; however, if you boil it, it loses all properties. The same for the spinach.",

Also I was lazy and rather than saut\u00e9ing anything I sliced the sausage and threw all of the ingredients into the slow cooker. I used fresh garbanzos that I had soaked for about four hours. I cooked on low for 6 hours. Chopped up the spinach in the food processor and added it and cooked another hour. Very satisfying.",

Tasty even with a few substitutions because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand (red lentils for green cannelini for chick peas Italian petite diced tomatoes for salsa). Since I like to make a LOT of soup if I'm going to go to the trouble I added a lot more chicken and water. Figuring it might need a little spice I added some extra Italian seasoning (Penzeys Tuscan Sunset) and I found a jar of chili paste in the cupboard and used only about 1/2 tsp for the 12 cups of water I used with Better Than Turkey bouillon (out of chicken). Still very tasty. Wish I'd had a little more spinach than I'd had on hand but it looks beautiful just the same.",
