There were a few veggies leftover so I just sprinkled them on the top of the quesadillas as they \"looked\" quite dull. I fried the veggies in oil and added garlic powder. I think next time I might add some cilantro - although this recipe is very good it just needs a little something extra a spice of some kind perhaps. The recipe states for you to be careful when turning - I had a hard time turning them without the veggies coming out so plan ahead on how you're going to turn them!:)",

I serve with salsa. Sometimes I add some cooked meat like ground turkey or chicken. Here's the trick to turning them neatly. Warm the tortilla for a few seconds in the microwave to make it pliable lay it on the foil and only put the filling on HALF of the tortilla. Fold the tortilla over the filling and flip it over so it doesn't keep opening broil until brown flip it over and broil the other side. Easy peasy.",

I also use the Mrs Dash garlic and onion blend to season the veggies. I cook the frozen veggies and zucchini first then add mushrooms and seasoning. The best cheese to use for this is called quesadilla cheese. It's got great flavor and melts well. Even the kids love these.",

                "reviewBody": "As others mentioned it needs \"something\". Whether it be garlic salsa lemon salt - it just needs something otherwise it's incredibly bland. I tried adding ranch dressing but didn't add a lot and so couldn't really taste it. I also doused it in cheese and couldn't really taste that either. I made it without onions or mushrooms and still had a ton of vegetables to try to fit into the tortillas. I managed to make it all fit but if I had done onions and mushrooms - it never would have fit. I also noticed a lot of people did not add the carrots but I did and think they were necessary to give it a slight variety in taste. They steamed just fine and were well done (I steamed for 4 minutes). A lot of people said turning over was hard but didn't give any suggestions for how to turn over. So I took two plates and put them on top of the tortillas then flipped the baking sheet and plates and was able to get the tortillas moved back onto the baking sheet with little issue. Flipping over any other way was nearly impossible (I tried!). These were incredibly filling and both my husband and I agreed that one quesadilla split in half would have been perfect for two of us. You can always make a small side if wanted like rice or beans. I think next time we're going to try garlic and add some chicken or steak to his and my chicken-free chicken to mine. Oh and watch the tortillas carefully as they burn quickly. I broiled for 3 minutes each side and that was perfect.",
