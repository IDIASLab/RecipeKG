The only things I did differently was to add about 1/3 of a cup of chopped onions with the other vegetables and some shredded cheddar cheese to the sauce before mixing into the pasta. Even though my DH was looking for some meat he still took two big helpings. He suggested that the next time I make this I should add some cubed ham. I will definitely make this again with or without the ham!",

Instead of yellow squash used two medium zucchini and 8 oz. container of mushrooms and a red and yellow pepper. Didn't have grape tomatoes so used 5 ripe roma tomatoes(think they were better) Didn't have basil and did not miss it. Baked it a little longer as I used a 10 x l5 dish. Loved the crunchy topping. Good recipe for vegetarians and for anyone who loves vegetables.",

We have used combinations bell peppers asparagus broccoli yellow squash zucchini. carrots brussel sprouts snap peas green peas eggplant baby spinach oyster mushrooms and grape tomatoes.
