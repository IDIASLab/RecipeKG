One of the recurring themes in this movie was Goldie Hawn's character's ability to cook an amazing dish called Chicken Pepperoni. I had never heard of Chicken Pepperoni before, but I thought it sounded delicious. So I decided to put some ingredients together and gave it the ol' college try. It came out delicious!",

This resulted in much thinner chicken breast\u2019s.  I let that sit in the refrigerator for about 4 hours.   I used pasta sauce from the store, but added some additional seasoning - minced garlic cloves, oregano and fresh parsley.   Once ready to cook, it took less time cook on each side since the breasts were thinner - maybe 3 minutes per side.   Instead of shredded mozzarella, I used mozzarella slices (2 per breast).  I served it with pasta and green beansMy husband was delighted - and he is new to the world of Italian cuisine.  This will become a permanent part of our dinner rotation.",
