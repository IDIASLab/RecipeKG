I have a couple of time saving tips: Cut the stem off of the jalapeno and scoop out the seeds and membrane with the tip of your potato peeler. Rather than cubing the cheese cut it into rectangles and just slip it in from the end that you cut the stem from. For the reviewer who wanted more zip: toss the balls into Shake and Bake for Pork the hot and spicy type. That ups the heat without hiding the flavor.",

My jalapenos were large and I had no idea how this was supposed to look so I was only able to make 9 \"eggs\". That's a pretty far cry from the 24 that the recipe said it would make. I loved the spice in these - it was perfect for us. I did add some cream cheese to the stuffing of the peppers which was yummy. I also had to add one egg to the \"breading\" in order to make it sticky and hold together around the peppers. I would grab a handful of the sausage/breading mixture and then flatten it in my hand (like a hamburger patty but VERY thin) and then put the jalapeno in the middle and roll the patty around the pepper. It would then take a little smooshing to make it perfectly fit around but I think this method seemed to work well. All together a very good recipe. I have included a few before and after pics so others can see what it looked like for me.",
