(Doubt they will \u201csurvive\u201d with my husband around! :o) ) Great recipe. I will serve it at my upcoming Martini Party! UPDATE: I made them again and I mixed almonds instead of pecans (I confused them...don\u2019t ask me why :(  ) and they are not bad...but definitely they are much better with pecans",
