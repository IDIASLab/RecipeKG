As I suspected the soup turned orange from the carrot (almost looks like butternut squash) but it adds great flavor. Cauliflower doesn't really have a lot of flavor but this soup is anything but bland. I used my immersion blender and the soup was very thick so I did have to thin out with a little chicken broth and water. You'll have to adjust the consistency to your preference which is certainly not meant as a negative. Thanks newmommy for a nice new soup recipe.",
