We agreed by far these were some of the best we've ever had!! it was perfect because I ran out of sugar & milk- so the recipe was exactly what I needed!  Also: after I put the biscuits on the cookie sheet to bake, I spread some melted \"Smart Balance\" butter on the tops of them with a pastry brush, and they turned out really goldeny brown- and had a rich outer flavor!! \n&& just like everyone said, they ARE very sticky when you shape them, so use lots of flour on your hands!!  BUt again, fabulous recipe!!!",

I use 1/4 cup 0f buttermilk instead of the water. Also baked on a grid. Brushed tops of bicuits with butter before baking. Baking time will need to be increased by about 4 to 5 minutes. Will use instead of my yeast biscuit recipe that I have used for many years.",
