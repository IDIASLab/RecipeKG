This time because I love garlic, I used 1 head of cauliflower and 1 head of brocolli and about 12 cloves chopped the garlic and stored it in 2 tbls of olive oil ill ready.  While the garlic was marinating, I chopped the vegetables.  Added 2 tbls of melted butter with the garlic mixture to the veggies and tossed with salt and pepper.  It was GREAT!!  Oh, it only needed 30 mins, added some grated parm and broiled for 2 min..yum! Yum!",

If you season it up with some spices, I think it could be a 4-5 star recipe. As written, it is simply too plain. I usually add garlic, onion and then either basil or thyme when I roast veggies. I missed not having the extra flavors. I think next time I will put crushed garlic in the butter and heat it on low for awhile before brushing it on the cauliflower. Cooking time was spot on!! Worth a try with adjustments you think would appeal to you.",
