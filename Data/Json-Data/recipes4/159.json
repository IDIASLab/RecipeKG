The peanut butter mix (w/o the chocolate) tastes like \"buckeyes\" that one makes at Christmas time.  GREAT!! Will make it again and again. To the comment from Lara29: make sure you are using powdered (not regular!)sugar (4 1/2 cups is one box) because the amount is just perfect.  Wouldn't change a thing :)",

As we continued to devour the cookie sheet worth of candy we discovered that a little sprinkle of salt helped do the trick to improve what it was lacking. We think that perhaps eliminating the margerine in the chocolate topping would enhance the chocolate flavor and reduce the richness of the dessert - more like cracker candy. Make sure you have plenty of water or other non-sweetened beverage available! Lastly I would give the texture of the peanut butter bottom 5 stars! It definitely had that Reeses' Peanut Buttercup feel.",
