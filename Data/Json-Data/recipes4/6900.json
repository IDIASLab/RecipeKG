Made a few revisions to make the dish a bit healthier: used cottage cheese instead  of ricotta and added frozen chopped spinach to have a vegetable involved. I didn't squeeze the moisture out of the cottage cheese, just tossed it in. I did drain the spinach though. Rather then 3-4 hours I let the mixture sit over night, made the shells the next day for lunch. Used texans buffalo sauce and cut the butter in half. My husband says it's a top 10. This is certainly a keeper and the cottage cheese substitution saves hundreds of calories. Avoids that \"brick-like\" feeling from very rich foods.",

These were easy to make, though I did have more shells than filling, so I'd rec boiling 1/2 a box of shells.  Despite using regular \"Frank's (R)\", these were a bit too warm for Mr. LTH, but I found the heat to be quite mild.  I wasn't a big fan of the chicken chunks (but I don't really love chicken, anyway), so I think I'd prefer them w/shredded chicken (BLSL).  I agree w/the submitter that these would make a nice party appetizer!  I was concerned about the lack of a sauce and that the shells would harden/turn rubbery, but I worried for naught!

Shredded boneless skinless breast will be a good alternative for next time. The filling made enough for the entire box of shells and I used the Frank's buttery wing sauce as it's closer to actual \"wing flavoring\". I was concerned the shells would be crunchy without sauce coverage so I brushed a touch of the sauce of the edges of each shell. I see in other reviews it wasn't necessary but we like spicier food so the additional sauce was welcome! I used Mozzarella as I was out of the Monterey Jack; I suppose any cheese would suffice depending on your preference. Overall a good recipe to make again.",
