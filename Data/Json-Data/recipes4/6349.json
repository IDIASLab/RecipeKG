Once as directed, then I cut it into bite sized pieces, and lowered the heat to 350 and let it cook again while the meatballs cooked (about 15-20 minutes).  I also only used one jar of sauce (trust me, it's plenty of sauce still).  Then I added an extra cup of cheese to the meatballs and sauce, stirred that in, poured the sauce over the bread bites, topped with the 2 cups of cheese and finished as directed.   Let sit 5 min, and *boom* instant family favorite.",

I added more flavor by making homemade meatballs and sauce and I mixed up some mozzarella cheese with some garlic herb spread and spread that on the bread (I used a baguette from the bakery-not the frozen bread). Baked it until the cheese was bubbly and then I topped that with the meatballs and the sauce and some more mozzarella along with a little bit of italian bread crumbs and then baked until the cheese melted. It was really quick, easy and delicious! Thanks!",
