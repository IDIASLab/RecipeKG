Next time I will use 1.5 to 2 cups of chicken broth and omit the butter all together.  Its not necessary.  The flavor of the cauliflower and cheese combination makes this taste a lot like mashed potatoes.  You could probably trick the kids for sure.  I will definitely make again with these changes.\nNOTE** Ok, I think I figured it out.  I used about 1.5c chicken broth, simmered for 15 mins, added 1/3c sour cream, 1c parmesean cheese and 2tbsp butter.  I mixed with my hand mixer until I had a blended but slightly chunky (like country smashed potatoes) texture.  LOVE IT>",

When it was done I drained the broth into a bowl. Then used my wand blender and added a little broth at a time until I had the thickness I wanted. To get the \"mashed potato\" consistency I added a couple tablespoons of heavy cream. You could use half & half but I didn't have any. Of course this adds cals and fat but gives a wonderful consistency! To cut down on the cheese I used crumbled gorgonzola (about 3 T) instead of the cheddar and parm. Fabulous if you like that taste!",

It was pretty difficult to mash the cauliflower so I plopped it all in the food processor to smooth it out although the texture was still a bit grainy. Also there is a ton of liquid. I drained as other reviewers did but added about a tablespoon of broth back in. I did use the amount of butter called for but didn't add any salt and used less cheese. I also subbed feta for the cheddar and added roasted garlic. With all these changes it was good. Otherwise would have been very runny. Thanks for sharing.",
