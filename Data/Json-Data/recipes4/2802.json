As for the reviewers who think they might use butter for this?  The reason you shouldn't is that oil has a much higher resistence to burning in high heat (close to the broiler) than olive oil does.  If you really want butter on your meat then melt some after and pour it on.  If you cook with it, the meat will tend to burn on the outside.",
