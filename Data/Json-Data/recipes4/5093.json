This is the actual recipe from my husband's great-grandmother.  I cut it down by a third for my family of 4.  But I have given you the full recipe so you can cut it however you would like. There is a family 'secret ingredient' that I have never been told and so it's not in this recipe :(  I believe it will still be yummy without the 'secret,' but if you happen to know what that is, then add it in ;)",

                "reviewBody": "I gave this recipe 1 star for the following reasons..... \n1. The season salt. 3 TBS is a ton of salt in the first place and real PA Dutch filling doesn't have season salt in it. Just salt and pepper. \n2. The fact that the bread is just to be added soft into the potatoes as they are in the mixing stage. This is very odd. The bread should be cubed and browned in more butter then added after the potatoes have already been mashed. \n3. The lack of eggs\n4. The crazy amount of butter on top. The top should be dotted with a TBS or 2 of butter but 1/2 cup is way to much. The majority of butter should be in the dish not on it. You are already cooking the celery onions and bread in butter not to mention making the mashed potatoes with butter. \n5. The veggies should be softened but not browned. \n6. This should be made the day before to allow the flavors to really meld together\n7. This dish should NOT be covered while baking. When putting the filling in the dish do not smooth the top down all the little peeks and the top will get a yummy brown top. \nAnd last but not least even more season salt on top.",
