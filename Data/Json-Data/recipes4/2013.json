I used 2 packs of veal scallopine (about 8 pieces) egged breaded and fried them. Transfered them to a baking dish and layered them with procuitto and provolone cheese. I made the wine sauce with one whole pack of white button mushrooms sliced and used beef broth instead of the chicken broth....thickened it slightly with cornstarch. I placed a small amount of sauce upon each piece of provolone(which was ontop of the veal) and covered the pan with foil and baked for about 15-20 min. on 300 degrees until the cheese was melty and bubbly. Served with more of the mushroom wine sauce on top. The veal was so tender and delicious! Hubby loved it. This is a true keeper. It tasted like I went out to eat at some fancy restaurant!",

First I decided to layer the provolone prosciutto and asparagus instead of making pockets and baked to melt the cheese. I sauteed the mushrooms with the onions and roasted peppers not separately. I made the sauce as directed then I added 1/2 cup marsala wine with some cornstarch to thicken.I added some butter at the end to glaze the sauce. I then poured over the cutlets and served. Do NOT salt the sauce as the proscuitto is salty enough. Delicious!",
