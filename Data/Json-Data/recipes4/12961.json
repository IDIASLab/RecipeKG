I used Polish beef sausage instead of chorizo (to make it kosher). I added 1 carrot chopped into small pieces plus its carrot greens finely diced for color. I used 4 tsp of salt instead of 2 tsp of salt because I like it more heavily seasoned. I used plain paprika instead of smoked paprika only because I didn't have the smoked kind. Thanks for a great recipe!!",

It seems a good recipe but the best substitute (what can easily be found in american grocery stores) is collard greens.

And when my Avo (grandma) cant get chourico or linguica sausage she uses mild italian sausage. Its a bit strong but still good.",
