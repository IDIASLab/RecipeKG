Delicate coconut, with a nice zing on the lips from the chilli pepper flakes. \nI whipped up this recipe for two in 45 minutes.\n\nI substituted the cumin seeds with a 1/2 tsp. of cumin powder. I added half the chopped onions and half minced garlic in with it to give more flavour to the chicken. I cooked the chicken most of the way before adding the oil and veggies (tip: along with the carrots, I added broccoli crowns. It holds in the flavours really well!) \n\nFor the spices I skipped the cinnamon, added an extra dash of pepper flakes, and upped the curry powder to  2 tsp. I also substituted the salt with lemon pepper then poured in the coconut milk right away so the flavours could blend as it simmered. \n\n5 stars, I couldn't believe how easy it was. Next time, I'll try fresh coriander/ cilantro garnish.\nYummy!",
