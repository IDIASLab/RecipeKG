I was so excited that I found a recipe that lookes and tastes just like regular chili but without the tomatoes.  I made the recipe as described but with green enchilada sauce for the chile sauce. The chili was so delicious, and tomato fans cant tell the difference. This was perfect and I will be saving this recipe for monthly use! Thank you!",

However my daughter really dislikes chunky tomatoes in her chili.  I usually puree them in my version.  This was the main reason for trying this chili.  SO GLAD I DID!!  This will be my \"other\" choice on occasion.  The CHILI SAUCE, beef broth and worcheshire sauce make this so special.  I only had 2 1/4 pounds of beef so I basically cut back slightly on all the other ingredients.  However for the chili powder I started with 2 TBLS, tasted after 20 minutes and added another TBLS.  My daughter can't eat it too spicy.  After she had 2 helpings and LOVED it, I added 1 MORE TBLS. of chili powder (4 total).  The flavor was so smooth with the heat slightly at the end of the bite.  I was pleasantly surprised how really good this chili was!",
