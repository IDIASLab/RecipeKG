Cooked for 15 minutes on each side at 350F covered, then 20-30 minutes uncovered at 400F so the skin would get nice and crispy. Every time I opened the oven I placed a little more sauce on the chicken. The room smelt nice and orangey and the chicken came out tasting great. Will be making again soon.",

I substituted 1 tbsp. fresh sage for rubbed and green onion tops for chives because that is what was handy. I salted and peppered the chicken before printing and checking the recipe learning that it called for garlic salt. So I added a crushed garlic clove to the glaze. The chicken was heavenly and I dipped every bite in glaze! Wow. Next time I may need more glaze.:o) My husband is crazy for ginger so I may try ginger marmalade some time. Thanks again.",

A hint for those who don't know much about Balsamic Vinegar...depending on how old and how long it is aged for will change the flavour of the vinegar. The old and longer aged ones cost more and will have a VERY pungent flavour. Please adjust your recipe or you will be disappointed by the overwhelming Balsamic aroma and taste. If you are in doubt add less the first time.",

The result was a moist tender grilled chicken with a nice sweet orange flavor. Thanks KitchenKing!",
