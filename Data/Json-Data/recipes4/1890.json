I made some minor changes to the recipe; I sprinkle the brisket with salt, black pepper & parsley flakes.  I only use organic ketchup or any ketchup that DOES NOT have corn syrup in it.  I have nothing against corn syrup, I've just found that the brisket has a better flavor when I use the ketchup without it.  I also use Vernor's ginger soda as I've found this brand to add the best flavor without being overly sweet.  Sometimes I leave the carrots out & it's still great.  I cook in my convection roasting oven at 375 degrees for the recommended time.  I then take the brisket out of the oven & let it rest for 15-20 minutes.  Then, I slice it & put it along with the sauce in a large crock pot on low until I'm ready to serve.  It's crazy but every single person that has eaten the brisket prepared this way says it's the best they've ever had & we're talking more than 60 people!!!",

The taste was not bad, just too sweet for my family as we don't like meat to have a sweet taste. I guess I thought the soup mix would counter the sweet factor but it didn't. The brisket did turn out very tender and sliced perfectly. I rinsed the carrots off because they were coated with the sweet syrupy sauce! Didn't serve the sauce with the meat, but heated bottled bbq sauce instead. Thanks anyway.",

Always in search of that depth of flavor that makes the dish really come alive. \n\n\"Grandma's Brisket\"  is, how can I say this? Fantastic. Buttery smooth. Melt in your mouth. Delicious. You don't even have to chew.  \n\nAnd who would want to? If you chew that means you have to swallow. That means the taste is gone and you have to eat....more. \n\nIt's almost indescribable. It's that good. \n\nThe only change I made, was to use a cooking bag for the first two hours and cut it open for the last hour. \n\nThe beef melts in your mouth. Soft. Chewy. \n\nThe carrots, infused with the beefy, onion, tomato flavor, are a meal unto themselves. They're that good. \n\nThe wet works, left over in the bottom of the pan, are liquid gold. There is no other way to describe it.  Spoon them over the sliced meat and this is....perfect.",
