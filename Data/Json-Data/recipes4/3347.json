I saw this and Emailed it to my friend, as a joke. He routinely takes our brewpub meals, cuts the perfect plate presentation into small bites, & mixes everything with ketchup before eating it with a fork. I always make fun of him, and thought he would appreciate the joke. FAST FORWARD TO LAST NIGHT: To my shock, he prepared it as part of a Saturday barbecue. We giggled, drank beer, finished cooking the \"real\" food and sat down to eat. Result? Hands down, the hit of the barbecue with adults and kids alike. Obviously, it won't replace a main entree, but it's a super simple and shockingly great side dish. Use extra bologna, almost double.",

It should have either more bologna added as 8 didn't cover the 9x13 pan so everyone would receive some meat or reduce the potatoes to 3. I would still use an 8x8 pan as the layer was really thin with 9x13. I will not make this again, although I like fried bologna and mashed potatoes, as I didn\u2019t think it made a nice presentation or was all that flavorful.
