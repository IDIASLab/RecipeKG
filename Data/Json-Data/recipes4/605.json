I added some seasonings to mine to give it some flavor and I also made 4 chops as 2 would not feed our family of 6. They were awesome! I went to spear them with a fork to put them on a serving plate and the meat was just falling apart it was so tender. Only 1 of our 4 children didn't like them and my husband and I loved them. I made the recipe as written but added onion salt curry powder and dried thyme leaves to the meat. Also I sliced the onions as opposed to chopping for texture. I served the meat with a mixture of snap peas baby carrots and white corn and potato wedges with dill weed salt and butter. It was a great meal to come home to and I was amazed to see my 2-year old have 3 helpings of this dish. The next time I make this I will experiment with different kinds of beer. I used Icehouse but would like to try a Guiness the next time.",
