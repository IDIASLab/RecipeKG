Used shredded sharp cheddar instead of the velveeta. Loved the green chilis they add just the right taste. The only other thing I did differently was I did not include the salsa inside the burrito but added it as we were eating them. Next time I might used pepper jack cheese or add just a few jalapenos for a little kick. Also might use a hotter salsa I just used mild this time for those in my household that dont like very spicy foods.These get 2 thumbs up!!",

The difference - I smoke the 1 lb. chubs of sausage (known as a \"fatty\" in the smoking world) until done then chop them. The smoke flavor really adds. And another addition that makes them KILLER is Tabasco Sweet & Spicy which you have to order on-line from the Tabasco site.
