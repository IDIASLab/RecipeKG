I added some cubed chicken a clove of crushed garlic and a can of water chestnuts for extra flavor. I only used 1 flavor packet from the rice and used reduced sodium soup to cut down on salt. Any more and it would have been salty! Make sure to stir it up periodically otherwise the rice on top won't soak enough liquid and it will be a little crunchy. I cooked mine on low for 7 hours and it was done properly but there was a burned layer on the bottom of the crock pot. Thanks for a great recipe!",

If your family doesn't mind having the same side dish two days in a row make it with servings as given otherwise cut recipe in half. I agree that sliced water chestnuts would be a nice addition if you like texture variety. I think I will keep several boxes of the instant rice mix handy in my pantry now. Almost forgot it did take a bit longer for the rice to cook completely than recipe said so you might want to test out cooking time in your slowcooker before serving it for a specifically timed dinner.",

Here's a new twist...I had quite a bit left over so put whole crock into fridge next day I added 2 cartons of Campbell's chicken stock and a bit of leftover turkey- slowcooked for about 3 hrs on high and got RAVE reviews on the soup! Next time I will purposely make too much so we can have the soup again. Try it you won't be dissappointed!",
