We had sausage left over from our trip to our favorite barbecue place last night so that took the place of both the sausage and the hog jowl. After reading the reviews I used a teaspoon of garlic pepper; it could have used 2 tsp. But otherwise was very tasty. We didn't use the rice or cheese. The directions on the frozen black eyed peas said to boil for 3 mins and simmer for 40 to 45 mins. They were perfectly cooked at that time.",
