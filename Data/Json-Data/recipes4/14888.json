Spices like cumin and paprika need to be fried in the olive oil to develop full flavour. So I did that and added garlic in at the last and fried 30 seconds. Added oil mix to lemon juice and added cilantro. Put al dente carrots in warm from the pot, draining the water first. Salad needs to marinate a few hours at room temp to develop full flavour. Will add some onion to dressing next time, about 3T minced onion  will go in with the garlic to the dressing.",

I thought maybe with the cayenne and paprika that these might be too spicy, but they came out perfect. And while it takes a little while for the carrots to cook, it is so easy because a lot of the time is just waiting, and you can do other things during that time. My whole family loved these carrots so I know I will be making them again sometime soon. Thanks for the recipe, Malak!",

First, I only had balsamic vinegar, which made the appearance darker than illustrated. Next, I accidentally dumped the vinegar in the mixture at the beginning of cooking instead of at the end.  Third, I found I didn't have ground cumin, only the seeds.  I tried to grind them in my mortar/pestle but it didn't work.  I decided to throw them in the cooking mixture as well.  It did take a lot longer than 20 minutes for the carrots to get tender and the liquid to evaporate, but I thought keeping all the ingredients was important so I kept cooking till the liquid was nearly gone - got to a syrupy consistency before the end.  All in all it was tasty, now I have to go back to the Moroccan restaurant and try the original to compare tastes.",
