The garlic green onion and tofu are a winning combo...I have to admit that I changed the spices and used curry powder (about 2 Tbsps.) and a pinch of cayenne instead of the oregano and paprika but I think this recipe is versatile and could be changed to incorporate your spices of preference. I also omitted the flour and the sauce seemed thick enough without it. The Greek yogurt worked really well and the barley was also good. Thanks for the great recipe! Next time I will try making it as written.",

I even substituted vegetable broth for water to add flavor to the barley and this just tastes like...barley...yogurt...and tofu. I would probably double the scallions and put them in with the barley when it's boiling or something to try and add more flavor. I'm eating it right now and it's actually pretty gross.",
