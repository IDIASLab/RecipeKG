I cooked it according to the instructions; however I found the cabbage step to be cumbersome. Next time I would add the cabbage to the skillet of cooked carrots and onions. The Balsamic vinegar in the water did not do much for the flavor although I found I could taste a hint of it in leftovers the next day. For a more prominent vinegar flavor I would add it to the skillet. I did not salt the potato water and was concerned about flavor; however the garlic salt added at the end provided plenty of flavor enhancement. For potatoes I used Yukon Gold and left the skin on which provided good texture and taste. I left the mashed potatoes a bit lumpy because that is how i like them. I served the kolcannon with bacon bits which I may add in next time. This recipe requires several pans and cooking utensils so be prepared for cleanup afterwards. Overall I like the flavors in the recipe-- how could anything with a stick of butter in it taste bad? I would make it again. Thank you Margaret for the interesting recipe.",

I'm not sure what the step involving cooking the cabbage in the potato pot is for. Whether it is to save another pot to clean or to enhance the flavor of the cabbage. I started out with it that way but it stopped the boiling process so I ended up just adding it into the carrots and onions I was cooking part way through the potato boiling process. Medium high is too high for cooking the onions and carrots they would be burnt before 10 minutes is up. I halved the recipe and the 1/2 cup of milk I dumped into the potatoes was way too much. What was I thinking? I ended up having to cook them to get the liquid out so I could finish the recipe up. Good flavor needed more salt on my end which is easy enough fix. Not sure if the balsamic actually did anything to the flavor may add it directly into the carrot mixture the next time. A good recipe thanks!",
