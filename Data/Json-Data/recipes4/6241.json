I didn't have any beef stock, so I added just chicken stock and a couple of large tablespoons of better than bouillon roasted beef flavor base and it was delicious. Since this base is a concentrated paste and salty I didn't add any extra salt and it was perfect. Soup to me isn't soup without a few bay leaves so added those. I used mezze penne and cooked it for only 6 minutes separately and then added it in when I took it off of the stove. Nice recipe and is a keeper. I'm surprised that this recipe didn't have more reviews. It really is quite good.",
