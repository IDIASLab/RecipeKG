                "reviewBody": "Just enjoying a slice of pie made with this dough recipe, and it's hard not to keep going back and goo-ing up my hands with \"one more bite\" of it until I finish this review! The quintessential New York pizza has a thin, seared crust layer on the bottom, with light, ethereal bread topped with a thin layer of sauce, cheese, and whatever other items ring your bells. This does not disappoint on any score. This dough stretches easily to supreme thinness when allowed to rest as recommended in the fridge. That's one detraction, that you need to plan ahead. But it can be made and rested for up to 2 days, so no problem. A baking stone is a must for success, as when it's preheated, it will sear the bottom of the crust by instantly drawing out the surface moisture. As for \"blandness\" that some dislike, remember that a great crust acts as a backdrop for your accoutrements. It's not the star. It is, however, a very important supporting player. If desired, you can flavor it with herbs and/or a few Tb of Parmesan. I found the dough to be too sticky with the proportions listed. Whereas I fully understand that a pizza dough needs as little flour as possible, no way could you work with it, until I added about 1/4 cup of flour, which left it still very sticky, but able to be handled with floured hands. Experiment. You want it sticky, but not quasi-liquid. You're going to love this crust. Second-generation Italian girl here, New York born and raised, and I can tell you, THIS is the real deal.",

I use the same ingredients listed, though I might add up to a cup more flour depending on the humidity, b/c like the recipe states, this IS very sticky dough.  To make by hand, I mixed the yeast and water to proof.  Then I added the salt, a tsp or two of sugar (that's my only addition), and mixed in the flour until it was able to be turned out onto a floured surface for kneading.  I kneaded for 5-10 minutes.  Like the recipe states, the dough will be sticky, so I add just enough flour so that it's able to be handled but that it's also not a \"stiff\" dough.  It should be very pliable and soft like a baby's bottom, like the submitter stated ;-)  Then I patted it with oil and let it rise (about 1 hour).  I then punched it down and made it into 2 crusts; one 10\" round pan and one for a 11x13\" rectangle sheet.  This dough is easily \"tossed\" and stretched, so have fun with it! **I prebaked our crusts for about 8 minutes on 450\u00b0, until they barely started to have golden edges.  Then I topped them and baked for about 10 more minutes, until it \"looked\" done.  The center of our pizzas had a thin, chewy crust, and the big outside edges were delicious with a slight crisp outside, and chewy center.  Yum!!  Next time I'll get some nacho cheese to use as a dip for our crusts, which were tastier than breadsticks IMO:-)  I definitely recommend this dough, it's simple and delicious.",

I have been experimenting for 3-4 yrs, with much advice from NY professionals, horrible flops, many trials & errors...and then success. I have since bought a KitchenAid mixer and its so much better to mix the dough, as those of you who have suggested here have done. Whether you are able to handle it very wet or decide to add a bit more flour...make sure you do the autolyse (sit & soak of the flour) first and keep it 'pancake batter-like' when doing the preliminary mixing of ingredients-- its crucial! Then add more flour and mix or knead for 10-15 mins. :) Enjoy!",
