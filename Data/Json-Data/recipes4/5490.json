It\u2019s rich, flavorful and colorful, not to mention just plain interesting.  A LOT more interesting, in fact, than the typical tomato-based Mexican rice.  I stayed true to the recipe save for the carrots, which I only omitted because I don\u2019t care for them.  Saffron, the most expensive spice as I know of, has a unique and characteristic flavor and color  that really can\u2019t be duplicated, tho\u2019 turmeric would work as a more economical substitute.  I made this to accompany Slow Cooker Guisado Verde and Skillet Summer Squash, both recipes also from this site.  It was a beautiful and uncommonly delicious meal, in large part because of this beyond the ordinary Mexican rice.  Mamacita, no doubt, is a darn fine cook.  Thanks, Armi, for sharing her recipe.",

Being that I'm on an \"out of work\" budget, I've been on the lookout for dishes that stretch a dollar (or two). Admittedly, for this reason alone, this was quite the disappointment for me. For one, NO WHERE does this recipe state what TYPE of saffron to use. Threads????? Powder???? If threads, how many??? After a CONSIDERABLE amount of time researching equivalents on the WWW, I decided that the measurement here MUST be for powder and that the proper amount would be approximately 5-7 threads per 1/4 teaspoon. Even after adding ~ 12 threads, my rice was not the beautiful golden color I expected (disappointment #2). All in all, this was \"OK,\" but not something I'd make again. Thanks anyways, Armi. :-)",

It is sold in dry form in a small packet or in jars almost like a thick salsa to add to food.  I think in Spanish it is called \"azafran\".  Not the expensive, imported stuff.  This is a nice recipe.  You can add tomato paste or sauce in place of the tomato.  You can also omit the peas and carrots.",
