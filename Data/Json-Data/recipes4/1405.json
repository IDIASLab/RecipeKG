Grilled them directly on grill for a few minutes on each side.For the greens I carmelized some red onion and thick cut bacon in a little olive oil with a bit of turbinado sugar and splash of balsamic then sauteed the greens for just a few minutes until tender and bright green. Served the grilled beets on top of the greens. The flavors were bright and simple!",

I bought some golden beets (deep yellow flesh) at a local farmers' market, and was looking for a way to prepare them on the grill. I peeled the beets, which the recipe doesn't specify, and I used thyme, marjoram & savory in place of herbes de provence, and added salt and pepper. The balsamic vinegar complements the beets very well. I will definitely make this again--thanks!",

I had about 5 beets I was working with and didn't want to be relying solely on the grill to get all the slices cooked through. However the taste is wonderful even though I only had fresh rosemary and had to use dried herbs for the rest. I cut the leftover slices into chunks today and threw them in the pasta/veggie salad I already had and they added a wonderful flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again!",

I also marinated longer than called for but I wouldn't do that again. Usually I prefer more flavor but the herbs and vinegar overpowered the beet flavor.
