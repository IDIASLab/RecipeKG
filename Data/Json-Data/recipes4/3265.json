I did this in a glass dish in the oven at 390 for 35 minutes and then let it sit under the grill for 5 minutes. In the filling I used spring onions (green onions or scallions) and used creamed mushrooms. I brushed the top with my own steak marinade which has a bit of a sour back taste from the balsamic vinegar. Next time I'll add some ground esspresso to my BBQ seasoning. (It sounds weird but it adds an amazing depth of flavour.) This gave it a very nice mix of complex flavours. But there are an amazing variety of changes you could make here. In the future I'm planning on stuffing it with feta/spinach bacon bit and breadcrumb mix. I will say that I can see it being tough to build this loaf without the structure of a glass dish. I did learn a quick tip. Put half of the beef at the bottom and then build a wall as an edge. Fill the cavity with your filling and then all you have to do is top it with the rest of the beef. Worked for me.",
