I used the plastic bag trick suggested by another reviewer and added about a half of a sweet onion quartered. Then put it all on a roasting pan lined in parchment paper. They roasted for 20 minutes with a turn about halfway thru. I saut\u00e9ed 3 garlic cloves in olive oil and added some fresh pesto spiced with red pepper. When the tomatoes were done i just funneled the parchment paper and poured it all in the pan with the garlic. After boiling pasta I added a good splash maybe a half cup of the pasta water to the mix. Easy fast and a good way to use all the tomatoes. Next time I think I will roast a red pepper along with the tomatoes and onions and then throw it all in a food processer and make a smooth sauce.",

I doubled it and purchased the 19oz bag of frozen Tortellini from the freezer section as it was WAY more affordable. I added zucchini a yellow pepper and red onion to the tomato in the oven and threw all veggies in a bag and added oil and spices that way (easier and you use less oil). Save some of the pasta water to add to the entire mixture if it's a little too dry and then top with a quick splash of quality EVOO sea salt crushed red pepper flakes and crumbled goat cheese.",
