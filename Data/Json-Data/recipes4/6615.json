In serving, I used flat corn tostada shells and layered the following: lettuce, chicken mixture, monterrey jack cheese, avacado slices, chopped tomato, cilantro cream (Which cut the spice - used allrecipes \"Amy's cilantro cream sauce\"), & few leaves of cilantro for garnish!!!

I was worried that the full can of chiles in adobo would be too spicy (and I love spicy food, but recall having once ruined a recipe from using too many of them) so I only used half, but I definitely should have used the whole can--with all of the tomato sauce, it actually came out pretty mild. 2-3 hours on low was just the right amount of time to cook the chicken. I skipped the chorizo and just made this until step 2 and returned the shredded chicken to the slow cooker for about another 40 minutes. This was fantastic as tacos on soft corn tortillas with chopped onion and fresh cilantro! Made great lunch leftovers for the next day, too!",

                "reviewBody": "This was a nice change for our standard Taco Tuesday dinner night. Topped with lettuce, chopped cherry tomatoes, shredded cheese, cilantro, guacamole, and plain Greek yogurt (instead of sour cream). Were it not for the toppings, this might have been a little too spicy for us (& we love hot & spicy) but the toppings helped cool the heat plus the cherry tomatoes added a touch of sweetness that paired well with the spicy heat.\n My only complaints are: 1) chorizo is VERY greasy, even when well-drained, but that's just how chorizo is so it wouldn't be fair to take away a star just for that. Next time, I'll halve the amount of chorizo, just for my personal health preferences. 2) I'm not a fan of having to use a skillet pan when prepping a slow cooker meal, esp. when the recipe adds this extra step midway through the cooking time. The beauty of crockpot cooking is being able to just throw everything in and have it ready by dinnertime, so to make this easier, I put everything in the crockpot except the chorizo and onion (& used frozen chicken breasts directly from the freezer) and let it cook during the day. Right before dinner, while crisping up the tostada shells in the oven, I cooked the chorizo and onions in my skillet and stirred it into the chicken mixture right before serving. I also cheated by using dried minced onions since I didn't feel like chopping up an onion. Faster and easier to make this way & every bit as tasty!",

Agree with some of the other reviewers: this is spicy hot -- although part of it may have been my problem as I did not seed the chipotle peppers. Did not shred the chicken and return it to the sauce nor did I use the chorizo at all. Served it over brown rice and took recommendations and added sour cream and a simple guacamole. While that certainly tempered the heat considerably needed to put the dish in the microwave to reheat. (All the cold ingredients made the dish cooler than lukewarm.) That having been said DH absolutely loved it; suggested next time we use it in enchiladas. To that end will double the tomato sauce and cut down just slightly on the chipotle peppers pour the sauce over the assembled enchiladas and top that with cheese before baking. Will still serve with sour cream and guacamole cuz it's going to be needed. All and all however not a bad dish. Thanks angelosmommy for an interesting recipe.",
