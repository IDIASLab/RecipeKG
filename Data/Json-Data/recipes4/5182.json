I used Wildtree Peachy Keen BBQ sauce and my apricot preserves to smother the salmon and it was a hit. The only additional thing I did was to season the salmon with salt and pepper before placing the BBQ mixture on top, just wanted to balance the sweet and savory.

Couldn't have been easier to prepare & it was ready to be plated alongside lentils & saut\u00e9ed spinach didn't need fresh lemon or any further condiments. YUM! Try this!
