This was a nice change and nice that most of the ingredients I had on hand.  I did use 1 can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the mayo.  It just sounded better.  It was terrific.  You can also use any topping like cornflakes and butter or French's onions if you don't have croutons. Hope you enjoy!",

I've been making this regularly for a long time and always feel guilty eating it because of the large amount of butter and mayonnaise. So, I've tweaked it: 1. I always double the recipe since one head of cauliflower yields at least 4 cups. 2. I replace most of the mayonnaise with nonfat plain greek yogurt. 3. I cook the broccoli and cauliflower together (why not?). 4. I omitted the butter entirely last time and it was still yummy. 5. I use far less than a full package of croutons. Sometimes I use crushed crackers or breadcrumbs. With all these changes, we still love this, so the basic recipe is awesome. With the lower-fat changes, it's not quite as rich and creamy, but it feels healthier and still tastes great.",
