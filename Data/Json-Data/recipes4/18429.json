This recipe is not as quick as a plain basic way to cook buckwheat, but it's so worth it and smells and tastes so good. Serve hot with a small piece of butter on top.",

I also amped up the umami by using black truffle oil, chicken stock, and smoked sea salt. Overall it was fantastic.  I had not had groats before but I loved the texture and will definitely give it a repeat.  Next time I will use miso broth.",
