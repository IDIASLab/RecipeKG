Someone mentioned trying vegetable broth instead but I loved the beef broth. I actually added macaroni and wieners yes wieners to add some meat for a full meal. And I was hoping it would intrigue my two little girls which it totally did. My four-year-old told me the next time I make soup to make this soup. I will definitely make this again but I think next time I will use fresh vegetables instead of frozen. Although frozen is a good alternative if you don't have fresh veggies in the fridge.

I did simmer it for almost two hours to thicken it up and \"melt\" the potatoes. The frozen veggies will be for next time since all I had were peas. I serve it with cheese toast made under the broiler with a little paprika on top. Yummy! I wish I knew about this years ago because it's a great stock for whatever is in the fridge. V8 juice has a real \"bright\" flavor that canned tomatoes just don't have. My sister is pretty much anti-veggie but she really liked this recipe. I'm keeping V8 juice in my pantry now!",
