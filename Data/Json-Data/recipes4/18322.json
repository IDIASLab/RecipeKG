But dang, is it good!\" I halved the recipe for 2 adults and 2 kiddos, using a can of Rotel and one 15 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of the puree and made it in advance, letting it simmer in the dutch oven for an afternoon, tucking it into the fridge, then re-simmering next day b4 serving with cheese and Frito scoops. Nothing outstanding about this chili but maybe that's why we ate all of it up with no complaints. It's just a good, easy, basic chili. Can't wait for cooler Fall temperatures so we can have it again.",
