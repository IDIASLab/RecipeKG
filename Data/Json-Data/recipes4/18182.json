It brings all the comfort of your standard bowl of chili, but with a wonderful mildly seasoned and sweet taste that is sure to be a hit with family and friends, both young and old! Garnish with your favorite toppings; I chose shredded cheese, cilantro, onion, black olives, and a dab of sour cream. This would be great served with corn bread and a side salad.",

This is not really what my family would consider \"chili\" more like \"Mexican rice\" instead. It was tasty and came together fast though let it sit covered for about 10 minutes after cooking and it thickens more. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #Soupstewchili #FacelessNoMore",
