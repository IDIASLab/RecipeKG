I was lucky that I was able to go to a German butcher and purchase the meat that they cut just for Rouladen.  It is very, thin meat about 6 inches long.  Ideally, your meat should be long enough to roll at least 3 times.   You probably won't be able to buy the thick pork bacon that is used in Germany so use thin sliced bacon.  It will taste better than regular thick sliced bacon.  Also, to assist with the flavor put in 1 envelope of Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix.    You can then thicken the gravy after the rolls are done to serve over them. Overall, this a very close copy of what we eat in Germany.",

My wife likes the pickles in, but my sons and I don't. I usually have to make 8-10 large ones to feed the family.\r\nMake sure the mustard has horse radish in it. Yum!\r\n\r\nTo make it a little easier, I use \"sandwich steaks\". They're cut thin to begin with and I additionally pound (tenderize) them further sandwiched between plastic wrap or wax paper. The process is the basically the same from there.\r\n\r\nI brown them and place them in a pot with 2-3 cans of beef broth. I also add a bay leaf or two. Two smahed cloves of garlic. (Taken out later) Also a tablespoon of the mustard and a couple of peppercorns are added to the broth. I usually will also add a little worchestershire sauce. I use a medium colored roue (spelling?) to thicken the gravy after I take the rolls out of the pot.Don't forget to remove the bay leaf, garlic, and peppercorns. Let them cook for a good long time until they barely hold together. \r\n\r\nWe serve them with plain boiled russets and top it with the gravy.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

Couple of hints - vary the mustard type, bacon and pickles for different taste sensations.  And for those who are leery of the pickles, dice them up - still get the great flavor but you don't realize it's in there!  And always make gravy with the liquid - it's the best.  I dice up all the \"stuffers\" - onions, bacon and pickles - and if I have any leftovers after filling the rolls, I throw them in the liquid - makes the gravy even better!",

Add just a tiny bit of beef bouillion water & a splash of red wine to the slowcooker (also fresh ground pepper & a couple bay leaves) and let them cook on high heat for 3-4 hours. This made let so tender you could cut them with a fork. Quickly whisk the juice from the slowcooker with a little cornstarch/water paste to make a flavourful gravy. Guten Appetit!",

It is to-die-for good. Like Dr. Bones I use either sandwich steaks or very thinly sliced round steak. I have made it both with and without the pickle and mustard and while I know that to use them is traditional our family prefers them with just the bacon and onion. I simmer them a good hour and a half in beef broth once they're browned adding more broth or water as it reduces. Once they're good and tender I thicken the gravy with flour and more broth. I prefer to serve these little \"roll mops\" with hot buttered noodles but my family insists on mashed potatoes. Thanks for posting the recipe!",

This year, we made Rouladen twice in one week, each time making over 250 for our lunch menu!  However,I would add this:  we use regular mustard, garlic salt, NO horseradish, and dice the bacon, onion and pickles up VERY small. We do not use any boullion, but add carrots and celery to the water over the rolls while cooking.  After sauteing and placing them into a shallow baking pan,we cover the pan w/saran wrap and then aluminum foil, put in a 300 degree oven for several hours until tender. We strain the carrots, celery and broth into a tall stockpot, literally \"smashing\" the vegetables through the strainer and  discarding the fiber, then thickening w/corn starch. We serve the traditional Spaetzle, or tiny dumplings alongside. By all means, ask your butcher to cut top round 1/5\" thick for you. In rolling the rouladen, think \"burrito\".  It will keep all the good stuff inside! Good eating!",
