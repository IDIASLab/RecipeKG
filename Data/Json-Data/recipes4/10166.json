It is: 1 large size jello, 2 cups hot water (no cold water), 1/2 pint orange sherbert or a little more. Jello should be a thick syrupy consistency and then add 1 cup drained mandarin oranges. This fills a small jello mold. I have never ever had problems with this setting up and have made this since I was a child. I really hope this helps, if it doesn't set up, then you didn't add enough sherbert. Good luck!",
