My only issue with it (and the reason for the lost star) is that I found it very VERY difficult to crush the lemon drops. I had to have my husband whack them with a mallet and even he had trouble getting them to break apart; and the double-layer of plastic freezer bags wasn't enough to keep the shards from tearing through. Had to be very careful to not get plastic shreds in the bark.",
