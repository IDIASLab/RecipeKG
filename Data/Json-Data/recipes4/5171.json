First, I used roasted garlic hummus since I prefer that flavor.  Also I seeded the cucumber and tomatoes before chopping to keep the mixture from being too watery.  Finally I used greek seasoning and a pinch of salt instead of just oregano.  I find that the mint and other spices in the greek mix just had a better flavor.  Layered in a 9\" pie plate and served with pita chips, carrots, and celery.  Huge hit!!!",

I start with lemon hummus instead of the red pepper - it's bright and tangy and we like that taste with the other ingredients. Then we use a thin layer of tzatziki then the layer of kalamata olives then add in a layer of artichoke hearts then the feta and then the cucumber the tomato and we top it with a good sprinkling of short sliced red onion. We don't use the oil or oregano - just let the flavors of the dip stand on their own. I also place a small dish of pepperocinis on the side for those who like that extra little bite with the dip. Serve with some good sea salt pita chips and you are good to go. Add wine or a cocktail and it's a great girl's night meal.",

I made this in a pie pan omitting the olives due to personal taste. Served this with pita chips tortilla chips and crackers. Everyone wanted a different \"dipper\" for the dip. Very good and I will make again. Thanks k8e204 for sharing.",

Otherwise I made half as written and half adding 4 oz greek yogurt and some diced red onion and greek peppers. It was good both ways but I definitely like what the yogurt added to it.I used a 9x9 dish and thought it still worked well with the added ingredients. Leftovers made nice pita sandwiches. I really enjoy greek salads and never thought of a dip thanks for the great idea.",
