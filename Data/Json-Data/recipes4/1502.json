I think I'm with the reviewer who suggested using this method as a casserole instead; my eggplant \"shells\" were only edible on the bottom even though I covered it with foil. Maybe I should have used more sauce but next time I think I'll just chop the entire eggplant and follow the recipe from there without stuffing - less waste that way. Still a great idea!",

My boyfriend likes an eggplant dish so much at one of our local restaurants but said that everytime he tried to make it it turned out terrible. I have never really had it but decided to try it. I salted the eggplant and left it for 1/2 an hour before squeezing out some liquid. I think this helped a lot as it made it meatier rather then mushier. I also added three small breakfast sausages in with the eggplant which added a TON of great flavour and doubled the garlic.
