I forgot to include the onion/spices when I browned the sausage, so I added the onion over the sausage when assembling and mixed 1/2 the spices in the eggs and sprinkled the other 1/2 over the sausage.  I left it on the counter while the oven preheated and then baked for 45 minutes.  I was a little apprehensive about 2 T and 1 T of spices, but they worked!  I couldn't find ground sausage, so I decased a package of Johnsonville Mild Sausage and used that.  I can see this finding a place in our breakfast casserole rotations.  THANKS for the recipe!",

I followed recipe except I added a cup more cheese just because i had it in my fridge and added dry mustard to egg mixture because I like eggs with that little kick. I think the first time I forgot the chili powder but it was awesome anyway.  I made this for brinner (what my goofy family calls it when we have breakfast for dinner). We are a 5 crew family and we had enough left over to feed the 3 teenagers breakfast the next morning so yatzee on 2 meals in one!!",

So instead of sausage I used 1lb. ground turkey and 1 lb. crumbled cooked bacon. I bake the bacon in the oven in a shallow cookie pan on foil. I only add the chili powder (no basil onion or garlic) to the ground turkey while I am browning it. VERY tasty and huge crowd pleaser! Put out the salsa for those who want top it off! Serve with melon (cantaloupe) cubes and gluten free Danish!",
