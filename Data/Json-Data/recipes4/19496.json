        "description": "Pineapple baked rice uses a pineapple skin as a bowl, stuffing it with fried rice. After you bake it for 15 minutes, the pineapple flavor will go into the rice and your whole house will be filled with pineapple aroma! This is great for kids. It has vegetables and a light, sweet taste. You may add cheese on top of the rice if you like. I personally don't like to add cheese, I want to keep the dish simple and original. I serve it as a main course for Chinese New Year.",
