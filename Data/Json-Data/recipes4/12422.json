Made it twice with 2nd time coming out much better after some changes were made. 1st and 2nd time I used the Salad Shooter with wide blade to chop broccoli 1st time: I used 2 tsp salt (too salty for us) so cut back to 1 tsp. I served it right after making and added shredded Cheddar cheese (it took away the broccoli taste which we love). 2nd time: I used the boiled water from cooking broccoli to make the sauce using all-purpose flour (last time I used Wondra a gravy flour). After making in large saucepan I poured the soup into top pan for double boiler and let it sit covered 1 hour before serving. To warm it I put fresh water in lower double boiler pan to prevent scorching. Soup was very creamy and tastier. By the way I used 2 cups of broccoli instead of 1. Thanks for sharing with us.",
