I assume they must have originated in Europe and each country has a name for them. I have heard them called Runzas also. They really are simple. I have found that I cannot substitute anything for the MSG. They just lose the flavor. If your ground beef is too lean, these tend to be dry. I sometimes add cheese to them to offset this problem. I have also added fennel seed, about 1 teaspoon, although the recipe does not call for it.",

Use Mrs. Dash for extra zing and it is a very good sandwich. You can also use refrigerated dough instead of bread dough - just as good!",

I usually put in some cumin and I like that taste. When they come out of the oven I like to cut open the top and sprinkle in the cheese and top with some sour cream. One thing though--The bread dough should probably be brought up to room temperature. I thawed mine in the refrigerator and it was impossible to roll out the dough until had warmed up. I like the idea of spreading butter on the finished product. Maybe some garlic powder or some other seasoning in the melted butter might be tasty too",
