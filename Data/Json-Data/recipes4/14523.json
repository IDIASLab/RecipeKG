We use only a half pound of ground beef,  2 cans of tomato soup, 2 cups of rotini noodles. We like ours a bit more soupy and 1 lb of ground beef was far too much. Garlic powder instead of cloves because it is much easier (1/8tsp per clove). I do keep the bouilon in the recipe, a little less italian seasoning and omit the cornstarch altogether because it didn't seem to do much aside from leave clumps of cornstarch. We used to make a lasagna soup and this has definitely replaced it. Amazing!",

Mixed in the \"Italian Seasoning Mix\" from this site for the Italian seasoning. This took longer than the time specified for the noodles to cook. After 10 minutes uncovered I simmered covered for another 10 minutes. This made the broth thick so no corn starch was needed. My daughter thought this had a little sweet taste to it. After all was said and done thumbs up. I mixed in low-fat cottage cheese in mine. Hubby added crushed red pepper flakes to his. The pre-packaged mixes might be a little cheaper but this hands down tastes better.",
