You can add in whatever fresh vegetables you have on hand, and experiment with herbs and dressings. I didn't have any lemons on hand but I had a lemon poppy seed dressing which was too thick for this salad, so I thinned it into a vinaigrette with olive oil and vinegar. I served this with a hard-boiled egg on the side for an extra protein kick.",

If I were making for a party I would do the fuller recipe and I m sure it would be amazing. I was tying to make it very low fat so I used only lemon and white vinegar and 1 tsp of oil as the dressing. It was still wonderful. I will make this a staple of my diet. Thank you!!",

Followed remainder of recipe. Hubby said this was the best salad I ever made bar none. He said the crunchy cukes made all the difference.",
