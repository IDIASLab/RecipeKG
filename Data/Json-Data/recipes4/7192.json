The directions don't say how you should cook the chicken, so I cooked it in a separate pan on the stove and then added the saut\u00e9ed onion and garlic, (because how can you not have garlic?), to the chicken. I also used some basil and some italian seasoning on the chicken. I found it strange that this recipe had no added spices or anything. Then after that was mixed up a bit, I added the tomatoes and stirred in the cream cheese so that it could melt together nicely. Then I took all of that off the oven and mixed it in with the spinach and the cooked noodles and placed it in a casserole dish. Covered it with cheese and baked it in the oven. It was pretty yummy. I will say I accidentally made too many noodles because I used no yolk noodles instead of penne, so I think next time if I use the right amount of noodles, the flavors will be much better. This has a good basis for a delicious family pasta dish. I will make this again.",

For things in a pasta bake, no surprise, it's good!\" I've made many variations of pasta bakes, but my tastebuds always fall back on wanting my classic chicken/spinach, so I was happy to try out this recipe, only Oops! I didn't have cream cheese, but that's OK, b/c I just added some extra Italian-blend shredded cheese and it still retained its yummy factor. Also sauteed garlic along w/ the onion b/c something seems infinitely askew w/ the kitchen universe when I don't smell the 2 mating in olive oil together. Had to S&P to taste, but all in all, a successful pasta bake.",

It doesn't tell you how to make the chicken but I saut\u00e9ed it with garlic basil a dash of salt pepper and a dash of thyme. First I boiled the noodles (al dente') about 11 min. While boiling the noodles i saut\u00e9ed the boneless skinless chicken tenderloins (with the seasoning listed above). I added the onions to the chicken and saut\u00e9ed again for about 6 min. Once onions browned I added the penne pasta (drained of course). Then I added the diced tomatoes. I couldn't find \"Italian-styled\" diced tomatoes so I added Italian herb seasoning and about 2 teaspoons of sugar). I stirred that together and added it to the pasta chicken and onions. I transferred it to a big baking dish and added the cream cheese and spinach. I mixed all of it together in the baking dish and sprinkled the mozzarella cheese through the dish and on top for garnish. Baked it covered with foil for 30 min and it came out perfect! The entire family loved it! I will be making this again in the future and will save this as one of my favorite family dishes!",
