I didn't need to let it simmer for more than 45mins to get the desired consistency. My husband really liked it and it definitely reminded me of traditional French onion soup. My only complaint was that the picture was misleading and made it look like a creamer soup. Since I was in a bit of a mood for creamy soup I added a dollop of 2% Greek yogurt to my serving (you could also use sour cream though it's not as healthy) and it gave the soup a nice smooth consistency. Will probably make again.",
