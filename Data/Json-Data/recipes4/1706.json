I think I have perfected SOS (Creamed Beef).Very simple and quick. Serve over toast (Shingles) or biscuits or hashed brown potatoes. I know leaving the grease in is not real healthy but it really makes it tasty. If you use anything other then HAMBURGER or drain the grease it will not turn out.",

I also upped the flavor a bit by using finely diced red onion browned with the beef and added a small amount of worcestershire sauce plus fresh chopped parsley.  Served over toast with sliced fresh tomatoes, this made a very satisfying meal.",

Thank you so much for taking the time to put your recipe on here.  I didn't drain the beef, but I did use extra lean hamburger meat so that there wasn't quite so much grease in the skillet. :)  YUM!

I was worried it would be really peppery, but I actually couldn't really taste the pepper.  The spices were all nicely balanced, and not one flavor overpowered another, so if I do increase the seasoning, I'd keep them at the same ratio to each other.  :::EDIT::: I made this again with slightly leaner beef (80/20) and the sauce was WAY too thick this time around without that extra fat to soak up the flour.  It still tasted great (I did double the seasoning this time), but I think in the future when using 80/20 ground chuck I'll reduce the flour to 1/3 cup.",

I did have to use 2 cups of milk instead of just 1 1/2 cups, but that was expected from other reviews.  Overall I will be making this again, and again.",
