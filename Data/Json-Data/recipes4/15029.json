We were mixed as to whether to even try this because I didn't want to waste a corned beef if the flavors were too \"conflicted\".  On the other hand, the \"same old\" corn beef and cabbage IS kind of boring.  WOW was this good. The ammounts of coconut milk and curry paste were just enough to \"hint\" at the changed recipe and there was a richness in the broth that we both loved.  Only change I made was to use a crock pot instead of a dutch oven.  Now my wife and I are talking about whether to \"push\" the coconut milk and curry to make them a little more prominent.  We LOVED this as written and I recommend this as a change.  It is NOT radical nor conflicted at the table.  thanks rc",

Even after doubling the red curry paste I still could not get the essence of the curry to come through. I tripled the suggested amount to 6 tsps added another can of coconut milk and another tablespoon of fish sauce trying to create a creamier balance. Threw in carrots celery and onion but held the potatoes until the end cutting into bite size pieces and boiled them 20 minutes in the broth after corned beef was done. Yummy. At the same time I cooked a Guinness Corn Beef in another crock pot. 10 hours later there was not much difference in flavor of the beefs. The texture was very moist on the Coconut Curry one. Amazingly moist compared to the beer broth beef with less pronounce grain and hints of the curry linger in the taste buds. Both fell apart and were consumed without a scrap left. I cook twice a day for 15 office employees. Will not be afraid of that curry next time! and will try to make a gravy with that broth next time using a heavy cream and yogurt base. Thanks Chef John!
