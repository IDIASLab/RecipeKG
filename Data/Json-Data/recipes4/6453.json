The fish only needs a thin coat of sauce and I knew the amount was going to be way too much but I figured I could save it for future use. At least that was the plan until hubby used it to top his baked potato and that was the end of that. Will definitely make again but in the future I will incorporate the dill into the sour cream sauce instead of sprinkling it directly on the fish.",

It's a really good BASIC recipe, but as with all things, I made some changes.  \n\nI add some liquid (about a teaspoon) of the liquid that the capers are in and omit the salt from the sauce.  I also add in some lemon juice to taste.   I also added some finely shopped dill (a couple sprigs).  This makes the sauce a little thinner and much more bold.\n\nI also add a couple drops of lemon juice on top of the fish before I bake it.\n\nThis is so good served with yellow rice and a seasoned veggie on the side.",
