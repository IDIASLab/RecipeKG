I was a little confused by the photo though because that definitely is zucchini squash, not delicata, which have completely different flavor profiles.  I made a few changes which made this awesome: I halved the delicata, seeded, and sprayed with some I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray.  I then put them into a preheated 425 degree oven with no water for 30-45 minutes until they were soft and had a dark roasted color (the cooking time will depend on the size of your squash).  In the meantime I sauteed half a red onion (I didn't have any shallots) and garlic in some canola oil which is actually healthier than olive.  Then added 1/3 cup chopped walnuts (no pine nuts on hand) and chopped leaves of one celery heart, the tender yellow ones.  When that was all soft and fragrant I added the quinoa and sauteed until it glistened, and then added 2 cups of vegetable broth and some freshly ground black pepper.  The broth, celery, and pepper took care of the bland flavor others mentioned.  When the quinoa was done I stuffed it into the squash cavities, sprinkled with grated parmesan, and returned to the oven until the cheese was golden brown.  It was truly DELISH!!",
