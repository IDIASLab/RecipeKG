I made this as directed and was surprised by how boring and bland the flavors turned out. The roasted peppers recooked in the wine at the end with the oregano ended up turning into an almost spaghetti like sauce just with peppers instead of tomatoes. I think next time I won't waste my time roasting and just cook them at the end with the onions and maybe add some garlic.",
