I cooked mine over the stove and when it was done cooking I added 3 tbs of olive oil and 1 tsp or yellow curry to a large skillet ( more like a rounded wok really very deep) i then added 4 chicken thighs cut into 1 inch pieces and sauteed till cooked after they were done I put them in a bowl to wait Using the same oil I added 2 med onions chopped and sauteed till they started turned brown then I added a handful of coarsely chopped unsalted baking cashews to the mixture returned the chicken and added the already cooked rice stirring frequently over med heat until thoroughly heated and mixed. Turn off the burner and let sit for 10 min or so. This will allow the cashews to really soak in the flavor and be nice and tender with the dish. I'm telling you this tastes just like the stuff they serve at restaurants. So good. Everyone LOVED it! happy cooking",

To doctor it: You're better off adding some chicken/beef broth base or seasoning to the mix for flavor (I use Orrington Farms no MSG). And doing this would keep true to the \"easy\" way. But honestly you're better off making the \"Authentic Bangladeshi Beef Curry\" recipe that you can type in the search engine near the top of the page. Never stop trying nickval2010!",

I also did not put 3 Tablespoons of curry powder because that seemed like way too much seasoning for that little rice. I decided that it was meant to be read \"3 Teaspoons\" and used just that. I really enjoyed how it came out. It was in need of just a little more salt at the end of cooking and my curry powder might have been on the cheap side and had to adjust the taste just a tad (I needed to add a small extra sprinkle of ginger nutmeg and garlic as well). Another thing that is wonderful with this recipe just cut up your favorite sausage and dump it in with your cooking rice. spices the sausage and gives a little extra to the rice.",
