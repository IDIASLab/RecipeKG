                "reviewBody": "Thank you for sharing this recipe I made a few changes based on the other reviews and to reduce cooking time. I added additional turmeric. However word of advice on that; turmeric is one of those spices that become more flavorful when cooked so it's imperative to do a good browning of it when it's first added (so don't add too much!). I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. I cubed the chicken breasts and seasoned them with garlic salt pepper and cumin prior to browning. I used chicken broth instead of water however I think I will stick with water next time. After squeezing the juice from the lemon I tossed the lemon in the pot to simmer along with the chicken (of course I removed the lemon prior to serving).:) Also I used canned chick peas which I added at the very end since they didn't need to cook but just warm up. We ate this over couscous with a side of green beans (I know not very exotic but the green beans went well with the dish). My husband and kids all loved this dish. On a side note my hubby ate chili peppers with his - he loves spicy food - and said it was fabulous. We'll definitely be making this again very delicious!",

I cooked this in a pressure cooker because I hadn't soaked the chickpeas - I used 4 cups of water 1 cup dry chickpeas frozen chicken pieces and cooked on high pressure 40 minutes - other than that I followed the recipe as instructed.
