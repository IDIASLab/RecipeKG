Now that i have made it a few times I have done it with ground chicken leftover cut up chicken from a whole smoked chicken we cooked on out smoker and also vegetarian because our neighbor is a vegetarian and all variations were very good. Even the vegetarian way. We like this best with the ground chicken and when making the peanut butter sauce we use Adams all natural chunky PB and add much more hot water than it calls for. I also add a little bit of sesame oil and sriracha sauce to give it a little kick. I don't use the recommended amount of soy sauce in it either - I use way less(in the pb sauce and in the meat mixture both)because alot of people said it was too salty in the reviews. I will definitely continue to make this",
