The one modification I made was to shake the venison cubes in a mixture of flour salt pepper garlic and onion powders and quickly fry them in canola oil before adding to the pot.

First off it was WAY too big to even come close to fitting in my crock pot so unless you have a huge crock pot you need to halve the recipe. I had to transfer everything to a dutch oven and cook it in the oven. The \"sauce\" also didn't have much flavor it definitely needs some more spices in there and I think it would work better with a roux than the corn starch as a thickener. I'm going to keep looking for a good stew recipe sorry but this didn't cut it.",
