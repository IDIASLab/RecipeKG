The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I found the sauce \"as-is\" was too bland for us--I had to add more oyster sauce and soy sauce to give it flavor, so next time I will just use a little less water and reduce the cornstarch accordingly.   I didn't have shrimp, so I used leftover pork chops cut into bite-sized chunks.  We also left out the bell pepper (just a preference) and added some cut baby carrots for color and flavor.  Delicious!  I doubled the recipe for our family of 8, and it made generous portions, so everyone was satisfied, but there were no leftovers!",

The sauce immediately seized up when it hit the hot pan. I had to add another 1/2 cup or so of water to loosen it back up again. This watered down the flavor a little but it was still tasty.
