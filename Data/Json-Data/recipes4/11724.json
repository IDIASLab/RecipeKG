I used a nonstick pan and a little cooking spray and was able to reduce the butter to 1 TB (just for flavor). 2 TB chipotle in adobo sauce (this is the correct spelling not adobe!) gives a high mild/low medium heat level so increase/decrease the amount used to suit your taste. FYI - you will only use 2-3 chipotles in this recipe. Empty the can into a plastic container and store in your fridge. They keep for quite a long time. The adobo sauce adds a nice smoky and spicy flavor to recipes.",

I could only find whole chipotle peppers and found that if I take the seeds out before mincing it's not quite as hot - which is how we like it. I too made it with chicken breast strips using non-stick spray for the chicken breasts and 1 Tbl. margerine for reduced fat. I sauted the chicken first and removed it to a warm platter. Then made the sauce putting the chicken in the re-heat. When making the shrimp I used pre-cooked frozen thawed shrimp and put it in the sauce while it was simmering. Use the large pre-cooked frozen shrimp (our store has been running 2 for 1 specials on bags of this). Delicious!! (also I served the rice on the side)",
