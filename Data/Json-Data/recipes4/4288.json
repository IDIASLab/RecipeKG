I added buttermilk instead of plain milk and being in a hurry didn't cut the dough into squares just rolled it into a wheel and put the beaten egg (yes 1 is enough) on top with some shredded provolone just dumped on it. After 10 minutes it was ready and I cut it into wedges. Wonderful!!! like a pizza but no waiting for the dough to rise! Shamefully easy and quick and I got a lot of praise.",

I sprinkled some flour on it and kneaded away until it was no longer a sticky mess this may just be the advice you were looking for. Good luck! It is a really versatile recipe.",

Drag it through some soup!\" OK maybe I'm a novice when it comes to dough but I had a really difficult sticky disaster of a time rolling this and cutting it into rectangles. And forget dipping them in the egg (btw yes 1 egg's plenty) - I had to brush the egg on. Took more like 22 min. for mine to get even remotely brown. I ate a piece plain (yawn) but liked it a whole lot more when I ate it w/ soup. Later on I spread humus on it toasted and that was pretty tasty but by itself it's a little mundane. Perhaps per one of the more glowing reviews I should've used buttermilk instead?",

The following is where I went with this wonderful bread: First I increased the recipe by 50% then 1) In the dough I mixed 3 tablespoons sliced black olives and 1/4 teaspoon Herbs de Provence. 2) I rolled it out into a circle about 3/8 of an inch thick. 3) I only used 1 egg for brushing the top. 4) For the topping I used 4 sun dried tomatoes (sliced) and equal amounts of assiaga flaked Parmesan and fresh grated mozzarella cheeses totaling 1 cup. Baking time was 19 minutes @ 400 F. It rose to 3/4 of an inch when done. I cut it into squares and served warm at yesterdays St. Patricks Day party. Okay so what I did to it made it so VERY unIrish (more mediteranean). I'm looking forward to using this basic recipe for other tasty experiments!",
