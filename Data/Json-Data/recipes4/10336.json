Then either use an ice cube tray sprayed lightly with Pam or cut a big pan of this down to make cubes and put them in those small condiment cups sold at Costco or Smart and Final.  Line them up on the bar.  This way, they can be slammed down like a shooter without people having to dig them out with a spoon.  Be very careful, you don't taste exactly how much alcohol is in there until way too late.....",
