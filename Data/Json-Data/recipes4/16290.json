Then there is the clean up and the two cups of bread crumbs on my floor (4 cups way too much) and there is no evidence in the picture that bread crumbs were even sprinkled last on top. The recipe was followed to a T... next time I will use less Italian bread crumbs....found that the first round of dipping in egg mixture and dredging in bread crumbs did not hold up in the skillet. For the rest of the slices of eggplant I dusted with flour first then egg mixture and bread crumbs...held up much better in the skillet. I think the amount of Marinara sauce is underestimated...next time I will \"splash\" each piece of eggplant with more Marinara sauce. I definitely will make again and keep my fingers crossed",
