Rather than a whole chicken and an outdoor grill (I hate dark meat), I chose to use boneless chicken breasts and a cast iron grill pan on the stove-top.  Because boneless, skinless chicken breasts are so lean, I added about a tablespoon of olive oil to the marinade to help keep the chicken from drying out as it cooked.  I forgot the garlic salt and didn\u2019t miss it.  In fact, now that I look at the recipe again, the amounts indicated for both the garlic salt and the pepper seemed waaay overload so I\u2019m glad I missed the garlic salt and used the pepper to taste.  The final result was just delicious, especially since I accompanied it with a tomato avocado salsa I made with the recipe Avocado Salad, also from this site.  Hubs is not a fan of either cilantro or avocado, so the fact he was out of town allowed me to make this and to enjoy what I probably would not have tried otherwise!",
