I couldn't really taste the cucumber, but typically can't taste a little celery or carrot added to a smoothie either. I made a 1/2 recipe which yielded 1 serving and not 2. For 1/2 the recipe I did 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries, 1 small frozen sliced banana, 1/4 cup sliced English cucumber. I didn't bother to peel it. It doesn't have a tough skin, 1/4 cup of Trader Joes Greek nonfat vanilla bean yogurt, 1/4 cup of water, and 1 ice cube. I blended in my Vitamix blender about 30 seconds on speed 10 and 20 or so seconds on high. Just needed to tamper it a bit. Calories came to 175, as typed above, and using 1 small banana. I will make this again. TY",
