I made it again with a few modifications and it was WONDERFUL! First I salted the roast before applying the rub. Second I ground the fennel and dill. Third I added 1 tsp. of paprika because all the pre-made porketta roasts in the meat section have it. Also I put it in the slow cooker for 10 hours on low turning once half-way through. Before serving I cut the meat and let it soak in the juices for about 5 minutes. MMMM. I think the leftovers will be shredded and used in sandwiches.",

Thanks for the recipe - My sister's in-laws are Italian and this is their traditional Christmas Day dinner, but they usually order the seasoned roast from a local deli.  They use rosemary instead of the dill, though.  We always roast potatoes in the pan so they get all crisp and seasoned by the spices and drippings - Delicious!",

I got a boneless pork loin roast which he butterflied and pounded a bit. To the herbs he added a bit of olive oil to make a paste then rubbed it on the meat. Then rolled it and tied it and did it on the grill. It was really good... so much better than the premade porkettas we've had. I'm not wild about dill because it can overpower other flavors but it worked well with the other herbs.",
