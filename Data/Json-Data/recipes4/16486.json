I wanted to make a medley of seafood items in a dish very much like yours. I love your ingredients and from that I made a few changes and here\u2019s what I did.Instead of using water I  exchanged that for chicken broth and whole milk instead of half-and-half.I upped the butter to one cup.  In my saut\u00e9 I chopped celery, green onions and white onions.  I added. Oyster sauce, and plenty of obey seasoning. I omitted the tomatoes.  Of course the corn and potatoes.I included cod fish, salmon, shrimp, scallops, oysters, clams, and squid I wanted  but I didn\u2019t have any on hand.       In conclusion my dish was scrumptious. Thank you for helping me through your recipe in creating a dish of seafood medley.  Kevin, Washington DC",

The corn was just overpowering and too weirdly sweet for it, it tasted more like a corn chowder than a seafood chowder. So I would probably just chop up some carrots and celery next time. I would also add more potato to the mixture and not add the dairy until much closer to the end. But it's not a bad recipe and a good base to jump off and customize to your own taste.",
