I've made it dozens of times with only a few minor adjustments. At times I use a mixture of New Mexico and Calif chile powders. If I'm out of one, I'll use the other. Both have the best flavor for enchiladas. There doesn't seem to be a reason to use self-rising flour, so I use regular. If I have chicken broth on hand, I use that as a substite for the water. Same with fresh garlic. I add about an ounce or two of dark chocolate to the mix for a bit more depth in flavor. You can't taste the chocolate, but it does add something. \n\nI dip my corn tortillas in the sauce while the sauce is still pretty hot. I also pour sauce in the bottom of the baking dish before I place the rolled up enchiladas in. Don't worry if your sauce seems too thin; it thickens in the oven.  \n\nDon't bother with any other sauce recipes on this site. Take my word for it, this one is the best.\n\nP.S. The best New Mexico chile powder is the 69 cent \"Chile New Mexico Molido\" in the red, white, and green package by the company \"Mexico Spices Corp\"",

I followed the recipe exactly and the sauce had way too strong of a chili powder flavor to it, I nearly gaged. So I added more garlic pwd, cumin and onion pwd, it ended up tasting pretty good. However next time I will try 3 TBSP chili pwd and double the rest of the spices. I hope this helps someone! Revised: 04-1-08 I made this again and doubled the spices and only used two TBSP of chili powder it was much better, not perfect but much better.",

It sounded like a whole lot of chile pwdr., and I had no idea what the diffference between New Mexico or Calif chile pwdr., but used what I had and it was great.  I started out using half the amount of chile pwdr. called for just in case and found I needed the entire amount called for.  When it was done, the sauce was a little bland for my taste, so I upped the amount of garlic, onion, cumin to 3/4 tsp.  It was then great!  To this sauce, I added boiled, shredded chicken, (3 boneless skinless chicken breasts) and 2 cans (4 ounce) green chiles.  WOW!!!!   Now we have a very versatile dish!  Use for tacos, enchiladas, salad, nachos-you can't go wrong and I think the end product was a 5 star!  Use your discretion at upping the amount of spice according to your own taste.",

I also like my garlic, so I double the amount, using granulated, and sometimes I'll add a pinch of cinnamon just for fun. This recipe has replaced the canned stuff in our house.
