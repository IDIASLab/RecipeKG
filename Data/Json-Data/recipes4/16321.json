A wonderful twist on stuffed peppers and a nice change from the usual ground beef/rice/tomato sauce recipes you always see. The gouda and liquid smoke are just the right touch to give these a light smokiness without being overpowering. These are healthy too and one pepper is just the right amount. I was looking forward to having these as my lunches though out the week! Thanks for the great recipe kflamed13! I will definitely be making these again except next time I might use green or even red peppers. These orange ones were expensive little suckers!:)",

Add your favorite all purpose seasoning to the turkey as it cooks like Mrs Dash. Add salt and pepper. I also used fire roasted canned tomatoes. Try a dash or two of Cholula brand hot sauce as a condiment. That really added a kick but didn't overwhelm the other flavors. Loved the lower fat choice of turkey. I used 93% Honeysuckle White Ground Turkey. I plan to make ahead next time and have on hand for a quick weeknight supper.",
