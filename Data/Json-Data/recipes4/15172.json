I couldn't find chickpea flour so I used regular all-purpose flour instead and that seemed to work okay. This soup has lots of opportunities for modifications adding different vegetables tofu etc. Very yummy versatile and really hits the spot and all that ginger is quite soothing especially if you have a cold.",

The broth is absolutely to die for, although it's a stretch to call it \"broth\".  The sauce is very thick, because this isn't so much a soup as it is a noodle dish.  It's also extremely rich, so keep both points in mind if what you're really looking for is soup.  I've eaten it both ways, and you really need noodles of some type, and rice noodles are only one option.  It would be just as tasty over soba or ramen noodles, if that's all you've got.  Fish sauce adds a lovely dimension, so don't skip it if you've got it.  I think lime wedges rather than lemon would be a better accompaniment, but really, this recipe is excellent regardless.",
