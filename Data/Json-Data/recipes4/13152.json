What makes this so different is that we fry it in oil with minced onion and garlic before adding water.  You can also use part water, part chicken broth.  The secret is to not let it overcook because it should come out loose and not sticky.",

To give the recipe it's proper chance, I made it exactly as written--with the exception of using olive oil for the vegetable oil-- and we were simply delighted. There will be other opportunities in the future to play with it, assuming I'd even want to. I served this with \"Baked Orange Roughy with Veggies\" (also from this site) and sauteed baby spinach.
