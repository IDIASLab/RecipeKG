I also don't like mayonnaise, but prefer a plain yogurt style tzaziki sauce - easy to make with plain yogurt, grated cucumber, garlic & lemon juice.  I made these the second time with the changes and marinated my chicken strips for a couple hours in a bit of olive oil, lemon, fresh garlic, oregano and the garam masala.  We grilled these on the grill and heated the pita on there too.  Added the sauce and they were delicious.  I've never had them with a pickle, but my son thought that was a super idea.  Great summer dish and I added a side of Tabouleh salad as a cool salad sticking to the Middle Eastern theme.  Thanks for submitting - one could do alot with this dish to make it the way they like it.  Thanks for serving!",

I also seasoned the chicken with salt pepper and garlic powder (along w/ the garam masala) for extra flavor. I opted to use flatbreads because I felt it would hold up better, and I wasn't disappointed. I only had sliced pickles on hand, so I went with it. Oh, and the garlic mayo just put this over the top!  I really couldn't believe how these simple ingredients ended up being such a delicous sandwich...hubby was even impressed! I will definately be making these again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Instead of placing the pita bread flat then piling the ingredients on top folding and serving I placed my Toufayan Pita rounds between two damp paper towels and placed in the microwave for less than a minute. Removed from the microwave laid the rounds flat and cut in half making two halves. I then took my fingers and lifted the cut edges up to form the pita pockets no tears in the pita bread and no mess when enjoying the ingredients inside the pocket. I used McCormicks Gourmet Collection Master Blends Garam Masala and Mt. Olive Deli Style Kosher Dill Relish made with sea salt. Mrs. J another Buzz Recipe Group participant suggested the minced garlic be combined with honey to alleviate the skunky taste\" of the garlic and I followed her suggestion which was spot on. We enjoyed the Chicken Shawarmas and will be making again. Thank you for sharing your easy quick and tasty recipe Luke Summers. Recipe Group Selection on June 7 2014.",

The ingredients are so simple that I was honestly surprised at how great it turned out. I am kind of wishing that I had doubled the recipe now so that we could have more leftovers for tomorrow but I will just have to make this again soon. I was leery about the pickles but I really think that this would taste kind of plain if they weren't in it. So good! With as much as we liked this we will probably be making this every week and that is not like me at all. Thank you for this fabulous recipe Luke!",
