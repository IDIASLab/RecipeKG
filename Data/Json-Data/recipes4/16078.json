But the overall flavor of the dish was great, so I can say for sure I will make again, but will add at least another pound of stew meat. It sure was different and delicious. You could totally add veggies to this to make it chunkier.",

                "reviewBody": "This \"Egyptian Lahma Bil Basal (Beef in Rich Onion Sauce)\" recipe was very good but not so spicy (as would be obvious from the list of ingredients). I ended up throwing in 4 extra bay leaves because I am quite used to eating highly-spiced food and the flavor of this stew was so mild. I wanted an authentic dish so I resisted adding any other seasoning (not even salt or pepper) until I was done. My meat was very tender after 2.5 hours of cooking on low so I removed it from the onion broth while I turned up the heat to reduce it to a thick onion gravy and this process significantly improved its flavor. Much to my surprise the onion gravy became much sweeter and more delicious after resting for a few hours waiting for suppertime. I decided to spice up our supper by sprinkling it with Egyptian Dukkah (Allrecipes.com rosichops). The DukKah contains salt and pepper (as well as hazelnuts sesame seeds coriander and cumin) so I did not add any salt and pepper to the stew. With the Dukkah topping we really enjoyed this recipe. Thank you Chaka for introducing us to Lahma Bil Basal.",

This was perfect for something different and I think better than the traditional stew. I followed the recipe and I like it as is. Now with that said I screwed up the recipe. I didn't read that it should have been 4 onions until it was nearly done. I only used 1. It needed the other 3. So that's why I say I like it as is. Last note I did let it simmer for nearly 4.5 hours. The beef stayed pretty true to its original form until the last 20 minutes or so of simmering. And then suddenly it fell apart and was amazingly tender.",
