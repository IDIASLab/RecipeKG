The eggplant was either overdry and tough or gooey.  In either case, it stood out and didn't \"pass\" as well for pasta.\n\nI prefer to peel the eggplant and slice it lengthwise into strips the approximate width of a lasagna noodle.  Start with the strips a little wider than the size you wish them to be, as they will shrink in the over. \n\nOther than using eggplant instead of noodles, you can follow your own lasagna recipe.  I like to mix thawed, chopped frozen spinach (which has been COMPLETELY drained and squeezed dry) into ricotta (or cottage) cheese, along with an egg and some shredded parmesan, to use as one of the layers.   I also like using Sargento's 6-cheese Italian better than straight mozzarella.  Less stringy and more depth of flavor.",

I coated the eggplant slices (sliced vertically) with the egg/water mixture and dipped them in ground pecans and parmesan instead of the breadcrumbs. I have been using ground pecans and parmesan to bread chicken and fish as well. Pecans remain crisp and lend a nice crunchy texture and good taste. I also used bottled spaghetti sauce and seasoned the beef with 1 tsp. each of salt, fennel seed, and red pepper flakes along with a pinch of ground black pepper. The fennel gives the beef an Italian sausage flavor.  In the lasagna layers I added a layer of ricotta mixed with one egg.  The result was wonderful and gluten free.",
