This seal makes the potatoes cook to perfection (thank you mom for that tip).  We also get a very spicy polish sausage, and sometimes add Old Bay or Seasoning salt versus the lemon pepper.  It's just one of those wholesome filling meals you don't have to mess with on busy weeknights. ;)  Cheers - Cat",

I use a large bag of frozen mixed vegetables, then added a head of broccoli cut into florets. Then for more flavor I added a half a pkg. of Lipton '\"recipe Secrets\" vegetable flavor.I added the sliced Polish sausage,I then baked it covered tightly for 50 min. Then opened it up and added a cup of sharp shredded chedder cheese. Put back in oven until cheese melted. Great!!",

I diced the potatoes really small, and they were still hard after cooking the entire time dictated.  I even had to boil it for awhile before the potatoes were edible.  Maybe it was my potatoes.  I might try it again because it was pretty easy and tasted fine, but I'll be sure to cook potatoes first.",

Like other readers, I used turkey sausage (I like Hillshire Smoked Turkey Sausage, it's peppery) and a bag of frozen spring vegetables (peppers, squash, asparagus, etc).  My DH and I love onions, so I went ahead and browned the turkey sausage and onions in a skillet first. I diced 4 small red potatoes, only used 2 tbsp butter and sprinkled Mrs Dash on top. Didn't have any cheddar cheese, but had about 1 cup of colby/jack.  Thank you for a great dinner recipe!!",
