                "reviewBody": "Ok, my thoughts: 1) Ketchup? Sounded gross but turned out to be a nice addition to the flavor. 2) Needed more honey for my taste, but that's personal preferrence. 3) Sesame oil: you don't need it if you don't have it, but what starts out as overpowering really mellows and adds to the flavor as you cook it. I didn't have fresh ginger so I added ground ginger to the sauce. I added different veggies (see my photos) but you really can throw in anything you like. For prepping, rather than stir fry the veggies, then add the sauce and shrimp and let everything get soggy while trying to cook the shrimp, I did the following: make the sauce to taste earlier in the day. (Flavors get better the longer they sit). I only used 1.5 tsp corn starch, which gave the perfect thickness to the sauce. Toss the shrimp in to marinate. If it's not cooked, cook it, then toss it in. Later, as you are stir frying your veggies, re-heat the sauce/shrimp separately. When the veggies are done (about 5 minutes) toss in the shrimp/sauce mixture, quickly stir and put into bowls. This keeps the veggies from boiling in the sauce and getting soggy. I had already cooked brown rice and just added the stir fry to that. IMHO, the amount of liquid from the recipe was perfect for 2. I would make more if you have more than 2-3 people. Overall a very good dish and I would certainly make it again. Thanks Coastiewife!",
