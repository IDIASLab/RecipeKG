It's just a no-brainer to turn the carcass into stock the next day and is very economical.  I roast the chicken on a bed of mirepoix (onion, carrot, celery...rough chop), and strain a cup of white wine through the veggies after the chicken is roasted, then make an \"au jus\" type of pan gravy with the pan drippings.  Any of those leftovers can be used to make the stock the next day.  Truly, the chicken being roasted beforehand makes ALL the difference in the depth and richness of flavor in the chicken stock.  It usually does need to be refrigerated overnight so it can be de-fatted, reheated, then strained through cheesecloth at least 3 times to clarify the broth.  Trust me, that step is worth the effort for a clear, golden broth!  Then make chicken noodle or turkey rice soup with the stock.  Wonderful, warming, healing soup!  Definitely ADD FRESH DILL for the finished soup, and I find the juice of one lemon really brightens the flavor, and has an added punch of vitamin C too!  Also, don't salt the broth...wait till you assemble the finished soup and taste to see how much salt it needs, if any.  Use a light hand!",

(plus, I think it's more easier & healthier to toss them all together then have to cook them in oil)Leave the wonderful caramelized juices that are a result of roasting the ingredients on the pan and  put the roasting pan on your stove top and add some of the water and scrape any brown bits of chicken or vegetables that may be stuck to the bottom of the pan and mix them into the rest of the water in the stock pot.  For the seasonings I made a  sachet and adding the ingredients in some cheese cloth that you tie up with a string and discard after.  I did use and put 2 bay leaves in the sachet and fresh herbs instead of dried.  THX.  It's so worth the time saving, collecting and freezing the bones untill I had enough to make this broth.  ",
