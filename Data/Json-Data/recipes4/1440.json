Instead of peanut butter I used sliced turkey breast. And instead of jelly I subsituted with cheddar cheese. But I wanted to stay with the original recipe so I spread the outside pieces with some butter and grilled it in a pan. When I took them off the pan and took a bite I knew I had to thank the brilliant cook who sent this wonderful recipe. Thank goodness you are a contributor to allrecipes. My family loved it and I'll be making this at least once a week.",

It doesn't require butter because it actually toasts the sandwich.  It melts the peanut butter and jelly and tastes so good that you won't notice that there isn't any type of butter on the outside.

When one is a peanut butter junkie and is also trying to diet, one should never, ever read any kind of review that contains this creamy indulgence. My first mistake was reading the recipe itself when I came across it. My second mistake was then reading the reviews! Up until then it was \"do I, or don't I\"? Thanks to \"MC MA of 3's\" review (the woman's a bad influence on me) I just couldn't resist! Before I knew it, I was in the kitchen grilling this baby up. I must say though, that after inhaling it, I felt absolutely no remorse! Chastity, I don't know whether to thank you or not for submitting this amazing little sandwich recipe because now I know I'll never get back to my diet! DELICIOUS!!!!",

So the class, as I suspected, was boring (but fun) for me. We made some pretty basic recipes, none of them particularly memorable. But it speaks volumes that this simple twist on a basic PB&J sandwich left such an impression on me after all these years. I will NEVER forget that first bite...
