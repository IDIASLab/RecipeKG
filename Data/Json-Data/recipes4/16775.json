                "reviewBody": "Goulash (or often called chili macs in my house) is something that I typically throw together without a recipe, since I've made it so many times.  The addition of the bay leaves, worcestershire sauce, and sofrito (I made my own and always have this in the freezer) were several ingredients that I typically don't include, but I liked the new layers of flavor that they bring.  I followed the recipe with the exception of scaling back the seasoned salt.  One thing in particular I like about this recipe is that you cook your macaroni in the goulash mixture, so you're saving yourself one more pan to wash.  Just watch your time on this step, as the macaroni will absorb the liquid pretty quickly, and you may need to add a little more water (I did).  The one seasoning I missed was chili powder, but that's my own personal taste that I know many don't include in goulash.   This is just good old-fashioned comfort food.  Thanks Dawn Bohler.",
