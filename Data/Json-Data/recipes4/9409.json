What I did prior to adding to the cornstarch mixture is I seasoned it with more of the curry cumin parika and added a bit of red pepper to heat it up. What I love so much about this recipe is that it allows room to play with the seasonings. Some people don't want all the heat and spice and prefer the recipe as is so it's perfect. Others have a great base to work with and can play around with the flavor quite a bit. This is a versatile easy and delicious meal for anyone all you need to do is dip your spoon in take a little taste and add whatever else you might need to make it perfect for you!",

To release flavor spices need to be fried for a couple of minutes so when onion/garlic were soft I added spices and fried for 2 minutes before adding remaining ingredients. I only made this for 2 people but still used recommended amount of spices but 1 Tbs soy-sauce (for 8 I would at least triple the spices). By using coconut cream instead of milk (140ml can for 2 people) there was no need to add water/cornstarch. Will do again but use more spice - may also be good using cashews instead of pine-nuts.",

I omitted the cornstarch as I don't need the extra carbs or care if it was thickened (that would also make it bland-er). Also added brocolli tops the last few minutes for a quick low-carb meal. It was VERY GOOD. Fried rice would of been wonderful with some of the sauce but we are eating only the healthier carbs. Will definitely make again with the changes and will add more vegetables (matchstick carrots bok- choy snow peas etc.) when we are using more carbs. Thank you William my Thai restaurant's not going to see me or my as often (when I can make this quick and easy at home)!",

After I read what was actually in this red curry blend (coriander cumin chili pepper red pepper and cardomom) at least the McCormicks brand I thought I might be ok. The cornstarch would have added a nice thickening to it but I was ok I just added about 1/4 cup whipping cream. Let me tell you... this was DELISH! AND my husband who doesn't like coconut was ready to gobble this dish up.
