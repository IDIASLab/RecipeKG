So just mix just until incorporated. This dough is also very good in pot pies. You can cut out large sized cookie rounds bake them and top off a stew or soup of your choice. I make these ahead of time and freeze them. It keeps the calories down and you don't have soggy dough in the bottom of the bowl.",
