The result is a nice \"pan pizza\" like crust - GUILT FREE!  I agree wholeheartedly with the recommendations to pre-cook at 350 for 15 minutes or more (depending on thickness) and then add toppings and cook again.  My husband kept \"oohing\" and \"ahhing\" about the crust.  I think the honey really makes it.  For those of you who mentioned it was tough - perhaps you kneeded it too much.  You want to mix with greased hands just until the ingredients are incorporated.  We made individual pizzas which was really fun for the kids (ok - and me and hubby too!)",

Then I covered the dough and stashed it in the fridge all day.  I took it out of the fridge an hour before I wanted to use it to warm it up.  Cut it into 4 pieces and rolled it onto parchment, brushed with a touch of olive oil, and baked on a pizza stone at 450 degrees for 3 minutes or so.  Then took it out, put some pesto, cheese, tomatoes, and whatever else.  Fresh cracked pepper on top, and back on the stone for 4-5 minutes or until the cheese was melty. \n\nI will never make white pizza dough again....this was so incredibly good!

I really like that it has wheat germ and honey in it instead of oil and sugar. Prepared the dough in my breadmaker which allows it to rise for an hour, then pressed it into a medium size pizza pan sprayed with canola oil. Let rest for 15 mins and then precooked in 425 oven for 2 minutes before adding all the other toppings. Turned out great, crunchy on the outside and chewy inside!!",

I floured my pizza stone a little and used a thin spatula to loosen the dough off the stone after the first 17 minutes. It came out DELICIOUS! I had actually kneaded the dough and let it rise longer because I had the time. My only complaint is that it wasn't very crispy on the bottom but this was my first time using a pizza stone so I think I'll just have to practice.;) All in all the dough was VERY tasty VERY quick and a GREAT healthy alternative to regular pizza dough!",

It was a little softer than we like (we like crisp crust) but such a great flavor and we can adjust to the softness because it is sooo much better for us than jiffy pizza crust! Very easy to make. I did a few things differently. After I let the dough rise for 10 minutes in a warm oven then I kneaded it for a few minutes on a lightly floured surface. I greased the pizza pans and my hands with cooking spray and pressed the dough onto the pans. Very easy! I let the crust rest for 10 minutes then poked holes and baked for 4.5 minutes @ 425 degrees. Added toppings and baked for 11 minutes @ 425 degrees. Great recipe thank you!",

BIG mistake... make sure you grease the pan before spreading the dough on it. Also the dough was way too sticky to spread - so I had to use quite a bit of extra flour to make it workable (next time I'll cut down on the water).
