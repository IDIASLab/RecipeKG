No worries with this one.  I chose to use canadian bacon as my protein and added diced onion and yellow red peppers.  As I was preparing it, I had leftover Russian Cheese Salad (mozz/mayo/garlic) from this site, so I added that as well, and I'm glad I did.  The garlic really made this sing.  This is easily customizable and came together in mere minutes.  It's not the most visually appealing if you're looking to impress with presentation, but it was really nice not having to preheat the oven and wait an hour for a traditional breakfast casserole to cook.  This will be one of my staple overnight guest breakfasts.  THANKS for the recipe!",

The air whipped into it made the final result more than 2\" high in a standard oval crockpot. This kept in the moisture very well. The sausage moved up to just under the cheese crust and it was yummy. \n\nI might try the sausage in uncooked so those oils go into the hash browns. \n\nCould try peppers or other veggies mixed in with the hash browns",

I then cooked up plain pork sausage. I added fresh garlic while cooking the sausage and some maple syrup. I didn't drain all the grease off for flavor. I topped the hash browns and sausage in the crockpot with leftover Thanksgiving ham. Next added extra cheddar cheese since we are cheese lovers. Last I sprinkled real bacon bits all over before cooking. The family loved it and said it was a keeper recipe!",
