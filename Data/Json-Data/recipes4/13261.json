I used more tomato sauce b/c I only had a larger can maybe around 12 oz. instead of 8 oz. added a bit more mustard red pepper and a squirt of ketchup. I simmered much longer so the additional liquid was used up and broke up the meat very fine using the \"P Chef\" \"Mix & Chop\" (my fav tool for ground beef). Served with Smith's hot dogs and used as a topping for baked steak fries. Delicious! Wish my waistline would allow me to eat like this everyday!",

Took some greek dogs to work today to see how the guys liked it...the only thing they said would make it better was a beer with the greek dogs. I have to agree. This will also work well to make your own meat for Tacos or sloppy joes. Thanks Miz...",

After I fixed a dog though it reminded me of the many Greek Dogs I used to eat as a 6th-7th grader from the Greek restaurant down the street from our apartment. This is what I did: I put a hot dog on a bun topped it with the sauce sprinkled on some diced sweet onion squirted a line of mustard wrapped the whole thing up in some wax paper let it sit for a few minutes unwrapped it and enjoyed. It smelled and tasted just like the hot dogs I used to buy from the Greeks. As for the recipe I mashed the meat up a bit finer as it was cooking. Because I accidentally used about a half a pound more meat than called for the liquid started to evaporate. I fixed this by adding a little water and powdered beef bullion. Thanks!",

I cut the red pepper down to a quarter of the original amount and used beef broth instead of water since I had it to use up. I added the broth right from the start along with the beef and this gave the meat the perfect fine crumbled texture. That's my secret way to get the fine texture and works better than a potato masher or food processor. Thanks while this was a good sauce we are still searching for the perfect greek coney sauce.
