Seasoning the chicken before they go in the oven is key.  I use, cayenne pepper, tex mex seasoning, montreal steak spice, salt & pepper and chinese five spice seasoning.  Make sure you add these spices to both sides of the wings, and oven bake these babies.  Make sure the sauce you've made and chicken wings are both hot when you mix together.  No regrets here, and no wings are either.  Happy New Year!!!",

I found this video by Chef John & made them off the video directions, replaying it several times to get the gist. (2nd time see recipe) In the sauce, I also added his suggested 2 finely chopped/ mashed garlic cloves. That\u2019s the easy part! (15 minutes? Make sauce after wings are baked.)\n         I bought two, 4-lb bags of Wayne Farms frozen Wingettes (no tips). [8 lbs made 40 pieces] Thawed. Washed, cut off extra skin, seasoned & floured (30 min). Baked to very crisp in the oven, a 1 & a1/2 hr process @ 450 degrees, turning often.\n          One thing I did was to place them small bunches, from oven to stove-top simmering sauce for 5 minutes. These few minutes soaked sauce into wings and I think was key to their infused, succulence. Arranged into two 7X12 Pyrex dishes so they could be warmed separately. Provided a water bowl with cut lemon for 'finger-dipping...\"\n           A chef was present at party who caters & owns a popular deli. She took a photo & emailed her boyfriend that he was missing \u201cthe best wings she'd ever had!\u201d  [Helpful as I had no comparison]\n          Now when making second time, I see that I didn't have to 'glub-guess\u2019 the recipe from video! Hope they turn out as good as my 1st guesstimate.\n         Wings were spicy & sweet-- but not too sweet. Absolutely delicious. Now, I will notice wings at parties & doubt any will compare.",

Then I made this sauce and tossed the wings. I made it basically EXACTLY as stated except used half the amount of sriracha- for the kids sake (but we had a bottle at the table for us). This is a really great recipe! I looked at it in the pan and thought it did not look like much so I doubled it. MISTAKE. A little goes a long way of this stuff! Oh well I will just use the leftovers for a slow cooker meal I think. (shredded orange chicken breast anyone??) Seriously finger lickin' deliciousness.",

(By the way the video and the recipe on his website calls for a TEASPOON of soy sauce not a tablespoon.) If your Asian chili pepper sauce has a lot of salt like mine does you won't want to add the soy sauce. Chef John says in the video to use Sambal chili paste/sauce or any red chili sauce. I couldn't find Sambal so I used (red) chili garlic sauce which has quite a bit of salt. Because of that I left the soy sauce out and it was good. He also recommends you add a couple of cloves of smashed or finely minced garlic which was already in my chili garlic sauce. I think next time I'll try halving the hoisin sauce to let the orange flavor take center stage a little more. It was very good though and I used it on baked chicken drumsticks. It would be even better on wings and it would be great on breaded chicken bites and steamed broccoli over rice (for restaurant-style orange chicken).",
