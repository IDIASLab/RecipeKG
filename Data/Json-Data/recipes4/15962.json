I allowed the chicken to marinate in the buttermilk all afternoon.  To assemble, I skipped the water and just used beaten egg when coating the chicken.  I didn\u2019t want to risk losing my breading when flipping them, but I also didn\u2019t want the underside to get soggy, so I just coated the top side of the chicken with the flour mixture, then egg, and then the stuffing crumbs.  I also drizzled a little melted butter over the top for a little extra flavor.  That all worked out just fine.  I didn\u2019t lose my breading and it was nice and crisp, and not soggy on the bottom.  My chicken was perfectly done and still moist in 25 minutes.  I\u2019ll make this again with my changes.",
