I used grated carrot that I already had instead of chopping more - and I liked the texture it gave to the soup. I also used fresh portobellos.

If you make the recipe for 12 servings you use a whole 14oz can of artichokes. Waste not want not. I will definitely add this too my constant rotation. I used white button shitake chantelle and fresh portabellos. When it called for the soaking water I used 2 cups of fresh water and it seemed that if I would have used more it would have been too watery. I hope this helps!
