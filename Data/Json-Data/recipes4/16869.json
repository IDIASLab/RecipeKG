Although the Mexican-style stewed tomatoes gives it a little kick, we do prefer our chili a little spicier. Next time I'd add some jalapenos and cayenne to the mix. I also made mine in my IP because it's too hot to turn on the stove. I topped it with shredded cheddar, sour cream, pickled jalapenos and hot sauce! Definitely a quick weeknight meal everyone will enjoy and most of the ingredients are probable already in your pantry.",
