I also added a few more spices and less salt because of the crackers.  Came out very nice.  Crunchy on the outside and tender on the in.  I will definitely be making these again.",

Used a little flour on some before dipping into the egg and that helped a little.  Also let then sit for a little while before cooking.  Next time I'll try crushing up the panko a little bit, for a smaller texture.  Made these in an Air Fryer.  Great way to enjoy cauliflower.  Thanks for the idea.",
