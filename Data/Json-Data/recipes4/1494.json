BBQ the sirloin rare and then thinly sliced it and set aside in preparation for assembly.  Carmelized the onions prior to making the sandwiches, then sauteed the peppers using green and red for color.  Added mushrooms for a more true Philly sandwich.  Used a variety of cheese; Manchego, Monterey and Mozarella.  My favorite was the Manchego which gave it an edge.  Baked the sandwiches open faced for 5 minutes to crisp the buns, then broiled until the cheese melted, bubbled and slightly browned.  The garlic mayo made the sandwich!  My family loved it.  Thanks Tera for the great recipe.",

Reheated leftovers in the oven, put in while heating to 500, when reached 500 took out, perfect. Micorwaved leftover sandwiches were not so good.",

I've wanted to try making Philly cheesesteak sandwiches for literally years and finally was brave enough to try them tonight.  I used provolone instead of mozarella because I bought provolone thinking that was what I was supposed to have.  I also used a red pepper in place of a green pepper because I prefer the sweeter taste.  My changes didn't make this recipe though, the recipe itself made the recipe.  Soooooo delicious.  I will definitely make this again.  Served with the baked french fries from this web site.",
