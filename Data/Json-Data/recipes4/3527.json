I prepared it exactly as described and marinated it for 3 1/2 hours- ample time for the flavors to delevop according to the recipe guidelines. I LOVE garlic & I LOVE beer so this sounded terrific! I was actually rather disappointed. The beer flavor was very subtle and I used a fairly robust brew. The garlic was nice but I'd have increased it a bit if I'd known how flat (no pun intended!) the overall dish would be. It was alright certainly edible. We were planning to eat these as an appetizer. I also prepared an old standby recipe that evening (shrimp skewered with bacon & marinated in teriyaki sauce then grilled) and those were a HUGE hit! The beer shrimp sadly languished on the plate... They might be better as part of a dish like in shrimp tacos with other zippy ingredients. I really wanted to like these! So simple and two of my favorite flavors. Just not anything remarkable according to the friends we served them to.",

So delicious and so simple! The only thing I did different was sprinkle them with a little garlic salt right before they went on the grill as I hadn't marinated quite two hours and was afraid the garlic flavor hadn't infused. Make sure you use a beer you like cause the beer flavor is really prevalent. This recipe has me wondering what else I can marinate in beer and garlic cause the flavor combo is amazing!! Thanks so much Gale!",
