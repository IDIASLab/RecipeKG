I cooked the meat in the soup pot and seasoned it with pepper minced garlic and Worcestershire sauce. I didn't drain the meat just followed the directions from the beginning. The second time I made this I left out the meat altogether. For the veggies I used 6 instead of 4 potatoes 16 oz frozen broccoli cuts and two bags of the blend called for in the recipe. Added half of the frozen veggies with the potatoes and the other half with the canned soups and cheese. This allowed some of the vegetables to melt into the background but you still have some cooked only slightly which gave some bulk to the soup. I must admit I loved this soup both ways I made it. I'll be making this again for sure:)!!!",

I substituted cream of broccoli for the cream of celery (because I had it)and I also added carrots green beans and corn as well as the cauliflower mix.

I did add the noodles about an hour before eating and the cheese just before serving.",
