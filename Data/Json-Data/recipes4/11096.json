For the base, I used two 32oz containers of low-sodium chicken broth, clam juice (look for it in the international foods aisle or near the tomato sauce), one 28oz container of crushed tomatoes, and the sauteed garlic and green pepper (I substituted the green onions with onion powder). Use the spices liberally and to your taste (you can't really measure herbs) but don't add salt until you've tasted it. Clam juice is REALLY salty. I let the base simmer for about 30 minutes, then I added one pound of shrimp, two containers of lump crab meat, and a pound of tilapia. I cooked it for another 5 or 10 minutes, then shut it off. You can even remove the soup from the heat, then add the seafood. The heat from the mixture will cook it. It's so good by itself, I didn't add the rice. It's great as is!",

I'm by no means an \"expert\", but from my experience, this is fantastic!!  I have been taught that anytime you're using green bell pepper, you might as well toss in some celery, so I added about 1/4 cup of that.  I also used 3 cloves garlic (not so much cuz it's a cajun thing to do, as it is i LOVE garlic!) and added a 10 oz. can of clams and an 8 oz can of oysters.  Also upped the amount of rice to 1 cup.  I've already eaten 2 servings and contemplating another as we speak...will definitley make again!!  :)  (Oh, may up the butter to 2 T next time though, cuz my garlic was burning before the rest of the veggies were done)",

I took the heads off the prawns and boiled them till the water turned an orange color (from the row).   I then strained it to collect the soup, which is very flavorful because of the the prawn row in it.  I used this instead of water and clam juice.  I also added scallops and clams, so it ended up being a very hearty soup loaded with seafood.  Served to friends at lunch and everybody got seconds.",

I made two substitutions with items I had on hand: Used a 28 oz. can (3 1/2 cups)of diced tomatoes in place of the 3 cups of vegetable juice to make a thicker consistency (left out the 1/2 cup of water). Also substituted Tarragon when I discovered I was out of Thyme. What a great and interesting flavor! I love that this is a very low fat soup too. Good job Eddie!",
