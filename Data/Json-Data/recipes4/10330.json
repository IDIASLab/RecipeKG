I think this would make a great cold salad too the next day - as if there would BE any leftovers! LOL XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Made this a few times now. The 2nd time I made it I cooked the veggies well enough to omit the baking stage. I dried out the dish too much and is really not necessary. Once the veggies were ALMOST cooked through I added the boiling water and the couscous. I used the \"ready in 5 minutes\" kind. I added the cheese just prior to serving. It came out moist and used less dishes! I continue to make it this way and YES it makes a nice cold lunch \"salad\" the next day.",

I used chicken stock instead of water, omitted the red pepper, cut back on the oil and didn't use salt or pepper and it was great. I made it up to the oven part ahead a little bit and then popped it in the oven 20 before the rest of dinner was ready. I served this with Feta-Stuffed Chicken. It was a wonderful compliment since both recipes have fresh basil. Speaking of basil, I julienned it for this recipe.",
