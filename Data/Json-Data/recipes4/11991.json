There was plenty of spice using just half the recommended amount of cayenne; still spicy but not peeling the skin off your tongue. Cut the salt way back except for a little seasoned salt; we don't like a lot of salt and usually sausage is a little salty anyway. Added a teaspoon of garlic powder (to make up for omitting the garlic salt). Used frozen mixed vegatables (\"fiesta mix\" which included beans). Omitted the butter (didn't seem to need it). We LOVED it. Topping it with sour cream added a nice touch. Definitely make again.",

The only thing I would change next time is to cut back on the salt because even my salt-aholic husband's first comment was...\"Wow this is salty. Maybe even too salty.\" I definitely thought it was too salty and will cut back next time. I'll probably cut back on the cayenne a little too because it was super hot-spicy. But hey - I'm not complaining because the overall taste was AWESOME! A very comforting and tasty meal! Thanks for this quick easy and inexpensive dinner idea!",
