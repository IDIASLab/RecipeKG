And since they are more the picky eaters in the house, I tried it on them 1st. The method of the steeping the fruit in tea was totally new to me and that's what drew me in to make this recipe. I used my Kuerig Vue, to brew 8 oz of Sweet Tea(it's rather stout and not very sweet at all). And my only dilemma was, that I tried locating some currants but couldn't find any available. I recieved some help from members of AR that have eaten currants to help with the flavor to sub with. I chose to sub with a half and half with regular raisins & cranberries. Kept the golden raisins the same. The whole recipe process was very easy. I even followed the parchment paper in the loaf pan. And had the correct sugar on hand as well, which is bakers sugar or sugar in the raw brand of sugar. This recipe totally will be made again. The sweetness from the tea and fruit were a surprise and it really is a nice change to regular raisin bread. It's very dense, like a soda bread. However, I loved the sweet & tart raisin taste, even the crust of the bread was nicely sweet. You have to try it least once. I'll make again, and can see using other fruit combinations as well. TY very much.",

Don't over steep your tea, but do make it nice and strong to carry the flavor. \nI've done the recipe just as is and it comes out great.

My family likes the tea flavor which adds the moisture to the bread. I typically brew 2 to 3 tea bags and let the tea cool before adding the raisins and currents.",
