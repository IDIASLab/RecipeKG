It will look very dry and crumbly, but, keep working with it and it will come together into a smooth ball.  Make sure you don't see any of the dry Bisquick.  I only used about 1-1/2 lbs of sausage and about 1-1/2 cups of Bisquick.  My oven cooks hot - so, I also baked at 350 for 20 minutes instead of 400 and they were perfect.  I also baked them on a parchment covered baking sheet and they came right off the paper. Thanks, Mitchell!",

I always add more cheese because well, CHEESE!! I add 2 tsp. baking powder as well. This really makes them puff up. I also use 1/2 Cup of water, otherwise they're a little dry. One more thing I'd like to add is that I grate my own cheese. When you buy the pre-grated cheese they put some drying chemicals on it so the cheese won't stick together. That dries out the sausage balls. Just grate your own, you'll not be sorry you did. These sausage balls are SO much better when you do it yourself.",

So I guess it's 5 balls = 1 serving?\n\nThe sausage I used was 1 lb Great Value brand mild pork sausage (in the chub) + 4 links (about .8 lbs) of Great Value mild Italian pork sausage. I didn't have sharp cheddar, so I used medium cheddar (Tillamook) and grated a little over half of my full pound brick. (a little extra cheese to make up for the too little sausage).  A full 2 cups of regular bisquick.   It made 62 balls for me. Baked at 400 for 17 minutes on parchment paper lined pans. These produce a fair amount of oil/grease, so best to use a fully rimmed pan to prevent spills when taking out of the oven. \n\nThe flavor was great, though mild. Perfect for the kid and parent crowd at my party tomorrow, though sophisticated palettes will appreciate using the hot sausage and sharp cheddar IMHO.",

I was surprised when I made them I thought when I made 1.5\" balls that they would shrink a little but they turned out huge! I didn't add anything to spice it up since it called for hot sausage but the ones I picked out were overpoweringly spicy. It would be better to refine this recipe using mild sausage and a measure of complimentary spices. I also used the 8 ounces of sharp cheddar as called for but it didn't come through in the finished product very well especially against the spice and Bisquick. Both my brother and I tried these (incidentally he works at McDonalds) and even though I did not tell him there was bisquick in these he said \"I handle a lot of sausage and pancakes every morning and that's what this tastes like but spicier.\" He then broke out the maple syrup and dipped them in it and that's when it became clear: this is not a great party food or a great starter or app but it IS decent as a breakfast item. If you want a good party version of this I would use more cheese a lot less bisquick and melt some cheese over the top of the balls at the end. Also they should be closer to 1\" in diameter. If you keep them as is they might be good as part of some kind of breakfast meatball sandwich!",
