I have the minced garlic in a jar so I just plopped some of it into the bowl without measuring. I'm sure I used more than three cloves' worth but we really like garlic! Twenty minutes was the perfect amount of time to roast this. The broccoflower was tender but still had a bit of a snap to it. This went perfectly with my pot roast and salt and herb crusted roasted baby potatoes.",

I used a very aged balsmic vinegar that is thick and sweeter than the cheaper kind and makes all the difference I think. Used cooking parchment instead of foil on the cookie tray (more environmentally friendly). Yummy and sweet. It's nothing like boiled or steamed. Can't go back now. Thank you.",
