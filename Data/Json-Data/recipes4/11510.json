I halved the recipe but more or less estimated on the amounts of vegetables. I used a couple dried shiitake mushrooms (I had my biggest one simmer in the pot) and regular white button mushrooms. As far as bouillion goes three cubes of beef and three cubes of chicken bouillions were PERFECT. Add a chopped green onion or two and a couple dashes of black pepper- and it's heaven. Granted I hated waiting the 45 minutes for the soup to reduce but it was definitely worth it.",

I just got some white sliced mushrooms from the produce section without checking their type, and poured the broth over those with some sliced green onions and french fried onions.

And for him to say that with my complete lack of cooking skills it is a pretty big compliment. I even brought some to work the next day and it tasted freshly made. We will definitely be making this again! Our changes: We don't eat mushrooms so none were included. Instead of fresh ginger root we used ground ginger from the seasoning isle. Instead of chicken stock we used 3 chicken bouillon cubes. And we added an extra teaspoon of beef bouillon making it 4 tsp of beef bouillon. We used a cup of the soup and all of the vegetables to make our fried rice so that nothing was wasted.",
