Didn't bother with trying to julienne carrots, just chopped into small, somewhat flat, bits.  Peeled the zucchini and did the same thing. Also sauteed chopped 1/2 onion with it.  I don't know what fried onions are so I put a layer of crumbled potato chips on top instead which Hubby loved.  I loved all the vegetables.  I had planned to add canned mushrooms and forgot.  Definitely would have added even more to the dish.  Will also add a dash of pepper next time too -- personal taste.  Great recipe.  Will be making this often.",

Also, add 1/2 c. reduced fat sour cream and 1/2 c. milk to the mushroom soup & tuna mixture.  This was a huge hit & the vegetables made it even better! Will definitely make again and again!  \n\nOne note:  I didn't add green & red pepper 'cuz my family doesn't like them. Also, I only had three 3 pieces of string cheese to use for the mozzarella. So I shredded those & it was fine.  For pasta I used 8 oz. noodles.  I agree with othe reviewers that 12 oz. would have been too much. Thanks to the other reviewers for the tip on adding onion and mushrooms. ",

When sauteing the vegetables I added about a teaspoon of salt free all-purpose seasoning. I didn't have any French fried onions and used seasoned bread crumbs in stead. I think it turned out great the color added by the vegetables makes it a winner in my book!! Will definitely make this again.",
