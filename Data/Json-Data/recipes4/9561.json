Use plenty of flour when rolling out this dough. Served them to my potato-lovin' hubby & kids for dinner (there went about 30-40 ). Made some for the kids' lunch the next day (18-20 more) and then made enough for another dinner (another 30 ) and a few miscellaneous for another lunch -- they froze & reheated well after being boiled. The sour cream adds a delicious note to the dumpling dough and pairs well with the mashed potato/onion/cheddar cheese filling I used & just a simple brown butter sauce drizzled on top. With 3\" wrappers I used about teaspoon (little less) of filling. They sealed very easily with a fork but take note -- if you don't keep the rounds covered and the edges dry out even a teensy bit it will be difficult to seal them. Dough was toothsome and just the right texture. One of the best pierogi recipe I've tried & definately a keeper for our family -- thanks bunches!",

THe more the dough is worked with, the longer it is exposed to air causing it to become dry.  As it dries, it becomes increasinly tough and difficult to work with.  I think I used about 1 1/2 cups of water in the dough.  This makes a huge batch!  I only made half of the cheese-potato filling and I still have some leftover.  It took me about 3 hours to roll out, stuff, and seal these guys.  Oh, but it was worth it.  I've got a freezer full of pierogis, a quick and delicious meal any night!  I served them with caramelized onions and some sour cream.",

As far as how much warm water to use-I ended up using a little over a cup kneading this dough is definitely a great work-out for the upper body. I rolled the dough through my pasta maker on number 2 this helped me keep all of the pierogies uniform in shape. This recipe is definitely time consuming-between the dough and making the filling (we used the potato/cheese) but the time spent is worth it with the final results. The few that I did cook up tonight were delicious-I boiled them and then pan-fried them and then served them with carmelized onions and sour cream. Yum yum yum!
