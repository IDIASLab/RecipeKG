I didn't boil the peppers first and they were cooked perfect after 40 minutes in the oven, 25 minutes covered, 15 minutes uncovered at 400 degrees. Be sure to drizzle your baking dish with olive oil first.  I also added 1 can of diced tomatoes, 2 cloves of fresh chopped garlic, chili powder, and oregano for extra flavor. My husband loves cheese so I mixed some in with the meat and sprinkled more on top at the end.",

I just started working at a restaurant and have learned some new things, so I actually tweaked this: (1) Put the dried garlic in the rice water so that the rice is infused with the garlic flavor. (2)Don't boil the peppers, blanch them.  This keeps them from getting too discolored when you pre-cook them.  (Don't worry, they will still cook sufficiently in the oven.) (3) Add about 1/2 teaspoon coriander and cumin and then add cayenne pepper to taste after you add the tomato sauce.  This takes care of other reviewers complaints that there's not enough flavor, but as you cook this, taste it to make sure it is what you want in flavor.  ALWAYS TASTE AS YOU GO WHEN YOU COOK !!!!! \r\n(4)  These really only need about 30 minutes in the oven to get soft too, so don't overdo it.  I hope you find these comments helpful!

Much better taste. Also...when you par-boil something...the meat is already cooked..etc...it does not need to be in the oven for 45 minutes. That's big time over-kill. I baked mine for 20 minutes then added the cheese and melted it for 6 minutes. Keeps the peppers firmer.",

I made it again tonite but spiced up the meat mixture a little more with season salt and a good amount of garlic powder. I also used instant brown rice and it worked very well. I also poured a can of tomatoe soup (I mixed water with it as if I were making soup) in the bottom of the pan as it was cooking in the oven and it made for a really tasty sauce.
