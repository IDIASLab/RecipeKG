The recipe is adapted from a restaurant in the Mall of America called Tucci Benucch. I attended the restaurant at a business meeting and they gave us a recipe for the baked spaghetti that I have made a few changes to. My husband prefers it without the marinara/meatball topping, but if you're looking to stretch the recipe that's a great way to do it.",
