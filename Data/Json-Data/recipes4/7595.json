My husband tried to go back for a 3rd bowl but I put it up so we could have leftovers for the next day. If you like it a little thicker, stir a couple tablespoons of cornstarch into cold water and whisk into boiling soup for a couple minutes to thicken.  Personally, the sour cream, cheese and chips thickened it enough for me. Hubby went back for seconds so he ate it too quick to even notice. Top with blue corn tortilla chips, sour cream, and shredded Mexican-style cheese.",

We'll eat this again!\" I only used one can of fiesta-corn for the much needed color that this soup needed. (It could definitely benefit from some sauteed red bell peppers or something else w/ color.) I made it as directed using a Costco large can of Kirkland chicken instead of a rotisserie chicken making this ultra-easy to throw together. If I make it again though I would consider doubling the black beans or reducing the corn to an even smaller can b/c it's still a little corn-heavy. We didn't know what to think of the cream of chick soup going into it but it totally worked! Served w/ a sprinkle of grated cheddar and some crumble tortilla chips on top - yummo!",

Instead of Southwest corn I used a can of fire-roasted corn I had on-hand. I added two cans of black beans because we love black beans and one can really didn't look like enough for the amount of soup. I also sprinkled in about a half teaspoon or so of chipotle powder. I don't usually care for recipes that call for \"cream of...\" soups but I added the cream of chicken to the pot and it really helped to thicken it up so don't leave it out! I paired the soup with \"Golden Sweet Cornbread\" from this site. Everyone topped their soup with cheese sour cream and fresh cilantro. It was an excellent meal! This recipe is a keeper for me thanks for sharing it! Update: I've probably made this about 4 times now it's always a hit! Last time I added a few squirts of Sriracha sauce instead of Chipotle powder it's great either way but I think we all prefer the Sriracha.",
