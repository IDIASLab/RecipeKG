I added some dried cranberries after reading the other review and it definitely fits as an ingredient. Baked the filling separate for the first 30 minutes and then combined for the last 15. The apples still had a little crisp which added texture since the squash steamed itself so tender. I did rub olive oil on the inside of the squash and added salt and pepper before baking. Served with pork loin and kohlrabi but this squash turned out the star of the plate. I can't wait to start playing with other \"stuffing\" ideas for this. It has definitely made me a fan of acorn squash. Thanks for the great recipe!",
