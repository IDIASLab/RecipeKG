It is very hearty and dense...and I may try to add a bit more sugar and some gluten next time so it will rise a little higher...to use for sandwiches. This would also be terrific as mini-loaves baked free form (similar to what some of the steakhouse's serve). Tasted great toasted with honey too.

Also used all whole wheat pastry flour instead of whole wheat and all-purpose and ground flaxseed (not sure if that is any different from flax seed meal). It is a somewhat dense bread but it melts in your mouth; it's not dry at all. I had it with soup the night I made it and then the next morning I had it again as toast. Delicious! I will be making this one again. Thanks for the recipe!",
