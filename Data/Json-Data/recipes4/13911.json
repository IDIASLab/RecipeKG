So glad I did!!!  I did change a few things...I used fresh potatoes instead of canned.  I just made sure I cooked it long enough to ensure they were done.  I added about a teaspoon of chili powder and some garlic salt.  Next time I will only put about half the vinegar in.  This is totally wonderful!  I will be enjoying this leftover leftover turkey brunswick stew for many meals!",

First off I used a 4quart slow cooker 2hrs on high and 5hrs on low. Next, while making it, I felt like it had too much water. Instead of 6 cups I used only 2. I also added an extra 1/2cup bbq sauce. This made it thicker and more like stew than soup. Also I added 1 whole diced green pepper and 1 whole diced red pepper. I also just diced the onions and chucked them in the crock pot instead of cooking them first. I didn't use the food processor and it took about 30min to prepare. Very Very Very delicious. Will definitely cook again.",

So I changed a few things up. I used 'Hunts Fire Roasted Tomatoes' & 'Tomatoes w/Green Chilies & Garlic'. Also use Chicken Stock instead of water as well as Apple Cider Vinegar. I also use a half a bottle of the BBQ instead of 1/2 a cup & 1/8 of Worcestershire. Overall this recipe lead to a GREAT Brunswick Stew even If it was turkey.",
