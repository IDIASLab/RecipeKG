Left out the cilantro as I'm not a fan of its (soaplike) taste but just chopped enough flat-leaf parsley to compensate. The real surprise though is the fresh jalapeno especially when combined with the fiery cayenne and the smoky cumin. It's a trifecta of explosive flavor while the cuke mint and lemon provide the cooling effects. This is now my go-to summer salad thanks vburrito!",
