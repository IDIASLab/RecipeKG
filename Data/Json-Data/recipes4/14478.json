They were a little bit labor intensive, since I decided to make my own tortillas, but I think the flavor was fantastic because of it and they were worth it in the end! I ended up throwing in a pinch of sugar, a squirt of soy sauce, some ginger, onion, and cayenne pepper into the filling, and left out the egg. I will definitely make these again with my changes, since everyone loved them! Give them a try! The technique alone is worth it!",
