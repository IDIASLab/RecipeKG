I boiled the potatoes in chicken broth instead of water to add more flavour. I also threw in carrots and onions and raw farmer sausage at the same time and let it boil for 45 minutes. Added lots of dill and then pureed it in the blender as my kids don't like potatoes but will eat it this way. I added half and half cream only. Amazing flavour and my house smelled great. Definitly going to be a staple in my household this winter.",

It is almost the same but hers starts with browning mennonite or farmer sausage in the pan then drain the fat but keep the brown bits in the pan for flavor. She used to use fresh greens from her garden (nobody knows exactly what they were!) but I used fresh dill and parsley. She didn't use buttermilk either just half and half at serving time. This is a delicious hearty soup. My husband loves it (without half and half). My kids hated it the first time and loved it the second time can't wait to see how the third time goes tonight!",
