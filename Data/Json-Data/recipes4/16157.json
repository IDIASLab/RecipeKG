I looked up how to counteract that and ended up adding an equal amount of chili powder to the rice. I'm giving it 4 stars because it is a nice rice and not the submitter's fault that we ended up not being turmeric lovers. I do think with my change I would give it 5 stars. I only had frozen peas so that's what we used. I will make this one again. Thanks for sharing Mariposa",
