I couldn't find spicy turkey sausage but I did find regular and it tasted fine. I also used chicken thighs instead of turkey because I wrote down chicken thighs on my grocery list by mistake. Whoops! Anyway I only added 1/4 cup flour and had plenty. The only other change I made was to use two fresh tomatoes simply for the fact that they were about to go bad just sitting on my counter. This is a great comforting soup and I'm just betting it's even better tomorrow. Plus like I said it's really pretty! Definitely trying it over rice at work for lunch soon - yum!",
