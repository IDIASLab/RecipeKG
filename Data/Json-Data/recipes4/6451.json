These are the changes: used two cans of tuna instead of just one, and added half a bag of lightly cooked frozen peas and carrots. Used quarter cup milk at the start, but after stirring in the mushroom soup and tuna, only added 1/4 cup milk instead of the recipe's recommended half cup, plus a half-teaspoon of onion powder, quarter teaspoon of garlic powder, quarter teaspoon black pepper, tiny amount of cayenne, and a squirt of Dijon mustard.  Used a bit over a full cup of grated cheddar cheese on top after pouring into 2.5 quart baking dish.  Over the cheese spread half a cup of Panko bread crumbs which had been mixed with 1/2 teaspoon of dried dill; did not add the melted butter to this mix. Finally, added a good handful of French's onions before putting into the oven.  I've not made too many casseroles in my life, but have had enough of them to think that this recipe, when incorporating the changes above, is definitely a \"5\" or a \"keeper\".  Will definitely be making this recipe again.",

A lot of cheese on the top. Could double or triple the breading on the top - had to spread it with a spoon still didn't cover the entire top. This fed 5 adult eaters easily (none left for dad who was working) - so if you need more perhaps double. Baked uncovered in 3 qt dish for 25 minutes. Perfect!",

The kids (11 and 9) who don't like tuna casserole in general didn't complain. Reviews were mixed when I asked what they thought. One said it was good. The other said she didn't really like it. But like I said they don't usually like tuna casserole so this is a pretty decent review from them. I altered the recipe by mixing the dill into the noodle mixture instead of into the topping. I also mixed in 1/2tsp onion powder 1/4tsp garlic salt 1/4 tsp pepper 1/16tsp cayenne pepper. I thought the taste was really yummy. The breadcrumb topping didn't turn out as I would have liked. It was not crusty at the end of cooking. It was just oily. I sprinkled on more breadcrumbs and put it under the broiler for a few minutes. In the future I would probably use about 1/2 the butter in the topping. The cheddar cheese undoubtedly played a part in the oiliness too. After eating it I wonder how essential the cheese was. I think you might be able to reduce or remove the cheese with little impact to the taste. Alternatively it might be good to mix the cheese in with the general mixture. In spite of the negative things I've noted I would make it again. I'd likely tweak it as suggested though.",
