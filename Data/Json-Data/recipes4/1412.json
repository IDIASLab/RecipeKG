I like the idea another poster had, where she suggested applesauce and water (Probably a cup of each)poured on top instead of apple juice. Don't pay attention to the medium temp part (Can't imagine very many people have one like that); just use a thermometer. I had a three pound roast, and I went 4 hours on low. I decided it was done with a 150 degree standing temp. It was tender enough to cut with a plastic knife when eating (Hey, give me a break, I live alone.:-)). Only three stars because of the sauce, and the ridiculousness of a medium setting.",
