I also quadrupled the recipe, and used penne instead of shells.  I didn't use any of the cheese, but the tofu sure fooled everyone as ricotta!  Also, I sauteed zucchini slices and a portabello mushroom.  I decided to layer it like lasagna, with sauce on the bottom, a layer of noodles, some mushroom and zucchini chunks, then the tofu (used more), and then started over with the sauce.  I ended it with sauce on top and sprinkled chopped black olives all over the top.  Yum, yum, and quite healthy!!!  Next time I'll try it with lasagna noodles!",

I will definately be making his again. Thank You!",

Of course it's pretty hard to screw this one up and I owe alot of the credit to the makers of the particular spaghetti sauce I used-- the sauce is what determines the flavor of this dish so unless you use your own sauce recipe it's not really your success. I trippled the recipe to serve six and I used an entire 12.3 oz package of tofu-- 3/4 cup just wasn't enough. I used chopped portabellos since that's what we had for mushrooms and they tasted just fine. The dish holds together very nicely but it tasted a little funny when I microwaved the leftovers-- I don't recommend doing this if you use jarred sauce. Overall very good and I will probably make it again.",

Cooked al dente a must! Used good spaghetti sauce instead of tomato. Used portabello mushrooms since that's what I had. Increased amt. of tofu even a bit more.
