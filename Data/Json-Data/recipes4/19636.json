I found the Asian flavor a bit weak, so I did end up adding more soy sauce.  Would recommend that you mix your arrowroot into a slurry using a bit of water rather than adding it directly to the hot liquid after the cooking cycle is complete, otherwise, you\u2019ll most likely end up with lumps in your sauce.  Ended up with fork-tender, perfectly-cooked, flavorful beef.  Would suggest that you trim  off as much fat as you can because this is not something where you want fatty chunks of meat.  I served this with rice, but husband said he thought noodles would have been a better choice.  I\u2019m always looking for new Instant Pot\u00ae recipes, and this is one that I\u2019ll make again.  dlc1955dec, thanks for sharing your recipe.",
