Since we have cats we rolled smaller balls (marble sized) and cooked for 7 minutes. All 5 of our cats ate them with enthusiasm and my husband tried one (to be sure they were cooked through) and said they weren't bad. They make nice gifts for folks that have cats and dogs. One note: if you use broth make sure it does NOT have onion or garlic or similar seasonings in it; they are toxic for animals particularly for cats -- both can develop hemolytic anemia.",
