Used boneless chicken breast pieces instead of and substituted minced garlic for the garlic powder. Also added a little lemon juice as suggested in a review. Baked at 400 covered for 40 minutes, then added the carrots, red peppers, and onions; reduced heat to 350 and finished cooking (20 minutes) uncovered. Was delicious!! I am definitely going to make this again!",

My chicken was a bit dry...the breasts were thick so I butterflied them but it still took a while to get them cooked-maybe an extra 3 minutes but then it was too much. Next time I'll try to get actual 4 oz chicken breasts and maybe pound them a little first. Overall easy fast and good.",

Added yellow and red pepper strips to the carrots.  Used leftover small cooked red and white potatoes, just added them in at the first turning.  Based on comments, I was worried about it drying out.  But, without lemon juice in the house, I put a small glob of margarine atop each breast and everything turned out perfect!  Fabulous!  Will definitely make again, and sooo pleased to have chicken done so quickly!!!",

I used Italian Seasoning instead of the fresh rosemary thyme and sage because I didn't have it on hand. I sprinkled it over the breasts and veggies (of which I added sliced bell pepper and onions) while in the pan. Drizzled EVOO over all and sprinkled garlic salt and ground pepper. This is instead of inserting garlic into the chicken. Squeezed half a lemon over chicken. Placed pan about 8 inches from heat source cooked 10 min and then flipped chicken and seasoned the other side in same manner as the first side. Cooked an additional 12-16 minutes. They were thick breasts and I kept checking them with the instant therm. so I didn't overcook them. As soon as all four breasts read 165 I declared them done. My husband didn't even use any salt or pepper to season what he dipped up. Said it had great flavor already. A previous review said the seasoning slide off and left a bland flavorless chicken. That didn't happen to my dish in the slightest and the chicken was very moist not dry. Love Love how quick and easy this dish was to fix and cook.",
