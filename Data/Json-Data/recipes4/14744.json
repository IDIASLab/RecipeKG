Chili is forgiving that way. That being said, I didn't reduce anything, because we like it on the spicy side. I was in a huge hurry when I made this though, so instead of starting everything in the skillet, I threw everything straight into the slow cooker, including whole chicken breasts. Before serving, I shredded them in the pot. Also, after tasting, I decided that it needed a little something on the sweet side to cut the spicy a tad, so I added a can of corn, and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again, and I'm looking forward to lunch this week!",
