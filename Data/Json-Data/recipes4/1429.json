Drained the ribs and transfered to a shallow dish. After preparing the glaze I let it cool slightly and then poured over the ribs. Let the ribs marinate at least 2 hours I let mine marinate over night. Grilled them while frequently basting... it was soooo good. A little spicy for those with sensitive taste buds. My boyfriend loved the flavor but said they were too hot to eat as many as he wanted.",

It didn't flavor up the ribs as much as I thought it would so our ribs tasted as if we hadn't added any sauce at all.

I didn't use the full amount of honey for fear it would be too sweet. I was slightly under the called amount. I used spicy brown mustard because that is what I had on hand. I used a 1.5 teaspoon of cayenne. Seasoning was perfect. I did not bother adding 1/2 salt because the cajun seasoning can get pretty salty. I figured its easy to add than take out. I made the sauce in the am. Let ribs sit in it through the day. Threw them in the oven at 300 degrees for 3 hours give or take. I had them covered with foil and took it off last 45/30 mins. It made the sauce thick and great. My husband loved it and is asking for it again. I think this was a real winner and will be making this again.",

The only changes I made were that I substituted a chipotle seasoning blend for the cajun seasoning and reduced the red pepper flakes by about a tablespoon (because the chipotle stuff is pretty hot by itself). And I boiled the ribs for about 1 hr. let them cool for a bit and then covered them with the sauce and let them sit in the fridge overnight. The next day I baked them in a 300 degree oven for about 40 min. and then browned up both sides under the broiler while frequently basting them with more sauce. Mmmm the edges were all crispy and carmelized. It was a little spicy for my 8-yr. old though - she dipped hers in applesauce to cool it down a bit. The sauce is SO good that I'm going to try it on steak tips the next time.",

I also simmered the ribs for about 30 min. then let them marinate in the sauce for 1 hr before putting on the grill. They browned very fast (almost burned) so I ended up putting them in a covered casserole dish with the reserved sauce and slow cooked at 250 for 3 more hours. This was delicious and I will definately make the sauce again with only 1Tbsp of red pepper. I also sauted 1 large clove of garlic with the onions.",
