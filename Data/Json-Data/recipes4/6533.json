I ordered it as a side and did not realize that I ordered mashed cauliflower and not actual potatoes. Best food ordering accident ever! I didn't understand back then that they could taste so close to mashed potatoes. Fast-forwarding to now and this recipe - cauliflower and topped with cheese? YES PLEASE! Now this is something I could eat everyday. This is pretty much a base recipe for all of the cheeses you can play around with in this dish. The cream cheese just adds an even more rich, creamy blend to the cauliflower which I enjoy. Then you top it off with a layer of cheddar...cause why the heck not?!",

Can't help myself....\n\nFeb.29, 2016---update---I made this again, today, for dinner. The only seasonings I put in it were salt, pepper and season all, I left my Cauliflower a little chunkier and I did add the butter. I used a half stick and it was so, so good!

The consistency of this is almost the same and it cooks faster than potatoes. I didn't steam it. Instead, I cooked it like pasta and drained it before mashing. It mashes like potatoes too. No starch means it's not gummy. I only had about a tablespoon of cream cheese so I threw that in. I added a bit of shredded cheddar/jack in the mix. I topped with blue cheese crumbles because we had some and because we love blue cheese. I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  My husband thought it was better than mashed potatoes (and he loves mashed potatoes). This is a keeper recipe and my new go to. Amazing.",
