We also added a heaping helping of 'Missing Link' (a fiber supplement) and the treats lasted for 2 weeks sealed in a zip-loc bag in the fidge (actually ran out of the treats before they spoiled).  We're making another batch right now!  P.S.  the pizza cutter idea for cutting them worked great!",

I blanched both in hot water for a minute prior to food processor. Much nicer MUCH!! The beef liver recipe was a bit thicker as the beef cooked more in the blanching process. The Chicken liver batch was more similar to the original both in texture and finished product. I have three Jack Russels and the diabetic one actually takes her shot without shaking when I put these in front of her. All three dogs prefered the beef liver but the chicken liver was a close second. Also made with ground turkey and that is a secondary treat. Just wanted everyone to know BLANCH yukky blood GONE!!!",

I have made 2 other recipes from this site and they can take or leave them.  They nearly eat my hand off to get at these.  So easy, so good, should be a 10 star to give you.
