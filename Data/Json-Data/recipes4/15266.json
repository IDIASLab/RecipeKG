I followed the lead of another reviewer and doubled the quantity of everything but squash. Sadly they were way too salty! I had no nutmeg so used pumpkin pie spice with good results. Instead of frying in oil I made them on my electric griddle. With milk added to thin the batter the 1/4 cup of batter made nice thin pancakes that tasted like pumpkin pie. They cook a little slower than standard pancakes but provided a tasty solution to my dinner dilemma. I will make these again with adjustments.",

The batter was way too thick for pancakes and did not cook evenly mostly because of the squash. (In fact I think these would make great dinner cakes as written maybe over some kind of black bean/sweet corn bed.) I would cut the amount of squash in half for pancakes. I would also add some sugar to the batter maybe a few tablespoons. The author says they are not meant to be sweet but I think a little sweetness would improve them a lot as pancakes. I was quite surprised the recipe did not call for milk. I might add some milk (maybe 2 tbsp or so) if the batter is still too thick. I'm looking forward to trying these again as I always have way too much butternut squash leftover!",
