I still can't figure out WHY everyone at the table balked at it!! I found it fantastic and actually had to FORCE myself to quit eating it because it just tasted so darn good! Next time I make this (and I guess I would be making it for myself only) I plan on adding the chicken and just having that as a meal! I gave this a five star rating but I think this is one of those recipes that people will either LOVE... or HATE.",

I'll tweak it a little next time I make it by adding more potato (my favorite part of the pie) as well as some spices (garlic onion powder parsley) as it was kind of plain. But it was definitely a success as written. My only complaint was that when I added the hot filling to the pie crust the crusts became very soft and hard to work with. I poked through about 5 times while I was trying to seal the edges. It would probably be better to let the filling cool before adding it to the pie crust but it's already a recipe that takes a long time so I doubt I'll ever want to wait. It didn't affect the taste the pie just didn't look as good as a pie normally does because of all the leaky points around the edges. Thanks for the recipe!",
