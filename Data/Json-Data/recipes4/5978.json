I made the recipe as written, tried it on some pasta, and then added 2 ingredients.  It was fine as written; I just knew my family would like a little spice.    I added some red pepper flakes (1 T.)  for a little zip  and some fresh spinach for added veggies.  I will make this again, although I will be using spicy Italian sausage, next time.  We liked the addition of spinach, so I would use that again.  My pasta was medium shells as that is what I had on hand.  Thanks jmcnutt28 for this recipe, we enjoyed it.",

I also used sweet Italian turkey sausage instead of regular Italian sausage hoping to appeal to my toddler. I added spinach leaves just before serving which really brightened it up and I also used about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. I will make it again next time using the half-and-half and the regular Italian sausage and expect it will be 5 stars.",
