There's so much tomato paste and so little of anything else that the whole thing ends up tasting like tomato paste. I would go with 30 ounces of paste and 18 ounces of tomato sauce rather than 48 ounces of paste and no sauce. Also throw in 2 onions instead of 1 twice as much mushroom bay leaf and basil 6 (or more) garlic cloves half a cup or so of parsely and 2 teaspoons each of oregano and thyme. Stand by with some sugar (a tablespoon or two) if you need to cut it further. Also when the porkchops simmer for 8 hours they end up tasteless without adding anything to the sauce so maybe put them in later. If there's less concentrated paste flavor and more other flavors this sauce would be great. (Again the meatballs are wonderful.) But as it is it's not worth 9 hours of your time. (Also this makes a lot more than 10 servings; I'd guess 15 or 20.)",
