                "reviewBody": "I love Persian rice dishes and have been experimenting for awhile with different recipes.  The cooking technique for this dish is right on based upon my research.  I do have a few tips, however.  For best results use Basmati rice.  In addition to soaking the rice I rinsed it gently until the water ran clear.  Watch the rice carefully when you're parboiling it.  8-9 minutes was plenty for me.  For the final cooking stage with the lentils make sure you use a heavy pot with a tight fitting lid like a dutch oven.  Finally, I cover the pot with a damp dish towel and then put the lid on.  This helps to ensure the perfect individual grains that Persian rice is known for.  As long as the heat is on low you can cook for more than the 30 minutes suggested.  The key to this rice is a crispy layer at the bottom of the pan and this recipe doesn't disappoint.  The onions, dates and raisins are garnishes in my opinion, but don't skimp on the saffron.  Excellent.  Thanks XXXX!",
