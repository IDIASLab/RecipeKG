Normally adding goat cheese to a pizza gives it too much bite and not very much flavor. I couldn't find blocks of provolone so I used Mozzarella instead. The two balanced each other perfectly. I caramelized the onion by using about half the amount of oil suggested and instead just brushed the pizza with fresh olive oil to make up the difference. The herbs on top of the pizza is really what made it. It brought the whole thing together. I will definitely make this one again!",

I've made this exactly as written and it's terrific; I've also had great results swapping roasted red peppers for the sundried tomatoes mozzarella cheese for provolone (or keeping the provolone and just adding mozzarella!) and adding roasted chicken and/or fresh saut\u00e9ed spinach - so many combinations all SO delicious! Our fav local market sells balls of fresh pizza dough that we use instead of the kind you unroll from a can. The toppings are awesome but a great crust makes pizza that much better.",

This would add more flavor and texture variety. I also didn't see any benefit from pre-cooking the crust.",
