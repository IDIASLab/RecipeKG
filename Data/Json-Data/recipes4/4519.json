Use any white cheese but Jack cheese or Oaxaca mexican cheese is best when you are frying them because it melts so well. Mozzerella cheese sticks work too but let the cheese come to room temp and works great when you are baking them in the oven. I hope you all enjoy. UPDATE- Green Chilies are also known as Anaheim Green Chilies - think Ortega Brand. These can be baked. Spray them with cooking spray and bake at 325 until golden brown.",

I did them slightly differently due to what I had on hand (I hope you don't mind, Baking Nana)...I had some small wonton wrappers that needed using up, so I used those and decided to use chopped green chilis, as the whole ones would not have fit. I had some pepperjack on hand, so I shredded that. To assemble, I put some shreeded pepperjack and some chopped green chilis on each wonton wrapper, rolled up egg roll style and fried. These made such cute little egg rolls and they were super delicious too! I can't wait to make these again...they would make great appetizers. Thank You Baking Nana for such a different and delicious way to enjoy egg rolls! :)",
