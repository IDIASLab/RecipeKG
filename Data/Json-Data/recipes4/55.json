My husband loved it so much that he ate it as soon as it came off the grill - he didn't want to wait to take it to the table. I used the \"Pizza Crust for Bread Machine\" recipe and made my own sauce; pizza was like what we get at a microbrew pub. Thanks for the recipe Mathilda! Update: I have made this recipe so many times because we can't get enough of it. I've found that neither the grill nor the bread needs to be oiled but I keep the pizzas small (6 inches) so they are easy to move around. After cooking the first side I take them off the grill and add the toppings then put them back on. I use a gas grill with mesquite chips - excellent flavor. I use a combo of mozzarella and smoked gouda cheese but now we're experimenting with salsa (instead of tomato sauce) and cheddar cheese. This recipe is so fun!",

The side that faces the heat came out nice and flat and the side that starts out away from the heat bubbles up and forms nice little cups and pockets to nestle the toppings and sauce in. So I get the first side started just a bit then flip to toast the other side BRIEFLY then flip back to top and fill. You can top it with more stuff with this type dough because it rises more and makes a sturdier crust. To finish a loaded 'za just pop it in the oven broiler a few seconds to melt the top a bit more.",

Really I didn't use anything that the recipe suggests. I just used the guidelines on how to grill the pizza. It was fantastic. The grill gives the crust a nice smokey flavor. Even the one that got a little too done was delish. And all 3 kids liked it a lot! That makes it a keeper right there. The only thing I'd change is I'd turn down the heat - high heat seems a bit like overkill. My crust burned so quickly. I did the others on med-high and that worked fine. We'll be making this quite often. Yum!",
