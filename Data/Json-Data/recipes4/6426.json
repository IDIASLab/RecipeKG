I finally stumbled across Birds Eye Tri-Color Pepper & Onion Blend and thought that would be perfect. I figured because of the simple ingredients in this recipe, the onions would only benefit the flavor. First off, I love that this is healthy and easy! Second, I also love that there's none of that sweet meatloaf glaze that way too many meatloaf recipes seem to have. Eww. Third, I HIGHLY recommend seasoning the raw meat with salt and pepper. I made it as written, and ended up having to add salt because it was kind of bland without.  I bet garlic powder would also be a nice addition if you want to keep things easy. Overall, a very tasty recipe, and one that I'll keep saved for days I'm looking for something simple. Thanks Mary!",
