I was able to process the dough in my food processor. After chilling i rolled it out and cut it into shapes with cookie cutters and baked as directed.

I adjusted it to be gluten-free using one cup white rice flour and one cup garfava flour in place of the all-purpose flour (plus 3/4 teaspoon xanthan gum). I also followed the suggestion to replace the white pepper with cayenne since I wanted them to taste like Cheez-Its. I used 1/2 cup butter instead of 3/4 cup and I used 1 cup of cheese not 1/2 cup as many others had suggested. I think the crackers would have been even cheesier if I'd have used sharp cheddar but I bought mild cheddar by mistake. The recipe worked really well only I had to bake them much longer to get them done enough but that could very well be because of the different flours I used. I will be making these again!",

These did not taste like crackers at all in fact they tasted exactly like pie crust-- so I checked my copy of Rose Levy Beranbaum's book \"The Pie and Pastry Bible\" and sure enough I found that her recipe for \"Flaky Cheddar Pie Crust\" is almost IDENTICAL to this recipe. I will make this again as a pie crust for a savory pie but not as crackers. It was also not very cheesy tasting even though I doubled amount of cheese the recipe called for AND added in some grated romano cheese. I also salted them lightly with regular table salt before baking.",

As with any recipe that calls for cutting in butter you have to take your time and make sure the butter stays cold during this step by putting the mixture back in the fridge if the butter starts to soften too much while cutting it in. This way the ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the dough. I am really excited because now I can use a small cookie cutter and have any shape cheezit I want! I love to have lots of pretty appitizers. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",
