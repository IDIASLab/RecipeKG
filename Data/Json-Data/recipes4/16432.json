Who knew boiled chicken in tons of seasons, fresh minced garlic, chicken bouillon, chicken stock mixed with red peppers, rice with saffron, olive oil and some lime baked to perfection would yield this mouth watering meal?! Here's how I played with it a tad: I used 2 cups of Chicken Stock and 3 C of water to boil with the chicken boullion. I then used red pepper and added seasoned chicken (red pepper flakes, season salt, fresh minced garlic, onion powder, pepper ). After removing chicken Instead of pouring the liquid into baking pan I added rice and olive oil to the skillet and then poured it all into the baking pan. I semi shredded my chicken on top, hitting it with a little juice of lime and into the oven. When it was ready to come out I cut up lime and viola! The best meal I've ever made! Everyone loved it!!",

I also tried Amanda-Rae\u2019s version with additional spices. I am POSITIVE it is not the best thing I have ever cooked. I even added 1-1/2 red bell pepper to the Amanda recipe to try and moisten it up a little. It is still really dry, but not quite as bland. Still not a flavor rainbow, however. I think cooking it at such a high temperature drys it out. Maybe a lower setting for a little longer, for those that may want to try this? I may attempt it one more time with the bell pepper and add some cilantro or something, because I love saffron rice. But there are a LOT of recipes here that are much better. So much to cook and so little time. Frankly, I probably won\u2019t waste my time again with this bland dry recipe.",
