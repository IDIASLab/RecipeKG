I baked mine on a silicone baking mat, and then removed to a paper towel lined baking rack after about 3 minutes to finish the cooling. I recommend the paper towel, as they can be somewhat greasy. Just helps to remove some of the excess grease. I'll be using these to top our caesar salad tonight for dinner! Thanks for the recipe!",

Add at least 1 Tbs. flour for a cup of cheese (this soaks up the liquid from the melted cheese and the crackers won't be crispy without it).  Spread out as thin as you can and bake at 400 for two minutes, then switch to broil until they are as golden as you like (I did 1-1/2 minutes). Watch like a hawk cause they'll burn fast! Use a new sheet of parchment paper for each batch, otherwise you'll smoke up your kitchen! And don't use cooking spray, there's no need for it .:)",
