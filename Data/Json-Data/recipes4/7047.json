I took her advice and added a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes along with a pound of Italian sausage. I did use venison in place of the ground beef because this is what I keep ground venison around for and the only other change I made is that I subbed one of the green bell peppers with 2 large jalapeno's (one with seeds and one without). I was hesitant about the allspice but it worked nicely. This reminds me of my moms chili but she uses tomato paste and I much preferred the tomato juice and diced tomatoes. This makes a pretty thin chili (just how I like it) so you'd need to reduce the liquid somewhere if you are the kind that likes a fork to stand up in it. Loved the addition of beer and this will be my go to chili recipe for now. Thanks for sharing!",
