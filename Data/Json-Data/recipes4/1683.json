The more pointed the jalapeno, the spicier, he said. We hadn't known that, and since we're not big on really hot spice, we chose a very rounded jalapeno for this recipe. It was perfect! A pleasant heat after you eat, but not overwhelming. And oh, yes, we did like the recipe and will make it again. It's a keeper!",

I used stew meat (chopped in small cubes), left out the jalapenos and used Macayo Salsa Verde for the salsa.  The result was a wonderfully flavored meat for tacos, burritos, chimis or in my case, enchiladas.  The secret seems  to be to keep simmering the beef until the liquid is cooked off.  I live in the Southwest and eat a lot of Mexican food, and will make this recipe again and again.",

                "reviewBody": "HELPFUL TIPS THAT HELPED ME: If this is your first time working with beef stew meat, look for beef stew meat that is already cubed and packaged.  You may want to cube them even smaller if you plan to use the meat for tacos, etc.  I've done this both ways & using a FRESH jalape\u00f1o tastes a lot better.  Don't be afraid to use a lot more green salsa!! I used a lot more than 7 ounces.  Use what's necessary to cover all the meat ...and then more as you see it soak up.  You don't want your beef stew to turn out dry!  Lastly, to make this  5-stars, simmer it for an hour.  This is very quick.  I never saw my husband and kids eat so much.  They usually only eat chicken.",

This means the meat must cook in liquid for quite some time, like an hour or more. So, as it is written, this recipe is not good. However, I'm sure the flavors would be excellent with stewed meat. Also, as another reviewer noted, cilantro should not be added before the stewing process. It should be added at the very end, to keep its fresh flavor. I hope to try this recipe again with changes soon.",
