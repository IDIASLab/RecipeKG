I cut the brussel sprouts in half and set them aside. I cooked the bacon til it was crispy, then set to the side and crumbled it.   When the bacon was done, I put the sprouts in bacon grease flat side down and added a dab of margarine/butter so there was enough grease, then added chopped/minced garlic, pepper and a garlic salt to taste.  Flipped them over to cook the other side.  Added the bacon a minute or 2 before the brussel sprouts were done, and then drained all the grease.  They were amazing.  Still had a nice, soft crunch, because we hate soggy veggies, and the flavor was great.  Left out the chicken broth all together.  Again, just my spin on it.  But the basics for the recipe were awesome.",

Added a bit of chicken broth to the sauteed garlic, halved the sprouts, stirred them into the butter/oil/broth to re-heat them, served them with the bacon bits and just a drizzle of the bacon grease.  This veggie dish was an accompanyment to a Kielbasa ring, and served with a side of buttered toast. I used about a dozen large sprouts. 3 slices of bacon, an guestimated the oil and butter to sautee 2 large garlic cloves.  I will for sure make this again.",
