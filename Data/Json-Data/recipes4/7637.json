The only difference that I did was seared for 5 mins each side with olive oil and butter then put it in the oven at 350. I also put some red wine and butter in the searing pan to take off every little bit and simmer it, excellent to top the tritip once cooked. Great recipe, easy and tasty.",

I wouldn't say anything if it was just incorrect, but having the word ROUND in there could really screw somebody up into getting the wrong roast and making an awful dish.\nTri tip is also known as the \"bottom sirloin\", not bottom round sirloin. The tri tip comes from the Loin primal, which is next to the Round primal, but is entirely different. This is important because there is a \"Bottom Round\" roast that you do NOT want to buy if you're preparing this recipe.\nAll I'm trying to say is the word Round should not be anywhere in this recipe, and if you can change that, I would highly advise it (:",

I braised all sides 2 min. each in a deep pan, then added 1/2 cup beef broth and 1/2 cup red wine into the pan, then cooked covered for 40 min. covered, then transferred the roast to a rack and finished it off for 30 min. at 300 degrees uncovered. I then cooked down the remaining pan liquids into a gravy.  Using powders and not salts and cooking this way I'd give it a 5! Can't wait to make it again with that change.",
