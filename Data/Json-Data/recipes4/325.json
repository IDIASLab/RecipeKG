The Habaneros are only sold in bulk at my grocer so I chose to make several recipes this week using them. The blend of flavors is difficult to describe but I can say that it was a a mixture of creamy sweet and pleasing spice. The left over butter mixture can also be spooned over chicken.

This sounded interesting b/c we like spicy in my house and it was perfect! I actually forgot the butter in the fridge when we started eating and the salmon was still good on its own but then I remembered the butter and WOW! I plan to do what some others have mentioned and make a big batch of butter to use with other things. Really do be careful with the peppers. My fingers are still burning a day later.
