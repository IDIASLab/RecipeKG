I used to export my own cans of it (yes, Campbell's sells it in Mexico) ... so I had to get the recipe for myself, especially since I am growing pumpkins and have tons of flowers in my garden!  Also I plan to can it.  If Campbell's can, so can I! You can substitute other squash flowers; if you don't have epazote, tarragon is a good substitute.",

I wanted to use up the pumpkin flowers I had in our garden but I did not want to fry them--like so many other recipes call for. I found this recipe and followed it exactly...although I did put in more pumpkin blossoms. We ate it up. The next day we put the leftovers over white rice as a sauce and it was delicious. Thanks....it was a lot of work but I will make this again.",
