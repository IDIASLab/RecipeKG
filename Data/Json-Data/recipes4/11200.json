It's protein packed- far more than regular oatmeal, so it's a great energy boost for breakfast, and a good source of calcium with all the extra milk added.  I did leave the oatmeal on the burner for a minute or two after the eggs were added, so I was sure they'd cook.  I also omitted the honey during cooking because the first time, it burned.  My kids didn't like this (I thought I could sneak the eggs on them) but I love it. \r\n\r\nIt's a recipe you can play with too - I scaled it back to one serving and still added both eggs and it was really custardy and good.  If you like bread pudding and you like oatmeal, you'll like this. \r\n\r\nThis is also a great recipe for expectant moms like me, whose doctors recommend a very high protein breakfast and three glasses of milk a day for calcium (hard to get those in!) - this meets a LOT of those requirements into one really yummy breakfast!

I added 2TBSP more oatmeal, and then still had to continue cooking on low after the addition of each of the eggs to reach my desired consistency.  However, at that point I was very pleased with the overall product.  I knew it wouldn't be sweet enough for my family, so I substituted 3 TBSP of brown sugar for the honey and mixed it in with the eggs. Then we sprinkled brown sugar on top... oh, and I used just a TBSP or so of half n half on top of each bowl instead of the quarter cup of milk.  Didn't have vanilla, so used a few drops of almond extract... and omitted the raisins as we don't like them.  It turned out delicious and I agree with the other reviewers, it packs an oatmeal breakfast with an extra protein punch so it sticks to your ribs!  Thanks.",

There is really no reason why powdered milk has to be used, so if I make it again I will either use regular (skim) milk or simply use water.  It would probably also be easier to beat the eggs into the liquid before heating.  Otherwise, if you aren't careful, you could end up with streaks of cooked egg throughtout your cereal.",

I fourth the recipe but keep the original amount of cinnamon every time. I love how creamy and delicious (esp with honey YUM) this recipe is!! I have never tasted any oatmeal quite like this!It has ton of protein which I need since I started P90x about 2 weeks ago and i love how it keeps me satisfied and full till lunchtime even if I don't eat lunch till 1 or 2.Thanks you so much Becky!!",
