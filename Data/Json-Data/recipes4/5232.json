My picky kids ate it up and even fought over the last piece. Will definitely make this again. This doesn't taste like mayo nor like corn flakes. It has an easy crunchy coating that doesn't fall off. Crispy and crunchy. A very nice change from the usual corn flour or bread crumb coating as well as being made in the oven cuts out any frying. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.",
