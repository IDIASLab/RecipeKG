To bake the peppers, (I only stuffed 3) I stood them in a loaf pan, added condensed tomato soup to the bottom of the pan, and covered with foil, baked at 375 for about a half hour, uncovered and sprinkled with cheese, returned to the oven for a minute, and served with black beans.",

I boil the peppers for 5 or so minutes first to soften them then add the quinoa mixture and put back in the oven to melt with pepper jack cheese. In the mixture I used 1/2 of a red bell pepper and a can of tomatoes in lieu of the sauce but make sure you add less water (or we used veggie broth) to account for the water thats cooked off from the tomatoes. A few things: I agree with others on increasing the spices a bit. And for me this recipe always takes longer than the stated prep/cook time. Takes a little over an hour or more from start to finish.",
