Served up with sour cream mashed potatoes and fresh green beans...this meal was a big hit!  Thanks so much.  Never knew you could cook ribs on the stove top.

I then transferred them to a large pan with just a bit of the sauce & browned them up a bit on each side & the sauce was bubbly.  Poured the rest of the sauce on & let it thicken about 10 minutes. These were so so so tender!!!!-like roast beef tender! My husband & I were floored!! I frankly could not believe I made them;) Would be great on the grill or in the broiler right before eating, too!! Thank you so much for a simple, but AMAZING recipe!",

My kids and husband loved them so much I had to make them again the following week. We served them with plain white rice and spooned the sauce over the rice. Fantastic! Thanks!",

If you leave it uncovered in a pot and let most of the water simmer out, takes about 2 hours, you will have nice thick BBQ sauce. Yum!",
