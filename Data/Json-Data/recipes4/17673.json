Locally-printed cookbooks abound, in which family favorites are shared from one culture to another. One of my most treasured local cookbook gems is a small, stapled-together collection of traditional recipes from a Burmese immigrant to Hawaii. This Panthay Khawswey, adapted from that cookbook, is a hearty noodle stew the Burmese have been known to enjoy for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.",
