There is NO chance that this serves 8 though b/c I doubled the beans and added a can of diced tomatoes and fed 3 hungry folks who'd come in from a snowy day to the delicious aroma of chili and had a smidgen for leftovers maybe just enough to doll up a baked potato tomorrow. I can only imagine that the type of \"can of beer\" could make a difference depending on which kind you use -- Guinness? Pale ale? That funky lime-flavored beer? I'd give this 5-stars for watching in awe as my 3-year old demolished her bowl but 3-4 stars for it being a ho-hum-kinda-chili. Good but not outstanding. One of the last chilis that I reviewed \"Emily's Chipotle Chili\" blew this one away but I'm still on my mission to test out as many chili recipes that there are on AR sooooo here's my Russian Chili Haiku: \"Didn't quite add up. Sour Cream mixed in the pot? It needed more beans.\"",
