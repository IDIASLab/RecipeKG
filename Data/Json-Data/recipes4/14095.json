        "description": "My own version of posole! Stew made with hominy, garlic, peppers and pork meat. This is made in the slow cooker. I tried to make the stew as colorful as possible, which is why I use both white and yellow hominy and green and red bell peppers. This recipe is best the next day reheated. I love it best with cornbread or EVEN BETTER, fresh flour tortillas.  It is awesome on a cold winter day and is great to take to pot luck dinners.  Can be doubled or reduced in size to accommodate any number of people, and is a relatively foolproof recipe!",

We made it more authentic by serving sliced cabbage on top and lime juice (sounds gross, I know...just try it, it's soooo yum!) and tostadas with sour cream. This has become a go to dinner that lasts the two of us 2-3 days. Highly recommended!!!!",

I then saut\u00e9ed the onion and garlic only and then threw everything (except the red and green peppers) in the slow cooker at the same time and cooked on high for about 4 hours.  Since we like a medium level of spiciness I cut the red pepper to a 1/2 tsp.  Then during the last hour of cooking I added the red and green bell pepper so they would not get mushy and would retain more color.  It was very flavorful and just the right level of spiciness for us.  We will definitely be making this again.  Thanks Lisa for a great recipe!",
