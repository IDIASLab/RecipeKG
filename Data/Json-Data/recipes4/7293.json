We really liked how with this recipe, you put two-thirds the butter-onion mixture in the sandwich rather than all of the mixture on the top. To mince the onion, I just put it in my small chopper and let it do the work. The oven times were spot on for me.  Fifteen minutes covered and 7 minutes uncovered.  Thanks whizgee, for sharing your version of this popular sandwich.  It is a keeper.",

So the change I made was to make them on whole wheat rolls -- \"regular\" size.  Which was also practical because I was serving them for dinner for our family of six.  Other than the bread, I made two of them with smoked ham for my husband and I.  Because our four teenage boys are refugees from Afghanistan and therefore Muslim, I used smoked deli turkey for their sandwiches.  These were a definite hit with everyone, including requests that I make them again!  I served them with a green salad and potato chips.",
