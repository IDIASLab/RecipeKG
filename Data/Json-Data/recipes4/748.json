After I cut the tomatoes I sprinkled them with a bit of kosher salt then started layering the rest of the ingredients. I didn't have fresh bread crumbs so I used italian style. I have to admit I just eyeballed everything. I also used parmesan cheese. On a couple of them I used some light mozzarella to really take them over the top! This dish is great as an appetizer or a side. Thank for a great recipe!",

I mixed Italian style bread crumbs garlic and the oregano and topped the tomatoes then sprinkled on some shredded parmesan salt and pepper and drizzled with olive oil.

We're garlic lovers here so I pressed a lot of cloves of garlic and sprinkled it on. It was also very easy to assemble in the morning and I popped it in the oven after the turkey came out. I doubled the recipe and overlapped the slices in a casserole dish so it came out looking very pretty as well. Thanks Michele for a perfect recipe!",
