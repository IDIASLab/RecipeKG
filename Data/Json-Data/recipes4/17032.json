I flavored the panko with onion powder, white pepper, garlic powder, red chili flakes and seasoned salt. I used 3/4 inch boneless pork chops and they were more than done after 30 minutes in the oven. The soy sauce added a slight hint of flavor underneath the bread crumbs that worked well with the chops. I served them with sauteed swiss chard and sliced potatoes baked in the oven. This recipe is a keeper.",

The only thing I need to mention is based on reviews, I only cooked mine for 30 minutes (instead of 50-55 recipe recommends), and even at 30 mins that turned out dry (hence the 4 stars), and were at 180 degree temp. So 20 mins would be more than enough I would say. Will def make these again!",
