I'm extremely afraid of a presure cooker ( Boom!! comes to mind)  but I used a Dutch oven, over the stove. I made it how my Mom showed me. I made it with Chicken thighs and legs and browned them in the pan a little but not cooked through.  My Mom would add Green olives to the Fricasse.  I also used Green bell pepper, Onions, Lots of Garlic and a Bay leaf with some Vino Seco, (dry white wine) tomato sauce with a little water.  Don't forget to scrape the bottom of the pan for the chicken drippings. Took about 35 to 45 minutes and the chicken was coming off the bone. Mmmmm,  so good my family loved it. I'll be making this again Serve over steamed rice and platanitos fritos ( Fried sweet plantains).",
