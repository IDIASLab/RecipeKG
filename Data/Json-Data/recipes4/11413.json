The second time I made it, I made some changes which I think really improved the final results.  \n\nI eliminated the water.  I didn't see the need for it.  I also eliminated the oregano. I think that was my biggest complaint with the recipe as is - for me the taste was overpowering.  To add some flavor, I added chicken bullion, white pepper, parsley and onion powder.  Lastly, I waited until the final step to add the chicken.  Made as is \u2013 the chicken cooks too long \u2013 the end result is dried out or rubbery chicken.  \n\nA tip for new cooks: Before transferring the flour/vegetable mix to the rice mixture stir about \u00bc to \u00bd cup of chicken broth into the flour/veg mixture.  This helps to eliminate lumps in your final product.  \n",

I used 2 cans of broth and brown rice, left out the water, added butter to the olive oil when cooking the veggies (used portobellas and put in extra because I love them)and then deglazed the pan with a little red wine and added that to the pot.  I also used half & half and another 2/3 cup of 1% milk plus a little nutmeg at the end. I did add salt & pepper to taste as I was cooking.  I almost always add more spices to any recipe I make but I think the recipe as it stands is a great one. I will definatley make this again and again!  ",

If I want to thicken it up I add a can of Cream of Mushroom and it's wonderful. I find it easiest to put a couple chicken breasts in a slow cook all day with salt pepper and garlic salt. When I come home I shred up the chicken (it's like butter by then) and use it for my soup. If I have too much chickent left over I use it the next for soft chicken tacos or a BBQ chicken sandwich.
