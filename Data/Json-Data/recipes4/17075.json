I have problems getting chicken right if I put it in the oven to bake.  I'm much better on stovetop where I can monitor it easier.  I baked it in a pan lined with foil and totally forgot the last step of adding water to pick up the browned bits.  I made my own seasoning using Creole Seasoning Blend from this site---a yummy version.  This leftover chicken will definitely make a great sandwich or salad.  I will make this again on stovetop because it does make for an easy and delicious way to make it!  Thank you, Always Cooking Up Something!",

This fit the bill perfectly and it turned out tasty too! I used skinless boneless chicken tenders and Geoffrey Michaels Cajun Breakdown seasoning. I used a lot more than a pinch though as I sprinkled it liberally over both sides. I sprinkled these with kosher salt before cooking. This was simple, took a little over 30 minutes, and was tasty too. That makes this a winner in my book. I skipped adding any water to the pan since my tenders will still not completely thawed out. Nothing stuck to the bottom and it wasn't necessary. This is a great easy recipe, thanks Always Cooking up Something!!!",
