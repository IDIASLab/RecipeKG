Cooking on High for about 4 hours should work.  Just make sure to check water level constantly, as it dries up much faster than on the stove.

Again just used the food processor and added water until I got the consistency I wanted. Makes quite a lot so I separated into containers and froze some. Was excellent for adding to a quesadilla - lots of versatility and were delicious. With the change to these modifications I now give it 5 stars. This has potential to be a great recipe but TELL me the salt content was a typo? I followed the recipe exactly trusting that 5TBsp salt would somehow mellow out in the beans. It did not. They were WAY too salty and we could not eat them. However the overall flavor (minus the salt) was great! I did find though that a potato masher was not great for getting them to a creamy consistency I put them through my food processor and added more water until they were the consistency I was looking for. Next time will try with 5 teaspoons of salt maybe?",

I halved the recipe to only 8 servings, which is plenty for us.  I made only a couple of changes - I used only 3t of salt (and it was plenty!) yellow onion as that is what I had and I used vegetable broth as the initial broth because I did not want an overwhelming 'chicken' flavor.  As I added needed liquid - I used half water and half chicken stock, which worked out well.  I would give this recipe 5 stars easily, if it did not call for 5T of salt.  That is far too much in my opinion - next time I make it, I will even reduce my 3t to 2t as the broth adds some salt.  Once the beans were ready, I mashed about 2/3 of the beans with a potato masher, added some shredded Colby Jack, a bit of milk and some hot sauce - served as \"refried\" without all the extra work and they tasted fantastic!",

About half way through cooking I had to add about 4 more cups of water because they were getting too dry though they were in my dutch oven. After that I kept cooking them til reduced and they were soft and creamy like restaurant-style refried beans. I used about half the amount of garlic (but next time I'll go ahead and use the full amount) and a whole yellow onion because it was all I had. Instead of adding mozzarella cheese I used 1/3 round \"brick\" of quesadilla cheese. I sauteed the onion in a tablespoon of bacon grease and 2 teaspoons of cumin, 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika and 1/2 teaspoon of marjoram and 1/2 teaspoon of thyme. I used about 2 teaspoons of salt at the beginning and added another teaspoon at the end and for us, that was plenty salty. \n\nI'll definitely make this again. I had about 10-12 cups of cooked, refried beans and very little work. You just have to check on it to make sure the beans aren't getting too dry or sticking/scorching. \n\n(I read in a review that you should only add hot water/broth to beans after they've started and I did that and my beans were very creamy and smooth)",
