I am a package gravy gal and have never made gravy from scratch - I do cook quite a bit but gravy has always been something I left to someone else.  This recipe was easy and very delicious.  I did not chop up the giblets after they were cooked to put them back into the gravy however.  I just made the broth from them.  I did use more of the turkey drippings and less chicken broth - this turkey was very juicy and the drippings made the gravy richer than the chicken broth would have.  This recipe is a keeper and I will definately make this gravy with every turkey.  Thanks.",

If you thicken it, that's to your liking but it changes the original recipe.  Maybe it's an aquired taste but it is definitely supposed to be thin and chock full of chopped eggs.  I grew up on this recipe and have loved being able to find it again since  most gravies are thicker and start with a roux...thanks so much for helping!",
