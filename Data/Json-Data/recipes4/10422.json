If you are one of the unlucky rolling these out by hand, I found that rolling out each of your 4 pieces into a square smaller than recommended, cutting into 9 equal smaller squares, and then rolling each square individually to size worked best for me, and there was no problem getting them thin enough using this method.  Do yourself a favor and fill each one (or have a helper do it) as you roll it out - I had a horrible time with them sticking together having put the finished wrappers in a big stack and ended up wasting most of a batch.  But the few potstickers I managed to make were so good that I saved my filling for the next day and tried again.  A lot of work but well worth it!",

BE AWARE you may need to add a few drops of extra water to make the dough softer! Don't add too much, though, or you will have paste. Also VERY IMPORTANT to let the dough rest for at least 1/2 hour (covered) before working with it. Otherwise, your arms WILL fall off! GREAT SUGGESTION ABOUT USING THE PASTA MACHINE by another reader. DUH! I can't believe I didn't think of that! Anyway, thanks, Steven for this recipe. I live in Italy in a small town where Wonton wrappers don't exist.",
