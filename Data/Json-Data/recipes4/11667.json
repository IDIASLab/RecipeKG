Any sort of stuffed pasta will work ie ravioli agnolotti or tortellini. Keep your broth clear in case a ravioli breaks up in cooking by boiling the pasta separately and add it to the bowls when serving. Frozen shrimp deli roasted chicken or sliced leftover roast meats can be added also. The spinach is a big plus for color and eye appeal. Skip the soy and pass the grated parmesan for some salt and flavor. I always keep some frozen raviolis in the freezer for just such a quick light and healthy meal.

The 2 cups of water to 1 bouillion cube was not enough to cook the amount of ravioli in so I did add more water. I had extra large cubes so I put the while cube in and I also used frozen mixed veggies because I couldn't find just carrots and peas. I added more veggies would add more spinach too. The final outcome was good though I usually don't like to modify the recipe the first time I make it but there simply wasn't enough liquid or veggies for my liking as written.",
