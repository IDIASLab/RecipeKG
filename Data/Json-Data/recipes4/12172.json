The tomatoes should be added before the sausage as cooked through...this way the flavour of the sausage will permeate the sauce while cooking through. The addition of only one tbsp of Marsala wine which pairs beautifully with lots of garlic is really not enough...try more...of both.",

I added more marsala wine than the recipe called for and it gave the sausage a great flavor. My 15 month old and husband loved it. Unfortunately my 3-1/2 year old didn't really care for it. Thank you for sharing I think with just a little less pasta this would have been a 5 star meal!!",

I wanted it a little more sweet so I did add a little touch of sugar. Instead of slicing the italian sausage I removed the casings and crumbled instead. This was a great light and filling meal and I plan to make again! Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE I have made this again and it is just a great light meal! I do add like I said above a lot more marsala. Probably a whole cup to get a nice sauce. I sliced the sausages this time instead of crumbling and I like it both ways. This can certainly be subbed for any type of sausage as well and still be delish. I also do before adding in the marsala sear the veggies and sausage real well first to get a nice brown on them. It gives it so much more flavor! Serve this with some nice crusty bread for sopping and some wine and you have a nice italian meal! Thanks again for the recipe!",
