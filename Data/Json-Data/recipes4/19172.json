I too wondered about the gravy packet but I ran it under cold water a few seconds and it popped right off when I slid a paring knife between the packet and the breast. I also left the string wrap on since it was frozen onto the turkey. The only issue I had was that the seasonings didn't stick to the frozen breast. I rubbed on what I could and dumped the rest in. The gravy was thinner than I like it but when I reheated it the next day it was thicker. I found the gravy to be very tasty and not too sweet as one reviewer said. All in all great recipe without changing a thing. I'm now wondering what to do with the leftover \"veggies\"--use in soup maybe?",

This is the second time I have cooked frozen poultry in the instant pot and the texture is strange. Is it under cooked? Is it cooked? Overcooked? My thermometer read a safe temperature but the middle was pink while the ends were dry & over cooked. The flavors were ok. The rosemary overpowered the entire dish definitely cut that in half. I follow the recipe exactly and for how expensive a boneless butterball turkey is I will not be cooking it in the instant pot again.",
