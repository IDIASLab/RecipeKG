                "reviewBody": "I am assuming the directions call for cooking the pickles separately is because the pickles themselves are not intended to go in the finished product but the directions were not real clear there so I didn't know? I am a huge fan of the Dill Pickle Soup recipe from this site and I chose to keep the pickles in my soup so I just threw them in with the veggies in the last 15 minutes of cooking which saved me a step. I also chose to throw in some chopped potatoes at that time because I was wanting to stretch the pot out. My only complaint is that the sour cream mixture starts separating once the soup is not being stirred and sits for a minute or two. That gives it an unappealing look even though the taste is delicious. For my leftovers I added a dash of Hungarian Paprika just to change it up a little and that worked nicely in there as well. As written this is a good tasting soup but I do think the addition of potatoes added to the overall end result.",
