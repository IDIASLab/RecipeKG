You want to include the \"coral\" red stuff that is inthe cavities as well as the mustard to really get the flavor. It looks weird but don't throw it out! I added an onion and a stalk of celery to this because I've never heard of crab soup without it. Other than that I used half water and half homemade veggie stock and it was incredible!

                "reviewBody": "I made this soup as best I could. Whole blue crabs were not available so I ended up having to use all pre-packaged blue crab meat (I used a full pound.). I'm sure my soup wasn't as flavorful but it was still good. The lack of whole crabs also meant that I did not have any tomalleys to work with. I also didn't pre-cook the carrots; I just added cut up carrots to the soup when I added the tomatoes and cabbage. The soup simmers long enough to cook the carrots. I also used fresh green beans so I added those in the same time I added the potatoes to be sure that they had enough time to cook. I note that the recipe never says when to remove the ham bone or whether to cut off the remaining ham and put it back into the soup. I did. After about two-three hours of simmering I removed the bone and returned bite-sized pieces of ham to the soup. The recipe also never says whether to put the cooked bacon in the soup. I assume you crumble the bacon and add it in towards the end. Since I didn't have any tomalleys I skipped the bacon step altogether. As for seasoning I used 2 T each of salt black pepper and Old Bay as instructed. I thought the finished soup had a bit of a spicy bite to it so I may cut back on the pepper next time. Even without the whole crab tomalleys and bacon it was still good. I will try making this again when I can get whole blue crabs.",
