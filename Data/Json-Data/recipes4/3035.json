Gave it four stars because the amount of salt was a bit too much for us, so I reduced it to less than 1/4 tsp... we could probably do without added salt altogether.  We've made it with and without sausage- both good.  Also made it with 1 Tbsp. dried oregano vs. fresh... great that way too. Thank you for the recipe!",

Made as written except I did use an additional 3 links of Italian sausage. Like other reviewers I sliced the sausage into small meatballs and didn't remove the casings. Next time I'll use fresh basil and oregano but used dried since this is what I had on hand. Five minutes in the oven at 350 to melt the fresh parmesan cheese was perfect. Thanks hungryguy for this amazing recipe!!",

Followed the recipe to a T..I always saute my fresh mushrooms and onions in olive oil and butter before adding to a recipe I just love the flavor of the mushrooms....anyway probably added a little more garlic that called for but other than that right to the recipe. We really liked the fact that it wasn't so \"tomatoey\" yum it was absolutely delicious!! This will be my go to recipe from now on..the search is over! I would love to know if this \"navy chef\" has any more recipes...I served this with Giada D. cheddar onion bread..my god it is wonderful also. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...I truly appreciate it.",
