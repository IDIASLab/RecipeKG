Before I would fry it like my Mom did with onions and a little garlic then I added some brown sugar to it or I would bake it with the pork roast but this recipe beats the other ways by far! So simple and has a great taste my husband really goes \"bananas\" when I make this with pork roast!! The flavor is just great! This recipe replaces Mom's. Thanks for a great recipe!!",

Great one-dish meal served with warm pumpernickel bread and sweet honey butter. DELICIOUS!",
