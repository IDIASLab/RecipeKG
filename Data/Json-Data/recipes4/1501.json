The seasonings were perfect the chicken breasts were moist and tender. My husband loved it!

I would also suggest using a small to medium red onion as in my dish the onion was slightly overpowering.",

I also left out the chives (again didn't have any) but will include them next time for sure! It went together in a snap and smelled great while it cooked. The left over juices will be saved for a soup base. Thanks for a fab post! We loved it!",

Mindless and quick to get in the oven with very little clean-up (particularly if you have the clever habit of lining your baking pan with foil and just tossing it afterwards!). I enjoyed this and while I wouldn't call it extraordinarily delicious it was light tasty and satisfying. I didn't add the tomatoes because I wanted the chicken to brown and the peppers and onions to roast. I kind of smooshed the chicken between the palms of my hands to even out the thickness then baked it for 30 minutes at 375 degrees with the vegetables alongside of not on top of the chicken - again so the chicken could brown. Also I used a multi-purpose seasoning blend rather than the Old Bay. I served this with Pasta Pancetta from this site and some grilled zucchini.",

Didn't have Old Bay so I used half the season salt and then 1 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp of oregano instead of chives. The veggies had a great roasted flavor and the chicken was cooked perfectly in 1 hour. Will definitely make this again!",
