Not only is it extremely easy to make with a few simple inexpensive ingredients you can keep around the house but the dough is heavenly to snack on and the cookies are soft and moist and to die for! Whenever I take these cookies somewhere everyone loves them! And I love that you can mix the dough by hand without even having to get out the mixer which is critical in this house when my toddler (and husband) are sleeping. I've made these cookies dozens of times since I first discovered this recipe and I doubt I'll ever make any other kind of chocolate chip cookie in my life! Thank you so much for these cookies!!!",

I put the cookies on a beautiful christmas plate then wrapped it used some transparent gift wrap and tied christmas colored ribbons that were curly cued for added fun! It was a gorgeous presentation that is very very inexpensive and truely from the heart! the friends love love loved the cookies! Thanks for a fabulous first impression of this site! deserves 10 stars! fyi I added finely chopped pecans to my cookies but then again I am a bit of a nut!:)",

I liked it just as peanut butter regular. Would recommend baking at 10-12 min unless you like a center that tastes a lot like the batter rather than a baked cookie. Of course this is a cake mix cookie so expect it to be like a dollop of cake rather than a flat normal chocolate chip cookie.",
