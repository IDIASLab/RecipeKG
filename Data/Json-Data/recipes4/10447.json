I made it for my boy friend who loves fried rice, so we'll have to wait and see after he tries it.  I tried it and it had great flavor.  I used edame ( soy beans )  instead of peas because that's what I had on hand and I would use a bit less soy sauce next time, just cut down a little.  Overall though it was great and I can't beleive i've had this recipe in my box all this time and have never made this.  It's the only fried rice recipe iv'e found here that's totally vegetarian and luckily it's a good one.  Hopefully now more people will discover this now that someone has finally tried it and given it a good rating.  Thank you!!",

I also used frozen peas instead of canned (more nutricious) and added them with the onions and pepper!  Next time I might put half of the pepper flakes just because my kids thought it was spicy but it wasn't too spicy for me and I'm not big on a lot of spice!  I also added some chicken for some protein and we had this as a meal instead of a side!!!  It was so very yummy!  Even without my adjustments it was really good I just thought carrots would add nutrition and some bulk since it was the only course!!!\n\n****Now that ive made this ohhhh I don't know....100+ times I wanted to add a few things!  This recipe is so easy to adjust to your liking!  First of all if you aren't vegan you can take 1-2 eggs, beat them and add them in last then stir fry until eggs are cooked!  Be sure to get the veggies in there right away once chicken is in there or you will end up with crunchy veggies... unless of course you like crunchy veggies!  I put chopped chicken in and imeadiately start chopping and adding veggies!  We also use brown rice!  I cook 2 cups dry rice seperately in my rice cooked then just blend it all together before adding sesame oil or seeds!",
