I actually was one muffin shy of a full pk and I even had to cut some in half to fit around the edges of my 9x13. I used 7 whole eggs and 3 egg whites (had leftover whites in the fridge) used cheese and garlic chicken sausage out of the casing and crumbled. I think next time I will use 2 cans of diced green chilies....they really add a great flavor to this. All in all there is hardly any left as everyone had seconds....thank you!",

There are 8 English Muffins in a pack and when they are split open you have 16 halves which is more than enough to cover the bottom of the pan, so I think there was a typo in the recipe.  But the layers of muffins on the bottom makes the perfect buttery \"crust\" and it was just perfect to pop in the oven on a busy morning for company or during the holidays!  I will be making this often - very delicious and easy!",
