I used brown rice instead of white, chicken stock instead of water, and omitted carrot although it seems appropriate for this recipe.  I sauteed some red bell pepper and celery instead.  I chose to make this in a slow cooker.  Saute the veggies and kielbasa first, add to slow cooker with dry lentils, spinach and about 4 c chicken stock/broth.  Add brown rice for last hour of cooking.  Next time I will try adding some cumin and topping with grated parmesan at the end. (tip from Giada).",

Additionally, I used kale instead of spinach as it holds up better in my opinion.\n\nI too flipped the water / broth using 6 cups of chicken stock (not broth) and 2 cups of water. I also added a generous helping of garlic, a dash of cumin, and two fresh bay leaves. \n\nOne reviewer stated that the soup is bland, perhaps he or she did not allow the soup to really cook down thus developing flavor. Honestly, 25 minutes was not nearly enough time for the ingredients to mesh and for the flavor to develop. It took me nearly 50 minutes, and having said this next time I will wait to add the zucchini, squash, and kale until the last 15 minutes as it got a bit softer than I prefer.\n\nMoreover, do add salt and pepper to taste, not sure why it was left out on the recipe but it is surely necessary.\n\nI added uncooked rice and F renchlentils and the 50 minute cook time was perfect. \nThis is a healthy and low calorie soup that fit my nutrition plan perfectly.",
