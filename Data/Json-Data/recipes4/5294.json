The good thing is it makes something pretty good out of a bunch of stuff you probably might already have in your cupboard. Now the bad part is it is WAY too salty! You do not need to add any extra salt to this at all because there is way more than enough in the soups. I think this would be better with low sodium soups. I had expected the mixture of noodles and rice to be really weird but it wasn't. They both kinda blended together and you couldn't really differentiate one from the other.
