I did make with bacon and there are 2 tips I have to offer when using real bacon:  \n1) Cook at 375 to 400 for about 30 mins, depending on how crispy you like the bacon. (at the 12 minute mark using 350 degrees, my bacon was raw)\n2) Use a fatter, rounder cocktail toothpick and soak them in water for about 30 mins before using so that the bacon grease doesnt burn them in the oven.\nI will be making again.  The men last night devoured these in about 20 minutes. So simple and so good!!!",

Two other comments: 1- WEAR GLOVES (or you will wind up like me crying in the shower trying to rinse my face) 2- Fun fact: did you know that the pointier the tip of the jalepeno in general is an indicator of it's hotness? If you are looking for more mild peppers pick the bluntest ended ones.",

I will try flavored cream cheese or use others' suggestions of spicing up the cream cheese with garlic powder or something. I also didn't need to use any toothpicks - the raw bacon sticks together when wrapped around the jalapeno and stayed that way in the oven.",
