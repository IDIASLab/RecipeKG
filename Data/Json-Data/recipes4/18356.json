Both of my children, who eat healthy but can be notoriously picky, loved it. You are replacing potato with turnip, which makes this a very healthy and delicious low-carb, diabetic-friendly meal.",

It just didn't sound right but I kept thinking it just might work. My concern was probably due to the fact that while I like turnips I don't use them much in my cooking. An immersion blender have made it go faster and saved on clean up. Also I used one of those super fast countertop blenders and the mixture was blended completely. No lumps. The picture shows the soup with a little more texture than what I made. I wonder if the little lumps would have made a more distinct turnip flavor. I put three pounds of turnips in that soup and wouldn't have guessed \"turnips\" if I had been asked. I served it to two others and didn't correct them when they assumed that it was some different variety of potato. They each had a second bowl and one is taking it for his lunch tomorrow. I learned something today. Thanks for the recipe.",
