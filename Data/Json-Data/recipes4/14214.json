Set aside until they are cooler. Garnish the mujaddara with it and enjoy.  For those who felt it was a bit dry, Mujaddara is supposed to be eaten along side a fresh green salad or yogurt.  One more thing, consider a bit of all spice and cinnamon along with the cumin to give it more depth.",

As per other reviews, I added 1 tsp garam masala to the lentils just before I stirred in the rice. I also sprinkled 1/2 tsp cumin seeds and a few dashes of cinnamon onto the onions as they fried / caramelized. Serving this with yogurt was a must. We used greek yogurt, and it was amazing. The tang of the yogurt with the sweetness of the caramelized onions and cinnamon went so well with the hearty lentil and rice mixture. I fried one large yellow onion, and that seemed to be enough. Next time, I will chop the onions instead of slice them into rings because the rings were difficult to incorporate into the lentil rice mixture. I will absolutely make this again. (I also made homemade whole wheat pitas to go with this dish - they were the perfect for this meal. Used a mixture of whole wheat and AP flour, 2:1 for whatever recipe you use.)",

So the rating is for the recipe as written, but this can be made lots better by:\n* using a vegetable or chicken stock\n* adding the salt after the lentils are cooked, else the lentils will be tough if you add the salt earlier\n* adding some onions at the beginning, while the lentils are cooking\n* add an extra 1/2C liquid - even on my lowest simmer and with a lid on the pot, this still ran out of liquid before the lentils were cooked.\nWhen its time to add rice, also add:\n* extra water (you need 2 cups water for every cup of rice, so if you are going to add 3/4C rice, you should be adding 1 1/2C water, not just 3/4C water).\n* add 1 tsp or so of curry powder depending on how hot you like it.\n* add 1 tsp of garam masala (or allspice).\n* add 1/2 tsp ginger.\nAt serving time:\n* provide greek yogurt or a raita.\n* provide sriracha hot pepper sauce.\n\nI didn't use the vegetable oil as it would have added a bunch of unnecessary calories.",

I use broth instead of just water and as suggested mix a spoonful of the yogurt with parsley or mint as well into my serving or eat it on the side with cucumber slices. I took others' suggestions and added or used in place of other spices garlic powder and powdered ginger allspice powdered clove and cinnamon along with cumin. I have also used some sweet curry powder. This is not particularly spicy so for more flavour you can double the amounts of some of the spices. To avoid getting gas add 2-3 whole clove (the spice not the garlic) in cooking water of lentils. Gives nice subtle flavour and helps your digestion! We also like to add French Fried onions on top along with the caramelized onions. Gives a nice salty crunchiness and texture. My husband added chopped fresh chilis from our garden for heat. So you can personalize this recipe depending on what you have on hand.",

I followed it pretty much as written except that I used one cup of rice instead of 3/4 and upped the water added with the rice to one and a half cups. The rice only took about 10-12 min after reaching the boil to be done too. Also around here anyway the arabic restaurants serve it with crispy onions. To get that they need to be fried for much longer than 7 - 10 minutes. Mine took around 40 min on a med-low heat stirred once in a while to get them to fry evenly. They look almost burnt by the time they're done but they're oh so good! I had to make two batches of this because it disappeared so fast. My 16 month old grandaughter loves it! And my sister and neice requested the recipe as well so it will get used a lot. Thanks for sharing!",
