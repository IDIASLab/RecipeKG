I only had one necessary change: I've never bought a gravy mix, so I scraped all the turkey and onion to one side of the pan, made a roux of butter and flour, added a spoonful of chicken \"Better Than Bouillon\", and finished the gravy with milk, boiling to a nice consistency before adding the turkey back in.  The results were very tasty!  I can't say if I'd like it as much with a packaged gravy mix... prepackaged sauces just don't taste good to me.  But this was a definite comfort food keeper recipe!

Added garlic oregano red and black pepper and a good amount of Worcestershire sauce. I'm not a meat and potatoes kind of girl but I loved this and the darling boyfriend was a huge fan. I will definitely make this again!!",
