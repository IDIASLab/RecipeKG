Definitely 5 stars!!!  After reading through the reviews, please take into account the cooking time of each vegetable and adjust the size you cut them accordingly.  Suggestions to change it up would be:  1.)  Instead of plain olive oil, try the garlic olive oil - gives it a great taste.  2.)  Instead of olive oil, use Wishbone Italian dressing.  3.)  Add onions, whole garlic cloves and quartered mushrooms (must be quartered as whole mushrooms give off to much moisture).  4.)  Add Parmesan or Asiago cheese to the bread crumbs.  5.)  Change up the bread crumbs to the Italian variety - goes great with the Italian dressing.  6.)  Try panko crumbs or the Italian panko crumbs - which are fabulous in place of the bread crumbs.   Thanks Jana for submitting such a great and easy recipe!!!",

My 5 star rendition...used seasoned breadcrumbs and bump it up to 2/3 cup...add a tablespoon or two more of olive oil to compensate for the additional breadcrumbs.  If you dont mind a few extra calories, throw in about 1/3 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese with the breadcrumbs.  Use red skinned potatoes...they have a more more desirable texture and a sweeter flavor that complements the zucchini much better.  Step up the Bell Pepper just a little too...either one large one or two smaller ones.  I like to add one green and one red for some extra variety.  After the potatoes are tender, i put the entire dish in the broiler for a minute or two to give everything a nice, even browning which gives it a VERY delicious crispy outside....just watch it closely...it will burn REALLY fast if you let it!  You just want a nice, even golden browning across the entire dish.  Toss and serve.",
