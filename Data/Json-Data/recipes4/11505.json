Add 3 cloves of minced garlic to the onions at the beginning. Before placing the roast on the onions, I turned up the heat and deglazed the stock pot with Merlot, scraping up any brown bits. I placed the roast on the mixture to cook until done. After transferring the roast to a warm plate and tenting it with foil, I added another 1/2 cup Merlot to the pot and let it reduce by half, adding a Teaspoon of dried thyme. I then added 3/4 cup low sodium beef broth, brought it to a boil then added approximately 2 Tablespoons of roux to thicken. Pour over sliced roast. The leftovers were devoured for breakfast the next morning! Give it a try!",

I took some of the other peoples suggestions and did the following:  using a 3 pound roast - only 2 medium onions, cider vinegar, added 2 garlic cloves and some leftover fresh mushrooms.  I rolled the roast in a misture of rosemary, ground black pepper and a little garlic powder first, then browned on all sides in a little olive oil in a iron skillet first, turned over once while cooking.  When roast was done I took it out and added 2 TBSP flour to about 1 1/2 cups water (put in tupperware container and shook up first)then added to gravy on high, stirring occasionally, also added a beef bouillion cube for flavor (it was a little bland before adding this).  I broke up the meat and added back to crock pot once gravy was ready and served with mashed potatoes.  It was very yummy, not dry at all, and my whole (very picky) family loved it!!!!!\nI will make this again.",

The instructions were clear and to the point. \r\n\r\n\r\nI had an occasion to try this recipe as a belated birthday dinner. The end result was good. It was tender and the beef had a mild bay leaf onion flavor. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor this recipe I used a seven pound plus hunk of bottom Round (tied) and eleven onions as recommended by the \u201cScaling and conversion\u201d feature of this site. Vinegar? I still don\u2019t know what part it plays in this recipe.\r\n\r\nAll in all I was impressed with the taste of the beef. It wasn\u2019t  dried out or tasted like cardboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of the end result I decided to omit the all-purpose flour and water. I had more liquid than I expected. I tasted the liquid and I was a little disappointed.  In my opinion, it was a weak onion broth.  It was bland and needed help.  \r\n\r\nI made a Rou\u00e9 and incorporated the liquid to make a medium sauce and added bullion and a few others ingredients to give it some taste. I didn\u2019t have a blender handy or I would have taken the onions and processed them to add as a thickening agent and to add flavor.\r\n\r\nMy over all impression of this recipe is good and my comments are; you may want to add herbs to improve the taste of the broth. The herbs when added at the beginning of the cooking process will infuse the roast nicely with whatever you decide to add.      \r\n\r\n",

I put one cup of water, with apple cider vinegar and put the roast on top. I also only used one large sweet onion.  My extra addition that makes the gravy especially good is a couple whole sprigs of fresh rosemary (I remove when done and strain out anything big).  I puree the onions in the water to make gravy, just added a little salt and thickener (flour or cornstarch). Afterwards I have one very happy husband :)\n",
