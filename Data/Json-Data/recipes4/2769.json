I used a thin crust pizza dough so it was more 'flat bread pizza' than traditional pizza. I also used only 4-5oz goat cheese (plain not seasoned) and that was enough. I only needed 2 roma tomatoes b/c my crust was on the smaller side and I took other recommendations and tossed the arugula with lemon juice EVOO salt and pepper before topping the pizza and I think that made it even better! Oh and save yourself all the hassle and use minced garlic instead of cutting garlic yourself! Cannot wait to make this again!!",
