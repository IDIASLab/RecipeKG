But I made the following changes: 1 - Used regular all purpose flour 3 cups. 2 - Omitted the Allspice - But used the rest of fragrant spices. 3 - On the bread wash all you need is 1 T. of water and 1 T. of maple syrup and the oats. More than that is wasteful. 4 - I elongated the loaf slightly baked on a dark round pan so drop the temp to 350 degrees for that. Using allspice with the other spices will make the loaf too pungent. The other spices on their own are fantastic! Hubby loved this! And of course the use of genuine maple syrup instead of sugar makes this so much healthier - of course using spelt flour and oat flour would have too but I didn't have any:) Great recipe!!!",
