Asafoetida is a ground up root that smells awful but kind of tastes oniony when cooked.  It helps keep you from tooting, which is a good thing, considering how bean heavy these rotti are.  It's super easy to find at any Indian or Middle Eastern market.  I've even found it at East Asian markets.  It's considered very, very good for you and has many uses in traditional medicine.  You can make these without it, but try not to if you don't have to.  It's worth the trip to the grocery store.",

We tried to stick to the recipe but we quickly saut\u00e9ed the jalepenos and onions (a combo which I subbed in for green chiles) first before adding to the dough. Didn't know what asafoetida powder was so we skipped that. Used cumin powder instead of seed and left out the cilantro. Added fresh pepper and sea salt to the dough. Left out the coconut. Fried these things in butter. Just trying to show that you can make these and have them taste delicious even without some of the more exotic ingredients like asafoetida and coconut.",
