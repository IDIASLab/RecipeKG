I used garden veg cream cheese (again no 'plain' in the fridge) and added 3 cloves fresh roasted garlic. I also added too much garlic salt and threw in a cup or so of chopped romaine lettuce (I know right!) to cut the saltiness. Turned out divinely and the lettuce added a nice crunch akin to chopped water chestnuts. Finally I didn't use a crock pot but baked it on low at 250F in the serving dish since I am taking it to a garden party!",
