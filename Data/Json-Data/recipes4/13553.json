The cubes with the boiling water are stronger, but the cold water ones are prettier (and still taste quite minty). If I really want to get crazy next time, I'll steep some leaves, let the water cool, and replace the dark leaves with fresh ones. I'm looking forward to trying this with other herbs, too. Thanks, Skuba - great idea!! ",

To make it even more perfect I used the recipe (really a tip) \"Ice for Cocktails \" also from this site. I also didn't use hot water...I didn't like the idea of it \"cooking\" the mint. (I had visions of it looking like seaweed within an ice cube) Ideal use of mint for me because other than using it as a garnish for desserts I use it for nothing else and it always seemed like kind of a waste. I used this for just plain water with dinner and I know I'll appreciate them even more with summer beverages.",

I could only find a tiny ice cube tray that goes in the mini fridge in the basement. So I only made 14 mini ice cubes. Since they were small I used 1 mint leaf per cube. My mint didn't turn that dark like others--perhaps because I have chocolate mint which is darker in the first place. These were so easy and went along well with the Sun Brewed Mint Tea we made as well. I think I may do this with savory herbs like rosemary and freeze with chicken broth for recipes. Thanks for the recipe!",
