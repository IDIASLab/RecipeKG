One thing I do, is if there is alot of fat on one side of the tri tip, I slice it off in 1 piece, then lay it over the top of the meat as you grill it, it gives it alot of flavor, makes it juicy, and protects it from burning too!",

Once you poke the meat you will loose all of the juice and flavor. and by the way I grew up in a lil town called Guadalupe Ca. it is right next to Santa Maria. That is where i learned how to cook Tri Tip. and I have never had a complaint..",
