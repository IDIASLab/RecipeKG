They were even too sticky to come off the wax paper (as recipe indicated to press between). They fell apart turning and I did not like the texture much. I think it would have been better if the beans were not mixed until smooth but instead left a little \"chunky\". The spices used had a very good flavor and a creamy sauce is an excellent accompaniement to the black bean flavor- but the sauce was quite plain. I made another batch of sauce blending roasted red peppers heavy cream and cayenne pepper;liked it much better. I would try again only to see if dried beans binded better and with a more flavorful sauce. sorry...",
