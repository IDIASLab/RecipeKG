With the exception of using chicken stock in place of lamb stock, I followed the directions to a T. Just before adding the green beans, I tasted the broth and added more oregano and cinnamon and also a bit of brown sugar to cut the acid of the tomatoes. I gave the green beans 30 minutes because we like them a bit soft in stews. Surprisingly, it was a hit with the family! Next time I'll pay more attention to trimming the fat off those chops! Even better..this would be great with lamb stew meat!.",
