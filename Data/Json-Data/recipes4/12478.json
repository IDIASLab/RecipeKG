I had a bell pepper I needed to use up that needed to be sauted as it was past the time when you would want to eat it raw as ti was kind of wilted and wrinkly. So I set out to find a recipe that I could use it with that I had all the rest of the ingredients to and I found this one. I wasn't too sure if I wanted to make it after reading the other reviews but decided to go ahead and give it a try. The recipe was definitely lacking flavor and I had to add a few things to give it at least some taste. After that it wasn't bad although still could use some work.",
