I also added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and one of stevia powder, and 2/3 cup of blueberries. Great muffins! Lots of protein, and perfect for my reactive hypoglycemia diet as well as my daughter's gluten free diet. It's a keeper.\n\nOk, made it a second time!  This time I followed the recipe exactly, except i was short 1/4 cup almond flour so substituted coconut flour and I only had 3 eggs on hand so used a tad extra almond milk. And I shaped it as a loaf this time, again,  it was great! I might add some rosemary next time? With the olive oil that might be nice.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is excellent. My family says it tastes akin to cornbread, but it doesn't fall apart like cornbread does. Works great as sandwich bread, and I've been making it every week or so for specifically that purpose, or just as a snack with cream cheese. Very filling and a great low-carb option that still has some fiber! One of the few recipes I was able to find that didn't involve beating egg whites, which when I first made this I did not have access to a beater. \n\nThis may be obvious (though it wasn't to me) that the default 8 servings will not nearly be enough to fill a bread pan, or at least my bread pan. Had to go with the 16 servings option at the top there. \n\nI have been using psyllium husk to add fiber to other breads, but have not tried it with this recipe. For a more fiber rich alternative, some or all of the flaxseed meal could probably be substituted for psyllium husk if you've got it!\n\nTry adding more liquid (olive oil and milk) if your bread ends up really dense and hard to chew. I added an extra 1/4 cup of each and the batch turned really fluffy and delicious. My girlfriend will finally eat it!",

It really turned out great, better than I expected! I am not sure why another baker found the recipe too dry because I was worried that it was too wet. The picture also shows a square shaped bread but I used a loaf pan as in the recipe. The result was very \"bread-like.\" Good sliced and toasted with butter and jam, good with peanut butter, or cream cheese and smoked salmon. I had several non gluten free friends and my husband try it and they all liked it too. Thank you so much!",
