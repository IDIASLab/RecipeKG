I cooked the breast in a pressure cooker and used that broth for the soup. All the flavors of the spices came together very well in this soup. My husband and sons really enjoyed it. I threw some broccoli in the leftover soup I had for lunch the next day and that was a great addition also. I certainly will make this again.",

Add chicken and broccoli like other reviewers suggest thicken it a little more for a delicious sauce on veggies or fish or add a little Italian sausage to warm your belly. I can't wait to make it again and \"play\" with it.",
