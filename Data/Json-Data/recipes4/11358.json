There wasn't enough liquid to make a dough so I started adding a little more rum until there was at which point the butter started melting and then it was too wet. Maybe if you mix with your hands to melt the butter and add a little more rum than called for it might work. I tried baking them anyway but they really didn't taste all that interesting so it wasn't worth trying to save the rest of the dough. Just kinda like chocolate cookies. And mine came out looking more like brown pretzels than crowns anyway.",
