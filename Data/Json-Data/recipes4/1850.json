What I did was take a can of whole cranberry sauce and mashed with with a potato masher, mixed it with the pinapple and then poured it over the pork. It was excellent.

I put in a generous amount and then added the pineapple and cranberries. I did not use salt since I was using terriyaki and that is salty. It was great - moist and had lots of nice flavor.

I will, however, use this recipe again for pork chops, small pork loin, or chicken breasts instead.  \r\n\r\nThe rest of the recipe is great - a nice, light fruit flavor (I used spicy seasoning salt)....but there is not enough liquid to cover the entire roast - so if you do use a roast - turn it over halfway through, so the top half doesn't dry out.  \r\n\r\nAgain - a very nice flavor.  If you are looking for more spice - you might have to add a splash of teryaki or soy sauce.\r\n\r\n  Great way to get fruit into a meal!",
