I did saute some diced zucchini and red onion first which I added to the quinoa and some veggie broth as in step 1. (I tasted it at the end of 15 minutes... and I could have eaten it all right then!) I followed the rest of the recipe as written topping with bread crumbs rather than panko (dear hubby shopping foul noted). In the end a satisfying and healthy new comfort food!",
