Sprinkle herbs straight onto fish & heat a few tsp of olive oil in a cast iron skillet.\r\n\r\nI've found that farm-raised catfish filets are fairly thick, so I cut them in half and cook about 5 min per side.  After heating the oil on high & adding the fish, I turn my burner down to med to finish cooking.  They still are blackened enough for me, and this helps cut down on the amount of smoke produced.",

Over the years I've tried it at home with different seasonings and finally found a seasoning blend I loved. Hubby and I also perfected the method--we eliminate the smoke issue by heating the cast iron pan over fiery hot coals and blacken the fish outdoors! Bored with the same seasoning, I wanted to try my hand at mixing one up myself and happened along this recipe. I realized that between the three peppers this might be a little too hot for us, so I cut the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. leaving the amounts of the other peppers the same. It still was too hot for hubby, so next time I'll cut the white and black peppers back a bit too, to maybe 3/4 tsp. each--but this is just a matter of personal taste.  I also added some garlic powder. I like using a thinner filet for this method of preparation, and tilapia is a perfect choice.  The final result? This is blackened fish perfection, as fine as I had in that first restaurant experience. Love this seasoning!",
