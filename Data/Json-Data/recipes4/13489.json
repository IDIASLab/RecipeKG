This is exactly like it. I love it on tacos as a dip or on tamales. I didn't know what hass avacados were and I think I used to big of avacados because mine was very thick so I had to thin it with more water. But it was still very spicy and tasty! This will be a staple in our house for sure. My husband took it to work and everyone wants me to make them some. I did add a little lemon juice to keep the avacado from turning brown as it started to do on the top just a couple table spoons. Great taste!",

I made the salsa exactly as the recipe stated (except maybe a little light on the salt) using my own home-grown poblanos and jalapenos. I was impressed by how quick and easy it was to make especially when compared to traditional salsas. The flavor was outstanding! It was the cool creamy flavor of a good guacamole followed by a nice kick of spice. I would almost qualify this recipe as closer to a spicy guacamole than a salsa. I can't wait to make this for my next house party! This may not replace the salsa at my next party but it will definitely be my new go-to guacamole dip!",
