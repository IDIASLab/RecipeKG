                "reviewBody": "To Tim ~ And those who have had the occasional hard bean problem with the  quick soak method. You mentioned that the beans needed the over night soak because the quick boil and simmer method did't get the beans soft enough and some of them were still a bit hard.  I have had this problem as well before and I realized that I needed to only bring them to a rapid boil for 1 min making sure there is  enough water for the beans to absorb and then some for the soak, you CAN'T add more latter ~  Then remove from heat and cover with a tight  lid to soak for 2 hrs  There should be plenty of water to drain after the soak . When you get to the part where you want to simmer be sure the liquid is bubbling slowly not boiling and then just check for tenderness  every 1/2 hr  until done. and that's it ! Believe me I have had the hard bean issue and cooked them for what seemed like forever and they did not soften so I know how frustrating it can be. I hope my advice helps you and never have  to deal with the occasional hard bean ever again ~",

I have also made with bacon which I cook completely and then freeze so it is available.  You can just chop up frozen pre-cooked bacon and throw it right into the soup pot.  Since celery, carrots and onions last a long time in the fridge/pantry, this is a go to recipe when the grocery supplies are dwindling. \n Sometimes I add celery seed, thyme leaves and/or bay leaves.  I always add a teaspoon of sugar and a tiny splash of cider vinegar.  I usually use half chicken broth and half water.",

I also added a couple of cooked & crumbled pieces of bacon.  The onions and celery were obliterated in the process (in a good way).  The lima beans really need an overnight soaking.  The boil & simmer method was okay, but some of the beans were a bit hard.  But it was still awesome.",
