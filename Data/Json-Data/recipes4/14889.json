The two biggest tips I've learned in making these is to heat the milk and butter before mashing in, and to use a hand masher as opposed to an electric mixer. Using these methods, I have NEVER had the potatoes come out pasty or soupy, always super-fluffy with just enough body.",

I brought the water to a simmer, rather than a full boil, before adding potatoes and cooked at high pressure for 4 minutes. I had to do a 10 minute natural release instead of a quick release because some of the water started to come out when I tried the quick release. I just waited about 10 minutes and then released the rest of the pressure. Nice fluffy potatoes! Thanks for a great recipe! :)",

After draining the potatoes I had to stir back into the hot pot to get the liquid (from overcooking) to evaporate before I could finish the recipe. Maybe 30 is a typo! I bet 3 minutes is right.",

I used an electric pressure cooker (which cooks slightly slower than the stove-top pressure cooker used in this recipe) and assuming you use potatoes cut to the stated 3/4\"size, it takes 8-10 minutes, MAX.  They wouldn't even take 30 mins if you were to boil them in a pot on the stove!  I did add a bit more milk, personal preference, and I also like the recipe creator's suggestion to add horseradish. Mashing them by hand (as in the recipe) is far superior to using a mixer to avoid gluey potatoes.",
