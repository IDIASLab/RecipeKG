In contrast to one reviewer, I had no problem finding a 24 ounce carton of cottage cheese at the grocery store.  Instead of lasagna noodles, I used a 12 ounce bag of whole wheat wide noodles (like egg noodles). I also lightened other ingredients by using fat free evaporated milk and lean ham.   I cooked it in the slow cooker and it really tasted delicious.  I was surprised, however, by the texture...everythig kind of melted together and looked like some sort of pudding or something.  It was not what I was expecting.  But it really was very tasty!  I would actually give it about 4.5 stars.",

I added caramelized onions that I sauteed with salt & pepper. I also didn't cook on low for 6 hours...I cooked it on high for 3 hours because I needed it done quicker! I used smoked ham and added shredded cheddar ontop. And I also sprinkled it with fresh chopped chives for color! This was pretty good! I just wish it was more creamy instead of brothy!

I probably should have cut the time down and should have started it after my chiropractic appointment but I wanted to eat earlier in the day instead of later.. I checked it just before I left and a knife went through the lasagna sheets but I wasn't sure if the eggs in the sauce were done and I couldn't take the time to temp it and obviously couldn't turn it off or put it in the fridge. I just let it keep cooking.. I didn't expect to be as long at the chiropractor's as I was and it had cooked for most of the time specified by the time I got back. The noodles were mostly OK except where they were sticking up around the edges and the sauce had dried out as well. It had good flavor though and I liked it. Next time I will cook it for a shorter period of time and use the thermometer to check that it's properly up to temperature. I also think that you could do the sauce with or without the eggs and mix it with hot spaghetti or linguine and add the ham and mix it together. I thought the sauce was very tasty before I added the eggs to it. This is a more delicately flavored dish and I don't think some of the reviewers appreciated that.",
