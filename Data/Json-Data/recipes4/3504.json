I used all fresh vegetables and lessened the amount of Brussels sprouts after reading some of the other reviews.  I steamed the broccoli and Brussels sprouts until just turning tender as directed but roasted the asparagus with 3 pieces of bacon on a baking sheet for 25 minutes rather than steaming them. I then tossed all the vegetables together with the bacon, crumbled, and a little bit of the bacon drippings. I sprinkled the bread crumbs on top (not as much as was called for) and at the end sprinkled the top with a little grated cheddar rather than mixing the cheese in.  I am excited about making this dish for a large family gathering next week as I know it will be a hit.  This is absolutely the best way to eat your green veggies!",
