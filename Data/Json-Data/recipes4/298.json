Warm the spread in the microwave and then bake it in the breadbowl it won't take as long and the bread won't get too overcooked. You can also use \"lite\" NOT fat-free cream cheese and sour cream and you can't tell the difference. Enjoy!",

I used a round loaf from the freezer and tried to hollow it out before it was completely thawed. I also had a logistics problem with the bread bowl fitting in my toaster over and I didn't want to use my regular oven. I made do by microwaving the dip and putting it in the cold bread bowl. It also made a lot as an appetizer for two so we ended up hacking away at the cheesy bread bowl for a couple of days. It was great. I'll make it again and try baking the dip in the bowl next time.",
