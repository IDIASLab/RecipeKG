        "description": "Shui Zhu Yu is one of the most common Sichuan fish dishes. 'Shui Zhu' is also one of the most famous Sichuan cooking styles. Its essential ingredient is Sichuan bean sauce. 'Shui' means water. 'Zhu' means boil. You might have also heard about 'Shui Zhu Niu Rou' which uses beef in place of fish. You may use 2 cups of soy bean sprouts to substitute for the celery and Napa cabbage stem. Cod is also a good substitute for basa. Enjoy the fish and I wish you 'Nian Nian You Yu'--Happy New Year!",

First there's no way that the napa and celery would cook thoroughly by soaking in hot broth and having hot oil poored over it. The fish did not take on much flavor either. I will not be repeating this one.",

With the bean paste at direction #3 in oil before you add the water or stock. I love the Sichuan region for the layers of flavors you can create in a short time. With the bean paste you can play with many more flavors. Dark soy Black vinegar sugar sesame oil(use sparingly) and I would add some toasted white sesame seeds and scallions cut on a bias as garnish instead of cilantro. even though the chilis were brought to Sichuan from there thats where it should stop.",
