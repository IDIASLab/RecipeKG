Dr. Pepper a nice touch did mine low n' slow.\" Used a pork LOIN (3 lb.) not tenderloin b/c I don't like to obliterate a lovely tenderloin by shredding it and rubbed it down w/ the dry spices called for in the recipe. Dumped all the ingredients on top of it and let it sit on low for 7 hrs. b4 shredding and returning it to the slow-cooker where I left it on the \"warm\" setting for a little while b4 we were ready to have it for dinner. (Served w/ sweet potato fries salad and collard greens.) I thought the nutmeg was a little too heavy and the sauce too watery so making it again I'd halve the nutmeg and drain the tomatoes entirely.",
