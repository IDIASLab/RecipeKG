That said, I'll add fresh thyme next time, and maybe add it to the simmering figs.\nAlso, I used fresh figs (awesome!) and added a splash of white wine when cooking the figs.  Served with goat cheese.  Aside from picking out the thyme sticks, this dip was phenomenal!\nUpdate:  I've made this three times in the past month its that good (and also because fresh figs are in season!).  If you're using fresh, I cut up a pint into small pieces, and that amount works perfectly.  I haven't encountered anyone who doesn't LOVE this dip either.  I use fresh herbs (rosemary and thyme), but either way you need to add it to the simmering figs or else it stays twiggy.",

Already 3 people have asked me for the recipe which I now will pass on - reluctantly!\r\n2 points to make:  take note that it should be left if possible OVERNIGHT to allow flavours to mature so give yourself that time.  Also, not reading the recipe correctly I went ahead and pureed all the ingredients.  Although it was a fantastic spread, next time I will remember to finely chop ingredients so it has a \"chutney\" consistency instead.\r\n",
