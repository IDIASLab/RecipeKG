I contemplated just making 1/2 a recipe but I am so glad I decided to just make the whole thing because I think between myself and my son we already ate 1/2 of it lol. I made this as written except that I'm lazy so I just used a box of frozen chopped spinach that I thawed and drained really well (I just threw it all in there). I also added a couple pinches of salt at the end but that's a personal preference. My mom makes the BEST traditional hummus that I've ever eaten but this is right up there with that. I will definately be making this VERY often! Thanks Andy for sharing such a wonderful recipe YUM!:)",

This recipe combines all my favorite flavors and it really is over the top. I followed the recipe as written except I used a 10oz. package of frozen chopped spinach squeezed drained and it worked just fine. I cut a red bell pepper in half and used that as my serving \"bowl\" and I toasted wheat pita points. My friends LOVED it and complimented how fresh this tasted compared to store bought hummus I felt proud:) Thank You CNM Catering for sharing your lovely creation. We plan to make this at least twice a month to use as a dip for fresh veggies as well. This is a winner for sure!",

I too started with dried beans so I used liquid from the roasted red peppers to make up the missing. (The liquid from my dried beans didn't look very appetizing.) My husband liked this! I did process the red peppers right into the hummus because my husband prefers them that way. We've never had artichokes before so I'm not sure which flavor they were in there but this was a tasty hummus which I'm sure would be enjoyed by anyone who likes the spinach & artichoke dips sold commercially because if we liked it it must be good! I particularly liked the hot sesame seeds as a substitute for expensive tahini; I always have olive oil & sesame seeds so I think I'll keep that idea for the future! Thanks for the recipe CNM Catering!",

So after I made it I put half into a dish for me in the fridge and the other half I melted 4 oz of cream cheese in for DH. Both versions were great! One was more like traditional hummus (with a twist) and the other was more like a classic artichoke dip. I topped both with chopped pimientos because I was out of roasted reds. Served both with seasoned toasted Pita bread. Delcious recipe and will definitely be making agin! Thanks CNM!",
