I did not season the shrimp or use olive oil; just cleaned and peeled them then fried in the bacon grease. Also used regular toasted bread to make the sandwiches. For a complete meal add a salad.",

Could not find chipotle pepper so added a little bit of a roasted green chili instead...was nervous about how spicy this would be so did not really add enough but the lime juice helped to give the mayo a little zing. I grilled the shrimp on skewers and brushed with EVOO and Santa Maria seasoning...Yumm just by themselves. Had fresh tomatos from the garden...yumm again. Put everything together as described in the recipe (had to remember the bacon as its not included in the assembly instructions...lol) Used the skewers from the grilled shrimp as large toothpicks to hold the sandwiches together. Served this with grilled corn on the cob. The sandwich was well loved by all even my sick husband came out of the bedroom and wanted the other half of my sandwich...lol. Thanks!",
