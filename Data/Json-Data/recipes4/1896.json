The meat was done no problem, but the cuts didn't get crispy at all and actually stayed a bit oily. I will try this again. Maybe it's me and not the recipe. ",

After I coated the chops I lay them in a dish covered with a plastic wrap and placed it in the fridge for an hour. I also didn't do too good a job in crushing the big onion pieces in the packet but that worked out well for me. I opened up a canned chicken gravy. While that was heating up I took the burnt onion pieces out of the oil and mixed it into the gravy. That added an extra punch to the gravy. I served with Fried Rice and steamed broccoli. Next time I'll try to serve it with tomato and mango salad (diced tomatoes chopped onion diced mango chopped cilantro juice of lime). This will definitely be a part of the meal rotations list.",
