I used Dean's French onion dip and used a little more more milk than listed just to make it creamy.   Also a little tip...I always just throw a large peeled garlic clove in my raw potatoes while they boil.  It fully cooks and mashes perfectly in the potatoes. It gives you a nice mild garlic flavor when you don't have the extra time to roast garlic in the oven.",
