My family came here from Tuscany in the 30's to expand their business and thankfully they packed their cooking talents. Our stuffing blows this out of the water maybe I'll post it. You can somewhat fix this greasy bland stuffing by using mild Italian sausage 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper and French bread and it will jump it two stars.",

I melted 2 sticks of butter in a Dutch oven and added the celery and onion. After about 5 minutes I added 1 pound of ground white chicken and continued cooking until the chicken was done and the celery and onion were clear. I stirred in one 14 ounce bag of herb stuffing and one can of reduced sodium chicken broth. You can add a little hot water if it is still too dry (I personally like really moist dressing). I also added a bit of pepper. You can serve it as is or put it in the oven if you like it browned. This version too was delicious. Thanks Michelle for sharing this great recipe.",
