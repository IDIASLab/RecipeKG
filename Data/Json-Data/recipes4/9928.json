We then added the onions until they were carmelized threw the chops back in the pan and added the richness of a can of Cream of Mushroom Soup.  Talk about intense flavor.  Served over a bed of hot rice it is heavenly.  Enjoy!!!",

Thanks for adding a great meal to our menu!",

Follow this instead: Heat veg oil in deep pot, season your chops (use bone in chops, not boneless) with salt & pepper or even seasoning salt, dredge chops in flour, fry chops just until brown on each side (chops will still be raw in the middle), remove & drain on paper towels, remove all oil from pot except approx 1/4 cup, add onions & sliced bell peppers, brown until tender, add chops back in and add just enough water to cover chops, cook covered on med/low for about 45 minutes. You can stir it a couple times just to make sure everything is cooking evenly. The chops will be tender and a delicious gravy will be ready to add to the rice. Enjoy!!",

I followed the recipe decreasing the flour to 1/4 cup (as suggested) and used Worcestershire rosemary season salt & pepper - also as suggested by reviewers. Cooked boneless chops a little less than 30 minutes. They were DRY. The sauce was VERY thin and had a \"funky\" taste to it and very little flavor. Now again I could have made a mistake somewhere but I double checked to make sure I didn't miss anything. These were NOT good. I will not make them again.",
