This gives it a delicious sweet flavor that is not cabbag-y at all.  If the cabbage seems to be sticking, add more butter or a little oil. I add salt while it is cooking to help sweat out some of the water inside the cabbage leaves.  I also do not use onion but it would definitely be a nice addition.  My Hungarian grandma always made this and now I make it for my family.  No matter how much I make, we eat it all in one sitting.  It is also very inexpensive.  Can be a side dish or main dish.",

I should start by saying that I don't know if I should even review this recipe because I did not stay true to it as written (we gave it 4 stars as written but did make some changes this 2nd time through). I started by browning a pound of diced bacon and when it was crisp removed it and then sauteed the cabbage and onion together slowly in the bacon fat until nice and carmelized. The I added the bacon back in plus 3 cloves of minced garlic. Then added in cooked homemade noodles. It was sooo good. Thanks rlecook!!",

Sometimes I go crazy and add turkey bacon or, cook the cabbage down in a little chicken broth. I always add some garlic.  This dish really isn't anything special (in fact, overall it's pretty bland)and yet, it always gets gobbled up. Served with crusty bread slathered in butter and cheap red wine served European style in a short chunky glass - it seems to appeal to a sense of primal peasantry and, a longing for simpler times.",
