        "description": "Yet another crustless quiche that is designed for a low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet. It is very rich and cheesy. The Parmesan and butter on the bottom form a nice skin on the bottom that really helps. The egg and cream mixture is quite flexible and the ratio of egg to cream and the heaviness of the cream is a personal choice. The cheese can easily be replaced with any hard cheese that holds up well when shredded such as Swiss, Cheddar, Gouda, or Provolone. The meats can be replaced with anything that isn't too wet; whether it is meat or vegetable.",

Never made quiche before so I tried this one since it was \u201ceasy\u201d. It was. I skipped the bacon and used 1lb of spicy Italian chicken sausage. I also added mushrooms and some chopped onion to the sausage while browning. I didn\u2019t have any Parmesan cheese but I did have the cheddar cheese so I used that on the bottom of the casserole dish instead. I thought it sounded like way too much cream so I used 1 cup only of half and half and all eleven eggs :-). I also mixed some of the cheese into the eggs AND some spinach. I sprinkled some cheese on top of the sausage, as described in the recipe, then I poured the egg mixture in and topped with more cheese. I ended up only using about 1/2 of the 1lb bag of cheese. More would be too much I thought. It all turned out very, very good and it was very easy.",
