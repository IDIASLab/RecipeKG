I ended up using 3 quarter pound deli sliced corned beef. Used 8 slices of Sargento's swiss cheese. An entire bottle of Wishbone's light thousand island dressing and mixed it with 1/3 cup of French's spicy brown mustard. Couldn't find rye bread crums so I baked 5 slices of rye bread separately at 350 degrees for 15 minutes to make it hardened. Broke up the bread and put it on after the mixture boiled for 10 minutes.
