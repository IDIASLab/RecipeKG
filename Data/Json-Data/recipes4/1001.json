I think the reason everyone says its so salty is because of the butter - perhaps if unsalted butter were used there would be more control over the amount of salt. I used regular (salted) butter and just a big pinch of salt and it was fine. I added an extra dollop of mayo and a squeeze of lemon juice as well. Overall I loved this and will be making it a lot. Thanks for a great new recipe!!",

I really think it's the combination of mayo parmesan and oregano that give this such a good flavor. Hubby and son had plain garlic toast. I can't wait to try this on a french baguette.
