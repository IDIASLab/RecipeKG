I would love to know where to get fresh cotechino - all I can find in Chicago is the pre-cooked and if I use that again I'm going to take it out of the foil packet and simmer it in a little broth with some chopped carrots celery and onion for a few minutes - it had a slightly \"canned\" flavor not as bright as the cotechino I've had in restaurants. Still it's a darned good meal - quitessential comfort food. We had leftovers steamed over a little broth and served with mashed potatoes and some rapini - my partner who's not a lentil fan like this better.",

I modified the recipe by creating a soffritto with the carrot onion (diced instead of chopped) garlic and 4 oz of diced pancetta. I browned the pancetta in a dutch oven then added the onion carrot and garlic allowing everything to brown and soften. Then I added the liquid (reduced to 5 cups; 2.5 cups of water and 2.5 cups of chicken broth) and seasoned with salt pepper and the bay leaf and finally the lentils. It came out well; my goal was to avoid bland lentils and this worked out very well. You can even use the broth from cooking the sausage (italian sausage works well too) to season the lentils.",
