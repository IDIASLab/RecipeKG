The only reason why I'm giving it a four star is because I took the suggestion of lemon and mayo instead of egg whites and I think it made a big difference in taste.  I sauteed 3 cloves of garlic in oil then added it to a little mayo and lemon juice until it was thin.  I then brushed that on the fish instead of the egg whites.  It was awesome and super flavorful.",

Lose the egg white and replace it with a mayo-lemon juice combo ~ I use 2 Tbsp. mayo and 2 tsp. lemon juice(just ehough to leave a hint of lemon with every bite.) Soak the fish fillets in buttermilk for about an hour before preparing to eliminate any \"fishy\" taste, add a bit more seasoning and this is a delicious, healthy meal, one which the hubs and I have been enjoying for weeks now.

I brushed the filets with melted butter and moistened the crumb mixture with it as well.  The idea of the Italian seasoning with the delicate fish didn't appeal to me, so I chose to substitute fresh minced garlic, fresh chopped dill and parsley.  I baked the fish in a shallow pan that I had drizzled with a little melted buttter.  My filets were a little thicker, so I found that 20 minutes at 400 degrees was perfect.  I love fish prepared this way and do so often.  The addition of the corn meal was new for me, however, and I can't say that I even noticed it, so I would call it unnecessary.  Served this with \"Broccoli n Tomato Pasta,\" also from this site, and a tossed green salad.  My idea of a perfect meal.",
