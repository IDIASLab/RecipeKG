I would plan about 2-3 hours for this recipe. PREP TIPS: I added brown sugar and cinnamon to enhance the flavor of the sweet potatoes. Also regarding the flour thing I think the key is to follow the recipe when adding flour to the dough. Then when you are actually rolling out the pasta make sure the surface on which you are working and your hands are well floured. This will keep it from being too sticky and ending up looking like dumplings. Also the person who said the smaller the better was VERY right. If you make the pieces of pasta large you will end up with extremely filling dough balls. If you want it to be like pasta and not dumplings you need to keep it small. I went with flat squares & rectangles about 1\" x 1\" to 1\" x 2\" (still very filling). Also I used the tofu cream sauce recipe on this site using vanilla soy milk instead of plain (to add sweetness and match the pasta) and it was awesome!! Even my husband who is not a vegetarian loved it.:)",

I think next time I'll try adding some additional flavoring to it maybe cinnamon brown sugar etc. I think anything you'd add to a sweet potato recipe would work well with this recipe.

Also I used a spaetzle maker and made the dough the consistency of spaetzle. I think this worked except that I put too much into the water at a time and possibly overcooked it making the noodles a bit mushy. As far as taste goes I had to add more salt (and I'm not a salt-aholic) and some pepper. We ate the noodles in alfredo sauce with chicken and peas as a mash-up and it was good (and colorful). This recipe has real promise. I'm going to try it again and be more careful with the boiling to see if the texture improves.",

You have to be super gentle while mixing in the flour as well. The technique (and it really IS a technique) can be seen in videos online and is important to follow so as to get light, soft gnocchi instead of dense little blobs. Another important point - don't add too much flour (again, it will become dense) and let the \"dough\" rest for 5 minutes before rolling/shaping. I strongly urge anyone to check out some videos first to make your gnocchi experience a pleasurable one!",
