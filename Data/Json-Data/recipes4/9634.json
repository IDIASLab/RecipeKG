I added some fresh garlic and a few other seasonings (I recommend just seasoning it with whatever you like, as I don't think that just paprika would be enough) and added some frozen broccoli and cauliflower when the potatoes were almost done. I also used Flounder fillets instead of Cod and Colby Jack and Parmesan cheese instead of Muenster... My mother was recently put on a diet by her doctor for her cholesterol, so I used all low fat ingredients (I can't believe it's not butter, 1% milk and low-fat/no-fat cheese) and it was still fantastic. A great way to get her to eat the fish that the doctor told her to eat! This recipe makes enough for several meals and still tastes great warmed up.",
