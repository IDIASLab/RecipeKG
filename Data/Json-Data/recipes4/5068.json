The flavors blended nicely and it smelled wonderful while it was cooking.   I cooked it on high for just under 4 hours and stirred it initially and then stirred one about half way through to blend everything and distribute liquid and had no problem with the chicken breasts drying out.   UPDATE:   I made this again and added red and green bell peppers and broccoli slaw to increase the vegetables and I doubled the spices except salt.  Since I increased the vegetables I decided to add another can of diced tomatoes and that was a mistake because then it added too much liquid.  I recommend not adding additional liquid even though it may look dry in the beginning because it makes its own sauce as it cooks.  Also, this time it seemed the additional liquid diluted the spices as it was not as flavorful as the first time even though I doubled the spices this time.   Next time I will add the additional vegetables but stick to 1 can of tomatoes and double the spices.   It is a delicious recipe.   If trying it for the first time I recommend following the recipe as written.  UPDATE II:  While eating leftovers of this recipe my husband declared this was the best dish I have made.  So it is a winner.",

Easy enough to prepare (although I halved it for 2 adults and a child), but not well received at dinnertime. My daughter and husband picked out the chicken reluctantly, and while I ate a full serving, I found myself burping the flavors of it the rest of the evening, much to my stomach's dismay. Something about that particular combo of spices and ingredients just didn't sit right w/ us. Fun to try new things though!",

I only used 1 lb boneless skinless tenderloins and did add some chicken broth when I got home as this was a tad on the dry side after that cooking time. Loved the spices I would definitely double them when making next time. I just added them to the tomatoes and juice mixed and poured over the stew.
