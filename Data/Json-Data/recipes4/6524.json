I'm from east Texas so I put some of my natural flavoring to it and actually used deer meat that I marinated in Pinot noir and balsamic. Also added black olives right before I put it in the pan to bake. Turned out amazing though! The black olives are a great touch! Good recipe though!!",

I used Shady Brook Farm's Hot Italian Turkey Sausage which is took out of the casing and broke up as I browned it.  Then I added the  pasta sauce.   I used one pound of frozen cheese tortellini cooked according to the instructions on the package.  Those three ingredients were combined and poured into the baking pan.  About one and a half cups of shredded mozzarella were used - two just seemed like too much to me.  I baked as directed in the original recipe and it came out great!  My husband really liked it, too.  I will definitely make this again.",
