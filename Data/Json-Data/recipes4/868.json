I used creamed corn because that's what I had and I used a can of Rotel instead of salsa again what I had. And I used chicken. But I thought it was a nice soup. I served it with grilled cheese. I will be sure to keep this in my collection for quick dinners or to use left over chicken. I mad it with beef too worked great! Thanks for this recipe!!",
