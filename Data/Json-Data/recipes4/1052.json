The meat also had great flavor with no trace of the tequila. My husband didn't even added steak sauce which would the the ultimate compliment. I noticed we were both drinking a lot of water after dinner though as it is a little salty. I won't bother to add the extra salt next time. I will use again for sure. However next time I will cut the recipe in at least half. This makes way too much for what we would need.",

I used beef stew meat which is good in the slow cooker but only so-so on the grill. Don't be scared off by the amount of tequila it's not the dominant flavor. Instead of the pepper I used a can of chopped green chilies and let my beef marinate for 2 days. Thanks for sharing.",

I added a few things of my own and made some substitutions because I didn't have all ingredients. Since Cinco was just a few days ago I had some limes lying around so I thought I add some lime juice (with Tequila how could you not add lime)and I also added minced garlic. I didn't have a jalepeno so I used dried red pepper flakes to give it some spice.
