Needs more seasoning.\"Gotta say that for the ease of prep (and I used a bag of coleslaw mix for the cabbage, making this even easier!) this was nice, comfort food. Had a bite while it was simmering and ended up adding probably 1/2 tsp. more Italian seasoning, along w/ 1/4 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. celery seed, and heavy s&p, as it was a bit lacking in flavor department. (We usually eat our cabbage moosh-mosh dishes w/ kielbasa rather than ground beef, which gives it more flavor, so this just kinda needed a kick. The other kick we gave it was some Sriracha sauce at the table.) Makes a ton, even though I dropped the meat to a pound and the tomatoes to one can, but the leftovers were equally as good, and I imagine that it would also freeze well too.",

                "reviewBody": "12-4-2017  ~ I\u2019ve turned out some pretty good things in the kitchen strictly with the purpose in mind of using limited ingredients at hand.  This was the case here.  I suppose I\u2019m unusual for routinely going back and forth from our homes in Wisconsin and in Naples, FL with boxes of produce cleared out from the fridge that I don\u2019t want to waste.  The particular head of cabbage I used for this dish today made the journey here twice, and I was determined NOT to pack it in a suitcase for the third time!  I started out by saut\u00e9ing a few strips of chopped bacon, then cooked the onions in the bacon fat.  This, I knew, would add another dimension of flavor.  Not a fan of \u201cItalian seasoning,\u201d I seasoned it up with a couple of cloves of fresh minced garlic rather than garlic powder (had the garlic in the suitcase too), basil, oregano, Worcestershire sauce, and Montreal Steak Seasoning - and a couple extra globs of butter didn\u2019t hurt either.  I added fresh mushrooms (yep, brought down here with me in the suitcase).  I eliminated the red pepper flakes, the added bite not being necessary for me.  This is simple, home cooked comfort food, good as is, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with embellishing it a bit. I found this \u201cSuitcase Supper\u201d quite pleasant and very satisfying. Note:  Ideally I think this would be even better with the addition of some rice, but since I restrict carbs I restrained myself from that enticing option.",

Just want to say that I am glad there are reviews that show what people do differently because it really helps to cater to the different tastes in my family.  So, on that note... I added mild Italian sausage with ground chicken and I use real garlic instead of the powder.  Added some shredded carrots and followed the rest of the recipe.  I love the idea of rice, but hubby doesn't, so I made that on the side for whoever wanted to add it.  I don't usually measure my seasonings, I add to taste and it turned out delicious.

Even though I accidentally added extra Italian seasoning, it was very bland and the sauce was thin and watery.  I was expecting a thicker savory sauce.  I think maybe there should have been two cans of tomato sauce with one can of tomatoes, and maybe some tomato paste.  With the leftovers, I'm going to add some rice to thicken up the sauce and maybe some Worchestershire sauce, smoked paprika and more garlic to see if that helps.  I'd really thought this would be more like stuffed cabbage, but sauce is just way too watery and flavorless - it leaves an unappealing watery puddle when you spoon it over rice.
