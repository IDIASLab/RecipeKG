Slice and lay the slices out on a rack or paper towel or towel, lightly salt the slices to draw the MOISTURE out (this is what makes it soggy) rinse off after an hour or two, and then pat dry, finish the recipe and the chips will be a whole lot crisper. \nLearned that when I made Moussaka the first time, and it works with tomatoes for tomato pie. This will make crisper zucchini chips as well.",

I only used seasoned breadcrumbs and parm cheese. I dipped them in this mixture after dipping them in the egg. I oiled a pan and placed them on there then I drizzled the eggplant with oil. I baked for 15-20 minutes and turned over and let cook the same amount of time. I then turned the oven to 425 and cooked for another 5 minutes or so. They were nice and crisp even after cooling. They were also firm and not mushy. I hope this helps.",

In addition I used a little hand slicer to get nice and even 1/8\" slices. I used two cookie sheets flipping slices and swapping racks 20 minutes into the 325 degree setting. Then an additional 20 minutes. Then about 8 minutes at 425. But I did get a little burning on some pieces. So my timing was probably a little too long. I also think it's important to do this in a gas oven. But I feel that in general for anything that is baked. I only have a gas oven so I'm not sure how this would turn out in an electric oven. But I have a feeling it wouldn't be as good as gas.",
