The food coloring wasn't necessary. This paired perfectly with Sea Bass Cuban Style, the recipe also from this site.",

I sauteed the onions and sausage for about 2-3 minutes in 3 tbs. butter, then added the other 3 tbs. butter and the rice, I let the rice brown a bit, then I added the water and used italian seasoning instead of parsley and a few sprinkles of adobo instead of saffron and food coloring.  I also added a few manzanilla olives and then I let it come to a boil and then simmered for 20 minutes.  Absolutely delicious!!

I used 1/2 a small onion & olive oil instead of butter ( 2 Tbsp.) also chicken stock not water cause that's what I usually do. I did crush the saffron a bit into the stock & heated it in the microwave before adding it to the pan of rice. Hubs & I really liked this we both cleaned our plates. If you have the saffron give it a try. Didn't use any coloring-it was nice & golden by itself.",
