Spices, I'll usually add basil, fennel, thyme. If you've got a little bacon grease in your fridge, saute your vegetables in that before you add the rest of your ingredients.

I used shell noodles instead of macaroni and cooked it seperately and then added it to the hamburger/tomato mixture so I left out the 2 cups of water. I used a package of beefy onion soup mix since that is what I had on hand. I also cut back on the oregano since my canned tomatoes were already seasoned with basil garlic and oregano.
