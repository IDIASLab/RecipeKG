Using red potatoes I have made this exactly as the recipe suggested with a just bit of sharp cheddar on top and another time added venison sausage - both times were great. This does not have the \"canned\" taste I was expecting. I like to mash the potato cubes just enough to \"roughen\" them up - the addition of the soup and cheese give plenty of creaminess without having to mash up the potatoes too much. Thanks so much to the contributor! On to my second helping....",
