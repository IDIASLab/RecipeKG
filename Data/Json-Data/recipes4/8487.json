I used leftover taco meat that I had added black beans to and also added some cooked white rice to the stuffing mixture to make it go a little further. It made two pans full! Other than the additions, I made it as is using canned corn and Mexican blend shredded cheese and it turned out great. I also skipped the olives for taste preference. I will be making this again soon. It's a great recipe if you're looking for something new to try with ground beef.",

Technically we could have just picked them up and eaten them with our hands which makes me think they would be a great finger food for parties and things of that nature. The shell stayed pretty firm and had a nice snap to it. These were easy to make and easy to stuff which is a plus in my book!",
