I also used fresh spinach, only because my family dosen't care for the texture/taste of frozen. We like our sauce a little thicker, so this was perfect for us. We had this over buttered hot thin whole wheat spaghetti tossed with parmesan cheese. We all inhaled it. This recipe is perfect for times like this, when you have an abundance of wonderful homegrown produce and items you can buy cheaply. Not a whole lot of money was put out, even to cook it! NOTE: If you have small kids like we do, set out the red pepper flake on the table to add for the big folks. If you add as much as the recipe calls for, you'll have unhappy kids.",
