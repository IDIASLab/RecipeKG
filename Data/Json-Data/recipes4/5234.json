I used the ingredients listed but altered the directions somewhat. I combined the steps of browning the mushrooms garlic and asparagus for 8 minutes - removed from pan and set aside in a bowl and then fried the bacon in the same pan - why dirty another pan? All of the flavors blended well together and we especially enjoyed the appearance and crunchiness of the asparagus. This is a recipe in which the ingredients could be added or taken from to satisfy indiviudal taste. Thanks for sharing your recipe here on Allrecipes smerki!",

I removed the bacon and then added onions and red bell pepper in place of the mushrooms (don t care for them) garlic s/p and the asparagus. I just saut\u00e9ed all of it until the asparagus was tender with brown spots. I then assembled in the order listed baked at 400 for 14 minutes.
