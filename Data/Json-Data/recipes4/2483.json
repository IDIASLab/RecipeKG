I also increased the garlic to 2 cloves and it wasn't a bit overpowering.  As other reviewers did, I added some spices - generous shake of pumpkin pie spice (cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg).  By leaving out some of the liquid ingredients, I ended up with just a little nice sauce at the bottom.   Adding the apple really mellows the taste of the chicken broth.  We ate it all on its own; no rice or bread.  Great  fall recipe.  My husband and I really loved it!  With extra veggies & fruit and without the cream, it feels healthy too!",

Since everyone talked about how watery this dish was I cut back the liquid to one cup and about 3/4 cup wine plus I put in 3/4 cup uncooked rice to help soak up the fluid and to make it more of a casserole. About 30 min. into the cooking it was getting quite dry so I added in another 3/4 cup liquid salt/pepper and let it cook for another 15 min. This was beautiful!! My only comment for next time is that I will try and use a dryer wine. I only had a Sav so that's what I used but I think it made it a bit more sweet....Overall a great dish and something different!!",
