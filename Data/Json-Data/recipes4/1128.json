I combined the parmesan basil oregano and olives and just drizzled with enough olive oil to moisten the mixture. For two little sandwiches I thought the amount of basil and oregano (used fresh) might be too much so I scaled that back. I spread it on the bread and layered the rest of the ingredients using only the provolone and no mozzarella. I wanted this to be a warm sandwich so I wrapped the loaf in non-stick foil and baked at 350 for about 20 minutes. Great sandwich!! We ll look forward to doing this one again! Thanks Mary48!!",
