You could easily tweak this with ingredients you like. I sometimes add crushed red pepper, other times I add dried minced garlic, or fresh minced herbs. The sky's the limit really! This last time I did half butter, half truffle oil - delicious!!! This recipe makes 8 very small side servings, so plan accordingly.",

Different noodles make a different taste texture, soo experiment with the noodles NOT this sauce.  Thank you as always  and I make this ALL the time. Always a crowd pleaser.  Cheers  from N.V.",
