Made half the recipe and included one potato (didn't want to break open a whole zucchini for 1/2 c) and I don't think that changed the taste a lot.  They were delicious!  Puffed up a bit, added mozzarella (would've been better if fresh) and some banana legs tomatoes from the garden to garnish.  Thanks for a great recipe!  You could totally add some different seasonings to spice things up a bit!",

Both times I used 1/2 Whole Wheat White flour and 1/2 AP Flour. The second time I baked them in the oven at 425 for 7 mins flipped them and cooked for another 7 mins. Still delicious and healthier. They also toast up real well as leftovers!",
