The Penn Station version uses melted provolone instead of parmesan, which you are welcome to do, but the parmesan adds more flavor than the provolone without the added fat!  Also, feel free to add mayo as you like.  I think it has plenty of goodness without!",

In stead of making these on a french baguette I made these an open faced sandwich! All I did was lightly toast some bread and cook the artichokes and mushrooms as described. When the artichoke/mush mixture was done I topped the toast with a quarter of the mixture and threw it back into the oven for 5 minutes or so. Some additions that will be made next time: I will probably add some type of shredded cheese to the top when baking in the oven. I will also probably add some french fried onions to the top as well. overall this was a GREAT vegetarian (you could even make this vegan by replacing the parmesan cheese with nutritional yeast) meal. It is a very satisfying meal!",
