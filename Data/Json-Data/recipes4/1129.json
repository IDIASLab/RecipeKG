Pretty much followed the recipe except I used a half pound of lamb and made the 18 wedges with a tad left over!  Go figure. This is a good tip about using puff pastry. Do not bear down on the edges as it will not puff up as well. \nRoll with a light hand and reduce pressure on the edges.  I also baked at 400* @ 15 minutes. I do have a convection oven so that might make a difference in performance.  This is definitely a keeper!",

Unless everyone else was using ridiculously small onions, each off my onions yield about a cup. I used one onion (or one cup of onions). I used a jalape\u00f1o because our store did not seem to have green chili peppers. The spices and taste of the meat was excellent. Unfortunately my next problem came with the pastry sheets. Cutting them into nine squares made for a very small bit of dough that definitely did not even fit a tablespoon of meat in. Not a single one of my triangles could hold shape. If I try this again I will cut the sheet into quarters so each triangle can actually have a decent amount of meat and close up properly.",
