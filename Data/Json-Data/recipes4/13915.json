I cooked the rice in chicken broth instead of water and seasoned it lightly. I also dribbled the pan drippings over the finished hen too for a finishing touch.",

Check the internal temp of Stuffing not bird. Juices should run clear. It should read 165 F. Put the birds on a wire rack..setting on base of pan will cause inadequate roasting.
