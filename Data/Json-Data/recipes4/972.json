I've sent them along with my husband in the cooler for fishing trips, the guys LOVE them cold right out of the cooler! One thing I can suggest to make them easier is to not worry about the shape of your finished puff. By the time they rise in the oven they are all pretty symmetrical. Just be careful not to get the filling on the outside and be sure to pich the seals together good.",

( I do not add butter to the cream cheese just with the onions to saute and then just poor it all into the crm chz mixture) Add to chicken in a bowl with 1 large cream cheese and mix together, then bundle them in the crescents.

Also, line your pans with parchment paper for easier cleanup, should you have any leaks. I make these with the chicken, onion and garlic, and then add frozen chopped spinach (defrosted and squeezed dry), mixed with parmesan cheese and enough mayonnaise to moisten. I don\u2019t use cream cheese or butter. I often use a Calzone filling, of onion, bell pepper and crumbled Italian sausage (cooked & well drained) mixed with pizza sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese. Cubed ham, broccoli and Swiss cheese is also good. You can substitute just about any combination of cooked meat, vegetables and cheese, mixed with enough mayonnaise, sour cream, or any type of sauce to moisten; even creamed soup (undiluted)) will work. Served with a salad, makes a nice dinner or cut into quarters for an appetizer. And don\u2019t forget dessert, use fresh fruit, sliced and mixed with sweetened cream cheese. Drizzle baked and cooled puffs with a simple powdered sugar glaze. The possibilities are endless!",
