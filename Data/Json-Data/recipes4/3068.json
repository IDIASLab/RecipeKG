Enjoy with a wine of your choice, keeping in mind that this dish is quite spicy and has the tang of the preserved lemon. Personally I'd prefer a medium white such as chardonnay or even a Mosel. A mild to sweet red wine would also be great.",

This is an excellent way! The lemon and garlic truly accent the lamb and gave it a very exotic flavor. Even hubby who is not always crazy about lamb thought it was bone-sucking good! I'm going to try it with a venison backstrap as well...since a deer is little more than a suped up sheep. Great idea!!!",
