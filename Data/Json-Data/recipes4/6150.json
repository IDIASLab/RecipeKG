I used apple butter rather than jelly as it was what we had on hand and the glaze turned out delicious. This is becoming one of our go-to recipes when we need something simple.",

I melted the jelly in the microwave just a bit, to make it easier to glaze the chicken.  Hubby grilled in on the gas grill, we heated up the glaze to make it safe to eat and used it as a sauce.
