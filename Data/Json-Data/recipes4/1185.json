Try tossing the cut up chicken in a little Italian dressing.  I like the idea of quartering my vegetables instead and adding vidalia onion.  I seasoned the veggies with garlic salt, pepper, and oregano.  I also used a can of petite cut tomatoes instead , so you get a little bit with evey bite.  I used colby-jack cheese- instead -just 1 cup and then sprinkled a little shredded parmesan over that.  The results were incredible.  I did have a lot of juice too from vegetables and chicken cooking.  I took out several T. and then served garlic bread with the meal for \"soaking\" up the juices.  This is a new favorite for us and is a light dish to serve!",

My chicken breasts were in pieces but it worked fine. I added some olive oil oregano garlic powder on the chicken and italian seasonings. I used the can of tomatoes like it called for but on top I sliced up fresh tomatoes and covered with oregano. I might change it up to add fresh tomatoes throughout because that made it really yummy. I changed the cheese to monterey jack which worked fine. I added some fresh garlic too. Next time I'll add mushrooms & an onion. It was really yummy.",

One of the things that should be worked on is what happens if you add ingredients like thin sliced potatoes or carrots. Also how about some spices here?!

I wish I had some fresh 'shrooms but I didn't. I seasoned everything with some McCormick Roasted Garlic & Bell Pepper seasoning along with salt and pepper and a bit on Garlic and Herb Mrs. Dash. I let it cook for about half an hour without the cheese and then checked it to see how the veggies were coming. There was quite a bit of juice so I added some grated parm and mixed it in a bit then put it back in for about 10 minutes. I added some shredded asiago the last 5 minutes just to melt (I was out of mozzarella). I served it with some fresh italian bread with garlic butter and it was perfect!
