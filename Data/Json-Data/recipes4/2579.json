Alos top Chefs recommend equal quantities of eggs, flour and milk (semi skimmed is supposed to be the best). The reason for the equal quantities is the fact that eggs can vary by as much as 20 gms per egg. Hope these tips help.",

I have used the same recipe for many years, but read all the reviews so decided to give this one a try.  These were just as good, as long as you add a pinch of salt (I know we are all trying to cut down on of salt intake, but Yorkshire puddings are not the same without it).  The other points I wanted to mention is to make sure your ingredients are at room temperature before you begin and when mixing, make as fluffy as you can, the more air you get into the mixture the better.  My Grandma always told me to let the batter sit for a good 20 minutes before putting into the pans.  This has always worked well for me.",
