You can garnish the soup when serving with a little sour cream, cooked, crumbled bacon, grated cheddar cheese, or chopped chives.",

I modified it slightly by adding a can of chicken broth before adding the rest of the water, but otherwise did not add or change anything.  I cooked it on low for 5 hours which was more than sufficient and used a potato masher instead of dragging out my blender and dirtying another item.  This left a few minor chunks of potato in the soup which added to its consistency.  I definitely recommend this recipe.",

Yesterday was the first time I tried putting it through the blender cold and it was awful! What a terrible texture - all lumpy and grainy. I'd definitely recommend blending it hot very carefully. DO NOT FILL THE BLENDER TOO FULL! Half way should be good. Another option is to use one of those blender wand things and blend it right in the pot. The texture is much better then. Thanks to all who have reviewed this recipe so far! I hope many of you enjoy this soup as much as I do.",
