Second, I found additional broth preferable to the water called for.  I also chose to use baby spinach rather than kale.  Finally, the potatoes need only about 15 minutes to cook thoroughly, not a total of 37 (!), while the pasta needs a good 10 minutes to cook, not a mere five (!), so I adjusted the cooking time accordingly.  As this recipe's first reviewer I'm pleased to report that overall, this was very good.  I had planned to serve this with salad and bread, but found both unnecessary as the soup on its own was very hearty and satisfying.",

I normally don't like tomato-based soups, but because we had kale, carrots, potatoes, and squash from our garden, I thought I'd give this a try.  I had to make a couple of substitutions since it was sort of a last-minute recipe choice: sweet Italian chicken sausage, garbanzo beans, and millet instead of pasta.   I doubt any of these things changed the flavor much from the original...and the flavor was so good!  My husband loved it without the Parmesan, and my teenager and I loved it with the Parmesan.  I'm so glad this made a big batch.  We will thoroughly enjoy having leftovers.",
