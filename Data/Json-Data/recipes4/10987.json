Lots of sour cream and eggs in this one. this a keeper and I see myself making this one a lot...I may even try to come up with a vanilla or red velvet version! ADDENDUM.....I tried a vanilla version...yellow cake mix vanilla pudding mix same amount of eggs sour cream oil and water. Still used the choc chips. DELISH!!!!!!!!",
