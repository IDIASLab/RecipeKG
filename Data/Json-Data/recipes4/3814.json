Whenever I make homemade pancakes it makes a ton - enough to freeze a few for a future date. This was perfect to thaw a few and assemble these sandwiches. I made one with bacon and one with sausage. I can't wait to try a version with ham. No matter what kind of breakfast meat you use this is bound to be good and not to mention filling! I used real maple syrup that I placed on the side for dipping - De-lish! Thanks for the great recipe tiffany13!",

Like, best mom ever great. I didn't have any ham on hand but I did have leftover cooked bacon that I used instead. I also used homemade whole-wheat pancakes, too. My kids are \"dippers\" so I just had a little syrup on the side and cut the \"sandwiches\" into fourths for easy dipping. NOTE: I've made this many times now, also with thin homemade breakfast sausage patties, and it's always a hit--especially with my truck-driving husband, who can't wait around in the morning for a hot breakfast. I can easily pre-cook the ingredients for this, assemble it, and wrap it in a paper towel for him to warm in the microwave before he heads out in the morning. EXCELLENT idea.",

Why pay 3-4 to get a hot piping fresh one at McD's when you can save money and make them at home. I did so for 4 kids I saved so much money in doing so. And didn't waste nothing. They were quick and excellent. I ended up using up some frozen items that I had saved in my freezer in making this and my calorie count for these were lower then the recipes count. I used Walmart Brand pancakes Kraft Fat-Free Slice Cheese Hormel Natural Choice Ham TimberRidge Scrambled Egg Patties & Sugar Free Maple Grove Syrup total calories was 355 41g carbs 11.5g fat 25g protein....Now looking at this...wow on calories and carbs but on a cold day that might be needed. On the protein factor...AWESOME. But as the recipe stands...we will make again because it was simple quick and the overall usage of using up leftovers is by far a bonus. I'm pretty sure I can make low carb pancakes and store in the freezer that would totally bring down that part of carbs and calories to boot. But for time budget and the overall satisfaction in this recipe...is a total winner for my kids. Thanks Tiffany...I will keep this recipe as a staple for my leftovers.",

Like another reviewer said each ingredient on its own was great but I think I was expecting something different. However it's filling and I enjoyed it. I think the other ingredients overpowered the taste of the pancakes and I missed that particular taste. I did use cherry jam instead of maple syrup which I didn't have and I must have done myself a disservice from what others are saying. I will definitely try again with maple syrup and other variations of meat and cheese.",
