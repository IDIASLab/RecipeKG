Oh my...so tasty moist! I am NOT a big fish fan (especially if it tastes \"fishy\") so I never thought I would eat the whole fillet (and it was very big; 7-8 inches). I surprised myself and my husband and ate the whole thing!! Yay!! (but I do have one question...what the heck is the teaspoon of butter for?!Nowhere in the directions is the butter mentioned so I omitted that ingredient) Yummy yummy yummy!! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. I'm gonna share with my family and friends!",
