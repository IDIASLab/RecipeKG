It looked pretty, but I can't say I noticed a difference in the taste.  It didn't have a noticable cranberry taste.  My grocery store didn't have pot roast, only tri-tip roast (it was on sale) so I used that.  After putting my roast in the crockpot I chopped up the onion, but also added a couple of teaspoons of chopped garlic, baby carrots, and sliced mushrooms (there was no more room for potatoes.)  Approximately 3 1/2 hours later the roast was done.  I turned down the crockpot to low.  I cut up potatoes and added more baby carrots to a seperate pot.  I laddled the liquid from the crockpot into my pot of potatoes and carrots and boiled them for about 15 minutes.  All the vegetables tasted delicious and I couldn't tell which had cooked in the crockpot and which had cooked on the stove.  I invited my parents over for dinner and everyone loved it.  The meat was moist and tender and everything had a touch of sweetness.  Even the kids had seconds.",
