The only thing I do differently is buy the roast already cut into thin 'steaks' because my grocery store sells it like that and it makes life easier for me lol. These are very good and I like to serve them either with pasta lasagna or stuffed shells or just with rice or mashed potaotes and a salad and veggie. Definately give these a try you won't be disappointed!:)",

My meat was already thin. It just sat there in the oil. It was a mess. The flavor was bland. My fiance's mother made this before and this recipe tastes NOTHING like hers... I think I'll stick with her recipe. I don't want to sund rude but I am very dissatisfied... I will try to make again maybe with a different type of meat. I just don't think breaded crumbs is for beef at all. Thanks tho. If it turns up better next time I will rate high and try to edit this.",
