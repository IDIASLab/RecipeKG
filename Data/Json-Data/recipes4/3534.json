Very rich tasting. I found it had to bake longer, though. Would love to try it with real crab when I can splurge.\n\nUpdate: 8 years out from my original review and this is still a favorite meal in our home. I\u2019ve upped the egg count to 4, and I\u2019ve taken to pulsing the krab in a food processor as it\u2019s much faster. I recommend flake-style krab if you go that route, and I do go heavy on the old bay. \n\nTo the person who originally posted this recipe - Thank you for years of delicious and easy dinners!",
