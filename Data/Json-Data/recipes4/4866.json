I took that person's advice and did not add the toasted spices so early in the process but I don't know if that made a difference. But the chicken was finished well before the potatoes. In fact we gave up on them likely about 20 minutes after the chicken was done. One option would be to microwave the potatoes some first. However to me even though we added all those spices I tasted mostly the cayenne pepper. My boyfriend on the other hand said the dish was bland. He suggested the dish would be better slow cooked so the spices can get into the chicken and the potatoes. So perhaps that would help. But as written I would never make it again. I love Indian food and with all the Indian spices I had high hopes though.",

Might be because I used whole cloves instead of ground? Also when toasting the spices I almost warn against this. If you do burn them I think that could add bitterness. Also...when adding the onions the spices dry up all the oil so it makes it very difficult to get a good sweat on them. toast spices spearately and saute the chicken in the onions and garlic first before adding the spices. Technical flaws galore in this dish.",
