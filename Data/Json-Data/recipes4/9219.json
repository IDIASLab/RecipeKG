This recipe was flavorful but I prefer a much crispier crunchier dressing. After releasing the pressure I poured the mixture into a 9x13 and baked at 400F for about 15 minutes and it was still soggier than I care for. If you like your dressing soft then you will love this! Only ingredient change I made was using bulk breakfast sausage instead of Italian which I think works best for dressing.",
