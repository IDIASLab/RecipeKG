I did cut the recipe in half to use up some fingerling potatoes that we had boiled the night before for dinner. I also used just a few tablespoons of \"real bacon\" pieces (you know the kind you can buy already cooked in pieces to use to top a salad). I think the amount of bacon in the recipe would be way too much for the amount of potatoes personally. I would also add that these are best served to almost room temperature.",
