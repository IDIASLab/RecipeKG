Pay attention all...do NOT add the entire 1 1/2 cups of regular parmesan cheese, you must use the Italian Blend shredded cheese with the Asiago in it.  Then add pepper to this recipe as well.  I use more garlic and the imitation crab meat, plus 2 cans of crab meat, and I do add lump crab meat. If I am going to eat something this fattening, then it better be darn good!  So, read the reviews from others and take warning regarding their add-ins.  They are speaking with experience.",

Allrecipes I love you guys but occasionally you do get carried away. As for the serving issue I guess this is in the eye of the beholder. This may make enough to generously dip about 40 tortilla chips and one chip might be considered one serving. I agree with Noel though. I want to know how many people will politely get a few dipped chips to fill the hollow spot with their beers during Superbowl halftime. As for the recipe I only had one can of real crab. I was also confused by the widely varying reviews about the out of whack ingredient ratios. Not needing to make a lot I used half the mayo and half the sour cream and about cup of grated Parmesan. I halved the garlic cause hubby likes it mild. I sprinkled it with a little paprika for color before baking. We ate this on Ritz crackers (oh sorry Allrecipes will probably edit me to be politically correct I meant buttery round crackers). It was a yummy cheese spread but it didn t exude much crabbiness. A couple of more cans of crabmeat wouldn t have hurt. Thanks Noel. I ll make this again but I had to jot down my own notes so I could duplicate it.",

Used about 6-8 oz of imitation crab meat (I know, I know, fresh is better but for a large party, it will definitely do). 2. Combined 8 oz 1/3 less fat cream cheese, 1/2 c Lite Miracle Whip, 3/4-1 c grated Parmesan/Romano cheese, and 1 cup lite sour cream.  3. Added 3 sliced green onions (green parts only) - a little more than 1/4 cup.  4. Added in 1 tsp worchestershire sauce, 1 tsp of old bay seasoning, and at least 1/4 tsp of pepper (eye-balled it).  I'm a little convinced it is probably just fine without the worchestershire sauce/old bay so I wouldn't run out to buy them if you're short on funding.  5.  Finely diced two LARGE cloves of garlic instead of crushing them.  My cloves probably equaled four smaller ones.  6.  Baked in a 8X8 square pyrex dish and served with slices of Italian bread!",
