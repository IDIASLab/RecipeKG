Since the cooking method is really the key to this dish, it would have been nice to have more complete instructions on what size pan and how to arrange the meat in it. I think most of us assumed to bake it in a shallow dish arranged in one layer. I more than doubled this recipe (btw, you don't need quite twice the rub - had a little too much) and didn't want to use two dishes, so I baked it in my 8-qt dutch oven. I didn't quite have room to single layer and my pork was pretty snug in there. Turned out perfect in 2 hours! For anyone who has trouble with this dish drying out, try shortening the cooking time and/or snuggling your meat cubes closer in the pan. Thanks so much for the recipe!",

I bake it in 9X13 dish (with a little olive oil to prevent sticking) at 325 for about 45 minutes. NOTE: This rocks with cubed\nchicken breasts (**remember, just 2 tsps\nchile powder).

So what I did was use cubed pork chops instead of pork tenderloin cut up into 1 inch cubes. I did follow the recipe spices and marinate time. Cooked the cubes over the stovetop in a little bit of olive oil - served it over the top of Robyn Webb's \"Black Beans and Rice\" (on this site as well though I did alter that recipe as well (look for my review to see the alterations)) with corn and chopped fresh red & green bell peppers on the side to cut the bite of the beans & rice. Excellent! Great idea to use the cilantro - such a wonderful fresh herb. Thanks for the recipe! Will be keeping & using it often. =)",

I didn't have alot of time on hand so I skipped the marinating stage and instead boiled the meat in a pot with chicken soup base for about 15 minutes to tenderize it. I then drained the meat and mixed it with the spice blend. I oiled a baking pan with olive oil and baked 300F for half an hour. It smelled great, but I still found it dry and lacking something to make it scream \"delicious\". I served it on a bed of plain white rice and a side of cheesy brocoli. I did add some dijonaise and tabasco to try and make the meat juicy, but failed. I probably won't make this dish again unless there is a way to make sort of a sauce so it isn't so dry.",
