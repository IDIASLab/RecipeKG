I make the following changes:  Use two 6oz cans salmon instead of one 7oz can (or two pre-drained 3oz packets).  Add garlic.  Use lime juice instead of lemon pepper - makes a huge difference in the taste.  Also add frozen onions and green bell peppers.  Before cooking I spray each patty once on each side with spray butter which makes them brown nicely.  To be healthier, you can substitute spray olive oil if you can find it.  I followed another's advice and make a sauce with mayo, lime juice & dill for dipping.  Like I said, these come out consistently fantastic.  I have served these at dinner parties with many compliments & my husband asks me to make these at least once a week!",

I did not add as much of the crushed crackers, but I did add some fresh ground pepper, garlic, and parsley. I did not have green onions so I used finely chopped yellow onion. My kids do like fish most of the time and they ate two of these each. Good recipe for canned salmon. Thanks.",

These salmon cakes were VERY hard to keep together and when they came out of the oven, they were VERY dry. Even the sauce I made to serve with it couldn't save it. The grownups didn't like it at all but funny enough, the kids loved it. Three stars based on that alone.",

They're a favorite with everyone we share them with.   I grate my onion instead of chopping (1/2 small onion) and also add 2 tablespoons lemon juice.
