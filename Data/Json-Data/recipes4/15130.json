        "description": "Grandpa sends me veggies from his huge garden every year and I use 'em for this soup, which has been called 'the best soup I've ever eaten' by friends. It's pretty unstructured and can change to meet your personal tastes. It's basically a chicken veggie soup; it's the FRESH veggies that make it the best. I just throw stuff in until it looks and tastes the way I want it to. It's also GREAT if you're sick; I swear it'll cure what ails ya! YUM! The longer you SLOWLY cook the soup, the more flavorful it becomes. I often eat a bowl while it's simmering 'cause I can't wait.",

I guess after sitting and all the ingredients integrating over time was just what this recipe needed!! My 7 month old who is barely eating baby food loved this!!! I mashed it up a bit and he can't get enough!! Yum!! I broke the recipe into thirds too. Two frozen containers for dinner two later times and one third now. Yum!",
