Stick to the recipe, please don't alter it, then rate it, as its no longer mine. \n\nDo not over work the dough, flatten out gently, dust lightly with flour, (will be sticky) pat gently and then fold again, repeat, you should only do it 4-5 times max, any more and your dough will comes out flat, dense, and chewy.  \n\nIf they don't turn out like that, you more than likely overworked the dough, or need fresh baking powder/soda  \n\nThese rise about an inch on avg.\n\nRemember the key is, handle the dough as lightly and as little as possible.  \n\nA Tip:  To make buttermilk just add a 1 tbs of white vinegar to a cup of milk. Let sit for 5 minutes, and you now have buttermilk.  \n\nTo keep the lard/butter from clumping, grate directly over the flour moving it around as you grate and give a little stir if you see it clumping. \n\nBTW Grandma always sifted her flour, I did not,  \n\nI've eaten a lot of country food. This is the best biscuits I've ever had.  If yours don't turn out delicious, please try again, as something went wrong.  It's worth it.  Btw- These biscuits should be soft in the middle and have a very light crunch on the top. Grandma's words about biscuits, it largely comes down to feel and texture of the biscuit when it is kneaded perfectly with the right moisture to flour ratio and that comes only with a little practice. Enjoy! WARNING: this is NOT health food,   Please judge solely on taste.",

                "reviewBody": "I have made these biscuits twice now - both times within ONE week! Originally, I am Southern-raised from NC, now living in CA, and I had been looking for some good old-fashioned Southern buttermilk biscuits to make for myself since they are basically nowhere to be found in Northern California. I stumbled across this recipe and couldn't wait to try it! I made a few substitutions - namely, instead of lard, I used 100% vegetable shortening. The first time, I made these exactly as the recipe stated. I was pleased overall with the consistency and the texture of them - just as the recipe described - but I felt it was missing something for my personal taste - namely, I thought the taste was a bit too... floury. I wanted more of a melt-in-your-mouth buttery flavor. The second time I made these, I used way more butter than shortening, in fact, I nearly doubled the amount of butter that I put into them (hey, I'm from the South - I enjoy my buttery buttermilk biscuits!) and they turned out phenomenally! In retrospect, I realized that I should have perhaps bought and used butter-flavored shortening instead of flavorless, but that's what recipes are for - trial and error. I highly recommend using mostly butter in them, however, because the flavor is so moist, decadent, and reminds you of home. I froze my butter and shortening beforehand and just used a cheese grater to grate the desired quantities into the recipe. I highly recommend doing that, as well - the biscuits come out so fluffy.",

I saw the submitter's suggestion to add two teaspoons of baking powder which is good because if I hadn't seen that, I don't think they'd have turned out as well. The bacon drippings was genius--it added just a hint of bacon flavor that really made these biscuits good! We all loved these and there are no leftovers. Next time, I might omit the lard and just use bacon drippings. That was a money idea. Thanks, Greg!",

No, its not health food, or gluten free, or made with canola oil, but man if you love authentic southern style biscuits, these are it!!  I'm scratching my head at some of these reviews though, they rave about the flavor, then complain about the ingredients used.  Which is downright silly and a bit unfair to the submitter since it clearly list the ingredient, the fat content, the calorie count and everything else.   This is truly southern style, in the south we use lard, and lots of butter and salt. If you want healthy biscuits, I suggest people do a search for HEALTHY/GLUTEN Free Biscuits.  Grandma Mary would be proud of these.  One thing I noticed though, make sure that butter and lard are frozen hard, else its going to stick to the grater.  I'm going to go scoop up a bunch of  tbs of lard and keep it in my freezer now.  This is now a new Sunday Brunch tradition.  I wish I could give this 10 stars, they really are that good.  Thanks Greg!! I've been looking for this recipe for 20 years!!  After using this site for the last 6 months in a lurking state, I felt so compelled to rate these biscuits, I had to sign up to let people know, this is the biscuit recipe your looking for and they really are easy and fool proof if you follow the recipe.",
