I found that when I cooked it at the reccommended temp, the coconut burned before the fish was cooked.  By covering the fish during cooking, then uncovering and broiling at the end to brown and crisp coating, I think that problem could be solved.  I served it with caribbean rice (from Zattarain's) and a salad.  The rice and salmon go well together!!!",

I used two tbs of canola oil instead of the non stick spray and I thought 425 was too hot so I cooked the fish at 395 and flipped it over halfway through! I'm sure its excellent with the panko breadcrumbs so I need to try that next time!",
