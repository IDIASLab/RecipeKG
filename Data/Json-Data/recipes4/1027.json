I ended up using a red onion instead of green onion (didn't have green onion on hand).  I added some fresh garlic and fresh ginger, I think this is important actually.  And then I marinated for a few hours in a dish (turning salmon around once, so that all parts got some marinating time).  And as for flavor, I think it is VERY important to take the leftover marinade and boil/reduce it in a small pan, and put the marinade on as a sauce on top of the salmon when eating.  The marinade is very very flavorful, and you need to eat it on top as a sauce, to really taste it well on the salmon.  I will definitely be doing this more often.  Oh, and I used a boneless fillet of salmon, grilling 10 minutes (5  minutes per side) on medium/high heat.  Delicious, thank you for the recipe!",
