The only change I made was to spread half a can of sauerkraut in the dish before adding the rolls, and spread the other half on top of the rolls.  Add 1 cup of water to the dish, pour over the tomato sauce and sprinkle a teaspoon of caraway seeds over the top.  Cover and bake for 1 hour 15 minutes.  And there you have it!  You have just changed Polish Cabbage Rolls into Hungarian Stuffed Cabbage!  The sauerkraut makes all the difference in the world!",

The filling of the cabbage rolls is spot on for using ground turkey! I used a little too much marjoram but it was not overwhelming. We really enjoyed these cabbage rolls. To save some time I cooked the rice in my rice cooker earlier in the day. 2 2 lb ground turkey and 1 medium-large? head cabbage yielded 18 rolls of varying sizes for us. To bake I placed the really small leaves of the cabbage in the bottom of the prepared baking dish (no waste here) and placed the rolls on top. I would rate the cabbage rolls as written 5 stars. The only reason why I m rating 4 stars is because of the sauce. As written there is plenty of sauce for the rolls but we didn t care for the strong tomato sauce flavor. Overall excellent recipe for the mixture! and we froze half of the rolls (unbaked without the sauce lay flat on sheet tray and placed in single layer in Ziploc bags lay bag flat in freezer)! When ready to bake the frozen rolls thaw rolls in fridge overnight transfer rolls to baking dish pour sauce over and bake as directed in recipe. This will be our go to recipe for stuffing the rolls!",

I utilized my Instant Pot to steam my cabbage for about 10 minutes, which was a tad too long as the outer few leaves tore apart but I still had plenty of usable leaves. If you happen to not have canned tomato sauce on hand and you\u2019re a gardener a good substitute is home canned stewed tomatoes with a couple tablespoons of tomato paste to make sauce. To cut acidity I did add a tablespoon of brown sugar to my sauce mixture. Also sprinkled in a little Italian seasonings for a little flavor boost to the sauce. These were delicious and very close to a recipe I\u2019ve used for years. The meat mixture was perfect. Although I didn\u2019t do it for this recipe, I have cheated with not rolling the meat mixture with the cabbage, but instead layering chopped cabbage in the bottom of the pan, followed by oblong \u201cmeatballs\u201d, sauce, and then more cabbage, topped with remaining sauce to make more of a casserole. Just a tip for those who may dismiss making cabbage rolls thinking it\u2019s too much work. I did use ground beef as the submitter mentions in the cooks notes. I never have ground chicken on hand. Thank you for the tasty recipe.",
