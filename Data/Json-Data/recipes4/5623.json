But if you are looking for a very nice meatloaf that everyone in the family will want seconds of, this is the one for you!  I followed the recipe with the exception of using dried parsley rather than the fresh.  I also added an extra minced garlic clove.  With this basic recipe you can do whatever you want to meet your taste requirements, but this is a very wonderful place to start.  I can tell you that this is very family friendly and will be made again in my kitchen!",

I added a tsp of Italian seasoning and ended up doubling the parsley as I didn't want leftovers, I also added another clove of garlic. I doubled the pepper because I love it. I liked the idea of half meat/half sausage, but didn't have sausage so added a pinch of fennel seeds and a dash of allspice to give it that flavor. I put the ketchup glaze on right away and cooked for 75 minutes.  It turned out great!",
