I've always known it as jambalaya, but years ago found out it wasn't the traditional jambalaya served in a spicy or zesty tomato-based dish. This is my family's twist on it. We love it very much. It's our comfort food. I've made quicker adjustments on my family's recipe for a faster prep time. And this recipe is scaled down. It's normally twice this size for our huge family.",

The only think I might do differently next time is to add the parsley at the end. It got a little dark and gummy during cooking. Otherwise very good. It may not have the spiciness or the seafood in \"real\" jambalaya but that's just fine for my midwest palate. I'm sure we'll be having this meal often. Thanks for the recipe!",
