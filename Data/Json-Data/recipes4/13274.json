It is very mild and something children would probably enjoy but to add flavor you need to make some changes. First I browned the meat with cayenne pepper crushed pepper flakes and minced garlic. I also used milk instead of water to make it more creamy and I mixed in a handful of shredded medium Cheddar. I added a few dashes of Tobasco to the soup mix and you'll likely want some salt and perhaps black pepper to taste. I top my individual serving with more shredded cheese. I also used egg noodles. Even with all those additions it still tastes pretty mild to me but it's good and simple when you don't have much energy for cooking a big meal. Consider the audience definitely; over on Campbell's website this recipe gets pretty good reviews all around.",
