Other times with cheese pico de gio and green onions. NOTE: There is an error in the recipe. It says 1/4 cup cornstarch and I believe it was meant to be a 1/4 teaspoon. Past that it is a great recipe we have and will continue to make. Thanks stopping the years of searching for our perfect cheese soup recipe!",
