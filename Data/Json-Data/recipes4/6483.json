This is really  spicy cooked cabbage and onions so don't think of it as a cold crunchy slaw.  It's not.  However, that being said,we loved it.  I would make a few modifications.  I followed recipe exactly but found with the small head of cabbage I did not need all the spices.  I used about 3/4 of mixed spices and would cut down to about half that or cut up more cabbage.  I also liked the sauted onions and since the whole thing is cooked eventually anyway, I would used a larger onion with the same small head of cabbage.  Otherwise, this was a great way to make something we don't eat alot of but like - cabbage.  It's a nice change from the regular round of cooked veggies.  I paired this with red beans and rice and center cut boneless pork chops rubbed with Creole seasoning (like Tony Chachere's)and it was like the Cajun version of a german pork and cabbage meal!",

But this was 'gritty.'\" I made the entire seasoning blend but only used half of it in the dish and even used more than the suggested 5-ish c. of chopped cabbage but this was nearly edible due to the \"grittiness\" of all of those dried spices. Thank goodness for the plain buttered egg noodles that I made to serve this over b/c they helped cut some of the spice and grit. Every bite while super-spicy was like eating on the beach w/ sand blowing in your mouth. I'm just glad that it was a cheap meal to make so I didn't mind tossing the leftovers.",
