I used orzo for the broken vermicelli and chicken broth rather than the bouillon and water. Even tho the submitter encourages using your choice of seasoning I stuck to the Greek seasoning as the recipe was written. As she said however the recipe is versatile so it allows the flexibility to use any number of different herbs or seasonings. We loved it plain and simple.",

I used the greek seasoning recipe from the AR site (it was great) and whole grain thin spaghetti for the vermicelli.  From a presentation perspective, I think I'll break the pasta into smaller pieces the next time.  Since I used 2 tsp bouillon granules, I did not add the salt, and we didn't miss it.   We like pepper, and this was just the perfect qty for us, but if you're not a pepper lover, you may want to approach that measurement cautiously.  I think this would make an excellent filling for a hollowed out whole ripe summer tomato or even adding some shredded chicken to it for a summer lunch.  Moist, flavorful, and just downright tasty.  Thanks, Ann, this is a winner in my book.",

This one intrigued me since it had the chicken bouillon, so I gave it a try. My only change was using Orzo in place of the vermicelli, and it worked out fine. I did add a bit more Greek seasoning, my own blend. Not only was the rice full of flavor it was a fluffy perfection.  I use Uncle Ben's Long grain rice and a pack of Goya chicken powder (it has a lot less sodium than other brands). This beats all other recipes I've tried. My husband said it was the best rice pilaf I've ever made. So this is now my go to rice pilaf recipe. Thanks Ann.",
