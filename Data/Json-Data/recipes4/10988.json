I cut the amount of oil in half, and added a cup of applesauce - it was the moistest cake I've ever had.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.",

We liked it so much I've made 4 in the last two weeks and none lasted more than 2 days.  I followed the recipe with two exceptions.  I used lemon pudding mix.  I made a glaze using the juice of one orange and one lemon (large) combined with 1 1/3 cup powder sugar, combined in a sauce pan, stirred over low heat until just before boiling.  After the cake has cooled 10-15 minutes I remove it from the bundt pan, pour half of the glazing into the pan, put the cake back into the pan (be careful to match up the patterns of the cake and the pan), then pour the remaining glazing on top and let it soak in.  It seems like a lot of glazing, but just be patient, it will soak in.  After the glazing has soaked in (about 5 minutes), remove the cake from the pan.  It is lip smacking good and lemony.  All my neighbors enjoy this cake.  My young children (4 and 6 yr olds) like the cake but not the glazing part, I suspect they don't like the lemony taste.",

I did soak the poppy seeds and they were less crunchy, and I did use the full amount and thought it was fine. I also used lemon pudding mix, and I definitely wouldn't use anything else---if you're making a lemon cake, make a lemon cake. I made a powdered sugar and lemon juice icing and put over it while warm and recommend this as well. Very easy and good and my husband loves it.",

The only changes that I made were to omit the poppy seeds (could not find any) and I added 1/4 cup lemon juice to the batter.  I used the glaze recommended on the reviews and its soooo good.  This is a keeper in our family.  To make the glaze I used 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and 1/4 cup-1/2 cup lemon juice.  UPDATE: 12/15/08:  I have made this recipe so many times.  It is a definite favorite in our house and I have been asked for the recipe as well.  I have since changed how I make this to make it a little less moist.  I think after making this several times 2 TBS of Lemon Juice to the batter is plenty and I use 1/4 cup Oil with no problems.  I also use Lemon Pudding Mix instead of Vanilla.  I have made the glaze using less and its still really good.  1/2 cup Powdered sugar 1/4 cup lemon juice works well together poured over the cake. I did also incorporate the Poppy Seeds this time & love that in there. Thank you so very much again!",
