I can have my 3yr old add ingredients because there is not much measuring or I can have my 13yr old just make the whole thing. These are so good they usually don t last through the night. I too love chocolate and also found it best to only use 1.5 cups of chips. Also on one occasion I didn t have any yellow mix so we used white and it was still SO good! I am actually wondering what it would be like to use carrot cake with walnuts and perhaps a dollop of cream cheese frosting?",
