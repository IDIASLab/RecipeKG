I cooked 1 cup of white long grain rice with 2 cups of chicken broth in a separate pan so I could add it to my ground beef mixture. I did not have pork sausage, but I'm sure it would be wonderful in this dish. I also added onions, celery, dried sage, 2 cloves of garlic, and rosemary to the meat for a savory taste. Once the squash was cooked, I spooned the rice and meat mixture into the wells, then topped each with some grated colby jack cheese. It turned out beautifully and was very tasty. My husband, who doesn't even like acorn squash, ate two servings! See my photo of this lovely autumn dish!",

Eliminated the oil, not necessary for the meat or squash.  Diced tomato instead of cheese.  Also, I dont have a microwave, so I baked the squash @ 375 for 40 minutes, then another 20 with the stuffing.  A great, healthy, delicous meal.",
