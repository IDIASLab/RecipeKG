Please pay particular attention to the warnings on the fiddlehead packaging from Canada Health and CFIA as to the preparation and consumption of this delicacy.

I put mine in a large bowl to soak trimmed the brown parts off and rinsed them twice and once again after boiling before adding to the saut\u00e9 pan. This ensured all the dirt and debris was removed prior to serving enjoy!",
