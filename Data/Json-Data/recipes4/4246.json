I sprinkled some crumbled bacon on top of half and kosher salt (sparingly) on the other half before the chocolate hardened added a little more crunch and garnish. Used thick cut bacon and cooked it in the oven at 300 degrees for about 25 mins. to make a soft yet crispy bacon. Also used nutella on some instead of peanut butter even more wrong. Great recipe I love bacon.",

I didn't have the time or patience for the candy thermometer so I purchased Dolci Microwave Hard Dark Choc Shell Coating. It worked great! I also crumbled the bacon. This eliminated the toothpick and made it easier for me. I spread the PB on the banana dipped it in the crumbled bacon pressed lightly and then drizzled the chocolate over the top and smoothed with a spoon around the sides. Still a little messy but quick and easy. Before the chocolate set-up I sprinkled Sea Salt Banana Chips or crumbled bacon on each. This was a fun and different recipe and we were pleasantly surprised with the sweet/smokey/salty flavor. I will make these again. Thanks for sharing!",

However I think that should be attributed to my inexperience rather than the recipe. I loved this combo though- definitely a little bizarre but sinfully yummy. One error I made was making the bacon too crispy- I disklike soggy fatty bacon but with as crisp as it was it fell apart when I tried to skewer it to the banana. Honestly in the future...only when I am home alone of course...I may just make a sort-of banana split out of it and call it good. Anyway a pleasantly surprising little snack that has all of my favorite foods in one- peanut butter chocolate and bacon. Thanks for sharing!",

Make sure your banana isn't too ripe or they fall apart. I gave up trying to spread the PB on the banana and just dabbed it on the bacon squares then added the banana. I spooned my chocolate over each let it set then turned them over and covered the bottom. I doubt I'll make these again but loved trying them. Thanks for sharing.",

I stuck it on a wodden skewer and spooned the melted chocolate over the entire piece. I sprinkled a little sea salt on top too. When I ate it I thought this would be better with a thin crisp piece of proscuitto in place of the bacon. My bacon was crisp but the texture turned me off from eating the second one I wanted some more crunch. Thanks for a fun recipe!",

Then I cut 9 banana slices and topped each one with peanut butter. I plopped them down onto the bacon and stuck a toothpick through the middle. Because I didn't want to fool with a candy thermometer I just melted some Wilton Candy Melts and spooned on the chocolate. I did top them with little colorful sprinkles. I placed them on wax paper until they were dry. I could taste each ingredient - a sweet and salty little party in my mouth.
