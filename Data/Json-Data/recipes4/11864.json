The hard pastry shell would keep the juicy contents fresh until the miners were ready to eat. My Grandma would serve with relishes and Coca Cola. If you want to make these more quickly, you can use refrigerated pie crusts instead of the pastry recipe.",

I am just writing to give a couple of suggestions.  To keep the insides moist use lard or butter.  Lard is what was traditionally used.  You could also try using a 1/2 & 1/2 combination of pork and beef, that is what my recipe calls for.  A modern twist to add some great flavor to the pasties (also a secret ingredient of a pasty shop in the U.P.) is onion soup mix.  A whole package is a little bit too much unless you are making a huge batch, so go light until you have a feel for how much you like.  Hope this helps!",

If i am short on time, i use the refrigerator pie crusts and frozen hash browns and i always add a little chopped up carrots.  My kids devour them w/ground beef so if using that, brown and drain first.  Thanks for the tip w/the water at the end, i never used that and it certainly makes them moist and w/gravy inside!  Serve w/gravy or (for the younger ones) catsup on the side!  Yum!  If you make them smaller, bite or two size, they make a great appetizer too!\r\n",
