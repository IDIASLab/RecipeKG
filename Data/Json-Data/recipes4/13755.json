I liked it with the sesame oil on top but it is good without as well. I did need to add a little salt because my broth didn't contain salt. But I wouldn't think you would need to add salt if you use storebought broth. Thanks for the great (and super healthy) recipe!",

I followed the directions as noted and made beautiful egg ribbons that were delicate and abundent. I used cornstarch instead of tapioca flour because that is what I had but I will make this again with tapioca flour to note what the difference is. I used the sesame oil and thought the amount called for was just right. Use quality chicken broth for a delicious and quick satisfying pot of wholesome healthy soup. Very nice recipe Fei Fei thanks for sharing!",
