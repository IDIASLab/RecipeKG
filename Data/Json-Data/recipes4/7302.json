The rhubarb I had was diced and frozen, and when I cooked it it turned to much so it wasn't pieces of rhubarb so much as rhubarb puree stirred into the rice but it still tasted great! I cut back a bit on the cinnamon and kicked up the spice a notch with extra cayenne. Very good recipe. I served it with some simple sauteed meat.",
