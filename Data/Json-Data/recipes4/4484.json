Per other peoples reviews I added more seasonings (dried basil oregano red pepper flakes and some locatelli cheese as I normally do to my meat sauce). I also used one can whole tomatos and two cans tomato sauce as I just like the viscosity of my sauces better this way but I feel the only flaw of the sause is its overwhelming tomato taste id maybe only use one can of paste next time. Finally I added sliced mushrooms as I'm a mushroom nut. Highly recommend this dish.",

Absolutely! (but that's not much of a surprise). It IS a great idea as a budget stretcher and a very good way to get more veggies in. It was very bland but that is easily remedied and the texture of the sauce could easily be improved as well by using less crushed tomatoes and more diced tomatoes with tomato paste. I would make this recipe again with tweaks.",
