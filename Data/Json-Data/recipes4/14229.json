However I had some difficulty with the crust. I stirred in the water and egg but the dough remained crumbly. I added a lot more water but ran out of time so I quickly threw in another egg which held it together. Because of this the crust was not light and flakey. It was rather heavy and dense. I am not an expert so I am not sure what the appropriate remedy would have been for the crust. I will def try this again with modifications to the crust.",
