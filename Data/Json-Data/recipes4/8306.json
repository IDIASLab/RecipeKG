Having my oven at such a high temperature created tons of thick eye-watering cough-inducing smoke. Second I found it way too salty. Maybe cut the salt down to half - or even lower. I'm real sensitive to salt and this I really felt was way too much. Lastly I found the chicken (especially the breasts) to be dry. Yeah the skin was great...lovely and crisp but again way too salty. I have a method of roasting a chicken done standing up in a 400 degree oven for one hour and it comes out tender juicy and best of all...NO SMOKE!!",
