It also keeps some of the texture despite blending it in a Vitamix blender. I have had mashed potatoes where the potato was boiled with the garlic that went really well. I am not sure the cauliflower was heavy enough to not leave a lingering garlic flavor. Also I have tried another similar recipe without the added dairy that tasted equally good but lighter. A bit of it got eaten with dinner but the leftovers were never touched afterwards. It started to get slightly watery and the garlic taste was just a bit to strong by that point. It worked for dinner that evening though.",
