This was very good but I did alter the recipe a little...I sauteed my mushrooms (I only used 8oz. sliced because I misread the recipe lol) in a little extra virgin olive oil with salt pepper garlic powder and parsley to soften them up a bit because I was afraid that they wouldn't cook in the time alotted. I let them cool completely and proceeded with the recipe. I also didn't have quite enough shredded mozzarella so I mixed mozzarella shredded cheddar and some shredded swiss. I sliced my bread and toasted the one side flipped them over put the mixture on and broiled them until all melted and bubbly. This went very well with our pasta dinner and I know I will be using this recipe often! I think next time I will chop the mushrooms for more even distrubtion. Thanks for sharing.:)",

I worried they would become watery and make the bread mushy during cooking, but that did not happen.  This recipe is perfect just the way it's written.  My family loved it, and so did I.",
