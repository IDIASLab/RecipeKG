I added a few extra tblsp of flour as well as 1/2 tsp salt. I floured my hands as I was rolling them which was a big help (very sticky dough otherwise). The baking time was correct and I got just over 2 doz. I did not use the listed frosting (time constraints) but frosted them with a canned butter frosting and sprinkles. I'm taking them to a church event tomorrow. A cake-like cookie that came together quickly. Thank you!",

But the cherry frosting with sprinkles really worked with these cookies. And they really do taste like the ones from the grocery store - cakey sweet so good! The batter was a weird texture - a little gummy but they came out great. I just baked a few and put the rest in the fridge. I'll probably freeze the rest of the dough to make them fresh. Thanks for a quick and tasty cookie!",
