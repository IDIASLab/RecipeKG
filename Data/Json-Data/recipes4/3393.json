I didn't measure precisely, just kind of eyeballed the ingredients trying to keep in proportion to the amount specified in the recipe. I didn't have cayenne, so substituted a couple shots of Tabasco sauce instead. Served over a bed of hot, buttered spaghettini (thin spaghetti) and \"Baked Zucchini de Provence\"(also from this site), this was a dish I'd be confident to serve to anyone. And it comes together easily with just a few fresh ingredients--cooking the pasta takes longer than it does to prepare the dish itself!",

I do a few changes though:  I use olive instead of butter, use fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream for a more slimming version, use whole wheat pasta & Parmesan cheese. turn everything off and let it sit for 5 munutes or so to let the noodles soak out the sauce.

It gets rubbery really fast. It should form a \"C\" not an \"O\" when done. If they curl up and look like \"O's\", they are overcooked. This is also cooked with lobster meat or crab. Living on Puget Sound as I do, I use the Dungeness Crab. (Fresh, not canned.) I've made this recipe for about forty years. Delish!",
