So as many others have done I put my own spin on this. I had milk I didn't want to waste so I used that instead of water. I upped the salt to 1 teaspoon substituted butter for the oil used equal amounts of whole wheat and bread flour and added 1 T. of vital gluten for good measure! Many reviewers increased the honey to 1/4 cup but I found the 3 tablespoons to be perfect. For those who choose to stick to the recipe as written I suggest you at least increase the salt to 1 teaspoon. This is just a great loaf of bread - moist and tender crumb beautiful color and simply delicious.",
