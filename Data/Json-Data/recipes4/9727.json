I loved to use my pressure cooker, so I cooked the beans for 8 minutes, and let sit for 20 minutes and then drained them. I used 4 cans of chicken broth and I cup of water. I used all the ingredients as listed and followed the directions, except for substituting the chicken brother for the 9 cups of water. I cooked the soup at high pressure for 20 minutes. It was quick and delicious. This recipe is a keeper.",

Also, I didn't have ground cloves so I tied 4 whole ones into a piece of cheese cloth and that seemed just right flavor wise. Voted the new favorite by the kiddo.",

Also, if you want to make your beans turn out very tender, don't add anything salty or oily until the beans are almost finished cooking. One more thing... I have eaten beans of one type or another almost everyday of my life and I have NEVER discarded the water I soak my beans in because you lose SO much flavor. Rinse the beans in a colander and use the soaking water. Trust me - it makes a huge difference.",
