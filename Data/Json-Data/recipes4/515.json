I had the pasta and a package of cheese, I was going to just boil the pasta, drain, and add the cheese, but I'm pretty sure the results would've been clumpy and undesirable. So when I stumbled upon this recipe, I was psyched to see that I already had all the ingredients, and that it was easy and quick to prepare. I just threw it together, hit the books (actually the video games, but \"the books\" sounds more responsible) and an hour later had a good meal whose leftovers lasted me a few days. And to add some more nutrition, I had it w/ a little frozen broccoli and cheese on the side (Mom should be proud). Overall, this is a simple and tasty dish that most people probably already the the ingredients for.",

Before serving I stirred it to mix up the cheese and milk on the bottom of the pan added more cheese to the top and re-covered to let the cheese melt on the way to grandma's house!",
