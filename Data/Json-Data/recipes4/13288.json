I used two bunches of asparagus, about 3/4 pint of tomatoes, oil and 1/3 cup cheese. No salt or pepper. VERY good - will make again!!! Just 5 people almost ate it all up!! Tip: When steaming the asparagus, steam slightly underdone as it will keep cooking during the few minutes that the cheese melts. Also, drain off the water real well so you don't get watery cheese.",

Instead of just olive oil, I used a garlic balsamic vinaigrette that I had already made (EV olive oil, garlic, dijon mustard, balsamic vinegar, sugar, salt, black pepper).  I let the asparagus simmer for a couple minutes in the vinaigrette with the added tomatoes then grated fresh parmesan over the top before serving.  We loved this!  It was such a fresh & delicious side dish!  Thanks for the great idea!  :)",

I used 1/2 bunch of asparagus, cut into 2-3\" pieces, tossed in just a little olive oil, adding salt and pepper.  I increased the tomatoes using 10 grape tomatoes for basically 1/2 the recipe and also tossed them in olive oil adding salt and pepper.  I roasted the asparagus at 400 degrees for about 6 minutes and then added the tomatoes and parmesan for another 2 minutes.  My asparagus were pencil thin and came out perfectly and the tomatoes weren't mushie and had just begun to collapse a little.  I would do it this way again.  Same concept, but different method.  Pretty, too!",
