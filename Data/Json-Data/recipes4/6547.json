I also cut back the mozzarella by about half. I couldnt find my Italian seasoning and just sprinkled a little Goya adobo seasoning on the filling for flavor with some additional black pepper. I do not care for jarred sauce so I just put some unsalted canned tomatoes in my blender with a pinch of garlic sauce and used that. Only other change was using just 1 egg. I only baked it about 20 25 minutes added a little cheese then 5 or so minutes more.",

I also added some fresh mozz to the mix because I had some in need of use. I forewent broiling and simply removed the foil and added the mozz for the final 10 minutes of baking. My box of manicotti held 14 and this filled all w/1/2C or so leftover. I'd have rated these a 3 myself but Mr. LTH really enjoyed them hence the \"4\". If I make this again I'll def up the filling seasonings. THANKS for the recipe.",

I used a mix of Mario Batali's alfredo sauce (15 oz) and Paul Newman's alfredo sauce (15 oz). I didn't have the amount needed written on my shopping list. The extra sauce didn't hurt a thing and the recipe was lovely even having it twice. I definitely will add this to the family favorite meal list.",
