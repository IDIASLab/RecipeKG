It uses garam masala, a blend of dry roasted, ground spices from the colder climes of northern India. 'Garam' is the Indian word for 'warm' or 'hot'; garam masala adds a sense of 'warmth' to both palate and spirit, and can be purchased in Indian markets and in the gourmet section of some supermarkets.",

I laid the strips over the sliced onion and only sprinkled a little bit of salt on them not the full 1/2 tsp. They needed 45 minutes to cook and then I drained what liquid was left and added the sauce. The sauce I doubled from the way it is listed (so doubled twice from scaling down the chicken amount) I didn't have tomato paste so I used ketchup and omited the extra salt. I also used dehydrated celery flakes instead of celery salt. I added around 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. Since the sauce wasn't that thick I added around 3/4 tsp of cornstarch as I mixed it all together in a bowl then poured over the chicken. The end result was good but I wanted more tomato flavor so next time I will use the paste but I will increase the amount. We served it over brown rice.",
