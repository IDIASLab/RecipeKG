I needed someting easy to prepare as I was running short on time (and energy). Served alongside salsa rice (by Molly Ingle) with beer margaritas (by Big Surprise) to wash it all down these were very tasty! I made a double batch (big eaters here...) so I had to microwave my meat for close to 11.5 minutes total. Served with hard taco shells shredded taco seasoned cheese tomatoes lettuce green onion taco sauce and sour cream. It's amazing how good 'ol \"comfort\" food tastes. These remind me exactly of my mother's tacos. A great childhood memory. Thanks for sharing. I'll never use taco seasoning again:)",
