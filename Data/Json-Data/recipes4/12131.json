Thanks for sharing this easy no roll recipe! UPDATE: In case you're new at this I wanted to remind people that these treats will get moldy since they have no preservatives. Keep a close eye out so your pooch doesn't get sick! My frozen treats have thawed out quite nicely.",

I also added 1/2t garlic powder. I'm not sure if I'll put in the whole tablespoon of salt next time...not sure why it needed so much. I would never use that much in a recipe for people.
