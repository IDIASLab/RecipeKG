I sauteed the onions and garlic, and put them on top. I replaced bouillon cubes with 2tsp Better Than Bouillon soup base and omitted the salt.  I used a few teaspoons of dried basil.  The roast cooked completely submerged in liquid on low for 8-9 hours, completely fell apart.  The gravy was fabulous.  I couldn't taste the coffee directly, but there was a depth of flavor that was tasty.  Something that tells you, \"Secret Ingredient\", but you'd never guess coffee.  I served it all with mashed potatoes and peas.  I will be making it again and am curious to try it with a venison roast.",

I used a top round roast & dried basil. After browning the meat & sauteing the onions & garlic, I deglazed the pan with the coffee & transferred everything to a crockpot. I let it cook on low while I was at work. When I got home, I just removed the roast to another dish, then poured the jus into a pot on the stove, stirred in the flour/water mix & let it thicken. The gravy was truly To Die For! I've found my new definite Go-To recipe! Oh, and I did use dried basil as well.",

Then you add garlic & onions to that yummy brown stuff & cook  until THEY start to stick to the pan. Then you pour your liquid (stock, water, wine, whatever) into the pan & scrape up all the yummy brown bits.\nThen you cook it for 3 hrs, & thicken the gravy w/ the flour-water mixture at the end.\nCooking (at least western European cooking) is all about the yummy stuff you can make stick to the bottom of the pan then turn into a sauce.",
