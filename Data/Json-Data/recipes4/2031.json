It became soggy but the flavor really soaked in the asparagus. Luckily my boyfriend prefers the asparagus soggy. If you prefer a crunchier side of the asparagus I would cook it a few minutes less. The second time I cooked it I tried to sautee it on the stove. It was crunchier but the red-wine vinegar didn't really soak it on. I added a few more drizzle when I turned off the fire. It was delicious! Highly recommend this recipe if you like easy and big on flavor asparagus!",
