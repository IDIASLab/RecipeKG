If I'm making four or more pies at a time, I use my food processor.  My lard is always kept in the fridge, and before I begin, I place a glass of water in the freezer.  (Cold ingredients ensure a more workable dough.)  I briefly pulse the flour, lard, and salt to form pea-sized balls.  I add between 4 and 6 T. of ice water, depending on humidity, until a ball forms.  (A slightly sticky dough is easier to work with than one that's too dry.)  Work quickly!  Do not overwork the dough or allow the ingredients to warm to room temp!  I bake the bottom crust for a few minutes before adding the filling.  I've been told on many occasions, \"This is the best pie I've ever had in my life!\" \n****I often skip refrigerating the dough if I'm making one or two pies and have no problems.",

It would be premixed and stored in the cupboard. When she needed a pie crust, she would measure out 2 cups for a two-crust pie and add enough water to bring the dough together - somewhere between 3 and 5 tbsp for 2 cups mix. No refrigeration Always ready Always delicious. Always flaky. I'm going to keep my extra in the fridge this time as I don't make pies as often. Waiting for my apple pie now.",
