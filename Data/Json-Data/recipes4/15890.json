Only changed two tiny things, but did rest the same.\" I didn't have quite 2 cups of broccoli, so I used asparagus to make up the difference. Didn't put the single wedged roma tomato in at the end b/c I thought it would just get lost in the all the other stuff (plus, I don't think tomatoes really jive w/ stir-fry flavors.) I'm not a fan of ramen on its own (well, since college days that is) simply b/c the flavor packet is just soooo SO strong, but it mellowed out when mixed w/ all these great veggies and chicken! And wow, it all came together wonderfully -- we absolutely loved this dinner! Next time I'm going to add some red bell pepper for a little more color, or try swapping chicken for shrimp or maybe try to a different flavor of ramen - seems like it'd be a fun recipe to tool around w/!",

I even reserved some of the boiled ramen water just in case the dish got dry only because I've had issues with dry ramen dishes before. Good thing since I ended up needing it. BTW regarding the sauce I went ahead and mixed all the sauce ingredients ahead of time (including the boiled ramen water) then poured it over everything at the end to be sure it was flavored evenly. Also went vegetarian so no chicken used green onions instead of regular onion and added bok choy and celery. Delicious very flavorful! A definite keeper when we're craving ramen! Thank you!",

The vegetables listed sound delicious but I had to switch things up to use the vegetables I had in the house (broccoli, onion, mushrooms, celery, carrots, snow peas, and cherry tomatoes). Also, instead of chicken I sauteed some marinated tofu and added it at the end with the tomatoes. Delicious and oh so easy.   It definitely helped the flavor that I had marinated the tofu ahead of time.  It makes two very generous servings or three normal ones.  UPDATE:  I tried it again with chicken \u2014 it\u2019s better with tofu. Also, it could have used some cornstarch the second time I made it (I slightly increased the sauce).",
