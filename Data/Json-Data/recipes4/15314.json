It was incredibly lacking in taste and sweetness. I added stevia to my bowl and that helped. I think the ratio of quinoa and chia to flavorings is off. I'd use either a far less amount of the seeds or a much much greater amount of berries honey and whatever to give this a little more punch. As for my house smelling like heaven well I couldn't smell anything until I got near the crockpot and it smelled very earthy - not like warm vanilla and berrie porridge. Again a ratio thing probably. has potential but certainly not as as posted here.",

Very simple ingredients easy to prepare and very healthy plus I can make a batch on Sunday and have enough for quick healthy breakfasts throughout the week. I did make a couple of changes. I used unsweetened almond vanilla milk instead of soy. I used 3 1/2 cups of water & added 1/4 cup of Sugar Free Zero Calorie Walden Farms Blueberry Syrup. Also added 1/2 TSP of salt. Can't wait to experiment with other seasonal fruits. For those who are not used to it quinoa definitely has a unique taste it can take some getting used to. Also quinoa is just like rice - you need to RINSE it beforehand. Otherwise you get an earthy somewhat bitter taste when cooked. So just put it in a strainer & rinse it under some cold water before cooking.",
