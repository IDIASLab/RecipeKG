We made a few variations: we substituted spicy chicken sausage for pork sausage fiery roasted tomatoes for plain tomatoes doubled the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (which I thought would be hard to find but were at a regular grocery store!) left out the coriander because my boyfriend hates cilantro. It was spicy smokey and wonderful - huge hit and we will make again!",

I went heavier on the chipotles sauteed bell pepper w/ the onion and garlic and used 2 cans of beans. (What I had on hand Great Northern and Black.) While the end result was a touch too thick for my taste-texture (would be perfect over a baked potato or fries though!) I wouldn't change a thing. Really the chipotles MAKE this chili outstanding and a 5-star keeper in my book! Oh and we ate our's w/ tortilla chips green onion and grated cheddar. Already salivating thinking of the leftovers tomorrow... or tonight if I get a chilitch. e.g. chili itch. Thanks Emily for introducing me to the wonderfulness of using chipotles canned in adobo as a knockout addition to chili!",

I made the following variations.. Meat: 1.5lbs 90% lean beef and 1lb ground turkey (we were looking for healthy chile). Dropped the chipotle peppers and only had about 4 tablespoons of chile powder in the pantry so that's all it got. My wife and I are hot food whimps so that was enough for both of us. I also used pre-minced garlic (in oil) since I didn't feel like buying a whole head for 2 cloves. I also only used half an onion because a \"large onion\" here is HUGE so 1/2 of one was a good cup of onions. I did use the red kidney beans as well. The final product was AWESOME the combination didn't need any additional water or anything like others have done but I did use less meat. I realize I took the chipotle out of the Chipotle Chili but like I said I was really just looking for a good base crock-pot recipe for chile and this more than qualified.",
