I sided it with sliced avocado stuffed crabs and wheat crackers. I was not able to find seedless cucumbers at my market so I used a regular cucumber halved it sliced it lengthwise then scooped out the seeds with a melon baller. Changes I made: - Put half of everything in the blender to smooth it out then added the other half of the tomatoes for a few seconds just to chop them down a bit. - Used lime juice instead of sherry vinegar. - Added about 1/2-1 cup V8 juice and 1/2 tsp. each of cumin curry and cayenne pepper to give it a slight kick. - Used 2 serano peppers instead of 1 jalepeno (it's what I had on-hand) and used cilantro.

I've used another recipe from this site that was better and the main taste difference is the use of fresh versus canned tomatoes. That said I specifically went looking for a recipe using canned b/c of the convenience. Considering this this is a very good one. Taste is only marginally compromised by not using fresh tomatoes and that's worth it when in a pinch. I'll make this again I'm sure.",
