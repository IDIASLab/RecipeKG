The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.\n\nThe second time I made it, I didn't have any milk, so I substituted with unsweetened almond milk. The sauce turned out just as well as with dairy milk. My fianc\u00e9 could not tell the difference. I boiled the rutabaga and placed in buttered dish as instructed, and added chopped frozen green and yellow beans, carrots, broccoli, and thawed chopped spinach, tossed to mix well. Sprinkled the veggies with red pepper flakes, and then poured the sauce over. Topped with seasoned bread crumbs and added some parmesan. Baked for about thirty minutes. My fianc\u00e9 loved it, and said he preferred the added veggie version.\n\nThank you for this recipe :)",
