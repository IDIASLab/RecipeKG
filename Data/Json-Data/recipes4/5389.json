It also worked out b/c I had some strawberries that were a little past their prime, so what better to do w/ them than make this... LOVED the fresh flavor, and so simple to make too!

Well, RNG... we love it too. This batch was made for my wonderful neighbor who faithfully mows my yard(and is a Beaver fan). He was delighted and ordered more for the Civil War game yet to come. It did take twice as many oranges, cut up; about 2 cups and a little longer to cook down. But, it was so worth it. I also added orange zest.",
