This is a recipe I developed myself over time, it reminds me of eating supper on Sunday night with my family. This is an adaptation of Irish stew made with lamb. In Ireland lamb was cheap, and in Canada beef is much cheaper than lamb. I'm aware of a French Canadian version that uses pork. Serve with bread.",
