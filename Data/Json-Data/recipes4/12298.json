The only 'head's up' I would give to others trying this recipe, is to wait at least 15 minutes before you slice the pizza.  The sauce is very runny, so you have to give it a few minutes to solidify.  Next time I make it, I'm adding fresh spinach to the mix!  Thanks for sharing this recipe Emking!  :)",

For ease I did the dough for the crust in my bread machine, and my dough was a little liquidy so instead of adding more flour I added parmesan cheese.  For the alfredo sauce (because it is so rich) I covered the pizza with a little sauce and then put the rest out for dipping.  I put spinich, green onion and chicken on for toppings. Thanks Emking for a great recipe.",
