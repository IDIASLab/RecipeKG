The recipe that I submitted says to use PARSLEY, with a small note at the bottom that cilantro may be substituted. I guess Allrecipes figures Latin food must use cilantro. Parsley has much better flavor, and many people don't like cilantro. Parsley is used much more in Brazil than cilantro.\n\nGreat to see that everyone is altering the recipe to suit their own taste. I love how you can use whatever you want in this recipe; as long as you know the technique, you're all set to experiment. \n\nIf you liked this recipe, try the same method with chicken as well. Thanks again!",

Also needed 50 minutes to cook dry even though I was very careful not to overdo the water.  Thanks for sharing this.  Can't wait to do this again.",

We love barbecuing ribs in the summer and this recipe is a close second and an easy way to cook ribs during the off-season. I changed the recipe in that I did not use cilantro. Also I didn't bother cooking the water away...just boiled the ribs for 25 mins. in all those great ingredients tgeb brushed them with our favorite bottled bbq sauce (Diane's) and then baked them for 10-15 minutes in a 325 degree oven turning them and brushing them with more sauce half-way through. Fantastic!",

Having never boiled ribs I found out what others did, that a big pile of ribs (I at least doubled the qty) in a big pot will take hours to boil the water away.  Seemed like overcooking so I had to pour off and the first time the ribs were not browned.  2nd time I poured off through a strainer to keep the good bits and browned the ribs.  Way good!  Yes they seemed salty the first time.  Just adjust to taste.  The real kicker to this recipe is the cilantro and lime.  Use generously  during and after cooking and the dish's flavor really pops out.  Will be keeping this one around.  Thx",

I used lite soy sauce and reduced the amount as suggested and mine are perfectly seasoned, the cilantro makes it I think..  However, it did take almost 2 hours for all the water to evaporate.\nEdited:\nUse the largest (widest) pan you can find to facilitate the evaporation and cook at just a simmering boil.  You want the longer cooking time to make them tender.  And just as others said, watch it closely when it gets 1/2 because it finishes fast.",

The slightly garlicy coating is awesome.  I almost quit cooking it too soon, as just before it browns it makes a great sauce.  I turned it off and tasted some, but turned it back on, and was glad I took it to the final browning stage.  Do try this, you won't be disappointed.  Thanks so much for sharing this!",

I lessened the soy and the water, as other's suggested  but otherwised followed the recipe to a T.  One note though, when it says brown bits it really means brown bottom.  All of a sudden (after 50 minutes or so) there was no water and the bottom of the pan was covered with all the seasonings and I almost burned it.  Very delicious, concentrated brown sauce though.  Just be careful or it could ruin the pan and the ribs.",
