We sprayed the pan with cooking spray and then used canola oil instead of butter - healthier fats. Since we used 4 drumsticks we put in 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth. We cooked it in an electric fry pan at 375 F and it worked beautifully. It was done (170 F) in about 1 to 1-1/4 hours. During the last 15 minutes I added one can of light mushroom soup and it just made the broth a little creamier and a fantastic gravy. This is will be our go to recipe from now on.",
