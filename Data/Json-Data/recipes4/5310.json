Fortunately, it is excellent reheated (and better the next day, too!) My mother always made this with leftover holiday ham, which makes it even more economical. Can be baked in the oven (very slow!) or cooked on the stovetop (my preferred choice).",

I varied the recipe slightly - used left over roast ham added freshly ground salt & black pepper between layers and added a glug of double cream to the milk and finished by topping with red cheddar and Parmesan cheese! Cooked in a lidded casserole dish in oven 180 c 1hr 30 and removed lid to brown top 10mins. Husband and children Loved this - thankyou for this recipe!",
