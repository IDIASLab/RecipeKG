They are very tasty as is but sometimes I'll add a little finely chopped or grated onion for a little extra something. I love topping these with sauteed mushrooms and onions and usually just use whatever cheese I have on hand (swiss is great). I've never had a problem with them falling apart or anything but I also do not measure the breadcrumbs just eyeball it and mix with my hands to get the right consistancy. All in all a very nice simple and tasty burger! Thanks for sharing.:)",
