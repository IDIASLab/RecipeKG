I must admit that I don't follow any specific ingredient amounts when I make this -- I just put however much I think looks right. Here's how I make it: 1) Preheat oven's broiler. 2) Slather one side of a slice of bread with peanut butter. 3) Generously sprinkle milk chocolate chips or chopped up milk chocolate candy (for when I don't have chips) on the peanut butter layer. 4) Place marshmallows on chocolate layer. 5) Spread a small amount of peanut butter on one side of another slice of bread. Place bread peanut butter side down on other slice of bread. 6) If not already on a baking sheet place the sandwich on one and broil it for a minute or two. 7) Take baking sheet out flip the sandwich over (you may have to be careful when doing this) and broil again for another minute or two.",

For the sliced bread we only had whole grain and that didn't sound like a good match so we used 2 hotdog buns. Buttered the outsides and spread the peanut butter on both sides. This causes everything to stick well. Instead of mini marshmallows I used 4 of the large marshmallows and cut them in half. They fit perfectly in the buns. We cooked them in a saute pan until both sides were browned and crispy. The salty butter crispy outside of the bread paired with the sweet melted layers of this sandwich made us really glad we waited until after the kids went to bed to make them. So simple yet so great!",
