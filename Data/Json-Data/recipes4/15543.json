And I will tell you why.  \nYou first boil a whole cut up chicken with BONES IN and SKIN ON!  this is the flavor of the whole soup. Don't use chicken bullion because you are just putting artificial flavoring in and too much preservatives.  After your chicken is boiled, remove chicken from pot. Skim off fat.  Cook all your fresh vegetables in chicken stock you just made.  After veggies are tender, remove skin and bones from chicken (if desired) and cut chicken in small bite sizes to desired sizes and return chicken to pot with veggies.  Cook as long as you like on stove.  When cooking is done, boil egg noodles in separate pan with water.  Only add noodles to bowl of soup when you want to eat.  Keep cooked noodles separate in container and add as you eat soup.  Keeps noodles from sogginess.  Grandma' secret.  There it is!!  Wonderful yummy!!",

It is exactly what it is supposed to be and that is a basic recipe for chicken and noodle soup, and you can adjust the measurement of the ingredients to suit your tastes.  The only change I made was to cut back on the water, I thought that was too much water, I like a chunkier soup, but that is a personal preference.\n\nAs for the person who said this gave her a stomach ache?? There is nothing in this recipe that would cause someone to get sick unless they have an allergy to one of the ingredients or perhaps she used spoiled chicken?  I don't know, but to blame the recipe on her stomach bug is beyond ridiculous.",

I can't put my finger on it, but this just didn't taste right and left me and my hubs with a terrible belly ache (which wasn't a good thing for me since I am already battling the stomach flu). It was probably the flu (and my hubs coming down with the flu) that caused our discomfort, but it was sure a coincidence.... That aside, while my hubs and I didn't think this was terrible, we both agreed that we've had better. Maybe this will float your boat, but it didn't do much for us. Thanks anyways, BakerBee. :-)",

Although they tasted fine I think that's why the soup is darker in color than a traditional chicken soup (impact on appearance only). I used peas only rather than peas & carrots since this recipe already has chopped carrots. From an eye appeal perspective IMO sliced carrots would look better in this soup. I did cut back on the water omitted the salt because of the bouillon cubes and after tasting when cooking was complete added some parsley flakes and a little bit of marjoram. Pretty nice chicken noodle soup.",

I thought the recipe would make enough to freeze quite a bit for an easy meal later (not that this is hard) but the crew left very little over and everyone commented several times on how yummy it was. I didn't think it was too watery or anything like that I liked the consistency and this will now be my go-to recipe for my favorite comfort food!",

In fact I ended up adding more water before reheating the soup for supper. While the stock was heating up I cut up raw chicken breasts added frozen peas along with the carrots celery and onion. I then added black pepper basil and oregano. Since bouillon was already added I saw no reason the add more salt. I cooked the soup for 20 minutes then added the egg noodles and cooked another 15 min. I made the soup in the morning and just needed to reheat later on for supper. We had corn muffins and a salad with it. It was the perfect meal for a rainy day. My husband had two bowls and there is plenty for tomorrow night too. This will be a go to chicken soup recipe.",
