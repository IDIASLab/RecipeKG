I added more plum tomatoes than indicated in the recipe used light cream and added chopped zucchini at the very end to add a little crunch to the soup. The pepper flakes were more aggressive than we would have liked even though I used less than was indicated so adjust to your own tastes. This was very enjoyable and an excellent use of veggies from the garden.",
