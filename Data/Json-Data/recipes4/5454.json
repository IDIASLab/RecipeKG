Keep in mind that most of the flavor in this dish comes from the pasta sauce as the only seasonings added are garlic and red pepper flakes so definitely use a quality flavorful sauce. Also the time listed in the recipe to cook the veggies is really not enough to combine flavors and cook down the veggies enough to work with the pasta. Reheating the leftovers and adding salt pepper oregano rosemary basil and fresh parsley and cooking it down a little really helped.",

I added salt, black pepper, and Cajun seasoning to the chicken before cooking it, and added some cayenne to my pasta sauce for an extra kick. Otherwise, I liked that minimal spices let the flavor of the chicken and vegetables really stand out. I'll make it again, for sure. Thanks for a great recipe!",

Used chicken fillets that I had in the fridge. Also didn't have red pepper flakes so I substituted with 1/2 ts cayenne pepper and 1 ts chilli flakes. Doubled the broccoli for more fibre.\n\nMaybe I'll publish this as a new recipe once I tried it.",
