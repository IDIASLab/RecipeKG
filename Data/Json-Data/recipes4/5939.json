I didn't have any apples on hand and I hate onions so I left them out. Used apple juice instead of cider. I really liked how the dish turned out. Chicken was really tender. Juice and cranberries added just enough sweetness. Bacon did better crisping up under the broiler so I did broil it for about 3 minutes. Next time I might try using fresh or frozen cranberries and see if there is a major difference. I must say that you must like mustard for this dish. If you have a child or guest who doesn't like mustard then they probably wouldn't like it. I'm thinking about trying this recipe with pork chops or pork tenderloin.",

I used twice the apple sauce (1 cup total) but mixed in a little cinnamon instead of mustard. After adding the cranberries I poured the remaining apple juice over the bake but prior to pouring stirred about 2 Tbsp of balsamic vinegar into the juice. I omitted the bacon. Instead I baked the dish for 40 min removed the foil baked for 10 min uncovered then added 8 oz of brie cheese for the remaining 10 min uncovered. Yum!",

That made it amazing--my kids and I ate it right up. I also used boneless skinless thighs with the one chicken breast I had defrosted and they cooked down to falling apart. Being out of applesauce I just put some fresh apples in my Ninja and blended them up with the vinegar and I think it was more than the half cup of applesauce but it ended up being amazing. One other change I recommend: skip the bacon. You really don't need it and it just doesn't add enough flavor to justify the cost.",
