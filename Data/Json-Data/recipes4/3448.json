So I added some chopped green bell peppers and some chopped onion to give it more of a crunch. That really added a LOT more flavor and it was perfect! Next time I will definitely reduce the mayo and sour cream to suit my family's preference. It tastes great after chilling in the fridge overnight and is awesome served with crackers.",

I dislike most chicken salads because they call for ingredients that I don't like (celery raw onions etc.) but this one fit the bill for my picky preferences. I changed the mayo/sour cream ratio to 1/2 cup each because I love sour cream and I used minced shallots instead of green onions for their milder onion flavor and since I didn't have garlic salt I used garlic paste (about two tablespoons for the whole recipe) and added regular table salt and pepper to taste. I also served it on wheat with thinly sliced cucumber and shredded lettuce... it provided a crunchy cool contrast to the spicy creamy chicken that complimented it perfectly. I shared it with my mom and her coworker who both loved it. I had to print out copies of the recipe for them! This would be great for a picnic or potluck lunch. I'll be making it again for sure!",

We like it spicy and that amount was just right for us. I didn't have green onion on hand so I used some regular white onion and it added a wonderful crunch! I eyeballed the mayo adding just enough to make the salad moist. I despise typical chicken salads but this new spin on chicken salad is amazing! I added about 1-2 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro and 1/4-1/2 tsp of lime juice. Perfect! Thanks for the yummy recipe!",
