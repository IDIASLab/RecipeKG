Sure, the mixture in this recipe would be well-suited as a spread for crackers but its appeal for me was that it wasn\u2019t a spread for crackers.  This was packed with flavor and the crackers hardly missed.  The fresh garlic, I believe, is critical, although I\u2019d consider cutting back on it a bit.  I made one package of cream cheese as the recipe directed.  I experimented with the other, using black olives rather than the green, and added finely chopped, multi-colored bell peppers and just a pinch of seasoning salt.  Both variations were very good, and both were attractive with their specks of color.  I took the cue from Shorecook and piped the mixture into the celery with a large open star tip. This is a very versatile recipe, with endless possibilities for different seasonings or add-ins.",

I used the change servings option and made only 4 servings so it wasn't a huge waste. I just have a small container of the cream cheese mixture leftover. I thought the mixture looked festive with the red and green pieces. I didn't expect that from the main picture. I would consider this more of a holiday appetizer. However I ended up using a block of lite cream cheese and didn't care for it before even adding the other ingredients. So that may have not helped. I normally buy regular cream cheese or regular whipped style. The lite had a really off taste. The other 2 that tried the recipe couldn't get past the olive taste which didn't seem to bother me at all. I can see olive and garlic lovers possibly really liking the combination though. Just didn't work for us as a snack idea I guess.",
