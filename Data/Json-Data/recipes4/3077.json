Instead I bake it in a non-stick pan at 400 degrees for 45 minutes or longer. Also I had to experiment with a few cheeses to get the right texture - less grease. What works well for me is sharp cheddar. If you still use butter try something like I can't believe it's not butter. Less fat still enjoyable!",
