In Ireland we never would blend any part of traditional vegetable soup, we cut the veg up to desired size before adding. Also this soup starts with first making home made stock using either a beef bone or chicken carcass. Then all the vegetables are added and left to simmer and near end you add seasoning. Potato is not used as a vegetable in soup. It is served with a whole boiled potato placed in bowl.",

I had never used parsnips, turnips, or leeks before but I would use them all again after this.  I would  not, however, put all of a stew in the blender again.  I wish I had only blended half of the stew  so that there would still be some texture to it.  It came out more like a root vegetable mash than a stew or soup.  I cook the vegetables in chicken broth instead of water and didn't drain off anything.  I still needed to use several cups of water to to turn this into anything resembling \"soup\".    I made this for St. Paddy's day dinner but no one ate much of it.  It looked unappealing and probably should have less carrots or carrots cooked separately so that the color looks less like orange-y mud.  Be sure to watch the veggies closely as they cook so that they don't brown.  It was tasty though and shows some real potential for alteration.",

I substitued range free chicken broth for the water but that wasnt enough and I ended up having to add a bunch of seasonings in order to give this soup some flavor. It seems like it's got potential but it would be nice to have some additional instructions as far as seasoning. I compared to a few other recipes on the internet and ended up adding chicken boullion cumin thyme and sage. It helped alot.",
