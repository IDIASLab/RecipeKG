Cut the chicken into cubes and marinated it for about 30 minutes then placed all ingredients into a casserole dish and baked it for about 35 minutes at 350 and served over hot rice.  Next time I think I will add garlic powder and a few red pepper flakes for a little added zip.  I also may try doing it as a stir fry so I can thicken the sauce a little bit.  Regardless it was very good and super easy!",

I baked them in the foil packets for about 45 minutes total at 450 degrees (checked at 20 and they weren't ready). I used fresh pineapple and that was very good with it the best part of the dish I thought. The chicken didn't absorb too much of the flavor I marinated it for about an hour prior to cooking as well so once on the plate I added a little drizzle of the teriyaki sauce over the meat and rice. It was overall a good dish I loved the veggies in it! Easy to prep simple and tasty.",

Cut everything up (except the chicken) and added it all to a bag.  Drenched everything in KC Masterpiece Honey Teriyaki and let marinate for 1 hour. Put everything in each packet, added the pineapple on top and sealed them up.  Cooked on the grill for about 45 min and served over white rice. It was a flavor explosion! I think the honey teriayki was the key. Will definately make again!!",
