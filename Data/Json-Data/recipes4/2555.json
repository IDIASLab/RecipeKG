They're quick and easy, have lots of fiber, and they're unbelievably moist!  (If yours are dry, just underbake them slightly.)  Here are a couple of tips:  Skip the spices and just use spice flavor cake mix.  Same flavor, but quicker!  Also, try making these with dark chocolate cake mix.  You absolutely cannot taste the pumpkin!  They taste a lot like brownies!",

I added 2 eggs and about 1/3c vegetable oil to make the batter better, and about 3/4c chopped walnuts for fun.  I also would have liked about twice as much of the seasonings for more flavor.  Overall ok, nice and moist but not a strong pumpkin flavor.  Finally, these were enormous muffins, but still cooked completely for the recommended 25 minutes.",

My husband who doesn't even like pumpkin liked these! I plan on experimenting with different cake mixes adding white chocolate chips or maybe spreading with cream cheese. My daugher wanted them with ice cream!:)They are good hot or cold. These would be good to send in lunchboxes or take to brunch or as a gift to someone sick.",
