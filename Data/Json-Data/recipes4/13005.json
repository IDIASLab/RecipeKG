The servings were generous and it fed two huge teenage boys and my husband and myself - served with mashed potatoes and beans over which the gravy went. It is very filling and satisfying. I cooked it in the crockpot instead of the dutch oven and it took longer of course but the recipe was easy to adapt. Thank you for a really hearty yummy winter warmer this is so easy and definitely worth keeping!",

I skipped a can of Heinz baked baked beans instead of the kidney beans and did not need to use the cornstarch as the gravy was just perfect. I cooked it in the slow cooker for about 5.5 hours on high heat. Next time I think I will cook it for just 4 hours as some of the smaller pieces fell off the bone. The bigger pieces were fine though....Thanks for sharing....I served this with ugali/sadza/nishima (depending on which part of Africa you are familiar with) and braised cabbage for a truly authentic African meal.

Then I added carrots and celery (cause I love veggies) cooked them for a minute or two and then threw in 3 tsp garlic ( it mellows in cooking and I love the flavor). I left out the beans and cornstarch and extra water because with the added veggies it didn't need thickening. I cooked the whole thing for 2.5 hrs and then served it over rice. My boyfriend who had initially said \"ew tails\" said this one is a keeper. I forgot how flavorful beef tails are. One would think 5 bucks a pound is a lot for them but they are packed with flavor.",
