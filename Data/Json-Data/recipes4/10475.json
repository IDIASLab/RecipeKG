I cut the tofu into small chunks for easier browning. I also used canola oil instead of butter to lower the fat. I took the tofu out after it browned to drain and made the sauce in the same pan. I did thicken the sauce with a cornstarch and water mixture because mine seemed to thin. I added the tofu back in at the end to heat through. I served mine over brown rice with chopped green onions on the top for garnish. Was very tasty. Thank you.",
