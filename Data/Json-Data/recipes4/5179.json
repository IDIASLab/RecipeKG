I don't go to a party where I don't get asked for the recipe!  Just put more chili powder in if you want them spicier, or more brown sugar if you like them sweet!

I used jalape\u00f1os and mini red yellow and orange peppers for the people who couldn't take the heat from the jalape\u00f1os. Both types were very well received. I made as written and used turkey bacon to help cut calories. This will be made often this summer as grilling season starts. Thanks Bennyh614 for sharing your recipe.",
