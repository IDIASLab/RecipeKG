I also added ketchup to the beans just because that is what my mother in law always does. The beans did take longer than two hours to cook though. I will next time follow the suggestion of another reviewer and soak the beans over night. Thanks for such a great recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "I am making a huge pot of beans for a family bbq today as I type this review out. Two things this recipe fails to mention is...1 - make sure your beans are not outdated (yes beans do go stale). And 2 - beans need to be soaked (overnight preferably and depending on the bean) in order to rehydrate them. With both of those said the older the bean the longer it takes to cook that is if it will cook up at all (regardless of soaking). And with soaking not only does the bean rehydrate (resulting in a shorter cooking time..the 2hours as the recipe suggests for 1 lb of beans) but you also properly clean the beans of any debris and remove the indigestible complex sugars from the outer coating of the beans. End result - shorter cooking time and hardly any flatulence from the family (which I'm thankful for). As always I usually modify a recipe depending on what ingredients it calls for and what I have on hand. I didn't have any pinto beans so I am using 2 - 1 lb bags of Great Northern beans. I added 1 can of reduced sodium vegetable stock and 1 can of reduced sodium chicken stock. 2 cans of diced green chili. 1 can of rotel tomatoes/green chili. 1 whole onion (diced). 1 tbs of diced garlic. About 1.5 tsp of Mrs Dash. A pinch of salt. A few turns of the pepper grinder. And about 1 tsp of chili powder. Add water to cover. Check every so often for water evaporation. Add extra water as needed. Family loved these beans!!",
