I made my own sunflower seed butter by placing a heaping tablespoon of roasted sunflower seeds in my food processor and grinding them fine before adding a light drizzle of light olive oil. This worked great! I added the banana to the processor and gave it a few pulses to blend everything together including the agave nectar. My only criticism is that there was too much banana mixture to oatmeal. Next time I think half the amount of banana would work just fine.",

So I found this recipe that uses ripe bananas and tried it. I had all the necessary ingredients at hand which is a big plus point of course. I used a little less nectar actually because I can't much sweet at breakfast. But I loved it as did my husband. Will definitely try this again the next time I end up with ripe bananas again.",

Although the Banana has potassium and Fibre which is super good for the growth development and overall health of my kid the oatmeal is a helpful remedy for my sugar level control.
