I needed to cook it in batches though because otherwise it stayed to moist. You really need to let this cook until most of the jusices dry out and you get those crispy parts. I used frsh pepper and onions and also steamfresh corn. Left out the red pepper flakes due to sensitive taste buds and used paprika and a little chili powder in place. Like I said I wasn't too sure about it but it grew on me and I found myself going back and picking at it! That's a 5 star in my book. All of my children loved it and so did hubby.

I have made variations of hashes in the past but I think this one is the best.  I did make some changes to the recipe though.  I used fresh onions and peppers rather than frozen, and I added mushrooms and 2 cloves of fresh garlic.  I cooked the potatoes by themselves for about 15 minutes before I added everything else.  In my other variations of hash I used to add eggs to the mixture itself, but this way was much better.  Rather than dirty up another pan, however, I just transferred the hash to a serving dish and cooked the eggs in the same pan. Absolutely wonderful! Thank you!",
