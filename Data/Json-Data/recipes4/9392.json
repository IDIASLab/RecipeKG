First time I made this I followed the directions by spreading the rice on top of the chicken, however the rice on top did not cook all the way through. After it was finished baking,I also had to take the chicken out stir the ingredients together. The second time, I mixed all the ingredients together in a bowl including the rice, and poured the mixture over the chicken.  If was wonderful!!",
