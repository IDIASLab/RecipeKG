If the cheese runs out, not near as good.  And by the way, if the cheese does start to run out, its done!  Get it off the grill or pan before you lose your cheese!  I tried to make this a little healthier with 94% lean burger....not near as good as when I made the exact same recipe with 80% lean.  You need the fat and grease for a great burger.\nBTW - I saw 1 review that gave 1 star because the cheese leaked out (user error) and 1 gave a low rating because the recipe has a lot of fat.  REALLY?  Rate on the quality of the recipe, not on your ability to cook or you opinion of what is healthy or not.",

I followed the recipe as directed except with lean beef because that's what I had on hand. I was a bit concerned about all of the \"ooze\" warnings so I smashed the patties out on waxed paper between two salad plates so the thickness would be as uniform as possible and turned the edges like a pie crust to seal. Surprisingly none of the cheese blew out it almost \"absorbed\" into the burger. Served it on toasted Portuguese rolls with leaf lettuce tomato and red onion. I had some \"In-a-Pinch Ketchup\" in the fridge (recipe I found on AR) and the flavors complimented perfectly. These burgers are sooo \"slap your mama\" good (no offense \"Cooking Mama\"!) and we just can't wait to try them on the grill!....Thanks for sharing this one.",

I used very very lean ground beef and low fat cheese which helped to mitigate some of the unhealthier attributes of this burger.
