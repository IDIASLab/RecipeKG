I went over the recipe again to make sure I didnt miss anything but..........it was all in there. The next time I made Grouper was last week. I had my Mom over for lunch. I baked it in lemon juice Cant believe its not butter lite and some fish seasoning. Baked it for 25 min and when it was done I placed a home made fruit salad on top warmed up!! IT was a combo of black plums oranges apples strawberries and peaches. Served with french green beans with garlic butter and sliced almonds. Wonderful!!",

I think the instructions need to be slightly tweaked tho b/c if you add the seasonings first and then add the butter the butter ends up removing the seasoning so I suggest using the butter first on the fillets THEN using the seasoning. You do NOT need to use butter for the baking dish that only adds more empty calories. Good recipe thanks for sharing!",
