Other reviewers said the sauce was runny so I omitted the black tea and chili oil. Instead I added Garlic Chili Sauce (Asain aisle in the market) to add some heat. I didn't use the chili pepper but sliced a red bell pepper instead. This was fantastic not to mention healthy and pretty to look at. The next day after my boyfriend tried it he said it was AMAZING! It's always a treat when he gives something I make such a compliment!",
