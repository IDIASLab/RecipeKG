I've changed the ingredients just a bit, but since then it's been among our family's favorite. Now our daughter Jenny prepares it for her family.",

When making this dish I highly suggest using the following gingersnaps... Rippin Good Stauffer's or Lil' Dutch Maid. (Lil' Dutch Maid are the least expensive and I purchased them at the Dollar Tree.) And as for the amount of cookies I use I now add 33 cookies. I also find it's best to use a good quality brand of all-beef wieners (rather than hot dogs or fanks). I now prepare this dish in my chicken fryer and cook this over high heat until it comes to a boil and the gravy has thickened up (in about 10 minutes) and after that I lower the heat to a simmer and cook/simmer the dish just a bit longer for another 10-15 minutes. One more thing I wanted to add... for recipe use a small to a medium size onion. This recipe actually yields: 12-14 servings.",
