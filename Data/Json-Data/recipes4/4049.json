Although we loved the taste of these, I did significantly change the process. For starters, when I mashed my potatoes they just fell apart into clumps, so I realized immediately that there would be no \"tossing\" of these or they would have completely fallen apart.  I also didn't like the idea of combining the oil, butter, parmesan and spices.  Instead I combined the oil and butter, and I separately combined the parmesan and spices.  I drizzled half the oil mixture over the potatoes and then sprinkled with half the parmesan mixture.  I carefully turned the potatoes over and repeated the drizzling and sprinkling.  I assembled this ahead, covered and refrigerated until I popped it in the oven.  After baking for 30 minutes I sprinkled the remaining parmesan cheese on top and broiled for about a minute, then added the parsley.  The potatoes were creamy on the inside and wonderfully crispy on the outside!  YUM!  Since my \"mashing\" skills are apparently not up to par, I will skip that entirely and just cut my potatoes into chunks.  Mashed or chunked give these a try!!!  UPDATE:  I made these again cutting my potatoes into chunks which was much easier for me.  Still tasted great!",

I tried scaling it to 4 servings but that produced wonky measurements. 5 worked though. I found that once I had smashed the potatoes they fell apart so tossing them in the cheese and spice mixture at that point was not going to work. I just spread the mixture on the potatoes while they were on the baking sheet which was fiddly - it was hard to get it to do anything other than stay in little clumps. It would make more sense to me to just smash them as indicated on the baking sheet drizzle the olive oil over (skipping the butter altogether) then sprinkle the cheese and spice mixture on top.",

You can make the recipe as is, or follow the directions only adding whatever spices you want, just make sure you have enough to coat all the potatoes. I adjust the recipe according to how many potatoes I want to have, usually 1 pound. I didn't use the butter, just increased the olive oil. While my potatoes are boiling I mix up my olive oil and spices in a bowl. My favorite mix; basil, oregano, red pepper (or chili spice), tons of garlic and parmesan cheese. As another writer noted, I too, add some cheese on top at the very end and broil. When my potatoes are done parboiling (don't overcook-just enough to spear with a fork), I drain, smash slightly, and mix in a bowl with the olive oil mixture...spread on a cookie sheet, and bake. You can dress this recipe up by using white/red/purple small potatoes...BEAUTIFUL! THANKS for this recipe!!",
