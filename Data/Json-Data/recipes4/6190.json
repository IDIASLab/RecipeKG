A couple of tips: I find it works better with some bigger chunks of cookie. When I crush the candy canes I put them in a resealable plastic bag with a piece of waxed paper underneath and a towel below that. This way any pieces of candy cane that might go through the bag land on the waxed paper and can be used. I use vanilla candy bark and I thin it with about 1TBSP of shortening while heating. This makes it very easy to spread. I press the crushed candy canes into the candy coating after a couple of minutes.",

I loved the white almond bark the best. I quadrupled the recipe, 24 ounces of Almond Bark to 12 regular sized peppermint sticks. I prefer to crush the peppermint sticks very well otherwise they stick in your teeth. I put in a jelly roll pan and chilled for 1 hour. YUMMO! This makes a more chunkier bark, which I loved. I have even done the Chocolate Bark,  White Almond bark and even did a layer of chocolate bark, chilled for an hour, a layer of White Almond bark on top, chilled for another hour. It was good but the White Almond bark is my families favorite. I even told a friend about this recipe and she made it  for her family this Christmas. They loved it too. It's easy and cheap and tastes like store bought. Merry Christmas!",

I also wish I would have pressed the crushed peppermint candy into the melted bark right away. Doing it the way suggested does not keep it from falling off when broken into pieces. It is a very good peppermint bark recipe especially with the oreo cookie bottom!",
