                "reviewBody": "Wow! This is an awesome soup. This little protestant impressed her jewish neighbors with this wonderful soup:) I have to admit to being a bit too frugal to use two whole chickens so I removed most of the meat from a warm rotisserie chicken and reserved the meat in the frig. I then threw that carcass and another frozen carcass in the pot and cooked as directed. I also added two sweet potatoes (as requested by neighbors) and I added 2 Tablespoons of grebenes (chicken cracklings) to the Matzoh ball dough. I do have to say that this makes a huge amount of matzoh balls so next time I may cut the dough in half. These little balls expand very nicely to about double the size. I used my small spring loaded cookie scoop to make perfect 1 inch balls. This helps the problem of over handling and toughening the matzoh balls. Love this and this will be my matzoh ball soup from now on. Thanks so much for sharing JacobAngel. I know there is a special place in heaven for the grandparents who taught you this wonderful recipe!",
