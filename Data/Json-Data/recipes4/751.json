The thicker the slices the longer it takes to bake. The thicker slices of potato may not cook long enough so try to make them the same thickness. The thinly sliced potatoes baked perfectly in the seventy minutes the recipe called for. One other BIG tip is to lightly grease the baking dish for easy clean up!

The mushroom soup was brown so it changed the appearance of the dish I'm sure.  I tripled this recipe for 20 dinnner guests.  We had leftovers that were later devoured before the night was over.  I had to cover the dish with foil because it was browning too quickly.  That may be because I made such a large pan of the potatoes.  I think this dish tastes best if it has a chance to \"rest\" after coming out of the oven. The potatoes firm up a bit.  Will seek out the cream of potato and garlic soup and make this again.

I did the next best thing and bought some cream of potato soup and roasted a few garlic cloves - I imagine the difference would be negligable. The cream is NOT a must for this recipe as it only adds calories and not much flavour. I swapped the cream for some evaporated milk which would impart the creaminess the cream would've given but w/ fewer calories/fat grams. The thyme was a lovely addition but not enough to make this dish \"pop\" w/ flavour. I'll keep it on file for future reference for tweaking...perhaps instead of using rosemary as a mere garnish I'll add some into it...or some oregano and a fontina or provolone cheese as I don't think that the cheddar was a good mesh.
