I'm the Queen of Short Cuts so here's my take- I made them according to the directions, but added about 1/4 t. of Mexican vanilla to the Marshmallows while melting in the butter. (QUICK NOTE* 1/2 CU OF UNPOPPED POPCORN = about 4 QTS POPPED CORN). I had to use microwave popcorn, and that little fact was not printed out on the bags.  I used LITE BUTTER FLAVOR. PICK OUT THE UNPOPPED KERNELS NEXT! I poured the popped popcorn into a large lightly sprayed (with Pam) pot to mix with the melted marshmallow mixutre. MUCHO EASIER to stir together in a deep pot then in the cake pan with low sides! After mixing well I dumped that into a lightly Pam sprayed 13x9 cake pan. I laid a sheet of wax paper over the pan, and gently tapped the mixture out (but not too tight or it squishes the fluff out of it).  I squished a Hershey's Kiss into the center of a few to see how it held. It stuck well, and looked great.  Then, I cooled it for about 30 min, and cut into 25 squares so instead of 8 whompin' sized popcorn balls it produced enough to feed at least 20 hungry goblins..lol. \n\nI've since added M&Ms to them when stirring it all up,and they were also inhaled!\n\nYes, I dirtied a second pan, but it was far easier to wash the second pot then try to stir that huge mixture in such a small pan with 2\" sides.",

This was very simple to make (took less than 3 minutes!) and the results are fantastic. I deviated a bit from the normal instructions and used an air popper (much more healthy IMHO). I also decreased the marshmallows a bit - if I had made this using the standard recipe the balls would have turned out way too sweet for my indvidual taste. The kids will probably enjoy this as well (I have no children so I can't say for sure...). Thanks for sharing Kory. Everyone should give this a try!",
