A frequent request at my house, and at others.  I usually make 100 and put them in the fridge.  They don't last long. Adjust the amount of bacon bits and type of shredded cheese to taste. Increase the recipe as necessary!  Lots of tests helps to best figure out the way you like it. Be sure to wear rubber gloves while seeding the jalapenos -- they will burn.",

The peppers were just right, not too crunchy, not too soft.  I did cook my bacon before adding it to the cheese mixture.  Next time I will add more bacon.  Also, after seeding the peppers they are not very spicy, so I think I will use Jalapeno cheese with the cream cheese for a little kick.  I also sprinkled them with salt after they were fried.  My husband wanted to eat the whole batch right then.  I hope they freeze well, I want to use them when we go to an RV rally.  Thanks a bunch for a great recipe.",

My only changes are that  I use real bacon that I chop up and I blanch the peppers for 2 or 3 minutes before I stuff them.  I grow jalapenos in my garden so I wait until I have a LOT of them and I increase this recipe as needed.  Then I flash freeze the poppers BEFORE frying.  Throw them into a freezer bag and whenever I want some poppers I can fry up as many or as little as needed. They are just as awesome from the freezer and You can get all the hard work done in one day! Thank you for this crowd pleaser!!!",
