Just press down on each shrimp that is covered with coconut & the batter that has had time to meld onto the coconut will catch any lose flakes. I do this each time and never have any problems. Coconut burns easily so I only cook about a small batch at a time so I can monitor their progress and flip faster. Also have paper towels ready after you fry to soak up the excess oil! This was very good but don't get the point in heating your oven up for 5 min when the frying has already finished them off.",
