I did add 2 cloves of minced garlic, baby carrots and Red potatoes, cut in half and unpeeled.  Instead of salt and pepper, I sprinkled McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning on all sides, but don't over do it. I browned the meat on all sides first in a small amount of bacon fat that I had saved. Be sure to scrape all the pan drippings into the crock pot. I thought it would be nice to have a lot of gravy for \"open faced\" beef sandwiches on rolls so I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup and half a can of water.  Wow! I never would have thought Good Season's dry Italian Salad Dressing could pack so much flavor. I see no reason to even try another recipe for slow cooker beef.  This is it for me. Thank you!",

Between the beef broth (even if low sodium), the au jus mix and the italian seasoning mix, you will have more than enough sodium in this recipe. \nI use a 6 quart slow cooker (another reviewer asked what size to use) and I do sear my roast in pan prior to putting in the slow cooker. Then I saute the onion and a few minced cloves of garlic in the pan, deglaze with the beef broth and pour all over the roast. Scrumptious!! And no, your roast will not look like the picture that accompanies this recipe. That roast was NOT made in a slow cooker and it isn't even a chuck roast.
