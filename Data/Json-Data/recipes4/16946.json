I bought an organic whole fryer chicken and was unsure what I would do with it. I found your recipe and gave it a try.  I have often made chicken soup with prepared broth and chicken breasts, but I love your version.  Before I added the vegetables, I refrigerated the broth overnight and then skimmed off most of the solidified fat. I then boiled the broth, chopped chicken, onion and vegetables the next day. I added 1/2 the recommended salt, a little parsley and basil, and I love it!  I boiled the egg noodles separately so I can freeze half the soup. I did not add the spinach.",

Taught him to cut up a whole chicken, added a Bouquet Garni, parsley, thyme, bay leaf, clove,white peppercorn and sprig of Rosemary, 1 onion and 2 carrots, 2 celery stalks.  Simmered for 1 hour and took out chicken breast, then simmered for another 3/4 hr.  Strained the stock then added sliced carrots, 1 ear fresh corn off the cob and the chopped spinach and shredded chicken. We also cooked the egg noodles separately and added to soup.
