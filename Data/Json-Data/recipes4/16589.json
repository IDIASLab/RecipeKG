When we were newly wed we had little to spend on the weekly grocery bill and at that time a chuck roast was a very cheap cut of meat to buy, it was on a par with ground beef.  The dish certainly wowed him at the time, it has always stuck in his mind as one of his favorites so every now and then I fix it.  One reviewer mentioned the high salt content of mushroom soup, well.....one very well known soup company (starts with a C) makes a sodium free mushroom soup, it's rather bland for me but I use it anyway and just salt my dinner after it's plated.",
