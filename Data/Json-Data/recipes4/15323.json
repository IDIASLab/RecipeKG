I used Farro that I got from the missing ingredient site here in Canada and followed the steps pretty much to the letter... but did add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the sugar in the final step. This has a very nice taste and you only need to serve a small amount as it is very rich. The whip cream balances the flavors and the almonds add a nice texture. Fresh raspberries added anther dimension and some color to the presentation.",
