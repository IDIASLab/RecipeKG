I cheated (I'm kind of lazy) and used left over mashed potatoes (made w/just 1% milk and a tad of butter), bagged coleslaw mix, and pre shredded 2% cheddar.  Since I'm a cheater, i had to *guesstimate* the amounts (esp since Mr. LTH got home from work early and helped himself to some of the potatoes I'd set aside!).  I also realized I was out of onion, so I added a couple of dashes of minced/dried.  I had no problem forming the patties...the only problem I had was my impatience in waiting for them to cook...I kept flipping them early, resulting in not the most attractive looking patties.  I made mine first and made them in a non stick pan sprayed w/Pam.  I do NOT recommend this!  Mine had a very *off* taste to them.  I then made Mr. LTH's in the same pan, coated w/a bit of butter and they were FABULOUS!  I also added a couple of dashes of crushed red pepper for a little heat.  TY for a great recipe, sanzoe!!  ",

I followed the recipe almost exactly except I sauteed the onions in a little butter before mixing them into the rest. I did cook it differently as suggested by another reviewer -- I spread the veggies into a 9 X 13 dish and topped them with the cheese then cooked it at 375 for about 30 minutes (until it was warm and bubbly). The food was almost room temperature by the time I did this though since I'd made it an hour or so before I needed it to go in the oven. I will make this again but will probably try it as the patties next time. I will add more Dijon too -- it was there but not strong enough for my taste. Leftovers are apparently pretty good since my husband just ate them for breakfast with lots of Tabasco and some sunny-side-up eggs!:)",

I only used about 5 small/med. pottoes and I got about 8 large patties. Anyway I salted the whole mixture a bit but I also decided to salt the patties as they were cooking. I think this helped with taste. I might try adding more cheese next time simply becuase I couldn't really tell there was any in there as I was eating them. And my hubby LOVES cheese with everything. Lastly I was wondering if a whole onion would be too much-- I love onions in things like this and I thought it was perfect. My hubby doesn't like much onion and he has to have them cooked. He didn't complain at all- in fact he said \"I didn't like potato pancaked growing up but these are really good.\" I did serve these with a sourcream and dried dill weed dip. We loved that.

My potato patties held together just fine but the flavor wasn't much better than just using leftover mashed potatoes and browning them.
