It didn't have the spice or rich flavor of Ghanaian jollof rice. The tomato flavor was overpowering, and it would have been better with bellpeppers than the green beans. If I were to make it again, I would double the cayenne pepper, half the tomatos (exclude the tomato paste or use fresh tomatos) and use more rice and water. I also fried 1/2 the chicken and served it on the side for hubby. I won't be making this again - I'll stick to the tried and true.",

First of all it needs to be pointed out that you need a HUUUUUGE saucepan like a Dutch oven to make this with or you will end up with a HUGE mess like I did. Also cutting a whole chicken up into 8 pieces is not as easy as it sounds. I think I will use chicken PIECES next time. I subbed peas for the carrots and used jarred tomato sauce (i.e. pasta sauce) instead of the paste and only one can of tomatoes. It came out great (despite what I mentioned above)!!!! This is a good one pot meal and you can vary your vegetables--very versatile. I will make this again (in a bigger pot:)",

It is best to exchange rosemary with thyme and remove the nutmeg. The carrots and peas are optional for jollof rice. And the chicken can be cooked seperately from the rice and the broth added in with the tomatoes. the chicken can go in at the end.",

I chose this one as I saw it was a one-pot dish meaning I could keep in warm in large crockpot for the potluck. Not a spoonful was left after the potluck - everyone loved it. I made the recipe just as the recipe calls for with regard to ingredients except I used chicken breasts cut into small pieces instead of the whole chicken and instead of dicing carrots I bought precut raw crinkle cut carrots to save time. The mixture of spices gave it an wonderful flavor that got even better as it simmered in the crock for 3 hours at work. I did add about an extra 1/2 to 1 cup of water to the mixture after the initial cooking period as I knew it would be simmering quite a while in the crockpot and didn't want it to dry out. It was perfect for eating at noontime (I made it that morning at home.) If you like spicy you could add a bit more crushed red pepper but then it might hide the flavor of the rosemary and nutmeg. I stuck to the recipe this first time. It actually was just right for my taste. As I said I doubled the recipe and it more than filled a big crockpot. I even had a bit left that didnt' fit into the crock which I froze and ate later. It was just as good maybe better eating the leftovers. This is a recipe worth making again in my opinion.",
