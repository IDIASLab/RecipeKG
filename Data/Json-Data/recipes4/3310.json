I also used a bag of fresh baby spinach instead of frozen and wilted that with the mushrooms.  I used Classico Roasted Garlic Alfredo sauce and added in 2 TBSP of basil pesto.  Next, I mixed in some petite diced tomatoes that I had drained and then added in the cooked sausage.  Let everything cook for a few minutes and served over bow tie pasta.  Deliciouso!",
