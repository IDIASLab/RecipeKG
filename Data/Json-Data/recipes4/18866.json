I did make some changes just because I have a new Instant Pot so I added the chicken the 1/4 cup water and the coconut juice directly to the pot and pressure cooked for 11 minutes. I followed the recipe for everything else. It was good very moist maybe needed a little something but I don't know what. PS - the ingredient list calls for green onions \"with white and green parts separated\" Step 1 says to \"spread ginger slices and green parts of the green onion on top\" then Step 3 says \"add green parts of the green onion\" to the sauce. Should Step 1 call for the white part of the onion instead of the green part? Otherwise I don't know where the white part would come into play. That's what I did.",
