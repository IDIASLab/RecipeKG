I saut\u00e9ed them on the side in some margarine, along with the stems from the greens. I did not want to throw those away, but know from cooking kale, that the stems take more cooking time. I did not use oil to brown my sausage, as sausage has plenty of fat already in it. When it came time to add the tomatoes and other ingredients, I added my saut\u00e9ed onion mixture. I also simmered this dish for 30 minutes total, stirring occasionally. It was delicious!",
