I LOVE this recipe, it is a pain to do it all right but SO worth it!\nIf you are going to do 4 chiles, go ahead and do 8-12, depending on size; eggwhites in the original recipe will allow for this. I make this 2-5 times a year, but mostly when Hatch, NM chiles are in harvest. We roast 20-40 lbs. of green chiles on our grill then freeze them, setting aside BIG fleshy/straight ones for this recipe so we can cook these all year. Best tip: cheese/flour them on all sides and freeze individually on cookie sheets. Once they are frozen, dump in a freezer bag so you can finish anytime in the winter when fresh isn't available. Cover again w/flour right before dipping in eggwhite then frying. I cook them slightly frozen so the cheese won't melt in the frying pan!\nI usually cook the sauce and only put in the food processor AFTER cooking it all together, so it will be smooth. And I save THAT too, in a freezerbag! When defrosting sauce, I may add fresh lime juice, or other spices to spark it up. MOST IMPORTANT, make sure egg whites are ROOM TEMP before whipping, and oil in frying pan is so hot in an iron skillet, that it is SCARY! Stay on top of it and turn with tongs; drain oil off on paper towels. Serve with sour cream and/or avocados for those that cannot take the heat, plus some hot sauce from MEXICO to keep authentic for those who want more! Nothing is better with this than a slice of lime, and a Negro Modelo Beer in a frosty glass. Enjoy!",

Be sure your oil is hot when you start to batter the chilis so you can lay them directly into the pan.  The batter is kinda delicate, treat it gently  :o)  You can also remove the 1 egg yolk completely & just use the egg whites...I like it either way.  Have fun!",

It's not a super difficult recipe, but will take some time and probably suited for at least the intermediate cook.  But definetly try this one.  Make your sauce while the chiles sit for a bit in the freezer.  I usually tweek recipes that I read, and the only thing I did differently here was to use long cubes of mexican melting cheese (queso quesadilla) instead of the shredded mix, because that is what I had in the frig.  But really, I wouldn't change a thing.  This recipe is PERFECT!",

Everything else was followed. I love this recipe. You can add pepper jack cheese to give it a little kick. I have played around with different types of cheeses. I don't it gets better than this!",

I kept trying to tell myself that all the mess and effort would pay off, but in the end, I was disappointed.  The sauce was delicious on its own, and I plan to keep that part of the recipe for other things, but the finished relleno was missing something, and didn't really have the flavor of a restaurant chile relleno.  A lot of effort that I don't plan to expend again...next time, will just go out for these.",
