I followed the basic bread making recipe and found no need to change up anything, except in how I added the Siracha and the cheese. I love the taste of Siracha and find that most often when I add it to something and it gets mixed in, it loses some of its heat and some of its flavor. I felt that the only way to really showcase it was to pat out the dough and apply the Siracha on the rolled out dough, then add the cheese on top of it, and roll it up Jelly roll style. I brushed the top with an egg wash and sprinkled a little bit of Kosher salt on top of it and baked it that way. The smell was out of this world not to mention how it tasted. I could hardly wait for it to cool down enough that I could slice into it. I've since made it twice and it's gone in a matter of hours. This is an incredibly easy, and show stopping yummy bread.",

I used the handmixer up until I was ready to add the last cup of flour, and it worked out just fine.  I had to use buttermilk (all I had on hand) but otherwise followed the recipe.  Maybe because of the buttermilk, I only had to add about a tablespoon more of that last half cup of flour.  It didn't take very long to knead this by hand, and it was very easy to handle.  I baked it for half an hour, and the internal temperature according to my Thermapen was 196 degrees.  So far all I've done is toasted a piece with butter, but it will make such delicious sandwiches!

I did add vital wheat gluten but my bread doesn't usually turn out this soft even when I do that! I threw all the ingredients in my bread machine and set the dough cycle. When it was done I baked in a loaf dish. Boy did the dough rise and yet it was sturdy enough that it didn't fall. I loved the texture the flavor of the cheddar and sriracha everything.

It has a really nice taste that pairs well with soups. I put all the ingredients in the bread machine on manual and formed a loaf when the dough was ready. My DH also enjoyed this bread toasted for his breakfast. A bread recipe worth repeating. Thanks BigShotsMom for sharing!",
