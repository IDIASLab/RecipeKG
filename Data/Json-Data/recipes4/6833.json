I didn't use all of it probably about 2/3 of it. I ended up slicing up 10 slices using my mandolin. The mandolin ensures even slices and is such a time-saver. Next time I will do about 12 slices (3 rollups per person)because I had a bit of goat cheese left over. I used a 12oz jar of roasted red peppers (there were 2 peppers in the jar) since I couldn't find canned. If you don't feel like dicing the peppers you could also just cut them in strips and lay a couple down the middle of each slice of eggplant. The flavor of these is PERFECT and this comes together easily. The first few I tried were warm and then I later tried a couple that were room temp. Both delicious! Very impressive appetizer or side for company! Thank you BUSYBEE25 for the fabulous recipe!",
