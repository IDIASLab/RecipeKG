        "description": "Not the best picture, I know, but it tastes sooo good! Kewa Datshi - literally meaning potatoes and cheese - is a delicious thick gravy-like Bhutanese dish that is made up of potatoes, chiles, and cheese. Serve it like a soup or along with rice! I had it for the first time when I visited Bhutan and fell in live with its flavors. This is my recreation of that dish and tastes almost the same. An authentic kewa datshi is very spicy but in this recipe I have toned it down as I cannot handle that much spice. But you can adjust the amount of chiles to your liking. Enjoy!",
