All I did different was use Oscar Meyer Turkey bacon ( it's the best) because I can't eat pork added 2 cups peas to the sauce and used 1/2 cup dry white white instead of water. I honestly didn't think it was going to come out as good as it did was pleasantly surprised. I only had the small rigatoni past not spaghetti and my husband and I actually preferred it as the sauce has somewhere to ooze out out of. Lol. He loved it. This was so easy it will definitely be a staple for us!",
