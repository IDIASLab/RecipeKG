I have been searching for a recipe like this, we have a local restaurant that serves a baked tomato soup with veggies in it that is out of this world, and this is the closest I've ever come to recreating it.  I changed a few things, I used a 28oz can of tomatoes, and pureed them before adding them to the soup.  I also omitted the celery, as we don't prefer it.  I added grated parmesan cheese on top, but am going to try feta cheese next time.  Thanks so much for sharing this!",

After sauteing the onions spices and garlic I \"deglazed\" the pan with a bit of white wine waited til it had evaporated and then added the others according to the recipe. I used primarily fresh herbs making up my own Italian seasoning and finished the soup with a touch of sherry and more fresh herbs. Presented with fresh rosemary and shredded parmesan and served with garlic herbed scones. Healthy sophisicated delicious. Thanks for the recipe.",

The first 2 times I did not have a premixed Italian seasoning so I used a combination of dried basil oregano and rosemary. I think the flavor of this soup develops as it stands so I suggest making it a little ahead of time and letting it \"sit\" for at least 30 minutes before serving. As you would imagine the leftovers are wonderful. Great with grilled cheese!",
