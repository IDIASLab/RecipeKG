I chopped the bacon and cooked it in a regular saute pan. I took the bacon out and added the peppers and onions. I added the canned corn and tomatoes at the end. I forgot the milk but I used some cajun seasoning as well as the cayenne pepper. I put the bacon crumbles on top before serving so they would stay crispy. We ate this with ribs and mashed potatoes. Thanks for a good recipe - I can't wait to try it with fresh corn!",

I was skeptical about milking the cob-I cut mine so close there was nothing left(we didn't need it anyway).  I used 2 roma tomatos, 1/2 a large onion and a good dash of garlic powder.  I didn't think the 1/4 cup of milk would do it, but it was perfect.  I didn't use cayenne as then the kids wouldn't eat it.  The adults enjoyed it though the flavor was mild.  Next time I will use bacon grease instead of vegetable oil to step up the flavor a little bit.  Thanks!",

I made it as written using red and orange peppers and frozen corn and adding \"Slap Ya Mama\" Cajun seasoning. I soaked the corn in a mixture of 2% milk and Half and Half while I chopped all the vegetables and fried the bacon. After cooking as directed I put it in a preheated 200 degree F oven to keep warm until transporting to the party. I did add the bacon and green onions before putting the dish in the oven. I plan to make this again as a side dish -- Mardi Gras or not! As someone at the party said \"Why don't we do this with corn all the time? This is SO good!\"",
