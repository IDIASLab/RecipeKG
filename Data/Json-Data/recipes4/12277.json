After pulling out excess masa left inside I filled them with refried beans meat and potatoes then topped them with lettuce tomato cheese and sour cream.(Like a taco) If you aren't use to working with masa don't worry if it feels a bit sticky at first and masa will not expand outward so make them as round as you need room to fill. With that said this recipe comes out delicious every time! I think i'll try breakfast gorditas this weekend.",

In making this recipe,you clearly will need more water than what it calls for simply because the dough should be soft. When the balls are pressed they should not crack around the edges. If they are cracking, then you can add more water to the dough. This dough is very forgiving. I added half a teaspoon of baking powder to the mix to achieve more of a puffed gordita when fried.",
