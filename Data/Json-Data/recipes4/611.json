First I took 5 large yams washed and dryed them and placed them on a cookie sheet and baked in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes. I removed them and let them cool to touch. This made it so easy to remove the skin and slice into 2 inch rounds. I layered the rounds in a baking dish and poured the syrup over the rounds (I used dark Karo Syrup instead of maple) dusted with the nutmeg and cinnamon also dusted with some brown sugar and dotted with butter. I then added half a cup of water to the pan not over the rounds. Covered with foil I baked in a 325 degree oven for 40 mintues. They were perfect!!! Remove the foil spoon some of the syrup over the rounds and serve. Lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.",

He's already asking me to make them next year for Thanksgiving and every year thereafter. I guess they were GREAT. I did read other reviews and planned ahead. I peeled and sliced the yams the night before and stored in the fridge in a baggie(they maintain their quality well). Then the morning of Thanksgiving I steamed in the microwave for 8 1/2 minutes. At this point I proceeded to follow recipe as stated. It made it super easy and fast on a busy cooking day like Thanksgiving. Worth the time just plan ahead. I also cut the syrup down to 1/2 cup as suggested by another reviewer.",
