My actual recipe is as follows: Ingredients ground pepper and lemon pepper 2 teaspoons of each rosemary 2 teaspoons ground coffee 2 teaspoons olive oil (olive oil cooking spray is fine) garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon This is calculated using a 7# rib roast @350 degrees Directions generously oil the prime rib on all sides. grind coffee and rosemary together (you can put in a bag and use a meat pounder's smooth side if you don't have a coffee grinder) until well mixed. Sprinkle on the top and sides of the roast. Then sprinkle with the peppers. Last sprinkle with garlic and onion powder. Use non stick foil and cover for 1st half of baking time (look on the package for time per pound) approx 2.5 hours is the norm. Uncover at halfway point. Check for desired meat temp with thermometer. Take out to rest while meat is still red-pink inside depending on your preference insofar as how well done you like your meat. ENJOY IT IS DELICIOUS!!!",

Unfortunately I did not see the update from the recipe publisher so I used both black pepper and lemon pepper but it was delicious and not too spicy at all. One review comment says it is alright to use cooking spray in place of the olive oil rub. If you are going to spend this much on a cut of meat please use the olive oil - it will make a big difference!",
