Before combining in the baking dish I coated the chops in flour and seared them in a pan for 1-2 minutes per side.\n\nOMG sooo good!",

I also cooked it in a casserole dish - so that the sauce would cover the entire thickness of the porkchop.  Tender meat, and still juicy - and that was with the cheap cut of meat!!  Definately one I plan to do again in the relatively near future.  All the ingredients cost me $6.",
