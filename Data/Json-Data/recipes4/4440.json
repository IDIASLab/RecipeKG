The first one I folded was a little sloppy but then I realized I didnt have to go all the way to the edges when folding and they came out a lot tighter. Instead of frying I baked them at 350F for 25 minutes or a little longer depending on how crispy you want them. I sprayed the baking sheet with oil and then sprayed the briks. Thank you for this recipe! I will make this again.",
