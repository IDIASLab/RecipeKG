Only problem was that it was gone too fast and the local grocery store didnt have crawfish fresh or frozen! The only advice I would give is to not stray from the reccomendation of the Tony Chacheres because we tried some random cajun seasoning that we found because our store didnt have Tony's and it made it really spicy. Oh and when we cooked it we cooked in a few of the heads just to give it some of the flavor that comes out of the head when you suck on it which is some people's thing and others not so much and we sprinkled in some cheddar cheese just to see what it would be like and it was awesome!",

I had frozen leftover crawfish tails from a boil a couple of months back that I'd been wanting to use so this was perfect. I did feel a tad bit guilty making it so quickly but it was so delicious there is no doubt this will be a regular at our house. I only had two hours total tonight to be able to cook AND eat this dish and we made it with time to spare. And my husband shut up and enjoyed every bite!:)",

                "reviewBody": "I made this for dinner last night. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was add some shrimp with the crawfish tails. I had added 2 Tbls of the Tony Chachere's seasoning and barely stopped myself from pouring in the 3rd before I thought to taste it first. It was almost too salty to be edible. I hadn't even added any salt over what was in the soups. I used unsalted butter. Perhaps the shrimp brought some extra salt to the mix. I ended up adding milk (no more 1/2 and 1/2) and another can of cream of mushroom soup to try to cut down the saltiness. It was still a bit strong. With the saltiness aside I enjoyed the flavor and really appreciated the ease of the recipe. I highly recommend the recipe with the caution to slowly add the cajun seasoning tasting often until the desired saltiness is achieved. If you don't get the \"heat\" you want add some cayenne or some other spice that doesn't have salt. Let it be known that I am a salt person. I LOVE salt. This was just way too much!",
