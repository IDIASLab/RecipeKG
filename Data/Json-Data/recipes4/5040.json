I added it to the bok choy about half way through the cooking time.

Followed the suggestions cooking the white pieces with the garlic which I grated over the top, first.  I also grated in a bit of fresh ginger.  When they were softened I added the greens and let them steam uncovered until wilted. Stiring occasionally. I sprinkled some sea salt on when served. The results were great. Light, crunchy, quite tasty and my husband agreed.  We will do this again.  Thanks so much!",
