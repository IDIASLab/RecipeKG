Instead of the vinaigrette(taste preference) i started off with 4 Tbl. of Olive oil the Greek Seasoning and squeezed half of a lemon on top at the end. I used Zucchini instead of Cucumber and also added salt and pepper. This is a VERY satisfying dish with no need for a side! I cannot wait to taste the leftovers cold for lunch tomorrow!",

I did some tinkering; here is my alternative recipe: In lieu of Greek seasoning I sprinkled the chicken with a mixture of 1/2 tsp basil 1/2 tsp black pepper a little bit of salt (maybe a pinch) 1 tsp oregano 1/2 tsp garlic powder and the juice of one lemon. I cooked it in a mixture of olive oil and butter. After adding the spinach I sprinkled it with 2 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar and stirred it. Added cherry toms (whole) in place of chopped tomatoes and kalamata olives (whole) in place of the canned black olives. I also added a bunch of pepperoncini which I think really made the dish. Thanks so much for a great recipe; will def make again!!",
