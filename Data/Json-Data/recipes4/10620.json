I drizzle liquid smoke all over the roast until it's coated - and then cover the roast with sea salt - I never measure.  I put little if any water on the roast and cook it on low for about 10 hours.  I always remove the roast from the crockpot - remove and discard the fat (before my husband can see it) and shred the meat (usually it's already falling apart.) I add a little of the liquid (put it through a strainer) to the pork for flavor/moistness.  I always serve with bbq sauce (sometimes I make my own - sometime I don't.)  Depending on who I'm serving it to (home or work) I add 2 bottles of bbq sauce to the meat - or leave the meat plain and let them top the meat with sauce.  Makes amazing sandwiches - I take this to work often on football Saturdays for the whole department (at least my watch.)",
