I also did 1 C. raisins and that was more than enough. I added 1 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. nutmeg, which added some extra flavor.   I'll do a touch more cinnamon next time. I didn't chill the dough for eight hours, either.  I put the bowl of dough in the freezer for about 10 minutes while the oven preheated, and then put it back in the freezer while each batch baked.  They took exactly 12 minutes per batch and were nice and soft.  I think I'll also try grating the apples with a box grater next time to save the chopping time.",
