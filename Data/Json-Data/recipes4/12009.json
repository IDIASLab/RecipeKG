Husband had been reminiscing about the pickled bologna his best friend's mom made for them when he was a kid. I thought it sounded revolting, but I gave it a try anyway. Have to say that while it's not up there with my all-time favorite things to snack on, it IS pretty darn good. I made it with apple cider vinegar and fresh sliced jalapenos. Haven't reached the 90 day mark yet but I agree that it definitely gets better the longer you let it steep. We have it summer sausage-style with cheese and crackers. Good stuff. Thanks!",
