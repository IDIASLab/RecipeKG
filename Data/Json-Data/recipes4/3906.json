Simple and incredibly inexpensive to make (only *5* main ingredients + all of them can be purchased in large quantities for very little money = not too shabby!).    I made a big pot of this meal for less than $10.  You can't beat it for the amount of rich flavor you get out of this easy recipe.  You won't be disappointed (I could praise this dish all day!).    I can't wait to stop being full so I can eat more of it.  I will definitely be making this again.  SUGGESTIONS ----------------- -Triple or quadruple this recipe because you will want to share it with everyone you know!  Plus, it makes for great leftovers.  -Before adding potatoes to sauce with peas, mash the peas in the sauce or put the peas in a food processor and give a slight chop on them before adding to sauce.  -Season with salt (black truffle finishing salt works great), fresh coarsely ground pepper, and a generous amount of turmeric.  It will change your life.  :)  -I used medium russet potatoes (which are less than $5 for a huge bag) and had no flavor issues.  Baby red potatoes probably would have added to the flavor, but I didn't feel like running to the store to make that kind of commitment.  -I honestly don't know what shelled English peas are, but I used store-brand frozen peas and everything was terrific.",

I didn't have English peas so I substituted with Birds Eye Steamfresh frozen peas that I microwaved for only 3 min. so they wouldn't get overcooked. I added some parsley when I added the salt and pepper just before serving. I served this with baked stuffed salmon and it was wonderful. My husband said he could have made a meal out of this recipe alone....and he loves salmon! I'll definitely make this again.",
