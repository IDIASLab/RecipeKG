I used chicken thighs (because it is what I had) and cooked them for about 40 minutes in the oven with a little stock and the herb rub. IMPORTANT: You have to use fresh herbs. Dry herbs will not work here. I put the SEEDLESS raspberry jam 1 tablespoon of dijon and about 1/2 cup of stock into a small frying pan and reduced it over low heat while the chicken was cooking. After 40 minutes (or so use your judgment) I pulled the chicken and added the juices to the reduced sauce thinned it down as needed and then poured the thick rich sauce over the chicken and cooked it for about 10 more minutes until it formed a nice crunchy topping. I served with rice pilaf (white rice with toasted slivered almonds and craisins) and it was very very good. We will make this again!!",

I'm not a super great cook and I didn't have fresh herbs only dried and unfortunately the cooking time was not long enough for the dried herbs so they were very crunchy and unpleasant.
