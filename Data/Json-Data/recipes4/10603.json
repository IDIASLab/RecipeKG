I kept chicken broth handy to add to the pot as I noticed during the simmering process of the turkey that not much liquid was present and I feared I would not be able to add the dumplings.  Also, I used 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken broth to start (following the others advice).  Last, I followed the bisquick recipe for dumplings (mix and milk).  I love dumpling recipes, and this was a nice and easy favorite.",
