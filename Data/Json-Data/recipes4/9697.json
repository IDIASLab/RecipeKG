Added a dash of Celery Salt, Cayanne Pepper, nutmeg, and thyme\n5. Mixed in about 1/4 cup Parmasean Cheese.\n\nMost of these ideas came from other reviews.

Take out the water and bouilloon; use chicken broth instead (better & fuller flavor) Use 2 cups of half & half and 1 cup of milk.  Substitute 1/4 cup fresh minced onion instead of dried. Add 2 cup of shredded swiss cheese. 1. Saute onion in butter in large saucepan until onion is soft. 2. Add 1/4 c flour, wisk with butter and onion until well mixed.  Pour in chicken broth, wisking rapidly to ensure everything mixes well. 3. Add spinach.  Bring to a boil. 4. Add cream & milk. 5. Add cheese, stirring constantly until all cheese is melted. 6. Season to taste.  (I also added two drops of roasted habinaro sauce which has a really nice flavor without making it spicy.  I hate black pepper so I use other peppers)  This soup was very filling and delicious.",

I've use just broccoli; 1/2 broccoli 1/2 spinach; combo of broccoli and cauliflower; cauliflower, broccoli and spinach. I have used chopped, whole and fresh spinach and had good results each time. I don't really measure, it's just what I have on hand. Never fails and always comes out good. Usually when I add broccoli to the spinach or cauliflower it just tastes like cream of broccoli. Also, I usually put 1/2 cup frozen chopped onions in with the veggies and don't use the minced onions at the end. I also use a hand blender and make the soup nice and creamy. It's such a quick and easy soup. I always have the stuff on hand so I can whip it up in a moments notice.",

Like others I caramelized red onion in the butter added a few red pepper flakes and used chicken stock instead of the water and boullion. Also I threw the cooked spinach and broth and a cup of the cold milk in the blender (be careful after you initially start the blender with the lid on as you need to allow the steam to escape or the blender might explode).",

(i love thick soup). i also used frozen cut leaf spinach since i didn't have the whole chopped frozen spinach but i liked it even better because the spinach was more tender. so overall this recipe gets 5 kick- stars!!",
