It is very moist and the batter will appear very runny. That's ok too. The flavour is pretty typical of banana bread and surprisingly doesn't taste like chick peas. The freaky part is the texture. It is not typical! It is screaming for some nuts. As I was pouring this into the loaf pan, I realized the texture was going to be a little off-putting and I added some pecans. In my opinion, it saved the bread. I only put a fist full and wish I had put more. I will make this again and add at least a cup of pecans or walnuts. My family liked this banana bread and I didn't tell them what was in it so thumbs up for that! I'm glad I tried this recipe. Thanks for sharing  Idena Suzanne.",

                "reviewBody": "This \"Grain Free Banana Bread\" is a nice treat. I quite enjoyed this VERY MOIST (can't emphasize moistness too much) loaf warm straight from the oven, although it did not initially taste like anything in particular (not bananas, not dates, not cinnamon, not ginger, and certainly not chickpeas); however, by the next day it did taste like a very moist banana-date loaf and I had to change my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars. Be sure to make this loaf a day ahead! I would add a lot more spices if I were to make it again so that it would be more like a \"banana-date spice loaf.\" I made mine in my blender (wide-based Kitchen Aid) since I was making my own almond nut flour that way anyway. It has been my experience that baked goods made with homemade almond flour rise better (\"normal results\") than baked goods made with commercial almond flour (\"flat results\"). I blended all the ingredients together well in the blender except the baking soda and dates. I was concerned that my baking soda would go flat in the blender, so I added it at the last second to blend it. I was also concerned that my soft hand-pitted hand-chopped dates would be over mixed, so I stirred them in by hand. My loaf rose well but took took an extra 10 minutes in the oven. Thank you Idena Suzanne for sharing your recipe.",

I have to say I was hesitant at the beginning as I have made loaves with almond flour and turns out flat. Also the chickpeas in the mix didn't totally convinced me so I modified the recipe: I used half cup of chickpeas (instead of 1 cup) and added 1/4 coconut flour and 1/4 of arrowroot flour (still gluten-free!) to add more volume. I didn't have dates or ginger so I skipped them (didn't miss them!) and used only 2 eggs. I added chocolate chips (wheat and dairy free) and some walnuts. I let it cool down in the pan for about an hour or two and then put it in the fridge as it was late at night. I tasted it this morning and it was delicious!!! Next time I will totally use the chickpeas it calls for it makes it a bit denser than if it was only with gluten free flour.",

My husband (a family practice doc) and I are very much into eating healthfully and try to avoid empty carbs as much as possible. So this recipe immediately caught my attention. I made 3 changes to improve the texture but they did not change the overall flavor of this bread. (1) I used almond meal instead of almond flour. (2) I folded in 1 cup of chopped walnuts immediately before pouring the batter into the loaf pan. (3) I used 2 teaspoons of baking powder instead of 1 teaspoon of baking soda because I knew that the batter would react more evenly to the baking powder. The overall texture of the resulting loaf was very good not \"pudding-like\" as some have described. I do think that the better texture was due to my changes. But the flavor is just boring. I'm all for eating more healthy foods but they have to taste good as well. Neither my husband or myself could taste the banana the ginger the dates or the cinnamon in our thick bread slices this morning. And just for the record my bananas were quite ripe the dates almond meal and ginger were fresh. All high quality ingredients... but the flavor was just \"meh\". I am not a person who likes chocolate chips in most things but in retrospect good quality ones might help this recipe immensely. It definitely needs something to add a major flavor boost.",
