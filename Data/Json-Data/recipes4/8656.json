Why attempt to make a 'pizza' with something you don't like? That makes your review a slightly moot point I hate to say. However this recipe is tastier with jarred pizza sauce instead of tomato paste. Tomato paste is just a little too harsh for the sausage/pineapple combination. And if you want it a little more like a Donatos Hawaiian sprinkle some cinnamon on it as well. Very good and thanks for the idea!",
