Instructions omitted saying when to add so added it with the beef. I jullienned the beef because it stayed together better in the burritos. I drained the chilies too. I added half the cheese to the hot mixture just before putting together. After warming tortillas and assembling I poured over any leftover filling and heated covered for 15 minutes @350 sprinkled on remaining cheese and heated only until melted. Served with lettuce and a dallop of sour cream. This is a keeper. Thanks for a great recipe.",

I left out the red peppers and taco sauce and used a can of hot green chili's and tomatoes instead.(including juices from the can) I then added a bit of water to the entire mix boiled then simmered to reduce the water and some of the juices. Added shredded cheese and lettuce as toppings when done. These came out great and we will be having them again. Thank you.",
