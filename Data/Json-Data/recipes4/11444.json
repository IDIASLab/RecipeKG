I have enjoyed the flavor of black beans and orange juice together in other recipes but this one has just too much orange juice. One-fourth cup to one-half cup would be great plenty. Perhaps this is also why the soup is so unattractive looking. The color is more like refried beans. There just wasn't enough interesting flavor and the black bean flavor was completely covered up. It wasn't bad but was very disappointing.",
