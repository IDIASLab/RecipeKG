I normally try and make my meals from scratch but being short on time yesterday after a busy day of errands I saw this and it sounded \"too good to be true\"! This one's a keeper! Super easy to make few ingredients tons of flavor! It's the type of meal that tastes like you spent way more time on. The package of chicken tenders I bought had 8 tenders in it. I kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Some of the tenders were too big to stuff into the shells so I'd trim a little bit off the sides and set the extra bits off to the side. By the time I had stuffed all 8 shells I had enough extra bits to stuff a 9th shell. Even though I used the full amount of sauce stated in the recipe next time I will add slightly more water bc by the end of the hour of cooking the dish was starting to dry out. I would have prefered a little more sauce. I imagine if I would have made the full 14 shells that there would have been an even greater need for more sauce. I had also used 1.5 tbsp of Montreal Steak Spice instead of 2 bc that seemed like a lot. Next time I might even use just 1 tbsp. Aside from the great flavor my favorite thing about this recipe is the ease and simplicity. Thanks for the great recipe Jessica! I normally photograph all my recipes but this one was gobbled up way too fast!",
