More celery salt. Lots of pepper! Tarragon was new, but an excellent addition. I think I used about 1/2 what it called for, though.\nI used CANNED clams, about 10 cans and their juice and added one bottle of clam juice.  Like Mom used to make! Thanks for the awesome base recipe!  Remember, creamy, thick clam chowder is really not authentic.... ;-) Also, my mom took  most of the salt pork out after frying it, and before adding onions and celery! I have to say now that we ate it and it has mellowed... it might be better than Mom's!",

I did make it without the saluted pork as I made it for a vegetarian. I just had crumbled bacon on the side for those who wanted it. The terragon added a nice flavor missing from many of the traditional recipes. I was skeptical since at the time it had no reviews or a picture. Wish I had taken a picture it had good presentation. I did change the servings to 15 instead of 10 and it still turned out perfect.",

                "reviewBody": "Most recipes lack the tarragon but it adds a kick that no other spice seems to carry in clam chowder recipes. The Worcestershire sauce adds a pleasant depth. I always cook my clam chowder with bacon (4 slices) because it's more mild than salt pork. Also clam juice is relatively expensive so I used only one small bottle of it (1 cup) and added 4 cups of water and made up for the flavor with ground shrimp powder (from the local Mexican food store's spice aisle) just until I thought it tasted okay without being overpowering. It was good! Basil and thyme are also good spices to add (1/2 tsp. of each). Instead of two cups heavy cream I used one cup half and half and one package neufchatel cream cheese. It's your choice what to use. It would be a great recipe even without the changes I mentioned. My compliments to Terry for a recipe that is very flavorful and true to a great restaurant style clam chowder.",
