A number of the kernels popped during baking and ended up laying all over my oven floor. The seasonings turned into a charred black coating. That said I still gave this recipe two stars instead of a flat zero. I'm hoping the main problem was the high oven temperature. When I roast pumpkin seeds I use a 250 degree oven. I think I'm going to try the hominy on that temperature and see if I get better results. If so I'll post again and let you know!",

I stirred every 10 minutes and they were done at about 40 minutes. I had 2 or 3 kernals pop but nothing bad. I'd say play with the seasonigns to suit your taste - and taste it before you roast it. If you don't like it before you roasted you probably won't like it after. This does shrink down a LOT so I don't see how to get 6 servings out of this.. more like 2-3:D",
