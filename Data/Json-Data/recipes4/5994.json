I am both a working mother and working with a tight budget this was able to be made in less than 20 minutes could be kept warm in a crockpot until my family got home and could be served with grilled cheese sandwiches (which can be easily made by Daddy) with easy clean up.

Then I added everything as indicated in recipe but added a can of NON-PUREED black beans & about 1/2 c. of chicken broth. I cooked it as directed adding about a cup of corn at end some shredded cheese for garnish and it was WONDERFUL! So glad I found this recipe.
