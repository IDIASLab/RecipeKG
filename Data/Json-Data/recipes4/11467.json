I have made just a few minor adjustments.  1) I use 2lbs of chicken breast 2) to deal with the dryness  -> I cook the meal for about 5-6 hours on low rather than high.  The chicken is cooked through, but it isn't dry.  3) To give it a little more flavor -> I add at least 3 garlic cloves, although usually 5 or 6 b/c my family really loves garlic. 4) To decrease the salt -> I use 1/3 c low salt soy sauce to avoid the really salty flavor.  It wasn't too salty for me, but my husband said the first time I made it that it was too salty.  5) To thicken some sauce -> I take most of the sauce out of the crock pot and put it in a skillet.  I add about 1-2 teaspoons (slowly) of corn starch to thicken the sauce.  This has really made the difference in my opinion.  We take the sauce and put it over the chicken and rice.  With all of these additions, this recipe's really good.",

Talk about absolutely delicious.  This recipe is the ticket.  I've been getting into slow cooker recipes ... having purchased a huge new slow cooker recently.  Since I love chicken, I was on the hunt for a recipe that would provide an interesting spin on chicken.  This recipe did the trick.  You just can't go wrong with this one.  Do note; I suspect slow cooker cooking times vary significantly.  I've noticed that my new large slow cooker seems to often cook recipes in half the time as what the recipe calls for, including this one.  Be warned.  Thankfully, I checked the chicken after two hours and it was DONE, and I cooked it on LOW.  The sauce makes this recipe so awesome ... it almost has a sweet and sour aura about it.  Have it tonight!",

I also made egg fried rice with day old cooked rice and peas and green onions and we also added the reduced sauce on top of the rice. My kids (3 and 5) and my hubby loved it!

I put a crushed garlic clove inside the chicked along with some green onions. It came out delicious. I think I could have used all the honey and it would still have been fine. I added some sliced potatoes to the crock pot and they absorbed the juices and tasted delicious. I did not thicken the juice since we liked it just the way it was. We poured it over the chicken on our plates to soak it up which made the chicken so juicy. I will make this again.",
