I had a little carton of heavy cream sitting in my refrigerator, so I decided to see if it would work for me.  You can tell it's ready when it goes from being perfectly white and smooth to being yellow with lots of little chunks (like cottage cheese), and there's milk in the food processor.  I didn't bother straining it or squishing it with a spoon, I just dumped it all into a bowl and picked up the curds and squeezed the milk out of it with my hands.  The milk tastes good, too!  And remember you can do just about anything with it, add whatever seasonings and herbs you like and even a little bit of fruit for yummy strawberry butter or whatever.",

Thoroughly rinsing your butter will make it last longer -- otherwise it gets an off/sour taste.  We put our butter in a wide, shallow bowl, pour ice water on it, work the ice water through with a wooden flat spatula and then drain.  We continue that process until the drained water is clear.  At that point, we work in our salt using the spatula.  If you oversalt the butter, just use cold water to rinse until sufficient salt is removed.",
