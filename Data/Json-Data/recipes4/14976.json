                "reviewBody": "This recipe has potential but also has some problems. First the 10 cups of liquid for 1 lb of rice turned my rice into gelatinous sludge and way too much of it. Next time I would use a 1/2 lb of rice and cook it to package directions with the addition of toasting the grains first for about 2 minutes in a Tbsp of oil on med high heat. This will reduce the starchiness. Be sure to use a combination of light and dark meat chicken (or all dark meat) for the best flavor. I added in some whole cardamom pods whole black peppercorns 1 Tbsp ground cumin and an extra tsp of ground coriander to the chicken while it cooked giving the sauce a more complex flavor. I would also recommend tripling the amount of fresh herbs. Also I sprung for some saffron which imparts a great flavor. But for those of you for whom saffron is unavailable or cost prohibitive you can steep a few whole cardamom pods and a pinch of paprika in the butter/milk mixture for a few minutes to get a similar effect.",
