This is much better than the many lousy store-bought dressings that I've tried!",

My advise on the recipe would be to do the following: 1) Garlic too strong so decreased to 3 cloves. 2) Used a 16oz block of silken tofu instead as that's what I had at the store. 3) Do not add water it's nicer to have a thick rich dressing. 4) For all other ingredients increase to 1.5times the current recipe. 5) Double the Parmesan. I know that's a lot of changes but this is what worked for me.:-) Play with proportions until you feel like it works for you.",

I intended to use this as a dip so I started adding the water with only 1/2 cup and went from there. I also only put 1 clove of garlic, not being much of a garlic fan. I also used vegan, gluten free Worcestershire sauce. I did enjoy it and will make it again. It went very well with spicy baked zucchini fries and imagine it is delicious on a salad.
