I didn't add salt bc I try to cook without it. I used about 2/3 cup of low sodium chicken stock instead of water and boullion. I used the flat side of a spoon to smoosh the garbanzo beans and spices together which seemed to work better (and was cleaner) than using my hands. I found that it needed longer in the oven; I liked it browned on top. Served with turkey tenderloin and green beans. Will make again!",

It is great to have something so healthy for me that tastes like a food that I would usually try and eat in moderation without it being full of chemical ingredients I can't pronounce. It is a little dryer than stuffing made with bread iw but it isn't dry in and of itself. I love sage but found it to be a little too strong. Next time I will try using about 3/4 the amount called for. I took another reviewer's advice and used a spoon to mash the beans-- definitely easier this way. Thanks for a great healthy recipe that will be on my menu at least once a month!",
