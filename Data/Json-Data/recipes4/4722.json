I then fried up the cabbage and onions in the sausage drippings-- gave the cabbage a nice flavor added boiled pierogies until heated through. I combined everything in the crockpot & left it on keep warm until it was time to eat. My husband said it didn't look like it would be any good but then RAVED about it!
