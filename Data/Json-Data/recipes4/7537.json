I love that they can be made ahead of time and then a quick spoonful in a cup to serve. You can never make too many - they will fly in a second. The BLT mix can be made in advance and kept refrigerated. Remove from fridge 1/2 hour before serving. You can use butter instead of olive oil, if desired.",

I intended to buy wonton wrappers, as per the recipe, but the grocery store was out (shocker, lol), so I ended up using mini fillo cups, which worked great! These really do taste like mini BLT's. I could even see just using this as a dip w/ crackers or toasted bread pieces or just on toasted bread for a sandwich. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I then took the leftover shells to school the next day along with the toppings in one container and the mayo/mustard combo in another container. At lunchtime I quickly assembled the ingredients and had a delicious treat for our lunch. Everyone LOVED them and it was very easy to transport and whip them up in under 10 minutes. Thanks Raquel for a fun hors d'oeuvre that was enjoyed by all.",
