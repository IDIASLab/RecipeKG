Others say it\u2019s perfect for a family meal but not for a dinner party.   If you have the time to experiment, this basic dish lends itself nicely toward gourmet modifications.  We used one pkg. of Country Gravy mix (as did other reviewers), but with 1-1/2 cups of water, rather than the one cup called for in the recipe, and lots of fresh cracked pepper.  What really made it over-the-top delicious was adding about 1/2 cup of a high-quality dry sherry to the gravy mixture, along with about 1-1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning.  We saut\u00e9ed one large sliced onion and a lot of sliced fresh mushrooms in butter and sherry until golden.  We then layered the saut\u00e9ed onion/mushroom mixture over the chicken pieces, and topped it off with the COMBINED mushroom soups and gravy (thus eliminating the need to drag a hot dish out of the oven halfway through cooking time).  Our chicken was very thick, so cooking time was extended.  This is definitely the most tender chicken you could ask for!  Served atop white rice with a crisp green vegetable on the side.  Everyone raved.",

I have to say i was a little worried when i first read this recipe b/c i have made baked chicken with a can of mushroom soup on it before but this was NOTHING like the plain taste of chicken and mushroom soup. I did have to make a few changes: only my husband and i so i used 2 large chicken breasts 1 can of cream of chicken soup 1 packet of peppercorn gravy mix 1/2 an onion 1/2 cup of water and i did brown the chicken breast but like i said it was the yummiest dish. I served with mashed potatoes (covered with the gravy) and corn on the cob. Next time i make this i will make more so we have leftovers:)",

It was really \"runny\" gravy after cooking all day... So I added two cups of brown rice and let it cook for another hour and a half and that thicken it right up. It was pretty good. If I make it again I'll add baby carrots to the mix too. It was very filling. Next time I'll add more peppercorn gravy mix I would have liked it a bit more \"peppercorn-y\". Otherwise Very good!
