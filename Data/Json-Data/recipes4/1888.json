We aren't fans of frying so we baked ours on 375 for 25-30 minutes.  Will definitely be adding this to our dinner rotation.  ",

I used about 3/4 of the ranch dressing package, and it was pretty strong; I was using flounder, which is maybe the mildest fish in the entire world, so that might have contributed, but I couldn't imagine using the whole package.  I like the ranch breading idea, but I think next time I might try a different method - maybe people who are dredging the fish in milk first have the right idea.  My oil-and-dressing mix never came close to anything like a \"paste\" (again, I didn't use the whole packet) and I didn't have enough for all of my fish.  Anyway, though, good flavor - particularly for people who don't like fish.  I baked at 375 for 10 minutes.  Edit:  I tried it again with tilapia, baked at 375 for 10 minutes.  This time I mixed the dressing mix with the breadcrumbs and lightly brushed the filets with olive oil - delicious!  Just the right amount of tang.  I'm upping my review to 5 stars.  Thanks!  EDIT AGAIN:  just printed out a copy of this to give to somebody else, and realized that I don't actually follow this recipe at all.  My version is 5 stars, but I'm sending this one back to 4.",
