One unwritten rule of crockpot cooking is: don't leave dairy products (namely milk or cheese) in the crockpot for extended periods of time.  It will separate and just not work.  So here's what I did.  I put the chicken (used one large boneless chicken breast) in the crockpot with 3 cups of broth and all of the veggies except peas (omitted mushrooms).  3 cups of broth worked well- I don't see how it could have worked with 1.  About an hour and half before we ate, I shredded the chicken and added the frozen peas (2 cups, not thawed).  Then 30-45 minutes before we ate, I mixed one can (forget \"one cup\") of 2% evaporated milk with the flour in a large liquid measuring cup.  Added that in and turned the slow cooker to high.  Cooked until thick enough.  Served with Butter Cresents from this site- yummy, good, comforting and filling!  With my changes it's a 5, but as written, I'd say 3.... so I guess I'll give it a 4.",

I let this all cook on high for 2 hours, then I chopped the chicken breasts into bite-size pieces. I added 6 oz of mushrooms (sliced in half) and let cook for 2 hours on low. I added 3 potatoes (cubed) and 12 baby carrots. I let it cook another two hours, then I added a cup of frozen peas and let it cook another half hour. I mixed around \u00bd cup flour with a 12-oz can of evaporated milk and mixed around 3/4 of this into the stew and let it cook around 45 minutes longer. I was very good with homemade biscuits! I agree that you should NEVER add dairy in the beginning of slow cooking. I have found, though, that if you have something start to separate in the pot, you can stir in some sour cream to help bring it back together.",
