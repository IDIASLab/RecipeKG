I followed the recipe as directed using maybe slightly less cheese than called for and italian breadcrumbs rather than plain and adding salt and pepper. I would agree with a previous comment that suggestes to start baking the eggplant skin while chopping and cooking the other vegetables. The skin came out a bit tough for us though not inedible. Cooking the skin a bit longer before stuffing should solve this. I'd also add the cheese topping about ten minures into baking the stuffed eggplant to make it melty and gooey rather than hard. This was the first time I've ever cooked an eggplant dish and I'll make this again!",

Another thing you could probably do would be to cook the eggplant skin in the oven will everything else is getting chopped and cooked. Although I wan't able to eat the skin it was good.
