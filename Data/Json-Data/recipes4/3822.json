I'd never bought applewood smoked bacon but managed to find some (it wasn't cheap!). I didn't cook the bacon by time (\"about 10 minutes\") but by feel and I think it took less than that. My slices of whole wheat bread were larger than the usual small squarish bread. It was a pretty tasty sandwich - not the best ever but still worth making again especially since I have the ingredients on hand still. One minor quibble: I thought there was too much honey here as maybe half of it dripped off the sandwich while I ate it. I'm not a huge fan of honey anyway so maybe I'll cut it in half next time.",
