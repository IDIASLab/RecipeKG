My grandson (8 yr. old) said they tasted like carrots. He did eat his whole serving. If you want more of a crust on your quiche add 1/4 cup of flour to your egg mixture. Because I often add Tabasco sauce on my cooked scrambled eggs or omelette I added hot sauce on top of my serving. I would make this again if I wanted a sweet potato for my meal. I would not buy a sweet potato so I could make this though.",
