                "reviewBody": "I made a strawberry cake once before and it did not turn out. So when my youngest son asked for a strawberry cake I was a bit nervous. This recipe was great! Everyone loved it and told me to hold onto the recipe. Typically the first time I make a recipe I leave it exactly as is however I did make a few adjustments to this one. I didn't use a mix I just mixed up a yellow cake from scratch and I baked it in a 9x13 cake pan. I didn't want to buy a whole jar of strawberry jam since I had strawberries in the freezer I just blended them up and cooked them down a bit so they had a thicker consistency. Now I am really glad I did that because those strawberries only had a little sugar in them and I think strawberry preserves would have made this cake too sweet. Lastly since my son just turned three I thought he would like strawberry frosting more than cream cheese frosting. I still mixed it with the cool whip which I think I will do for every frosting from now on. I know it sounds like a lot of changes but most of them are pretty irrelavent I just thought I would list them in case it changes something for someone else. Definitely a great recipe!",
