Secondly  I used olive oil to sautee the onions and garlic.  I sprayed the mushrooms with butter flavored pam before cooking.  I did as others suggested and cooked the mushrooms in the microwave for 5 minutes before stuffing to reduce the water content.  I also used a melon ball scooper to remove the stems.  It worked great! Finally, I used turkey bacon.  I used skim milk and a little cream and they held together great.  I sprinked parm. cheese on them right before baking.  Best mushrooms ever!  I promise you won't miss the fat!!",

Instead of large mushrooms I used regular mushrooms so that they were more of a \"finger food\". I also made the filling the night before so that it would cut down on the prep time for the next day. These were so yummy that my friend who doesn't usually eat mushrooms, wanted the recipe!!! A must for any gathering....",

I used 3/4 c of fresh spinach but next time I will probably use a whole cup. I might also make 1 1/2 times the filling so I can pile it on high. Also a good tip would be to sautee the mushrooms before baking to get the extra water out of them. They were kind of messy to eat with the juice dripping out of them.",

I suggest investing in a melon baller if you make these often it makes it much easier to remove the stem. Fantastic recipe Gail - thank you!!",
