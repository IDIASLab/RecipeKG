Also didn't have any tumeric so I substituted with onion and garlic sazon. For the rice I used whole cloves and subbed the almonds for craisins. I also used basmati and the rice came out subtle sweet. Overall I loved the dish and it was easy to make. Next time I might try to make the chicken in a slow cooker.",

I forgot to cover the pan so the sauce didn't work out so well and it dried onto the chicken but I spooned what was on the bottom of the pan over the chicken and that went a long way. Used brown rice for the the rice dish. It was okay. Will probably use again.",
