I saut\u00e9ed those ingredients together with sweet white onion rather than the green onion, and added fresh minced garlic for extra flavor.  I love adding pimiento to my Chicken a la King and knew I would love it here too.  Poultry seasoning isn\u2019t something I have at our home in Naples so I had to be creative with what I had -  a little Penzey\u2019s Fox Point Seasoning (for those unfamiliar with our Penzey\u2019s Spices in Wisconsin, Fox Point is a suburb north of Milwaukee),  some Montreal Chicken Seasoning and fresh chopped parsley, rosemary and thyme.  What I knew I wouldn\u2019t like was the flour, knowing it simply would not be necessary and in fact, might even result in a consistency I wouldn\u2019t care for.  I omitted it entirely.  Hubs is not a big fan of wild rice and I must admit I knew I would much prefer it mixed  with regular, long grain rice.  I used a 50/50 mix of both, simmering the wild rice in all broth, no water, for 45 minutes, then adding the white rice and simmering for another 20 minutes.  Even without the flour I needed to add more chicken broth for my liking. This was creamy and satisfying, and gratefully not too rich \u2013 NOT adding the flour was a good call.  Still, with all that\u2019s going on with this soup, particularly with my additions, it still fell a little flat. No doubt adding some bacon and a glug of white wine would fix that right up.",
