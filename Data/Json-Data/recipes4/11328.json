Thank you all for the very nice comments and I'm  happy to see that some of you have found alternative methods of preparation. I too have experimented a bit with the ingredients especially trying to find ways to make it less fattening.  Ground turkey and ground chicken are great substitutes for ground beef and I've even successfully used chicken meat chopped fresh and from a can. To my Cuban critics let me just say that originally, there were no cajun spices,(I use Tony Chachere's), no chipotle(which isn't necessary at all to the mix; and the chipotle I used is in a powder form), and orginally the olive used was green, stuffed with pimento.  I believe my friend used a 1/4 - 1/2 tsp chile powder and red pepper flakes, or some equilivant.  You could use any type of hot pepper sauce, but I like to add habanero sauce to mine now; but let me just say that if you do use habanero sauce, in respect to your family/friends that don't like the heat, use only one drop.  Habanero sauce is alot like garlic in a recipe, less is better just for flavor, and more is overpowering.  This is an easy recipe for sure and I'm glad those of you who've tried it have found as flavorful as I.  And yes to the reviewer concerning the name, it should be named Frijoles Cubanos; I was just so excited about listing it online that I got it backwards.",
