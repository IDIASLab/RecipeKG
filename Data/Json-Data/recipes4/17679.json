Uncover and reduce heat so the water is just barely simmering a few small bubbles. Maintain this heat throughout the poaching process. Place 2 paper towels on a large plate. Crack 1 egg in a small bowl. Gently swirl your water with a spatula in one direction and slowly pour the egg into the center of the pot. Gently swirl the water a few times around the egg then let it be for 4 minutes. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on the paper towels; repeat for each egg, using the same water.\n"
