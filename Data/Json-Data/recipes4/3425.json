My package of ground turkey was 1.25lbs and I made 15 meatballs. When I added the sauce I spooned some on each meatball and I flipped them over when baking was done before letting them rest. I also resisted the urge to just put in the whole can of diced tomatoes and measured out 1 cup as written. Yum!! You can't taste the Dr. Pepper and I bet you'd get the same result with Coke too. I served them over rice and fresh broccoli. Everyone loved them!!",
