I used 6 slices of bacon, 8 eggs, 1-1/2 cups light cream, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, 2 pgk. (10 oz.)fresh baby spinach, steamed, 2 cups chopped mushrooms, sauteed in 2 Tbsp. bacon grease along with 1 cup onions.  I used 1/2 pound of swiss cheese, which amounts to 2-1/4 cups (no cheddar).  I saved 1/4 cup of the cheese to sprinkle on top.  Mixed all ingredients together, baked at 375 for 35 minutes.  I spent 45 minutes on prep time, plus the quiche needs to sit for about 10 minutes when it comes out of the oven.  I couldn't see how I could mix raw spinach and raw mushrooms with the liquid, so cooked them lightly, and it worked out great.  Sorry for the long review, but making these changes is the only way I will use this recipe again.",

The quiche was watery when I first cut it, and I had to drain off quite a bit of liquid.  Also, the onion in it was crunchy (undercooked).  I think you need to first saute the onions to soften/pre-cook them, possibly sauteing them with the mushrooms to exude the excess liquid from them first.",
