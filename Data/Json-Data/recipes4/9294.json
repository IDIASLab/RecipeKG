(Just a once in a while treat I'll give myself)\n\n4) The rolling pin you use makes all the difference in the world. If you are using one of those big fat ones with handles on the side you are never going to get anywhere.  A regular wooden pin with no handles & about an 1 1/2inch diameter is what you need. \n\n5) If you over roll them they will get hard & tough. Once up from the center & once down from the center flip over & rotate 90degrees.\n\n6)Practice practice a couple of wasted batches don't worry its only flour & water no big loss & you can always make chilaqueles from hard tortillas!",

If you're not used to making tortillas or grew up around them daily the rolling out of the tortillas can be tricky.  Just a couple of hints:  Sprinkle a little flour on your surface and your rolling pin to keep the dough from sticking. Start in the center and roll up once and back to the center to roll down and then you need to keep turning the tortilla a couple of inches after you roll it out.  It's so much easier once you get the hang of it.  Store bought tortillas just don't taste like the real thing.",
