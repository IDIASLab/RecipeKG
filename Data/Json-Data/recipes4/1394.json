The smell of that awful sauce permeated the house for a day. Try a simple BBQ sauce on a low heat recipe before this one.",

I didn't have spareribs on hand but had a boneless pork roast that I sliced into approx 3/4 inch slices. This recipe was great the sauce was amazing! I will definitely make this again and may even try it on chicken. The only thing is I mis-read the amount of hot sauce and used 2 tablespoons instead of 2 teaspoons - there was a definite tang but it was alright. I will be sure to use the correct amount next time! This recipe is a keeper!",
