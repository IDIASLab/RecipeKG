Easy to prepare, but remember to start this a couple hours before you want to eat.  As a great bonus it makes your house smell great.  A couple of substitutions that I made were using 1/3 cup of wild rice pilaf instead of just wild rice, this worked out perfectly.  I also used 1 cup of low sodium canned chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water which worked well too.  Also, I liked adding 2 Tbls of golden raisins to the butter, almonds, and onions for the rice stuffing.  It gives it a nice sweet dimension.  Also, if you don't have any slivered almonds on hand you can use any others nuts.  I just chopped some mixed nuts and used those and it was still yummy!  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!!",

My husband absolutely loved the cornish hens. The only thing that I changed (for time constraints) was the wild rice. I used the Uncle Bens Microwave Rice to start the cooking on the rice and then I added butter and cooked it on the stove top to get the long grains softer. A tip that I would give anyone that uses this recipe is to make sure the rice is cooked thoroughly before you stuff the hens and make sure you do leave the skin on while baking; otherwise your hens will get dry. Overall I would say that this recipe was very good. A",
