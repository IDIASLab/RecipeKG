To make this more spicy, you can add fresh chiles or hot red peppers crushed. I don't like really hot food, so this was perfect for us. The vinegar makes it have a bit of a bite to it. You can add a bit more or less depending on your taste. Boil 2 pounds noodles; when done, pour sauce over noodles on your plate.",

I tried this recipe because although we like spaghetti, we are not huge tomato lovers, and I'm looking for a good homemade sauce that I can make in large batches and freeze. I did double up this recipe, and it will feed my family of five 3 different meals, with leftovers. I liked the peppery taste, but I like peppers. My family weren't such big fans. I almost added some garlic to this, but didn't in the end because I wanted to test this as is. I missed the garlic. I found I was out of both oregano and thyme, but had Italian herb seasoning, so I used that (a full 1/4 tsp per batch).  Like I said, it was good. I would eat it again. But I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again. I would rather just buy it premade from the store.",
