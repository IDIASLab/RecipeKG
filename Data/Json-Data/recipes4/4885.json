Vendors sold grilled corn on the cob prepared with butter, mayonnaise, cotija cheese, chile powder and a lime wedge.  They were so delicious!  After moving, we'd crave this corn, so I altered the recipe using canned corn and  mixed in the same ingredients for a similar treat that doesn't require an outdoor grill.",

Next time I will just pass the cheese around for everyone to top their corn with, and I will cut back just a tad on the lime juice, I did use the full 2 tablespoons, next time I'll try 1 1/2 tablespoons. I added about 1 tablespoon of chopped cilantro as well because I love cilantro. I served this with grilled steaks, the liquid from the corn ran onto the steaks, and my wife loved the combination of the sauce and the steak.",

From tamales, chicharones, and corn, these vendors are out on the daily (and sometimes nightly) basis. I strongly recommend using cotija cheese and, if you're lucky enough to have it, authentic Mexican cheese. If you can't get either, then try something like crumbled Feta cheese. It's salty enough to mimic cotija cheese. I used Feta all the time when I lived overseas and couldn't get cotija. Corn on the cob, whether grilled or boiled, tastes the best; but when there are no other options, canned or frozen corn will do.",
