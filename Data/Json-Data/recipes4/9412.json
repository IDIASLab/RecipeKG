Used only 1/2 c butter and put that in my stock pot. Sauteed the onions and chicken in that. (By the way cooking onions in butter gives them a wonderful sweet flavor and infuses the butter with said flavor dispersing it throughout the casserole. Mmmm!) Stirred in chicken broth in place of water stirred in soup stirred in milk in place of water stirred in my selection of herbs spices and seasonings. I used half seasoned stuffing and half unseasoned. Tasted it and decided to lose the cheese. Poured it into a 9X13 and baked it. My changes for future attempts will be to add another cup of stuffing then let the whole thing sit in the stock pot for about 10 minutes so the liquid is better absorbed. (The center was a bit runny. Still delicious!) I'm thinking this will be a good \"base\" recipe. I'm considering trying smokey spicey sausage with cornbread stuffing and diced tomotoes for some southwestern flavor and maybe some beef roast with mushrooms and wild rice stuffing.",
