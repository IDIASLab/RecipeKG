I have found that the flavor is best if you cook it the day before and reheat in the oven at 350 for 20-25 minutes.  This also lets you degrease the dish fully since short ribs can release alot of grease.",

The liquid only went up about 1/2 way on the ribs and it took a long time for them to break down.  I added a bay leaf when I added the vegetables and that gave it a great flavor.  I also added quite a bit of water when cooking the vegetables.  This was a great meal with fresh bread, good wine and great friends.  Thanks.",

I then put the beef, carrots, onions, tomatoes,  garlic and two beef bouillon cubes in the pressure cooker for 25 minutes.  I cooked the potatoes separately in water while waiting.  I removed the meat from the cooker, and thickened the liquid, (including the carrots and onions) with the flour and water.  I served the potatoes and ribs in separate bowls, and the liquid in another.  A smash hit, eaten entirely in one sitting by two teenagers!!!  They even asked for the same meal the next day!!",

The last time I made this I chopped up a couple of Aneheim peppers and added it for a little more zip (BAM in Emeril's terms.) For those of you who are afraid of the word 'chili peppers' Aneheims are not hot at all however you may discard the seeds if you wish. My grand daughter loves them and she's only eleven. (not latin either.) If you've never tried this recipe before read the reviews first and pay attention to the repeated changes it will make it worth all your time and effort.",
