We doubled the recipe actually and sent the remainder (which was quite a bit) home with them for the rest of the week so they didn't have to cook. Yea it was that much. The only thing I would do differently is cut down the amount of Penne noodles the recipe calls for. The dish itself is so good that you end up looking for a fork full without the noodles. They work well together but I will probably use half the noodles next time.",
