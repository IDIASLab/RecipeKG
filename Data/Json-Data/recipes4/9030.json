Oh and I didn't have any tater tots but I did have frozen hash brown patties so I just used those...worked perfectly! Not that this needs more fat lol but this would also be great topped w/ a bit of mayo. This is not something I could eat everyday but for a treat or when a craving hits I will def be making this again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
