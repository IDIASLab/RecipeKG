I mashed up the insides and mixed in some melted butter milk salt and pepper and then proceeded w/ the recipe. I used my large cookie scoop to portion the mixture into the pan and then just flattened them and let them cook. These had great flavor (loved that these were fried in the bacon grease) and sort of reminded me of a cheesy hashbrown YUM! We make something similar to these except putting more of an Italian spin on them...this is a wonderful alternative to those and one I will be making again! Thanks Rae for sharing such a great recipe!:)",
