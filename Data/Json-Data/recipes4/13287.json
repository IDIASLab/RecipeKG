Seriously, it was very yummy.  I did follow the tip from another reviewer and decided to broil the ribs a second time right before serving them to give it that extra little crunch.  My husband just added a little extra bbq sauce and popped them under the broiler.  I cooked them the entire 8 hours on low (no medium setting on my pot) and did not have mushy ribs at the end.  I will be using this recipe again when other in-laws come to dinner.",

I broiled the ribs for 5 minutes on each side, and since my slow cooker didn't have a medium setting, I did 2 hours on high and 3 hours on low. I didn't add the water because the ribs gave so much natural juice. I also used 3/4 of a 40oz bottle of Jack Daniel's Original BBQ sauce. It had all the smokey flavor I wanted. I ended up making pulled pork with this recipe, but if I wanted to keep them as ribs, I would have just basted them with extra bbq sauce and broiled them again for a little crisp, since I don't have a grill. Definitely worth a try! Great with corn bread :)",

Was not an option on this day, so I looked up a crockpot recipes and found this one. All I can say is that I will be making these again.  Better than any I have add. I did a dry rub on them prior to broiling in the oven, and placed them in the crockpot.  Set the timer for 4 hours.  Removed ribs and placed on cookie sheet, basted them with Sweet Baby Rays, and broiled them till they got a good crisp.  I think my husband was little jeoulous, all we would say is \"I think I'll let you cook these again\" haha.  I agree with the reviews, 8 hours would of been way to much time.",
