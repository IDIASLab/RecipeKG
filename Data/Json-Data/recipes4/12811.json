I've made veggie burgers with just about everything, and we were so pleased with how the polenta held up.  A good alternative to this recipe is to use the tubed polenta rather than dry.  We used brown rice, & I added an egg and 1/2 c wheat germ to get to a good point of sticky as not to fall apart while cooking, which so often happens to veggies.  These cooked beautifully.  Rather than add in cheddar, we put on provolone while \"frying\", which we did in just a bit of evoo.  Thanks for a wonderful idea!  Polenta veggie burgers are definitely making the rounds.",

Good call because these were great. I served them as a side instead of a main dish and used a mustard sauce from this site to top them with. Excellent! If serving in a bun as a \"burger\" you will definitely need some type of sauce for they are a little dry on their own.",
