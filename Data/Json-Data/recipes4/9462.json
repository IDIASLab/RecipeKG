                "reviewBody": "If you are looking for the world's best pumpkin pie this isn't it. It is however a great sugarless pumpkin pie. The texture is much lighter and fluffier than regular pumpkin pie -almost more like a heavy mousse than a custard. (I assume this has to do with using powdered milk rather than condensed milk which you can't use if you want the pie to be sugar-free.) As another reviewer mentioned the pie is not very sweet. This is true but I kinda like that. I'd rather have the sweetness come from the whipped cream. The flavor is going to depend very heavily on what pumpkin spice blend you use. The recipe I used (from Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book) was a little too stong on the ginger and maybe the nutmeg for such a light pie: 1tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp ginger 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I also grated the fresh nutmeg over the top of the pie as the recipe directs but I found this to be too strong especially as nutmeg is rather bitter by itself and this isn't a very sweet pie. I will leave it off next time. Overall this pie was pretty good. I made two for a work party that had more than enough pumpkin pie and one of the pies disappeared entirely with only good things about it. I may try a recipe that uses evaporated milk next time to see how it compares. However since I had none on hand this time this recipe was perfect for me!",
