Although the instructions mention adding paprika to the top of the casserole, I added it, but I'm not really sure that it's necessary. Make sure to buy a big cauliflower because there is a lot of other stuff in the casserole. This could be assembled ahead of time and refrigerated, if that is more convenient. Thanks!",

I will remake it, but I will be making some changes next time. \n\nMy review for the recipe as it is written is middle of the road. My 7 year old son and I both liked it, but my mother did not care for it and my 5 year old daughter thought that being required to eat it was a fate worse than death. I did not like red peppers in this recipe because I found the sweetness off putting. The biggest thing about this recipe that I consider a fail is the corn flakes. Mixing them with sour cream and baking them in the casserole rendered them unrecognizable blobs of mush. What I liked best about this recipe is that it is a vegetable casserole where the veggies are the star of the show. I felt like 4 out of 5 vegetable casserole recipes were calling for a can of condensed soup, and I am all set with that.\n\nNext time, I'm going to begin by using green peppers and half a minced onion and sauteeing them in bacon grease before adding them to the casserole. I will also roast the cauliflower florets instead of steaming them. I will use 8oz of sour cream and 8oz of greek yogurt mixed with the sharp cheddar, and I will skip the corn flakes. Instead of just the parm on the top, I will mix the parm with the corn flakes and some crumbled bacon.",

I didn't have everything on hand to make this, so I had to omit and substitute a few items.  It came out very tasty with my substitutions.  I didn't have corn flakes, so I omitted the bread aspect.  I didn't have sour cream, but I did have plain yogurt, that I used in place of the sour cream.  I also only had a red bell pepper.  I saut\u00e9ed and added 1/2 cup chopped yellow onion and 3 large minced cloves of garlic  to the 1/2 cup of chopped red bell pepper in olive oil with 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper for several minutes and then added these saut\u00e9ed vegetables to the cauliflower and then mixed in the cheddar cheese and yogurt.  I didn't add salt since the cheeses have so much salt in them already.  I will make this again.",

I felt really skeptical for a moment before I tossed the cauliflower in with the other ingredients -- I felt that it would be too little to coat everything. However, it was the perfect amount. Each bite was cheesy and delicious. As for the corn flakes, I figured that I would crush them in a plastic baggie. Little did I know in advance that a snack-sized bag filled with corn flakes crunches down to exactly half a cup! Now you do, and you can save yourself a bit of time measuring! :)",
