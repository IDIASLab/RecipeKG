Everyone from my 5-year-old to my wife and I can't get enough, especially on a cold or grey day. This recipe generally makes enough for us to have two meals for five people with some lunches left over. Serve with condiments including crushed red pepper flakes, Parmesan cheese, and lime wedges.",

We've been making it since then about 3-4 times per year, and it is one of the top three meals we make at home - seriously.  The recipe as stated is perfect!  Just a couple hints and opinions:\n\n- We like to sub 1 napa cabbage in place of 1 bok choy.  It adds color, texture and bit of different leafy flavor.  We originally did this when the grocery only had 2 bok choy, so I've done it this way about half the time.\n\n- Use very good quality pork shoulder!\n\n- Use block parmesan to shred it yourself.\n\n- It makes a lot. If you have leftovers after a few days don't be afraid to freeze the rest of the soup (not the rice noodles).\n\n- This is a year-round soup!\n\nI've joked for years about opening a food cart for just yaka mein.  It may happen one day.",

I was hesitant to add Parmesan and lime together for the garnish but we gave it a shot and with the soup and that combined it make a nice symphony. Will be making this again!! Only problem is my opinion in wanting more veggies like onion mushroom or even garlic. So I will deff. Add that next time.",
