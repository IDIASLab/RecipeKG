If you don't have red chile powder (from an Indian grocery store) you can sub cayenne pepper. If you don't have ginger garlic paste just use equal parts fresh ginger & garlic and mash it up. After I add the water I cover the pot to allow the vegetables to steam. I check it occasionally stir and add more water as needed. Once the vegetables are cooked I open the lid to let the water cook off. Cabbage takes a while. You can also use cauliflower & potato (instead of cabbage & potato). You don't want too much potato in there. I use 1-2 small ones. One last note - I serve this with jeera rice and/or pita bread. To make jeera rice - Heat about 1 Tbsp oil in a pan. When hot add 1/2 tsp cumin seeds fry for a minute. Add 1 cup of basmati rice. Stir to coat and let it fry for a minute or 2. Add 2 cups of water and 1/2 tsp salt. When the water boils cut it down to low and cook covered for 15-20 minutes. Enjoy! This is traditionally served with dahl (lentils) for protein.",
