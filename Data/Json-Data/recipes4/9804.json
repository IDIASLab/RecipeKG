I use 2 cups of chicken broth, use a 28 oz can of tomatoes, omit celery (don't like) and use frozen corn and green beens as well as the fresh carrots.  Sometimes I also saute a large onion in the bottom of the pot and then add everything else.  I also use the Spicy V8.  The creole seasoning really makes it - but I also add at least 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper for some kick.  If you love your veggies, then you will LOVE this soup!!!  Thanks!!",

I used vegetable broth and V8, doubled the amount of these and omitted the water. \n\n For veggies I used carrots, red potatoes, celery, fresh roma tomatoes, fresh green beans, one can of peas, and before I added anything to the pot I also sauteed a medium onion and two cloves of garlic in 1/4 cup of olive oil, based on suggestions from other reviewers.  \n\nFor spices I used cajun spice instead of creole (it was all I had), a bay leaf, oregano, garlic powder, a couple pinches of ginger, sea salt, and fresh ground black pepper.  I also chopped up about a tablespoon of fresh flat-leaf parsley and put that in.  I definitely see this soup in my future.  Thanks so much for the recipe!",

I will simmer the soup for at least an hour so that the celery softens more.  I live on my own so I am constantly looking for recipes that are both healthy and economical.
