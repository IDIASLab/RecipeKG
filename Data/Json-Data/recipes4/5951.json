Both were delicious, moist, and provided hearty, filling meals for my family. Precisely following the recipe is essential. Do not use quick-cooking rice. It will alter the texture of the final product. Maybe that accounts for the \"mussy\" rice in another review. Dried cranberries, as specified in the recipe, absorb some of the cooking liquid but remain intact adding delicious, tart dimension to the dish. Canned or fresh cranberries probably break apart and add excess liquid so are not good substitutes. Pears instead of apples? I'm not sure that's a reasonable substitute either. Additional cooking liquid (broth) certainly won't enhance the recipe and could explain the reviewer's \"unedible\" rice mixture.",

I seasoned the pork loin with salt & pepper, and then browned it on all sides,(5 minutes per side), in Olive Oil over medium high heat.  While the meat was browning,I combined the apples,  (skin on), onions, craisins, salt, & pepper in the bottom of the crock pot.  When the pork finished browning, I squished the apple, cranberry, onion mixture to the sides of the crock pot, and laid the pork loin in the middle so it was touching the bottom of the crock pot.  I was worried about it being to dry, so I added a cup of chicken stock.  I sprinkled the Herbs de Provence over everything and let it cook on high for 6 hours.  I made the rice separately in my rice cooker, and when the pork was finished cooking, I used a slotted spoon to get the apple, cranberry, onion mixture out.  I mixed that in with the cooked rice.  It came out wonderful!  I will definitely make it again.",

Super tender and juicy but the rest of the stuff was unedible. I ended up dumping out the rest.
