Instead of tossing the squash in with the mushrooms I just roasted butternut squash cubes with olive oil, salt & pepper at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes.   I also used a blend of spinach and arugula.  I used cranberry and orange goat cheese and it gave a great sweetness to the salad.   I think this would be great with dried cranberries added also.   I served with a light dijon vinaigrette sweetened with a touch of honey.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will be making this over and over again.",

I didn't use mushrooms or pine nuts because I don't like them and I've used spinach in place of or combined with the arugula. I've taken it to pot luck type dinners and it's very easy to assemble on site. I can even cook the butternut squash and bacon a couple days before then zap it in the microwave and top the greens as directed when you're ready to serve.",
