Next time I think I would add more veggies - maybe some celery, red pepper and mushrooms. You could add another breast, but it did seem to have plenty of meat. I don't think I'd name this honey mustard as those flavors were overpowered by the soy sauce - I think I might try cutting the soy sauce in half in hopes the honey mustard flavor would be more noticable.",

I didn't have any 9\" pie crusts on hand, but I did have a bunch of 8\" crusts, so I scaled the recipe by 1.5 in order to fill two crusts.  I was hoping to have some left to freeze or to serve tomorrow, but that's not looking too likely at this point.  Other than the scaling, I followed the recipe to the letter (since there was no time given for marinating the chicken, I just left it in a zippered bag overnight).  I served it with mashed potatoes, which made a really nice accompaniment for it.  I will definitely be making this again.",

I agree with others that it could have used a little more filling- next time I'll use two cups of frozen veggies instead of one.
