It occurred to me the sweet red peppers would be mush if in the oven for an hour. So I put the sausage potatoes and onions in I also misread Italian seasoning and thought Italian dressing so painted the potatoes with a small amount of dressing after pouring chicken broth. It was tasty! I have on hand bouillon cubes so that is what I generally use. After things cooked a half hour I put the peppers in all smelled pretty good. In last 5-10 minutes I moved everything over in the casserole pan (there was a lot of liquid) then put in shredded chicken breasts. The liquid made chicken taste AMAZING as it sopped up a lot of liquid. Italian hot sausage I think made all the difference. I could have waited 40-45 minutes before adding the peppers next time I ll wait also to add onions. Some of the potatoes were totally cooked some potatoes were a little crunchy. Adding 15-20 more baking minutes will add to the potatoes getting totally cooked. I might think about adding carrots too to put in maybe the first 20 minutes cooking. My husband ate more of this than 90% of what I fix him. It also looked pretty good accept for shredded chicken next time I ll take pictures it was surprisingly good.",
