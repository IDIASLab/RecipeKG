Should only be a few Tbsps not a cup. Powdered sugar glaze is normally white and I have always made mine with a few tablespoons of milk. It should be thick enough that it just comes off the spoon. If you just want something sweet to soak into a cake that is colorless this is it. Thanks anyway but I won't make this again.",
