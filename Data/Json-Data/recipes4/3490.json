You may think the syrup sounds like more trouble than you want to go to but it really cooks itself while you are making the French toast - and is well worth it. I love the idea of this toast and can see making it with all kinds of fruit fillings. The syrup is just plain excellent. I made this as written using Merlot for the red wine. Great recipe - thanks!:)",
