But next time I make it I'll be sure to upgrade to what's called for in the original. I loved the unusual approach of cooking the ditalini with the asparagus and then adding the egg mixture to the hot pasta... I thought the whole thing was easy and tasted FANTASTIC!! This will become a regular in my collection - thanks!!",
