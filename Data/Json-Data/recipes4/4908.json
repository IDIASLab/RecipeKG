I brown the chicken in the skillet cover with foil and finish it in the oven so I have time to caramelize the onions. I don't fully caramelize them as that would take a while to do but I cook them for a lot longer than \"soft and translucent\" to get more flavor from them. They should be pretty mushy. We also like the dish a bit more garlic-y now so I add a good bit of garlic powder to the cream sauce as it is thickening. Thanks for trying this recipe! I hope this info is helpful:)",

I did follow your directions on putting the chicken into the oven after browning (I used a combo of butter and olive oil) while finishing the onions. When I fixed the onions I added the garlic too soon so use caution because you do not want burned garlic. I used a little more butter for the onions too to help with the caramelizing. I was lucky to be making this dish when Vidalias are in season--they are so good. When I went to make the sauce it just called out to me to add something so I used a little garlic powder and a few sprinkles of tarragon. I made the sauce a little more in bulk for the meal we were having so that I could pour some over some capellini. Yum! We have some leftovers for another night! Thanks Meghann!",
