I highly recommend carmelizing the onion and also leaving the squash al dente instead of mushy.  I also used the whole egg.  I didn't have a \"sleeve\" of Ritz crackers so I had to estimate with club crackers.  Since I had used a whole egg, I used enough cracker crumbs to make the whole thing come together.  I also used Cheddar cheese with black pepper which made the whole thing spicier.  I really enjoyed this recipe and will make again. Thanks!",

I sliced the squash and onions in the food processor and then placed in my microwavable rice/vegetable steamer and microwaved on high for 10 minutes.

I added 1/2 of the crackers to the filling and 1/2 were sprinkled on top along with part of the cheese. Beautiful golden color was achieved after 25 minutes.
