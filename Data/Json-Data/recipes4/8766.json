I made a pound of penne I used only sweet italian sausage (though I think it would be great with the combo too). I used an entire onion. The sun-dried tomatoes that I used said packed with olive oil and HERBS as well as my diced canned tomatoes so I did not need to add any additional italian herbs. I drained most of the liquid out of the tomatoes (recipes doesn't indicate either way) and I skipped the cherry tomatoes. Because I skipped the cherry tomatoes I cut back a bit on the cream so the sauce wouldn't be too thin. I think next time I will simmer the sauce a little longer before adding the cream because my husband felt the sun-dried tomatoes were still a little firm. I will definitely make this one again.",

I have to say both ways were great. To the vegan version I added celery and carrots to saute along with the onions and garlic. Thank you Wallace Clan for posting this versital recipe!",
