It's hard to cook great meals with venison without going the extra mile to get some of the gamey flavor out. I added potatos and carrots. Had to use a cup of water,a full 15 oz can of tomato sauce and only used one lb of venison. The tomato gravy turned out excellent in thickness. Like a lot of my tomato based stews, I added 1/4 cup ketchup,a tbsp of worcestershire and two tsp of bacon grease. Wow, delicious! This is a keeper. I challenge anyone to try this.",

As often happens, some bites were tender and others were chewy and dry.  I used a cut labeled by my hunter as \"hind roast.\"  I'd be interested to know what cut of meat others used.  In my opinion, the gaminess that some people complain of is due to the age of the animal or perhaps not butchering promptly.  The meat my hunter provides always has a pleasant flavor.",

A dash of A-1 Sauce really kicks it up a knotch:)",

After looking at the recipe again I've noticed that I forgot to add the parsley even though I have some growing in my house! LOL I think that would have added even more flavor. Like others here I added potatoes and carrots with the other ingredients and cut the venison down to 1 pound. I didn't have tomato sauce basil or oregano so I substituted 1 small can each of pizza sauce and V-8. I cooked the stew overnight for about 8 hours on low but the vegetables weren't quite done when I checked it in the morning so I turned the slow cooker on high and cooked the stew for about 2 more hours. At the very end I added 1 cup of frozen peas. It is an excellent flavorful stew and I recommend the recipe to anyone who is cooking with venison.",
