I was looking for a good wing recipe (Very tired of the restaurant wings) these had the most wonderful flavor!! I baked them as directed the only change I made was to brush some of them with Sweet baby Ray's kickin bourbon wing sauce and glaze. which was pretty darned good. but if I hadn't used this marinade on them first it would have been pretty darned blawzay! I will use this from now on. Best tasting wing I have had in YEARS even hubby loved them. Thank you so much for this GREAT recipe!!",

I used Louisiana Gem Habanero Pepper Sauce for the hot pepper sauce and Trader Joe's organic unfiltered Apple Cider Vinegar. I also bought a fresh brand new can of Crisco shortening. Make sure you have the large bowls baking sheet (I used a jelly roll pan) skillet paper towel-lined platter and serving dish out and ready because things happen fast towards the end. I had them marinate in the fridge overnight. I have two more pounds of wings in my Costco bag of frozen wings and I will make another batch using this same recipe. Perfect amount of heat and so delicious! Didn't feel the heat on my lips until I was done;-) Thanks Jeri!!!",
