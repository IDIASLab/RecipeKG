First I used regular linguini pasta instead of whole wheat rotini.  I used 1 (10 oz) container of Buitoni regular alfredo sauce and 1 (10 oz) container of Buitoni light alfredo sauce  from the cold case at the grocery store. I have used the jarred varieties of alfredo sauce before and have never been satisfied with the taste of any of them so I thought I would try the more fresh version. I personally think that it was hands down much better than the jarred. I upped the milk to 3/4 cup intead of 1/2 and used 16 ozs of pasta.   Then I used Kraft 2% Colby Jack Monterey but used 2 cups so it was a little cheesier.  I found the recipe easy to follow and quick to put together. Definetely a keeper. In the future I will make it with shrimp or chicken as well as the ham. Thanks for sharing the recipe mrs. embee.",

Italian seasoning; I used a 12oz bag of microwave in the bag Broccoli. I also didn't bake it, I just threw all the cooked items in a pot!",

I will keep this one and maybe try leftover chicken next time.  Thank you mrsembee!!",

The reason for only 2 stars is the use of jarred Alfredo sauce. Take a look at the chemical ingredients on the jar and then go home and make your own!! It is easy and you can pronounce all the ingredients. A good rule when choosing a food product is if you would not ever have the ingredients on your pantry shelf don't buy the product. Food companies are beginning to get the message. PS: Of course don't include the listed vitamins in the group of taboo ingredients.",
