Also I was running low on tumeric so I only used a teaspoon but that seemed fine for us and still gave the rice a bright beautiful color. Lastly 1 cup of water to 1 cup of rice is off if you are using regular white rice so just follow the liquid to rice ratio on the back of the rice package to ensure proper cooking. We enjoyed the flavors in this and it was so easy to make...I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
