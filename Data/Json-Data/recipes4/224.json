I used a regular skillet and then flipped the ingredients into a pie dish added the cheese and baked about 15-20 minutes at 325 degress. It was a hit with everyone! I have had weight loss surgery and some foods are hard for me to eat this sat very well with me... The only thing I would do different is make the CUBE size of the potatoes SMALL... I did mine med to large because the recipe did not really say! Next time instead of ham I think I might try adding Carne Adavoda (pork cooked in red chili)! Yummy!",

I slid it out of the frying pan onto a round pizza pan and cut it with a pizza cutter. It was easy enough to make tasted very good and since there are only two of us there's enough left for tomorrow.

It very quickly became our \"go to\" for Sunday morning brunch after we get home from church. We have done this recipe many many times trying different combinations of ingredients. We've found that the cooking times are very accurate but we make sure to test it not trust it when pulling it out of the oven. Prep time takes a little bit longer. End to end it takes us about 45 minutes. This last time we made it was the best...first we cooked Jimmy Dean ground sausage in the skillet. No oil. When cooked used a slotted spoon to take it out and leave behind the grease. We used the grease instead of the oil which actually caused the onions to caramelize on the bottom...woah was that amazing!! We slice the potatoes to cook and then lay them on top of the onions after they have been saut\u00e9ed. Threw the sausage on top of the potatoes then poured the eggs on top. Literally - 5 minutes on the stove...no more. Add sliced tomatoes on top before popping them in the oven for everything to finish cooking. Fabulous!! Thank you Jody!!!!",
