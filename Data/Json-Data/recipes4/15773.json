I didn't have a ham bone, but was looking for a way to use up some ham that had been in the freezer, and decided to try your recipe with the slight modification of using 3 cups of chopped ham instead of the ham bone.  I've always been a little scared of making lentil soup, I don't know why, I guess I always wondered if I could get full bodied, rich tasting soup instead of the thin stuff.  This was perfect, perfect, perfect!!  It's sitting on the stove now, cooling, and once it's cool enough, I'll probably refrigerate it overnight, and it will probably be even better!  I actually let it simmer for 30+ minutes -- only because I love simmering soup on the stove and letting the aroma fill the house!  If anyone is thinking of leaving out the marjoram, DON'T DO IT!  It is the perfect flavoring for ham soups.  Also be sure to skim off any of the foam that's created by simmering.  Next time I'll use a ham bone, but even so, I now know there's a lentil soup out there that I can make (and freeze!) with just the ham.  Thank you Leslie!",

I didn't have any bullion or a spare hambone laying around, so, I used canned chicken broth (2 cans, + some water) substituted a bit of prepackaged thick-sliced ham; I also sauteed the veggies and chopped ham in a bit of butter before adding the broth and lentils. The marjoram and bell pepper really give it a good kick. Thanks Leslie! Happy to add this to my collection!",
