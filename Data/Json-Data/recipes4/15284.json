The olives added a nice salty element into the dish but I think they need to be very finely chopped and perhaps a whole cup is too overpowering. Either way this is a keeper. Great way to get some fennel into the rotation such a delicious veg and so underused! Thanks for sharing Chris Denzer",

The only sausage I had was hot Premio sausage so used it instead of sweet. Still came out very tasty and we ate it all nothing left to take picture. Next time I will make exactly to taste difference between sweet and hot sausage dish.",
