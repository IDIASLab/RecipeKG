I've been making a version of this for years with excellent results.\nYou don't have to stick to just chocolate either - this will work with any \"chip\" flavor you have. Today I made peanut butter and dark chocolate, and I was about to make a pan of white chocolate when disaster struck and I dropped my last can of condensed milk on the floor. Bummer. That must have been the Universe intervening to save my poor thighs! \nIf you want this to feel extra fancy, use a higher quality chocolate chip, like Ghiradelli to give a better depth of flavor. You can also top with chopped nuts, festive candies or sprinkles, or some unmelted chocolate chips. Get creative.\nProTip: Skip the step where you grease the pan. Just line with a single piece of aluminum foil instead (grease it with cooking spray if you want this to be extra simple.) and when it's time to serve the fudge, just lift the entire thing out of the pan, peel off the foil and cut into squares. Voila! Clean up is easier now too. \nI skip the 1 oz square and just use extra chips.\nRemember to work quickly once you've removed your mixture from the microwave. It's going to thicken up & get ooey-gooey very fast, so you need to get it smooth & spread it into the pan immediately. \nThe last thing I've found is that this fudge does best when kept in the fridge.",
