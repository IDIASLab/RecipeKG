I have been making it since I was a teenager, and everyone in the family always requests it when I make dinner.  I have shortened the prep time using canned, whole, white potatoes, instead of boiling my own.  The results are just as delicious. If you are opposed to canned potatoes, use fresh, boiled potatoes.  These potatoes make fantastic leftovers too!  This is the first time I have ever given out the recipe.  I hope you all enjoy it as much as we do!",

I did not have canned potatoes so I cubed about 8 small to medium sized red potatoes and boiled in water on the stove top about 8-10 minutes.  While potatoes were cooking, I caramelized the onions with the EVOO and also added 1 tablesoon of honey (was out of agave) to add more flavor.  Drained potatoes and added remaining ingredients.  Totally forgot to add the 1/2 stick of room temperature butter on top of potatoes! This dish really did not need the added butter (or calories) because it really has a good flavor with the paprika and caramelized onions.  I garnished with rosemary before serving.  Next time I may put some rosemary in this dish prior to baking.  I will make again. ",
