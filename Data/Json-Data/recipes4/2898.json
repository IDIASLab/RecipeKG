I chopped the chicken then mixed it with the dressing and topped the flatbread added the cheese and baked. My picky son even liked it (without the lettuce of course) I will do this again and will bake a little longer I liked the edges that got a little crispy! also did not have rosemary so I left it out. I WILL FIX THIS AGAIN and will try the pocket thing too maybe? idk? it was sooo yummy this way:) did the chicken exact and was surprise how moist it turned out.
