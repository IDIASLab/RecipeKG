A simple white sauce where you add cheese and a few other flavors with macaroni and a potato chip crust.  This recipe makes a lot, I like to make two pans so I can take one to a pot luck and have the other one to keep in the fridge for later. It's an easy recipe to adjust down if you only want to make one pan. If you aren't cooking it right away, just keep the topping separate until you are ready to put it in the oven.",

I cooked the pasta all the way and only put it in the oven for 10 minutes for the cheese to melt and the crackers to brown.",

I also added boneless chicken breast and shrimp, yes, at the same time. It is really delicious. \n\nI used boneless chicken breast that I boiled in water. Then I placed them on a cutting board and used a masher (like for potatoes) to mash and \"shred\" them. Set aside.\n\nThen I used raw (uncooked) shrimp and peel them completely, including tails. Shrimp size is up to you. \n\nMix in the chicken and shrimp (raw) when you combine the macaroni and cheese sauce. The shrimp will cook in the oven. Enjoy, it is an impressive meal!!",

I believe Mac N Cheese needs to have a sharp cheddar bite, even if it's only like Stouffers.  I would try to use all sharp cheddar, maybe add Parmesan or Asiago and lose the milk or most of it but consider using the liquid from the boiled pasta.  Lastly, the potato chip topping was good but you'd better eat all of it right out of the oven.  If you don't and then put the leftovers covered in the fridge for a day and then reheat.  I thought twice about this too when first making this recipe.  Have you ever put a potato chip in the refrigerator and eaten it the next day?  Not good.",

It gives more flavor, bite to the cheese. American is fine, and Parmesan adds a nice zip. The seasonings, as stated, are a MUST! Especially the mustard powder. Without the correct seasonings, this recipe would be bland...so please use the seasonings and taste as you go to see if more is required. Also, if it still turns out bland, then your seasonings are too old!! Buy new spices at least every year!",
