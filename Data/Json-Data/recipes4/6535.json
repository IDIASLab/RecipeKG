It was perfect--I can't imagine that it would have been any better with heavy cream.  I also added a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes.  Oh, yes, and I didn't layer it: I saut\u00e9ed the vegetables, made the sauce, and added the cooked chicken and pasta--all in the same oven safe pan--topped it with the cheeses, and baked it.  Wonderful dinner, super easy clean-up.",

Yes, it was O.K., smelled wonderful when cooking, but the final product just didn't live up to my expectations, just a bit bland..  Not bad, but not outstanding either.  Please don't let me discourage you from trying this recipe because we all have different tastes, and I did rate it at 4 stars.",
