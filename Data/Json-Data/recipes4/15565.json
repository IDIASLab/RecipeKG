I didn't make any sauce to go with it but drizzled cream over it instead. (Maybe that's weird? I don't know. We liked it.) My husband and two young kids both loved it including the one who won't eat figs. The only part I wasn't sure about was the orange peel strips. It seemed strange to leave them in there. But again I'd never had it before so I don't know.",
