I followed the suggestion and doubled the spices but didn't change anything else. \r\nI was worried that it wouldn't have much flavour as the smell wasn't that strong, and before it finished cooking it was a little on the bland side. I resisted the urge to add more spices and it proved to be the right decision. \r\n\r\nThanks for the great recipe.",

Of couse he said he thought it would be great with beef stew meat. :) I think lamb would be a good choice. We did eat this meatless, but I did sprinkle a small bit of good fresh goat cheese on top. Yum.   The house smelled wonderful while cooking this. I would suggest cutting the potatoes rather small so that they get nice and soft. I cut mine in larger cubes and had to cook this an additional 45 minutes and they were still rather hard.  Overall, this was good, and the hubby requests it again.",

It made a GREAT sauce:) I also added some pumpkin in place of about half the potatoes and ate it with brown basmati rice. I think a squirt of lime juice at the end would've be a nice touch... if I had a lime;) This seems to be one of those things that gets better the longer you cooked it... i cooked mine for a little over an hour. So good! Thanks for posting it!",
