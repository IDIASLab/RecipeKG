I love to make extra and freeze them individually wrapped for E-Z lunch. Just wrap in papaer towel and microwave for 1.5 min and lunch is served. Kids love it with ranch for dip I prefer hot mustard. Instead of frozen bread loafs I use frozen dinner roll balls. It seems better for my little counter space. I also sometimes use McCorrimic's hamburger spice or tastefully simple's garlic garlic. Chopped bacon is also a great addition to this lovely pocket.",

After the first batch I gave up and dumped the remainder of the filling in 13X9 dish layered the cheese slices on top of that then rolled out the second loaf of bread to cover the top. Baked for about 20-25 minutes until the bread was done. Much easier. Just bought a bag of cole slaw mix from produce section and used half of it instead of having to chop up a head of cabbage. I d use sharp cheddar next time if I make this again so that I can actually taste the cheese. Mild cheddar seems to loose its taste when cooked into a dish. Also add some garlic and Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture.",

The onion soup mix is new while some add Italian sausage cheese a variety of seasonings etc to the ground beef I use ground turkey myself(cheaper). Their recipe is quite simple ground meat onion cabbage salt and pepper. There seems to be some other seasoning Runza uses some say white pepper is better than black. They also use sugar in their dough mixture. To shorten preparation time I substitute sauerkraut instead of cooking the cabbage down for 1/2 to 3/4 of an hour you can use the refrigerated dough to save time and labor too. You then fill the center of the dough the with cooked mixture and fold and seal the Runza in any shape you like and bake until brown. I roll my dough out in a circle and fold it it looks more like a calzone I brown mine on both sides baste with melted butter and enjoy! This is an old recipe brought over to the U.S. with the \"Germans from Russia\" in the 1800's. If you want you can \"Google\" the \"Runza\" recipe. L.D. Lincoln Ne.",
