I have altered it a little to our tastes we like it spicy! First I hate jiffy (too sweet) so I can find a Texas Style brand bag at my WalMart but any of the other 6oz bags work. I use 3 or 4 because I make it in a 13\"x9\" pan (my hubby likes LOTS of leftovers for work). So i had to tweak the cornbread/water/cream style corn ratio. You don't want to much tho or the cornbread is too overpowering. I use spicy sausage lots of pepper jack cheese mexican style cornbread in a bag and as many jalapenos to completely cover. I do have to bake longer than specified depending on what part of the country I'm in its anywhere from 10-25 min longer! Check it every 8 min after the time it should be done. If people are scared of spicy leave off the jalapenos on half. I serve with sour cream a lil extra sprinkled cheese and a cold beer to extinguish the burn!",
