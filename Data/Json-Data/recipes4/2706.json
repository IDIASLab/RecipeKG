However, just by reading the ingredients I could tell they would be bland so I added some spices to my preference like garlic powder, onion powder, salt and Pepper to the pasta.  Because my true favorite recipe for Mac & cheese has cottage cheese and Parmesan cheese in it, I thought I'd add them too!  I am glad I did.  So, I can't really rate this recipe as written because I tweaked it too much, but baking them in the muffin pan is a brilliant idea and it went over well with my daughter who only likes the boxed process kind...untill now!  thanks.",

More than enough for a couple lunches or dinner warmups.\n\nMy son was impressed with handheld macaroni and cheese. I'll make this again for another special occasion.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: My family at all 16 mac and cheese muffins. This was a huge hit.\nThink about making it my way. You'll thank me.",

Makes lovely individually sized servings and you really can't find anything more simplistic than this.  I froze them and have found they make perfect lunch time treats.  As for the mac itself, I admit that I doctored it up quite a bit to make it better.  Add black pepper, more cheese and even a dash of garlic powder.  I also added some sour cream to the noodle mixture and it comes out tasting creamy and delicious.  Thank you for the recipe.",

My husband and I did a few test runs before the big event, just to work out any kinks.  We finalized the recipe by using 3 cups of sharp cheddar (instead of the 1.5 cups) and adding an extra 1/2 cup of milk (total of 1.5 cups of milk used), because we thought they were a little dry and bland with the basic recipe.  I also added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika to the mixture before putting it into the cupcake pan.  To get the best results, we used foil cupcake liners, so they came out easily and were a little more individualized for our guests.  They came out amazing, and were a huge hit with everyone!  The were gooey and had great cheesy flavor!  My mom (who is known for her baked mac and cheese) asked me for the recipe for Thanksgiving!  Thanks for the fun twist on a classic family dish!  :)",

I followed the recipe without any change. On the positive side it was creamy yet kept a good muffin form. Next time I will lessen the salt in the crumb topping and maybe add a little salt in the mac mixture instead. This was such a fun food! Thank you. EDIT: I'm back to add an afterthought. I heated these up the next day and I have to say they reheat very well. They weren't bland the next day. It seems to be that this is a great \"make-ahead\" meal. Delicious!",
