I sauteed red pepper, pea pods and green onion in a little sesame oil to crisp-tender before adding at the end.  Also, chunky pb did the trick and I didn't need additional peanuts.   I think I will reduce the ginger to 1 TBSP next time.  I didn't use chicken...marinated tofu would be great in this, though.",

To save time I doubled the peanut butter (crunchy natural peanut butter from the health shop) and left out the peanuts at the end as recommended by some reviewers. 2 handfuls of snow peas rinsed in boiling water and cut into strips make a delicious addition. If you don't have a roast chicken use 4 chicken breasts - fry in the pan before making the sauce remove slice and add at the end.",

I boiled the breast than shredded... taste great. I do not like honey so I left that out. I didn't have red peppers which I think if I did this recipe might have been 5 stars. I added carrots which turned out good. If I make this again I will add carrots along with the red bell pepper. I only had dried cilantro which I couldn't even taste so next time I will make sure to have fresh cilantro. I had hot chili oil which gave it a nice kick.
