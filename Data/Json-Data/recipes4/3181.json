Sauted some onion and added that with the bacon. I used Monteray Jack cheese on top. I used a pizza stone that had already heated and broiled it for about 7 minutes. I thought it was okay but my SO loved it. Next time I would not use the olive oil - it made the potatoes hard to spread over the crust. Also I'd use a little more cheese.
