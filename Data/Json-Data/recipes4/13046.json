I made the mini balls and put canned salmon bits and spiced ginger in the center. I rolled them in black and white seseme seeds and put dried seaweed on others. The teens at the school loved them. I found great directions in the internet for rolling and twisting them in wet salted plastic wrap which took all the air out and made them nice and firm. (then take them out of the plastic wrap)The key is to always handle them with wet hands.",

I came across this recipe after watching Fruits Basket with a friend and we decided it would be perfect. Made the first few rice balls using the recipe as-is, though we couldn't find bonito flakes, so we used some tuna salad, chicken salad and avocado instead. After making some of the plain rice ones, we elyssa's advice and added some rice vinegar, sugar and salt to the rice. The smell kind of scared us at first, but after tasting them, we were glad we did it! Both versions of the recipe get five stars from everyone at the party!",

But, my mom puts soy sauce on the flakes first.   It kind of melts down, but makes it easier to put in the middle and gives a nice salty kick.   I can't imagine eating just plain flakes with out the soy on it.  I've never seen it anywhere without the soy and bonito inside.  Try some flaked salmon with soy also.  That is how I've always seen it or bought in Japan.  Also, most of the time she puts msg (or accent) on the outside or gives it a quick shake into the batch when shaping them.  Actually, every one on my japanese side does it.  I don't think that they has much of a problem with msg as they do here.",

I prefer Avocado or tuna salad in mine most of the time. Salmon is good as mentioned though as well. These are very cheap lunches and are the Japanese equivalent of a Sandwich culturally from what I understand. Very tasty! I always have a few in my fridge for a quick snack also.",
