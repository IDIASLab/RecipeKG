The quantity of the vinegar is so small that it doesn't seem to really help the flavor it was instead lost-next time I will cut out the water and use all champagne vinegar instead. I think sweet onion would be a nice addition to the flavors too. Update: This is just fabulous with the addition of a little minced red onion and by omitting the sugar.",
