I chose a lean chuck roast and followed the recipe exactly only the pepperoni I could only find in a three ounce package which worked out great. I served it over baked potatoes like a loaded baked potato with steamed corn on the side. The juices from the roast made the potato delicious! Highly recommend this recipe as a nice change to your usual pot roast recipe. Also great recipe for chicken. I use frozen \"grilled and ready\" breasts and we love the sauce mixed with fluffy white rice as a side dish. Very versatile recipe.",
