Also I only did 1tb of salt rather than an additional salt seasoning and net time I will go half on the garlic powder. as it does taste a little salty. Made mine without the chile pepper bc I couldn't get to the store. And brown rice on the side. also u could do all water instead of oil if you want something more diet refined.",
