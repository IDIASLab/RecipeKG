Had the oven bags on hand and decided to try it.  Think it would be fine with just one pkg of onion soup mix. I did add an extra 1/4 cup of water. Put in potatoes, carrots and another whole yellow onion with the vegies.  I don't make pot roast because usually mine has come out dry and chewy in the past.  Now it will be a go to recipe.",

Sodium in it is 600+ mg...and you're getting enough sodium in the beef consomme and Worcestershire sauce. SO, suggest adding more onion, garlic, paprika, pepper to the mix for taste.   I also added about a teaspoon of natural raw sugar in with the Worcestershire/beef consomme/water mix (as it is the only thing I saw on the onion mix bag that was missing in this recipe). I also added red potatoes to the bag, and took the the cooking time (when veggies/potatoes added) to an hour, instead of 45 minutes.\n\nThe short of it is the family loved it. My wife said this tasted like her grandmother's roast. It came out GREAT!",
