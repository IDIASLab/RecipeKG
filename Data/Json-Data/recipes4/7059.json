I made the following changes and the cookies came out great: 3 cups total flour (I used a mixture of 2 cups milo/amaranth/chia and 1 cup tapioca) kept the baking soda at 1/2 tsp and 1/2 tsp salt added 1 Tbsp of cornstarch 1/2 cup coconut oil melted 2 eggs (mix oil and egg together) 1/2 cup white sugar 3/4 cup brown sugar kept the vanilla and chocolate chips the same. Dropped by spoonfuls onto parchment paper. Baked them for 10 - 11 minutes. Let them set for 2-3 minutes then transferred them to a cooling rack. The cookies came out much like a regular cookie soft on the inside and a slight crunch on the outside. Wonderful.",

The first time I made them, I mixed the chocolate chips in with the batter.  This resulted in thick cookies that were slightly gummy.  The second time I made them, I rolled the cookies into approximately 1\u201d balls and flattened them with a fork much like you do when you make peanut butter cookies.  I then pushed chocolate chips into the top of the cookie.  These turned out great after 10 minutes bake time.",

They were a little dry so I added just enough water to moisten the cookie dough. I pushed them down a little instead of leaving them in a ball also I think that helped. They turned out super yummy!!",

First time my 13 yr old made it....waaaay too oily - the \"dough\" was spooned onto the cookie sheet because it could not be formed into a ball. It pooled into one huge sheet of bubbling goo as it baked. Sure it looked bad but to be fair I gave it a taste after it cooled. No good. Second try...I thought \"I bet the measurements were off a bit\" so I made it myself. Still super oily and there was no way this stuff could be rolled into any form. Cookies came out flat and oily. The taste and texture was unappealing. Next I added an entire cup of almond flour more that the recipe calls for. This time I was able to form very oily balls. They baked into a chocolate chip cookie shape this time but still didn't taste good. The 1/2 cup of oil called for in this recipe is just way too much. Not to mention the agave syrup - too sweet. This was a very expensive flop. My advice try a different gluten free recipe.",
