I basted at 2 hours but since the brisket was swimming in broth I didn't baste again. I did informal fork tests for tenderness at 6 and 8 hours and since I was getting pretty hungry took it out at 9 hours. I carved off about a third of the meat and let the rest cook for one more hour (the full 10). The meat was fairly tender enough to cut small pieces with the edge of a fork and not needing a knife. But I found the flavor kind of boring. I ate it all certainly - it just wasn't anything special. This was my first brisket of any kind and this recipe didn't make the meat shine. As a small bonus though the leftover broth made several bowlfuls of decent tasting soup as is. I probably won't make this recipe again though.",
