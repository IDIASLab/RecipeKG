Being that pork and sauerkraut is a New Year's Eve tradition I had to make this and boy was it good - not only for the ease of prep but for the taste. I didn't add the optional baby potatoes and used two bags of Boar's head sauerkraut. I also threw in a thin sliced Granny Smith apple and a little brown sugar (this takes away the tartness of the kraut). I made this before I went to bed New Year's Eve and it was done for New Year's day. Perfect with mashed potatoes and sweet peas!",

I wanted to use some apple to cut the sourness of the kraut, but not too much, and definitely not too much liquid, because the kraut, onions, apple & meat also release much juice as they cook. After reading many reviews from 4 similar recipes on this site I did the following: I seasoned a 4 pound boneless pork loin roast (with Stubb\u2019s all- natural pork spice rub, black pepper, garlic powder & a little salt) & seared all sides on the stove in a little oil. Transferred the meat to the slow cooker with the fat side up (do not add the oil\u2014it gets a burnt flavor with high smoke point searing) & added 1 large jar of all natural sauerkraut with juice, 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 2 bay leaves,  a sprinkling of caraway seeds, 10 whole juniper berries & 2 teaspoons dark brown sugar.  I then topped with 1/2 of a very large granny smith apple (peeled and sliced), 1 medium red onion (sliced) and 2 tablespoons butter (cut up into little chunks). Cooked for 6 hours at 250 degrees and it was so tender, juicy and flavorful & the kraut/onions tasted great. You can\u2019t taste the apple at all & the small amount of apple, brown sugar & butter cuts the sourness of the kraut juice. Served it with mashed potatoes on the side. My husband said he thought he'd died and gone to heaven, lol, it was that good! :)",
