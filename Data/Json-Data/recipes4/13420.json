Of necessity, I used soy sauce instead of Worcestershire and it was fine. I replaced the butter with olive oil also with no problems and less fat. Now the big change, I baked rather than grilled the chicken and used bone-in breasts which I think are juicier and are also more economical.  I lined a glass baking dish with foil for easy clean up.  I marinated the breasts for a full day, placed them in the dish, poured the marinade over the top, and sealed tightly with foil.  I baked them at 375 for 45 minutes, removed the foil and baked for another fifteen minutes. Once I removed the foil, I basted the breasts often.  After 15 minutes and when they tested as nearly done with a meat thermometer, I broiled them for about five minutes to brown and crisp the skin.  These were SO juice and SO tender that my husband couldn't stop raving about them.  And wow did they smell good!  Next time I may try them on the grill but baking works REALLY well.  This is definitely a keeper! I served them with couscous with fresh chopped tomatoes added  when I fluffed it. A big hit! ",

                "reviewBody": "Hubs and I both enjoyed this and I was surprised he did, given he is always against any kind of marinades (I did it while he was working before he had a chance to object). Personally, I prefer the way he generally grills chicken (I think it's his secret) but it was fun to try something different. I used olive oil rather than margarine and followed the rest of the marinade ingredients as directed. The flavors are all very mellow, and you wouldn't have guessed there was any hot sauce in the marinade at all, so if you like a little kick, I'd suggest adding more. The thing I wasn't crazy about, however, is the vinegar that is this marinade's signature - while I couldn't isolate any of the other ingredients in the marinade, the tang of the vinegar was unmistakable and a little too pronounced for me. If I were to make this again I'd substitute white wine. All and all, a perfectly okay marinade.",
