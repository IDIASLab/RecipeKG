The key is to make the dish, such as lasagna, ahead of time, and let it set in the fridge overnight.  It allows the tofu to \"soak up\" the flavors from the dish, and masks the \"tofu-y\" flavor.  When you're ready to serve, just reheat it in the oven.",

I did this for about 30-45 min prior to making this whole thing.  The key is to NOT HAVE excess water in your sauce mixture--that's what makes it runny people!  Anyhoo after I dried my tofu I eyballed my spices in a lg bowl, parsley, basil, italian seasoning, oregano, pinch of garlic salt, lemon pepper, grated parm cheese (I'd rather use the fresh one, but wanted more flavor in this mix--fresh added later), minced garlic and a smidge of olive oil.  Mashed that all together the good old fashioned way (with my fingers--plus my toddler helped) and made it look like the consistency of ricotta cheese--amazing.  Still used that Costco size Ragu parm sauce for this-dumped the entire jar in.  Think it could be just a wee bit saucier, so I have a sm jar to pop open for the leftovers. Other than that...GREAT EASY RECIPE.  Oh yeah and hubby loved it last time... didn't suspect a thing!  My new way of making lasagna.",

I took some of the other reviewer's advice and added fresh onions and garlic to my sauce as well as doubling the cheese and using a whole jar of sauce. Perfect! If you like your lasagna juicy and cheesy you must use more cheese and definitely a whole jar of sauce. I also used whole wheat lasagna instead of semolina fat free mozz cheese and fat free pasta sauce (no one was the wiser that's how good it was). Definitely freezes well which is great when you are cooking for 1. Next time will definitely add some spinach to the mix!",

First I sprayed my pan with PAM. In a large mixing bowl I added a block of firm tofu (dried off w/ paper towel) 2 eggs a couple gulgs of organic milk kosher salt italian seasoning garlic powder basil nutmeg blk pepper mozz cheese 3 cloves of fresh garlic chopped and 1/2 a jar of Bertolli olive oil and mushroom sauce. I smashed it all together for the ricotta consistency and then put this tofu mixture as my bottom layer. I had 3 layers of noodles. On my 1st layer I put some sauce from the jar and some cheese; then the tofu mixture then sauce/cheese. I never measure my spices. Just pour in a whole bunch cuz it tastes so good (or eyeball it as Rachel Ray would say)! Next time I may add some Boca ground meat sauteed in EVOO and garlic and add it as one of my layers. Spinach sounds good too. I bet my tofu-phobic husband will never know this lasagna was made with tofu! Thanks for the great recipe! UPDATE: I successfully tricked my husband. He LOVED the lasagna so I do not think I will ruin it for him by telling him about the tofu. One thing I would probably try differently next time is to use plain sauce (not the tofu/sauce mixture) for the bottom layer.",

I didn t use tofu but instead a meat substitute (Quorn Crumbles). It is a good recipe and my gf was surprised that it tasted so good.
