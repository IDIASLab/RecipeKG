HOWEVER you should cook the brown rice first preferably in the brothy liquid. He cooked the casserole an extra half hour and the rice still was crunchy. It makes me want to scratch my head: you cook everything else you put in this casserole why not the rice??",

Regular brown rice must cook for at 45 minutes with a cup of rice to 2 cups of liquid. This alone would make the recipe a 5 Star recipe. Knowing this I loved it but rated it based on the recipe as written not on my dish. Also agree that putting the cheese on the side would make for better leftovers. Thanks for posting an excellent recipe. I would suggest changing the rice to say instant brown or showing it as cooked brown rice. But it is worth the work.",
