I noticed that the weight per package was very different but substituted  it \u2018 box per box\u2019 for the recipe. Well it turns out the weight is different because a significant portion of the Royal is artificial sweetener instead of sugar. You can really taste that artificial flavor the way this recipe concentrates it. Several people got napkins and discarded the jigglers that they had popped in their mouths at the event this was for. So CHECK the ingredients on whatever brand gelatin you buy and know it makes a difference.",
