Instead, I wisked together one cup of fat free sour cream and 1 cup of skim milk.  It made it very creamy, without the heaviness of the cream.  Plus, the sour cream gave it a really nice flavor.  I also used minced garlic instead of sliced garlice.  It was absolutely delicious!",

I used my mandolin to slice the potatoes very thin, so the cooking time was precise.  What a wonderful recipe!  *Update*:  I've found that if you cover with foil for the first half hour (spray the underside of the foil with cooking spray and it won't stick to the cheese) the potatoes cook more thoroughly.  Just a little tip.  Still making this awesome recipe!!!",

Very good I only changed this a little I crushed the garlic and added it to the cream (I tripled the recipe and wanted the garlic to be even through the potatoes) I also added finely chopped onion like another reviewer. Go easy with the salt with all this cheese especially with the parmesan. I will be making this for Easter dinner this Sunday to go with the ham. I find that if I par boil the potatoes (cover potatoes with water and bring to a boil for a couple of minutes) then slice they cook faster and the sauce is creamier I think because the potatoes don't absorb to much of the moisture maybe that just me.",

Based on the recommendations of other reviewers I sliced the potatoes thinly using my Kitchen Aid slicer I used a mixture of 1 c. fat free sour cream and 1 c. skim milk instead of heavy cream I used pre-minced garlic from a jar to taste I ommitted the butter went light on salt and cooked for over 1 1/2 hours at 325. They were perfection! This recipe is especially good for those who loved crusty baked cheese. However lovers of ooey gooey cheese won't be disappointed with what lies underneath.",

I added more salt and garlic than the recipe called for, but there still seemed to be a dearth of flavor, probably because there was too much cream in the recipe.  The cheese layers definitely saved the dish.  Next time I will cut back on the cream by at least half and replace with garlic-infused milk.  \r\n\r\nTips:  \r\n-I increased cooking temp to 400F--but you might want to cover lightly with a piece of aluminum foil so the cheddar doesn't brown too fast.  \r\n\r\n-I used a mandolin to cut potatoes very thinly (a food processor would work too) and then I blanched the slices in a pot of boiling water for about 10 mins--don't let them get soft!  I patted them dry, then layered them and had NO problems with cooking time. \r\n\r\nSo, all in all: more salt/garlic, less cream, increase oven temp, slice potatoes thinly and blanch before layering.     \r\n",

I followed the recipe with respect to the cheeses, using sharp cheddar, parmesan, and provolone, and these were great.  I used Half-and-half instead of cream, as was suggested, so I would recommend this to others.  Also, as others have said the butter could be reduced, mine WOULD have been rather greasy except that in the last half hour (when I removed it from the oven to add Parmesan on top) I drained the excess butter from the pan, because it was looking too greasy.  I will definitely make this again, but probably with only a little bit of butter.",
