As I steamed cooked my squash, I made a mixture of the other ingredients by omitting the cheese and adding shredded fresh carrots and sweet, succulent pimentos.  I put a cup of the cornbread stuffing on the bottom of my 9x13 dish, added my squash mixture and then put another cup of the cornbread stuffing on top.  Baked in the oven at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes.  Whoooooooo, Buddy!  Boy howdy, did this turn out great!  My cat and I highly recommend that you use the cornbread stuffing over any other type of stuffing.  I think I need to hit up my brother for some more  fresh squash so I can make it again.",
