I love chicken salad and I had two leftover herb grilled chicken breasts and a lonely red bell pepper that needed to be used up before grocery night. What a pleasant surprise this little recipe turned out to be! I cooked the bell pepper as instructed and put everything into the food processor along with the salt pepper as well as a bit of garlic and onion powders. I didn't have any heavy cream so I used half and half with light mayo (added a little more than called for). I let this chill for an hour before serving. This chicken salad was creamy and delicious. It was perfect on melba toast and next time I might try it in a wrap! Thanks for a really great recipe.",

The idea of the red pepper really appealed to me (I took a shortcut and microwaved it) - but what threw me was when I (finally) noticed that the chicken was to be blended in the food processor along with the red pepper mayo and cream. With all respect to the submitter that did NOT appeal to me although I understand that foods you grew up with you don t necessarily think of as odd when others not familiar with it might. For me it was I envisioned basically homemade baby food. So instead I pureed the red pepper mayonnaise and cream and it made an exquisitely beautiful sauce but it was pretty blah tasting. I doctored it up with some garlic salt a shot of Worcestershire sauce and some chopped green onion and not only was it an instant fix it was wonderful. I mixed that sauce up with the chicken and I had the chunkiness and flavor I desired. I wanted something a little more interesting than just sandwiching it between two slices of white bread so I used it along with strips of bacon fresh baby spinach and tortillas to make wraps and they were AWESOME good! To complete the meal I served them with a hearty bowl of chicken minestrone.",

Doesn't have to be real salty but the results are very flavorful and moist chicken. Drain pat dry. Rub with olive oil sprinkle with Cavendars Greek Seasoning and here's the kicker slip 2 or 3 whole basil leaves under the skin. Line a cookie sheet with foil place the chicken on a wire rack on the cookie sheet. Roast in a preheated 425F oven for about 1 hour depending on the size of the breasts. Remove tent with foil and let rest until cooled. Remove the skin debone chop. I love adding roasted red bell pepper golden raisins and depending on my mood maybe some curry powder maybe not. A touch of honey is nice garlic powder black pepper. Just play with it. The combinations are endless.",
