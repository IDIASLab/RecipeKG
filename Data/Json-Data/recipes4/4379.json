I served the whole amt to 2 for a hearty serving.  I stuck to the veggie amts but also added about 6 button mushrooms.  Didn't measure so much as eyeballed. Only thing I really changed was the beef broth and used maybe 4 t tomato paste.  I used reduced sodium broth and ended up with about a cup and a half reduced down to almost nothing before adding cream. Added enoki with the broth and didn't brown, chopped before cooking.  Served over  shirataki noodles instead of pasta, added them before cream to soak and flavor.  Topped with Reggiano, garlic cheese bread on the side. Fabulous!",

Don't get me wrong, I really loved the dish, but I didn't get the tiny quantities.  If my math is correct, this recipe has just less than 3 T liquid ingredients per serving which doesn't even begin to cover a serving of pasta (IMHO).  I don't know if that's a mistake or that's the intention and I don't get it.  But, the bottom line is that this is absolutely delicious and I will make it again, but with maybe four times the liquid and two or three times the vegetables!!",
