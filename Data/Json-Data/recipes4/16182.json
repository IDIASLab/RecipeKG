I love this recipe and so did my husband. We actually don't use ground beef here but we used 93% 7% ground turkey and it was phenomenal. We also didn't have the provolone cheese which was okay because it was splendid. A must try recipe!!!!!",

I added 1/2 tsp salt,\n1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp rosemary, 1 tsp oregano, and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  I like my meatloaf with a bit of a glaze on top, so I brushed with ketchup mixed with Italian seasoning.  Next time I will omit ketchup from meat mixture entirely and only use it in the topping.  My only real complaint is with the texture- very crumbly.  Next time, I will omit the bread crumbs and replace with bread and milk.  Sounds like a lot of changes, but really the original recipe is pretty much intact.  The provolone, fresh basil, and sun-dried tomatoes are right on the mark and I'll definitely be repeating this one!",
