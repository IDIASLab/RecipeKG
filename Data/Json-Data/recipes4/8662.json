I halved the recipe and my 3 year old and I finished it at one sitting. I used 2 large links of mild italian turkey sausage and took the meat out of the casing. Browned the meat in a 2 quart pot removed and then added the onion and some chopped celery. Then soon added the broth and a splash of water brown rice (healthier and takes just as long to cook as the lentils) and lentils. Brought to a boil then set to low for 40 min. Added the sausage back into the mix a few minutes before the lentils were done. My son gobbled this up.",

Well 70 minutes on the stove and only some of the rice was fully cooked. Most was partially done but luckily the dish was still edible. The flavor was overpowering for me but my two companions loved it. Next time I think I'll use low-sodium broth or cut regular broth with water and I'll serve this over rice instead of including rice in the casserole.

So I upped the rice lentils and broth and also added some barley (probably one third cup). It made it less meaty and increased the servings to probably seven or eight. I also added four cloves of garlic. The sausage I used was spicy and it added a ton of flavor. This is very hearty and delicious- definitely agree with all who call it comfort food- it has that feel for sure. Thanks for the recipe Jill- I will make this again and again.
