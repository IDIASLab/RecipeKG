My new husband and his buddies ask me to make it for our football parties every Sunday!\n\nI use three chicken breasts, 3/4 of the bottle of wing sauce, 3-4 tbsp. butter and only about 1/4 c. of the blue cheese dressing (just enough to spread over the top).  This makes for the perfect consistency - any more sauce and it's too runny, and the leftovers (if any!) get too greasy and gross when reheated.  I always serve with Fritos Scoops and the guys LOVE it.  Reheats well too with the reduced amount of sauce.",

I think you could use canned chicken or left over chicken from dinner or whatever. I used my leftover Broiled Chicken from Costco and chopped it into small pieces.
