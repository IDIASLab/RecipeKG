For example. try throwing in a handful of shredded American cheese for a cheesy bread. Also, when you make this bread, do be sure to measure in the oil before adding the honey. This way, you have an oiled spoon to measure the honey with, and the honey just slides out nicely instead of sticking to the spoon.",

Very tasty and delicious.\n\nI did as others recommended, and doubled the recipe to create a full-size loaf. I baked it at 350 for 1 hour in a loaf pan, and that was perfect.\n\nSubstitutes I did: Skim milk instead of whole. Extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I added 1/2 cup of ground flax seeds. Both the olive oil and ground flax added healthy fats to the bread, and the flax also added a little extra fiber and protein.\n\nI also didn't grind the oats, either. I like having big pieces of grain in my breads.\n\nThanks for sharing your recipe! It's so nice baking bread at home so you can control what goes into it.",

I also made these additions for flavor:  3/4 cup raisins, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp imitation vanilla.  Also, I did not grind the oatmeal and found that I would prefer it this way.

I doubled the ingredients and poured the batter/dough into a loaf pan. I baked it at a slighly lower temperature for a bit longer and it turned out beautifully. I did cover the loaf with foil about halfway through the baking time. I only substituted one ingredient: I used vanilla soy milk instead of cow's milk - I realized as I combined the dry ingredients that I was out! The vanilla flavor did wonders for the bread. It's a tinge sweeter I think than if I had used regular milk. It made my home smell wonderful too as it baked. I will definitely make this bread again probably substituting something else (applesauce or yogurt) for the oil and I may add other fruits nuts or seeds if something catches my fancy. All in all a fabulously simple tasty and nutritious bread. Thank you SO much!",

I didn't grind the oatmeal, subbed applesauce for oil, soy milk for milk, and 1 Tbsp of splenda for the honey because I didn't have honey. I added about 1/2 C of ground flaxseed, about 1/4 C of unprocessed bran, and some sesame seeds just because I like them. I also sprinkled some sesame seeds on top and sprayed the top of the dough with spray oil. It turned out dense and soft on the inside with a nice crust. When I made it a 2nd time with less additions, 1 C of milk was too much. I'm going to experiment with more add ins, like seeds or dried fruit. Love this bread!",
