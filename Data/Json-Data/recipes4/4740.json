I also left out the poppy seeds and used a mixture of minced garlic and onion powder (1 tbsp total). I made 12 with swiss cheese and 12 with muenster cheese. Don't be afraid to pour the entire mixture over the rolls. I was worried it was way too much at first and left some in the bowl. I was wrong! The topping cooks into the rolls perfectly. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks Lisa!",

We used yellow mustard, onions, butter and poppy seeds with ham and swiss cheese and made the sandwiches individually with the mustard, onion, butter mixture on the inside of the sandwich.  We wrapped them individually in foil, froze them, and popped them in the oven for poker night.  Our version was always a hit and you can make a ton and keep them on hand for after-school snacks.",

The must have is King's Hawaiian rolls. Don't buy the knock off's make sure it is that brand, it gives the sandwiches the sweet that everyone loves. The other thing I changed on purpose is I used provolone cheese only because my hubby doesn't like swiss...but I think it would be good either way. I forgot to add the minced onion and would be good with or without. I also added a little more worcestshire only because I looked at the recipe wrong.  I lined a cookie sheet with foil, put the bottoms of the rolls down first (I did slice them in half while they were all connected like others suggested), I put the cheese next, topped with ham that I doubled over to fit the bun (I used a good maple ham), then I put on the top of the bun. I spooned a tablespoon of the mixture on top of each bun and placed a sheet of foil loosely over the top. The buns were buttery from the mixture and just a little crusty, but nice and soft inside. I did have plenty of butter mixture left over, so I think it is safe to cut back on the butter mixture ingredients or there is plenty to add another 12 sandwiches or so. Yummy! UPDATE: Do not use all of the butter mixture...it makes the rolls too buttery. I would use a teaspoon to drizzle a spoonful on top of each one and probably no more.",

I also didn't want all that butter, so I used 1/3 cup of butter, 1 tbsp dijon (I'd add a little more next time), no worcestershire, no poppy seeds, but added 1 tsp of splenda brown a sprinkle or two of tarragon and a pinch of onion powder. I used honey maple ham and muenster cheese and only 16 tea rolls. The tea rolls were great because they were stuck together so I cut all of them in half as one block and assembled the sandwiches in one great square. I put the ham down first, then the cheese and spread a thin layer of may on the top inside so it would melt into the cheese. Then I sliced through them and placed them 1/2\" apart on a foil lined pan. I drizzled each one with a scant tablespoon of the sauce and covered them lightly in with foil because I wanted the rolls to steam a bit. It turned out amazing! The rolls were nicely browned on top and slightly crunchy on the edges and bottom. The sauce flavor was slightly sweet and tangy but not overly rich, perfect! So feel free to reduce the butter :)",
