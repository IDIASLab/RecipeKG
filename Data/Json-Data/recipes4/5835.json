Subbed ricotta for mayo (used about a tablespoon of mayo to keep consistency smoother) Stuck with the garlic, spread about a tablespoon of parmesan over the reviewers' suggested mayo on crust. Also, from another recipe, dipped the tomatoes in flour before putting them down on crust. I was determined not to have a soggy crust, and I succeeded! \nThe cheese mixture was still a little thick and hard to spread evenly. But it was creamy good once cooked.",

Some used dill instead of basil because that is what they grew to make their dill pickles. There is a reason to salt the tomatoes, to draw out the moisture so the pie is not soggy.  If you slice them thinly there is no need to skin them.  Many southern recipes are handed around from person to person with no one knowing who came up with the original.  This one is good but if you want one that is truly EXCELLENT  try the one on Sweet Tea and Cornbread's blog, it is even richer and creamier than this one -- and I loved my GRANNY's tomato pie, but ST&C just takes it over the top.",

I also used dried basil as I didn't have any fresh and it was just as good. Tomato pie has been around down here as long as anyone can remember; it's a staple at southern luncheons and family gatherings. It's a staple dish in old family cookbooks and it's a dish that many young women learn to make when helping their mothers in the kitchen. The recipe changes from person to person and region to region but underneath it's the same delicious tomato pie that all of us know and love. Paula Dean deserves credit for introducing it to a wider audience but I'll bet you anything this was a dish she learned from her momma. So while some people may have learned this recipe from watching cooking shows many of us learned to cook this from our mothers aunts and grandmothers in a kitchen full of love and laughter and the warm aroma of southern cooking.",
