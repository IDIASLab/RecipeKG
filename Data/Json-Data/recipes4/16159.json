To solve the caramel issue use HEAVY CREAM to melt the caramels into sauce. If you don't have cream use WHOLE MILK (2% or less fat milk has TOO MUCH water that will just cook away during baking making the caramels hard and chewy).",

The thing I didn't like is after microwaving the caramel it doesn't just smoothly pour on. It is clumpy and blobs on the brownies. There is no uniformity to how it pours on. They tasted good but the lumpy hard caramel was kind of hard to eat. The saving grace was the salted caramel. The flavors were good but it doesn't quite work. One reviewer suggested melting the caramel with cream that would be better I think. Also after melting the caramel the bowl was soooo hard to wash. If you run into that problem pour some boiling water in the bowl to get the hard caramel off.",

I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly so I don't know why people had issues. My only guess is make sure you do not overheat your caramel (should be able to easily stur and pour it when its ready). DO NOT forget to add the milk to your caramels. This makes it much creamier easier to handel and will make it an easier consistency to eat. Also make sure your brownie batter is already spread in your pan and then lightly drizzle the caramel sauce on top (do not mix in or pour in before the batter is in your pan). These make an incredibly impressive dessert that looks like you slaved over them for hours. Nobody would ever guess its just a spruced-up box mix!",
