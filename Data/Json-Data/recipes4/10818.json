Then I turned off heat and let it sit for 30 minutes without removing the lid of the pressure cooker.  The pork was so tender it fell apart as I tried to remove it from the pot.  My advice if you do use pressure cooker is to only add the 16 oz of water or else the flavor is not as strong.  I used 24 oz water and I had to add more spices later while It was frying.  To avoid dry pork, I stir fried it on ultra high heat until it was toasted on the outside and added the onions during the last 5 minutes.   Remember, you want it moist and tender inside and crispy on the outside so you must use high heat  to accomplish this.  Maybe a couple of bay leaves might make it better too.",

I cooked the meat (country style ribs which could tolerate the long cooking time without drying out) in the crock pot and was disappointed it had so little flavor. At this point I m thinking the last step frying it up and adding onion garlic and lime juice would take care of that. It did not. All that step managed to do was dry it up and even tho a GOOD amount of butter and olive oil doctored that right up you shouldn t have to do that with a good recipe. I served this with yellow rice and Cuban Black Beans II also from this site. I ate mine as is but it definitely could have used some sort of sauce to moisten it up and make it more palatable. Hubs took care of his with a good plop of sour cream. Shouldn t be. If I was to make this again I would NOT fry the meat. I d cook the onions and garlic till tender add the meat and just heat it through then add the cilantro and lime juice. And I wouldn t think of making this with a lean cut of meat like boneless pork chops that s just asking for trouble. Bottom line this was only mediocre and mediocre is disappointing to me.",
