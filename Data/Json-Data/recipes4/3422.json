My husbands eyes light up when I tell him that we are having out Southwest Chicken salad for dinner with this dressing.  It is way better than anything you can buy in the store.  We do add a little less honey like others have stated.  You can add a little more lime if you want it to be a little more tangy, or a little more vinegar for more of a vinegarette flavor.  One time I put about 4x the vinegar (on accident) and it still tasted great.    We just put the whole thing in our Vita-mix blender in the order it is written and blend it up - it turns out great that way, and you don't have to chop everything.    For our Southwest salad we do 1-2 heads of lettuce, 2 cobs of raw white corn kernels, 1 large can of black beans rinsed, 1 bag of Montery Jack cheese, 1 red onion, grilled chicken breast, and 1 bunch of cilantro.  We have also added tomatoes and avocado if you like them.    Thank you to the poster of this recipe, you did a great job!",

Ginger has a strong distinct flavor so I feel a little strange about reviewing with such a big change. My husband hates ginger.  I decided to go ahead and review though because it is so good even with out the ginger. I am not  big on sweet dressings so I cut down on the honey a bit just do to personal preference. I have not been able to stop thinking about it. Wonderful flavor!\n(update 6-2011) I just finally made this with the ginger and it is even better! Unless you have a ginger hater, put it in!",

As suggested by several reviewers, I switched the quantities of lime juice and honey so that there was a total of a scant 1/4 c. honey and just over 1/3 c. (three fresh limes' worth) of lime juice. I also added TWO bunches of cilantro. I have never had the original restaurant version that this recipe is attempting to duplicate, but I would argue that it is still just a tad on the sweet side. I think I'll try only 2T of honey next time I make it, but I WILL be making it again as it's really good. It is also really great mixed with a little ranch dressing for a cooler, more soothing dressing if some don't like the peppiness of this one.",

Good to keep in mind for those of you looking to lower the fat content or if you don't have enough cilantro.  It's still great!\n\nOther changes: I used sugar instead of honey because I didn't feel like using up my honey supply.  This worked very well.  I didn't measure the sugar but just added  more until it tasted right.  And I don't have a food processor, so I chopped everything as finely as I could and shook it up in a jar.\n\nDelicious!  If the cilantro chopping didn't take a year, I'd make it all the time!",
