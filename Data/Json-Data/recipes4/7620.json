        "description": "My family loves this recipe. It's easy to do and you get a chicken pot pie that's way better than what you buy at the store. A complete, homemade meal in 1 pie dish. I normally cook up more chicken than I need. I then take the leftover chicken and stock and freeze it for use in something else later. As much as my family loves this recipe, the extra doesn't last long. I like to make a nice lettuce salad to go along with. Remember you can use whatever veggies you like whether they are frozen, fresh, or canned. It's always nice to fix this in the summer when you can get your veggies from the garden or the farmer's market, but canned and frozen work great too.",

Due to the pie taking an hour to bake I think leftover seasoned chicken or a rotisserie chicken is a time saver here. What I liked best about this recipe is how you could use whatever veggie you had on hand. My potatoes carrots and onions were fresh but I was able to use frozen corn and lima beans from the freezer. I was afraid the fresh veggies would be hard and the frozen would turn to mush but they all turned out just right. This was my first time cooking a pot pie and it did not disappoint!",
