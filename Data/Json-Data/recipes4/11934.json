I should call it \"6 Treasures\" because I left out the ham and ground beef. (We don't eat a lot of red meat.) I made a half recipe for a family of four and only used 3 cups of water since it seemed like 4 would be too watery. It turned out just right. I did add some chicken bullion to make the broth more flavorful since I did not use the meat and I used a can of minishrimp and included the liquid in the can. I think next time I will use full sized shrimp since we all love shrimp. I sauteed the tofu in the vegetable oil before adding the veggies then added the broth then the shrimp and lastly the egg. The other change I made was to use frozen corn instead of creamed; thought the creamed would be too sweet. I used shitakes for the mushrooms. I didn't let the soup simmer too long so the ingredients wouldn't get too mushy. I also added a splash of soy sauce and it turned out great! Thanks for a nice soup recipe.",
