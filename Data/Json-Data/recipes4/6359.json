I love making these beans just because they make the whole house smell so good, and the longer they simmer the better they taste. You could add 1/2 can of beer to make 'borracho' beans. I personally taste-test throughout the entire cooking process and add extra seasoning as I feel it needs it. These beans could simmer all day long; just make sure they have plenty of water to keep the beans covered.",

I use this method for soaking beans...America's Test Kitchen suggests that if you really want a creamy, smooth texture without mushy, gluey beans, you should brine them\u2014that is, soak them in salt water\u2014instead of letting them soak in the fridge in plain tap water.  Soak 1 pound beans 8 hours or overnight covered with 4 quarts water and 3 tbsp salt. On counter- not fridge. Drain, add fresh water. They come out sooo tasty and perfect. Thanks for the recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "This was good, AFTER I severely altered how it's made.  First, COOK the bacon (throwing bacon into boiling water just results in RUBBER).  Remove bacon from pan, saving fat.  Add all the dry spices and 2 chopped onions, NOT just one.  Cook all over medium heat.  You may need to add a bit of water so you can glaze the pan and get all the roasted spices to not stick...  THEN add these ingredients to your beans which soaked overnight.  Also, I didn't have the canned tomatoes with green chilies, but I did have a big jar of chunky salsa...which, if you read the ingredients are exactly the same.  The cooking and browning of the bacon, spices and onions really brings out the flavor 100 fold over just tossing them into the boiling water.",

Then I threw in the beans and other ingredients except for the cilantro. I brought all the ingredients to a boil for a few minutes then reduced the heat and simmered for about 30 minutes.

When it was close to done stir fried up peppers with the onion and added it to individual bowls. Topped with Mexican cheese, salsa, and sour cream. Used tortilla chips to dip with. Outstanding.
