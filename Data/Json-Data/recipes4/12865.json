It is slightly sweet, infused with the complexity of cloves, ginger, bay leaves & more. Do know that the sauce will be the consistency of a reduced balsamic or thin maple syrup. I marinated pork chops in 2 Tblsp., then served the sauce over the grilled chops; truly delicious. I will also try this on steaks (as intended) & chicken, as I have 1 cup left after making the recipe for 12 servings. (AR's \"Recalculate\" feature is VERY useful! Plug in any # of servings you want, to make a smaller quantity.) And when I have finished this batch (which I think will keep well in the refrigerator), I will make more! ***UPDATE:*** I originally made the sauce in April 2009.  In Feb. 2010 the sauce is still excellent (having been in a clean bottle & in the fridge all this time). I've since used it on grilled steaks ~ superb, of course! I highly recommend this. Do not let the long ingredients list keep you away ~ it is very simple to put all the ingredients into a pot & simmer it. And it will keep refrigerated for a very, very long time.",

I made this with grilled tenderloins and sauteed mushrooms - added a little of the sauce to the mushrooms while they were cooking but only seasoned the beef with a little salt and pepper. The sauce will thicken slightly when it reduces but is meant to be thin - like the consistency of thin maple syrup or good balsamic (I was able to find the recipe submitter on the Recipe Exchange to ask her what the proper consistency would be). I imagine you could add corn starch near the end if you like your sauce thicker but this was perfect for me as is. The flavor is familiar like something I may have had in a restaurant - but not like anything you can buy. Excellent! Thanks KORIEKISS!",

I forgot to take into account that it would reduce to half it's volume. I skipped the cayenne pepper and jalapeno and used a couple drops of Tabasco instead. I let it sit overnight and served with steak the next day. This recipe allows us to have a steak sauce with the heat toned down. I plan to always have this sauce on hand.

Sweet tart tangy spicy savory - all at the same time. I was thinking I might like to thicken it a bit but ended up not straying from the recipe and it was just fantastic as is. I adjusted to six servings to try out but next time I'll make a full recipe so I'll have some to keep on hand. I feel like a gourmet chef making my own steak sauce!;) Thanks for a great recipe!",

It wasn't bad it has actually a really nifty and unique flavor but it didn't nearly rock my world as much as it did for the other reviewers. I'd have been better off with the store-brand B-2 knockoff: equally tasty and much less work. Tasty yes worth the effort notsomuch. I followed the halved recipe to the letter minus the cloves (which I didn't realize I didn't have). If anyone wants to try to convince me that that would have made all the difference I may be willing to try it again but otherwise I'll stick with the bottle.

I cut this in half because there are only two of us. It was nice to sit back and let it cook. You do need to make sure the temperature is closer to Medium than low to get it to reduce. I ended up with maybe 1 1/4 cup of sauce. That was reduced down from 3 cups of apple juice 1/2 cup soy and molasses. I did use canned jalapeno peppers instead of fresh but the heat was still there but in a pleasant way if you don't like spicy things don't be afraid of it being spicy it was very pleasant. I've frozen about a 1/2 cup can't wait to use it again.",
