I made a few changes: I only used about a tablespoon of olive oil in the beginning, I added garlic with the onions, I drained off the fat before adding the wine and I only added 8 ounces of mozzarella. For those of you that found their cheese sauce to be too runny, it was because you didn't allow the sauce to thicken up. It's best to bring the butter/flour/milk mixture to a boil over medium heat. This process should take about 15-20 minutes to make a really thick sauce. I ended up using Yellow Tail Pinot Grigio and just a jar of spaghetti sauce. It turned out great! ",

                "reviewBody": "My family really enjoyed this recipe but did make a few changes: (1) Only used 1 tbsp of olive oil for frying the onions/meat (didn't want all the calories of 8 tbsp of oil!). (2) Added some hot Italian sausage to the ground beef mixture - really added zip and next time I will add more sausage. (I removed the sausage skin so the meat blended right in with the ground beef.) (3) Next time I'll use a bit more flour to make the Bechamel sauce since the meat/sauce mixture ended up being too runny. (4) As per other reviews make sure you first drain the stewed tomatoes - otherwise it would be way too sloppy. And I used Italian-flavored stewed tomatoes - really adds flavor. (5) I used shredded four-blend Italian cheese (reduced fat version) which is readily available in our grocery stores. It was a nice blend of cheeses for this dish. (6) It really helped to only cook half the manicotti shells at a time to keep them from sticking... and I use the term \"manicotti\" since I think that at least here in Canada this is what \"Cannelloni\" is called. Could be wrong but I couldn't find anything called cannelloni in the grocery store. While this recipe does take a bit of prep time don't be put off by that since all in all it's relatively easy to make and a nice treat!!",

Use Italian Sausage the recipe doesn't specify it but OH WHAT A DIFFERENCE. it's absolutely to die for in taste and you don't have to drain the oil. (who browns ground beef in oil anyways? I don't have sage on hand so I skipped it. 2.when making the beschamel add milk a small amount at a time (stirring constantly) and as soon as it thickens add more. This leads to a delicious sauce. 3. Boil the noodles while making the sauce to poor over this will let you simmer your sauce while you stuff your canneloni. Oh and for those of you who are just pretending to be Italian like me manicotti shells are considered canneloni shells here in the good ole us of a. HAPPY EATING and THANK YOU MARBALET!",
