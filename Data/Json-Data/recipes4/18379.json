Everyone ate 2 including my 6 year old. Nothing I would change about this recipe. Thanks!",

My batch made 9 very full muffin cups. The tops with the crispy parmesan are yummy -- so maybe instead of 9 heaping muffins try 12 not-so-full muffins. that way you'll have more crispy top per muffin. I'm going to give them another shot.",

Be sure to press the shredded zucchini to drain of the excess liquid and add some extra Parmesan cheese to the top for a nice brown finish and crunchiness.

We like to have them on trips as breakfast travel food because the muffins are good cool though best five minutes out of the oven or reheated briefly in the microwave.",
