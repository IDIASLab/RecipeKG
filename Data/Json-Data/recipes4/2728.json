This wasn't a day before pay day issue, just an \"I don't feel like going to the store issue\" and I was happy to find a side dish with common ingredients readily at hand. I stir fried the celery and carrot separately in sesame oil before adding the rice (no need at all to cover and steam) and added shrimp rather than chicken since that's what was around. No green onions, but chopped fresh chives from the garden was a perfect substitute.  To make this more authentic, I cooked the egg separately in a small saute pan like a crepe, then added it chiffonade style. (Roll the \"egg crepe\" up like a cigar, then slice into ribbons...then add to rice mixture just before serving) I added a touch of toasted sesame oil for additional flavor, along with a little butter.  Even using ingredients with basic, on hand ingredients this turned out to be a beautiful and delicious dish!",

I followed the suggestions of some previous reviews: 1) scrambled eggs in 1tbsp butter 2) used sesame oil 3) stir-fried 4 cloves garlic and half a roughly chopped onion in the oil before adding the rice. To suit my personal tastes I added half a tbsp. red chili paste when adding the soy sauce and about 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro the last 15 seconds of stir-frying. Will most definitely make again soon. also used Slow-Cooker Turkey Breast from this site instead of chicken because that happened to be the leftovers I had on hand Thanks CJ!",

I also added some chopped sweet onion sauteed the vegetables in a little sesame oil and EVOO before adding the rice. I made Five Spice Chicken Wings (only I used chicken legs) to go with it and stirred in the leftover sauce/drippings into the rice which made it even more flavorful. I don't know about other cook's that have issues with cooking eggs in with the rice. I cooked mine in a saucepan seperately then shredded it and added it to the rice. It was easier for me. Very very good. I'd make this again. This makes a lot and is filling to boot.",
