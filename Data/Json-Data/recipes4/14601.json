You work the dumpling dough adding a bit more milk if needed to just make the dough come together.  Then ROLL the dough out to about a 1/4\" thickness.  Then using a pizza cutter cut the dumplings into squares.  DO NOT DIVIDE DOUGH INTO 12 PIECES.  You will end up with undercooked dumplings.  This is way too much dough to divide into 12 pieces.",
