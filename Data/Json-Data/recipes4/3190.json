                "reviewBody": "Some wise advice when making this recipe would be to make sure you have all your ingredients out and all your cheeses shredded before beginning,because you need to stir the flour mixture continuously. This recipe does not take long to prepare, and the sauce is very rich, with all the cheeses. Also, the liquid smoke is a necessary ingredient for the smokey flavor this recipe is intending to deliver. Although I feel this is a delightful tasting dish, I enjoy traditional mac & cheese a bit better. Sometimes a shot of liquid smoke to regular mac & cheese lends a great flavor. But I enjoyed the experience of trying the different cheeses in this recipe, such as the swiss, which I had never used in a mac & cheese recipe. All said and done, I would make this again for a change of pace. Thanks for sharing! ",

Awesome!\n\nI wanted to sneak some veggies in for my kids, so I cut the macaroni in half and did a 12 oz. package of cauliflower I blanched for a couple minutes. I also sauteed a couple large handfuls of matchstick carrots in with the onion and garlic. My kids aren't big on cream cheese in their macaroni, so I used 1/2 c. of sour cream, which was a nice touch, and I also added a little Frank's. Everything else I kept the same. Very, very good. You couldn't tell that there was cauliflower or carrots in it. My kids and husband inhaled it and asked for more. I will suggest that if you make this, you might want to half it unless you have a big family. This fills a large 9x13 baking dish!\n\nTIP: If you chop the cauliflower in small pieces, it unnoticable when you add it to macaroni dishes!",

                "reviewBody": "I made this along with meatloaf tonight and it was amazing! I don't know what those 1 star raters are talking about. I did make a change or two. The first change I made was to the roux. I did not add 1/4 cup flour because in my experience with making mac and cheese, too much flour will make it dry no matter how much liquid you use. I instead melted the butter, cooked the onion and garlic then slowly drizzled in the flour and stopped at a certain point. Then after that I let it cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Then I added the milk and half and half and cooked for ten minutes. After that I did the following in order with the pan on low on the stove: I added the cream cheese, stirring until the mixture was smooth, then I added the Parmesan and mixed until smooth, then I added the cheddar in three parts, mixing until smooth after every addition, then I added the Monterrey jack in three parts, stirring until smooth after every addition, then added the Swiss in three parts, stirring until smooth after every addition. Then I added the pasta. I omitted the smoked flavor and the bread crumb topping and I added seasoning salt and black pepper to the roux before I added the cheese. This was a nice recipe and there is no reason why, if you follow my tips, that you cannot achieve smooth sauce. Remember, adding cold ingredients to a hot sauce when the pan is off the stove is going to yield griddy results. This is just experience over 19 years, I started when I was 8 years old.",

I followed the recipe pretty much except that I didn't have Swiss so I used a \"fiesta\" mix of shredded cheese (Monterey Jack Asiago etc.) and I didn't top it with breadcrumbs. I've never had mac and cheese with liquid smoke but it was absolutely delicious and I love the flavor it added. I'll definitely be making this again!",
