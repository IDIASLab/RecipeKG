I brushed the loafs with egg yolk and actually baked this in a convection toaster oven on a broiler rack and pan.  I needed a little longer cooking time than the recipe called for, but an instant read thermometer helped determine when it was done.  The loaves had beautiful golden brown crusts and the slices made a nice presentation on the plate.  We enjoyed them the second day by reheating a loaf in the toaster oven.  This is a keeper.",
