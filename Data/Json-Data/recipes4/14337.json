Sorry more of you cooks don't have this ingredient to add to your dishes! The taste is very nice we used plain ol' applesauce from a can. Also instead of truffle oil we just used olive oil. My husband add more garlic to this dish that what was called for (he always does this!) He enjoyed blending the first part as required and was very impressed with the way it looked upon return to the pan. We are simmering it right now sipping it a little here and there. It's going to be fantastic. We will serve this as a side dish to main dinners and enjoy it as comfort food each night in front of the TV until it's gone. Thanks so much.:))",
