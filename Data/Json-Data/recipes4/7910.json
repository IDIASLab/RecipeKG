As written it flavors the gravy great but  it  is kind of like a bay leaf that gets discarded in the end.

I had to change just a couple things. I didn t have a Dutch oven or any bacon and I had already cooked de-boned and cut up several leg quarters. I intended to add a can of plain Ro Tel but mistakenly used a variety with lime juice and cilantro. I also used more onion and added celery. Cooked it all slowly on the stove top in a big deep pan and served it over rice. Thanks for sharing it. I ll definitely be cooking this one again!",
