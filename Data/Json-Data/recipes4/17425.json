I'm not sensitive to gluten but these sounded interesting and I had all the ingredients so I whipped up a batch. The only slight thing I did different was to use fat-free cheddar. I was trying to split the batter between 12 muffin cups but I only ended up with 10. They are on the small side but don't let their size fool you - they are PACKED with flavor and satisfy any carb or salty craving. These will make a nice addition to my weekday breakfasts paired with my eggs and veggies. I also love that they are low-carb. Thank you Angela for the fabulous recipe!",
