I made mushroom broth in my crockpot the night prior to assembling this recipe using 1/2 lb sliced mushrooms 1/2 white onion chopped and 4 cups of water. I actually reserved some of the mushrooms and added them to the ingredients. I wanted a lot more veggies in this stew so I doubled the carrots and potatoes and added some celery. I used a \"chicken seasonings blend\" of fresh rosemary thyme and sage from the supermarket as a shortcut and that worked out great! This recipe is really adaptable to however you want to make it but it's just as delicious precisely as written.",

It was like soup when I started but by the time the beans had cooked the liquid was almost gone, what was left was kinda slimmy. It's still very good, I love the flavor.  Next time i will cook on the stove, used canned beans added the potatoes at the same time and only cook til potatoes are done, then it should be more like a soup.  I might play around w/ dried spices also cause the fresh ones are to expensive and I usually only end up using a tiny bit then they go bad so its a waste of money. ",

I followed VONTEITY's recommendations from January 2005 and made mushroom soup from scratch overnight while the beans were soaking in another container. After the beans soaked overnight I boiled them for about 5 minutes and then cut the heat and let them soak for about an hour before including them with the other ingredients. I discarded the vegetables from the mushroom broth and added 8 ounces of chopped mushrooms to the recipe. I also doubled the vegetables in the recipe and omitted the vegetable bouillon. Since it is winter I substituted 1 tsp each of rosemary thyme and savory for the fresh sprigs. I also added 1 tsp of poultry seasoning and added 1 small can of (mild) minced chilies. I cooked everything for about 9 hours and served this with some French bread. This is not a spur-of the moment recipe. I think the mushroom broth adds some flavor to this dish. However preparing this recipe is pretty simple. I will definitely make this again.",
