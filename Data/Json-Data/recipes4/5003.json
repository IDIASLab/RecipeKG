At their regattas, which last from sun-up to sun-down, we moms have to feed over 100 people (50 'starving' teenagers and their families). We assemble the wraps outside on portable tables and mix the coleslaw in a huge 20 gallon storage container! Several moms form an assembly line to build the wraps. We then roll them in paper and store them in coolers for lunch and snacking all day long. They hold up well and the leftovers are still good the next day!",

I will be making the coleslaw as a side by itself for sure. This sandwich reminded me of a Pittsburgh original sandwich from the restaurant Primanti Brothers. This one doesn't have french fries but i didnt miss them. Eat n Park restaurants in our area make a Pittsburgh sandwich that is very much like this. I always wondered why their special slaw was salmon colored and so delish....now i know! I served ours on toasted bread with a slice of bacon and avocado.....like a club sandwich. Enjoy!!!!",
