No matter what I added or reduced, it still tasted too buttery.  I also didn't want hot because we have toddlers in the house who eat them.  Well, this recipe was a hit BUT with some minor modifications like NO BUTTER!!! Even when you cut the butter in half, you still can taste it.  Plus it makes the sauce slide off the wings.  I add about 2T ketchup or a tad more to the 2T honey and 1/3C hot sauce of any kind.  The ketchup and honey really cut down on it being hot ...like the butter would but w/o adding the unneeded GREASE!  They stick real nicely too! I love them!!!  So if you keep thinking something is just not right, try my suggestions!",

It's a great base and allows for multiple alterations. My wife generally just uses the butter and hot sauce (specifically Franks, it seems to be the best for wings.) But after you make the base, you can do just about anything to flavor it. Teriyaki sauce is a good additive, garlic is ALWAYS great, honey is a good sweetener and tends to bring out the flavor, as does brown sugar although you should start small. (Like about a tbsp for this size batch.) But if you're looking for the way we like 'em back home in Buffalo, this is it. Enjoy.",

But If you like wings in general this sauce has outstanding flavor!!!! The ketchup is virtually undetectable it just help make it thicker and the honey gives it a real nice sweetness with just enough pepper sauce to give it some warmth. Not a hot wing sauce but it has real great flavor!!!",

Make sure not to skip the honey. -The longer you let the sauce simmer the thicker it will get. - Depending on the brand of butter or margarine you use sometimes the the oil likes to seperate from the rest of the sauce. In these instances I use a small bat powered milk frother to mix the sauce(a hand immersion blender should work fine also). -If you like a hotter sauce use equal parts butter ketchup and hot sauce.",

Everyone liked this over the hundreds of store bought dry ingredient packages and internet recipes we have painsakingly tried. The ketchup seemed freaky but you cannot tell it is in there. I did make one TINY adjustment - threw a dash of BBQ sauce (not more than a squirt - 3 Tbsp) which was great. I like the sauce to 'stick' to the wings more and think next time cutting the butter down a tad to see if that helps. This definately is a keeper! Cool Beans!",
