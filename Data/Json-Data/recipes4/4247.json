I thought it was excellent and have been eating leftovers for lunches. My husband wasn't real crazy about the thyme but that's a personal flavor issue. He said other than that it was delicious! We both really liked the bacon and I believe including the bacon drippings in the sauce made the whole meal meld together well-- the bacon flavor really added something to traditional mac and cheese! It did take me about an hour even before baking but it tasted great in the end. Thanks for the great recipe!",
