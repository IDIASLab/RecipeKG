Then I baked for half the time it called for and broiled it the other half of the time to make the bacon crisp It was the best meal I ever cooked I've made it twice already and I cant get enough of it.

The chicken itself needed more zip so maybe sprinkling with some barbeque salt would help? I also suggest sauteing fresh mushrooms and onion in garlic butter and a splash of white wine and spooning that in the middle along with some herb and garlic cream cheese wrapping in prosciutto and puff pastry placing seam side down on a cookie sheet brushing with egg whites and baking @ 375 for 40minutes. cover with foil for a while if the pastry is getting too brown.

Plus the combination of cream cheese chives and bacon was a clue to me that this was going to be tasty. Given that my husband loves bacon I had to give this a try. But I did make a couple of changes... First I pounded my chicken breasts down thin. Second I used fresh chives vs. dried and aded a little onion powder to the cream cheese mixture. I cooked my bacon (real bacon not turkey bacon) just until tender-crisp and placed that onto the chicken breasts then added the cream cheese mixture and secured with toothpicks. I dipped the chicken in egg and then seasoned Italian bread crumbs to form a light coating. I then drizzled it with a little melted butter and baked at 375 for 30 mintues. The result was a very moist and flavorful chicken bursting with a delicious cream cheese and bacon center!",

When I came across this one it sounded awesome so I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did!  This is a recipe that you could go nuts modifying!  I used regular bacon...baked for about 10 minutes on a baking sheet.  I then put the butterflied chicken breasts (I used 6 small) on the same baking sheet with the drippings from the bacon.  I seasoned the chicken with granulated garlic, herbs, Adobo, and salt.  I filled the breasts with a mixture of cream cheese, 2 jalapenos (seeded and chopped) and about 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese.  I then wrapped each breast with 2 slices of bacon and baked for about 35 minutes.  OMG...we LOVED this and will definitely be making again.  My daughter had the leftovers for breakfast!!",

Next time I'll probably tweak the filling and use half cream cheese and half feta cheese just to cut the overpowering taste/texture of the cream cheese. I'll also add more garlic and some onion instead of the chives... maybe add some parsley for color.
