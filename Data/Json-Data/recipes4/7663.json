The only change I'd make, and that's just because there are only two of us, is that I'd cook the tortellini separately and add it directly to the bowls.  By the time I put the leftovers away, the remaining pasta had soaked up all of the broth.  I used mild Italian sausage in this, and we both really enjoyed our dinner.",

To make up for some of the lost seasoning I used Italian diced tomatoes. To add nutrients I added shredded carrots with the browning beef/onions/garlic and chopped fresh spinach when I added the tortellini. It was a tad on the bland side for ME so I added some seasoned salt to my bowl and that nailed it for me. THANKS for the recipe!",

Also needed to add another 32 oz. carton of broth after I cooked the  tortellini, but I used dry tortellini.  Fresh tort. may not have required the extra broth.  Finally, I stirred in spinach before serving and topped with fresh grated Parmesan .  Thumbs up from both kids and husband.  FYI- the pepper does add some heat.  If you have kids, you may want to start with 1/2 tsp and add more to taste.  We enjoyed the full tsp.  Very good!",

I added stewed tomatoes and some carrots for a little depth. I also put in a small rind of Parmigiana Reggiano and served with some of it grated as well.  Really rich tasting and delicious with the pasta.  I might like to try a Romano ( more salty and less nutty) next time for a change of pace. \n\nAlso added a little crushed red pepper and a dash hot paprika to give it little heat that really hit the mark at the back of your throat without burning your mouth.  \n\nI used a plain sausage, but it tasted a little plain in a really flavorful soup. I should have seasoned the sausage more  while  browning. Or,  I may try an onion-garlic  or cheese-garlic sausage as suggested.",
