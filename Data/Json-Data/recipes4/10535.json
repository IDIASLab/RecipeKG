Place stuffing on a 9x13\" pan molded into a half sphere.  Cover this with the tofurkey mixture.  I use the maple glaze from the allrecipe called \"Maple Roast Turkey\" by Lipo.  The glaze is WONDERFUL!!!  I have made this the last 3 to 4 years at the holidays and have had to make a bigger batch as even the meat eaters are gobbling it down.  Best vegan gravy is Ann Gentry's Golden Gravy from her Real Food Daily cookbook.  Yum!",

I started by marinating the tofu overnight and adding many spices added fresh parlsey to everything (rubbed sage powedered sage garlic & onion powder oregano chives marjoram savory salt and pepper and made a moist stuffing in accordance with the quantities you are asked to use in the recipe label and increased the margarine and liquid content by more than double in accordance; adding onions celery and mushroom to stuffing and spices also. Made a Vegan Gravy adding fresh parsley and all of the above spices and was added to stuffing and used as a sauce over the tofurkey.

It looked and tasted great--my seriously VEGAN son was thrilled and impressed! By doubling the tofu mixture we were able to serve more; we just added a little extra oven time. We used our usual stuffing recipe but made with soy margarine as suggested and it seemed more traditional for us (we add finely diced celery onions mushrooms apples and red peppers in iron skillet). This seems fussy and complicated but it is really simple. This is much better than any store-bought version and is much cheaper too! THANKS!",

But when I started making it I was like woah this doesn't look anything like I pictured and I was just sure that the paper towel thing wasn't going to work. But I kept going if it didn't turn out oh well. So when it was time to take it out of the fridge the paper towels came off just fine! I was like wahoo but will it taste ok because i was kinda having trouble with the stuffing. I took ya'lls advice and changed the glaze I used a cranberry glaze the \"turkey\" turned out awesome my mom and I were so pleased. I highly recommend that u try it!",
