After all, the ingredients are simple: As long as you've got some kind of protein, potatoes and onions, you're in business. And it makes a fast brunch or even light supper dish, with or without poached eggs.",

My taters were beautiful brown and crisp all up to the time I added the crab/onion/ketchup mix and then they turned into soggy mush. Nature of hash I suppose. This tasted great but if you are looking to serve to guests I recommend plating the potatoes and then drizzling the rest over the potatoes. That way you are keeping all of the flavor but there is more eye appeal to your dish. And lets just face it..we eat with our eyes.",
