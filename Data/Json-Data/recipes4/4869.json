Next time, I will probably brown the meat before adding to the slow cooker just to give it another layer of flavor.  Great basic recipe that could easily be customized to be more spicy or more intense, depending on your flavor buds.  This also would be a great dish to serve at a party - it appeals to many different palates.  Thumbs up!",

So what I did was follow the direction my only change was cook my meat on low for 8 hours. After that I followed the directions and returned it back to the crock pot for 1 hour on high... I also added a good amount of garlic salt to the meat when it was cooking on high, it gave it such great flavor.. This is an amazing recipe and tastes so wonderful!!!! You will be so happy you made it!",
