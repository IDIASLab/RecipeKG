I saut\u00e9ed the onions prosciutto and the asparagus together until the ham was lightly warmed not crisp as to not ruin the prosciutto. I then simply tossed it all together with the pasta at the last minute. The flavours and textures are wonderful together. The saltiness of the ham is intense so I suggest lightly salting the pasta water. Thank you Khatche for your recipe.",
