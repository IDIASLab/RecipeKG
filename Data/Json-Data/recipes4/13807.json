As far as changes really none just a couple of subs. butter for the margarine and half-half for the non-dairy creamer. They worked well. I will say it is very easy and tasty. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is that I thought the Blue Cheese over powered the zucchini just a bit(even though I love my Blue Cheese) I just wanted a touch more zucchini flavor to come through. Made a 2nd time and this time I used less Blue Cheese and I was disappointed didn't taste it enough...oh well. I think I'll stick to the recipe next time.",
