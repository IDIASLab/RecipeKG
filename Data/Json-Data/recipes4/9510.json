Try 250 degrees and check after 20-25 minutes.  If they are still soft, continue baking and check every 5 minutes.  I tried both acrylic paint and poster paint to decorate, both worked equally well.  Don't forget to poke a hole at the top with a straw before baking for the ribbon to hang on the tree.",

I did put the oven down to about 300 and it cut down on the puffiness I also added allspice ginger nutmeg and cinnamon to the recipe to make it a gingerbread color and it smells GREAT while baking. It made about 30 cookies for me. I put a hole in the top w/ the end of a paint brush the straw hole was a bit too big for me. A really cute idea for hanging--gingham rag ties- very country and rustic looking. Try making a rag tie garland as well.",

However anyone who makes these or other food-based ornaments should know that sometimes bugs (or even other attic-dwelling critters!) can ruin your beautiful artwork. To avoid the problem always store flour-based ornaments in airtight boxes. My favorite storage for these are metal cookie/gift boxes which also make the cutest type of package if you are giving these ornaments as gifts!",

To foil critters in the attic spray with a acrylic sealer. I hang them from a dowel inside a big cardboard box so I coat all sides. That will also keep them from bloating if stored somewhere damp. Something else I've tried is to run the dry ingredients through a blender making the salt finer and thus a smoother dough. I made these for a craft sale and every single one sold.",

I halved the recipe and still had a lot more than I needed. You might as well make a small amount it is easy to mix up more later if you want. Keep the dough in a bowl covered with a damp dishtowel when you are not working with it. You might find adding a small amount of additional water to the piece you are working with helping. The longer you knead the dough the better. I tried making 3-D bird ornaments but they ended up cracking as the outside dries long before the inside can. I made flat ones as well and that seems the only way to go. I cooked them at 200 F (it took several hours) and avoided puffing problems. I submitted photos of my finished product see additional comments on the one of the birds hanging in the tree. One last thing-- these are fragile! I broke off two of the tails-- but superglue works to put them back together.",
