Chicken Livers would never hold up under 4 hours on low or even warm in any slow-cooker...  but 45 min to an hour and DELISH! loved loved, loved this flavor. Served mine over buttered Parmesan Fettuccine and comfort food at it's best! next time I'm going to throw in a hand full of fresh spinich at the end..  home made rolls and butter on a cold snowing night in Illinois... So glad I tried this one! Could just as easily have been made on the stove top in a cast iron skillet...

It was really good and the basics were as written. Will definitely be making again. Mu husband and I love chicken livers and they're pretty inexpensive here because so many people don't like them.
