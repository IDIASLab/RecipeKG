I used instead one packet of the Good Seasons Italian All Natural Salad Dressing & Recipe Mix instead. These meatballs melt in your mouth. I had also added two slices of torn white bread soaked in milk squeezing the milk out of the bread then adding it to the meat mix. The meat was very moist and sticky so I had bowl of warm water to dip my hands to make the meatballs. Every other meatball recipe I tried was dry and had no taste this is wonderful. Full marks A++++.

My mom just praised them!  I made two different batches.  One with ground beef/pork mixed together (for boyfriend), and one with ground turkey (for my mom and I).  They were both tasty, moist and just plain delicious. The only difference in my opinion (I snuck a little taste of both), was that ground turkey meatballs seem to fall apart more and easier.  I used fresh grated Romano cheese (was what I had). I made some sauce on the side for those who wanted, but mostly everyone just wanted the meatballs all alone.  So with a salad and some garlic bread...it was a scrumptious dish.  Thanks. ",

I substituted sausage for 1/3 of the meat and cooked them as directed took them out of the pan and drained them then put them back in the pan. I mixed a can of regular cream of mushroom soup with a can of beefy mushroom soup (Campbell's) and a can of sliced mushrooms and then poured that over the meatballs and popped them back in the oven for about 15 minutes until the sauce was bubbly and brown around the edges. I served them over buttered egg noodles and my husband (clever wit that he is) said \"Wow these are delicious! Think you can remember how you made them?\"",
