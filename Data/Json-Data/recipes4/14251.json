I had no knowledge of this recipe going into making this dish (the ingredients just sounded unusual enough and I love a Cottage Pie) so I didn't know til after the fact that \"Pastelon\" is a lasagna w/ the plaintains as the noodle. (Otherwise I would've followed the recipe more accurately and cut them in lengths rather than in rounds.) I think the homemade sofrito is one of the things that really made this meal special. I took a big spoonful of the meat while it was simmering and thought I'd died and gone to heaven. As far as the layering of the dish went I used an 8X8 pyrex did 1/2 the plantains (again mine were fried in rounds) 3 eggs beaten w/ Adobo the full 1 lb. sofrito/meat 1 can green beans the remaining plantains (of which total I only used 2 -- next time I will definitely use more plantains and bonks self on head cut them correctly) and 3 more eggs beaten w/ Adobo. When I made the sofrito I had enough leftover to freeze about 5 ice cubes' worth for another night. And I'm already anxious for that other night to come b/c I plan on making Leticia's recipe again! (Btw my name's Ticia so that made this recipe stand out all the more.)",

Personally the secret is in the \"sofrito\". My mother usually makes sofrito in large batches and freezes it in ice cube trays. Once they're frozen she pops them into large ziplocs. This way you can use as little or as much as you'd like without fear of spoiling the batch. The plantains should be as ripe as possible & cut lengthwise for best results.

Also just out of habit when making puerto rican beef recipes I added about 1/2 cup tomato sauce to meat mixture and simmered on low for 30 minutes before layering. I honestly cant see me making this as written with 8 eggs..the 3 were enough for us.thanks for a great comforting dinner!",
