Last time I made brats I used the Beer Brats recipe from this site this recipe is 100 times better. The onions tasted great and the brats were delicious. The only thing I changed was browning them in a frying pan instead of grilling them. Will deinitely have the hubby grill them when I make them this summer but winters in Maine are not condusive to grilling. I will definitely be making this again!",
