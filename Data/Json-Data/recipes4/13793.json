Also, I increased the sauce a bit because I served over bowtie pasta and, well, let's face it ~ you can never have enough sauce!  I might ease back a tad on the salt next bime but my husband thought it was perfect as is.  This tasted like something you would get in a fine resturant, but was so simple and made with ingredients I had on hand.  Does life get better than this!?!",

I agree that capers would be good in place of olives and you could even add artichokes (non marinated kind).  I poured the whole thing over a box of farfalle and doubling the sauce would be good since the pasta soaked up a lot of the sauce.  I will make this again!  Thanks!",

Made this in the crock pot using frozen chicken tenders which also made this so easy! I did substitute a can of chopped tomatoes w/garlic & onion for the sun dried tomatoes and added a chopped red bell pepper and a can of artichokes. I also used a small jar of capers & the green olives but the olives definitely made the difference! I mixed everything but the chicken & artichokes together & then layered the chicken sauce & artichokes. Cooked on high 5 - 7 hours. Ladled it over bow tie pasta. Thanks for the recipe! This will be a great dish for potlucks and soooo easy!!",
