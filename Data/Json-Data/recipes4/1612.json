However, classics are classics for a reason, and this was tasty and easy. No complaints from me or my fiancee. Changes I made: I added 2 big cloves of crushed garlic to the sausage while it was cooking, some dried basil to the sauce, used a six-cheese sauce, used more sauce than called for (1 big jar), added grated fresh parmesan to the mozzarella on top, and used half gnocchi and half cheese tortellini. A quick, tasty, throw-together meal - I won't keep the recipe on hand because come on, you make this once, you have it memorized. But I'll remember it for busy weeknight dinners in the future.",

I used a Italian 4 cheese blend & 1 jar each Classico Roasted Garlic & Spicy Red Pepper. It gave it just the slightest bite, but wasn't too hot for my 10 year old. This recipe was so simple, but really, really good. We all ate until we were stuffed, so this is definately going into rotation. Thanks!",

I think gnocchi only needs a simple sauce and a light spinkle of parm. However my 13 month old really enjoyed it.",
