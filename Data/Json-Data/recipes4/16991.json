        "description": "I wanted a bread with some extra protein for breakfast, so I came up with this. This is an excellent very faintly sweet breakfast bread with an unusual but satisfyingly 'bread' texture. The crust has a great flaky/chewy consistency while remaining soft. It is dense but not heavy and the extra protein from the almond flour keeps the mid-morning munchies away. It is very good with a slice of cheese and some fruit on the side. This is not (nor was it intended to be) a gluten-free recipe; the addition of vital gluten is critical to maintain cell structure for the rise. The xanthan gum is only in there because I like the ability to slice my homemade bread and use it for sandwiches.",

Great loaf of bread with all the extra goodness and health benefits of almond flour and whole wheat. Thanks for the recipe!",

It's delightfully fluffy and just a tiny bit sweet. \n\nI did substitute sunflower oil for almond oil because I didn't have almond oil.  I suspect it didn't matter much; I can certainly recommend it with sunflower oil in any event.\n\nI might try it on the 1.5 lbs loaf setting on my bread machine the next time I make it.  It's just a little dark on the outside and it seems smaller than other two pound loafs I've made.",
