Trying to find nice \"pepper boats\" to hold the goodies was a challenge at the produce market but the meat mixture stayed together so nicely. I did not have all the salsa called for in the recipe so I used what I had mixed in the meat mixture then poured a small can of V-8 juice over all (my Romanian Grandma used to use this with her stuffed peppers and cabbage rolls). Sprinkled cheese on top at the very end of cooking time and what nice compliments from all! DO NOT PRECOOK THE MEAT. All the flavors meld together. Will be making this one again and again.",

I used small yellow orange and red peppers (appetizer style) 1lb of meat more salsa and instead of white rice I cooked up a mexican rice dish (you can get a package mix) and stole some from that and added cilantro to the mixture. The cooking time was also shortened by about 20 minutes. Will definitely make again and take to parties!",

When beef was cooked i added half of the salsa and let it simmer for a bit. Becasue everything was cooked I had to figure out a way to soften the peppers (as this would have happend over the hour they were in the oven). So I just boiled some water and tossed them in for around 3 minutes. After draining them I stuffed them put the rest of the salsa on top and heated them up for about 10-15 minutes. It was yummy. Maybe next time I'll try it the way the recipe says:)",
