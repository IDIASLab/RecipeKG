Like other reviewers, I used regular long-grain rice and it was nearly mushy even then.  I'm sure it also needs a bit of spice as there is none in the recipe at all.  \n\nMy package of chops had six in it, so I used them all.  I dusted the chops with flour before browning, although I didn't need to...that was force of habit, I hadn't realized the recipe didn't call for it and I'm sure it wasn't necessary.  I put a bit of salt and pepper on the chops while browning and sprinkled the browned chops with garlic salt in the baking pan.  \n\nI lightened it up a LOT, used FAT FREE cream of chicken and celery soup, SKIM milk and NO butter.  I was a little worried about that, but it came out creamy and rich tasting.  I just mixed the soups and milk in a bowl with a wisk - no cooking - added about a teaspoon and a half of ground rosemary, and a small can of mushrooms including liquid.  Then I stired the rice in - maybe slightly over 1 cup.  I did cook at about 275 or 300 degrees for about 2 hours.  It was terrific and will definately be in the regular meal rotation from now on!",

If you made it just as the recipe states I am sure it would be superb!  I added pepper, garlic powder to the pork chops while they were browning just to give them a little extra flavor.  Also I wanted to make sure the rice wouldn't get mushy so used 1 cup regular long grain rice instead of instant and I added an extra half can of cream of chicken soup and another 1/3rd cup of milk so there would be plenty of liquid for the rice.  We loved the rice that went along with the pork chops! Thank you for sharing!",

I did season the pork chops with salt, pepper & garlic powder before I browned them.  And I also added about a tablespoon of crushed rosemary into the rice, milk, soup mixture.  It was really good.  The rice was a bit mushy, but it's instant rice, of course it was going to be mushy.  I wonder if I use converted rice, would it hold up better??  Still very very good recipe.",

This makes a TON of rice so I would try to add one or two more pork chops in to help even out the leftovers. I would also do as some other reviewers have suggested and add some onion to the pan after you brown up the pork chops. For a recipe with such sodium heavy condensed soups I'm sad to say that it needs salt to improve it. I would also cut the butter in half. Mine pooled up in areas and just seemed excessive. One other note; I didn't have instant rice so I used regular long grain. I checked the dish about half way through to make sure there was still enough liquid since regular rice absorbs more than instant. I had to add about a cup of water but in retrospect I would maybe add chicken stock instead and at the beginning if you are using regular rice to add more flavor. On a good note my husband and 3 year old liked this as written but they aren t too adventurous.",
