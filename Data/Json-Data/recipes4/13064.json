It also isn't that minty, but 2 bunches of mint is a vague measurement.  Not sure what the recipe submitter really meant, so I looked it up.  A small bunch is about .5 oz (which is what I used), a larger bunch is 1 oz.  Perhaps what was meant was a large bunch?  At any rate, I made the Mint Ice Cubes on here (recipe by Skuba) and added it to my glass of tea. Although it took them a while to melt, once they did, it is a mint explosion!  thanks for the recipe.",
