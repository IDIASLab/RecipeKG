BUT, I just adjusted the seasonings to my taste, let it cook longer, and found it was a great meal.  I did follow the recipe exactly, except I only cooked it 2 hours before adding the flour/water mixture instead of 3.  \r\n\r\nI think it is a great \"base\" for a chili recipe.  I never have luck with my crockpot and all I had to do was add chipotle, liquid smoke, cayenne pepper, cumin, paprika and brown sugar.  If you are adding brown sugar I would cut back on the molasses, it was too syrupy.  Also, I would like to add a lot more beans to this...I would definitely use this as a start to developing my own personalized veggie chili recipe.",
