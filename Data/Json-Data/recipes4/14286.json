I often do the chicken in the slow cooker, and do the rest on the stove when I get home from work.  I can have this on the table in 30 minutes using this method.

I usually add tons more stuff to chicken and dumplings and made this as a faceless recipe for the AllRecipes Allstar faceless recipe challenge. I really loved it. I made it as written and I also made carrots potatoes onions celery thyme on the side cooked in the same broth. I really liked the original recipe the best (and we love veggies). This will be my go to chicken and dumpling recipe. I must say also that I have never fixed flat dumplings only the round ones. I had to get help from the Recipe Buzz but they showed me how to make the dumplings. (they should be rolled out to about 1/8th of an inch.) Thanks so much for posting the recipe.",
