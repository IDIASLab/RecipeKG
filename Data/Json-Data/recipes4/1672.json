Simply take a package of the Morningstar crumbled soymeat (defrosted) and add a bit more ketchup and evap milk to make it a sticky precooked consistency. I then zapped it with some Montreal steak seasoning in addition to the rest of the ingredients and slathered in cheese. Still yummy. THX",

Changed up the cooking method a bit for an experiment. Used about 6 small Italian hoagie buns split. Spread the meat mixture about a 1/2 inch thick on one side and then put the top back on. I then wrapped each individually in foil and baked 30 minutes in the 375 oven. To serve I cut each in half. Worked out faily well this way and kept the bun from getting too crunchy. My son liked them very much but my husband and I thought they we just ok...just seemed to be lacking something for me and my husband didn't like the soggy bread bits. My try again sometime.",
