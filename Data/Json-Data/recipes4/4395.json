I think I would have liked it better if I had just put the cheese on top and ONLY baked for thirty mins. It was a little mushy for my taste. I love a recipe that the kids love though will make again IT MAKES alot!!!! Do not be afraid of the wine lol it was good Update made as written just cooked in oven 30 mins ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! It is now on a weekly rotation. In a time crunch bought frozen tenders cooked and cut up then added to cooked pasta and sauce SO GOOD!!!!!!",

This is a little bit of work (but really not as much as you would think--this went quicker than I thought and I even had a gazillion things going on at the same time and was able to pull it of in under 45 minutes) and it does dirty a lot of dishes but the end result is worth it. The extra spices in the breading and the homemade marinara really made this dish extra special. My family yum-ed and mmmm-ed through the whole meal.",
