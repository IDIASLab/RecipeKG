At my supermarket you can buy bags of cleaned and chopped escarole - I start there.  In a large nonstick skillet add 3 TBLSs olive oil, and 5 cloves rough chopped garlic.  when the garlic is fragrant add escarole and toss with tongs for 3 minutes or so to cover each piece with  with garlic oil.   Add I can drained cannelinni, 2-3 cups chicken broth,   hot pepper flakes, oregano, and bring to a rapid boil over high heat.  Cook to reduce for 10 -15 minutes.  Turn off heat and sprinkle  liberally with fresh grated parm. cover and let stand  for a few minutes.  the 'sauce' is cheesy and and great for crusty-bread dipping.  we usually have this with spicy grilled chicken sausage.  Easy, fast, economical, healthy, and delicious.",
