Can't wait for an excuse to make it again.  The sauce turned out incredibly well and it baked beautifully.  The only thing I would change next time is to cover it for the first half of the cooking, as it got a little dry -- nothing major.\r\n\r\nThe only adjustment we made was to the types of cheeses.  We made it with 8 oz white cheddar, 8 oz sharp yellow cheddar, and about 4 oz of mozzerella for smoothness.  This blend of cheeses really had a nice bite to it.\r\n\r\nWill definitely be making this again.",

I made a few changes, including switching processed American cheese for Mozzarella and adding some crushed up crackers on top. I baked the dish covered for thirty minutes and then added the crackers and baked uncovered for 10 minutes. Also I used almost an entire 16 oz package of macaroni. With just 8 oz, it looked like cheese soup with some noodles in it. If you want your mac and cheese EXTREMELY creamy, I guess that's good. Even with almost 16 oz of pasta, the dish was still very creamy and not dry at all. I plan on making this for a graduation party we're having in a week and I'm very excited to see how it turns out. I plan on playing around with different measurements of both regular cheddar, sharp white cheddar, and mozzarella. This recipe is a great base for a delicious dish.\n\n-- Update: I baked this dish for our BBQ and it was a HIT! I doubled the recipe and even then it was all gone by the end of the party. This time I used (proportionally) 1/2 sharp white cheddar, 1/4 regular cheddar, and 1/4 mozzarella. It was amazing! I also doubled the pasta again this time. I used almost 32 ounces of pasta, leaving about enough out for a regular sized bowl of pasta (probably a couple ounces). Baked it for about 45 minutes covered, then took the top off, added crushed crackers, and baked for another 10 minutes. Man, I will be making this dish my whole life! It is so delicious!",

I had a 16 oz package of elbow macaroni, so to double the sauce, I used the same amount of flour but doubled the butter and added about 3/4 more cheese. I didn't bother slicing the American cheese into strips, just chunked it into the saucepan to melt. I also didn't use sharp cheddar since I'm pregnant and find sharp cheddar too greasy lately, but a shredded mild cheddar / monterey Jack mix did the trick. The finished product was a cheesy macaroni with a thick, creamy sauce. Although I didn't try it, I'm sure this recipe would be great with a bread crumb topping. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe! :)",
