Because I will not have pan drippings from a turkey, I needed a gravy recipe that didn't use drippings.  I followed the following tips:  1. I used Swanson's canned chicken broth (3, 14oz. cans equal 5 cups).  One of the cans I used Roasted Garlic chicken broth.  2.  I increased the flour by 2 Tablespoons, and added 2 Tablespoons of Corn Starch.  3.  I omitted the salt (and I like heavy salt).   There's enough saltiness with the broth.   Thanks JMOR777 for a terrific gravy recipe.  Merry Christmas everyone!",

Here's what  used/did, as I didn't have exactly the same ingredients: I browned the turkey neck and giblets in a sauce pot and added 5 cups of ckn broth, brought to a boil & took out the neck & giblets. I added a can of cream of ckn with herbs soup because that's what I had, and I really think it added a little something extra that made it that much better. I then added some garlic powder, onion powder, lots of fresh ground pepper, and some ground savory (herb). I added 1/4 cup of flour to 1 cup of warmed milk - I did that because I thought the 1/3 was a bit much, and I was right - 1/4 was more than enough. I slowly poured it into the gravy while whisking and it thickened up immediately. Because it was so thick (it wasn't paste or anything, but it was definitely more creamy than a gravy), I added tons of pan drippings to the finished gravy, which not only thinned it out a tiny bit, but added A TON of flavor! I did NOT add any salt - you really don't need it (and I LOVE salty food). This gravy was SO ridiculously easy and SO delicious... I'll be making this a regular staple when  make turkey or chicken. PS - this gravy is NOT enough for 28 people/servings. It makes a LOT of gravy, but if your family is anything like mine, then this is enough for about 2 dozen people. Again, just delicious!",

I don't stuff my turkey just so that I will have lots of juices from the turkey to make my gravy.  I fill the cavity of the turkey with chicken broth, and if it is a 20+ pound bird, I will pour in as much as 32 ounces of chicken broth.  When the turkey is done roasting some 4 hours later, I pour off all of the broth, which is A LOT, and I use this broth to make gravy and to pour over my dressing.  Adjust the flour and milk to thicken, adding more if you like a thicker gravy.  Also, if I have brined the turkey, I do not add salt.  A brined turkey gives wonderful broth, and the gravy is delicious.  Hope this helps with some of the issues people are having.",
