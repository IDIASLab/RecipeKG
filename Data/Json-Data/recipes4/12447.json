Added onions instead of celery into the legs. Mixed butter with sage, thyme, rosemary and bit of salt/ black pepper and put that between the meat/skin. I placed the legs in the pan, and sprinkled black pepper on top of skin. Poured 1 can of chicken broth in the pan and added baby carrots in the pan on the outside (love the taste), loosely cover with foil. And baked at 400 degrees instead of 350 (since I was using a small toaster oven - not the big oven, I was afraid that it wouldn't be hot enough) for 2 hours. About 1 hr 10 later, took out the foil and basted them occassionally. 30 min before taking it out, I sucked out a lot of the broth (using the baster) and used that for the gravy. This allowed for the skin to brown and crisp up. Served with potatoes, gravy and corn. It turned out good, meat broke off the bone cleanly and the skin was nicely brown and crispy. Next time I would probably keep the foil on there a bit longer and take it out a bit earlier probably 1 45 min instead of the full 2 hrs.",

                "reviewBody": "Use a variation of this recipe, time and time again.  I usually have to refer to this for the baking temperature.  I foil-line a cookie sheet and rinse the turkey legs off and pat dry.  I melt a little butter in a bowl in the microwave and brush it all over the legs and swipe some on the foil to prevent sticking.  I then salt the legs, sprinkle thyme, then pepper them lightly, flip to the other side and repeat, reapplying the butter if it looks like it needs it.  We prefer thyme on our turkey as opposed to other herbs like rosemary, as it can overpower the taste sometimes and we usually like something a little basic, but with flavor.  Generally, this finishes before the 2 hour mark in the oven and I always make my special mashed potatoes with it.  I remove the legs from the pan and scrape the drippings off the foil and put them into a pan, add about 1/2 cup (i don't measure) of milk and heat until the drippings blend well with the milk, THEN I add about a tablespoon of flour and simmer until blended and desired thickness (usually a minute or 2).  Turkey drippings make THE best gravy, no seasonings needed, it's already there.  Serve with another side like green beans or whatever I have on hand.  AWESOME.  Simple & fool-proof.",

The first time I did not have any celery so I used slivered onions instead (very tasty).  But last Sunday when I did have some celery I tried it again and OMG!  The flavor those stalks put out was superb!  I thought that the celery would be mushy and it was not.  If was soft yet still had a firm feel when eaten.  I seasoned my turkey with salt, pepper, garlic powder and a little parsley (for color).  My meat was tender, juicy and fell right off the bone!  We had with greens (with turkey necks), mac-n-cheese and cornbread (I uploaded a pic.  I had to stop eating in order to actually take the picture. LOL).  I will DEFINITELY cook my turkey legs this way from now on.  I've shared with friends and they too enjoyed the recipe.  Reminds me of the food my grandmother would cook everyday.
