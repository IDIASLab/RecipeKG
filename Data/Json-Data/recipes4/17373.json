The recipe should read \"remove chicken to a plate add water and sauce to skillet.\" However I added a bit of garlic salt to the chicken before coating it in the cheese/herb mix and just quickly browned the outside. Then I kept the chicken in the pan to finish cooking with the sauce and pasta. Nice and easy and fewer dishes. Tip: 2.5 cups of water equals a jarful. I'd probably make it again.",
