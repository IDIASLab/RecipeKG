This is definitely a quick fix and don't be fooled into thinking you must have all the ingredients - experiment a little!  \n\nMy recommendations for improvemnent:  Don't use the recommended pasta.  Try using a very small amount of fideo pasta (it plumps and absorbs a lot, so use sparingly to avoid a stew like texture) or you can also try 1/2 - 2/3 cup of mini macaroni (salad macaroni).  The fideo and mini macaroni can be added directly to the soup during the last 20-25 minutes of simmer time.  This elimates the need to cook the pasta separately.  Also, omit the salt.  Substitute chicken (or beef) broth/bouillon cubes instead of the water.  I used 3 cups chicken stock (bouillon) and 2 cups water (which is why I omitted the salt).  I also substituted one 15oz can diced tomatoes and one 15oz can of tomato sauce instead - definitely worth this alteration!  I didn't have navy beans so I used a can of chickpeas instead.  \n\nBe generous with the parmesean cheese - put about a generous 1/2 cup portion instead - this helped with the overall flavor!  \n\nI've made it a few times now and each time it tastes better than the last - especially with the minor adjustments!  Thanks for a great starter recipe!",

I've tried a lot of pasta e fagioli recipes, and none of them have tasted like what I remember eating in Italy as a child--until now.  I didn't experience excessive thickening of the soup, but I did cook it with a lid on.  I do recommend doing this.  It is very thick the next day, but this is expected with bean-based soups, and does fine with a little water added.  Thank you for the recipe!",

I\u2019m 67 years old and yes, Italian also (which doesn\u2019t make me an authority)! I have been making my variation of Pasta Fagioli for a long time and I always use celery. For a reviewer to make such a broad statement that celery or carrots are NEVER in Pasta Fagioli, is just wrong. If you like celery or carrots in your Pasta Fagioli, by all means USE THEM! This is a peasant or farmers type meal and they had to use what they had on hand. Yes this is basically a bean and pasta soup without meat, although there are authentic recipes that use Pancetta (Italian bacon), obviously from peasants with more Lira than the average peasant\u2026 lol\u2026 so if you want meat USE IT! After all, you\u2019re cooking to please yourself and your family. If you check Lidia Matticchio Bastianich\u2019s recipe, (from Lydia\u2019s Italy on PBS) her recipe has potatoes, carrots and ham hocks in it. So you see, as with any recipe, there are probably as many variations as there are cooks, and all recipes are authentic to each individual cook. Experiment and cook to satisfy yourself, that\u2019s what makes cooking fun and exciting! Mangia!",

Added a bit of crushed red pepper for some kick some crumbled cooked bacon and served w/ grated asiago cheese. ALSO cook the pasta separately and run cold water on and allow to cool before adding to soup so it doesnt absorb all of the broth!! Great w/ crusty bread and salad.",

I made a few adjustments based on the reviews...I added bite-sized carrots and celery to the onion as it was cooking.  I added a 14.5 oz can of petite diced tomatoes, and used 3 cans of beans: 2 red kidney beans and 1 can of great northern beans (comparable to the other white beans called for in the recipe).  I used less olive oil to cook the onion, and romano rather than parmesean cheese.  I also only used 4 cups of liquid: 2 cups of water and 2 of chicken broth.  I think next time I'll use the full 5 1/2 cups of liquid, as my husband thought the broth was just a bit too tomatoey.  I thought it was great, and I'll definitely make it again.  I served it with the Garden Herb loaf from this site, which is a hearty, chewy bread and a great companion for this soup.",
