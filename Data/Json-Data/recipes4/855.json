So Texas \"Invented\" Chili and \"there's no beans under any circumstances in chili, ever\".  WOOPEE. As far as Ive ever been concerned, why would you ever want to eat one of those \"Chili Cook Off\" chilis that is nothing more than a soupy gruel.  Chili should be a hearty meal with some substance like beans, onions, peppers, and whatever else one cares to put in! Anyways, good job, great flavor and thank you.",
