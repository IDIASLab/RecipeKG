For close to 20 years I have been searching for a decent Cincy chili recipe to no avail...until I found this one! I did augment the recipe to make it more like Gold Stars. (Skyline is more \"earthy\" than I like) I added hot water every 1/2 hour or so- maybe 1/2 cup every time to mellow it out and keep it from getting too thick. I also added ~ 2 teaspoons of light brown sugar, 1 teaspoon cardamom, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves. The result was more like Gold Star's chili recipe which is my preference. Thank you for posting this recipe...it quells my craving at least until I make the trip back home to Cincinnati!",

                "reviewBody": "Having lived most all of my life in the Cincinnati area I am very familiar with the Cincy style chili. Skyline Chili was my chili of choice. For a long time I have hoped for a recipe which would replicate this area favorite. Well with this recipe I think my search has finally ended. I followed the recipe as outlined except using allspice powder instead of berries and unsweetened cocoa powder instead of chocolate squares. I didn't overnight the beef in the fridge after cooking. I just carefully skimmed the fat from the top after giving it time to separate from the water. Giving it a taste a couple of hours into the cooking I gave it a shake or two more of chili powder and a couple more pinches of allspice. And that was it. After the three hours of cooking and boiling a pot of spaghetti I sat down to the truest reproduction of the \"real thing\" as I have ever had. If you try this recipe be patient. You need the whole three hours of cooking to fully merge all of the flavors and to get that true Cincinnati Chili taste. As the recipe noted might be necessary I had to occasionally add a little water during simmering to keep the consistency and to prevent it from sticking. If you do these things you will be rewarded for your efforts. We priced a container of Skyline while in the grocery today and it was a staggering 6.89!! Never again will we have to spend this outrageous price for a great local chili taste. Many many thanks for this recipe.",

And the part that's better?  Since you skim the fat, your leftovers don't have a thick orange layer on top when they come out of the fridge!  There's no point in using lean ground beef since you'll boil the fat out so just buy the cheapest one.  Enjoy!",
