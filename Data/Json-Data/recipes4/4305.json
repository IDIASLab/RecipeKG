I tried to make it tonight following the recipe but I realize that I probably put double the spices on the chicken.  I just sprinkle a healthy dose of curry, and then follow with about twice as much garam masala.  If the sauce gets too low and we're having rice, I add another 1/2 cup wine and the rest of the can of broth (a little more than half).  You can also buy one of the little bottles of wine and use that in the recipe instead of measuring.  They are a little over 1/2 cp.  Finally, at the end of cooking, I remove the chicken and bring the sauce to a hard boil for about 5 minutes until it is reduced.  I don't know why that instruction didn't make it into the published version.  Others have commented that they like it spicier and by all means bring out your spicy curry and red pepper if thats what you want.  But I posted this recipe as something that children will eat while still keeping their more adventurous parents happy.  I hope you all continue to enjoy this recipe.  Its great features are that is quick, cheap, and has few ingredients.  Enjoy!",

As I have 5 different jars of curry powder in my pantry, I felt I was taking a risk on this but chose well I think.  Second, I used regular chicken broth instead of the low sodium and it still did not have enough salt.  Simply add salt for more flavor.  I spiced it up with a half teaspoon of extra spicy indian chili powder.  This gave it a much needed kick.  I also added a bit of flour mixed with water to thicken the gravy up some.  Pour it over short grain brown rice and its awesome.  Enough for four meals given a side.  I'm definitely adding this one to my standard recipe list.",

For the last 10 minutes of simmering I took the cover off the pan and allowed the broth/wine/vinegar mixture to reduce to a creamy glaze which I served over the chicken. We paired this with a cool salad to offset the heat for a delicious low-carb dinner!",
