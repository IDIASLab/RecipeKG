There was NO WAY I was going to put 1 AND 1/3 cups oil into the mix. I put about 1/3 cup and that was plenty. I also added walnuts and/or pecans- about a cup to a cup and a half. Finally, I only cook the cake for 30 minutes. Before the cake has a chance to cool, it is gobbled up every time. I've made this several times now and everyone who has tried it absolutely RAVES about how good it is.   Super Easy and Everyone Will Love You! It's also delicious if you use a chocolate cake mix as the base. Yum.",

It is definately more like cake than banana bread. Banana bread is much more dense... the way I like it. I also only put in only 1 cup of oil and it did fine... maybe 3/4 cup next time. I ended up baking the loafs for about 45-50 minutes. Thanks!",
