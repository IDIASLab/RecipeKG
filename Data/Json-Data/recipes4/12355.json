This recipe was perfect. All the ingredients were already in my house. I used the ham which I chopped finely with my food processor. The only thing is betweem the saltiness of the ham and chedder cheese this really doesn't need the additional saly. Skip it or it gets too salty. Overall a great way to use the leftover ham one that even the kids will love!",

Either way I found this recipe. I used 1 slice of pre-cooked Smithfield hardwood smoked center cut slice and shredded it. It is more similar to the ham used at the restaurants anyway. And I have never eaten them made with ham lunch meat. I got 24 golf ball sized croquettes which I shaped into little football shaped ovals like the restaurants. When I re-heat I might serve with a white or bechamel sauce like I remember as a kid with a little chopped parsley for garnish. And they are good with mashed potatoes and southern vegetables as a side. I think I will make this every Easter with some of that leftover fresh ham. Thank you submitter.",

However the 2nd time after I finely chopped the ham & added the veggies bread crumbs & eggs I used a hand blender to give it that final \"paste-like\" texture before dredging & frying. It came out way better like this I think. I chose to omit the cheese this time as well-just because we didn't feel like it & it still turned out great. Thanks for the great recipe!",

These were basically bread croquettes with a little ham in them. I know that a filler is necessary in a croquette but this was just way too much. In recipes like these I find that the cheese flavor can get lost and this was definitely the case here where the cheese had a lot of bread to compete with. I also didn't care for the garlic powder.",
