I used about 20 oz. of 7up...and it turned out very well. I wasn't sure if I'd like the citrusy-sweet flavor of the soda in a pot roast, especially the gravy, but I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious taste! The meat was so tender as well...it almost melted in my mouth. I did cook it on high...for about 6-7 hours. It turned out absolutely fabulous, and my family loved it! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe...I'll be making it again!!!",
