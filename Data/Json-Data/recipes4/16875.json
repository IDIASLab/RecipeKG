                "reviewBody": "This was pretty good. I was looking for a quick bread to go with our soup besides my usual go-to sourdough biscuits and this did the trick. I almost rated this at 3 stars however because of the lack of important details in the directions. The directions don't tell you to flatten the dough at all which is quite essential information! I could tell from the type of recipe and the photo that the dough needed to be flattened before cooking so I did but someone who is a cooking novice might not know that and just do what the directions say: To form dough into a ball with your hands and then move on to frying. If left in ball form I think it would be VERY difficult to fully cook the bread in the middle without burning the outside since I had a hard enough time with that even with flattened dough. And since the recipe didn't say to flatten the dough at all I had to guess at how thick to make the pieces and didn't guess overly well. I flattened to about 1/4-3/8\" or so each but the dough rose while cooking to about twice that so as I mentioned I had a hard time getting the bread cooked in the middle without burning the outside. I would start with thinner dough next time to get a more golden exterior with a non-doughy middle. All that said these were pretty tasty and quick to make so I will probably try it again with those changes. I think they would also make a yummy doughnut-like dessert treat rolled in powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar after frying.",
