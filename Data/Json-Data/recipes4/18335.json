I did make two minor changes:  calrose rice rather than jasmine and orange bell peppers rather than green---both personal preferences (you fix what your husband will eat---lol).  I made my own creole mix from a recipe on this site, and I'll have to go back and add more of the cayenne to the mix because I was going a little cautious on that one.  I also added some of that seasoning to the sauce.  I would definitely make this again!  Thanks, Nikki!",
