I wasn't too sure about the topping flavor before putting it on the salmon (the vinegar seemed overpowering), but it turned out amazing. The topping caramelizes with nice crispy edges. So good! I cooked the fish for 12 minutes and that was perfect for me - nice and juicy! I served it over garam masala-scented rice and roasted brussel sprouts. I can't wait to make this for company! Thanks Health Nut!",

The rest of the ingredients were chopped & blended in my nifty hand cord-pulled Tupperware processor. Followed the directions as written and it was a tasty dish that we'll make regularly.",
