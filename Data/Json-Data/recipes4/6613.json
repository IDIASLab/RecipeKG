                "reviewBody": "This just didn t work out exceptionally well. Made as written except for subbing dry for unavailable fresh oregano. It took about 15 minutes more bake time to soften the eggplant rounds toward the center of casserole. I guess the 2 globe eggplants selected were x-large (vs. large per recipe) as the casserole dish was filled to the brim with enough leftover to do another layer. With more than a dozen eggplant varieties in substantially different sizes and shapes expressing in pounds rather than quantity would help yield more consistency in the end result. I m giving this the best rating of several eaters which ranged from 2 - 4. Two things to consider... eggplant releases water as it cooks and following instructions to not drain liquid from the canned diced tomatoes and jar of marinated artichokes creates a wet casserole. Spooning in some liquid presumably yields more flavor but no need to have the eggplant swimming in it. Generally we prefer leaving the skin on eggplant since it s the most nutritious part of the fruit. In this recipe I would skin them to get a more uniform texture across the entire casserole as the less cooked rounds toward the center were a bit tough while the flesh of the ones around the edges were on the mushy side. Alternatively breading and baking (or frying) the eggplant (like eggplant Parmesan) would yield uniform consistency and a more tasty casserole but represents a major change from the way this is written.",

I only used one eggplant instead of two. Ratio wise that was perfect for the rest of the ingredients. I baked the eggplant for 20 minutes on a cookie sheet then layered into the casserole dish. I did drain the artichokes. I omitted nuts and used dried herbs. I mixed the herbs/garlic into the sauce. I wish that I had diced the onion lightly saut\u00e9ed it and mixed it into the sauce as well. It tasted great and was perfectly cooked the way I made it.",
