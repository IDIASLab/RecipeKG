One thing you should try is to squeeze the citrus slices over the fish after it's cooked. It really added a punch to the flavor! I also had to make a modified lemon pepper because I didn't have any. I used lemon and lime zest and pepper but I think I needed salt too. All in all it was great! I'll use this cooking method for fresh fish again it came out better than any I've ever made!

Even with the parchment paper the result was a dry and somewhat tough fish. The second time I cooked the fish for 15 minutes the time stated in the recipe. What a difference! The fish was incredibly tender and juicy! The blood orange lemon lime and fresh dill provided a wonderful subtle flavor. Other times I used dry dill from McCormick and a standard Florida orange due to the unavailability of fresh dill and blood oranges. Even with these ingredients I found the salmon still had an incredible amount of flavor. I can confidently say this is the best salmon I ever had! This was also the first time I ever used a blood orange. I was shocked to see after slicing the orange a purple color not the familiar orange. Instead of throwing out the orange I did a Google search for blood oranges and discovered this is a normal color. I ate the left over blood orange and was pleasantly surprised by its exquisitely wonderful flavor. I also learned blood oranges are more popular in Europe than in the United States. I only found the blood orange available during the winter/spring. Bottom line I highly recommend this recipe!",

I followed the recipe except added sea salt in addition to the lemon pepper seasoning. I love fresh ground sea salt with all of my fish recipes! This was no exception - it really brought out the flavor of the salmon. I loved using the parchment paper - made the salmon so tender and juicy! This is an awesome recipe to add to summer dinners! I added roasted red potatoes and sauteed asparagus as side dishes. I also poured the juices left over in the parchment paper over the salmon and we used fresh sliced french bread to dip in the juice - yummy!",
