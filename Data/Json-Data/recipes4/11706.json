Took it out and it was a tougher consistency--like grd turkey or beef.  Added fresh minced garlic (3 cloves), added some red and green bell peppers with the onions and celery.  Didn't have corn on hand. I chopped up some carrots very finely diced and threw that in the pot too.  I sauteed all the veggies for a while in some EVOO to get it nice a soft yet crunchy.  You don't have to brown the tofu, just mix it spices.  I added more chili spice (probably tripled it), added a dash of hot sauce, a dash of garlic powder, freshly ground black pepper and a hint of mrs dash hot and spicy.  Didn't want it too spicy but enough flair to go on.  Mixed all that up in the tofu.  It won't change any color...so if seeing the white bothers you, try marinating it in some tomato sauce or something.  I didn't care it was white.  Poured the tofu in the pot and let it boil for  bit 5-8 min and then simmered.  I didn't cook it for the time stating (1 hr).  Thought that'd be too long, plus I needed a meal quick.  Served this with turkey hotdogs for the family.  MMMM mmm mmm .  Leftovers the next day are superb!  Try this recipe.. simple.",
