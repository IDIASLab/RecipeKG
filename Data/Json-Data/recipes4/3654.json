The final product for this recipe is just as good if not better than the stuff you get at the grocery store, but after making it twice, I discovered a couple things that really help the mixing process.  \r\n\r\nFirst, the suggested serving size in this recipe is about 1T, and I'm not aware of anyone who doesn't put at least 2T in each glass they make, so consider that when estimating the serving number you want to make (and remember, the batter is fantastic kept frozen, so go ahead and make extra!).  I used the serving size calculator to adjust it to 45 servings (and there are only 3 people in our home).  This # of servings allows you to use an entire 2lb bag of powdered sugar so there's less mess - no measuring needed. At 45 svgs, it then calls for 7.5 eggs - I used 6 large eggs, and 2 small ones to make that work.  The completed batch nicely fills a 1/2 gallon container which I keep in the freezer during Christmastime.  For mixing, you will find much less mess if you mix egg whites, and mix the yolks.  Then add yolks to butter, plus vanilla, then add the whites, and THEN add the sugar.  After all mixed, add spices at the end.  This eliminates the cloud of powdered sugar floating around your kitchen, as there is more liquid to help soak it all up.  I'm sure there may be a reason for the suggested order, but I've found this sequence a much less messy process.  :-) \r\n\r\nEnjoy!!",

I used the calculate button and changed it to 6 servings. 1/4 lb of powdered sugar is equal to 1 cup and 1 1/2 oz of butter is equal to 1 1/2 Tblsp. The only change I made was just doing a sprinkle of the cloves because I don't care for that spice as it is so strong. I tried it with cocoa and it made it a little more creamy and gave it a slight warm Christmas spice flavor. I then tried it with milk as seems is traditional and it was completely different tasting. It tasted like a thinner warm eggnog actually better to me than traditional eggnog as it was less thick. I can see how this is a winter holiday drink.",
