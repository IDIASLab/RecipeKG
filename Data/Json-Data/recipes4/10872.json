In a separate pan, I browned the meat, onions, some red bell pepper and garlic, along w/ garlic powder & onion powder.  When that was done, I drained the fat & added the browned potatoes.  then I added about 1/2 pkg. of Lipton onion soup and maybe a third cup of water and cooked a little longer.  Delicious! I served corn on the side, but you could add that as well. This did not have a gravy to it, but tasted sooo good.",

After reading through the reviews and looking at the submitted photo's I realize technique and expectation varies widely. Some are adding thickeners to make a gravy and describe it as stew like when I was after something like popping a can of hash.  I diced the the potato and onion very small for starters and left some of the fat after browning the beef and onion. I brought it to a low simmer and stirred occasionally, uncovered, until all the liquid was gone and it started to brown a little (took about an hour). I refrigerated it overnight and in the morning made patties and pan fried them in a bit of olive oil until crusty on both sides, but soft in the middle. Absolutely delicious topped with a couple eggs.",
