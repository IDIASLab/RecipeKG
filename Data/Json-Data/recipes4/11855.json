Scooped the pork out of the pot and sauteed the onions leeks garlic and cabbage in butter for 5-7 minutes then deglazed them with a lager style beer. Let that cook off for a minute and then added a mixture of chicken and beef broth. I omitted the green pepper as I felt it threw off the beautiful balance between the cabbage family and the lily family. Added frozen broccoli and cauliflower brussel sprouts and spinach to the mixture as I was adding the pork back in. Dropped the potatoes in within the last 30 minutes of cooking they gave it a really creamy consistency. Served this with a nice crusty French bread and lots of butter as I felt I got my vegetable quota in with this stew YUM! Thank you Colleen for sharing your recipe.",

I had a meaty bone-in piece of pork so I used that- Browned in some hot oil then removed. Next I tossed in a big spoon of butter with the oil and sauteed the green onions leeks onions cabbage and garlic until soft and fragrant. I then added some finely chopped broccoli and cauliflower (omitted the Brussels sprouts for lack of room- I need to invest in a stock pot!). I also omitted the green pepper as it seemed out of place (I did have it on hand though). Then added 2 cups of Molson M beer the rest water 2 cubes of bouillon (one chicken one beef) then the seasonings. I definitely at least doubled the seasonings and added some marjoram & chili flakes. Near the end I added in the potatoes; this added \"creaminess\" to the soup. spinach would make a nice addition too if you have some on hand. This dish can hold its own no bread necessary. Will be a repeat this winter that's for sure!",

My tweaks: (1) used cooked and \"de-boned\" boned-in pork chops rather than boneless pork loin (what I had on hand); (2) used 2 white potatoes and 2 red potatoes quartered but unskinned (again what I had on hand); (3) exchanged 2 carrots for the green pepper (family preference); (4) included 1 yellow onion to the leeks and scallions (green onions); (5) added 1/4 tsp. Sage (family preference) to the herb mix; and (6) tossed 4 chicken boullion into the pot as it cooked. I also \"garnished\" each serving with a slice of American cheese and set out our Parmesan/Romano mix fo;r who might want. A TOTAL success: really great flavor; wonderful texture.
