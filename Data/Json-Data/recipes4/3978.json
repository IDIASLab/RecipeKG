I think the wine gave it an even greater depth of flavor...mmmm. As this made more filling than was needed I baked the extra in a square casserole dish topped with a little extra parmesan. It cooked right alongside the sheet of zucchini and I served the extra as a heaping spoonful on top of angel hair spaghetti. Rave reviews! Definitely will make again.",
