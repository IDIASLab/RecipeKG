I took two cans of turkey chili and beans from Trader Joe's and poured them into a 9x13 oblong baking dish sprayed with pam. Then I sprinkled two kinds of cheese over the chili.\nIn a bowl, I mixed one box of Jiffy Cornbread mix with one egg, and added 1 can of creamed corn and about a quarter cup of milk. I mixed it up and poured it over the chili and cheese. I put it in a 375 degree oven for 45 minutes. Took it out and put more cheese on the top, put the foil back on for 10 minutes. \nI served this with sour cream, olives, and Pace picante sauce. It is a family family fave now.
