This would be equally good made with chicken and make sure you only use the 6 oz of pasta or you will have a dry casserole. I broke pasta in half for a smaller bite. I used buttered bread crumbs per personal preference. I also used a dry sherry. This is a very good and easy anytime dish. I also want to mention this says it's 6 servings. I believe it is 3 maybe 4.

My mother always put parmesan in her tetrazzini, so I added some and that helped...  I think onion or a bit of garlic added to the sauteed veggies would help.  I will say that the sauce was the right consistency and the pasta/sauce ratio was very good.",

The only change (mistake) I made was to use a whole pound of angel hair pasta, as it seemed like too much sauce for just 6oz. of pasta, and that didn't work out so great, lol. The pasta ended up dry, but it was still delicious. I didn't mind it b/c I like my pasta a bit drier, but hubby and the little guy wanted more sauce, so next time I will follow the recipe as is. This was very easy to make and had wonderful flavor...This is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",
