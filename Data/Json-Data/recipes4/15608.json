Otherwise we followed the recipe as written and it came out with great results. This is the kind of recipe that you can vary slightly to adapt to your needs and taste. We substituted the water with the juice of the chopped clams. This added to the flavor. Thanks for a great recipe. Will make again.",

Doubled the garlic and spices because too tomato-y without it. Put a bay leaf in too. Also used fresh basil and garlic and oh my god did my house smell amazing. Warning: don't cook the shrimp and calamari together calamari cooks much faster than shrimp and you will be left with overcooked calamari. Next time I will boil the shrimp and use the stock from that instead of the water. I cooked my clams and mussels before hand but according to my friend if i had just put them in there when it was boiling and closed the lid they would have opened right up....might have given a better flavor to the dish because I tasted the water from the boiling of the clams and mussels and it was briney-deliciousness. Overall it was great! Just tweet it to your families tastes. Made for a bunch of people and it was a hit!",
