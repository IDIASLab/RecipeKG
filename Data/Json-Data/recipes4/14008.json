No gravy mix so I used onion soup mix and a can of cream of mushroom soup. No turnip so I used a can of diced tomatoes - Italian style. I also used a bag of frozen stew vegetables instead of fresh. Because there was no gravy mix I had to thicken it up with a bit of flour and cold water which worked out great! Made the Bisquick dumplings to accompany and it was DELISH! There is no need for any other stew recipe IMO.",

I also added about half a cu of Merlot wine. I used all the other ingredients as given and it was excellent. My problem is with the dumplings but maybe I jut don't understand dumplings. The recipe doesn't say how big the spoonfulls should be. Mine turned out gummy and tasted of flour. I tossed them out and served mashed potatos on the side. We enjoyed the stew just as well.",

Also coat them in flour and pepper first; the flour cooks off and helps thicken the stew later so you don't need gravy powder. Cook some mushrooms in more butter until they brown with bay leaf thyme pepper and whole cloves add onions and root veggies (parsnips are awesome) fresh green beans then a bunch of red wine to deglaze the brown bits off then the stock. Simmer for 2 to infinity hours. I love beef stew!!",
