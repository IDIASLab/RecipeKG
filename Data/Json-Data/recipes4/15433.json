I add 1/4 cup brown sugar and an egg, use whatever juice I have on hand (have used pineapple, apple and orange) instead of water, and add 1/2 tsp allspice. I throw in a handful of walnuts with the cranberries. It is now the most requested bread in my household. The bread does dry out kinda quick but thats ok because it also makes the best bread pudding you'll ever taste!",

I do not like the way my bread machine bakes so I removed the bread placed in greased loaf pan and baked at 350 for 35 min.
