But I kept adding quite a bit of mayonnaise about 1 tsp sesame oil more garlic and about 1 Tbsp very finely minced fresh ginger. So in the end I am afraid I completely changed the recipe but made it more appropriate for our tastes. I used it as a dip for toasted ravioli which is also on this site and it was a nice compliment. Thank you Laurieloo for posting this recipe.",
