Be aware that although the texture is nice and moist it does crumb significantly when cut. When we just couldn't eat it fast enough to keep it from getting stale I took those leftover pieces that weren't fresh anymore and gave them new life in the Bread Pudding II recipe from this site. Wow! That was the best bread pudding I've ever eaten. No matter what you use this for it could not possibly be better.",
