Here were the changes I made: I steamed my rice, tried almonds instead of peanuts first and then tried peanuts and my husband and I both prefered ground almonds instead.  Added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper because we love it spicy! Used 3/4 tsp of ground ginger.  Used a good amount of salt and left out the cilantro, but I'm sure this would be an excellent garnish but didn't have it on hand.  Made this with cajun snapper.  Will cook this many more times.

The rice turned out a lovely golden colour and the veggys looked like confetti - quite pretty.  I might cut the cayenne in half next time because hubby likes things very mild, but if you like quite a bit of zing use the whole amount.  I almost went right past this recipe because the title \"carrot Rice\" doesn't sound like anything special but when I couldn't find any other recipes that had ingredients I had on hand, I gave it a try - it's a keeper - thanks for sharing",

I put a bit too much cayenne in for him, but it is never too spicy for me. You can make it as spicy or mild as you want. I also added about 3/4 cup of chicken broth to the carrot mixture to moisten. Also, be sure to actually let the mixture steam completely for at least the 5 minutes to marry the flavors and soften the veggies. I am making this dish again for a dinner party this superbowl weekend. Thanks so much!!",
