I used others suggestion & rubbed the spices on the roast which I think brought out flavor more than just mixed in with the mushrooms. I baked the loin at 350 for about 75 min & it was very juicy, but cooked more than we would usually do.  When I took the meat thermometer to the meat it was up to 160 & still rising. Next time I'll bake at 350 for an hour and see how that is. If the directions weren't so wordy where I wouldn't lose my place in what I was doing the recipe would've probably gotten a 5 star.
