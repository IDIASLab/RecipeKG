It's 10x better than using canned frosting. Although I couldn't really taste the coffee. It tasted like a good rich chocolate frosting. The color was like a milk chocolate. I thought it tasted a lot like a frosting version of fudge. It is really sweet but that is to be expected. Maybe a lightly sweet shortbread type cookie would work.
