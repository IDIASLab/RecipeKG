To that I added the items as instructed with the addition of 1/2 C of shredded carrot 2t of minced garlic 1 bag of Kraft bacon bits and about 1/4t of pepper. Also I added more water than what was called for bringing the total to about 3 C. After the potatoes were cooked soft I used a hand masher and mashed them coarsely in the pan. Now I don't know how it would have turned out if I would have followed the recipe as written but it was really excellant with the revisions.",

I used half-and-half instead of cream and threw in a bit extra so that it would have the creamy consistency I liked (less fat too). I also used a bit of leftover Velveeta cheese from the \"deluxe macaroni\" packages. The verdict? You can't get better than this. I was pleasantly shocked (and VERY filled - this soup WILL fill you up a bit of bread and this is just right for dinner). Think I'll try adding a bit of diced ham next time. Wonderful soup.

This is what I would suggest for improvement: (1) Use Half & Half instead of cream - it was a little too rich with the heavy cream (2) Add sauteed onions/green onions and bacon for extra flavor (3) Very lightly mash the potatoes before adding the cream/half & half - this gave the potatoes a more uniform appearance since you're using both an au gratin mix (slices)and Yukon Golds (cubed) (4) Season to taste - I used salt & black pepper and a little bit of cayenne pepper (5) Garnish with grated cheese crumbled bacon and green onions.",
