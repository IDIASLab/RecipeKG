Its more of a curried empanada rather than the spicy beef patties that Jamaica & the Bahamas are known for.\n\nReduce the curry in the dough and add a bit of saffron. In the meat filling, use the red curry, not the yellow. The red curry is the hotter curry and that is what gives the patties the 'bite' that island food is known for. Add a bit of finely chopped onion to the meat when cooking. Also, cooking the meat with a bit of jalape\u00f1o is done sometimes as well and then when thoroughly cooked, the jalape\u00f1o is discarded or pulsed with the meat before being sealed within the pastry.\n\nLastly, the pastry recipe definitely needs to be doubled to yield 10 normal sized patties.\n\nThis is a great starter recipe and one worthy of being in your box as it leaves all kinds of filling experiemntations open to the imagination.",

I now live in Japan, so naturally, the one thing I missed the most are beef patties ( especially the spicy ones ).  This recipe is EXCEPTIONAL!  However, I made some changes :\n\n- I doubled the amount of spice in the meat mix.  I also added Allspice, CLOVES ( very important in Jamaican cooking ), nutmeg to it.\n\n- I froze the margarine and shortening before cutting it in the flour.  I also put very cold water in the dough.  I then put the dough in the fridge for a good 30 mins before handling it ( which I made sure, to handle as little as possible ).\n\n- I added turmeric ( saffron ) to the dough, to give the pastry that yellow, buttery colour.\n\n- I also made sure that I cooled the meat, so as not to steam or change the pastry in any way, when I am stuffing them.\n",

I knew the meat mixture would need some additions to suit our tastes - so I added the following:\n\n1 large diced yukon gold potato\n1 diced green bell pepper\n1 large carrot - shredded\n\nAs for spice - I found it pretty vital to add 1/8 tsp of ground cloves and 1 tsp of sugar. This gave them the warmth aromatic flavor that makes Jamaican cuisine so distinctive.\n\nI also doubled the dough recipe as many others suggested - which yeilded 10 traditional sized patties.\n\nI love this because I can make half spicy for my husband and leave the rest for the kids and I. \n\nGreat recipe!!

Add the fats to the flour/salt mix and pulse for a minute or two until crumbly. Then add the cold water and pulse until a dough forms. Then you can roll it out. To go with it I mix a tad bit of premade salsa into about a cupful of sour cream. I also make a mango/apple salsa with mango apple orange juice cilantro bell pepper and red onion.

They're really good, and not that difficult to make.  Since some other reviewers complained about dryness, I just eyeballed the amount of broth and bread crumbs until it seemed like the meat mixture was moist enough.  I was concerned that the pastries might stick to the baking sheet since it didn't say to grease it, but they did not.  I loved the flakiness of the pastry and the curry in it, and I would not advise substituting store bought pie crust for it as others have suggested.  I also found the pastry to be easy to handle.  I halved the recipe because there are only two of us, and I wish I hadn't.",
