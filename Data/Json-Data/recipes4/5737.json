I cut the recipe in 1/2 for just my husband and I and it was plenty. I didn't have heavy whipping cream but I didn't let that stop me - I used 1/2% milk, which I had on hand. I am more of a savory type of gal and didn't use the cane syrup but instead sprinkled the fritters with salt. These turned out nice and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The corn lent the perfect amount of sweetness for us to this recipe. They are best right out of the pan - if they sit they will soften fairly quickly but will still be tasty.  Three ears of corn measures 1-1/2 cups of kernels.",

I do not think 3inches of oil is necessary I chose to do a half inch and they cooked perfectly. I'm definitely a savory girl so I recommend 1-2 tsp of salt.",

It was bland, however I prefer bland, and just the right amount of sweet for me(1 T brown sugar to the recipe). I could see how the addition of cayenne or other spice could add to it, and do nicely, but like another reviewer, have no idea if corn fritters are SUPPOSED to be bland. But it had a very nice corn flavor. I also fried in just a 1/4 inch depth mix of crisco/bacon grease rather than a whole bottle of cooking oil. Cook just like pancakes",

I added a pinch of cayenne about a teaspoon of garlic powder some season salt and a bit of onion powder to the flour/powder mix. Did fry in a pan with olive oil (about a quarter inch) When I dropped cold mixture I flattened a bit to make a patty. These were really good! The batter makes a crispy almost tempura type crunch around the sweet corn mix. I had mine with just salt and husband tried with Mae Ploy and sriracha but said they were good with just salt and pepper. What a great way to use up fresh corn off the cob. Thank you:) Next time I will try frying with coconut oil...just to see.",

I scooped out some of the batter into my hands and shaped them into patties. It made 7 patties at about a 4inch diameter. I pulled out the oven rack and one by one I used a metal spatula to place the fritters into the oil. I did 10 minutes on one side or until brown flipped them and did about 10 minutes on the other side or until brown. Great recipe just a different cooking method.",
