If you cook it and try to fry it straight away it clumps and does not fry well. Also use some Chinese five spices for a more authentic taste with frozen green peas. Add a bit of cilantro to the chopped scallions to finish it off. I make this regularly and my family say it is better than the take away. The soy sauce makes it NON GF so use the GF friendly type. I prefer the regular soy but cannot eat it and the GF type works ok.",

Used duck only (no pork on hand) brown rice instead of white and added sliced snow peas and napa cabbage. So good soy is just right for my taste but husband wanted more. Will definitely make again might add more vegetables for color and visual texture. Makes me want to rotisserie a duck more often just to have leftovers! Thanks for a great taste.",
