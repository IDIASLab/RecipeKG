The only thing I changed is that I used breasts and thighs as I enjoy dark meat too; and I can't imagine yellow curry chicken without potatoes so I added a few diced potatoes with the sherry and bouillon. My husband and I were skeptical if the potatoes would cook enough but they turned out just the right tenderness! Also I made sure I bought the \"hot\" curry powder at the store as I've cooked with other curry powder which turned out way too bland. It was just the right spiciness served over rice for our taste. My husband brought the leftovers to work for lunch a few times and his co-workers even commented that they had to go to a Thai restaurant that night because the smell made them crave curry! Thanks for the recipe!",

I added another tablespoon of curry powder and it still didn't seem enough. I also added 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper which did liven things up a bit but there seemed to be just too much too thick liquid to seem right. Sorry because it did look simple enough. Here are a few suggestions. Lightly sautee the onions and garlic in the oil. Add the curry powder and ginger and toast until it is fragrant then add the chicken to be coated with the spice mixture and sautee that a little. Bee certain to lightly coat the chicken with cornstarch or you'll have a lumpy mess on your hands! Then add the beef bouillon which you have dissolved in 1 cup or more of hot water (important!) and sherry to deglaze the pan. Then proceed with the peanut butter and water adding coconut milk toward the end.",
