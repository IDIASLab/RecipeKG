I use Turkey Ham because the pork ham leaves the dish a little greasy for me and the turkey ham seems to become a little more fall-apart tender to me. I put the garlic cloves in whole. They become sweet and tender without over-powering the dish. I always serve with a pat of butter. Sorry that I forgot that. I've begun adding caraway seeds from time to time which is a yummy addition and will top with some sour cream next time that I do. Great idea! Thanks! I like my cabbage super soft but for the people who find the flavor too strong or the person who found the cabbage flavor \"off \" adding it at the end is a great idea! I also love the polish kielbasa idea. We'll have to try it. I'll bet it adds another wonderful layer of flavor! The beauty of these Old-World dishes is that you get to alter them in very small ways to make them your own. We even substitute parsnips turnips and/or cauliflower for the potatoes sometimes and its super yummy! I hope that cleared some things up for you all and I hope it's continued to be enjoyed!",
