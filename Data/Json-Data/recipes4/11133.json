I followed the rest of the recipe and when I got to the rice it seemed like a little so I used a cup (which seemed to make the perfect amount for me and my family). When I first served it we all looked at it like \"ew....\" I was not excited about the prospect of tasting it however after we all tasted it we realized that it was actually pretty good!! So for me I think using 1/4 cup of oil (possibly even less) and 2 cups of rice is what will work for me. I think we will make this recipe again... I did have to modify it though I think it's way too oily as is (them greeks and their olive oil!!) Worth trying out!!!:) Oh and we got a laugh when my hubby (who hates tomatoes) said \"I think it needs more tomatoes\" heh!",

For those who are using it as a side dish, by all means cut back on the amount of oil to suit your tastes. ",

It was AWFUL--bland too watery (even after cooking with the lid off for about 30 minutes) too oily. Thanks to some creativity by my boyfriend it was salvageable and not too embarassing but it took a LOT of tweaking. Here's our recommendations/rescue methods: 1) cut the oil WAY down 2) we ended up adding another 1/3 cup of rice because it was too liquid 3) we then added another tablespoon of tomato paste and a can of diced tomatoes (we were running out of time!) 4) While cooking the orignal version and being able to see it was going to be quite bland I had already added fresh oregano and winter savory. In the rush-to-finish we added about a tablespoon of dried oregano a teaspoon of thyme and lots and lots of salt and pepper 5) Even after all that we still had to dip it into the serving bowl with a slotted spoon and when we got to the party there was a layer of oil resting atop the mush. But the guests loved it.",
