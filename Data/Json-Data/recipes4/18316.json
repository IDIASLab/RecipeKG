Then we add the onions and garlic to the sausage, then we add 4 cups chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon cubes, along with the potatoes and kale, and also add a parmesan rind (MAKES IT!).  Then we do the heavy cream at the end.  Great base recipe, but a couple of minor changes make all the difference!",
