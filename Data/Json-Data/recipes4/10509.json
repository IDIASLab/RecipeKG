When it was finished it was only half way up the side of the pan and figured that my first assumption was right and that this was another loaf for relegated as fit only for making breadcrumbs. But when I had sliced the loaf to make crumbs the texture was similar to other store bought 100% rye bread and it surprisingly turned out to a very tasty loaf particularly toasted. I will make it again as that my wife prefers to eat gluten free and this loaf is tasty and economical.",
