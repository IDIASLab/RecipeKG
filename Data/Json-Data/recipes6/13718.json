The recipe says to cook and allow to THICKEN, but I felt it was too thick before I even began to cook it. I desired my pumpkin butter to end up about the consistency of apple butter, which is why I added the extra liquid. Just adjust your consistency according to your liking and it will turn out perfectly. I had it on buttered toast and it was divine and perfect for Fall. I have canned it (6 full pint jars with a double recipe) and will be decorating the jars with fabric, labels, and raffia tomorrow for gifts.",

I used canned organic pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice and *no* added sugar except for a drizzle  (about 1tablespoon) of real maple syrup and a few shakes of stevia powder (a natural safe sweetner); it came out sweet enough...I can't imagine adding the 1.5 cups of sugar the recipe calls for, totally un-needed. I did use about 1 cup of apple juice rather than the 3/4 C recommended as I like it a bit less thick. Put it in my crockpot and then canned after hot water bath.  Would totally recommend to anyone, completely yummy and super easy to make.  \r\n\r\nWe love it on toast and on whole wheat buttermilk pancakes instead of maple syrup for a nice change and less sugar.",

I used 1 cup of light brown sugar instead, I like it better and it suited my taste.  \r\nIf you take the innards of the pumpkin and puree it in a blender, the recipe is great the way it is since the pumpkin balances out the ginger.  For my next batch; however, I boiled the pumpkin meat and then pureed it, thus taking some of the taste away, and with this I found that the amount of ginger was too much.  The taste was a little over powering.  To resolve this, I just halved the ginger, but then again I spice to taste so there is a little more of the other spices in there too.  All in all, I am very pleased with this recipe and intend on using it again.",
