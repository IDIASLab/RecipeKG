They are not overly sweet. The texture is puffy but firm. I tried this recipe with no changes but found the dough a little sticky to roll and added bout 1 cup more flour. They were great. Next batch I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and chilled dough before rolling. Wow! Just like grandma's. Yields approximately 3 dozen cookies with an average 3\" cookie cutter. Of course this will vary depending on cutter size. I've tried these with and without sprinkling sugar on top before baking and enjoy them both. For a sweeter holiday d\u00e9cor try cookie icing on the tops after cooling. This one is a pleaser of children and adults and you will find the cookie jar empty in no time at all.",

I love the dough and how easy it is to work with but I gave it 3 stars based on the taste and not as soft as I like my cut out cookies. I like a soft cookie and this is somewhat soft. The sides of the cookie were on the hard side while the middle was softer. I even baked them less time than I normally bake these as there really wasn't a time on it. I really wished I could of given this 5 stars but not going to happen on this recipe. If your thinking it's my oven I don't have this with any other cookies. And I bake a lot. Just couldn't find my usual cut out recipe. I will find it now.",
