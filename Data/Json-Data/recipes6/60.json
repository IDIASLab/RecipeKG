                "reviewBody": "It's unfortunate to have to rate this pretty darned good meatloaf so poorly, but the fact that the cooking time is SO way off can neither be excused nor ignored. While he does mention that the meatloaf should reach a temperature of 160 degrees, a professional chef certainly ought to know that a 2-1/2 pound meatloaf would never cook through in 45 minutes, and this error could result in a very disappointing outcome for the inexperienced cook who trusts the recipe. The error should be corrected, as the recipe itself deserves a better rating - and the cooks who try this should be able to rely on the directions.  As for the meatloaf itself, the \"almost puree\" of vegetables was novel for me, and I liked it. Not only are you getting some extra nutrients, but all these vegetables also contribute moisture and great flavor to the meatloaf.  I'm not a fan of \"Italian seasoning,\" so I just threw in a handful of fresh herbs - parsley, sage, thyme and oregano. I omitted the cayenne.  I also skipped the glaze, which neither of us cares for.  Cooking time will vary given the size and shape of your meatloaf, but my 2 pound loaf was cooked just right at 350 degrees for an hour and a half.  (AR, if you correct the time and temp on this recipe, please raise my rating to four stars)",

Those were the only changes I made. Ginormous meat loaf. It fit in my Perfect Meat Loaf pan, but just barely, with a quarter inch at the top. Mine did take almost two hours to bake, taken out the last half hour to pour over the glaze. This was one of the better meat loaves I've ever made. Very flavorful, quite filling. I served homemade biscuits and Cheesy Vegetable Medley with this. Out of that big meatloaf, just under half remains--my oldest boy ate two pieces and my husband ate three! We all really liked it. The rest will be used for sandwiches in lunches tomorrow. I'll make this meat loaf again.",

I watched the video & noted forming the loaf in a dish rather than I had been accustomed to using a bread loaf pan. I doubt I'll ever use a loaf pan again for meatloaf. I liked how this cooked in a larger casserole dish. I gave this 4 stars only because the sauce was too \"mustardy\" taste. We like a sweeter sauce so I just added more ketchup & brown sugar.",

I didn't have celery, so used green pepper and omitted the mushrooms because of lack thereof, but would definitely add them next time. the main difference was I put them in muffin tins (the big ones, not the little cupcake ones) and they were wonderful. Cooked it at 350 for 30-35min TOTAL. Very flavorful and moist.",
