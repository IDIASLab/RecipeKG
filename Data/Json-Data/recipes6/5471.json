But, if you use BROWN rice, try soaking the rice in water for about 20 minutes before cooking  (be sure to drain it), then cook the rice in plain water with just a little oil or butter and NO salt (or chicken broth with NO SALT CONTENT).  The rice will cook faster and turn out MUCH softer and plumper with presoaking and without the salt.  To get that chicken broth flavor, you can add chicken bouillon after the rice is cooked.  Brown rice cooked in a salty liquid just doesn't ever get really done.",

I started off by using about 2 tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of oil and I sauteed about 20 small button mushrooms maybe more thinly sliced, 5 cloves of garlic thinly sliced, 2 spring onion and 1 medium onion cut in half and thinly sliced, few sprigs of thyme because I love it, a teaspoon or so of dried oregano a teaspoon or more of salt and a few dash of worchestishire sauce for about 15 min until the mushrooms were really soft and dark brown. I then added the rice and cooked the rice in the mushrooms for about 10 min max stiring a lot to avoid it sticking over medium heat. Then I added beef stock to get the added brown colour and taste. YUMMY! I let the liquid come to a boil then i put on the lid and put the heat on low and then once the rice was still firm but all the water was absorbed i took the lid off and took the pot off the heat so that the rice wouldnt over cook while it cooled down a bit. So excited for left overs tomorrow, i wanted to lick the pot when it was done it was good.",
