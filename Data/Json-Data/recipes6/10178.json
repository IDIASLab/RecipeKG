It is made with all whole grains and has no refined sugar. Although, I had to use an emulsion blender to get the banana fully blended. However, taste, its not bad but would be better with strawberry or other fruit topping or whipped cream. It just needs something. Also, wasn't too sure how I felt about the almond flour. The submitter referred to it as a crispiness, I thought it was more of an after texture with the almond bits. I would opt to not add that on a similar recipe, even though it is healthy protein. Only change I made was using white whole wheat flour. I got 7 pancakes.",
