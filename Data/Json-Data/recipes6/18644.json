First, I added an egg and substituted the water for buttermilk.  Some previous users commented that the muffins appeared grayish-- the milk should solve this problem.  I also added some cinnamon and vanilla extract to help the flavor-- not too much, you don't want to overpower the almond!  I used about 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Hope that helps everyone, they turned out great for me!!\n",

I used 1 cup of sugar and sprinkled sugar on top too. Kids loved them. But I love the combination of almond extract and raspberries.
