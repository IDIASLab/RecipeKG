I didn't care for the raspberries (which I'd actually thought would be my favorite part!) but still enjoyed the pie. Pies are hard for me to rate because I prefer cake but since everyone else seemed to enjoy this a 5 it is (I personally would have rated it a \"4\"). I followed the recipe as is though I did have to use frozen (thawed) peaches due to seasonality. I wasn't sure what variety of apples to use so I used a mac a granny smith and a gala. I also added a handful of oats to the topping and subbed almond for pecans per personal preference. TY for a nice pie twist!",

I took advice from some other reviewers and prebaked the crust cut down on the white sugar and substituted whole oats for the nuts in the crumb topping. With prebaked crust (10min @400F) the cook time could shorten to 30min. With leftover fruit I mixed in leftover crumb topping and baked in corning dish 20min - bet it'll be great with ice cream tomorrow!",
