The only thing I do differently is to use 2 pints of heavy whipping cream and 2 cups of whole milk. I find when you use both it defiantly tastes more like the ice cream you buy in stores and you don't end up w/ those ice crystals in it. So far I've made this plain for hot fudge sundays, I've made cookie dough... before freezing I just add chunks of cookie dough (also eggless that I got on this site... just follow suggestions in the reviews), I've made strawberry w/ crushed up fortune cookies in it (don't ask.. LOL), I've made choc chip using mini M&M's, I've made oreo.. I used a blender for half the package so I would have little specks of choc throughout the entire icecream and I crush up the rest of the package by hand so I've got some bigger chunks. Again, I add right before freezing and now my new favorite is mint choc chip. I just add 1 tbs of peppermint extract and before I freeze the icecream I added one Gharidelli (sp?) bittersweet chocolate bar that I chopped up into small pieces. It's even better than Bryers! Thanks for this recipe, I won't even try another one! ",

I cut the recipe in half and it was still too much for our maker. I made the mix in a pitcher and just poured the appropriate amount in the mixer leaving the rest in the pitcher to make another small batch later. Second I used 2/3 heavy cream and 1/3 2% milk. Other reviewers mentioned they had ice crystals but I did not have that problem. Right out of the ice cream maker it was a bit like soft serve so I put the canister in the freezer for a few hours and wound up with some amazingly creamy and delicious ice cream! I also threw a small handful of chocolate chips in during the last 5 minutes of mixing but I think miniature chips would be better. This is now my go-to vanilla ice cream recipe! YUMMY!!!",
