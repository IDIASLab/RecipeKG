I used 3/4 c margaine instead of shortening quick-cooking oatmeal instead of rolled oats nestle hot cocoa mix w/ marshmallows instead of unsweetened cocoa and then subseqeuently reduced sugar (which was just ultra fine not white) to 1 1/4 c. Turned out great! Oh I also ran out of oatmeal so I threw in Cheerios so it wouldn't be so runny and didn't have any coconut so I didn't use any.:o) Moral: The basic recipe is very good and can be innovated to fit your needs/wants.",
