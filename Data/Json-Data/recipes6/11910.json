I ended up baking them around 7 minutes at 350. I recommend doing a test cookie or two to get your time and temperature down before you destroy an entire pan like me. I didn't have any problem rolling them out and I liked the light texture but I agree that they could use a bit more flavor. I may do another batch tomorrow with a 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of coconut flavor. One more nitpick on the recipe: let them cool completely before attempting the powdered sugar finish.",
