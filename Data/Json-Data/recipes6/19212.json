With the familiar ingredients easy technique and my own experience I thought I couldn't go wrong despite the not-so-hot reviews. One reviewer questioned the addition of corn starch so early in the cooking: good question. That seems to be what went wrong. The flavor wasn't TOO bad but all in all this was a failure. I have used all of these ingredients in the past mostly together or in similar dishes but in this dish it all went terribly wrong. Thank goodness for rice and a salad on the side.",
