In addition to tasting great, it's also moist and tender. I didn't bother with the topping- I saw no need for it, and my husband hates frosting.  Instead of the pineapple juice in the cake I pureed part of the can of pineapple chunks with some of the juice and added that to the cake. I also used 4 eggs instead of 5, and substituted soy milk for the milk.  Yum Yum is right!",
