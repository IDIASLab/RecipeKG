I then grilled the breasts on my George Foreman grill to get a nice sear on the outside to lock in all the natural juices in the meat. Then I put them in a covered casserole in the oven for 45 min instead of an hour. The grilling gave a rich brown caramelizing effect to the sauce as well. Very tasty. I added my picture to the recipe. I hope you enjoy my changes:o)",
