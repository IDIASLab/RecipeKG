You can put this in a traditional crust or Pecan Nut Crust from this site. Boiling the rum before adding to the recipe will remove almost all the alcohol. This really is an easy pie to make, and once you get the hang of it you can just about make it with your eyes closed! I guarantee rave reviews at Thanksgiving or Christmas!",
