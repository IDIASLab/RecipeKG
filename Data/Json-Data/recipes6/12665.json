TH's recipe calls for the very same proportions of sugar egg and fat as this recipe PLUS an additional 1/4 cup flour which would be helpful to those ending up with super-flat cookies. I think I may have stuck closer to TH's recipe anyway - used butter instead of shortening and equal amounts brown and white sugar. It needs at least 1/2 tsp. salt. I also chilled the dough for several hours before rolling into balls and baking. They turned out fine. Not mind-blowing; just \"eh.\"",
