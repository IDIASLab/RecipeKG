I cut a piece of parchment paper to fit my pan then sprayed the edges of the pan with cooking spray.  I allowed the cake to cool about 20 minutes then I lifted it out of the pan with parchment paper stuck to the bottom of it and flipped it (carefully) on to another piece of parchment paper with a generous amount of powdered sugar sprinkled on it.  Then I just peeled the parchment off the bottom of the roll, spread on icing, sprinkled some finely chopped walnuts on top of icing and re-rolled the cake.  Wrapped it up on a piece of heavy duty foil and put it freezer for about 45 minutes to set up.  Then moved to fridge.  Just fantastic.  It's a beautiful presentation and the taste is incredible.  If you are hesitating to try because it looks difficult you should definitely try it!",

Using less icing may help, and if I ever try this again, I will chill the icing until it is fairly firm and allow the cake to cool longer. Four stars for taste, negative one star for being a pain....**Update- 2nd attempt: I used wax paper on the pan, then another sheet on the inside when I rolled it. This prevented it from sticking to the towel. Greasing it would be good too. I didn't soften the c. cheese as much and chilled it while the cake cooled. This made it much easier to spread w/out gushing out. Came out almost as good looking as the pics-- I'll keep trying! Tastes awesome. ",

I baked my cake in an 11X15 for the 15 minutes and it came out perfect.  I had no trouble rolling it up like described in the directions.  I had a lot extra filling (about \u00bd worth).  I made two of these and found that making the filling while the cake is cooking and then putting the filling in the fridge until it is needed.  I found with my first one, I let my filling sit out and then when I spread it on the still warm cake that it made the filling more runner which is why I am suspecting the other review had the problem of it spilling out all over the place.  I would also suggest not putting the whole filling on unless you need it, this will help prevent the filling from spilling out everywhere.",

I also used wax paper on the bottom of my pan. On my first try I learned that the cake sticks to the wax paper after you remove it from the oven. So I sprayed the wax paper with cooking spray and it works great. I can carefully take the wax paper out of the pan and flip it over onto the damp towel. Also, to dampen the linen towel I over-wet a wash cloth and layed it on top of the towel in several places. It created a more even wetness on the towel. My family has gone crazy over this recipe.

The method was a smidge difficult at first but I'm pretty sure that's because I used a pan that was too small. I have been using a half sheet pan recently and it works PERFECTLY. With that size the cake is so thin that it's nearly impossible for it to break when you're rolling. My husband who has something to say about EVERYTHING said \"Well I just can't fine one thing that I'd improve about this.\" Only his mom and I know what a major deal that is but you need to take my word for it!!! The things I changed/altered: -- I used Egg Beaters because I just never have eggs. -- I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it worked beautifully. -- I added extra nutmeg and cinnamon. Totally personal preference but the fall spicy flavor really pops when you do that.",

I did make it in a larger pan (11x15) because I didn't have a 9x13 jelly roll pan but that shouldn't have affected the texture in that way! It just didn't seem to rise it wasn't fluffy at all and it was so rubbery! I'm not sure if that was the way this recipe is supposed to be but all other pumpkin cake roll recipes I've seen have a more fluffy cake. Thanks for sharing it tastes fantastic but the texture is just not for me. I will be looking for a different recipe.",
