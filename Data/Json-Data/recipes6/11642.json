These had an odd texture to them that I have never had when baking bread--they weren't chewy exactly but kind of mealy more like a biscuit (although these definitely tasted more like rolls than bixcuits). I might try making these again but I would add more salt to give them a little more flavor. Also like another reviewer noted I think these would turn out better if after the dough has risen the first time they were formed into balls and allowed to rise again before baking.",
