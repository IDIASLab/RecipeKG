He was pleasantly surprised to make an exception with this cake.  He thought it was the best banana cake he ever tasted.  I made this cake several times and tinkered with it a bit.  I found that the baking soda left a slight aftertaste, so I reduced the baking soda to 1 1/2 tsp., added 1/2 tsp. baking POWDER, added 1/2-3/4 tsp. cinnamon, added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, and 1/2 - 1 cup chopped walnuts to the batter.  It came out perfect!  You can also bake this in a 13 x 9 inch pan for 35-40 minutes, as cupcakes for 20-23 minutes, or as mini loaves for 30-40 minutes.",
