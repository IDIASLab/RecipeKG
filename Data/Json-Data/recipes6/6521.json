But that is a non issue as it likely tastes the same as Campbells, who obviously does not have the resources to accommodate those among us who have celiac disease.  But I digress.  I take umbrage with the onions cut into 1\" squares.  Why?  It went against everything I know from my many years of cooking.  But I did it anyway.  If you are going to use this recipe, and I suggest you do for a great quick meal, DICE the onions and either saut\u00e9 or cook with the hamburger.  Only complaint.  Other wise good, quick recipe.  And maybe add some cooked mixed veggies.  Sorry for the 3 star but the whole onion thing is dumb.",
