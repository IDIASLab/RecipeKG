I thought the butter flavor might compete with the cherry flavor so I used 1/2 cup Crisco instead of 1/2 cup of the butter. I also added about 1/8 cup extra cherry juice because the batter's cherry flavor wasn't strong enough for me. The cake turned out nice and moist. In a bundt pan it took about 50 minutes to bake. It still barely had enough cherry flavor for me but everyone who tried it liked it. The texture was great. In the future I would use almond flavor instead of vanilla (but maybe only 2 tsp so it's not overpowering). Also I would at least double the amount of cherry pieces--the pieces were few and far between. Overall a great cake that's easy to make!",
