After reading the reviews, I made a couple of changes...I chopped up my two cups of sliced strawberries to make them finer, as one reviewer said that the sliced strawberries got very hard when frozen and made the dessert hard to cut. This was a great idea...the strawberry juices got into the fluffy mixture, turning it a pretty pale pink color. And I had no problems cutting the frozen dessert. Also, I cut the lemon juice to about 1 tsp.; I may add more next time, as the dessert was pretty sweet. I had a bit of a problem with the meringue portion, as my sugar didn't dissolve, no matter how much I whipped it. When I added the strawberries, though, the sugar dissolved just fine and the dessert came out fabulously well. My family absolutely loved it..the only complaint they had was that there should have been more crust. So next time I may make 1 1/2 times the crust portion, to make a thicker crust. Thanks for sharing this recipe...it's a keeper!",

I finely chopped up 2 c. of fresh strawberries and sprinkled 1T of white sugar over the strawberries  to help make it more sweeter and release its' red juices. When I folded the strawberry mixture into the whipped cream, its' juices made a pretty pink color. And when I poured the filling over the crust it made nice pink and white swirls throughout the filling. I froze this dessert for at least 8 hours before cutting into it.  Once frozen solid I had no problem cutting into the squares. I placed a dollop of homemade whipped cream from this site,\"Sweetened Whipped Cream\". This dessert makes a pretty presentation with flecked strawberry bits in the pinkish hue filling. The strawberries are definitely sweet and juicy. The filling itself is light, fluffy and creamy. I like the crunchy toasted walnuts in the crust as well as the topping. It adds a nice texture to the dessert. It is not too sweet -just right. The crust ended up being the right amount for this size dessert and I am glad I increased the amount. We all enjoyed this cool and creamy dessert. Frozen whipped cream blended with chopped strawberries and topped with a crunchy walnut topping, is a refreshing and perfect way to end a hot, humid day here in Hawaii!",

I also add more strawberries and I beat the strawberries with the eggs and sugar. However I save some bigger chunks to fold in with the whipping cream.",
