I typically follow the recipe the first time I make something so I have a handle on what it is supposed to taste like but I did have to make a few changes based on what I had on hand. I only had one can of enchilada sauce (10 oz) so I used some salsa verde that I had to make up the difference. I also used canned corn (drained) since I didn't have frozen. Next time I make this (and I WILL be!) I think I'll add some black beans in and then toss some green onions on top. Easy and tasty! Thank you Carrie Ann!",

I used fat free sour cream and had 4 blend mexican cheese so used that and had canned corn so used that rather than frozen. Instead of layering the different items I mixed everything together including 2/3 of the cheese then put it all into the baking dish and sprinked the rest of the cheese on top along with some sliced up black olives. Thank you for a very good quick and easy recipe that we will be fixing often. This would be a good dish to fix up ahead of time for a pot luck!",
