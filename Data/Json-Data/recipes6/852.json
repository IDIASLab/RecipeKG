I was hoping they would come out with the texture of brownies/blondies but I still think it was dry for a fruit and nut bar which is essentially what this was (I didn't add the raisins but I didn't miss them). Maybe next time I will add another egg or egg yolk. I tripled the amount of cinnamon and it has an absolutely delightful cinnamon taste. However I should have increased the amount of coffee I put in as well because the bitterness was non-existent (and I used French Roast coffee). Good start though!",
