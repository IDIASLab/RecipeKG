I love marshmallow flavor so that is why I liked it so much. I probably would not add vanilla next time as it turned the color to a beige. It is a little stringy when cold but I found if I heated it in the microwave for a few seconds it was easier to put over the ice cream. Thanks",

Also agree that marshmallows don't need to be chopped or pre melted; however, with that being said, this is not a good marshmallow topping for ice cream. It would be great for cakes, sweet potatoes, or other desserts, but not for ice cream. It gets stringy and chewy when it hits the cold ice cream... not what a good topping should do. So for that reason, because its listed as an ice cream topping recipe, I have to give it only two stars.",
