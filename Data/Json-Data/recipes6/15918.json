So I used fresh blueberries in place of the preserves and opted not to top it off with anything more than a dusting of powdered sugar and a little dollop of fresh whipped cream. The fresh fruit toned down the sweetness and was a really nice contrast to the cheese filling. This was a fun dish to make and I think the possibilities are endless as far as the fillings and toppings go! Thanks!",
