(I used roti bread instead of pita for the crust which probably tasted even better, IMO.  Can't wait to make this recipe again.  Thanks, CaptainCook!",

Since I didn't have any lemons, I substituted the juice of 2 limes and added 1/4 c. seasoned rice wine vinegar to make up the rest. I marinaded the chicken breasts for only 1 hour and it still came out very flavorful. My husband prefers to have his chicken well-done, so he grilled for 6 min. per side, which made the chicken a bit dry....I'd stick with the 5 min. per side. Quick, easy and super flavorful recipe!",

After we remove the chicken, we bring the marinade to a rolling boil for several minutes to kill any bacteria and reduce it, then use it for a dipping sauce.  Or, if reusing marinade grosses you out, simply double it, and set half aside for the dipping sauce and the other half for marinade.  I serve it with coconut rice (which also goes well with the sauce).  Delicious!",
