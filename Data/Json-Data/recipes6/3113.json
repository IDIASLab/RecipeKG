I followed the directions up to the point that it was supposed to go into a slow cooker for an hour (another dirty pot) which simply didn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense to me.  I ended up cooking this stove top for about 20 minutes, and it turned out well.  For us, it was a bit sweet (personal taste preference) but still tasted very good.  Thanks for sharing your dear friend\u2019s recipe.",
