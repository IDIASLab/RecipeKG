My first bite, I actually coughed as I swallowed the sour sauce, and my husband and 4 kids looked up at me expectantly....not wanting to taint their view, I said, \"it's a bit hot (temperature-wise.)\"  My 2-year-old said, \"sour\" about 20 times while she was eating it.  If I make this again, I'll do half chicken broth and half vinegar, just to cut down on the sour taste.  My friend who lived in the Philippines for 2 years liked it and said that's the way chicken adobo is.  I didn't serve it with rice (but with bread) so that probably made it seem more sour.  Safeway was out of bok choy, so I used kale and red cabbage, which turned out well (probably healthier than bok choy, too.)",

Ate leftovers over rice and added dollop of sour cream and hot sauce 2 days running. Will make again - husband wants to try it with regular cabbage rather than bok choy but he's a cabbage nut!
