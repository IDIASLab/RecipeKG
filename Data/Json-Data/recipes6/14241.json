I substituted 1/2 c. heavy cream and 1/4 c. of coffee mate vanilla caramel for some of the milk.  I also added a fourth egg.  It cooked up beautifully - nice and fluffy - and was eaten by all my dinner guests.  The leftovers also taste great - even cold.  I will use this recipe again for sure.",

I used Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Raisin Bread, so I didn'g add raisins. I only used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, as 2 cups of sugar sounded way too sweet. I beat together the milk (not hot), eggs, sugars, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg, and then poured that over the torn bread. I let that stand for 15 minutes or so and then poured it into the pan with melted butter and baked it. I just seemed easier that way. This is the best bread pudding I've ever made!
