Next time I will only use half the suggesteed amount.  It is an expensive spice, but try looking in the \"International\" aisle of your grocery store.  I have found that the hispanic section has a nice selection of spices at half the cost.  I would also advise using a coffee grinder.  You can only grind a half cup at a time, but it's faster than the food processor.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, it's a keeper!",

I used all the spices in the recipe plus the recommended additional spices in the header.  The only change I made to recipe was to use decaf instant tea and 1 1/2 cups splenda in lieu of 2 1/2 cups of sugar.  Thank you to the person who said the blender was messy and to the person who suggested the coffee grinder.  This worked perfectly. For those of you making gifts, this recipe makes 4 half pint jars.  I am going to suggest on my gift tags that the recipient use 2-3 t. per cup.  Next time I am in the grocery store I will be replinishing the ingredients I used up so I can make another batch for me!!!!!",

This recipe matches the taste perfectly (except I cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups). Don't be put off by the expense of the cardamom -- it's worth it. If using a blender mix ingredients with a fork first then blend only about a cup and a half at a time. Also be sure to blend it really well (because the spices can get kind of chunky in your drink).",
