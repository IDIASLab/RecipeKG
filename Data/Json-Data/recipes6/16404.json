Personally I use canned whole tomatoes (the closest thing you can get to fresh tom's imo) that I split with my fingers remove the seeds (which only make the sauce bitter) then roughly chop. Depending on what I'm using it for I use a hand blender to puree the sauce until it is as smooth/chunky as required (smooth for marinara dipping sauce chunky for pizza sauce chunkier for pasta sauce etc). Something else I do (I saw this on tv) is to save the dry rinds from Parmesan and add those to the sauce. Remove them when you're done and you've got a lovely subtle flavor. Anyway I'm looking forward to having this later for dinner with 'Sicilian Meat Roll.' Thanks Betsy!",
