I used the suggestions of some other reviewers and used brewed coffee instead of water over the cake mix; I also mixed some vanilla and almond extracts into the coffee. It seems like you could tweak the recipe any way you want in order to get the flavor you want - I'm thinking next time of adding some spices like chipotle powder and cinnammon to make it into a sort of mexican hot fudge cake. A very good choice for something easy to make and with lots of chocolate flavor. oh and another time I made it I used a ruby port wine that I had sitting around - it made it fruity and richer and also left it with a hint of an alcohol taste. would be good for a christmas dessert.",

I followed the advice of many reviews and added an extra tablespoon of cocoa and a teaspoon of vanilla to the cake mix reduced the amount of liquid to 1 1/3 cups and used coffee for part of the liquid. The sauce was exactly the right consistency but I used a cup of coffee and 1/3 cup of water and next time I'd probably just use half and half. The coffee adds excellent flavor but too much will give it a bitter tinge. It's hard to get that chocolatey-brownie taste with only cocoa so sometime I might try adding melted chocolate or chocolate chunks to the batter. Delicious served warm this is a great comfort food for a chocaholic. Thanks!",
