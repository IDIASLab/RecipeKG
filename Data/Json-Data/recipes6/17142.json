This recipe was obtained from a local nursing home and is so easy my 9 year old makes them and the flavor is changeable to your taste. I generally make 2 batches so that we don't have to store half a can of evaporated milk. Our favorite flavors are made with chocolate fudge or butterscotch pudding.",

I used Devils Food Pudding Mix (Highly Recommended) and cut the sugar to 1-1/2 cups. I used the stove top and let the mixture boil for 2 min. then added the pudding and oats. PERFECT!

I read it wrong the first time too and almost dumped in the whole can. I used 6 oz and they were not too moist at all actually almost too dry. They didn't set on their own so I popped them in the oven at 400 for 7 min. I had no parchment paper so I just sprayed the cookie sheet with PAM and it worked fine. Any longer than 7 min though and they burned (oops). I also used splenda fat-free/sugar-free pudding and fat-free evap. milk. Will try to experiment with butter substitute next time.",

My cookies seemed to set just fine but I used as much oatmeal as seemed necessary in order to make the cookies form more solidly. Towards the end I rolled up sunflower seeds in the cookies and my roommate like the seeded ones even better. edit: i decided i wanted the cookies to be less sticky so I smushed the cookies into a cookie-like shape (flatter) and baked the no-bake cookies for about 15 min. at 400 deg. Crunchy outside - chewy inside. Even better! Perhaps defeating the purpose but tasty nonetheless.",
