You will appreciate this if you have no dishwasher:) Caramelize the onion with a little butter and brown sugar in a large soup pot. Add in crushed garlic when the onion is almost fully cooked. Remove cooked onions from pot and set aside to cool in a soup bowl. Boil the chicken stock in the same large pot reduce heat and cook the squash until it is tender. Remove from heat. Use a masher to mash squash while it is still in the pot. Add orange juice curry and any other seasoning. Let all the ingredients cool off a bit. Combine the caramelized onion with the squash broth in blender and blend. Return to the large pot. Heat to a boil add rice reduce heat and adjust seasoning. Once the rice is cooked the soup is complete. Tip: the more pale the squash is at the grocery store the less ripe it is so choose one with more color.",

Orange juice just didn't even sound good so I left it out entirely. But the recipe still needs some acid so I pureed 3 or 4 yellow tomatoes and a green apple in my blender and added that at the beginning. I also carmelized 2 red onions in butter and brown sugar and added those. The box of wild rice I just threw in no need to cook it separately. I used six cups of chicken broth an entire large squash which I steamed first and then pureed before adding to the soup and a whole tablespoon of curry powder. It was just amazing--the flavor had so much depth and oddly you couldn't taste curry--it just sort of blended in as if it belonged there. IMO you can't go wrong with curry butternut and wild rice!Thanks for this recipe!!",

                "reviewBody": "Since I am making this soup in October here in Michigan I substituted apple cider from the cider mill for the orange juice. I added a peeled apple to the onion and garlic (OK I used two cloves of garlic). Rather than boiling the squash I chose to cook it covered on low heat w/ the onion/garlic/apple until it was soft (about 45 minutes). I like soup w/ texture so I reserved a portion of the veggies before pureeing the rest. I cooked the rice in the broth then added to the pot. The first time I made the soup I tried cooking the rice in w/ the puree and found that the rice remained too firm even after boiling for an hour so cooking it in the broth is the way to go. I made this soup for some vegetarian friends using a vegetable stock for the chicken and it was awesome. I really like this soup w/ cucumber slices - the cool crunch is a nice contrast. Thank you for this delicious recipe!",

It turned out really well- I just simmered everything together for about 45 minutes.",
