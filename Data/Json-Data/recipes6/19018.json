If you make it this way you will not be dissapointed. This is what I did: I mixed in the blender 1/4 c canola oil, 1 medium onion, 1 red bell pepper and 5 cloves of garlic to create a chunky paste. I then sauted it for 4 min, lowered the heat to simmer and added 2 tsp minced ginger, 2 tbsp curry powder, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 tsp sugar, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes and 2 tbsp flour, mixing energetically for 2 min. I then gradually added 2 c of light coconut milk all the while mixing energetically untill the sause thickened and became uniform. I simmered the sauce for 4 min, then increased the heat to medium-high again, added the shrimp, mixed well to coat and cooked for 4-5 min. Finally I added 1/2 c chopped fresh cilantro and 3/4c shredded coconut, mixed one last time and turned off the heat. THE RESULT WAS HARDLY ENOUGH FOR 2 CURRY LOVERS!!! YUM, YUM, YUM! THANK YOU DAKOTA and all the reviewers! I also plan on making this with chicken and I will try peanuts instead of shredded coconut next time.",

I didn't have coriander or cilantro and I love both... so I shouldn't have made it without them. Secondly I didn't see the need for the teaspoon of sugar but in hindsight I should have. On a good note I did what a prior review AGLIKA recommended and put the first few ingredients in a food processor before sauteeing. This thickened the sauce nicely and I didn't have to add the cornstarch/H20. I also up'd the red pepper flakes which gave it more heat. I cannot wait to make this recipe again THE RIGHT WAY. On a Side Note: I always loved curry-coconut shrimp in restaurant eventhough nutrition-wise it's right up there with alredo sauce. So I could never bring myself to make this at home considering how terribly fattening it is. However this recipe is LowFat LowCal and LowCarb... amazing!",

I stuck with the recipe substituting only light coconut milk for the regular variety (save a couple of calories) and omitted the red pepper because I didn't have it on hand. I added a little cornstarch at the end but I think I would leave this out next time - it was actually a little too thick. BONUS SIDE DISH: I made a middle eastern coconut rice on the side (cooked the rice in half light coconut milk and water) then after cooking added toasted coconut (toasted in a pan with a little olive oil) toasted almond and toasted raisins all mixed through the rice (do all the toasting separately). With the curry-coconut shrimp it was absolutely delicious!",

Quick and easy to prepare this recipe really delivers. I enjoyed it a lot! (Again Hubs not so much) I served this over jasmine rice with steamed baby bok choy and yellow patty pan squash.
