Instead, I dropped rounded spoonfuls on a baking sheet and baked at 375 for 20 minutes as instructed.  These scones couldn't have been any better from a New York City bakery!  I've made three batches of this recipe in one week and everyone who has tried one has raved (and everyone thinks they must be so hard to make!  I've got them fooled!)   I use the Crasins found next to raisins and leave out the sugar and orange.  For variation, I've substituted chocolate chips and walnuts.  DELICIOUS and PERFECT every time!!!",
