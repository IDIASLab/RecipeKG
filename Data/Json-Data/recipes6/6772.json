I have had a really soupy dough after waiting 18+ hours and this is what has helped for me:  use  a little more flour on your surface than Chef John did, also, use a bench scraper or spatula.  I learned this tip from watching another person make sticky bread.  Using a bench scraper allows you to manipulate the dough without even touching it.  You can lift up the dough with it and sprinkle some more flour underneath without making a horrible mess.  I've probably added up to another cup of flour doing this, but I'm not doing any kneading.  When I get to the point where I think I'm ready to transfer it on to the silicon, I put it in a 10 inch silicon cake pan.  This way it doesn't spread out so much.  You actually end up getting a highter loaf.  You are going to be able to see that it was done in a pan with sides, but it does brown nicely on the bottom and more importantly you get wonderful bread!",
