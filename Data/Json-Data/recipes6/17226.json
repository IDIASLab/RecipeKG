Well, here's what I did: I halved the recipe since I only needed a small batch. I did NOT cut the sugar. And HERE'S A TIP: Think about how you like your cornbread- not sweet, moderately sweet, or Southern sweet. I am from SC, and I like mine nice n sweet, so that's why I didn't cut the sugar. But if you don't like sweet cornbread, adjust the sugar accordingly. Also, I grated a whole onion (even though, when halved, the recipe calls for 1/2 onion). Grating allows you to get tiny pieces of onion AND the onion \"juice.\" With the onion juice, I didn't have to add any milk or buttermilk. I just mixed thoroughly. Also, since I DIDN'T HAVE ANY SELF-RISING FLOUR, I added 1/2t baking powder to the batter, and also 1t salt (remember, I halved the recipe). These didn't last long with my 1 and 3 year old. Okay, fine, I had more than my fair share, too! Awesome recipe! 5 stars any day!",

I also added a can of creamed corn and the batter was perfect, no milk needed.  Let the batter sit for 10 minutes before frying.  I can't wait to make these again.",
