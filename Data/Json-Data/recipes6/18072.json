Also, blanched almonds with the shredded coconuts helps with buildling the sauce. A tip on making Beef Rendang is to use a mortar and pestle to grind the spices, if you could find one. It takes longer to use mortar & pestle, but you can taste the difference when you use a food processor. Also, palm sugar is preferred to white sugar. Otherwise, the recipe is quite authentic. :)",

My partner is Malaysian and food critical. Attempting Rendang was a risky being universally known as difficult to achieve authentic results. I used real cocoanuts smashing them and then grating the white flesh remembering once being told that the secret of Rendang lies in the cocoanut. There is definitely a balance to be reached on cooking times. I had all the right weights and timings. Things seemed fine 15 minutes into the simmer then 15 minutes later the liquid had dramatically vanished even just starting to stick and burn. Yes it was a low heat. Further the meat didn t seem that tender. Panic I decided to put scrape the whole thing into a pan with a closed lid and added more water and give it another 20 minutes. The final result very good everyone liked it. The taste was really close to the real thing but I was advised that the meat should actually be quite hard and have the coconut sticking to it. That s the art and challenge I believe. Once that I am sure this recipe is capable of delivering with practice and care on liquids Vs Cooking times. I am going to stick with the Wok as I am sure they wouldn t put a Rendang in a pressure cooker useful though they are.",

Also make sure you take it off the burner when it still has plenty of liquid...the sauce pairs excellently with the white rice.",
