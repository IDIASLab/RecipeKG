Taking a queue from other reviews to cut fat and calories and use up more of my prolific rhubarb, I used 2 c. rhubarb, plain greek yogurt + 1 tsp vanilla, instead of vanilla yogurt and substituted 1/2c applesauce for the oil. The combo made 12 perfectly sized muffins that were moist, perfectly tart with that nice crunch from the topping (w/double the oats!). Next time I'll try substituting a flax meal for some of the white flour and boost the nutrition even more. These are a keeper!",

As I do in all muffin recipes I added 1/8 cup each ground flaxseed meal and wheat germ subbed applesauce for the oil and used Splenda (brown sugar) baking blend. I also upped the baking soda salt and cinnamon to 1 tsp each. Used a whole 6 oz container of french vanilla yogurt and subbed unsalted butter in the topping because I had it on hand. The topping is absolutely fabulous and just the right amount - I will definitely try the topping on my other muffin recipes! I added the rhubarb to the wet ingredients instead of the dry don't think it adversely affected the results though. I made mini muffins in a dark pan baked at 325 for 17 min. So yummy! I think you could successfully sub pineapple for the rhubarb too.",
