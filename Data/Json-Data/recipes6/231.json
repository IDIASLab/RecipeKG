I also just mixed the honey in with the milk, but I liked that it still wasn't too sweet. After taking it from the fridge, I wasn't too happy with it at first. The chia seed texture was just so odd. The seeds were a mix of a gel and crunchy texture which did not work for me. However, I decided to stick the pudding in the vitamix to whip it up. I normally use chia seeds in smoothies with no problem. It made the pudding nice and smooth at about 30 seconds on high. Chia seeds are so good for the stomach and I have not had any indigestion, today, which I normally do. I will definitely make this again, but double it to get more than 2 servings, and definitely blend it all together again when it is done chilling in the fridge. ty",

Allow the mixture to sit at room temp for an hour versus 30 mins to speed up liquid absorption (the seeds swell faster at warm temps).

The seeds didn't get soft enough so there were crunches here and there. I also didn't like that no vanilla is added as I feel it gives it a fuller taste. However I did add some chia seeds to the \"Chocolate Cornstarch Pudding\" recipe also on this site while cooking and it actually turned out very good! The chia seeds were completely soft and turned out like tapioca the pudding was thick and the taste wasn't compromised. This recipe here is just okay but if you're looking to add a health boost to a yummy pudding I recommend using the traditional cooked cornstarch pudding and just throwing in some chia seeds.",
