And the chicken was delectably tender. Maybe cook the chicken and carrots for 7-8 minutes cool immediately and then add the onions and peppers give it a stir and cook it another 7-8 minutes. Otherwise my first taste of a Polynesian style chicken was a wonderful experience. Thanks for sharing!",

I have had my pressure cooker for a while but always forget to use it so I was excited to use it again. Just as easy--and quick--as I remembered! I thought the chicken and veggies were cooked perfectly but I browned the chicken first then dumped in the veggies gave them a quick stir added in the liquid then popped the lid on and let it rip. This does make several servings so I wish I'd made more rice but I can easily make more for the leftovers. I didn't add cornstarch and all that--just dredged the chicken in flour and called it a day. There is a lot of liquid sure but it absorbs into the rice. I thought hubs might be unhappy with the vinegar flavor of this but he didn't really complain at all. I loved it and look forward to making it again. Thanks for the recipe!",

The sauce/liquid was far too loose/soupy. The flavor was incredibly sweet this was after I doubled the red pepper. I'm finding it a bit better after draining the liquid and adding soy sauce to my rice. This is just not very good. Far too many things to tweak for it to be even worth the effort.",
