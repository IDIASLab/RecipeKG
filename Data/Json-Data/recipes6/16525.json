The dough came together beautifully (I've been having such issues with that lately) and rose like a champ. It's baking now, but I'll update after we've cut into it at tomorrow's breakfast. EDITED: Excellent bread. I liked that it wasn't overly sweet. The raisins add a nice touch. I couldn't wait for it to cool fully, I ate a piece warm with butter. Heavenly.\nCut well even warm, didn't fall apart like most cinnamon breads do. Perfection.\nTIP: You might want to oil the pan down and make sure both sides of the loaf are oiled. It's a stickier bread, which means when it rises, you'll have a heck of a time getting it off the saran wrap if you don't. EDITED AGAIN: The vanilla glaze from this site is wonderful drizzled over warm slices of this bread. Just like a cinnamon roll!",

Set aside.\r\nDissolve 2 tsp. yeast and 1/2 tsp. sugar in 1/2 c. warm water - 95-105 degrees.  Proof for 10 minutes or until foamy. \r\nMelt shortening in 3/4 c. water and 1/4 milk. Cool.\r\nPut salt, rest of sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon in large bowl.  Add cooled milk mixture and proofed yeast. Stir together. Stir in flour until batter leaves side of bowl.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface.  Knead in remaining flour adding 1/2 - 1 cup extra flour if necessary. Knead about 6-7 mins. adding in the raisins during the last couple of minutes of kneading.  Place in lightly oiled bowl. Turn dough over once in bowl to oil top side of dough. Cover with thin dishtowel and place in warm place to rise 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hrs. Punch down.  Separate dough into two halves.  Roll out each half of dough into rectangle (roughly 8 x 10\").  Spread with softened butter and sprinkle with cinnamon brown sugar mixture (I doubled the filling).  Roll each rectangle up tightly and seal ends and fold under.  Place each rolled up dough in prepared pans, place towel over pans, let rise for another hour.  Bake as directed in recipe.",

You never need to add more flour than a recipe calls for, when it stops sticking and starts slapping the side of the bowl, it is ready to rise btw.  For the swirl, I used 1 egg(egg holds your sugars without splitting your bread) and 1 tea. orange extract and brushed that over the bread.  Then, I sprinked my brown sugar (1/2 cup), cinnamon (1.5 TBLS), clove (1/4 tea), and nutmeg(1/4 tea) over the bread and let it rise again.  Baked it for about 35 mins (but the best way to tell is with a thermometer reading at least 190 degrees).  This way the best bread I've made (and I make some pretty decent bread), and I probably ate most of 1 loaf all by myself!  Enjoy!",
