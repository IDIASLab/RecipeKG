I did reduce the amount of bread crumbs to 1/2 cup to lower the carbs and added 1/2 cup of thawed califlower rice which didn't add or change the flavor of this meatloaf. I also added 1 clove of chopped garlic used all ground beef, omitted the pork,(didn't have it),1/2 cup of chopped onion,and reduced the amount of onion powder to 1/4 tsp, than added 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme because it goes well with most meatloaf recipes.
