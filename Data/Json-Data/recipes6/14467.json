You can make it using lemon-lime flavored soda instead of ginger ale, if you like.  Adjust the amount of soda depending on how strong you'd like the drink to be.",

When I made it before I bought peach schnapps which worked quite well. In fact we decided not to make it a slush but a punch. Now that I've found the recipe again I made it for a small New Year's Eve party last night this time making the slush and using wild berry schnapps. Out of this world! I'm not a drinker so I like something a little sweet but not too sweet. This is perfect. Thanks for giving the recipe back. I'll be sure not to lose it this time.",

Although next time I am going to try using more green tea; I could barely taste that except as a hint of aftertaste. To save on pans I brought all the water to a boil while stirring in the sugar then turned off the heat and steeped the tea in the sugar water. No reason to do them separate!",
