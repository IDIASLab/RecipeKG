When making the dough please do as instructed and let your fingers let you know how much flour to add--when we first made it we just measured 6 cups of flour--it yielded a very dense loaf that way. However if you start with the two cups of flour and keep adding until you have that \"moderately firm\" dough you will get a perfect loaf of bread that will rise beautifully and taste even better! We make this bread at least once every two weeks when we run out of store-bought bread and I am thinking of making it weekly--store-bought bread just isn't this good! Thanks for the recipe!",

The slight tweaks I've made are as follows: I always proof the yeast first in the warm water by adding a generous pinch of sugar and letting it sit for 10 minutes. Seems to get a better result - maybe it wakes the yeast up? Secondly instead of shortening I use melted and cooled butter. Finally I mix in five cups of flour to the dough then mix the final cup in during the kneading process (the dough will start out fairly sticky). Great recipe!",

I can't believe it came from my own hands. I have been making bread for 8 years and no mix nor scratch recipe ever equalled this. It is unbelievable. I gave up my bread machine last year and am thrilled thrilled with this recipe. Nothing that I have tried has turned out half as good as this. The texture is light yet moist. Note that I did let it rise quite a bit longer before baking (I went shopping) probably 2 hours. Also in light of previous review I let the loaves rise in the oven so I started the oven with them in there at 400 (no pre-heat). I baked it for 40 minutes (again no pre-heat). Oh wow I don't even know what to say. Thank you Donna. Your recipe is the best!",
