As I was pulling the ingredients for this one the Nutella was right next to the PB practically staring me down. Once you spot the Nutella how is regular PB going to satisfy? It's not! So (Nutella in hand) I realize that a little cocoa powder will probably keep the Nutella from getting lost in the other ingredients. Awesome I had Hershey's Special Dark! I just subbed about 2 Tbsp cocoa powder for that amount of flour and subbed equal parts Nutella for PB. Dang! Using golf-ball sized scoops (flattened slightly works best) I pulled mine at 11 minutes; they were super tender and still moist inside but with a little chewiness. I love the crunch from the rice crispies and the slight crackling on the outside. I'm plotting additions of coconut pecans maybe even hazelnuts to hang out with the Nutella! Sorry that I don't know how they compare to the as-is version but Chocolatey Joe is my new best friend.",

First I tried half a cookie, for purposes of writing this review.  And then I finished it.  And then, throwing caution to the wind, I had another.  Yeah, that good.  First, they\u2019re pretty; all perfectly round and craggy looking.  That\u2019s a plus right from the beginning, as their appearance draws you to them. They are soft and chewy, but with an appealing contrast in texture with the \u201ccrisp rice cereal\u201d (aka Rice Krispies) and the oats. By the way, the submitter refers to both \u201ccrisp rice cereal\u201d and \u201cpuffed rice cereal\u201d in the recipe and of course these are two different things \u2013 I assumed her intent to be Rice Krispies.  They are buttery, peanut buttery and not too sweet \u2013 a good old-fashioned cookie jar cookie.  Try eating just one. (Note: I mixed these up using the conventional method \u2013 cream the butter and sugars, but not too long or your cookies will turn out flat, add the eggs and vanilla, mix in the flour mixture, to which I added 1/2 tsp. salt, and then the oats and Rice Krispies.  Then, chill dough a good hour before dropping on cookie sheets)",
