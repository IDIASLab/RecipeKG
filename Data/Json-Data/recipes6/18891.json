I cut the recipe in half used Splenda for the sugar and reduced fat sour cream which worked fine. Several reviewers mentioned that they thought the texture would be improved if some chopped berries were added to the puree so I incorporated that into the recipe...wise decision. The flavor is like a very decadent intense strawberry milkshake. If serving as a soup for an appetizer I'd recommend a small portion as this is pretty rich. I'm seeing more and more restaurants serving mini desserts in shooter glasses and I think that's a great and fun finish to a nice meal. We really enjoyed this served chilled more than hot but that's just a personal preference. However you serve it I don't think you'll be disappointed. Thanks Looobeee for a nice strawberry recipe.",

Next time I'll keep a portion uncooked for comparison as the simmering seemed to kill the wine and flatten the flavor a bit. I also recommend adding another cup of strawberries and chopping a couple cups of them so there's some texture rather than a straight puree. Might add a bit more wine too.",
