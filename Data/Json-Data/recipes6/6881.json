Also, I noticed that some of the changes they made to my wording when the edited my recipe made it more difficult to understand.  The Thyme is optional and the Thyme and Parsley should be finely chopped, not minced.  Also, to cook and stir is to saute. I've used sweet corn or shoepeg corn for this recipe and it's wonderful either way. You can also substitute chicken broth for the beef broth and add a little sage, or substitute seafood broth and add schrimp for some different flavors.  Thanks again!",

Dinner for me tonight was something I could never make if Hubs was home. Halibut? Nope he doesn t care for it. Corn? Not with his sensitive innards. This corn maque choux which I confess I was not familiar with was just the thing for me to make tonight with the halibut. Other than using chicken broth rather than beef and cooking it WAY less time than the directed (whoa!) 20 minutes I prepared this following the recipe fairly closely but not measuring precisely. It s a pretty dish with lots of flavor the humble vegetables enhanced and made better by I might add the bacon fresh thyme Creole seasoning and garlic. This turned out to be just the right choice to serve with Baked Halibut with Crispy Panko also from this site.",

I didn t have Creole seasoning so I made up Creole Seasoning Blend from AR to use in this dish. I had fresh corn that we froze during the summer so I used that instead of store-bought frozen corn. We loved everything about this dish from the saut\u00e9ed vegetables to the seasoning to the taste of the corn itself. I served this with hot ham and cheese sandwiches and a salad. I knew that there would be leftovers so I added the bacon right before serving so it wouldn t get soggy. Thanks Melody for sharing your recipe it is a keeper in our house!",
