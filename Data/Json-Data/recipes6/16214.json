I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 3 large overly ripe bananas, 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg, 1 whole egg in place of the egg whites, and used 1/3 cup unsweetened organic applesauce.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup the first time, but both my husband and I thought it was a little under-sweet, so I used 3/4 cup the second time and it was perfect and not too sweet either.  I mixed the wet ingredients and dry ingredients in two separate bowls and then added the wet ingredients to the dry.  I used an electric hand mixer on the lowest setting and mixed until JUST combined.  Sometimes if you over-mix a batter, it can become dense and rubbery.  The second it's incorporated together, stop mixing.  I baked it in a greased 9x5 loaf pan for exactly 50 minutes (I have a gas oven and it may make a difference as far as the cooking time) and it was perfectly done.  Soft and moist and delicious - and made the house smell so good while baking!",
