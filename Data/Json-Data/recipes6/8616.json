Several people said it was bland so I wanted to spice it up a little. Here are the modifiations I made: I completely omitted the water. I used one medium onion one green pepper and one red pepper. I used a can of enchilda sauce a can of chicken broth and a can of Rotel (the Mexican lime flavored kind). I also used a tad more chili powder and a dash of cayenne. It was very watery (despite using no water) yet did thicken as it sat. I served it with fresh cilantro Mexican cheese and tortilla chips. Next time I will have some limes on hand to squeeze some juice over!! It's very tasty and we enjoyed it very much. The way the original recipe is written is a little confusing because I was under the impression that everything is mixed together. But step 4 states that you serve the chicken over the rice. I was confused because I thought perhaps you were supposed to remove the chicken before cooking the rice? I cooked it by mixing everything together and served it in bowls and it was terrific. This is a keeper!!",
