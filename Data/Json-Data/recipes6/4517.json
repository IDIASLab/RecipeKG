It tasted like something you'd get from an authentic Indian restaurant! I didn't add the green onions or peas to the rice; I thought they would overcook so I added them to the lentil mixture just before I stirred in the rice. I also added a big handful of coarsely chopped cilantro at this point. I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable (it's all I had) and found that the lentil mixture took an extra half cup of broth. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. This is a delicious healthy and versatile recipe; next time I'm going to add some cauliflower florettes.",

This does take a bit of time to prepare...I realized after already committing to cooking this that I only had green lentils (ALWAYS have red lentils!!) and also had only red and yellow peppers!
