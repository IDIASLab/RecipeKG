I had to add a slurry of about 1 tsp cornstarch with 1 Tbs of water to the sauce to get it to thicken and we all thought it could benefit from a squeeze of lemon juice.  The pork was almost perfect as written, except I think next time (and there WILL be a next time!) I will season the pork itself with the salt and pepper instead of adding it to the flour.  Additionally, the paprika all sifted down through the panko crumbs, making the last piece of pork end up with the majority of the paprika on it, so next time I'll add the paprika to the flour instead.",
