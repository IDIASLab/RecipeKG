        "description": "The base of this soup used to be a roux-thickened chicken broth with milk and cheese added. However, since becoming vegan, I had to adapt, and I'm proud to say that this version is thicker and creamier than the original, and it was all achieved without a drop of flour or milk. It's not only the best vegan corn chowder recipe I've had, but it's just plain the best corn chowder ever. Even my non-vegan family loves it, and they request it regularly. This recipe makes a lot, but it keeps and freezes very well.",

Added Salt and Pepper to taste and topped with shredded sharp cheddar cheese.With modifications this did not make more than 6 hearty bowls. Chunky and satisfying!",

When it came time to mix the cashews with the broth I just dipped out some of the broth from the slow cooker and boom - done! The one thing I didn't use was the nutritional yeast simply because I couldn't find it at the store. I do intend to make this again so I'm going to scope out some health food stores and hope I find some. I also used fresh thyme because I had some and needed to use it. I scaled down the recipe to 6 servings and it still made a LOT so keep that in mind when making this. Finally I had to use half sweet potatoes and half red potatoes because that's all I had in the pantry (still rather tasty!) Nice winter soup - thanks!",

I used raw cashews and they added a creaminess without making the chowder taste particularly nutty. I tried to make my work easier by slicing all of my veggies in the food processor but the pieces weren't especially attractive so I pureed everything except the 6 c of corn. This made my soup less attractive but it sure tasted good. Next time I'll aim for a prettier soup with nicely chopped veggies. I used a slow cooker for convenience as was suggested by another reviewer. My husband ate two big bowls full and kept talking about how good the chowder was! Thanks!",
