I've been making it for well over 25 years but haven't added the nutmeg, will do that now.  \nThe only things I do different is use margarine/butter in place of the shortening and take corn flakes, put them into a one cup measuring cup, crush them down with my hand until I have a cup, then sprinkle on the bottom crust before putting the apples (I use macintosh or cortland) on the crust.  It catches and absorbs the apple juices and no one would ever guess the bars contain cornflakes.",

I always use those in baking b/c they don't get mushy but this recipe turned out quite tart. Also, moisten some waxed paper to stick to your counter then lightly flour it and roll out the dough. This way you can just lift the wax paper, turn it over and peel it off your crust instead of trying to get the crust off of your counter in one piece. I do recommend the lemon juice/powdered sugar glaze as another suggested, be sure to taste for sweetness before drizzling. I found this recipe is easily halved for a smaller pan.",

                "reviewBody": "FANTASTIC Apple Pie recipe! No brown sugar? Use white sugar and drizzle a little honey inbetween apple layers. White sugar or honey doesn't hinder the taste and the honey adds a special flavor. Don't be scared to add a couple extra teaspoons of cinnamon it only makes it better. The thickness of your apple slices determines the texture of the filling: extra-thin (1 cm) slices for soft filling (almost apple-saucey) and thin (3 cm) slices for chunky apple pie. The fact this pie was in a 9x13 and not in a round pan was PERFECT for my situation - Im in Europe right now and wanted to share a traditional American recipe but didnt have a round pan for it! This recipe was the solution and was a fantastic treat at that. I've made it three times already! And the crust recipe is absolutely wonderful I've used it for quiches as well. Because this recipe has top and bottom crust you'll have to alter it a little: Just cut the amount of the ingredients for the dough in half and there you have a bottom crust for a perfect homemade quiche. (Just say no to ready-made pie forms!) Recommended: 'Belle and Chron's Spinach and Mushroom Quiche ' Note for dough: Keep dough cold!! Easier to work with and best on a cold marble counter top. Put the second half in the fridge when youre working with the first half. Use your fingers to cut in the shortening it works the best. And don't stop before its finished it needs about 3-5 minutes until its really thoroughly cut in well.",

Other than the logistics of manuevering the dough into a 9x13 I found the dough itself to be easy to work with. What dough isn't a pain to get into any pan perfectly?  I made sure that both layers of dough were over-lapping the pan and then I just pinched and tucked it under itself.  Any excess I cut away, rolled out and used a leaf or apple shaped cookie cutter and laid them on top for decoration. The 9x13 size makes it easy for family functions because you only have on pie to carry versus 2-3 individual pies. We love and I make it frequently.  I think I'll make it now.",

I cut the butter into tablespoons then toss all of it into the processor bowl and turn it on until it resembles wet beach sand. Then I put it in a bowl and add the milk/yolk mixture and kneed it together with my hands. After chilling it rolls like a dream. I've used it for all my pies for years. Thanks Nancy for sharing.",

                "reviewBody": "I have never rated a recipe with 1 star before but I don't think this one deserves more than that. First the dough was a gloppy mess after adding the egg/milk mixture so I had to add more and more flour to even get it to roll-out consistency. Second this calls for 10 apples - WAY too many for a 9x13 pan and the little amount of sugar it calls for. I would say it only needs half the amount of apples (I used Braeburn). Which brings me to the sugar - too little for all the fruit. AND this definitely needs some cornstarch or something in the filling to thicken it up. I was horrified that after baking time I pulled it out of the oven to see that there was boiling apple juice around the sides as that makes a soggy bottom crust. So I had to hold the pan over the sink and tilt it to run all the liquid out and at least a cup of it came out. THEN I was trying to cut and remove the bars (I made them as part of an order from my home baking business for a graduation party today) and it was a nightmare - the crust was slipping off the apples all the apples were falling out of the center and not staying together etc. If I had time to make something else and chuck this entire batch I would. It's basically like an apple pie except the crust is tasteless and the filling not very desireable either. Sorry will not make again or recommend to others.",
