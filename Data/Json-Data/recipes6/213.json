                "reviewBody": "These turned out dynamite!  Yet another excellent recipe from Chef John.  If you don't regularly watch his videos, you should!\n\nI made these per the recipe, but I couldn't get an Asian Pear.  After a bit of research, I found that a decent alternative is to use Kiwi. They both have the same enzyme that acts to tenderize the meat.  I am no expert, but I read that Kiwi has a stronger concentration of the enzyme, so doesn't need to marinate as long as with the Asian Pear.   I used 1 and 1/2 Kiwi peeled and quartered.  I went about 8 hours and the meat was nice and tender.  I don't think going 2-4 hours longer would have been any issue.  I can't say how much the Kiwi vs. the Pear changes the flavor profile (must be at least a little), but I think in either case, the kiwi or the pear is a subtle tone to the overall flavor.  The end result didn't taste a lot like kiwi at all.\n\nIf you've never tried them, I'd highly recommend it.  Very easy to make and really great flavor.  I also like how they cook very quickly since they are thin, and so no mystery as to whether they are cooked all the way through.  It's hard to screw them up.  Grill over direct medium-high heat and when they look good and charred on both sides, they're done.\n\nAlso be sure to follow the directions about drying the meat off after removing from marinade.  I did this, but will do even more thoroughly next time to be sure to get a really nice char.  Hard to get those nice crispy bits when the meat goes on wet.",
