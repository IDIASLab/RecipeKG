So I grabbed more cream cheese and made another 9\" pie and 12 little tarts. This allowed me to use up all the pumpkin mix. I also found that it was best to let the cheesecake part sit for a little bit before pouring the pumpkin over top. One comment I received from my friends was that the topping was really sweet. Might try cutting back on the sugar next time. Other than that great recipe!",

Next time I make it I will probably cut the topping amount in 1/2. Thanks a lot for sharing!",

I can see how you could easily make 2 pies with this recipe if you were using a regular crust. I love the taste of graham cracker with cheese cake so I substituted that in place of a regular pie crust. I also added a little more sugar to the cream cheese mixture. The pie turn out beautifully. The topping could easily be cut in half. I would recommend shortening the broiling for the topping. I almost burned mine after 1 1/2 minutes. Keep a close eye on it! I put it in the refrigerator to chill after cooling. I think you will be impressed with the taste and presentation of this yummy pie. It has a gourmet appeal to it when completed and it really doesn't take a lot of effort. Thanks for sharing such a special recipe.",

It was so good my husband was braging about it to evryone and my father in law called me asking me to make them one too because he heared it was so delicious. I made my own grham cracker crust and pre baked it. I feared it would be too hard by the time the pie was done baking but it was perfect and kept the nice crunch for a couple of days (we finished if by the second day). I put the pie in the refrigeratore before adding the pumpkin filling so the cheese cake will harden and won't float up. I would definitly make this one again and again",

Also I use salted butter and leave out the pinch of salt. I only needed to broil for a lil over a minute. Also cover the edge of your pie crust with either foil or a protector because it will burn. Also wanted to add that if you don't have the evaporated milk- you can use sweetened condensed milk and leave out the sugar in the pumpkin layer. Very good pie always a crowd pleaser!",
