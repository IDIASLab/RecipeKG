I didn't have any taco seasoning (although I scoured my cabinets) so I used some cumin and other spices for a homemade seasoning. My grocery store only had plain tempeh but I thought the flavor was great as-is. We topped ours with avocado salsa lettuce and sour cream and ate them on whole wheat tortillas. This is already in our weeknight rotation as a go-to dinner. Super quick the husband loves it AND it makes just enough for him to take the leftovers to lunch the next day. LOVE!",

I add some tri color peppers and jalape\u00f1o and instead of taco season I do some chili powder cumin cayenne pepper and may throw some fresh green onions on top. It's fun to play with the spices and add fresh veggies to make it a more balanced meal. I definitely recommend topping with salsa and guac or avocado. Thanks for the recipe!",
