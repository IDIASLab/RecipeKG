I used this recipe as a base and then altered it to my taste: I used all frozen fruit(strawberries, raspberries, & blackberies) and let them thaw for 30 min before using. I increased the sugar to 2/3 cup and the cornstarch to 1/4 cup. I added 2-3 tbs of lemon juice for tartness as well plus a little sprinkled cinnamon too. When placing the crust in the pan I suggest flouring the pan first to prevent sticking and also dusting a bit of the sugar/cornstarch mix in the pie crust before you add the fruit so the bottom crust doesnt get soggy. I cut a lattice top with the 2nd crust and brushed it with an egg wash (1 egg mixed with 1/4 cup cold water) right before baking. Baked for 20 min, then covered edges with foil to prevent burning, and baked until golden brown (30-40 min) THE BEST PIE EVER!!! There were NO leftovers! and by baking the whole thing in a disposable pie pan on top of a foil lined cookie sheet there were also no dishes!!!! ",

I love the pie, but it is too runny and the consistency of the filling made the bottom crust too soggy.  I just made a Strawberry-Rhubarb pie that is very similar, but called for a portion of the sugar-flour mixture to be layered onto the bottom crust before adding the fruit, and I would definitely follow that advice for this pie as well.  Other than that, it tastes delicious!",

I used frozen raspberries and strawberries and just let them thaw and drain (fresh blueberries).

Also - put a toothpick in the centre of your pie so that the foil doesn't bake into the crust.  Mine nearly did!",

The kind you drooled over sitting on the counter under the glass cover. This is just wonderful toe-curling comfort food goodness. I love the simple flavors of just the sweetened fruit - no cinnamon no butter no lemon etc. And perfect as written - no extra cornstarch is necessary if baked until bubbly and not cut until cooled! I also liked that it was not overly sweet. I paired this with \"Grandma's Secret Pie Crust \" which was obviously prophetic in how this turned out because if you didn't find this pie in that old fashioned diner you'd find it in your grandma's kitchen. Great combination of berries and just the right proportions of each. We just loved it simple as that.",

I decided that I was going to try to bake once a week and since I've not ever made a pie before I started with this simple recipe....I used 2 cups frozen blackberries and 2 cups frozen raspberries. I let them thaw out to refridgerator temperature and then used 1/2 sugar and 1/4 cornstarch. I baked it for a little over an hour until it got golden I let it sit overnight and today I cut it and PERFECT amount of cornstarch the piece popped out like perfection! THANKS!",
