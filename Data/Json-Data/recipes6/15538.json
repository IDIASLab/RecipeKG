                "reviewBody": "This is to answer the question on how to perhaps prepare this w/out a bread machine. So here goes:\n\n1. Take 1/2 cup of the water needed and heat until warm about 110-115 degrees F. Mix this with the yeast and the sugar. Allow to bubble in an oven on WARM for 20 minutes. \n\nIn the mean time mix together 1 cup of flour needed and the 1/2 cup instant mashed potato flakes, set aside.\n\n2. Melt the butter, salt and remaining water (3/4 cup) until WARM (see temp above) and add to the first yeast mixture. \n\n3. Then add the flour/instant mashed potato flakes to the liquids. Then, I would add the remaining flour as needed. \n\n4. Knead dough for 10 minutes, then set aside to rise until doubled about 1 hour. Once it has risen, punch dough down and let rest 5 minutes. Then, shape dough as you want, put in bread pan, as rolls in 9x13\" dish, etc. Allow to rise again, for about 45 minutes. Bake rolls at 375 for 20-25 minutes. Bake bread for 40-45 minutes or until done. \n\nGood Luck!",

I followed the suggestion of \"spooning\" the flour into the cup rather than scooping and I added 1/4 cup more water. I did make a couple of additional changes. I used 3/4 cup instant mashed potatoes and reduced the bread flour to 3 cups.  I wanted a bit more potato flavor.  I also added a teaspoon of minced garlic and 2 teaspoons of taragon.  I served this with minestrone soup on a cold snowy day! Great light loaf of yummy bread!!",

Started the machine....all was well. About an hour or more into the process saw the smoke pouring from my machine! Long and short I pulled the plug scraped the pathetically emerging goop into a bread pan and parked it in my oven (looks promising so far). The stuff had ballooned way over my machine's capability (1 1/2 pounds)....so I checked the recipe. I don't know how it was originally posted but my \"copy\" showed a serving size of 15 (no telling what size machine/loaf that would provide). So - my query & warning: there was no bread machine SIZE (of finished loaf) provided and I doubt my 1 1/2 pound machine should be able to feed 15. I probably needed to halve this recipe - but not being a bread baker (or bread machine user) I didn't think to analyze amounts. Do as I advise - not as I did! Be sure of your machine's capabilities!! I'll let you know if the transfer to the oven worked!",

This is the most fabulous bread I have tasted.. it's very moist inside and the inside has a slight texture of sourdough but not sour..a little chewy that makes wonderful sandwiches.. and the crust is crunchy.. it is my favorite white bread ever.. I needed to use an additional 2 tbs of water over the 1 1/4 cups of water.. and also used the seasoned butter/herb potato flakes..only because it was all I had available.... everyone enjoy....",
