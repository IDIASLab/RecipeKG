The basket only holds a few pieces at a time so this was quite a lengthy test. On the very last batch I got it right. I ended up reducing the temp to 350, cooking it for 5 minutes, flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes. Another helpful hint is to cut your bacon pieces in half prior to putting them in the basket. If you do not, the pieces that overlap never get as done as crisp as the parts that are not overlapping.",
