To make a darker and slightly more flavorful bread use dark/stout beer molasses and two TBS of instant coffee. Also suggest using two tablespoons of vinegar as yeast nutrient and dough conditioner. Boil the beer and cool before adding other ingredients. Boiling the beer sours it a bit for a stronger rye bread flavor. Three heaping TBS of sour cream will add a lot to the texture taste and shelf-life of the bread.",

I also subbed 1 c. flax flour for 1 of the cups of bread flour. anyway it still came out good. the only thing I'd change next time is maybe doubling the honey or adding a little sugar. It's got a great texture but w/ all of my changes it needs a little more sweetener.",
