I also will substitute some or all of the water for beef broth. I'm glad I read the previous review because I would have included the spice pakcet from the wild rice mixture and it would have been WAY too much garlic flavor. Overall we enjoyed it though even pleased 2 out of 3 kids. Thanks for the recipe!",

This recipe adds spices and the combination of worcestershire sauce gives a great flavor. My kids (ages 6 and 4) enjoyed it and since the meat is cut during prep time it saves time at the table. I added a 4-oz can of mushrooms drained. This recipe will feed two adults and 2 children under 6 twice. My hubby had seconds and we still have enough left over to have another meal. I think it would be great for a potluck. I served this with steamed broccoli and a roll.",
