I use half angus hamburger meat and half plain ground pork. I saute the onion and garlic but add finely chopped red and green bell pepper celery and carrot to it as well. I also substitute the breadcrumbs with panko breading (italian seasoned if you can find it). I also throw in a heaping handful of finely grated parmesian cheese to the mix. I add a little garlic powder salt pepper and oregeno to the mix too. All of these make an amazing flavored meatloaf.",
