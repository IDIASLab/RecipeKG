It will  mellow the acidity, but you won't lose the health benefits of garlic.  If you have a recipe with oil, try poaching in the oil (VERY low heat, please).  the garlic should not color; this will make the garlic nutty and sweet. It only takes 1-2 tsp.  This tip is from ATK's garlic mashed potato recipe. DELISH!",
