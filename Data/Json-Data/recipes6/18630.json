Also I believe the ratio of cream to milk should be increased to include more cream less milk to ensure creaminess and avoid graininess or \"iciness.\" This has potential as a starting point but needs adjustments to rate any more than two stars. I made the necessary modifications and came up with a 5-star lemon ice cream.",
