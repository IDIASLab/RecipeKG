This was not too salty not too winey just right. You'll have to cook the onions a long time to get them right (about a half hour) but that's important. The roasted garlic butter was a great touch.",

This was an easy tasty and unique approach to a classic soup. I was sceptical at first about adding red wine but the flavor it added was rich and hearty. I didn't have any beef stock on hand so I used 3 cups of chicken broth 1 cup of water and 2 beef bullion cubes. It turned out fine though perhaps a little salty. I'll try using beef broth (or just one bullion cube) next time. I used Gruyere to melt atop the soup which melts nicely and isn't a strong as \"Swiss\" cheese.",
