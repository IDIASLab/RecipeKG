I followed the suggestions of another reviewer and  used 1 cup of unsweetened apple sauce and 1/3 cup of oil instead of the full amount of oil, and the cake turned out moist and delicious.  I halved the sugar -- I think two cups would have been too much!  Indeed, the cake was still sweet, and I feel that I could have reduced the sugar even more, especially since we used cream cheese frosting.  This makes quite a lot of cake; in the future I may make halve the recipe and bake it in a loaf pan for our small family.  We served seven people and still ended up with leftovers for ten more!",

It worked out really well, I still followed what others said by cutting out some of the oil and substituting it with applesauce..I did about half and half.  I also added in some nutmeg and cloves.  If you do cut this recipe in half though you just have to remember to watch the baking time.. instead of 40-45 minutes, you only need about 30-35.    \nI frosted the cake with cream cheese frosting, covered the sides with walnuts, dusted it with a little cinnamon and everyone loved it!\n\nIm so glad i came upon this recipe, I looked long and hard for one that i would be able to reduce easily and that didnt have any pineapple!
