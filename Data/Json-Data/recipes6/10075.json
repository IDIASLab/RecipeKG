I added 1-1/2 cups of vegetable broth (not 2) and this still was too thin for me; you literally could drink it. I did use reduced fat sour cream and Greek yogurt. It does have good taste so if I make it again I definitely will cut the vegetable broth in half maybe more. Also I typically eat smaller amounts of cold soups like not a soup bowl. Considering that this made way more than 4 servings in our house (made about 2-1/2 pints) so depending on much you normally serve you may want to take that into consideration. That's not meant as a negative remark I just ended up with more than I would have liked.",
