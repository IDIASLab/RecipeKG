I wasn't able to find a fresh Thai chile pepper so I used a tablespoon of chile garlic paste instead. If you do that use two tablespoons. One wasn't enough heat. This salad was good but I want to mention one important thing. IF you have to go out and buy all of the ingredients for this it is an expensive salad. I had a lot of things including all of the fresh herbs it calls for. If you don't have them it is going to be one expensive salad for two. Good but expensive.",
