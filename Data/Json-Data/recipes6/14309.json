The flavor was a little milder than I was expecting but still very tasty. Kids might want something sweeter but this is just the thing for those coffee-and cravings.",

Since the mango is so fresh I didn't use any spice and hoped to get the original mango fragrance. Unfortunately the natural flavor and fragrance were gone after baking. The custard became very plain I have to say. As a result I topped the pie with more diced fresh mango and it turned out not bad. It's important to keep this pie in the fridge at this hot summer. Or the custard will turn too soft and the mango will collapse down.",
