I cooked strips of 3 fresh chicken breasts in a skillet, generously seasoned with cumin, chili powder, salt and lime juice. Adjust those to your preference. Pretty well followed the rest of the recipe as it is. The juice from the chicken made the recipe extra saucy. I had a whole 9x14 pan full of enchiladas and only 2 were left. Sooo good as leftovers too!",
