The texture and taste have to compliment the dog using smaller amounts so it won't explode all over your face. This chili is our perfect double-dog-dare-you chili for use on hot dogs. Yes, they are hot dogs, not franks. Franks lived in France from the third to the fifth century on the banks of the Rhine River. If you must call them something other than hot dogs, try 'weinahs,' that works for us in the north.",

I also used beef bouillon packets not cubes. The cubes have a lot more salt. Maybe this was why I just didn't have the salt issue. I didn't get the bitter taste either. Can't figure that one out.

I halved the recipe and it made A LOT so keep that in mind.",
