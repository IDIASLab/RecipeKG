Had this dish many times in resturants and my family said this was even better than the resturants. I really only did a couple things different. My chicken breasts are ussually big so I split them and beat them for tenderness. I seasoned the flour with salt, pepper and garlic instead of the chicken. Doubled the wine and lemon(since I had more chicken and we love sauce). At the end I thought the sauce was a little thin so I thickened it up with a teaspoon or so of cornstarch just so that it was a little bit thicker. Great recipe though, thanks Mel!",

As I was too lazy to go shopping, I added onions, a little jalape\u00f1o, and a dab of honey to the butter lemon sauce and pur\u00e9ed it a bit. I also used some of the lemon zest. Served it over rice with some steamed broccoli. Absolutely delicious! Will be making this again.",

I seasoned the flour with a little smoked paprika & granulated garlic & switched out the regular lemons for Meyer lemons since they are less acidic and a touch sweeter. I also doubled the white wine and added 2 tablespoons of honey. No capers in my house, either! Holy cow this turned out fantastic! The Meyer lemons really upped the flavor of this already tasty dish.",
