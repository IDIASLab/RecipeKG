I substituted most of the lemon juice with lime juice (as I didnt have lemon). I messed up the crust and only added 1/2 the required butter so the crust on mine was kinda dry and falling off the cake. I give this 5 stars though really feel it's 4 1/2. It's good but a bit rich! But it is soooo easy. Mine was ready to eat within a couple of hours:)",
