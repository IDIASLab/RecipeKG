Well my experience with this grapeseed crust was less than stellar. Firstly the grapeseed oil never froze to any degree of hardness at all. I left it in my freezer for 24 hours too(my freezer does work). It stayed a cold thick liquid. Ok bad for a flakey pie crust. Secondly 3/4 cup oil was way to much oil for the amount of dry ingredients.",
