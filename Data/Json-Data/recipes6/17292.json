The 2nd time, as suggested by others, I did 2/3 cup each of oil and applesauce, and it was so moist and wet, like a pudiing cake.  The pineapple adds a lot of moisture, so decreasing the oil is ok.  So ever since,  I've used 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce.  Whatever you decide to use (oil, applesauce)just decrease the overall amount to 1 cup. I bake it at 350 degrees (instead of 325) in two 9\" cake pans for exactly 30 min.  Turned out perfect.  I use ALL light brown sugar. Drain/squeeze out all of the pineapple juice before adding to the batter.  (8 oz. pineapple = 1 cup)  Will definitely make again.  Super moist!  (4 star original recipe, 5 star with very slight change)  Will be my master recipe.  Use Cream Cheese Frosting II for a layer cake.  If you like heavy frosting, you might need to use 3 packages of cream cheese.",

The cake was very moist and I made a cream cheese frosting for it that consists of 4 oz. of cream cheese 2 tbsp. butter 1 tbsp. of milk 1 tsp. vanilla and 2 cups of confectioner's sugar. Make sure that the cream cheese and butter are soft when mixing. I got rave reviews from everyone for this cake and I will definately make it again.",
