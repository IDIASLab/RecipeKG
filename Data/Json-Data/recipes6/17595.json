It made it super easy to spread in the pan. Second, I substituted slivered almonds for the pecans. Third, I added 2 T almond extract to the batter...the house smelled wonderful as it cooked for about 50 minutes. Be sure to use fresh blueberries so you don't get the bleeding from frozen blueberries. Thankfully, they are in season now so 2 cups should cost about $2.50. Overally, a great recipe - one that I am sharing at a potluck tonight with friends.",

I cooked it on 350 for approx. 50 minutes, just keep checking it to make sure you do not overcook it. I used blueberries I had frozen as I pick lots each year. Do not unthaw the berries. I put on a papertowel to absorb the frost if there is some. I then mix them with 1-2 tbsp flour very gently. This really does make a difference when baking with frozen blueberries. I will make this cake from now on.  Debra\n ",

(i also nixed the cinnamon in the streusel just cause that seemed sorta outta sorts with blueberry to me) just remember to try not to mix too much before incorporating the blueberries and to throw the batter into the pan directly afterwards so the berries don't have time to settle out last variation i can attest to is using a tube pan and layering the streusel on top about 5 or 10 minutes before the cake was done after the cake had set sufficiently so that i didn't deform it (unlike the first time). returning the cake to the oven for the last 5 or 10 minutes. then you need to do a bit of flipping to serve streusel-side-up but it's pretty resilient stuff",
