I made mine with two VERY large Gala apples and didn't want to shred them so I just minced them really well. I also used cheddar instead of Swiss just because I had a bag of cheddar I had to get rid of. I didn't know how much 4oz. would be so I added a good large 3 or 4 handfuls of the cheese. And I definetly recommend spraying or greasing the pan pretty well in response to a previous reviewer. I did and it slid out no problem. Even with my changes the flavours blended subtely and beautifuly especially with the whole-wheat flour in there. I plan on making this again and again and I'll definetly try with GrannySmith and Swiss considering I put those on wraps for breakfast!",
