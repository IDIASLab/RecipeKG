After putting all the ingredients on the chicken, place in a covered roasting pan 40 minutes on 400, then uncovered for another 30 to 35 minutes, and it was delicious.

After browning the bird, I tossed in the garlic, returned the bird to the pan, then added halved white potatoes, a yellow onion quartered, and two carrots cut into large pieces.  I then added the remaining ingrediants for the original recipe, topped the pot with the lid and put into the preheated oven.  This chicken as small, so it cooked in about an hour, and the aroma that filled the house was amazing.  I let the bird rest for ten or so minutes before removing from the pan.  I put the veggies in another bowl to serve alongside, and to make a quick gravy, added a can of campbell's wild mushroom condensed soup mix to the butter/garlic/olive oil drippings.  My husband loved the meal.  Thanks!",

I browned the chicken in the pan with the butter and olive oil, then just added the spices and the lemon juice and water straight into the bag with the chicken, then added the garlic to the pan to start extracting the flavor and then added that to the bag  well. After the chicken was finished cooking, I took the bag out and dumped the contents into a bowl and mashed the garlic and mixed that up. It made a perfect sauce for the chicken.
