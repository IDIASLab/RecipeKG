It has a nice thickness to it and a very delicious kick to the sauce. We ve used this on burgers pulled pork chicken and French fries. Of all of the barbeque sauces I have made this version is my son s favorite. He now lives out on his own and asked me to make it for him so that he doesn t have to take my bottle home with him! Thanks TasteKing for sharing your recipe it is almost time for me to make another batch. This recipe is definitely a keeper!",
