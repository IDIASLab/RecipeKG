                "reviewBody": "I ALWAYS use this recipe! the reason everyone is having problems with this icing is simple: depends on how soft your butter is...the softer butter gives you a soft consistancy even if u start with hard stick of butter its easy to over mix and it melts...also melts in a hot kitchen if you're baking a lot. You WILL have to tweek this recipe every time u make it..because of this...ALSO..if u sift the powdered sugar it will change the ingred. slightly so i always add milk last in ver small amounts to get it where i want it to be...you can also add about a tsp or so to your liking to get a glossier icing that spreads easier...i also add more cocoa cause i fiend for chocolate lol. which also means more butter more milk more sugar to get it the consistancy i prefer. you can also tweek it to 1/2 shortening and butter for more of a store bought taste...i also add vanilla to this recipe. different variations..but all the same recipe in general. its just what u prefer.",
