I wanted to try it anyway and so what I did was pureed the plums I had and used that instead of the applesauce. The other things I did different was I  used 2/3 part white flour and 1/3 part whole wheat rather than 50/50, I did add 1 t. vanilla and baked it in a bundt pan, rather than flour the pan I  sprayed it good then dusted it with a little sugar/cinnamon (about 2 t.) this gives it a nice little crust. It did not need to bake as long in the bundt pan so I kept a close eye on it. A very good moist cake that is a bit healthier than some.",
