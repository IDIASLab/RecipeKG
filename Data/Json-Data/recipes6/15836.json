I even used water instead of orange juice since I didn't have any and the flavor was just orangey enough. The texture was deliciously perfect. If you're having problems with the texture consider switching to \"Metric\" up above in the \"Servings\" section and weighing your dry ingredients especially your flour. It will make the baking process much more foolproof. Plus it's a lot easier on clean-up...just place your mixing bowl on the scale press tare pour your ingredient to needed weight press tare pour your next ingredient etc. No need for measuring cups let alone scooping and leveling and getting flour and sugar everywhere. I've converted all of my recipes...just because I like less cleanup!:)",

I read all reviews first and used just 1/2 the orange peel reserving the other half in case I wanted to add more but didn't need to. These did have a very nice orange flavor. Put the eggs juice sugar dates and orange in my food processor. I thought at first I had added too much powder or soda because it had that 'fizzy' look and texture but realized it was just reacting with the acid in the juice. Subbed some of the oj with fresh pineapple juice and they still had very nice orange flavor. The problem I have with this is #1. not really sweet enough so would be more like a breakfast muffin. I intend on glazing them w/some 10x sugar mixed with oj and zest to help with this. #2. I was alarmed when I saw one reviewer mention the word 'pudding' like texture. I found I had to bake them a bit longer to get rid of that spongy pudding like texture and it didn't completely. Added 1 tsp. cinnamon 1/2 tsp. each of allspice and nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. cardamom. These blend of spices were complimentary. Very good flavor but just lacking in sweetness and the texture.",
