Wanted to be sure I was correct in making this statement so I had a bottle of Hidden Valley Ranch in the fridge and did a taste test on it. Regardless it's still a very nice salad dressing with good flavor and I LOVE the way it breaks down nutritionally. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

This is definitely a \"clean\" recipe but it turned out very watery even though I followed the ingredients to a T and the flavor was very bland. I may try using fat-free sour cream (Trader Joe's) and adding more garlic and onion powder then see how that turns out. Will return for an update.",
