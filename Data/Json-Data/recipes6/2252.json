Sliced it partially frozen, as thinly as I could, and the beef was so tender it just about melted in my mouth.  The broth has the perfect combination of ingredients and is so flavorful.  You definitely know it\u2019s Asian, but it doesn\u2019t reach up and smack you in the face either; subtle may be a good word.  With all of the veggies and pasta, it is a thick soup (I liked that), but if you\u2019d prefer a thinner consistency, you certainly could just add more beef broth.  Islandartist, fabulous soup, LOVED everything about it.",
