Now, ladies... if your husband is like mine and his weakness is cinnamon rolls, get ready for a fun night!\n\nHint: I doubled the filling because I wanted a very sweet roll with a strong cinnamon flavor, added about 1 tsp. vanilla (this addition gave it a wonderfully floral after taste), and used white sugar because I didn't have brown sugar, then glazed the tops with 1/2 filling mix and a few Tbsps. of corn syrup.  It was ooey-gooey sticky!!!  Becareful not to overwork the dough...I came close but I was fine.\n\nMmmmm...SO GOOD!",

I used a lot more cinnamon than called for + a sprinkling of nutmeg and cut the rolled log using thread. Also made a cream cheese frosting, which I assume was implied. I had to wait longer than 45 minutes between setting to rise and baking, so they were HUGE and really jammed in there!

They came out dry - I think 400 degrees for 20 minutes was too long. Surprisingly, the 1 Tbs cinnamon was a little too much (I honestly didn't expect that, because I really like cinnamon, and I realize this is subjective). Also they didn't rise enough in the frig overnight, but they did rise fine on the counter top when I took them out for about an hour before baking. I'm not going to say this was no good, but maybe it needs some tweaking and practice for my family & our tastes. Thanks for the recipe, though! I enjoyed trying it out.",
