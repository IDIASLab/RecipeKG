I think I've gotten pretty good at making this dish but it still doesn't compare to my father's! Don't be fooled by the ingredients. Most are optional and this is easy to make! Great for parties as appetizers or a main dish.",

I only made a few changes, lightly toasted the bread before adding the shrimp so that it won't get soggy, didn't used the yellow onion, but increased the green onions and baked the toast for 5-7 minutes in a 350 degree oven instead of frying to cut down the fat.  Add some red peper flakes for a little bit of heat.",

I am at a loss to understand why people baked this rather than quick deep-fried it, because deep-frying made such a difference in flavor.  To bake shrimp toast isn't really shrimp toast at all.  And eliminating all the essential fatty acids in one's diet isn't good for the body, especially the brain and nervous system.  And people are still using margarine for the sake of \"less fat\" when it is the equivalent of plastic?  It hasn't lengthened anyone's life in my profession, just made it more miserable.",
