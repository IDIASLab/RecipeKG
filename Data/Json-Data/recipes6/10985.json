First time I baked it, I used a 9x13 pan it was a little on the dry side, and it had air pocket holes throughout the cake...still delicious though.  Second time I made it I added a bit more milk, used a donut cake pan and tapped the pan on the counter a few times before I put it in the oven... needless to say I almost ate the whole darn cake myself!!  Delicious, moist and no air pocket holes.  I used a butter icing on the cake and it was to die for!!!",
