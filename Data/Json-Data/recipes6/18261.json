This came out very similar to my regular eggless chocolate chip cookie recipe (basically the toll house recipe using egg replacers). They came out lighter in color and took a couple more minutes than the baking time in the recipe indicated. The only change I made was using non-fat vanilla yogurt because I didn't have plain. I only used 1 tsp of vanilla extract because of this. Out of the oven they were delicious -- a little crisp on the surface and soft and chewy inside. They didn't flatten as they cooked and remined domed though they did spread a bit. I look forward to seeing how they taste in a few days (a problem I've had with my eggless cookie recipes is that they fail to stay moist after a couple days).",

I did adjust it a little from reading the other reviews. I used butter instead of margarine and shortening and added an extra teaspoon of vanilla. They were really really good. I under cooked them a little bit so they were soft instead of crispy. My nephew devoured them and so did everyone else. It's so hard to find a good recipe that uses something else in place of eggs but this was definatley it. Thank you.",

I altered the recipe slightly, decreased the following just slightly : margarine (I used 3/4 stick of margarine and no shortening), and sugar. I slightly increased the following: brown sugar, yogurt, vanilla, and flour.\nMy cookies also needed a little extra time, but they were still soft and simply perfect.\n\nPerfect for anyone with egg alergies or desire for delicious healthy cookies!\n\nWarning: very addictive.",
