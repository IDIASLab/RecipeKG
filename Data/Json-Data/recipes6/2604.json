With that being said I made exactly as written with the exception of hazelnuts. My local grocery store doesn't carry them and we don't particularly like nuts in our salad so I just left them out. This recipe is really good. The coffee spice rub was amazing! Fennel is one of those things you either love or hate. In my opinion this would be just as good if you substituted baby spinach for the fennel if you do not care for fennel. Plan ahead and give this one a try!",
