I make this when I want a delicious, elegant meal and serve it with wild rice and a nice bottle of wine. I always triple the sauce, which is easily done using an 8 oz carton of cream and 1 cup of marsala wine, leaving out the milk. Also, I use double the mushrooms and I use sweet onions instead of green. I simmer it longer till the sauce reduces and thickens to my liking. The cream is the key in this recipe, I can't imagine a chicken marsala recipe without cream in the sauce. I love to make this for guests, it gets raves and I look like a gourmet cook!",

I never use the onions it changes the flavor too much.  I do use roasted garlic sea salt and lemon pepper for seasoning.  This recipe calls for equal parts of marsala and cream but in my opinion it needs more marsala and much less cream for a caramel color and richer flavor.  With the bits from the cooked chicken and flour the sauce cooks down and thickens.  Add capers and voila! I double the sauce and serve over angel hair pasta.  Keep in mind it needs to be served right away. Buen Apetito!   =^..^=",

                "reviewBody": "Is it impossible to make an easy gourmet dinner in a flash during the weekday?  Not with this recipe!!!  Wow!  That is all I have to say.  Again, I am a purist and usually do the recipes as they are written the first time around.  The recipe was definitely very good as is and deserves all the stars.  If and only if you decide to \u201caugment\u201d it, here are my suggestions:\n1- Lightly dredge the chicken in flour before saut\u00e9ing it.  It gives it a little crust which I like.\n2- Remove the chicken from the skillet and reserve in a plate before step #2, and only put back the chicken after adding the cream in step #3.  This will ensure that the chicken is still tender.\n3- Triple the sauce (i.e. 1 cup of Marsala and 1 cup of cream)!!!  It is the best attribute of the recipe!  Since there will already be a lot of cream, you don\u2019t need the milk.  I just omit it now.\n4- Make sure you take the time to cook down the Marsala wine, which is why it should be boiled for 2 to 4 minutes as per step #3.  Marsala is a nice fortified wine but can be a little overpowering for kids and people that don\u2019t especially appreciate alcohol.\nThat being said, I\u2019ve served this over pasta, rice, and mashed vegetables and I\u2019ve only had rave reviews.\nThanks Sal!",

Every little bit of calorie and fat cutting counts.  In this case as in many when you use the evaporated milk in place of creams and regular milk products, you get all of the creaminess and not so much of the fat. It is also a real $$ saver. If you have champagne taste but only have beer budget, you will like this substitute. I promise! ",

In a side by side taste test, this one was definitely richer because of the cream. The one I made for myself had no cream. The flavor on both was way out of this world. Because of the cream sauce, the presentation was prettier on this one. I will use this recipe for guests and the other Marsala for my family dinners.
