We don't use cream, milk, garlic, onions or other strange ingredients; we use only guanciale, eggs, pecorino cheese, and lots of black pepper (carbonaro is the Italian for coal miner). This isn't the Italian-American version, it's the real, creamy carbonara and it comes right from Italy, where I live. Buon appetito.",

He asked me if it had cream in it...because an authentic carbonara does NOT have cream.  I assured him that it had no cream in it.  Once we started, he was a bit frustrated because I wasn't doing it \"his\" way but he still was a great help.    It turned out wonderful and he admitted that it was \"just as good as his\".   I looooooved it, and will be making it again.  It was VERY easy....and seeing the video before I made it ensured that I knew just when to add the egg mixture so that it wouldn't \"cook up some scrambled eggs\".   Thanks for the great, simple recipe!!!",

It made it more salty then I intended.  What I should've done is get it cut thick and cube it so that you get small pops of salty flavor.  When it is thin, it spreads out too much and gives too much salty flavor to it.  But still, I'll make this again!  I have to get the recipe right.  ;)",
