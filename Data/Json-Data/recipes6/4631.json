I also used fresh ginger, fresh thyme, and substituted the sage with fresh cilantro (I didn't have any sage).  I just added the thyme and cilantro after the cooking was finished, and before I began blending with my immersion blender.  The lentil soup went very well with some cooked brown rice (for a complete protein).  I couldn't get enough, and neither could my 2-year-old daughter.  Thanks, hot_curry!",
