I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts which were wonderful next time I'll use about 50% more than the recipe calls for because I like the crunch they add. Next time I'll add a pinch of salt or perhaps salt the pecans while toasting them. The texture of this was really perfect smooth and creamy instead of dry and grainy like a lot of fudge is. I also agree the presentation was lovely. Thanks for the recipe I will use it as is and try many modifications in the future!",

I upped the maple extract to 3 tsp only added 2 cups of white chocolate chips and I can still taste the chocolate clearly. After reading the other reviews that said their fudge came out too soft I used a candy thermometer to make sure the sugar/milk/butter mixture got all the way to 234 degrees. It boiled for much much longer (I live at a high altitude that might have been part of it as well). Either way the marshmallows and chocolate melted just fine and it cooled to the perfect fudge consistency. I also toasted the walnuts before I added them and that was very good.",

Turned out wonderful. Also made the recipe substituting (in a double batch) 2 cups semi sweet chips and 4 cups milk chocolate chips for the white chips. Made great chocolate fugde. Easier than Aunt Teen's Fudge. I like using the mini marshmellows instead of creme. The mixture boils quicker. Just have to do a lot of stirring after to melt everything. Will make this recipe often.
