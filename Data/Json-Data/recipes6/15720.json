If I had to use applesauce I would double the cinnamon in the recipe if not even triple.  I would also add a few dashes of all spice and about 4-5 shakes of cloves because I like my apple stuff with lots of spice!  I measure out the apple butter and cider and pop it in the microwave until it warms up to 110 degrees.\n\nI also use 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 bread flour trying to up the 'health factor' a bit.  I skip the butter and use canola oil. \n \nI don't measure the shredded apples I just used two-skin and all.\n\nI also added 3/4 cup of chopped pecans at my 'add in' beep of my machine.\n\n1 package of dry yeast equals 2 1/2 tsp of yeast.\n\nStand by your bread machine until this mixes a bit because, depending on the size/type/water content of your apples, you  may need to add some more flour.  I just spoon it over the dough until it looks and rolls around in a nice ball.\n\nWONDERFUL recipe.  This makes GREAT toast!",

I didn't have nutmeg so I used pumpkin pie spice--about a teaspoon and I also increased the cinnamon to a teaspoon. This bread seemed to me to want to have fruit in it so I added dried cherries in. I wish I'd added more! I also didn't shred the apple but chopped it and I like how there were some moist chunks of apple in the bread as a result. This is a nice bread for breakfast or pb & j sandwiches. Thanks for the recipe.",
