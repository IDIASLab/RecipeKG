If I have the time I make it over 2 days by making the broth from a ham bone onion any leftover vegetable etc. simmered for several hours. I toss all the junk in the now made broth except the ham. Let the broth cool in fridge or in my case on my porch in these cold days. Skim the fat. It's wonderful broth to use in place of the water and broth listed. I then use the rest of the ingredients from this recipe. If I don't have time I go with what's listed. You can't beat it and as other reviews say....don't skimp on the milk or cream!",
