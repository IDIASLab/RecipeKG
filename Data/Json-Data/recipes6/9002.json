Because it seemed like so much, I only used half, and even then it was overflowing into the pan as it cooked - and my squash was even a little bigger than the 2 pounds called for.  I'd probably start out with 2 tablespoons of butter per half, and add more after it's cooked, if needed.  I also halved the cinnamon because it seemed like a lot, and it was plenty.  I should have also halved the brown sugar because I found it too sweet.   I also recommend adding a sprinkle of salt to bring out the flavors. At 1 hour, the squash was already overcooked, then with 10 more minutes it was mushy.  A nice base of flavors, with some tweaks.",
