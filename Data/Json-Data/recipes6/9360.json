This was SHOCKINGLY good. I am a notorious chicken over-cooker and the texture of this ended up like an excellent rotisserie chicken. Flavor was great a really unexpected \"zesty\" balance of the mustard and lemon. Couldn't be easier either! Served it with a prewashed bagged salad and store-bought crusty whole grain bread. Everyone loved it! My husband kids and I say THANK YOU TERI for taking the time to submit this recipe.",

I did halve the amount of oil and used light mayonnaise to cut down on the fat but it was very tasty and good. The chicken was really succulent and the mustard flavour just right. I don't much like the lemon pepper that I have available - it tastes somewhat synthetic which was noticeable in the final dish. In future I will use regular black pepper and maybe a dash more lemon juice to balance it. I think that that will push it up to four stars for us.",
