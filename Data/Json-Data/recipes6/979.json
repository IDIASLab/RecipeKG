So I cooked down some (1 c.) fresh berries with a pinch of nutmeg and 2 tbsp of sugar and combined with 2 heaping tbsp of actual seedless strawberry jam. This gave a better texture in the fruit area. And in fact I will add even more fresh berries next time closer to the end to make the filling even chunkier) but I did have to cook it down quite a bit to get it to a jam consistency. I Will also add some ground almonds to the short crust AND the topping ( i will have to work out how much).",
