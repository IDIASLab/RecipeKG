I didn't at first and it was really watery and didn't taste very good. So I put the ricotta in a colander and put it on top of a big mixing bowl and let it sit over night in the fridge. Woke up the next morning and it was the perfect texture! I bought the shells because I was feeling lazy but this recipe is similar to the one we used at the bakery I worked at a long time ago so I will just assume it will be good haha",

I drained Sorrento brand ricotta (starts off drier) for 3 days in a sac I made of cheesecloth. It was the perfect consistency for piping through a pastry bag. Tasted wonderful! I skipped the mini chips and orange peel but on a few of them I dipped the ends of the shell in chocolate. My taste testers loved these plain or with chocolate!",
