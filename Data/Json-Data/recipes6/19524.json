The only things I changed about this recipe were additions: we like a little heat so I added some Vietnamese chili sauce and a little sesame oil. Marinated them for about 8 hours and they were great.

I didn't marinate it overnight like the recipe called for. I broiled the legs for about 20 minutes on each side then tossed them in the sauce. Cooked up nice and crisp. I didn't change much to the sauce other than cutting back on the chili sauce which I only used a tablespoon of. I also doubled the recipe. This turned out great. I used the drippings from the chicken in The Day Before Payday Fried Rice. Great meal!",
