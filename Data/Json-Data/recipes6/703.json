They didn't have the flavor I was hoping for and it was tough to get them to cook through without getting very brown. I might give them another try but I would probably go heavier on the cinnamon lighter on the flour I add and leave the syrup out to pour on top. They're an interesting idea but I think this recipe just needs another look to see if the ingredients are as written.",
