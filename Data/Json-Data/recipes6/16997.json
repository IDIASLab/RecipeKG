Our class tried out many different brownie recipes and our group was assigned this one. They tasted really good and didn't take long to make. Instead of baking a double batch, we just baked a single batch. We agree that it should be two batches because it's really small. Chocolate chips would be a good additional ingredient just to sweeten the brownies a little more. We chose not to add peanut butter to the recipe because we thought it would ruin the taste. The recipe was very delicious but we have made a few minor suggestions for next time. Thanks!\r\nFrom, the Muffin Girls\r\n-Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.",

I gave them four stars due to some changes.... 1 cup sugar because some said they needed to be sweeter. 1 egg rather than 2 because that made them fudgier and 1/4 cup p-butter to compensate for the lack of one of the eggs. Also I used dark choc cocoa because that is what I had. They turned out very fudgy and dark and tasty. By the way the batter was very thick like cookie dough.",

Well I came on to ALLRECIPES.COM and looked for brownies.  I found these luckily. (We were out of butter and milk)  And decided to make them.  I made a double batch.  These are really great because they are not over sweet!!! I made the double batch less than 12 hours ago and they are gone.  There are only three of us living in the household!!!! Try these and you will love them.  This recipe has broken me from ever buying store bought again!!!!  Congrats!!!!",

I doubled the batch as suggested by others I even added a little extra oil just in case and removed them from the oven earlier than suggested. The batter was extremely thick which should have warned me but I thought I would give the recipe the benefit of the doubt. I made a double batch of peanut butter frosting which was the best part. I was very disappointed and wasted a lot of ingredients. My husband took one bite made a face and put it back on his plate. He loves \"cake style\" brownies but these ruined it for him. My reccomendation try another recipe don't bother trying to tweak this one.",
