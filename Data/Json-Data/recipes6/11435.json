Here are the changes I made: 1 cup white sugar, 2 large bananas, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 1/2 cup butterscotch chips, used baking SODA instead of baking powder, and sprinkled powdered sugar on top after it cooled. Baked at 350 for 40 minutes in an 8x8 pan. Everything else was the same as the original recipe. The cake came out super moist, thick (not thin), and tasted delicious. I will definitely be making this again!!",

I was invited for dinner and wanted to bring something.  Everyone seemed to like this.\r\n\r\nChanges I made:  I used two large bananas, which equaled about 1 1/2 -2 cups mashed bananas.  I used one full cup of sugar because usually banana bread isn't sweet enough.  I added about one teaspoon of vanilla.  I also used about two handfuls of milk chocolate chips.  I don't like the semi-sweet.  I had no complaints and the chips really gave a good twist to regular banana bread.  With the additions, it was plenty sweet and very, very moist.  I had to bake it the full 35 minutes, almost 40 minutes, due to the additions.  As a rule, I always set my timer about ten minutes early because you never know about your particular oven.",

I did add 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  And I used baking soda not baking powder.  All homemade cakes call for baking soda, it works much better than baking powder as a leavener.  For example, I made a homeade chocolate cake and by accident used baking powder instead of baking soda, and it came out very thick like brownies.  When I made that same cake again, I used baking soda and it was a cake consistancy.",
