Traditionally, they are prepared during the holiday season, but deep freezing makes them available year round.  Be sure to wash any surface and your hands thoroughly with a bleach solution to avoid contamination while handling raw chitterlings.

There are two rules that must be adhered to up front:\n1.\tIf your chitterlings stink before and during the cleaning process they are fresh!\n2.\tIf your chitterlings continue to stink while cooking, they are not clean enough!\n\nTwo soakings in cold water does not cut it, for chitterlings to be clean they should be almost as transparent as a wet paper towel when held up to the light. Use vinegar and plenty of it during the entire process of cooking chitterlings, remember these are the intestines of an animal as to minimize the potential of contamination of your chitterlings all caution must be observed. Keep your hands clean during the process, (recommend you cut your fingernails short as well). \n\nChitterlings like greens; make water\u2026..do not fill the pot up to the brink with water less you will have a pot that will overflow on the stove for sure. Depending on the number of pounds you\u2019re preparing, the pot need not be more than a quarter ways filled with water. Remember also that chitterlings cook down, so the weight before cooking will dramatically be reduced after they cook. (15lbs of chitterlings cooks down to about 7lbs).\n\nNow comes the seasoning of the water:\n\n1 Onio",

I've never added onions but will try it next time. Mother added a potato to her chitlins to cut grease.  Also, the Sylvia Robinson recipe says to soak overnight in salt water to cut grease.",
