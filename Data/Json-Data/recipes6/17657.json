I used real butter, evap. milk and followed the recipe except for adding extra coconut and more pecans. Also, regarding the cooking time, the best tip I can give is to let it come to a full rolling boil, then it will begin making a 'smacking' sound as the bubbles pop. Let it 'smack' boil for at least 5 minutes, turn off heat, add other ingredients and you will have no trouble with it thickening. The eggs thicken it, like in a cooked pudding.",

                "reviewBody": "This Frosting is great. I have used this frosting for about 3 years now on my German Chocolate Cakes and it always turn out great. Here's what I do for the perfect frosting. \n\nFirst of all I use it on a 2 layer 9 inches round cake so I have to double the recipe because as it is written, it is not enough frosting for a 2 layer 9 inch cake.  I beat together the milk and egg yolks in medium saucepan, and then I stir in the sugar and butter. I stir with my whisk until the butter has melted, and then I put on my timer for 20 minutes. I continue to cook and stir my frosting over medium heat.  When the 20 minute timer goes off, I remove it from the heat and then I add my vanilla, coconuts and pecans.  Then I let the mixture rest for about 15 to 20 minutes before I try to spread it on my cake.  You will notice that when you take the frosting off the heat it will be a little runny but after you add the coconuts and pecans and let it rest it will thicken up.  If 20 minutes is not long enough for your frosting to thicken just let it rest until it gets to room temperature. You have to let the frosting rest for a while so it can thicken. Now you are ready to spread the frosting over the cake.  I hope this helps.\n\nBettye",

Add about three or four spoonfuls and then put that yolk mixture in the pan with the rest of the mixture\". Also I always remove the chalaza (the little white squiggly thing in the egg).
