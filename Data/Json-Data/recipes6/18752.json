She calls it \"Cherry Squares.\"  Her recipe calls for 1 Tbl. lemon juice, but other than that, this recipe is the same.  Mark the batter into 24 squares, and a good rule of thumb is to add about 3 cherries per square.  I sometimes make this with blueberry pie filling instead of cherry.  I love this recipe because if you have drop-in company, you can whip it up in no time, and I usually have the ingredients on hand already.  In fact, I keep a can of cherry pie filling on the shelf just in case I need to make this.  Thanks for the recipe!",
