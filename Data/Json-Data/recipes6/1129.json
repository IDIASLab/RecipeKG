The first time I made it we didn't have diced tomatoes so I cut up 4 whole tomatoes and that tasted better than canned. I didn't have beef base so I used one tablespoon of powdered boullion (for the halved recipe) I also substituted cooking brown rice for white boil in bag rice. The first time I only used one bag, and the second I used two. Both were good, but adding two bags made it heartier. Using fast rice cut cooking time by nearly half. This soup tastes better the second day too!\nEDIT: Even 2 years later this is a staple in our house, especially during the winter months.  I have since simplified the (halved) recipe to this:\n\n1 1/2 green peppers,\n1 medium onion,\n1-2 teaspoons minced jarred garlic,\n1lb ground beef,\n2 -14oz cans diced tomatoes (standard size can) undrained,\n2 -14 oz cans tomato sauce,\n1 regular carton beef broth,\n2 cups water (omit if you buy the 50% more free carton broth-combo of broth and water should be 6 cups),\n30 grinds of black pepper\n2 cups (when dry) white rice, cooked before adding to soup.",

Also use ground chicken or turkey with some ground chorizo (beef or pork) combined instead. Somewhat healthier and much more flavor also less grease. The last issue is this might call for a little too much sugar. Ketchup is already loaded with sugar so cutting the brown sugar in half might be just as good.",

The biggest one being that I used a box of Uncle Ben's Brown Rice & Quinoa Roasted Red Pepper instead of plain brown rice. I've gotta tell you that this added a ton of flavor and was quite delicious. I left out the brown sugar altogether because I knew it would make it too sweet for my liking. Lastly I added some celery for extra crunch. This is a recipe where you can substitute a little here and there and it is very forgiving. Thanks for sharing!",
