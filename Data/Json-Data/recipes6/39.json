I used bone-in chicken thighs from which I removed the skin (I hated to do it I love chicken with skin but I'm on a weight loss program). I didn't have any Italian seasoned bread crumbs so I used Panko and added dried oregano basil and thyme. At first I was hesitant to add Italian seasoning to an Asiany dish but I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't discard the marinade I boiled it down to a syrupy consistancy and served it over leftover Asian noodles with green onions. This was really wonderful and I can't wait to try it with skin-on chicken once I get skinny. Thanks so much simplylo!",

I used a whole cut up chicken and took the skin off (I don't like the skin and it's so bad for you anyway!). I also used low sodium soy sauce. That's the only changes I made. The coating on this chicken is just incredible. Oh and it's even better the next day...cold! Next time I'm going to make a boat load of chicken drummettes using this recipe. Can't wait!

I marinated the chicken for about 5 hours and breaded the chicken with the same recipe but since I didn't have wheat germ I used panko (I had it on hand and you can't get more Asian than that!) instead.
