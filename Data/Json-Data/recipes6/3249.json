One tip - I first cooked the chicken until it was still a little pink in the center as it would continue cooking when I set it aside & then when it was all mixed together. Doing that made the chicken extremely tender. Thanks for the yummy recipe!",

I used the peanutbutter I had on hand (Kraft Extra Creamy) so as I was about to add the brown sugar I stopped (I did drop a little in there though) thinking the peanut butter had enough sugar in it already. Next time I will leave out the brown sugar altogether. The red curry paste as called for did not add any heat so I added more halfway through. Next time I will actually at least double it from the beginning maybe even triple. There was a lot of chopping and it took some work but was well worth it.",
