It is now a must at every Thanksgiving and Christmas and is often requested with much anticipation by anyone who has had it. One recipe will serve 6, but barely. I promise there won't be leftovers. If you're going to feed 6 or more, I suggest doubling the recipe in a 9x13-inch pan.",

Luckily I had extra potatoes in the cabinet because one can did NOT cut it so I tripled he recipe and everything in it except the pineapple because I only had two cans.

Don't be scared... for whatever reason this was not too sweet... it was JUST PERFECT and it will be my go-to recipe for now on!",
