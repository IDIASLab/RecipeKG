The next evening, after allowing the roast to come up to room temperature, I put it in the pellet grill at 11:00 pm and let it smoke overnight at 150 degrees. At 8:00 am the next morning, I raised the grill temperature to 225 degrees and let it slow cook until it reached an internal temperature of 195 degrees, about eight hours. I then placed it in an unheated oven for an hour.  When I unwrapped it, the packaging was full of juice and the meat was fall-apart tender. We ate it straight on a plate, on a bun, with and without barbecue sauce. It was excellent, well worth the effort.",

I followed the recipe and instructions exactly except that I cooked the wrapped roast in a slow cooker instead of the oven, after reading Barbara Bodin\u2019s review indicating that she tried both ways and it came out the same. (Thanks, Barbara, for sharing this valuable tidbit!) The 14 hour calculated cook time for my 8 lb roast was just right for the slow cooker, which I set on high for the first 5 hours then reduced to the low setting for the remaining 9 hours. Be sure to wrap your roast so that the foil seal is on the fatty side, then place fatty, sealed side up in the slow cooker to keep most of the drippings inside the wrappings. A nice side benefit of wrapping is easy crockpot cleanup!",

I made the recipe exactly as printed except I used Hungarian paprika as we don't care for the McCormick brand I have of the smoked paprika.  No other changes - and yes - my oven did turn off after 12 hours.  I hadn't read about that, so I was unprepared.  It had been off for about an hour when I discovered it, so I had to adjust for an extra hour.  My roast was 8 1/2 pounds and it figured out to about 15 hours.  After it rested for an hour, we unwrapped it.  Oh my - what wonderful smells and sights.  The bone (smaller than I expected) slipped right out and I removed one small piece of fat and as I lifted the meat out, it just fell apart - no \"pulling\" needed.  We added some barbecue sauce, piled it on buns and topped it with slaw!   Hardly any chewing was required.  I've never had such a flavorful, tender pork shoulder roast.  We are planning DH birthday dinner in June and he requested that I make this again for that dinner.   No problem - I agree!!!",
