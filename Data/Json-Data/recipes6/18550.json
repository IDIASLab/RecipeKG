I believe the flavors tasted much better after they cooled and sat for about 10 minutes.  Great Recipe!",

I had only small peaches so for the two of us I used two whole peaches. One caveat - the recipe makes way too much glaze. I hate to waste Balsamic vinegar - next time I'll make half the amount of glaze. My husband and I really enjoyed the flavor. As another reviewer did I baked the peaches further after sprinkling on the bleu cheese. Kind of melds the flavors. I will definitely make this again for ourselves and for company. Will even try it with fresh pears as another reviewer suggested. Thanks for the recipe.",
