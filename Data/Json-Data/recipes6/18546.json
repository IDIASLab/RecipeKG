That's the beauty of allrecipe.com's Review/Rating Section; you get to share helpful ideas that can make a recipe shine. My changes, \r\n#1 Instead of using the chops whole, I sliced them into thin strips.You could also dice the meat. I dredged the pieces in seasoned flour and fried in hot peanut oil until golden brown.\r\n#2 I used brown sugar (big improvement)\r\n#3 I always use Kikoman Soy Sauce for its unique flavor. \r\n#4 I added a piece of fresh ginger and two cloves of garlic, diced. \r\n#5 I used a potato peeler and shredded a large carrot & added that near the end. \r\n#6 I added chicken broth to the fry pan and let it thicken, which it did beautifully. After scraping all of the tasty brown bits I returned the meat to the pan.\r\n#7 At the very end I threw in frozen brocolli. Don't get me wrong, Fireball provided a great recipe but my family found the additions made for a better dish. Another possibility is to add cayenne or hot sauce. This tasted exactly like Kung Pao Pork but without the peanuts which we don't like anyway. The added vegtables can include anything from greenbeans to bok choy to cauliflower. The sauce was a deep orange/brown and it I would be proud to serve it again.Thank you, fireball and allrecipes.com",

I substituted peanut oil for oil, and brown sugar for the white.  Also I cut back a bit on the soy sauce and increased the OJ accordingly.  I let it simmer gently until the pork was tender.  Served over oriental rice noodles with steamed broccoli.  Will make again and again.",

I dredged my thin chops in flour browned in olive oil and removed to a plate. Then in the oil in the pan I sauteed two minced garlic cloves and green onions (6) sliced on the diagonal. Used brown sugar instead of white. Before adding cornstarch mixture I shredded one whole carrot into sauce mixture. After thickening the sauce I added one 6-ounce can of mandarin oranges and returned pork to pan. Oh by the way I mixed cornstarch with the juice from mandarin orange can instead of water. I doubled the sauce ingredients except the soy sauce. Served over white rice and passed crushed red pepper at the table. This was awesome! Can't wait to try it with chicken!",
