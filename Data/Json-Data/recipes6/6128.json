It was hard to make it the right texture without adding too much powdered sugar so I think I would leave out one egg white next time! The recipe wasn't very clear on how to store the marzipan after coloring. I shaped mine into fruits and colored them but it never really got hard on the outside like the ones you buy in candy stores. I am still searching for the perfect recipe.",

I had to add almost a whole additional bag of powdered sugar but the results were heavenly. Perfect for shaping and coloring (I made fruit for a German competition). For my needs this recipe worked because i had an extra bag of powdered sugar on hand. This recipe is what you need if you're a newbie like me and have never made it before just add more powdered sugar until the consistency is to your liking.",
