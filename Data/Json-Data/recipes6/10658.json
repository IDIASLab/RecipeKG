I've also used this recipe with grated carrots instead of zucchini...and grated apples (using cinnamon instead of the ginger). Also I usually cook it in my ring pan. The last time I made it I used whole wheat pastry flour so it'd be lighter...added a glaze to the top and took it to a potluck...it was scarfed up!",
