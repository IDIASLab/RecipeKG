My chicken marinated for three hours but longer would be even more flavorful I'm sure. I thought the melted Swiss cheese was going to be weird on it but it worked. One thing I might try differently next time is slice the chicken so it will stay on the roll better. The cubes kept falling out or perhaps I will cut the cubes smaller. Do try the recipe and see what you think!",

The second time I made it I only had 3/4 a cup of ponzu sauce and that also worked okay. The recipe made way too much filling for the sandwiches for me though. I used 6 hoagie rolls and still had filling left over. The second time I used half a cabbage and it was still too much. On the bright side leftover filling makes an okay cabbage salad that can be served on its own.",

After cooking in marinade removed chicken added sweet chili sauce and reduced by 1/3. Ate it over rice with fried egg noodles. Also had it open-faced on a bolillo roll. Sprayed pan with non-stick spray added chicken on roll topped with swiss and heated until cheese justs melts. Plated topped with coleslaw mixed with mayo and sambal and drizzled thickened sauce on top. The crisp roll sweet & tangy chicken with the spicy mayo put it over the top. I did try marinating it overnight but the tang I adore from the ponzu sauce turned a bit sour. The finished product was still really good but I noticed it.",
