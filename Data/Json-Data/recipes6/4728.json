I didn't have raisins so I used currants and they worked very well. I suggest using a little less than 2 cups of broth. My quinoa was done and there was still quite a bit of liquid left which led to a bit of a mushy texture. The only change I would make is to use fresh cilantro. The 1/2 tsp of dried cilantro added no flavor. I loved the roasted red peppers mixed in and the crunch from the almonds. This quinoa would also be good served cold the next day.",

After the allotted time there was extra liquid as mentioned by another reviewer I left the pot on med-low with the lid off and evaporated the extra stirring a few times. Roasted my own peppers and a couple heads of garlic then squeezed a few cloves into the dish since we love garlic. The crunch of the nuts is necessary for some variation so if you don't prefers nuts maybe add something else with some crunch. Served cold this would be great with diced cucumber. I also thought it could be brightened up just a bit so we served with crumbled feta atop. Will definitely make this again and look forward to having cold leftovers.",

I also added a large sliced portabello mushroom to the onions in the beginning and you couldn't detect it later on. Its a great side dish and meal and I'm seriously considering adding it to the Thanksgiving table (the raisins remind me of stuffing for some reason!). I increased the seasonings slightly and I would add carrots next time. Thank you so much!",

Only change was to halve the recipe to 2 servings (these were generous, as a side could have been 3 to 4) add chopped mushrooms to saute,  used dried cranberries.  Ate a serving hot and felt like  the flavor was unremarkable, the cranberries and almond redeemed it and wished i had added more.  However, I couldn't put it down.  The next day I ate it cold, and wow.  The flavors had melded with just a touch of sweetness.  While eating quinoa left me picking birdseed from my teeth, the flavors in this dish served cold are  worth it.  Going on my summer meal rotation",
