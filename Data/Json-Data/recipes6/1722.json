I had to substitute pine nuts instead of sunflower seed kernels and I didn't have any flaxseeds and I used a healthy granola mix kind of cereal instead of granola but I am very happy with the result.  It might rate a five star if I had all of the proper ingredients.  I gave it four stars because it was a little soft and sticky but I think that was because of my substitutions.  The flavor is incredible and although soft they held together pretty well.",
