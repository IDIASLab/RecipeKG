None that I baked came out like hers until I tried this recipe. It really tastes like the authentic quality of melting in your mouth heaven and a not too sweet experience. They are a \"Wow!\" To give the cookies a more melt in your mouth quality, I substituted Crisco for the butter. I used the same amount that the recipe calls for. The Crisco needs to be heated and melted then cooled in order to take these cookies up one more notch towards perfection. The next variation that I added is actual lemon zest, in both the cookie and the icing. It then creates a cookie that is truly at the peak of gourmet perfection. I share this recipe with others, and I bake these cookies for so many holiday gifts for family, friends and loved ones. It's the one the people start asking for weeks and weeks before the holidays get into swing. They say, \"I hope you're gonna bring us those lemon cookies again this year!!! What more can I say. Just make them.",

These are very Italian cookies not overly sweet with a subtle eggy flavor set off by the tart lemon icing. The outside is sturdy and the inside tender and rather dry. The frosting dries like a fondant - hard glossy and stackable. This cookie will appeal to adults more than to children. It's great with coffee and better the second day than it is fresh. These will ship well. The recipe as printed makes plenty of extra frosting possibly enough for a second batch of cookies. Next time I'll use more lemon juice and less water in the frosting.",
