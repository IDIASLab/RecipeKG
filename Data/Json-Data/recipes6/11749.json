I also make sure to use Apple CIDER not Apple juice. Apple Cider gives it a richer flavor and it holds up when heated better. Love the way my home smells when I make this during the holidays. Don't forget to try it with your favorite rum or brandy for a nice night cap.:)",

I toss in a few whole green cardamom pods with the other spices. (Sorry for being inexact - the number depends on the amount of Wassail and the size and freshness of the pods... and personal taste. Try 1 or 2 if you are not accustomed to the flavor of cardamom.) DO use real oranges and lemons (not juice concentrates) - the fresh juices make all the difference in the world. Worth the work of all of that squeezing:-)",
