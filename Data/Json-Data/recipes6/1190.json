For the frosting I used fresh squeezed OJ from the orange that I zested. Again following the recipe exactly. It had a nice flavor but I personally did not care for the pumpkin/orange flavor combo. These would have been much better with a plain butter cream or a cream cheese frosting. This recipe was also poorly received by my family. I will not be making this again.",
