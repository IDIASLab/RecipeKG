This recipe includes way too much fat to be necessary...the butter is overboard and fat free cheese is okay...I also added corn niblets.  I made this for the Fourth of July but ended up having to make another batch from BETTER HOMES & GARDENS COOKBOOK (excellent moist and firm recipe by the way!) the morning of the BBQ. this was a huge, disappointment.
