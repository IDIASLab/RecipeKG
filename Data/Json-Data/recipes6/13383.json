Another tip for those whose meringue seems to slip off lemon pies is to make sure you place the meringue on top of the lemon filling while it ( the lemon ) is still hot. It slightly cooks the bottom of the meringue thus adhering it to the pie. Also make sure to spread the meringue all the way to the edges sealing them.",

It is RAINING here today in Cincinnati and we all know what luck one can have making meringue when it rains. Well guess what? It is perfect! The stiff peaks formed beautifully and stayed that way! I made this for a lemon meringue pie and it did not shrink away from the sides..stays right where you put it. It might be my oven but it seems to need longer than 15 minutes at 375 to get a nice lightly tanned top but it is definitely a keeper! This is what I will use for my meringue pies from now on!!! thanks for a super no fail recipe.",
