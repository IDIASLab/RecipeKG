My little guy suggested trying this with chicken wings so I can't wait to try it like that. I did remove the skin from the chicken thighs just to make it a bit healthier and that worked wonderfully. It took about 45 mins. total for the chicken to be done. Hubby wants me to make a jar of the sauce for him to take to work lol that's how much he loved it! The recipe didn't specify what to do with the limes and cilantro so I just assumed to put them on before serving. I also drizzled mine w/ a bit of honey to cut the heat a bit (I like spicy but not too spicy)...it was delicious w/ that addition. This is a definite keeper YUM YUM YUM!!!!!!!!

I didn't have time to let it marinate for so long so I put the chicken thighs in a baking dish poured all the sauce in let it marinate for 1/2 an hour & followed the same baking time as the recipe and just let it bake in the sauce. Turned out great. I will definitely make it again.",
