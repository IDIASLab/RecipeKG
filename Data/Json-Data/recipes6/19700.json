Next time I will use the slow cooker after browning the meat and sauteeing the onions garlic and mushrooms. It also took longer than 30 minutes to fully cook the carrots I would put them in the last 45 minutes to an hour of cooking. I will definitely make this again. We like venison and I'm always looking for different ways to make it since we have a freezer full after hunting season! This one definitely made the cut.",

My husband raved...\"Now this is a German meal!\" I have made this dish with pork. I have added Chanterelles and Morels. This recipe is a keeper. The more woodsy you can make it only enhances the flavors. Ruth Ward bless her came up with a real winner! I make home made spaetzle with this and I cook down 3 big onions in Ganse Schmaltz. They are the garnish for the spaetzle. I also buy a jar of Lingonberry preserves to set on the plate for a touch of sweet and sour. A really great meal!",

I first cooked some bacon in a cast iron skillet to get some of the drippings then later chopped up 3 slices to add to the mix. Once I browned the vension I added that to my slowcooker. Poured off the skillet before sauting the onion mushrooms & garlic. I put the entire 16 oz. of baby carrots in the cooker while I brought the wine a cognac to a simmer. I added everyting to the slow cooker and cooked on low for 4 hours. Turned out great! I did not use the cornstarch as we like a more broth-like stew so we can sop it up with bread!",

I think for other reviewers who said their meat came out dry using the wrong cut of meat could have been to blame maybe? The only change I made was using 2 beef bouillon cubes instead of one because I felt it needed a little salt...don't ask me why I don't like salty but it needed a little more. I also thickened my sauce at the end. My kids and hubby all loved it. They thought it was beef instead of venison. This will be a staple venison recipe in our house.
