First, use HALF of a 12oz can of lemonade concentrate (not pink) in the batter, plus the extra flour mentioned below and lowering to 350.  The bottoms will brown but the tops never get really brown.  It is a soft  cakey cookie when done.  I then iced them with a butter/confectioners sugar/milk icing that I added the other half of the lemonade concentrate to.  I also added a touch of red to make the icing pink.  I'd seen these cookies done this way and then called pink lemonade cookies at an awesome bakery. I made the icing kind of thick... Mine tasted identical...everyone loved them and there eyes rolled back as they chewed.  I also added a tiny dust of red sugar sprinkles just to make them pretty.  Try it, you wont be disappointed.",

These are the changes I made and they made these exactly the cookie I was craving... hope it works for you as well. \nNEW AND IMPROVED LEMONADE ZINGER COOKIES\n1 1/4 C Butter\n1 C white sugar\n3 1/2 C self-rising flour\n1 can frozen lemonade concentrate\n2 C powdered sugar\nlemon zest for garnish\n\nCream 1 C butter and 1 C white sugar.  Gradually beat in self-rising flour.  Add 3/4 C concentrate.  Drop rounded teaspoonfuls onto a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 13-15 minutes or until tops look dry and bottom edges are just barely beginning to brown.  Let cool completely before removing from cookie sheet.  For frosting, beat 2 C powdered sugar, 1/6 C of concentrate (I just filled my 1/3 C measure half full) and 1/4 C butter.  Decorate as desired.  Garnish with lemon zest.  BEWARE, these are potent but yummy.  Took them to a cookie exchange and they got rave reviews because they were so different from the rest.  Hope these changes work great for you!",

If I'd have baked them any longer they would have burned so I'm not exactly sure why they turned out like that. I've stored the leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge so maybe that'll help them firm up a bit. I will try this recipe one more time though because they didn't taste bad. My issue was with the texture. I'm just wondering if maybe I did something wrong and that's why they turned out so soft and literally fell apart.",
