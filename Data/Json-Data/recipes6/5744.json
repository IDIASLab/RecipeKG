If a recipe touts itself as a \"crock pot\" recipe (as this does in the tag line/footnote), I don't want to brown, sautee, or sear, that defeats the purpose of the crockpot in my world.  So, rather than follow the directions and essentially cook the soup before using the crock pot to keep it warm/allow the flavors to meld, I tossed it all in the crock pot (sans celery) and left it on low while we were at work.  We came home to a delicious dinner.  The appearance was a tad off due to my lazy method (you could a see a bit of the butter pooling, but a quick stir took care of it), but it was tasy, nonetheless.  I was a bit concerned the half and half would curdle, but it didn't (I used fat free, not sure if that made a difference or not).  The only reason for 4 stars is it needs a lot of salt.  I know it says \"to taste\", but I used at least a T or more to give it some flavor (and even MR. LTH, who doesn't generally use salt, added more at service).  I think I'd prefer a seasoned salt of some sort next time.  THANKS for the recipe!",

Delicious.\n\nAs for the seasoning/salt issue, rotisserie chicken tends to be much saltier than raw or home prepared, so perhaps that is where others were surprised by the need to add more salt. if you don't saut\u00e9 the veggies too, it will reduce flavor A LOT.",

I did cut the recipe in half because it is only my husband and myself at home. We liked it very much especially the tip about adding the vegetable to the rou\u00e9. I will do that more often in the future. It was very good but could have used a little more flavor so you don't need to add so much salt & pepper. I'd hate to add an herb like rosemary or cumin because it would change the flavor too much. We did have leftovers and I added a little more salt & pepper a little poultry seasoning and 3 strips of crumbled bacon as others suggested. This enhanced the flavor without really changing the original taste. For all those who left out the carrots and celery I would like to offer a tip. Diced them until they are teeny-tiny. My husband always pulls the carrots out of stew soup or chicken pies but he doesn't even notice them when I do this and I get to add those flavors. I am sure I will make this again.
