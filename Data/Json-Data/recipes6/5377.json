This vegan mushroom stuffing immediately became a family (and friends) favorite. You can eliminate the mushrooms if you don't like them. You can make the homemade croutons days before and store them in zip-top bags or plastic containers, which makes the stuffing a whole lot easier. Try it for Thanksgiving!",
