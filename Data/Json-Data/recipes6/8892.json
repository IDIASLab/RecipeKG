I would point out that if you are using table salt to cut the amount of salt in 1/2. \r\n\r\nMany users also ask if this is good on other cuts of meat, I use it on all cuts of meat (beef and pork) especially roast. For poultry, I might suggest replacing the oregano with sage.",

I have tried many times before to make a tip roast with them all ending up to be tough and dry.  Your recipe produced comments by all, that it tasted just like prime rib!  It was tender and juicy and flavorful.   It turned out excellent!  The recipe is called herb, but it is more on the spicy side...not overwhelming though.   I did follow the recipe to a T...however I put the spice rub on and let the meat come to room tempature before baking.  After an hour of cooking, I checked the meat for internal tempature of 140 degrees (rare) and when it reached that temperature, I turned off the oven and allowed it to sit another 15 to 30 minutes in the oven to produce medium rare.  Came out excellent!!  Thank you very much for sharing this excellent recipe!",

I had a 5 pound roast so I dropped the temp to 325 and cooked it for about an hour.  (Until the temp reached 135), then I rested it while I made the gravy and mashed the potatoes.  This roast produced one of the best gravies I've ever made.  I cooked it on a rack in a shallow baking pan and put a can of beef broth and a couple of bay leaves underneath it.  While the beef rested I strained the broth into a butter roux.  (The broth had concentrated and it was a little salty so I added about 1/2 cup of water.)  The resulting gravy was delicious.  I'll definitely use this rub again.  Thanks for a great recipe!",
