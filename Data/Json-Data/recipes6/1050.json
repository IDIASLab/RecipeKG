I have made hundreds of things off of this site and this is the first review I have ever done But it deserves one. I just follow the recipe whenever I can but use what ever jam I have on hand. (raspberries generally dont grow well here so whatever I have preserved I use). I have even made these with coconut oil and left out the coconut flakes and that is wonderful as well. These are called something else but another reason I use this one instead is I like the name. lol try them you will love them! add more of these great little funny named things I will eat them and let you know!",
