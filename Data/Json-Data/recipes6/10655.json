Maybe I didn't drain the spinach well enough because it was quite green - or maybe I put too much wanting it to be 1/2 cup after it was thawed drained & squeezed. It worked well for the occasion though! I also made a few changes - I substituted half bread flour half whole wheat flour a light cheese blend from Trader Joe's and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I added 3 cloves of garlic and half a teaspoon each of Basil Thyme & rosemary. Everybody loved the bread with the fondue and it even tastes amazing by itself!",

Regardless I drained it then squeezed it so it was somewhat drained. I also added garlic to the bread and my bread was a bit stickier than I think it was supposed to be but it still pulled away from the pan so it was good. I only made the dough in the breadmaker; I'm a diehard oven baking fan. I was going to let it rise for about 30 minutes; but it just was so quick to rise I abandoned that effort after about 15 minutes. I really didn't want it to become a monster loaf. I baked the bread at 375 for about 45 minutes; not sure it normally needs so long but again my dough was sticky. It turned out with a crunchy crust but still a soft bread. Great for sandwiches and even just with a piece of cheese it's great. Thanks for the recipe!",
