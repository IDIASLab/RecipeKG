I mean to try to describe this using just one word may be virtually impossible just as impossible as it is to eat just one slice- yes it's that good. If you're a self proclaimed chocoholic have ever been accused of being one or if you're addicted to peanut butter like me then this is the dessert for you! What an awesome combination of flavors and textures! And what's great about this is for as gorgeous as this turns out it's surprisingly easy to make! I used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer which really helped. I followed the recipe exactly and kept thinking \"No way can something this easy to make be this good?\". It's really hard not to \"sample\" at each step from the crust to the filling to the toppings. I did try to lighten it up a bit by using reduced fat Oreos reduced fat cream cheese reduced fat peanut butter and light Cool Whip so I didn't feel too \"guilty\" about enjoying this dessert. I highly recommend rinsing/wiping down your knife between each slice when cutting into this pie. I think you could even make this into some really awesome parfaits and refrigerate instead of freezing. This most certainly is one heck of a \"Sweet Creation\" and makes you look like a hero in front of friends and family! Thanks MySweetCreations for a great recipe - one I'll be making often!",

I top mine with whipped cream caramel and chocolate sauce and Reese's Cups. Sometimes I add an extra sprinkle of cinnamon on top of mine. I sometimes like to serve with an extra dollop of whipped cream on the side. You can add the toppings before freezing. This recipe is easily adjustable you can use low-fat cream cheese or even make homemade whipped cream to sub for store bought which is something I often do myself. Be sure to check out my \"What's Cooking?\" episode on AllRecipes as I make this recipe in the episode. You can find it by clicking on the \"Video\" tab towards the top of this page and searching for MySweetCreations\" San Diego in under the \"What's Cooking?\" episodes. I hope that helps!",

This was very rich and delicious! All of my children absolutely loved it. The oldest said it beats anything he has ever tasted before hands down! The cheesecake part of the dessert was very smooth creamy and tasty. The two sauces add a nice touch but next time for our preference a little more chocolate and less caramel! I chose to freeze the cheescake first then decorated the cheesecake by drizzling some of the sauces on top and then arranging the the chopped peanut butter cups over that. Served the whipping cream on the side in case some did not want whipping cream. Very pretty presentation and is definitely a new favorite dessert for this family. Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe!!!",
