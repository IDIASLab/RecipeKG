I have made a few changes though it still comes out incredibly rich. They are: 1) I omit tossing the bread cubes with melted butter--this much additional fat is unnecessary. Just toss the bread cubes with the powdered mixture and sprinkle what doesn't adhere evenly over the cubes in the baking dish. Then I sprinkle chips over bread--I've used both choc and white choc but not cinnamon. 2) I substitute evaporated skim milk for the cream. 3) I've never made the drizzle--though I'm sure it makes it look nice it is unnecessary. After I made this once I was lookin' for opporunities to \"bring dessert\". We couldn't get enough of it. It's even better with a scoop of ice cream or a ladle of creme anglaise.",

This recipe is also very good made with Hershey's Butterscotch Chips or Peanut Butter Chips (even richer). The Cinnamon Chips are not available in all grocery stores and can be hard to find. This dessert is great right out of the oven and reheats well also. I highly reccomend this! P.S. As with any baking..make sure your eggs haven't expired or this could turn out a little runny.",
