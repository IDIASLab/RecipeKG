Unacceptable!\n\nI would have been mortified had I served this to company!!\n\nI think the steps need to be amended as follows:  CREAM butter and sugar, ADD eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition, MIX in mashed banana, MIX in DRY ingredients to WET in three batches, scraping down after each, STIR in nuts.  It makes no sense and serves no purpose that I can see to *stir* in banana, eggs or dry ingredients.  They need *mixing* to be thoroughly incorporated.\n\nI added 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp cinnamon. Used dark brown sugar/white in a 3:1 ratio.  Pecans instead of walnuts.\n\nHave not tasted anything this great in a LOOOONG time!  The crust is fabulous, banana flavor is great, moisture is awesome!  And I read it will be better tomorrow!! \n\nAmazing.",

Like others, I added 1/2 tsp baking powder, used half white and half dark brown sugar, and used pecans instead of walnuts. This is JUST LIKE MOMS! Thank you so much! I had tried two other recipes from this website and they turned out to be more like banana nut dessert cake, THIS is banana nut bread, it has substance! I used 3x8 loaf pans (it filled them just right), reduced the temp to 325, and cooked for about 70 minutes. They were a little too brown on the top, but that's just my bad electric oven, the humidity, and the combo of unbleached flour and dark brown sugar most likely. Mom would be proud of this bread! If you want something healthy to snack on, eat a luna bar, if you want something tasty, eat this bread! PS: If anyone wants to save a bowl and skip a step, I just mixed the wet mix as directed, then dumped the salt, baking soda, baking powder, and flour on top and mixed it all in at once. It turned out FINE.",

You can taste the butter in this bread along with the bananas--it practically melts in your mouth! My house smelled so YUMMY as the loaves baked. My family and I went through both loaves in just two days. Caution! It is highly addicting and hard to stay away from! The only changes I made to this recipe were #1. I added 2 tsp. vanilla #2. I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts & #3. I baked for 55 minutes instead of 60-70 minutes (this would have overcooked/burned the loaves)I have a 4 year old oven that bakes evenly/accurately. I would check the loaves of bread at 55 minutes before allowing them to cook any longer. This recipe easily earns 5 stars! My kids & hubby can't wait for the bananas to over-ripen! It would be hard to flub this recipe!",

Used 1 tsp. each vanilla and allspice and had just barely 2 cups of bananas (4 whole bananas)I mixed the butter sugar mixture really smooth and added 1/2 the bananas to that as well so some were chunkier and some smooth and i also whipped the 4 eggs with the beater to get them fluffy.  Made one with walnuts and one without for picky family members. just by the smell and picking off part of the top i already knew it was going to be a hit! I was concerned with the amount of sugar but looks like i had nothing to worry about because it's fantastic!! Mine took exactly 1 hour and could have used about 55 minutes.",

I have never in my life had better banana nut bread!I used Smart Balance instead of the butter, and I included the 1 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of cinn. and 1 tsp of vanilla as recommended by others. I made it in two loaf pans and it was done in 45 minutes. It is incredibly moist and not at all dense... very light. Perfect in every sense!Everybody who has had a slice immediately goes mmmmmmmmm...I had to force myself to stop eating it long enough to write this review!",
