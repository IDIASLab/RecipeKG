I have since modified the recipe slightly by adding an extra egg yolk for a richer color and 25g of icing sugar to the pastry and have used rock sugar instead for the jam for a shiny finishing and taste.  On the whole, this is really a fantastic recipe - all my friends and family really love these melt in mouth little tarts which I made during the Chinese Lunar New Year.  Thanks Diana!",

I added an extra yolk to the dough and about 1/8 cup of confectioners sugar as suggested by another reviewer. Not too much of a difference to me. I did however reduce the temp to 350 degrees which helped. The first batch was a little too brown at 400 in my oven. Leaving the dough in the fridge overnight makes it easier to work with. Just for informations sake 1 fresh Dole pineapple is perfect for the ingredients stated for the dough.",

Making the Tart Crust fresh wasn't too hard (but you must refrigerate the Dough overnight to get the best consistency to easily roll it out and to cut it). The Directions on how to make the Tart shape is too confusing and thankfully I know how to make them already. A 2\" Flat Cookie Base spread the Pineapple Filling Inside and then layer a 1 1/2\" Dough Ring on the top.",
