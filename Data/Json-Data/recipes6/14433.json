Here's the thing. The flavor of this is great BUT there is way too much filling for so little crust. I mixed up the cheesecake part in my Kitchen Aid and I could just tell it was going to be too much for one 8 or 9 inch pie pan. I pressed the crumbs into a 8x8 glass baking pan, baked the crust at 350* for 8 minutes, then just followed the rest of the recipe. I really liked this recipe but it really should be double the crust ingredients and make two pies out of it.",

I made a gingersnap crumb crust rather than the crust in the recipe, and added another half package of cream cheese to the filling.  I may try using two full packages the next time I make it.  Unlike a cheesecake, you don't really taste the cream cheese, but I'm sure that's what makes this pie a cut above the traditional pumpkin pie.  It was absolutely delicious, and everyone was disappointed when it was gone.  I found it took a few extra minutes to bake.  The center was still a bit wobbly when I removed the pie from the oven, but firmed up after it had cooled.\r\n\r\n",

I used store bought crust for the bottom BUT I still mixed up walnuts (cheaper) sugar and ginger in the KitchenAid and set aside. I mixed up the filling as directed but whipped it well after the spices went in so it fluffed up. Although it didn't \"look\" fluffy it was. I also got two pies that fit nicely into the tins you get from Marie Calendars. After filling half way I spread the nut/sugar/ginger mixture over both pies. I sprinkled it on and then kind of lightly packed it in/on. I filled up the remaining mixture on top and then decorated the top with pecans before baking. I also cut the crusts and made a pie edge. Still baking so we'll see how it goes.",
