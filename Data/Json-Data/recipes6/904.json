I cut the baking soda & powder by just a tad and my pancakes were very very fluffy. I had to smoosh them down a bit. I did have to add a bit more milk which I hate to do since it makes you mix them more. But the flavor was very very good! I used White Whole Wheat and less vanilla (personal preference I'm not a huge fan of vanilla in pancakes). I used a bit less brown sugar. I just used Pam instead of oil in the pan.

I used white whole wheat flour and vegetable oil in place of applesauce. The batter was extremely thick and more consistent with a muffin batter. For me an ideal pancake batter should be thick yet pourable. I added more milk until I got the consistency I wanted. Following the recipe directions I used 2 Tablespoons of batter per pancake. I got 24 cute little medallion sized pancakes. Hardly big enough for a single serving as suggested by the recipe but they say times were hard during WW II. People had to ration back then and maybe that was all you got. I don t know? I just know these little gems were light fluffy and flavorful. The only thing you have to be careful with is not to overcook them or they get dry and crumbly.",

The pancakes themselves were pretty filling we ate them for dinner and I could only have two pancakes using a 1/4 cup measuring scoop to pour and my husband had 5. I took Sarah Jo's suggestion of adding more baking powder I added an additional 1/2 tsp of both baking powder and baking soda and they were super thick and fluffy. If you don't like thick I would advise against increasing the raising agents that much. It was a bit on the sweet side and I would probably reduce the sugar to 1/3 or 1/4 cup next time. I put in strawberries but it was too sweet with all the sugar to put in the chocolate chips I normally throw into pancakes or even to serve with syrup.",

My kids loved them and so did I! I decided to take some reviewers suggestions. I added an additional 1/2 tsp of baking powder and cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup. The pancakes rose well and had a wonderful sweetness to them. If I had had applesauce I would have used it as suggested but I didn't so I added 3 tablespoons plain greek yogurt and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil. I just couldn't stand the thought of pouring 1/2 cup of oil into my pancakes. They turned out wonderful. I think I'll add 2 tsp cinnamon next time when I make these again with the applesauce.
