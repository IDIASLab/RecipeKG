I halved the recipe and made it in an 8x8 pan. I was a little worried while making these because the topping was watery difficult to spread over the chocolate and it didn't seem like there'd be enough to cover the whole thing. But it baked up nice with a few peaks of chocolate here and there. I also added a pinch of sugar to the topping as my coconut was unsweetened. Oh and I used dark chocolate chips and I would definitely recommend using them! Thanks for the recipe! (Also the chocolate does harden once they are cool. I wouldn't keep them in the fridge or you might lose a tooth! I'm wondering if adding a little cream to the chocolate would keep it a little softer? Still delicious though!)",

The crust is very very thin and almost like damp sand when placed in the pan. (and I even sift my flour always). I would suggest if you are making these to melt the chocolate first and then spread instead of that extra minute in the oven. The crust was a very dark brown by the time they were done and tasted like pie crust. I would also suggest you not use unsweetened coconut. the topping barely covered the top and was too chewy. I've gone over this recipe to make sure I didn't mis-measure but the topping was very dry the chocolate hardens and the crust is very thin and not sweet at all.",
