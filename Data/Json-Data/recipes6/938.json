Don't skip the maple.....it adds something delicious to this dish! A little food psychology.....my family doubted that this was the whole dinner and not just the vegetable! I told them it was a casserole baked in a vegetable instead of a dish. I plated it with my lettuce salad on the plate to make the plate look full. Everyone was happy! The second time I made it I substituted brown rice for the wild rice and used dried cherries for the craisins. Less fall like but we thought this rated 5 stars too.",
