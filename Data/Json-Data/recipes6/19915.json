I also didn't have shallots so I used vidalia onion with a touch of garlic minced together and that worked out fine. Didn't have unsalted so I used salted butter. There is a lot of sauce and I though about cutting back on those ingredients next time but it coats the carrots well this way. All those little chunks soaking up that heavenly sauce. In any case no complaints I will be making this alot! Oh yeah.. This says it serves 6. I think that's being conservative realistically it's more like 4 servings.
