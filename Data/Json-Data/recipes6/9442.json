This time I think I've nailed it:  I add about 3T of mayo to increase the creamy consistency, substitute sweet onion for green, reduce worcestershire to about 1/2t and increase soy to about 1t. I also add 1/2t of lemon juice, 2T of grated parmesan, and 1/2t of white sugar.  I grease a muffin pan and add the mixture to the center of the wonton wrapper.  I then fold up all four corners to the center and pinch off, then place in the muffin tins and bake as directed.  It looks a little different, as you can see the filling inside of the openings of the wonton \"cups\", but that means it can hold more dipping sauce (sweet & sour)!   I suppose with all these changes I should just submit a new recipe, but so far this has been the best base for crab rangoon.",

So, I added an extra package and a half of cream cheese, a few tablespoons lemon juice, and a couple spoonfuls of sugar. And it was EXCELLENT. So I'm giving it 4 stars because while it's good, it's not GREAT... Everyone has different taste preferences though, I just prefer it to be sweeter rather than fishy.",
