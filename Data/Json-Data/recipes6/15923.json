I dbl'd the spices and added a Greek-Allspice. I ended up with a big, delicious, pot of Lentil's and veggi's.  Wonderful, healthy, and low in fat.  Cant go wrong with that!!!!",

It's easy to make, low-fat and low-calorie, and so yummy you forget it's good for you.  Definately a staple to keep on hand for munching.",

I did not precook the lentils as suggested - altho to take out some of the starch I rinsed & drained the lentils. I followed the amount of ingredients suggested by the tool except for these items: 1 1/2 c green lentils & 1/2 c red lentils, 3 stalks celery, 1 large onion, 4 c chicken broth & 6 cup veg. broth, many more cloves garlic 1/2 crushed 1/2 chopped, finally 1 tsp  hot curry powder.\nWe wanted this to be a soup as opposed to a stew so the increase of the liquid did this. The inrease in garlic and curry powder is to satisfy our personal tastes (was not too hot, but seemed to pull everything together). With a little tweaking to each persons taste,I believe that this Soup can become a mainstay for everyone.",
