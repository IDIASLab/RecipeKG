It will be soft. DO NOT PRE BAKE THE CRUST. Double the ingredients for the filling. Pour it into the crust and bake it for 45 minutes at the 350 temp. This is so ooey gooey good. ",

Since the filling completely covers the crust I bake the crust about 15 minutes first. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used sliced almonds instead of pecans. Lastly I subtracted about 10 minutes from bake time. So easy and so delicious! You won't be disappointed.",

I used a combination of milk and semisweet chocolate chips in the filling. At 40 minutes I thought it was way too gooey but I didn't want to bake over the suggested time so I took it out against my better judgment. I didn't enjoy it at first but by the next morning it had firmed up while still maintaining just the right amount of gooeyness. I microwave a sliver for 15 seconds and serve it with a scoop of ice cream--it's heavenly!",

I also did not have any coconut on hand so left it out and threw in a few crushed walnuts... it was great with those changes too!  I served it right out of the oven and it was way too hot, so let it cool slightly before serving.  I didn't have any ice cream nor whipping cream when I first served it and it does need one or the other!  i liked it cold the next day as well... great recipe, Thanks!",

It is very rich and a thin slice will go far.  We thought it goes best with a cold, tall glass of milk.  Definitely will make this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.",
