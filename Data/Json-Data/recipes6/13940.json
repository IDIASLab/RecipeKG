I think the key is to start with a good base - I used family style italian from that handsome blue-eyed actor. The sugar took the edge off the acidic tartness you can get from the vinegar. The fresh garlic brightened up the flavor. If I am in a pinch and don't have time to make a homeade dressing - this will do the trick.",
