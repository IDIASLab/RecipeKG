Everyone else who's reviewed it commented on the moistness so I tried again. The second time I doubled the recipe but used three eggs instead of two and substituted brown sugar for half the white sugar. I also used dried cranberries rather than raisins or currants. This batch is moist and yummmmy! I also realized that with my first batch I was using unbleached 'artisan bread' flour rather than regular all-purpose flour which I'd purchased thinking it was regular unbleached flour. Don't know what the difference is but I switched to good old gold medal and this batch came out great!",

I added 1/2 cup of applesause along with the oil and it is just perfect. With or without the changes this bread is excellent!",

I mixed 1/2-cup Splenda and 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4-cup wheat flour with 3/4 cup white flour. The results were good but still not as awesome as the original. I will make the lightened version for my household but when it comes to giving it away I will stick to the original. PS: Unbelievable but true - I recently tried to double this recipe but I accidently only added 2 cups of flour instead of 3 cups. The result was more like a zucchini cake. So I went to the store and bought some cream cheese frosting and everyone raved about it! They are still saying I make the best zucchini bread out of our whole big Italian family!",
