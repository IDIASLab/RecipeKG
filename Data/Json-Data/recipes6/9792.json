The one thing I will mention is that my zucchini did not get real cooked. It was pretty crunchy. That is how we like it but I thought I'd mention that . If you like it really soft I recommend pre-cooking it a bit prior to stuffing. You don't want to just add to the cooking time or your sausage will get dried out.",
