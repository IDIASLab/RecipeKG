I tried to balance with vinegar and then worcestershire sauce after the fact. It mostly worked. \nI only had a green pepper so used carrots & celery, diced very small, which worked well. I didn't add corn because it was already to sweet. Also used whole wheat penne which nobody complained about. So, all in all a solid kid-friendly meal, but tweak the recipe if you don't like your dinner too sweet.",
