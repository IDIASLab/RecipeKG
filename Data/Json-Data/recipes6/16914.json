I added 1-2 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp vanilla. To get a smooth flavor more like fruity ice cream place the pre-canned milk mix in your freezer in a tubbaware bowl and stir it about every 45 minutes. When it seems a bit more firm (about 2 hrs) add the canned milk (only 4-5oz!) and let set overnight. Break it up in the morning and mix in a blender or stand mixer till smooth (the more air you get into the mix the lighter the end product will be) Then place back in the freezer to firm up again. Note: You can use strained watermelon mango grapes or any fruit or mix to create your own favorites with this recipe.",

While I had the original orange part out of the freezer beating it I took a taste of that and it was pretty good so I had high hopes. I was disappointed with how the evaporated milk changed it so much. I will try experimenting and see if I can work this into something more orangy and less creamy. It was pretty easy and I love orange so there's at least a good basis here. UPDATE: A long time later and I decided to do something with this. I didn't want to get too drastic at first so I increased the orange juice to 1 cup and then added 1 T of concentrate to give it more orange flavor. I had 3 oz. evaporated milk left over from something else so I just tried the 3 oz. It was definitely much better and closer to sherbet. But it could still use a bit more orange. There's still something off about the consistency and I'm not sure how to fix that. With these changes I might call this a 4. (However the recipe is still a 2.)",
