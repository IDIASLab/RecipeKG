Also, the use of a lid is somewhat important if you notice that all of your pan juices are starting to cook away..I used my lid for about five minutes in the middle of the 15 minutes (I live at high altitude so it takes longer to cook carrots here) and then reduced the spice concoction at the end. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil..I almost always stay true to the original version but I was out of vegetable oil.  Either way it was *Excellent*!!!...We used more cayenne pepper but we like it hot here in New Mexico!!  Yummy!!!",

Used couple tablespoons of evoo and 1/2 stick of butter. Added brown sugar and spices after about five minutes of sweating carrots on upper range of medium heat. Then reduced heat to med-low to finish cooking. As liquid began thickening a little too much I added a couple tablespoons of water. Delicious. Might have been heavy on brown sugar but not focused on healthy just flavor.",

I prepared everything as directed but I used peeled baby carrots instead of the sliced. I reduced the heat to low after about 5 minutes. I used a lid the entire time. Towards the end the sauce got a bit sticky and thick I will try adding a small amount of water if it happens again as another reviewer suggested. This recipe went over well in my house and a few of us that prefer raw carrots actually ate them and thought they were good - and would eat them again! I was happy to see evoo works as well.
