Then I read the ingredients and the reviews and they all mentioned chocolate candies. Well, I already had the Smarties and the contributor seemed to describe the actual Smarties candy \u201ctart and crunchy\u201d. I only used 1 cup of candy and that seemed perfect.  They melted into the dough and the tart sweetness was a nice combination. I suggest using the Smarties otherwise it is just another chocolate chip cookie. The Smarties make it an experience like no other!",

When I saw this recipe used candy-coated chocolate I knew I wanted to try it as I had some Almond Joy pieces I also wanted to use. It was a perfect match. It was very easy to make but it didn't tell you how to prepare the cookie sheet. (Perhaps Allrecipes can fix that for you) I used parchment paper and it worked very well. Thank you PAYDRA for sharing your recipe!",
