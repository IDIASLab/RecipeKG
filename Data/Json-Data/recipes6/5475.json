However this is more of a beef casserole with lasagne noodles than a lasagne. There's no ricotta cheese so ditch the side dishes you'd use with a regular lasagne. I put aluminum foil over the top to keep the top layer from getting dry and poured some extra tomato sauce on it. Not dry at all. The layer of cheese on top is a great touch.",
