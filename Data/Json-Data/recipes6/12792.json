After it cooled, I made a frosting of peanut butter, powdered sugar, a little milk and a little butter. I spread that on top, then drizzled with more melted chocolate chips. The result was heaven! \nThis recipe made a great base, but with the frosting and melted chocolate it was awesome.",

They came out chewy, like a brownie but a little denser, and extremely peanutty.\n\nI think the texture might be affected by what kind of peanut butter you use. I used old-fashioned creamy, the kind you stir. They would probably come out different with shelf-stable peanut butter, maybe more dry.\n\nThe chocolate chip \"frosting\" is a good idea--it was super-easy and adds a great touch. I used a fancier kind of chips (extra-dark chocolate, these are for a gift) and they taste just fabulous. My husband is already bugging me to make us our own batch!\n\nBut I'm not going to, because the only down side with these is the total calories. Yikes! Special occasions only.",
