First it calls for a NOT stirring it which makes absolutely no sense to me although we did not stir it and it melted just fine. It also calls for a bunch of white sugar and barely any brown sugar so it comes out looking like a bunch of cooked grease. Ours did not set up we followed directions exactly and ended up with a huge sticky mess to dump out. Guess I am going back to my old recipe for caramels....at least I know it works!",

I only use it to coat granny smith apples before coating them in chocolate. I left out the additional cup of sweetened condensed milk. I stirred until it was at soft ball stage then coated the apples. This doesn't get break-a-tooth hard when you refridgerate it and was perfect. A tip for cleaning: run HOT water over the pan it'll gradually melt the caramel away. Cold water just makes it that much harder to get clean.",
