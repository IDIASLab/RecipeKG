After adding the strawberry-sugar mixture I literally had to just drop the rest of the batter on the top. The cake itself is more biscuit-y rather than cake-y and even though it had both baking powder and baking soda it didn't rise much. It appeared to be a little dry coming out of the oven so I added a glaze on the top. I followed the recipe to the letter but ended up with a pretty small cake that wouldn't yield 10 servings in this house. It's an OK strawberry coffee cake but there are others that I prefer. Thanks Manasi but I'll probably stick with the other recipe which works better for us.",
