Here are a few comments that might help other people: I substituted a lemon juice & milk mix for buttermilk (just google \"buttermilk substitute\" and you'll easily find that simple recipe). I used dark brown sugar instead of light brown, and whole wheat flour.  I used a casserole dish with an 8\" radius (smaller than the baking dish shown in the video) and I needed only about half the pistachio-nut mixture to cover the top, so I'm freezing the other half to use when I make the dish the next time.  And one final word, perhaps mainly for novice cooks like me: The raw sweet potatoes were HARD to cut! Don't cut them the long ways first, as shown in the video -- my knife got stuck when I did that. Better to cut the short way through first so you can get some leverage with the knife. They were so hard to cut that I actually nicked my fingers twice -- so use caution when cutting them.\r\nBut anyway the dish got raves from folks at our Thanksgiving table.",

I make it exactly as written except that I use a little more vanilla extract and I have to use a gluten-free all-purpose flour. I use King Arthur's multipurpose flour and it comes out great. I usually use the pistachios, but have also used pecans and both are delicious. We love it. The pinch of cayenne may sound weird to some, especially if you're new to Chef John's recipes, but don't question it, just do it.",
