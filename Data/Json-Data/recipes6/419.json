It was sweet but the sweetness did not overwhelm the banana taste. My kids love bananas but my 14-month old seem to think this muffin was too chewy and wouldn't eat very much of it (but he is not a huge fan of bread.) My daughter said she liked it but only ate half of it (which may mean nothing since she is an extremely picky eater.) My kids may not be crazy about them but I really liked them.",
