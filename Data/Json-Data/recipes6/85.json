I used more chopped onions, added fresh pressed garlic, added a \"glob of peach preserves, substituted apple cider vinegar for the lemon, and  added bell pepper chunks and sliced canned pineapple (both near the end).  I thickened the sauce to use as gravy over rice.  Next time I will cut the onions in big chunks and add red food coloring for a more traditional looking dish.  I love the ease of using a crock pot.   I will make this often.  Thanks.",

There was juice in there at the end and my pork did not come out dry at all. The flavor was sweet but not overly sweet. I still loved eating my pork with applesauce. With some green beans on the side. This was a great supper and I enjoyed eating it with my boyfriend by my side.",
