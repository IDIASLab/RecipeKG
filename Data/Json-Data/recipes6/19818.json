This is a dense cake and I never bake it in round pans I think it is do heavy to make a good layer cake.  I always make a sheet cake out of it.  I also usually serve with warm berries and whip cream.  I mostly use blackberries and blueberries.  I heat them in a sauce pan on low until they start to \"melt down\" then I add some honey and bring it to a boil.  I then thicken it into a sauce with cornstarch.  Thought I would add that note!  Hope it helps those looking at this recipe.",

I can see where using the recipe as is would produce very thin layers.  She also upped the vanilla a bit, and used lactose-free milk and Smart Balance instead of butter for her lactose intolerant sister.  The cake was moist and flavorful, more yellow than white, and great with chocolate frosting and surrounded by strawberries.",

I made this cake today for my husbands birthday...and I think it turned out great! I used a melted coating of chocolate and peanut butter and served with fresh strawberries couldn't have asked for better! The cake did not stick, as I floured the bottom of the cake pan. Bottom line is I think it is wonderful, the history behind it is beautiful...and if you want Betty Crocker or Duncan Hines, go to the store. If you want to indulge in a little history...use this a a keeper! :)",

I read the previous reviews and made the changes suggested including really greasing the pan so the cake would come out well (still stuck) and I added a 3rd tsp of baking powder to avoid the flat cake problem the others had (still quite flat and heavy). The cake was also VERY brown around the edges (my oven temperature is correct). I will say that the cake had a good flavor but i will not be making this one again. Off to buy a cake at the bakery.",
