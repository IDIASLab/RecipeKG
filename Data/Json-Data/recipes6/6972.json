Also used two cans of beans because we really like them and let people put their own cheese on top to taste. Took a long time to cook, not sure exactly but it was over an hour. Would also be good with cooked diced chicken I think. Did lack some heat, I added hot sauce to my plate. Maybe some hot peppers added with the onion next time.",
