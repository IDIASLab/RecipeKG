I followed the recipe as written except I used the vanilla extract instead of the bean.  I piped the cream into the puff pastry and then topped with a chocolate ganache. I've always been afraid to make these, but they were not nearly and hard as I thought.  I will definitely make again. I also wanted to freeze these for a party, took a few out of the freezer tonite and the worst part was  waiting for them to defrost.  My husband just ate them frozen.  I don't know if they will last until my party since he knows they are in the freezer.",

Gave it a very intense vanilla flavor. I too was a little skeptical about the amount/choice of flour as a thickener, but no problem there - worked like a charm. No \"flour-y\" taste at all. I did strain the mixture, and it was smooth as silk. Bakery shop quality, and I found a home for a lonely bean that was sitting in my pantry. I could see this going into a lot of things - eclairs, cream puffs, trifle...even eating it alone as a pudding. Tomorrow, it gets used as a filling for a Boston Cream Pie. Good job, Kevin.
