Since then I have eaten quite a few difference chocolate cheesecakes and been able to see a few problems with this first one. All in all it is a great basic recipe for someone who is trying out a chocolate cheesecake for the first time because there is still some plain cheesecake left over of one doesn't like the chocolate. I probably could have gone without the chocolate coating but I used it and had to use milk to make it easier to spread.",
