We had to throw most of it out as it did not set. Also, you NEED to let this COOL at least 24 hours (found this out the hard way too).\n\nWhat I did when I cooked it the second time - I used a 10 inch springform, I cooked it at the 400 for 20 minutes and then I cooked it at 235 degrees for an 1 hour and 35 minutes and it came out perfect. \n\nI took everyone's suggestions - I put some toffee in the cheesecake, and saved some chocolate for on TOP of the cheesecake. I had one SMALL crack, and the chocolate hid it, and then I topped with toffee bar bits.\n\nI made this for someone's birthday at work. Everyone said it was the best cheesecake they have ever had and they all told me their birthday's and begged me to make it for theirs. I work with one lady who bakes all the time, and she said she was throwing out her cheesecake recipe and wanted this one. It's sure to please if cooked all the way!!",

                "reviewBody": "TEN STARS! This was the MOST wonderful cheesecake I've ever made and I make lots of cheesecakes! I followed another reviewers suggestions and some of my own and did the following: (1) Used a 10inch springform pan (it filled it all the way to the top). (2) Reserved 1/4 choc-carmel sauce for topping (had to warm it up before drizzling over top). (3) Mixed about double the amount of toffee chips into the cheesecake batter instead of putting them on top of the choc-carmel sauce layer. (4) Cooked the entire time at 225 until the internal temp reached 160-165 (If your temp doesn't reach this range the interior of the cake will be uncooked all the way and will appear sloshy). (5) You'll have to bake longer than the 1 hour suggested - mine took over 2 hours at this temp. Next time I'll try raising the temp to 250 so I'm not waiting so long. These tips really made a difference. I also used about double the amount of toffee chips on top of the cheesecake than what the recipe called for. It is a beautiful cheesecake and the taste is amazing. Definitely water bath the cake while baking - it really does help. Thanks for a fabulous post! A new family favorite!",

Also the back time for me was around a total of 2 hours and it turned out great.  Use as much toffee bar as you can, the more you use the better it will taste.

                "reviewBody": "Incredible cheesecake thank you for sharing the recipe Nancy!!! I took this to an out of balance potluck (there were only 2 entrees a few side dishes and the rest were desserts) yet this dessert went first!! Like others I did make changes: 10 1/2\" spring form pan (cuts down cooking time)but the pan was so large I did not do a bath--Ijust put a pan of water underneath and there were NO cracks put 4 bars in cake mixture-3 on top put 1/2 carmel/chocolate mixture over crust--half on top with 3 crushed candy bars and last--I bake it at 350o for a half hour then turned the heat down to 250 to finish for about 1 1/2 hours--cooking it slower reduces the chance of cracks. Simply wonderful!!",

                "reviewBody": "If this cheesecake was possible to cook in this method it would be delicious. I followed the recipe exactly accept for mixing the toffee pieces into the cheesecake portion instead of sprinkling it onto the caramel layer. As for the baking portion following previous reviews I baked it for 2 hours instead of one it still did not completely cook all the way through. The center was too soft and slightly runny. The taste however was great and I will make it again. The next time I will cook it at a higher temperature. EDIT Tried this agin this time I baked it at 350 degrees for 1 hour with a jelly roll pan of water on the lower rack and then left it in the oven for another hour. It came out perfect!!",
