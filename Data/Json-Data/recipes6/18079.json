It seemed to work better, as nobody I know enjoys biting into a huge chunk of onion. I stir fried the veggies, prepared the meat as stated, but did NOT add the vegies to the sweet and sour sauce. If you do that you will get soggy vegetables, that will kill all the niceness of having them in this dish. Leave the veggies on the side, until a few minutes before serving, THEN mix them in. You will have crisp vegetables to offset the pork losing its crunchyness from the sweet and sour sauce. Or you can not put the pork in either, until ready to serve, and everything is crispy.",

The only changes I make are to add carrots and use whatever color bell peppers are prettiest when I'm shopping. I also usually double this recipe for our family of five (plus leftovers for lunch, yay!) and so use a mix of peppers. Oh, and for the sauce I drain the pineapple (unsweetened) juice into a measuring cup, add a splash of maraschino cherry juice, then add water to bring it up to what the recipe calls for.  Then I cook my sauce on the stovetop while I'm frying / stirfrying. Once it's slightly thickened I add the pineapple.\n\n But overall, this is a PERFECT recipe. Don't wimp out, deep fry the pork, everyone will be thrilled that you did! *Update* Now several years after my initial review I just wanted to add that two out of three of my kids request this as their birthday dinner every year. The whining/begging/wheedling starts about three weeks in advance! (I'm no slouch around the kitchen, but this is a recipe for when you feel like hanging in the kitchen for a bit, it definitely takes me about 2 hours.)",

Does take a lot of prep work, but agree now that I am familiar with the dish, will move much faster the next time.  You could actually prep the meat in the egg mixture the night before and marinate it, along with cutting up the vegetables, and that will save a lot of time.  Sauce can probably be mixed the night before and refrigerated to save time also.",

Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe! My whole family loved this. Everyone had seconds. I used pork tenderloin instead.

The amount of sugar worked out to 10 cups... we cut it to 5 cups and it was really tasty.   We can't even imagine how sweet it would be with the full amount of sugar that was suggested.  We also didn't deep fry the pork or use the egg whites. We did season the pork and let it marinate for an hour while we got the veggies and sauce ready.  Then we cooked the seasoned pork in the oven at 375\u00baF for 45 minutes - 1 hour until it was fully cooked.  We made the sauce separately only using the pineapple juice, the pineapple and the water, ketchup, vinegar, lesser amount of sugar,  adding 3 cups of sliced waterchestnuts  for crunch.  We cooked the sauce ingredients and then thickened it with the cornstarch and cold water.  After cooking it for 5 more minutes we mixed in the cooked pork.  It was wonderful.  We made pork fried rice to go with it.  SO THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF MY DIATRIBE IS TO SAY \"TRY THE RECIPE WITH ONLY HALF OF THE SUGAR IN THE SAUCE, DON'T DEEP FRY THE PORK AND IT WILL BE MORE NUTRITIOUS.\"  WE used the diced veggies for the fried rice.",

Personally, i like my pork crunchy so i fry it and add the sauce before serving my plate, for my husband who likes his pork softened i add the pork to the sauce itself.  Excellent recipe, tastes pretty close to the resteraunt, only it hasnt been sitting in a buffet getting who knows what put in it!  Great recipe, thanks to Pam for posting it!",
