My favorite part of the recipe was actually the bison. I will definitely buy ground bison again. It cooks up quickly and has very little grease compared to other similar ground meats I have tried cooking. As far as the recipe, I followed it as is except I used low-sodium canned products, reduced fat dairy, and whole grain pasta I had leftover from another dish. I found the recipe requires 3 cups cooked (2 oz of dry pasta, equals 1 cup cooked). On the bake time I also had to reduce it by almost 10 minutes, so it did not dry out. Lastly, I blended the sauce after trying it. It looked and tasted too much like just sour cream with some green onions and cilantro mixed in. I added the sauce ingredients to the blender along with juice from half the lime I had grated and a pinch of garlic salt. It turned out very well that way. ty",

You can use any pasta or rice with this that you happen to have on hand.  I would make this recipe again, changing up the spices again.  Thanks!",

I jazzed up the cream sauce (which I made with parsley instead of cilantro for personal preference) with a bit of lime juice and some cumin but I think everything was pretty fantastic.

We all agreed that the dish was better with regular sour cream instead of the Cilantro-Lime Cream though. I made this according to the directions except that I doubled the spices and added Salt and pepper at the end. Next time I will mix cheese into the mixture as well as on the top. Although it wasn't dry I would have liked a little bit more moisture. Perhaps I would have saut\u00e9d some chopped onion in a little EVOO and add that into the mixture. But that is just personal preference. All in all I think this was a nice meal and the bison was very good. It's a little time consuming to make which would make me want to make this more on the weekends or an occasional weeknight when there's time. Although I think that it could be easily prepped in advance. This is worth making. Try the Bison as it had a nice flavor and texture. I liked the dark cooked meat it has a nicer color than ground beef has. I served this with a green salad corn on the cobb cornbread and a mixed fruit salad The leftovers would make a nice lunch on the following day. I will make this again.",
