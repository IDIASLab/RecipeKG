So I cut the flour to 2 1/2 cups, changed the cornmeal to 1 cup, and dropped the water.  It turned out quite nicely, everyone complimented me.  It had much more of a cornbread flavor than the original recipe (according to some other reviewers) and spread with butter at the table tasted great.  I liked it that I didn't have to turn on the oven and heat up the kitchen when it was already unseasonably hot.  Cold ham, cold potato salad, cold broccoli salad, and this bread to fill up my kids who aren't old enough to appreciate the salads, made it a very nice meal.",

The cornmeal also provided wonderful texture, and the slight flavor of corn was apparent. Milk and egg in the ingredients didn't hurt either.  Reminiscent of a corn flavored brioche. Phenomenal crust---and lastly, try making toast from this bread, and you'll be very happy.",
