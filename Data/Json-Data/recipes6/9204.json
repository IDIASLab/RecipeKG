The cake mix was 16 oz, so I added a little cake flour to get it up to 18.25 oz.  I\u2019m quite happy with the way this turned out. Served today with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprig of fresh mint. Super simple to make, a firm crust that cut well into bars/squares, had nice eye appeal, and tasted good!  The best way to describe its texture is fudgy/chocolaty.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed it",

I was helping a friend clean out their parents house, and we needed dinner and of course dessert.  In the pantry I found most of these ingredients, so I made it!  The one thing I didn't have was a 13x9 pan so I made it in an 11x7.  It was way too much chocolate for the smaller pan, but it was good.  I also added walnuts on top because I had them.  I'd make this again in a bigger pan, and despite the serious amount of chocolate, it helped with the family grief and was very yummy!",
