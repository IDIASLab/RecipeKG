                "reviewBody": "The flavor of this loaf is pretty insipid even when toasted. The dough was also quite sticky and needed about an extra half cup of flour to be able to be handled easily while still remaining relatively soft. Generally the proportion of liquid to 3 cups of flour in a bread recipe is 1 cup not 1-1/4 cups. The taste is definitely dominated by whole wheat and as such it didn't taste to us remotely like English muffins. Flavor-wise it lacks salt but adding more might inhibit the dough's ability to rise so do so judiciously. The grain is too close and fine to resemble English muffins. None of the requisite \"nooks and crannies\" associated with them. The rising technique was definitely cool however. I'll remember it when I need to get my yeast breads to rise in a hurry. Since my microwave is pretty powerful I used 40% power for the rise stage and even so only had to give it the 1 minute/10 minute wait twice before it rose to 2\" above the pan. Interesting premise but flavor is decidedly lackluster.",
