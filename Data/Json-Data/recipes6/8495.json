Just cook it longer the more done you want it. Easy p easy and super delicious. Thanks for helping with my cook time and such :). Cooked with mashed sallys spinach mashed potatoes, a salad, and au jus gravy with mushrooms and buscuits. Crab dip for an appetizer and apple crisp for dessert.  Happy Christmas eve!",

Ideal for a nice hearty meal with the family.\n\nFlyinghippy: You obviously arent competent enough to read the directions and follow them accordingly which is why your roast was garbage. Firstly, after searing it at 500 degrees, the oven temperature is supposed to drop to 325, not 375 like you posted. Secondly, the recipe calls for a roast of 4 lbs, so the cook time will need to be adjusted if your roast was smaller.  Im guessing your roast was around 3 lbs, so it only needed about 1 hour after the 20 minute searing for a rare cut. Follow the recipe closer next time for great results.",

The first time we did it with a 4.5 lb roast, but instead of salt and pepper we did Montreal steak seasoning. Tonight was a about a 2 lb roast. This time I put the butter and garlic in the mini food processor, and again used Montreal instead of salt & pepper. We did it at 500 degrees for 15 minutes and then shut the oven off to get it to 145. EXCELLENT!! I definitely recommend getting a digital meat thermometer (I paid like $14 for this one with a probe and a wire) It has saved numerous pieces of meat.. I'm  calling this Prime Ribeye....",
