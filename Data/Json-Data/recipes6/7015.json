The fruitiness of the pineapple, the heat of the jalapeno, the creaminess of the cheese, and the hit of ginger you get from the burgers themselves, all come together in a perfect flavor harmony. I did find that the burger patties didn't have a very strong flavor when eaten alone, however. I felt the could have used more seasoning, maybe more teriyaki sauce, and since I used about 2 tsps of minced ginger, I'd say more ginger as well. I also topped the burger with lettuce, tomato, and extra sauteed onion--and would do so again. Overall, a great variation on the classic burger, and definitely worth making again! (Note: I used ground dark chicken meat, and that made the burgers stay nice and juicy!)",
