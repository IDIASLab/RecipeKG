When I mixed the soy sauce and water it created such a gluey thick paste that I couldn't actually rub it on the chicken. I altered that step and first sprinkled chicken with flour and then added the soy suace and mixed it together. It mixed well. I added an extra teaspoon of ginger two extra tablespoons of sugar and one extra tablespoon of tamarind paste. I also used ginger paste instead of the actual cloves. It was so much tastier! My personal alteration was adding steamed brocoli and carrot in at the very end without cooking it further and garnishing it with red pepper flakes Coriander and spring onion. It was absolutely delicious!!",
