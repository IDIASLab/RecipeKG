Usually, I make strawberry rhubarb pie and strawberry rhubarb jam, but I had an angel food cake on hand and decided on the rhubarb sauce.  After reading the reviews, I decided to use a cup of bing cherries I also had on hand and a dash of red food coloring; I also added a bit of vanilla extract.  My mother used to make Rhubarb Sauce every summer, and it brought back memories.  I'm going to freeze the extra sauce for use throughout the year.",
