They were really good!  I was skeptical that there would be enough filling for all 18, but it worked out.  If you like your quiches a little on the fuller side, you may want to make extra filling, because there's just enough to fill them a little bit.  I realized that you need to roll out the dough to really hang over your dishes because it shrinks a little during the first 5 minute baking time.  I used beans because I didn't have pie weights, and they did stick a little, but they came out with a little help. I reheated one for breakfast this morning, and it was still really good.  We have a b&b, so will be adding these to the menu for sure.  I think you could use whatever cheese and other filling ingredients you wanted, and it would work well.",
