Only changes I made - softened the cream cheese in the microwave, then mixed all the spices into it before adding the noodles. I've played with the spices a bit too,basically use whatever you like. My fav is minced garlic, garlic powder, oregano and a little bit of fresh minced basil. Sometimes I add a little fennel to give it a lasagna taste. I also added some sour cream once because I was short on cream cheese and it turned out fine.\n\nSuper easy recipe. Thanks for sharing!",
