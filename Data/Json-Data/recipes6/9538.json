One thing that isn't addressed in the recipe is the copious amounts of liquid that result from the cooking process. There was SO much liquid, resulting in something that was closer to a soup than a veggie side dish.  I also found that much of the feta melted.  I think if I were making it again, I'd cook the chard a bit longer by itself, then drain the liquid. Then, after adding the tomatoes and cheese, I'd reduce the cook time, really just allowing for a quick toss and heat through. That would reduce the amount of liquid to cook out of the tomatoes, and would also reduce the amount of cheese melt. The flavors were delicious, but I think these changes might better suit my personal preferences.",
