I used only 3/4 c and they came out very good. My batter was not spreadable at all, that may be from cutting back on the butter. I flattened the dough between parchment paper (on the bottom) and wax paper on the top and used a rolling pin. Then I just peeled off the wax paper, transferred the batter on parchment paper to a cookie sheet, sprinkled the almonds and baked it all. This is such an elegant looking cookie for the amount of effort that it takes. \"It's not a cookie, it's an almond thin.\" Thanks for a keeper!",

The dough is too sticky unless you chill it. Then I took a melon baller and scouped a small ball of dough. After that I took a glass with a flat bottom dipped it in water and squished the ball flat twisting to release from dough. After that I baked for 25 minutes until they were light golden brown. The orginal timing wasn't nearly enough but I am not sure if that is because of my oven or not. Also be CERTAIN to use parchment paper!",

I could not get this batter to spread please give me the secret! I tried a spatula icing knife and a rolling pin. I ended up making rolled cookies out of them and pressed them out with a cookie cutter. I almost threw the second batch of batter away but I poured about 3/4 cup of almonds onto the mound and kneaded it in prior to rolling them out. That worked even better! They turned out pretty and tasty. Great recipe for taste but didn't work out according to the directions for me! thank you for sharing Violet! I WILL make these again - rolling them!",

I am at my mountain cabin and intended to get started on some holiday baking but I didn't realize that I didn't have one of the ingredients I needed for the almond cookies I was going to make. I read all the reviews here and decided \"really how bad could this be?\". Well I found out that the original recipe as published has a huge \"hassle\" factor. Yes it was hard to roll..and I took others' advice and used parchment. Be sure to get it think enough in the middle! I rebaked mine (the center part) twice. Used a pizza cutter to cut it. For the second half I just rolled in balls and rolled in sugar flattened with a glass over a little hunk of parchment. They turned out brown and crispy on the edges but not very festive looking. I think a little almond flavoring might be helpful also. It wasn't worth the effort!",
