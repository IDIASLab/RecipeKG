A pastry chef told me the general rule is to use a 10 in. if the recipe calls for 4- 8 oz. packages of cream cheese and an 8 or 9 in. for 3- 8 oz. packages or less. Use the cheap dry cookies for the crust otherwise you will have to lessen the butter.",

I baked it in a 450 degree oven as the recipe required and the top had a tough skin looking overcooked and brown. The kitchen smelled like I had burned something. I still had 22 minutes to go and decided to reduce the temperature to 350 and cover the cheesecake with foil. I do not think that I cooked it long enough but felt that the 450 temperature had to be a mistake. The cheescake was tasty and the macaroon crust/top was delicious. It was however not cooked enough in the middle but no one seemed to notice or care. It did not crack or split. I am curious about the cooking temperature and ways to prevent the over-browning of the top. 450 degrees seems a little too hot. Any suggestions?",

First of all I had the same problem as another reviewer the 450 temperature seemed too hot. I too had to turn the temperature down after about 40 minutes. I covered the top with foil to keep it from getting any darker and baked it for another 20 minutes. After removing it from the oven and letting it set for two hours I removed the cake from the pan and it was completely uncooked in the centre! So I forced it back into the pan and baked it for another hour at 350 and it was okay after that...not pretty but okay. A little whipped cream and some sliced almonds on top prettied it up a bit. So I'll definitely know what to do for next time and by the way the taste was great!",

Deciding that the farenheight/celsius degrees had been accidently switched I chose to bake my cheescake at the 230 temp. Well I ended up baking it for 2 hours! I was really disappointed because this had been the dessert that I had been bragging about for the week leading up to Thanksgiving. I still brough it and people liked it but it never set to the right consistency even after 2 hours. Very good taste just wish it had been easier to make and had set right.",
