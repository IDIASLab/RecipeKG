I omitted the hoisin sauce, Chinese 5-spice powder, & brown sugar, as the seasoning blend had some of those elements. It was delicious, with tongue-tingling, savory flavor without being overly hot. I plan to make again (for the reviewer who wondered about the Ramen seasoning, I chose to use just 1 packet)",
