I think these really do fit the bill. These are normally made with strawberry preserves, but here we're using fresh strawberries for a little lighter and lower-sugar approach. For best results, refrigerate before serving.",

When i finally made it, it was so easy i wondered why i put it off so long. \nSo, the main thing, i forgot brown sugar so the only sweetener was probably less than a 1/4 sugar in the strawberries. And honestly? Pretty  good. My strawberries were very tart but i only missed the sweetness a little.\nI also made this in a 7x11 pan for thicker bars are i personally feel like that was a good choice.\nI also browned my butter a bit instead of just melting it.\nI also ate a piece warm and was dying to slap a scoop of ice cream on it cause it would have been perfect.
