For years I have searched for a recipe for true French dressing that I could make fresh at home and finding this one makes me so happy. I have made this recipe both with homemade mayo and with Hellmman s and find them equally good (Hellmman s also makes a good bottled French dressing; It is also a creamy orange dressing with no tomatoes or catsup as are most of the other major brands of French).",
