I didn't have any almonds so I put in a little almond extract. We love the tid bits of cocoanut. really makes this cake special. I only had one egg so I put in a t. baking powder and it is so light and fluffy I might do it this way every time! Real butter is a must if you want that rich taste. Oh and the finished cake is very pretty with a golden brown top. Nice looking (quick and easy) company cake for us that have loads of rhubarb!",

Combine 6 Tbsp. melted butter, 2/3 cup brown sugar. 1/4 cup cream, 1 cup coconut and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Spread on cake.  Brown lightly under broiler.  Thanks for the recipe.",
