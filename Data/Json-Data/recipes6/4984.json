Especially with the particuarly combo with the carrots, mushrooms, and quinoa I did not think it would be my dish.\n\nHowever, it turned out to be a very simple, but tasty dish. It was a great dish to have for lunch leftovers for multiple days. Highly recommend and highly recommend keeping it simple.\n\nAdded to my top recipes. Not as fancy or flavorful as those dishes, but the simplicity and comfort of the dish makes it a great everyday, filling, lunch.",
