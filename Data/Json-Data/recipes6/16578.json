There are a few things wrong with this - One not people use an electric coffee make for tea only....if you use your coffee make for coffee too it is going to leave a funny taste in your tea. Also You never specified what kind of tea to buy...that is important I'vew had people come up and ask me all the time. I make teas the following way: 7 regular sized Orange Pekoe Tea Bags (orange peko is the type of tea leaf its generally what is used in Lipton and your other brands...but double check. It doesn't taste like oranges either. 1 1/2 Cups of Sugar for a 1 gallon pitcher. Put tea bags in small pot and put on stove with about 3 cups of water...give or take. You want the tea bags covered so the bigger the pot the more water you have to use. Bring tea to a boil and let it roll for 2-3 minutes. Turn tea off. let tea sit in pot for 10-15 minutes. While this is happeneing fill you pitcher up half way with WARM water. Hot is good too but it takes longer to cool off. Put sugar in warm water in stir vigourously. The secert to sweet tea is adding your sugar to warm liquid to melt the sugar so it doesn't all all to the bottom. Next add your tea then you can either fill the pitcher the rest of the way up with water and refridgerate or...put ice in it to fill it up and drink. But remember...if you drink it before the ice melts it might be a little sweet.",
