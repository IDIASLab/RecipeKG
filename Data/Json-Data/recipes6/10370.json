I baked mine for about 40 minutes because some reviewers said the 35 wasn't enough.  Next time I will do it for about 45 minutes because I think it could have used the additional 5 minutes.  Although there are a lot of spices added into the bread, it has a very subtle flavor.  If you're really looking for something where you can distinctly taste the flavors, I would recommend doubling the spices and herbs.  I served this bread with the Spinach and Artichoke Lasagna recipe (HIGHLY recommended) on this site, and I also fixed some bruschetta to go with it.  Next time I will find a different Italian bread recipe to go with the bruschetta because this bread came out dense, heavy, and soft whereas bruschetta is best served on crispy and light bread.",
