I read the reviews before I made these and noticed many comments said they were bland, so I looked up typical salt-to-flour ratios for yeast breads, and the amount was off by 2 teaspoons, more if more flour is used while kneading.  (Ratio is 1/2 teaspoon salt per 1 cup flour.)  I didn't have shortening so I substituted butter for that, and since shortening is 100% fat and butter is 20% water (if you use typical butter--European butter has a higher fat content), I used a tablespoon more butter (so 5 tablespoons were used) for rubbing into the flour, and took away a tablespoon of water from the 3 cups.  These were amazing!!!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!!!",

I made half a batch (about 24 rolls) and they were all gone the next day - the kids wanted to take them to school for lunch.  Thanks for the recipe, MOMMY2THREEANGELS, I'll be making these again and again and probably during the holidays too. Update:  I like to scale the recipe down to 15 servings and make the dough in my bread machine. I've replaced up to 1/3 of the flour with ww flour. I don't make these as often as my kids request because I usually eat too many (the big reason why I never make a full batch). Enjoy!",

This being my FIRST time baking bread not to mention my limited cooking skills in general.....I felt pretty brave just for trying. Well....I hate to admit allowing him to do this......but he ate FOUR of these rolls right out of the oven!! His comment: \"Mom I never say this about your home cooking but (as he placed his fingers at his mouth and saluted me with a kiss!).....SUPERB!!!\" He then went on to tell me that my rolls blew the cafeterias OUT OF THE WATER! Wow! What a compliment! My heart SOARED and I was filled with pride! LOL. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!",
