The half cup of sugar and 2 tsp of ground cinnamon at the end is only mixed and sprinkled on top of cookies before they are baked it is not to be added to the cookie dough. These are a traditional cookie in my family and are delicious. When you bake them do not over bake they will appear to be not fully cooked but they are let them cool some before eating. Enjoy!",

My first batch were crisp and they stuck to the bottom of the pan even though it was greased. We added more flour (maybe a little too much) to get the dough less sticky and to give the cookies more substance. That worked- too well. They were very floury and thick. So we added more of everything and they came out similar to the first ones but better. I don't know if it was really worth it and I don't think I will make these again.",
