I followed exactly with the following exceptions:-).: I always start out using only half oil called for and then add to taste did not add salt to dressing and lastly used just a squirt of Srichachi hot sauce. Dressing to die for yummy sticks to the leaves and not overly oily..very tangy. Salad itself can have stuff added to your tastes: I used sundried tomatoes and next time will also add fresh thin sliced mushrooms. Making for Christmas Eve dinner to cut the richness of the man dish. To let you know how good this is it's the first recipe I've ever reviewed and I've used allrecipes.com for years now.",

And I'm happy to report I was right! We loved it! I made half the dressing as written but cut back on the salt adding it to taste. I made it a day ahead to allow the flavors to meld and the next morning I poured some over skinless boneless chicken and let it marinate all day. When grilling Hubs basted the chicken with some additional dressing which gave it a beautiful sheen. Hubs couldn't stop raving about it so I'm sure we'll be repeating this one and often! And I'm sure I'll be trying the salad as well. It sounds wonderful!",
