I didn't read any of the reviews or perhaps I wouldn't have tried it. And initially after the first taste from the bowl I thought I'd made a mistake in making it. But now I'm not so sure... First of all it's marshmallow frosting to the T! It's sticky gooey and even my 4-year-old daughter thought it tasted just like marshmallow. I wasn't too happy with that since I was going for a light airy frosting (like seven minute!) Anyway I had made it it came out correctly so I slathered it on the dark chocolate cake we had made. The recipe makes a TON but you'll need it because if you try to spread this too thin you'll be picking up cake like mad. Turns out this recipe on dark chocolate cake---tastes like heaven! I'm not sure what it reminds me of something like Sno Balls but fresher and no coconut (although coconut on it would be awesome!) You can tell I'm a child of the 70s! Next time though I'll make cupcakes (dark chocolate of course). The cake really is quite hard to cut cleanly. I also don't know yet how this will store--or even where to store it. For now it'll stay on my counter. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I'm not sure how this will hold up over the next 24 hours. As it's cooling it's getting quite stiff and it may just be because when cooking the syrup I went just a",

It was more of a marshmallow. Now if I had used my brain and thought of the process and thought yeah that's how you make fluff then I would have known. Unfortunately I don't always use my brain the way I should when I am freaking out about finding a tasty vanilla frosting since I ran out of powdered sugar. I was a little worried about making the recipe since I had have recently broken my candy thermometer and I haven't replaced it yet. So here is a bit of help for those without a thermometer. It will boil after a few minutes on high. Keep it at a really rolling boil I like mine a few notches down from the highest heat just for safety reasons. Its going to boil for a long long time. Then it will look white with bubbles this does not mean it is done. Just because it is syrupy doesn't mean it is done. Its got to get really nice and thick and will look a bit yellow. It took me over 15 minutes to get it to this point but it can take you longer or shorter. Good luck I hope this helped some people. It is mildly hard to explain some of it just comes with making this sort of thing a lot.",
