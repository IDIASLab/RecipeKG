I probably should have made it earlier in the day - after 5 hours in the fridge, the filling still wasn't properly set.  However, my mashed peaches were very ripe and therefore watery, which could be partially to blame.  Next time I'll leave out the water and see what happens.\r\nEven though it ran all over their plates, my guests liked this pie so much that they asked for the recipe.",
