I put in 2 cups of rhubarb with 3 cups of crushed pineapple. I did NOT put in marshmallows. I used the reserved pineapple juice in the cake mix instead of water. I have 4 kids (8 years old and younger) who loved this recipe. They loved the red glaze on top. And had me make it for their slumber party. 2 of the kids at the party told me they hated rhubarb but loved my cake. I'm definitely going to do this more often.",

What I did different on mine was first arrange chopped rhubarb in pan then mix jello (I used sugar free raspberry)with the sugar sprinkle that over the rhubarb then sprinkle the marshmallows over that evenly then spread the cake batter. After baking COOL for 10 minutes then run your knife around the edges and invert onto a foil covered cookie sheet (or whatever you plan to use). Then I covered mine with Saran Wrap and placed it in the fridge to cool completely. Serve cold and store it in the refrigerator! Great recipe!",
