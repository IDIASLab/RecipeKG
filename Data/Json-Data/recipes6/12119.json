Real butter is a key, though!  I found no need to mix the flour in by hand.  I used my KitchenAid mixer and it came together just fine.  My five-year old was amazed by the \"magic\" of the cookie press, and loved the taste.  She said, \"These are so good.  I think we could SELL them!\"  The recipe came together fast, and the baking time is so short.  We were able to make mountains of cookies in no time.  One note: If you are sprinkling sugar or other decorations on the cookies, do that BEFORE you bake.  Otherwise, the sugar will not stick in my experience.",

It also works well for stamped cookies, as they keep their crisp patterns. Remember that these cookies rely on real butter for much of their flavor. Substitutions will not only not taste nearly as good, but may affect the consistency of the dough. You CAN substitute different flavorings for the vanilla. Try almond, peppermint (perhaps with crushed candy on top and/or coloring the dough pink), rum, orange or lemon. The dryness of flours may vary, but this should be a stiff but kneadable dough that can be packed into the cookie press. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks!",
