This is a very good recipe for both the dough and the sauce, I do however think that this dough IS better when rolled into a 14 inch double dough pizza vs. the 2 12 inch pies (baked the same time as the recipe states for the 12\").  I tripled this and let everyone make their own. It rolled nicely and didn't stick...which is a plus to me.  It did sorta lack something (spice wise)...not sure what, but I will absolutely make it again and figure that one out.  I had no complaints on the sauce at all....actually I was a little leary because it started out spaghetti sauce like, but thickened really well, and tasted delish.  My 5 year old rolled and topped his own pizza and had a blast doing it.  Thanks for the great recipe Mike I got 5 stars all around.",

The sauce is really tomatoey and reminds me of an italian spaghetti/pasta sauce in fact it would be a great dipping sauce with bread sticks. Crust I fiddled around with it's easier to use another favorite one rather than try to keep tweaking this one. The sauce is worth keeping dough is okay it does have great crispy crackery texture and all. ORIGINAL REVIEW: This was fantastic. I got two 14 inch thin crust pizzas from this. The crust was very thin light and delicate nicely crispy too. Like a cracker when I baked this on a perforated sheet on lowest oven rack. Dough was really stiff and seemed dry but I followed directions and it turned out great. Not a lot of flavor but then does crust need a lot when it is a base? The sauce was really decent too. I made two pizzas and still froze some for another. This had some different ingredients than I am used to using for pizza sauce like the comino and chili powder. I didn't change a thing and really don't need too. Even though the crust could use some flavor the texture is outstanding so it makes up for it. We all liked this and I will make it again. Thanks Mike this was great!",
