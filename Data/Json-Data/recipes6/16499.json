It tastes more like peanut butter than like sugar which was what I was looking for in a peanut butter pie recipe... if you like that too then I suggest adding 1/2 tsp of salt to the recipe to really bring up the peanut butter flavor. I am making it again this weekend... my husband loved it so much that he requested it for his birthday instead of cake.",
