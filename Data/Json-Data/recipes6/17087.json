I usually do half white and half whole wheat flour and I add a bit of ground flax seed too. I have done strawberry and raspberry. But our favorite was using my homemade Wild Maine Blueberry freezer jam. Oh So Good! They do crumble a bit at first but if they cool all the way they hold together just fine. I am going to have to try putting nuts in it too. I bet that's a great addition. Thank you wwgirl.",

I made easy even easier by combining all ingredients in the food processor. A few pulses and you're done! Good short texture to the cookie part. Used 1/3 butter and 2/3 margarine in order to give a little more flavor. I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 and made in two 9\" square pans one with raspberry and one with strawberry. Both are tasty. Because eggs don't divide well I couldn't use 1-1/2 eggs. I used 2 eggs and the dough wasn't crumbly at all. I flattened pieces to lay on top. Both varieties were done at 30 minutes. Sprinkled with powdered sugar for a pretty finish. Note: These bars can be made with fresh berries too. See Berry Crumb Bars on this website which is almost identical (with the exception of replacing preserves with fresh fruit.)",

I only had half a jar of seedless raspberries so I added the only thing I had left in the fridge...grape jelly (that could explain the sweetness)!!! There are crumbly and at first I didn't think they would bake up very well. Make sure you let the bars cool completely before trying to cut since they do crumble easily. However we couldn't stop eating them!!! I would like to try these with other jam and jelly fillings next time.",

I also lined my 9X13 pan with wax paper and sprayed with non-stick spray. It made it a little easier to get the bars out of the pan without breaking them.
