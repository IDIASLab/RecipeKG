I followed the recipe exactly and I'm an accomplished baker. The first problem I ran into was that the chocolate chips would not melt. After 5 minutes in the oven (as the recipe states) the chocolate chipswould not swirl. The filling was just beginnig to warm up at that point. Three minutes later the chips still weren't melted but the filling was beginning to firm up on the top. I used Nestle mini morsels which I ended up leaving \"as is\" on top of the filling. The next problem I ran into was removing the tarts from the pan. After coolling slightly the tarts were impossible to remove from the pan without breaking. After cooling longer the bottoms of the tarts stuck in many of the cups and were left behind when the tarts were removed. The saving grace is the taste. The recipe also calls for one egg but it should call for just one egg YOLK as the white is not used in the tarts.",
