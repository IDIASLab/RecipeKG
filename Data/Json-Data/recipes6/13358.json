I used about 2/3 c of sugar, because I always eat blackberry pie with ice cream and I wanted it to be a little tart. And, I didn't put anything on the crust because I didn't have an egg. Everyone loved it. It was a little runny, probably due to the extra berries. The extra juice can be spooned over the accompanying ice cream. Ahhh... life is good.",

A few suggestions though: I used only 1 cup of sugar instead of the extra half because I like a little ice cream on my pie and that makes up for the sugar. Also I used frozen blackberries instead of fresh (since it's winter) and I would make sure to use at least 5 cups if going this way. Tapioca did the trick to keep it from being runny! Will make this again!",
