This is because it has very little salt in the recipe -- a crucial factor in bread \"flavor.\" Definitely increase the salt to between 1 to 1 1/4 tsp, depending on your preferences. You might want to check your favorite bread recipe and see how much salt per cup of flour there is and start with that. Also, if you haven't made focaccia before this recipe is confusing. It doesn't state how thickly to roll the dough. It isn't going to rise a lot so unless you want it to be like a flatbread don't roll it much thinner than you want it to be when you eat it. Also start with adding 1/4 cup of water after you add the yeast/sugar/water mixture and then add a TBS of water at a time till the dough forms into a ball.  ",

The reference to adding additional water means exactly what it says, add enough\nextra water to incorporate all the flour.  You should have a soft dough; if it is stiff then you put too much flour in to begin with.  Dough does not require a second rising but I have experimented with this and found the difference is minimal and whether you dimple your foccacia dough or leave it flat is a matter of choice.  I think dimpling the dough and allowing the oil and seasonings to pool in the dimples adds more flavour to the cooked product.  Try steeping dried Italian herbs in olive oil abd then pouring the lot over the top of your dough.  Delish!\nI find this recipe creates a focaccia that is crisp on the outside and soft on the inside with big airholes perfect for mopping up tomato based sauces.  Don't over think it and give this recipe a go!",

There is lots of room to play with the ingredients. I added 2Tbs white sugar 1/2 cup cornmeal and 1tsp. salt and 1Tbs. Olive oil too the flour and enough water to make a stiff sticky dough I followed the directions kneading 1 minute and letting it rise 30 minutes only once and then brushed on some garlic infused Olive oil and some parmesan cheese with a sprinkle of dried onions and some more course salt. It was amazing!! It was light and crunchy mmmmm!!! I am very proud of myself. Next time I will add some cooked pizza toppings as it only took 10 minutes to bake. I will use this recipe often it's so good and I bet this would make yummy breadsticks!!!",
