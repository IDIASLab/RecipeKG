I had my ground beef cooking away when I discovered that I was out of jarred sauce.  So, I tried this recipe and it was fantastic.  I didn't have any red wine vinegar, but red wine worked great.  I also added about a cup of grated parmesan to thicken it a bit (I like my sauce to be very thick) and give it some extra flavor.  This was so much better than the junk in the jar that I'll definitely stop gettting the stuff in the jar and making this instead.",

I put three (frozen) boneless skinless chicken breasts in the bottom of the crockpot, then added all the rest of the ingredients (with the changes I mentioned above).  I cooked it on LOW for 6 hours -- and when it was almost done, I opened the lid, and shredded the chicken with two forks.  It was sooo good!
