I used one cup of AP flour and one cup of WW flour, which give them a nice texture. Also, I ended up baking these for closer to 40 minutes. The inside was just too gooey at 20 minutes (maybe I added too much milk; I don't know), so watch the time closely and adjust accordingly. Overall, I am quite happy with these.",
