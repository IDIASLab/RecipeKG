I baked it in two round pans lined with parchment for easier removal of the cake and used my own recipe for the filling which is very light and fluffy. Imitation Whipped Cream Filling: Combine 5 T. flour and 1 c. milk and cook until thick. When cool add 1 c. sugar 1/2 c. softened butter and 1/2 c. shortening. Beat at high speed for several minutes until smooth and fluffy.",

I was originally going for a whoopie pie recipe which led me to gob cakes (a name apparently limited to PA borders since I'm in MD and have never heard it called by that name). This recipe sounded the best of the gob cake/whoopie pie selection. One thing I didn't take into account was that this was a \"cake\" so after mixing it it was way too runny to be used for individual whoopie pies. I added an additional 1 - 1 1/2 cups of flour (I didn't measure I just kept adding until the consistency was right). For the icing I used a previous reviewers recipe of 3c powdered sugar 1/3c butter 1t vanilla and 1-2T milk just because the butter and shortening in icing sounded too greasy for me. Overall the whoopie/gob pies were very good and snack time after school for my 3 children was silent (they were too busy devouring the pies to talk).",
