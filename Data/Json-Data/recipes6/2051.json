Unbeatable!\n\nI even froze it with the marinade (after 2 hrs in the refrigerator), defrosting it just before cooking on the grill.  \n\nIt was GREAT!\n\nAs an aside, the Asian Bowl on Young Street, Toronto has an excellent grilled meat plate, including grilled chicken and beef!",

Served them over rice with grilled veggies. My husband AND my 3-year old looooooved it. So yummy! Will definitely make again.",
