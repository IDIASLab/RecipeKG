I found that the recipe makes a large loaf that took a longer time to bake than specified.  So, the next time I made it, I just doubled the batch and made 3 loaves and they baked perfectly.  Also, a double batch uses exactly one bag of fresh/frozen cranberries.  Another thing I did to improve the recipe was to drizzle the top with a powdered sugar icing (milk, vanilla, powdered sugar.)  This icing hardened nicely, and the result was superb!",

I cut my cranberries in half, did a double batch, & baked it in 3 loaf pans, as suggested by one of the reviewers, since my oven seems to be a little slow.  My 3 loaves were done in 55 minutes.  The flavor while still warm is amazing & it is still great after it cools.  It is a rich, well-balanced flavor.  It slices well after it cools completely.  This recipe is a keeper, & when I do it again I will try using 3 8\"x4\" loaf pans. I found the texture to be nice & my bread turned out nicely moist. Thank you to Carol & to the reviewers who had such good suggestions. P.S.  I tried the smaller loaf pans & the loaves came out taller, which I wanted.  They baked in 50 minutes.  The smaller size is easier to wrap in standard width plastic wrap, too.",

The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because it seemed to need a bit more polishing for my tastes.  First, I rough chopped the cranberries because I know that biting into a whole cranberry can be offputting if you're not expecting that bitterness.  Second, I substituted melted butter, not margarine and lastly I added another egg, a touch of vanilla and left out the nuts.  Rather than \"beating in\" the flour, I just gave it a nice stir with a spatula until the flour was \"just\" combined.  Otherwise, your cranberries can break and run.  This bread was really taken up to the final notch with a glaze of powdered sugar, orange juice, orange zest and a touch of vanilla.. I drizzled it on the loaves when it was mildly warm.  So nice and festive and perfect for small gifts in decorative mini loaf pans... thanks so much for sharing.",

I soaked the fresh cranberries in fresh orange juice and added lots of grated orange zest. When mixed the batter is thick, wet and fits right into the greased and floured 9x5 loaf pan. It baked up nicely in one hour and formed a brown colored top. The orange and cranberry scent was very aromatic throughout my house this morning. While I let the bread cool I made a glaze of \u00bd cup of powdered sugar mixed with just a little orange juice and orange zest to drizzle over the bread. The fresh orange juice and zest really emphasizes the fruity quality of this cranberry nut bread just as the submitter stated. The red juicy cranberries were peeking out everywhere in the bread. When sliced it is appealing to look at the cranberries imbedded in the bread as the contrasting colors of red and orange make a pretty bread. The combination of both sweet and tart is balanced in flavor but, nothing overpowering and the orange flavors really pop in the bread \u2013so fresh tasting. The nutty pecans added a nice texture to the bread as well. The glaze just added another sweet layer of flavor. I found the ingredients, directions and baking time spot on. A beautiful delicious bread- perfect for the holidays and to give as gifts!",

First, I don't use fresh cranberries, I used sweetened and dried.  One whole 6 oz package provides approx 1 1/2 cups of cranberries.  this way they are sweeter and distribute more evenly through the bread (since there are more, smaller berries).  I soak the berries in 1 cup of boiling orange juice before adding both to the batter.  This makes the cranberries plumper and they don't suck moisture out of the batter.  the orange juice also absorbs some of the cranberry flavor and color.  I also add about a tsp of vanilla to the wet ingredients. I also add spices to the dry ingredients.  A lot of cinnamon, just enough nutmeg to smell, and some ginger. All combined, this makes a very rich, moist and irresistable quickbread. Also, to make 6 giant muffins, bake for 30 minutes, or bake for 20 minutes in a regular sized muffin tin.",

Turns out that I was right it would have made great biscotti! I think I may leave out the cranberries and use it that way instead - then it will be great! The orange flavor was really nice and the texture is very coarse - perfect for biscotti but not great for a fruit bread.",
