If you want a really smooth taste to the cake you can subsitute a cup of the white sugar with icing sugar (can be done with most recipes) and it really gives it that \"melt in your mouth\" taste.  I love this recipe and it goes really well with cream cheese icing OR with a dollop of whipping cream / cool-whip on top.  I'm using this recipe to make cup-cakes for my child's 1st birthday next week.  At least she will get a bit of veggies in the sweet too!  Happy Baking!",

The amount of chocolate is good and with zucchini in it I can tell myself it's good for me too! I topped it with Perfect Cream Cheese Icing by Crystal R. and that put it at a 5-star rating! Definitely worth making and I will make it again maybe just adding a tad more oil to the mixture or maybe a little more milk.",
