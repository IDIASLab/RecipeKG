Like the reviewer below said, use the large jellyroll size pan (15\"x10\") not a 9x13 or 8x8...it just won't work.\n\nVery very moist and rich. I lost my original recipe about a year ago and have been searching to find one that will work. This one is almost there, but I do add a bit more cocoa. It just didn't have enough chocolate flavor. Otherwise, this recipe is just awesome!\n\nBe sure to pour the icing over the cake right out of the oven. It soaks in and makes a beautiful thin smooth icing on top. ALSO, IF YOU COVER THIS WITH FOIL OR SARANWRAP...be sure to use toothpicks or something to prop up the foil, otherwise it will stick to the icing and you'll have a huge mess. Lesson learned the hard way! :-)",

The recipe doesn't mention pan size that I can see... be sure and use the large jellyroll size pan (15\"x10\") not a 9x13 or it won't cook right. It comes out to be quite a thin cake, it is so sweet you don't want a big thick piece! If you've never made a Texas sheet cake before, you will doubt the odd preparation method and probably be concerned that there is no possibility that it will turn out when you see the runny batter, but don't worry!!",

It was so moist and chocolaty....The only thing I might try different is to throw some mini choc chips in as well just to differ the texture and add more chocolate.

                "reviewBody": "This was very simple to make and turned out quite moist but I wish it would have had a deeper chocolate flavor (the cake itself). Frosting was good; I didn't realize that I was low on powdered sugar and only used about 3 cups instead of 4 which made it plenty sweet enough. I also added some walnuts to the frosting because that is the way I've always had it.",
