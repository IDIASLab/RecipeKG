He doesn't make it too sweet on purpose--because I usually drench the sausage patties with maple syrup anyway--so if you prefer a sweeter variation, you could always add more brown sugar to taste. This seasoning amount is enough for 1 pound of ground pork.",

As written it's a delicious and flavorful breakfast sausage seasoning that would probably go well with a variety of meats. I personally used a combo of turkey and pork for a good in-between of lean and fatty meat. I do not care for overly spicy things either so this seasoning was perfect for me. The sausage tasted great as a side to some blueberry pancakes and scrambled eggs--it complimented everything well. If you want a lot of heat then add your own spice to taste. Real simple to adjust it that way honestly.",

This worked perfectly in ground turkey. I added an 1/8 tsp of spicy Cajun seasoning and a tablespoon of water (per the notes at the bottom of the instructions). I will be using this for making turkey sausage patties in bulk for freezing. Thank you!",
