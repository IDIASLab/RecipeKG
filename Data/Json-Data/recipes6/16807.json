He's from Arkansas, I'm from New York..so needless to say, I had a \"are you kidding me?\" moment. Having nothing to compare the taste to, I was reluctant to make it. But then realized I could go to my favorite website and find one that would come close to what Granny used to make. After reading every single recipe,and all the reviews, this one sounded the best.\nWow, is all I got to say. I have never had this before. Never even bought squash till yesterday. I thought it was totally amazing. Very very tasty. My 5 yr old even liked it. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but didn't use the whole bunch of onions..(What is a bunch anyway? is it the whole bag,and what if my bunch was bigger than one used in this recipe? would I then be using too much?..yea, I was going nutty.So I knocked it down to half, and it came out awesome. Thanks for a wonderful recipe,and for saving Father's day!",

We prefer our squash a little more firm so I only boiled the squash about 8 minutes and it was a perfect texture. I also thought a stick of butter would be too greasy for us so I reduced the butter to 4 tbsp which was plenty. The problem for us was the sugar. It was too sweet for us. Instead of enhancing the flavor it just seemed an odd combination for our taste. It seemed that most people liked the casserole as is but if you prefer a more savory dish like us - I would leave out the sugar.",
