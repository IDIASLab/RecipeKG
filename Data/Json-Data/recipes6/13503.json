Best made with fresh fruit. \r\nI was a little hesitant just spooning the fruit on top of the batter and not having a topping to place over the fruit, but soon realized the topping comes up over the top of the fruit almost encasing it.\r\nI did as another baker did and added a tablespoon of orange juice and sprinkled just a little bit of cinnamon on top of the fruit (peaches & plums) and then sprinkled some brown sugar on top once the fruit was spooned over the batter and it turned out fantastic.\r\nThank you! Excellent recipe.",

I really wanted to use only apples, but I wasn't sure what type would work best, so I used what I had on hand which was only 2 granny smith. I had a lot of fresh plums I recently purchased, so I mixed them with the apples along with a dash of cinnamon, a tablespoon of orange juice, and I don't know why, but a squirt of lemon extract. I spooned over the batter, and sprinkled brown sugar on top. Everyone LOVED it! I will definately make this one again and again!!! Thank you for sharing this receipe.",
