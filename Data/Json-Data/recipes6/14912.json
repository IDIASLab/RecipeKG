The recipe we use is 1:1 soy sauce and sugar (or splenda if you prefer). Grate the ginger and garlic to taste (more garlic than ginger) and add a splash of mirin. Cook until dissolved. We marinate chicken beef and even pork in this sauce and it is wonderful. Sesame seeds are often added as well.",

Initially I followed the recipe to the letter except i used reduced sodium soy sauce and it was still way too salty!
