I will absolutely remember this one as long as I'm able to cook.  I served it with Spinach Enchiladas, available at allrecipes, but it is so versatile that it would work with so many dishes.  I used a full can of veggie broth and the rice could still have been a little more moist.  Don't be afraid to use the jalapeno pepper.  Amazingly, with the pepper, chili powder (I used Mexian chili powder) and cumin, this recipe only offers a little zip.  It's not spicy HOT, like one might expect.  There are so many elements that make this recipe great but the cheese really makes it pop.  Don't leave it out.  It provides just the right finishing touch.  My somewhat picky adult son said this one was amazing!  Victory!",

I added about 1/3 of a cup of salsa to it and to cut the fat content I did not use the cheese. The rice came out very moist and delicious. I also used white rice instead of brown because it was all I had in the house and it still came out great. Great recipe thank you!!",

I used slow cooking brown rice 1 can of Mexican tomatoes and placed browned boneless skinless chicken thighs on top of the rice for the last 20 minutes of cooking then just sprinkled the cheese on top to melt.

I used chicken broth (which MAY have altered the receipe too much) but no matter which broth you use it seems to need just a little more (perhaps an extra 1/4 cup?). Some of my rice was slightly undercooked. Also with the amount of rice vs the red peppers and tomatoes required it just seemed too much...and we LOVE red peppers and tomatoes possibly lessen one ingrediant or omit one altogether? Since I have found better rice side dishes I probally won't make this one again.",
