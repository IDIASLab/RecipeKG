My first (albeit very very small) batch has tiny paper towel pieces stuck to them. 2. Don't use a SMALL saucepan. That's a good way to start your kitchen on fire (I really really didn't burn anything down I promise). Other than that easy recipe delicious snack!! Thanks! UPDATE - I made these on Sunday and they were fabulous. On Tuesday I had a few of the leftovers. Not so fabulous! Be sure to make small batches what you can eat in one or two days. Beyond that not so great! I guess these won't be part of my Christmas gift baskets this year =(",
