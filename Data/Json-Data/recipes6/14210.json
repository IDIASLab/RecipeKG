I used 1/2 pkg of lemon jello in the cranberry sauce to stiffen instead of corn starch... and used OJ instead of water like another reviewer mentioned. Oh, and I didn't add the whipping cream to the cream cheese mixture, but I will next time... think mine was a little too much just like cream cheese... would be a little fluffier with the cool whip or whipping cream.
