It's flavors really intensify over days and it keeps well for about 7-10 days, so do yourself a favor and make this recipe way in advance when you have some spare time.  The recipe creates alot of liquidmarinade, and the liquid seems to increase over the days.   Either expect to drain off alot or cut the liquid in half so that you won't have to drain any off.  I've tried the recipe both ways and have not found any reduction in flavor by initially cutting the liquid in half.  Also, know that if you use purple cabbage, it will soon color the other veggies even though the flavor will remain very nice.  I prefer to use very little purple cabbage and alot of white cabbage, because doing so creates a multi-colored salad, instead of a totally purple one.",

I added the additional onion but skipped the celery because I didn't have any.  I'm going to add poppyseeds to this recipe the next time I made it.  A keeper recipe!\r\n(addendum - the second time I made this recipe I added purple cabbage for color.  Big mistake, it colored all the cabbage purple.  I had a very big bowl of purple slaw.)",
