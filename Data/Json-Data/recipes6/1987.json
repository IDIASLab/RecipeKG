I didn t have some ingredients and I doubled the marinade/sauce because we always like extra sauce for the rice underneath. I didn t measure how much I put on the pork to marinade though just what looked like enough. I also put the garlic and fresh grated ginger (I have a rasp I use on both the garlic and ginger a lot of my Asian recipes call for both) right into the marinade instead of putting them in later. The veggies I had on hand were fresh broccoli carrots green onions and a can of water chestnuts. I usually cook them first and saw that other reviewers suggested it too. I stir fried/steamed the broccoli and carrots but under cooked them so they wouldn t get too done when mixed in at the end. I put them on a plate and drained the pork of the marinade. I stir fried it breaking it up into batches so the wok wasn t over crowded. After it all was done I added back the rest of the pork and marinade and brought it to a boil so I could thicken it with a slurry of cornstarch and water. Once it was thickened I added back the steamed veggies water chestnuts chopped green onions (3). I then drizzled some sesame oil on top and sprinkled sesame seeds on it. Oh I m really not comfortable frying with sesame oil I use it as a finishing oil. I fry in an asian stir fry oil tha",

I added the sauce to the meat while I cut up veggies then made a triple batch of sauce while I was cooking the meal. After the veggies were cooked I removed them to a large bowl & added the extra sauce to the skillet & thickened it with a little corn starch slurry then poured the meat back in. Delicious!",
