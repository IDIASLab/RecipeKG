The second time I added about half a 1/4th cup more brown sugar & I only has small eggs (I have chickens so use what they give me) so I used 2 small eggs and I added about 1/4 cup peanut butter. They turned out wonderfully!!! So this is a verseatile recipe. Definitely a keeper.",

So while these aren't technically low carb because of the sugar, the almond flour cuts it down considerably. We subbed for cannabutter and dark chocolate chips, made them bite-sized and made a batch with just butter and milk chocolate chips for the kids. I don't even miss beer :D May try subbing the brown sugar for some kind of fake sugar but man... I don't know... the brown sugar shines through in these and makes them really taste like a glutinous flour-based chocolate chip cookie.  Kids loved the kid-friendly ones, the youngest (3) couldn't tell the difference and the oldest (15) knew but still said they were good.  For the cannabutter cookies, I dropped the temperature to 325 and cooked them a bit longer to compensate.",

I increased the brown sugar to 1/3 cup, other than that I made them exactly as described in recipe. I will be using this recipe as a base for lots of other cookies! Very good!",

After a few experiments I settled on 1/2 cup swerve instead of the brown sugar and added 2 tsp of molasses to get the brown sugar taste also added 2 tbsp of crunchy almond butter and I used coconut oil instead of butter for a little firmer texture. My family thinks they are awesome. Swerve is primarily erythritol. I also used sugar free chocolate chips.",
