I used my crockpot and just loaded it full of sliced apples ( I think I used 8-10), peels on, mixed in the other ingredients and then added about 1/4 cup of apple cider in place of the milk.  I figured the 1/2 cup might be too much!  I put it on high and in a few hours I had a fantastic dessert that the whole family loved!  We ate it warm with some cool whip on top, since I didn't have any ice cream!  I will make this again!",
