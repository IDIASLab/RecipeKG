Hubby cannot eat grapefruit so I made the salsa with Cara Cara oranges which was perfect. (blood oranges would be great). I lined a sheet pan with parchment paper and placed the fish on one side and asparagus on the other end. I did change the cooking time and temperature to 400 degrees convection setting for 10 minutes. Both the fish and the asparagus were done at the same time. Fast easy delicious and healthy too. Served on a bed of rice with a spinach salad side. Even the fish hating hubby like this.",

It was very fresh it cooked perfectly at 20 minutes and although the salmon itself wasn't all that flavorful the rub really kicked it up a notch. For our tastes we could have used a little more jalape\u00f1o in the salsa but we enjoyed the pop of citrus flavor that came with the grapefruit.",

                "reviewBody": "I actually really liked the salmon on this with the rub. Based on reading the other reviews and about the heat with the rub I only did a pinch of cayenne. I just don't care for hot food. It seemed like a lot of seasoning but it was a nice amount after it was baked. I also made sure to do a packed but leveled amount of brown sugar so it wasn't too sweet either. I lined a baking sheet with heavy duty foil sprayed it with PAM well and baked it on that. I didn't precisely measure the corn oil. I just drizzled it. I liked the mild taste of the corn oil compared to others I typically use. I think the extra amount may have given it a nice crispiness. I have never baked salmon in the regular oven and really liked the ease of this method. I usually use a broiler or saut\u00e9 pan. I kept it in for 30 minutes and it seemed like a good amount of time. 1 lb is really not a lot of salmon. I got 4 really small pieces. So I would make more next time. I used skin on salmon but might try the skinned kind next time. The salsa I was really not excited about. I made 1/2 recipe of it and it was plenty. It makes an interesting combination when a bite of it is eaten with the salsa. Grape fruit has also really gotten sweeter from what I remember as a kid. I bought what my local grocery store had called cocktail grapefruit. I made sure to cut off all of the outer peel the white pith and seeds before chopping to help with bitterness. I am rating this a 4 as I plan to make the salmon again. ty",

Just make it as written unless you are a little iffy about the heat from the cayenne---then start with just half that amount and see what you think. The salsa would be really good if it had some kind of liquid in it---olive oil lemon or lime juice---anything. It just needed something. I had to use something other than grapefruit because of my husband's meds so I chose to use an orange that came from a friend's tree. That worked well. You could easily get by with 1/4 of the salsa for this amount of fish. I have leftover salsa so I'll add something to that and make this same dish again this week. It's that good. Thanks Mazola!",

Hubby liked it he said he would give it 4 stars would have been 5 if it had instructed to remove the skin. One daughter liked the fish but not the salsa the other liked the salsa but not the fish. My son took one look at it and refused to even taste it and I didn't care for it at all. In fairness I'm not much of a salmon fan. The rub and salsa would probably be great on chicken. I won't make the salmon again but might try the rest with chicken sometime especially since there was so much salsa left over.",
