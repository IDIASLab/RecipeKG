Also the directions call it coriander paste - where is the coriander in the ingredients??6/7/04-I made this recipe again last night and pleased to see recipe was corrected based on my input. This time I used boneless chicken breasts and they were fantasic. Also instead of fish sauce - I use soy sauce. Thank you again for a 10 recipe.",

I was a little concerned about an overwhelming cilantro flavor but that was NOT a problem. We couldn't find \"red hot chile peppers\" so I used one \"hot cherry pepper\" (small red shaped like a habanero). They aren't too hot but have a great flavor. Used 3 b/s chicken breasts and grilled over high heat for a total of about 20 minutes; we kind of burned it but wow it was still really really good! Just a tiny amount of heat. My husband suggested roasting the peppers next time which would really increase the intensity of the peppers. Also we used powdered coconut milk which is REALLY convenient and tasted just a good as freshly made or canned.",
