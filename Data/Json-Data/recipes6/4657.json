I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Additionally I had to add a little olive oil with the kale and spices in order to saute them since the pan became dry.

Plus kale and lentils can be hard to digest without an ingredient such as garlic. I should add though that I did modify the recipe as I do for all recipes and did not add curry powder.
