The key to the eggs and getting them thick is to seperate the eggs. Beat the egg yolks and half of the sugar (meant for the eggs) and they get thick and creamy. Then do the same with the egg whites and the rest of the sugar. When you add the sugar for both, do it very slowly as you are whipping. Once the yolks are thick and creamy and the whites are at soft peaks, combine both of them and then add to the chocolate mixture. Also, the longer it cooks the better. I hope this helps. I also served it with fresh whipped cream just do break the richness. Enjoy!!!",

My eggs never get thick and it's OK! Some people separate and whip up the eggs; I find that that gives air to the cake that makes it less like decadence and more like a mousse. Decadence is a dense, rich concoction. You want to whip the eggs to make sure they are uniform (without distinguishable whites or yolks), and you want to fold them in so as to not incorporate more air than absolutely necessary.  Also, for those of you who find there's too much -- you're probably using a 9\" pan; this recipe calls for a 10\" pan. In a 10\" pan the batter never even reaches half way up. ",

They all will be gooey and dense without the flour - however this one has that touch of texture similar to a brownie on top not quite crunchy - but a perfect combination with the softer center. I very much prefer to use all bittersweet chocolate - which translates to roughly 1 1/2 bags of the Gharadelli. Great quality chocolate for what's available at most grocery stores and it elevates it truly to restaurant quality dessert. I make either a blackberry or marionberry sauce to pool on the plate. Top with a thin sliver of the cake that is slightly warmed and a dollop of sweetened real whipped cream. Amazing!",

Super-rich, without being leaden, it has a nice slightly crunchy layer on top with a moist and chewy melt-in-your-mouth center. Use good chocolate and it will be even better.\n\nI followed the advice of someone who suggested separating the eggs and beating 1/2 of the egg sugar into the whites and yolks before combining them. I think that really helps the texture. \n\nThe batter more than filled the 9.5\" pie pan I had, so I put the rest in 3\" ramekins for individual servings. I baked it all in a water bath at 350. The ramekins were done in about 40 min, the big cake took another 10 min. I baked until there was just a little sticking to a toothpick. \n\nServe with fresh whipped cream (that ingredient does not get added to the batter...), and maybe a drizzle of homemade chocolate and/or raspberry sauce. \n\nAbsolutely, ridiculously good.",

It got rave reviews from the crowd though it was mostly because it was like a pan of chocolate goo. I left it in as per the directions and even cooked it in a slightly larger square pan - and it still didn't completely set as a cake. I'm not sure if that's because I didn't beat the eggs long enough or if I needed to cook it longer or if it's just supposed to be that consistency. It was kind of like the middle of a really fudgy undercooked brownie - but the top had a crunch layer. Personally - I thought it was AWESOME as I love undercooked brownies cookies and raw doughs and batters. But if I were making it for a crowd again I would cook a bit longer.",
