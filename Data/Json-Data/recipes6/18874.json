Use egg yolks instead of whole eggs if you want it slightly richer (although this recipe is almost perfect as is).  Even after hardening in the freezer it was still relatively easy to scoop...The reason is that fats (inc. egg yolks) and sugar don't freeze, so don't back off too much on the sugar (or cream) if you plan on freezing it to serve later.

A few things I learned that might help you: - I doubled the recipe and forgot to take into account that it would take longer than the recipe instructions for the mixtures to heat on the stove. I stirred constantly and waited patiently and it paid off but it did take a long time. - I also failed to consider that for my ice cream maker at least the mixture needs to cool before churning. Since it was coming hot off the stove I had to let it cool on the stove then in the fridge for a while which added about 45 minutes to my planned cooking time. I hate taking a long time to cook but I'm not kidding you every minute was worth it. It was delicious and received rave reviews from our dinner guests. I served it solo and think to have served it with anything would take away from how good it was!",
