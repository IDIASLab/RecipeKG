Our favorite frosting is to take another cup or so of the choclate chips add about a tablespoon of crisco heat to melting point in microwave stir well.... then drizzle over the top and sides of the cake. PS: when adding the chips to the cake (not the frosting) you MAY want to add them AFTER you have poured the batter into the pan. Basically just sprinkle them on top and stir them only slightly into the batter. This way they may not settle as much toward the bottom. To me this cake tastes even better after it has been around for a day.",

You can halve proportions and bake in an 8x8 inch square pan. If you want to speed up baking time you can bake at 350 instead of 325 and start checking the center for done-ness at around 45 minutes. You can double the amount of cocoa and also increase the apples. I used all whole-wheat flour instead of white flour. I also substituted buttermilk for half the butter and the finished product was still extremely moist and delicious. The acidity in the buttermilk reacts with the baking soda so the flavor will not be sour and the reaction will also lighten the cake somewhat.",
