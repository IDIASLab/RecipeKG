                "reviewBody": "Needed a break from all the thick heavy holiday foods. This recipe was amazingly refreshing as soon as I sipped it I knew I was breaking all the wintertime rules with this one. Definitely a keeper I am so glad I took a chance and tried it since it didn't have a rating yet. Quick simple easy and refreshing. You can probably add what ever fruits you want to tweak it make it your own and it will likely still yield great results. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except I don't have ginger juice in my grocery store nor have I ever heard of it so I substituted 1tbs of ginger juice for 2tbs ginger ale. I got my drink recipes mixed up so by mistake I added 3tbs of confectioners sugar along with the 1tbs of brown sugar the recipe calls for. I don't know how it would have tasted without the extra confectioners sugar but to me it had just the right amount of sweetness so that it wasn't overly sweet just exotic and refreshingly sweet. We are non-alcohol friendly so my husband kids and I were all extremely happy with the results. My mango was big and sweet I used Voss sparkling water and just regular minute maid orange juice rather than fresh squeezed. When I make it again I am going to probably double the lime juice as it was overshadowed by the orange & mango flavors. Cheers to great drinking.",
