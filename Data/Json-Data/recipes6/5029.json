It worked great and there is no taste to arrowroot. It does make a large batch so just a warning you probably not be able to eat all of it at one sitting. You could also use cornstarch or flour for a thickening but I would recommend the cornstarch over the flour. Actually arrowroot is best because it is tasteless.",

I omitted the spinach just because I forgot to add it in at the end. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it came out great. It did take me about 35 minutes to put it all together.

Also the chili was a little more liquid-y than I'm used to and I even drained/rinsed the cans of beans. I would put the spinach in at the end next time because I did not like the texture of soggy spinach. But overall good with some sour cream to tamper the chipotle!",
