I would omit the cider vinegar. I feel cheated wasting my 16 worth of handpicked wild huckleberries from the farmer's market on this. Huckleberries are a rare treat with a unique flavor that deserve to stand alone not be compromised with the taste of vinegar of all things! I thought maybe it was my pregnancy hormones making me more sensitive but when my husband started sniffing the pie I asked him why and he said \"Why does it smell like vinegar?\" And NO I did not add any more than the recipe called for. It was also a bit runny at slightly warm temperature where you want to serve so it could use some more tapioca or other thickener. I tried this with a cream cheese crust which was delicious. I know people use lemon juice in this type of pie so that might be a better alternative to the vinegar but probably better to just leave it out.",

The vinegar was very strong when the pie first cooled but not too bad this morning. I still don't think it needs it or maybe just a touch of lemon juice. These berries are not sweet to begin with. I also used minute tapioca which I think worked fine. I didn't think to brush my crust with cream or egg and wish it would have been suggested in the recipe. I didn't need to cover crust to keep from overbrowning which I did and it's pale. It's okay alone better with ice cream.",

This year we picked 75 quarts of huckleberries and so I canned them in quart bottles. This was a great recipe but because I used bottled huckleberries there was a lot of liquid. I drained the liquid off and thickened it with 3 T of cornstarch cooled and then added back in the berries and added tapioca flour which I made by blending whole tapiocca. Let that sit while making the crust. The berries were bottled with a light syrup so I decreased the sugar to 1/2 c. and put in lemon juice instead of vinegar. I also didn't add in the butter. Cinnamon always enhances huckleberries so I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top of the crust. This will be my stand-by from now on!",
