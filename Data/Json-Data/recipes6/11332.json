I chose this recipe rather than some of the others because it had a lower sugar content than most of the persimmon desserts I saw. It did rise but it'ts a small amount of batter for the size of pan suggested so it was low but pretty. (see picture) I may try without the spices to see if I taste the persimmon more. Thanks Kiana!",
