Just finished dinner and paired these with Tangy Grilled Pork Tenderloin from this site and oh my goodness what a meal. Served with oven roasted potatoes and onions and it was honestly one of the best meals we've ever had at home or out. I followed this exactly as written and used a bag of really teeny baby carrots (you know--now our grocery has baby carrots and then REALLY tiny baby carrots). Didn't change a darn thing from the recipe and they were perfectly delicious. Sprinkled just a tad bit of thyme over them as a little garnish and they were simply awesome.
