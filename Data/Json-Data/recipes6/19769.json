The shortbread was very tough and the finished brownies were impossible to slice without falling apart.  The flavor is just so-so.  I feel bad admitting that I think these were kind of a waste of the ingredients that I don't usually keep on hand (used up my walnuts and condensed milk)... I'm almost embarassed to bring them to work, except that I know any treat will be considered a good treat at work.  I sent a bunch to work with my husband, too.  I will update later if there are positive comments from our co-workers, but overall I do not think I'll even attempt to make these again- don't even care to try and fix whatever went wrong.  Sorry.. it was fun to try something new, though!",

The shortbread crust doesn't have much flavor to it (I would add ground almonds or pecans to it for more flavor and a nutty crunch) and the \"brownie\" layer really doesn't taste like brownies at all. I think it's the sweetened condensed milk that makes them taste kind of strange. Rather than using that recipe I would just layer my favorite prepared brownie mix (with chocolate bar pieces and nuts mixed in) over the top of the modified crust and bake it. I think it's a good idea but this recipe just didn't \"hit the spot\" for me.",

It hardened up so that I could cut it but it still isn't what I would call a brownie. That being said it tastes very good. My kids absolutely love it and probably would have eaten the pan had I not stopped them. Don't know if I'll try again or not.",
