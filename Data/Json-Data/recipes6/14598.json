The best compliment i can give you is when I ate these buns I felt like i was getting a hug from my grandma. I used a spice cake mix instead of vanilla and they turned out sweet and soft and delicious and they were so easy to make.  Thank you for giving me that moment.  I can't wait to make them for my grandpa.  If you want to try them grams way  spread the butter on and add the brown sugar and cinnamon generously.  roll them up and cut like normal.  Place them in a 9x13 baking dish and top each bun with a little more cinnamon and brown sugar then pour enough corn syrup just to cover the tops of each bun.bake according to this recipe.  This makes a delicious sticky bun.",
