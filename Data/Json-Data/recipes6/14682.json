The result: my friend held two cookies in each hand literally SHOVING them in his mouth because they all got eaten in five minutes; there was a mad rush to get them and needless to say I brought none back home. Only problem with the recipe I can see is that the dough is very sticky and hard to form in balls. My suggestion is to drop the dough directly into the sugar and then form the balls as the sugar coats the dough and allows you to roll it. Also, I used a tablespoon of orange juice instead of water to bring out the ginger flavor and it worked extremely well.",

I made mine smaller, rolling the dough into about 3/4 inch balls. They came out the size of a ginger snap. I made the first batch to give as a gift, but they disappeared before I could give them away. Now I have to make another batch tonight. Thank you for a recipe I'll use for years to come. \n\n*edit*\nOn the second batch I took the advice of another reviewer and used orange juice instead of water. I didn't think it would make that much of a difference, but the subtle change MADE these cookies. My boyfriend considers himself a cookie connoisseur (and a picky one to boot) and he says these are the best cookies he's ever eaten - bar none.",

It makes a HUGE difference.  I baked mine for 10 minutes - they still stayed moist.  I am planning to give these cookies as gifts for Christmas.  Thanks for the great recipe!\n\n**Unfortunately, these cookies didn't last long enough to give away as gifts.  So I made another batch - this time I used fresh grated ginger, and instead of water for the liquid, I used Brandy-Orange Liqueur.  What a difference!  A nice taste for the holidays.  Next time, I'll try Grand Marnier, Cointreau, Spiced Rum, etc....the possibilities are endless!  Thanks again for the great recipe!",

I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of margarine to get the buttery taste.  Instead of water, I followed other reviewers' advice and used fresh orange juice.  However, I'm not sure the juice made any difference.  Before measuring the molasses, I sprayed the measuring cup with cooking spray so the molasses would slide out easily.  I rolled the dough into 1-inch balls to yield more cookies.  I will definitely use this recipe again very soon.",
