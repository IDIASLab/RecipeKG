I really think the whole thing that makes this cookie so yummy is the TART CHERRY so definitely stick with that- otherwise it's really a whole new recipe, not just a tweak. They really are delicious and the tartness of the dried cherry is nice departure from the usual sweet raisins in oatmeal cookies. If you want to make it special try dipping half in melted semisweet CHOCOLATE and letting cool on parchment paper, adding mini choc chips to the batter, or drizzling with chocolate(milk, white or dark)- all pretty simple if you melt it in the microwave. Those are things I do when I am making as gifts but I enjoy them as is myself.\nAlso for the people with flat cookies who used BUTTER- just wondering if anyone tried COOLING the dough in the fridge for a bit before scooping and baking- that tends to prevent that sort of thing. I guess then you might want to shape them a bit since they won't spread quite as much themselves when baking.",
