Used rotisserie chicken to makes things even simpler. For my wing sauce I used Louisiana original wing sauce which is pretty hot and then for the second pizza used Louisiana honey mustard not quite as hot. The blue cheese and mozzarella does give some nice creamy calm to the hot spice and I was glad I had a thick crust too;-). This really would make a great dish to take to football parties. My boys said to make this again on Monday night Football...Thanks Saveur for another great recipe.",

My buffalo wing sauce was extremely hot and since I was also feeding the little guy (who does like spicy foods) I mixed some w/ some ranch dressing and used that as the base sauce which worked out really well.

One of us preferred the drier version and one preferred it as written but we both thoroughly enjoyed it:) Thanks for recommending this I used a thin crispy crust and put it on an indirect grill for about 20 minutes (very windy and had a hard time even getting the grill 400).",

I'm not a fan of the blue cheese but even I tolerated it in the leftover scraps I was able to rummage up. 12 minutes of baking time kept the celery nice and crisp which added a whole other texture element that suited the dish perfectly.This pizza is spicy spicy (as a buffalo pizza should be) so if you are sensitive to heat you might want to cut back a little or thin it down with ranch dressing. LOVED it Saveur and cannot wait to try it again. The recipe title couldn't be more perfect for this is the ultimate football food!",

I used canned chicken and let that soak in hot sauce for about an hour and also added diced red onions to the toppings. I baked the store pizza crust alone for about half the time so the sauce would not make the crust mushy. After cooking in the oven I always broil my pizza for a minute or two to fully brown the cheese on top a little. This was a crowd-pleaser for my family that enjoys the spicier foods. Looking forward to trying with some BBq sauce instead of hot sauce for a lighter spice.",
