I usually make a regular fruit salad and it's in the 'fridge for days. Last night I made this one and it was gone within hours. A great fruit salad. Only thing I didn't like was the strong smell of vinegar when heating it up in the saucepan -- it stinks. But I figure I can make a LOT of the chilled mixture and use it for later which I do like. Edited: After making it several times I just thought I'd add more to this review. I'm not much of a cook so I don't see why the vinegar is necessary probably flavor(?) but to compensate for the terrible smell of it I use half the vinegar. Still tastes great. In fact I add more pineapple as well. I also wanted to mention that the salad tastes MUCH better if left in the 'fridge for a day or two when the mixture pineapple juice and whipped topping blends together into the apples. This way the peanuts soak up the juice as well and are not as crunchy and hard on the teeth but enough to still add texture and flavor to the salad.",

I make it with all granny smith apples to get a contrasting tartness to the sweetness and good unsalted peanuts are hard to come by so I go ahead and use salted and it comes out really good anyway. Also I use about double the pineapple and extra creamy cool whip... Made it again today and had to sub corn starch for the tapioca. Used about half as much corn starch as it called for. The dressing looked and tasted kind of pasty until I added a tsp of butter. Then it cooked to the right consistency and became more transparent and the pasty flavor went away.:)",
