Thank you for a wonderful recipe! I will definitely be making this again soon!! FYI: I needed to use a little more than a cup of water for the mixture to form a dough.

Added two eggs and enough water to moisten into a bread batter. Greased and floured a bread pan and baked at 350 for 60 minutes. Final thoughts: Might consider using half of the baking powder (1/2 teaspoon) and adding a (1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. Will probably use milk in place of water (1 cup or more). This will probably bring more moisture to the bread. Never made flat bread before. maybe I didn't make it right.",
