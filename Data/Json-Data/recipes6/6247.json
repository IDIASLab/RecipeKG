The only thing we change is to add chili to the hotdogs (can chili works just fine). The bacon really adds a nice flavor to the hotdog. For someone like me this is important. I hate the taste of most hotdog sausage meats even the all beef brands. So the bacon actually enhances the often unappetizing taste and adds a nice smoky flavor.",

I just tossed the bacon and onion in a fry pan for a few minutes with the hot dogs. I assembled the buns cheese hotdogs onion bacon and bbq sauce then I broiled them for just about 2-3 minutes on high with an extra 1/2 slice of cheese on top. The kids and hubby loved them and polished them off! Frying up the onion with the bacon really helped take the bite off so the kids could enjoy it too. The bbq sauce was something fun and out of the ordinary than ketchup. Even in on cold winter days you can still enjoy this food if you just prepare it with a little imagination.",
