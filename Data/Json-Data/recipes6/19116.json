I've made this many times and find that using cocoa gave the cake a grittier, more brownie-like texture. So I now use 2 full bars of Ghiradelli Bittersweet Chocolate (8 oz. total) and skip the cocoa powder completely (ADD 8-10 min. cooking time). I still use the same amount of sugar. Using ALL chocolate bars gives this a silkier texutre not to mention a stronger chocolate flavor. 4 stars as written, 5+ stars for slight alteration.  Serve with fresh sliced strawberries or raspberries and a dusting of powdered sugar for a dessert made for company.",

The other guest went crazy for it as well.  I don't have a double boiler, so I just melted the butter over low heat in a saucepan, and then added the chocolate.  I divided the batter into 3 4\" springform pans (although, I think I might use 4 next time; each serving was really huge), using pam and cocoa powder on them before putting the batter in.  They popped right out after they had cooled.  I turned them upside-down to get a flat surface and then drizzled chocolate ganache over them and topped with piped whipped cream and fresh quartered strawberries.  It looked very elegant and tasted just as good.",
