Once the sugar and syrup boiled for about one minute, I added vanilla and pb and it turned out perfectly.",

Over cooking leads to rock hard cookies! I added another cup of cereal to get a better consistency and some small semi sweet chocolate chips (about a cup). For cook timing, I used my 700W microwave and only cooked the mixture for 2 minutes. Keep in mind that if you can do this quickly the mixture won't be too hard to stir together and much easier to spoon out onto your wax paper.",
