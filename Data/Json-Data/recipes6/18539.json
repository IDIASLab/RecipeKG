I add additional onion to help balance the amount of sugar in this recipe. Also I added a little yellow coloring to make it reminiscent of the restaurant dressing. It can be made with prepared mustard as well. For those on sugar/carb restriction it can also be made with that famous blue sugar substitute as well though you will find you need to increase the amount of the sweetener. Enjoy!",

It's very sweet, with a nice vinegar tang, and the author is correct, it's surprisingly universally liked.  I do grate the onion instead of finely dice (which is a pain, but results in a nice smooth texture) but other than that, no changes. :-) __Update!__ Also, the flavors become SO much more complex if you let the dressing sit for several hours before serving.  It's phenomenal with spinach, bacon and fresh sliced strawberries.",

I thought the amount of sugar was way to much. I scaled it down to 4 since I didn't need very much and it was still way to sweet. The other ingredients really didn't give it a lot of flavor but it did thicken up nicely as it was blending. Unfortunately that's about the only thing I enjoyed about this recipe. Sorry but this just wasn't my cup of tea. Thanks anyway.",
