Because I have them available now in my garden I chose to use a handful of chopped fresh herbs to replace the dried - oregano thyme rosemary basil sage and parsley. I found this recipe to have unusual ingredient measurements and it might have been better to have published the recipe with measurements for standard 1 1-1/2 or 2 pound loaves. As another reviewer suggested I scaled the recipe to 17 servings to make my 1-1/2 pound loaf. The amount of salt called for then was 1-3/4 tsp. and I found it to be too much. The bread didn't rise as well as it should have and the finished bread even tasted too salty. Next time I will cut back the salt to 1-1/2 tsp. for the recipe scaled to use 3 cups flour.",
