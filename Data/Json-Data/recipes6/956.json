This is a lovely, moist pumpkin raisin bread. I use Better Batter&reg; Gluten-Free all-purpose flour. I measure by weight and that has made all the difference! I refuse to use bean flour mixes; who wants bean flavor in their sweets? Let it cool completely or it will not hold together. Once it is cooled you can slice and serve. Enjoy!",
