I am using 24 ounce jars of sweet cherries though so when making the sauce I use a little more sugar and corn starch - and it turns out to about close to 3 cups of sauce with a lot of cherries. (I ve just used the extra for waffle topping) My husband generally will not eat anything with cherries but this cake smells so good when baking that he tried and loves this cake. He won t use the sauce yet though. It s really good with a little vanilla ice cream on top too.",
