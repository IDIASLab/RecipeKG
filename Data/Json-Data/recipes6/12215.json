The key with these cookies is that YOU SHOULD NOT BROWN THEM.  If they turn golden on top, they're overdone.  When you just start to see a teeny bit of golden color at the base of the cookies, get them out of the oven!  Almond, anise, vanilla, lemon...all  varieties taste great.",

I've been using an old recipe for years and it somehow just changed over time and the cookies were just boring. This is great. Very nice texture not too cakey not too dry. Wonderful understated flavor - just great... I made up a batch for this Easter sunday and made different colors for the icing. They look like a bunch of beautiful Easter eggs. DELICIOUS... Thanks for this recipe. Also makes several dozen if you don't make them too big. Nice... I changed the baking powder amount to 1 tablespoon.",

Two things though--everyone else is right about the baking powder. I put in 2TB and think that I may put even less next time (hence why only 4 stars). The texture is cakelike and the taste is less sweet and is almost between a biscuit and a cookie. These were DEVOURED at my sister's bridal shower today. Also I wasn't sure that kids would like them because they're less sweet but I had to stop my nephew when I saw him hit about the dozen mark and package the rest up for him to eat later at home!!",
