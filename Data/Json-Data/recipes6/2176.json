Spice rub marinade, lightly breaded with a maple-mustard glaze, and cooked in garlic-flavored oil - a great Canadian recipe! This is also great on the BBQ. Perfect with roasted potatoes and a coleslaw.",

My chops were 3/4 inch thick and I only cooked them for 3 minutes on high for each side and then 1 minute per side with the glaze. I checked to see what the temp was inside and they were perfect. Very juicy and the flavor was excellent! Thanks for sharing. I will do these again and not change anything.",

Brined in 2 gallons of water with one quarter cup of kosher salt and sugar for four hours. Doubled everything else in the recipe.Patted chop dry and scored. Rubbed in doubled spice mix, put in gallon freezer bag and in fridge over night. Next day dredged in flour, egg wash and bread crumbs. Put half inch of oil in fry pan and fried in oil 2 mins a side just to brown and than on rack on sheet pan to bake as my pork chops were almost 1 and half inch thick COSTCO. When all chops were browned I poured half the doubled sauce mix on top.Baked in 325 oven for 30 mins. served rest of warmed sauce with finished product. be prepared for the accolades.",
