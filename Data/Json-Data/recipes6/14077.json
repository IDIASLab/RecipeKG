I attached a wooden spoon to each of my jars. Approximate cost per jar including fabric ribbon and wooden spoon: 4",

First I used unbleached flour (more of an off-white) and dark brown sugar for more color contrast. I packed the ingredients in this order: 1) flour baking powder salt 2) dark brown sugar 3) white sugar 4) oats 5) chocolate chips (or M&M's the regular or mini ones). I took the advice and used a paper funnel to help pour some of the ingredients into the jar and used an ice cream scoop to pack them down. To pack: using a wide-mouth canning jar put the flour mixture & tap down the jar on a hard surface (e.g. carpeted floor). The flour packs down nicely to about the 300 ml line. Next I packed the brown sugar in to 400 ml. The white sugar taps down to to around 600 ml. Add the oats to around 800ml or less & you're set with the chips! I haven't figured out how to squeeze in an extra cup of nuts.",
