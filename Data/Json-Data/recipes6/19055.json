I made them into cupcakes and baked them for 13 minutes. So delicious moist and fluffy. I added the 1/2 cup of macapuno to the frosting (and used condensed milk instead of evaporated milk) and it was great (although very very sweet). I also didn't add color to the frosting because white was a nice contrast. I also had to double the food coloring in the cake batter because it wasn't purple enough (was grayish). This cake was a lot of work but well worth it I LOVE it!:)",

I used about 3 tsp of each red and blue. I also mixed the ingredients slightly different I added the salt into the egg whites to make them stiff and fluffy. I did not add anything else to the egg whites and added the rest to the batter. I also beat the batter as minimal as possible just enough to get everything incorporated since this seemed to make the cake dry. I also decided to make cupcakes because I wanted small portions this made 24 cupcakes exactly and took 20 minutes to cook. I topped with a coconut cream cheese frosting and shredded coconut. I took them to work and set them in the break room they were gone by lunch and went over well:) People seemed to like the exotic food!",
