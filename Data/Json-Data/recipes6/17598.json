I didn't like it and wasn't even about to attempt to fold in the blueberries with it like that.  I grabbed the milk from the fridge and just poured as I mixed it in, not measuring, until it looked like a nice, fluffy cake batter - I don't know, maybe 2/3 to 3/4 cup or so.  I skipped the step of coating the blueberries with the flour, and just added that 1/4 cup of flour right away to the batter.  I always found that step of dubious value anyway.  The end result with the cake was terrific - but in my mind, only because I added the milk (or buttermilk, or sour cream, or whipping cream, or extra eggs) that it needed.",

I made it according to the directions except I baked it in a bundt pan.  I will make one change next time:  Before adding the blueberries, I will spoon some of the \"plain\" batter into the bottom of the pan.

We also baked it in a 9x12 inch pan as I don't have a ring pan.  I can't recall how long it baked on that temp but I think it was around 40-50 minutes.  Awesome cake and will be making it again!",
