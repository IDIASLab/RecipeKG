The candy tastes just like the fairy food that I remember from my childhood. I added the baking soda at exactly 300 degrees and only stirred three or four times (once the baking soda was added) before pouring into a 9 x 13 pan lined with non-stick foil. The candy set up rather quickly and popped right out of the foil. I did dip the candy into high-quality chocolate that I melted in a double boiler with just a teaspoon of shortening added. I will definitely make this candy again.",

Everything was going along nicely I dumped the baking soda in at 300 stirred and turned to pour into the dish and I noticed a funny smell. The candy was orange and then it hit me I BURNED IT! Ugh. I really wanted to try this and I just happened to have some corn syrup at home. Now I have a disgusting mess and an awful smell. I give 3 stars because I burned it (not the recipe's fault) and because the instructions weren't clear enough for me. I'll try again after I get more corn syrup at the store and hopefully I can give more stars. Update:( Very unhappy now I made a trip to the store and bought more corn syrup after the first batch failed. I made a couple of adjustments to see if I could do this right. I heated the sugar to about 270 and removed it from the heat and stirred in the sifted baking soda. Closer to what I think it is supposed to be the stench has lifted in my house but again IT BURNED! I'm getting grumpy about this one. UPDATE Third time must be the charm. Removed it from the heat at 260 added in the baking soda. Stirred really well and dumped into the dish. Still kinda orange but since it tasted just fine I assume that's the way it's supposed to be. Thanks!",

I think 1.5 TBSP. makes it taste \"off\". Also I used a 9x13x2\" Pyrex dish and the foam was about 4\" high! The air bubbles were so large that it totally crumbled when I cut into it. There was no way this would ever be able to be dipped in chocolate. Be sure to watch the candy thermometer very carefully as it seems to rapidly increase in temperature at 300. Mine got the tiniest bit too done and tasted burned; so on top of the soda taste was just awful. Not sure what to do with this mess. But do try reducing the baking soda if you try making this recipe!",

We made it the first time when we were kids and our parents weren't home.... freaked us out (we couldn't figure out at first why you needed a large pot). We just spead it out on a big cookie sheet and then broke it up. The less baking soda the better. When I moved down to Alabama I tried making the exact same recipe (it was one of my favorites) about 5 times before realizing that the humidity was screwing it up. So the people who posted the negative reviews might take that into consideration. Edit: I was able to make it work in high humidity!!! It was even raining the entire day I made it.... here's how I did it: Make the fairy food pour it in the pan and immediately refrigerate. As soon as it's set(about 30 min?) take it out break it up and dip it in chocolate then immediately put it in freezer in air tight container. Doesn't take long to thaw it so take it out of the freezer about 20 minutes before you serve it. Worked for me!!",
