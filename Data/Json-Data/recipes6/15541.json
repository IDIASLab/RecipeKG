Mix the butter (make sure it is at room temperature) with the sugar (I just use 3/4 cup),\r\n3. Beat the egg with vanilla (yes, I add 1 tsp. of vanilla)\r\n4. Add the beaten egg to the sugar/butter mixture.  \r\n5. Add the sour cream with baking soda and mix until smooth and creamy.\r\n6. Mix well the dry ingredients and then add them to the wet mixture, just to get everything together, do not over mix.\r\n\r\nFrom here, you can add as many \"toppings\" as you want.  This are tried and tested:\r\nChocolate chips\r\nCraisins, raisings, cherries, etc.\r\nDried fruits such as apricots, figs or prunes (chopped in little pieces)\r\nNuts (chopped in little pieces)\r\n\r\nI make 16 balls and press them w/ my hands to make a flat circle. Bake for 15 min. \r\nThe secret with these scones is to not over mix or over handle.",

I wanted to make them ahead of time so I used a 3\" cookie cutter to cut them and froze them uncooked on a cookie sheet covered with wax paper. About an hour later I packaged them into ziplock bags separated by wax paper. For fresh scones anytime, put the desired amount of frozen scones (which look an awful lot like a hockey puck) on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 45 minutes. I added lemon zest and poppy seeds to one recipe, dried cranberries to another and left one plain. I now keep them in my freezer year-round so I can have fresh scones whenever I want. Don't freeze for more that 2-3 months but they probably won't last that long.",

Regular butter creates a crumblier scone, and organic unsalted makes it more cake-like, like a Starbucks scone.  I prefer it that way.  My favorite flavors so far are Orange Spice (orange extract, grated orange rind, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and ginger), and lemon currant (lemon extract, lemon rind, currants).  My husband's favorite is regular chocolate chip.  I always break the batter in half and make 2 different flavors.  Then I divide each flavor into half and make 2 rounds.  If I only do 1 round per flavor, the scones are very large (Starbucks size). I prefer them smaller, so I don't eat so much at each sitting!!  They are PERFECT with hot tea.  I like the orange spice with lady grey, and lemon currant with green tea.  OH!  I also glaze the scones with a glaze made of orange or lemon extract and powdered sugar.  So yummy and so pretty!",

I have added 1/2 c dried cranberries and 1/4 orange juice to it for orange/cranberry scones, top them with a glaze of orange zest, orange juice and confectioner's sugar and you will just die of decadence. Add some pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger, glaze it with a simple confectioner's sugar and you've got a  wonderful holiday (or any day) treat. Add some bacon, onion and cheese, lessen the amount of sugar and you've got a super breakfast! I have made these in huge batches and put them in the freezer for easy microwaveable breakfasts. Add some black berry's and lemon zest and there's another elegant brunch item. what a great versatile, delicious recipe! This is a permanent fixture in my recipe box! Thanks Grandma Johnson!",

I added 1 tsp cinnamon 1/4 tsp ginger 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and a pinch of cloves to the flour mixture and then followed the directions.

I split the dough in half and made plain with sugar sprinkled on top and then tried to make the other half blueberry. I was not very successful with the blueberry half.  But it was my own fault. I had let the frozen blueberries sit on the counter for just a few minutes and they started to thaw so they were getting juicy and then I went to mix them in and it was a huge mess. But the plain with just sugar on top were fabulous so I will be using this recipe and doing all kinds of experiments in the future, starting with the blueberries. Great recipe!!! UPDATE: I have since made this recipe a couple more times and have used fresh blueberries in one batch and mini chocolate chips in another. Both turned out great. 2ND UPDATE: I made these scones again this morning and this time I used blackberries and sprinkled raw sugar (demerara sugar) on top of them and oh my gosh... this is by far my favorite combo. I love blackberries and the crunch of the larger sugar granules on top is really awesome!!!",
