Seriously, try them, they're delicious! I use an inexpensive mini waffle maker (such as Dash&reg; Mini Maker Waffle) which produces perfect 4-inch chaffles. So many ways to use chaffles, the sky's the limit!",

I found that otherwise the chaffles are quite greasy. I was in the mood for a treat this morning, so I added vanilla to these and then had a little bit of real maple syrup over top. Absolutely excellent. I will be adding the almond flour and the baking powder to savoury chaffles as well. For the savoury ones, I like adding spices into the mix, like onion and garlic powder or even curry powder. TIP:  I make my own almond milk in a Vitamix. I save the resulting fine almond powder and I bake that until it dries out and I store it in the fridge. That works really well as almond flour in chaffles and is a huge cost savings.",
