Some tips for beginner bakers: This bread is perfect for beginners...it's very simple and there is no kneeding involved. You can use an instant read thermometer when warming your milk in a saucepan. It just needs to be somewhere between 120 and 130 degrees. Crisco works well for greasing the pans. Don't use a hand mixer to mix the dough..it's far too sticky. Use a Kichenaid mixer with a dough hook (switch to the dough hook AFTER the second round of flour goes in). If you don't have a Kitchenaid, you can use a cuisinart with the dough blade...it works just as well. If you have neither, you can mix it by hand, but that's sort of a pain. After you divide the dough into the pans (and before it starts to rise), sprinkle a little more cornmeal on top for more of an english muffin look. The bread is best toasted! We usually eat it with just butter, pb &j, or cream cheese. Oh..and I bake it at 425 instead of 400 because I like a crispier crust. ",

Toasted and lightly buttered this bread was awesome. I was able to make it in my bread machine too -- I cut the recipe in half to make a 1.5 lb loaf and used 1 1/2 tsp bread machine yeast instead of 2 1/4 tsp (.25 oz) active dry yeast. I also added about 1.5 tablespoon butter to the dough. I let it run on my basic setting with light crust. I let it cook for about 50 out of the 60 minutes but it would have turned out fine if I had left it in the entire time but it the crust was light and crunchy at 50 mins. A great recipe I'm sure to use it often. Thanks!",

Finally, to make it a little healthier I only use 1 tsp of salt (you'll never notice a difference!) \n\nWhen baking I like to put tin-foil over the loaves after 10 minutes of baking and leave on for the remaining 15.  Loaves still get crunchy but not quite as dark on top. This recipe is a keeper! :)",
