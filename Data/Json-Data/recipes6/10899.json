The cake is lovely and unusual to look at: white with black dots from the poppy seeds; filled and topped with yellow almond flavored custard.  It's easy to take to a picnic, potluck or gourmet dinner.  Just take the two cake layers and the bowl of custard.  Assemble at your destination. Always a hit.",

I don't mind because I love it. I read a few of the reviews and those that didn't make it with the almond custard filling is really missing the best part of the whole experience. It is a must! You can't substitute it with vanilla. What I have done in the past(just last week because it was my birthday) I used buttermilk (in the cake)instead of the dry milk and water I used 1 cup I have also used 3/4 c. milk. I wouldn't mess with the Almond Custard Filling recipe because I have tried to increase the filling and it didn't thicken enough. Just thinking about it makes me want for more!!",
