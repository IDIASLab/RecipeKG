To lower the fat content I used ground chuck turkey Italian sausage and reduced fat bacon. 2 tablespoons of diced onion sauteed with meat. I did precook the bacon but not to a crispy state. I used fire-roasted tomatoes and a thicker tomato sauce. Sugar was reduced significantly with no detriment to outcome. Followed cooking times and temps to the letter. I received many compliments on this dish. Personally I felt the bacon flavor was more powerful than it should be. Still I had a second helping. I am looking forward to my leftovers!",

The sausage was easy enough to chop before serving but not so the bacon. Some people ended up with a whole slice of bacon in their meal. Next time I will cook the bacon a little first just to cook off some of the grease chop it and then add it when the recipe calls for it. I'd still leave it very soft though because the bacon flavour it adds to the dish is wonderful. I thought of maybe taking the casings off the sausage and breaking it up like ground beef but having the slices of sausage was very nice. This was a very nice change from regular spaghetti and everyone loved it. I'll definitely make it again. Second time making it - I felt like there was too much sugar perhaps because I used a ready made spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. Add sugar to taste if using a spaghetti sauce",
