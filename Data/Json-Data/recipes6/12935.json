If you want a healthier cookie with more flavor, use half brown sugar and half white sugar, half whole wheat flour and half white flour, decreasing the shortening to 3/4 cup. For a spicier cookie that tastes more like pumpkin pie, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, and 1/4 tsp ginger (or just use 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice).  Cream cheese frosting goes very nicely with these cookies, per suggestions from prior reviews.  Thank you for a great eggless cookie recipe!!!",

I made a few changes: I halved the recipe and substituted margarine for the shortening. I also added a half cup of toasted chopped walnuts and a half teasp. of nutmeg and a pinch of allspice. I chilled the batter while I cleaned the kitchen and then rolled the batter into balls. I rolled the balls in granulated sugar and then flattened them with a fork.

It was also easier the second time around because I creamed the sugars and shortening first then added the pumpkin a little bit at a time. Otherwise it was hard to mix and the pumpkin was so wet that it splashed a lot. It is a very fast and easy cookie to make from scratch. The first time I used chocolate chips the second time I dressed it up for the holidays by dipping the tops in white chocolate and sprinkling with green edible glitter. They were very attractive and you get a bit of chocolate in each bite.",

I also used a sugar coated fork to gently press down on the cookies. (also I did two batches with chopped walnuts on top mmmmm good) They came out so good I can't wait for my kids to get home from school for this tasty snack. I will so make this again and again...;)",
