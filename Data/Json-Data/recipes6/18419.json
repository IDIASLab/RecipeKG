This recipes wins hands down over Grandmother's Bread Pudding and Bread Pudding with Whiskey Sauce III. The bread pudding alone is very flavorful. The addition of the sauce makes a great recipe even more decadent. I only made a couple of changes: I used fresh strawberries and a cup of frozen mixed berries (blackberries blueberries and raspberries). I also substituted buttermilk and heavy cream for about 3 of the 6 cups of the whole milk--I needed to use these items before they went bad. Update: I sent my husband with a batch to take to work and I took one to my place of employment. We both received comments stating that this was the best bread pudding EVER! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!",

Instead of using butter to grease the pan I sprayed 4 ramekins (halved the recipe) with cooking spray used an egg substitute for the eggs and f/f half & half for the whole milk. Baking the dish (or ramekins) in a water bath helps to eliminate a soggy center as some reviewers experienced. The spices complimented the fresh berries perfectly -- will make this again. Thanks!",

I followed the recipe exactly except the cooking time I had to add an extra 30 minutes and I didn't have very many blackberries so I added a few blueberries also I added pecans. I've made several different bread puddings and this is one of my new favorites. The mix of the berries and the brown sugar sauce is great. It tastes even better the next day! Make sure that you use a good french bread and that it's definately stale trust me it makes a difference. Thanks for a great recipe!",
