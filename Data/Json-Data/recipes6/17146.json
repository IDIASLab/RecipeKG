They're more of a \"peanut butter sandy\"-type cookie melt-in-your-mouth delicious and very very peanut buttery just like the recipe says. They are NOT soft and chewy (no eggs); they ARE a bit on the delicate side but I had no problem removing them from my cookie sheet after about 10 minutes and eating them still warm! I am still in search of my perfect p.b. cookie (I don't care much for the soft ones) and these will do nicely until I find exactly what I'm looking for. Yummy!",

There is a warning about them being crumbly they should not be gritty if you follow the recipe correctly and there is NO way they should not have any taste if you are following the recipe. If you don't like peanutbutter don't try these because they are very rich with peanut butter taste. Similarly if you are bothered by crumbliness don't try these. They are a favorite in my family but then again we like peanutbutter (most pb cookies are bland; these are not) and we don't mind them being crumbly (but I ALWAYS let them cool A LOT before removing them from the sheets.) If you want to try these I wouldn't listen to the people who gave them bad reviews but again I wouldn't try these if you are not a fan of BIG peanutbutter taste OR if your cookies MUST have the perfect texture because these",
