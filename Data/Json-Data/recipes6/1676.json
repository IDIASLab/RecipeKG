Whether it's a small family get together, or a game-day blow out, these are sure to delight food lovers of all ages. For the sauce I like to use stone-ground Dijon mustard. Feel free to experiment with different types of mustard, each one changes the flavor of the sauce. Regular yellow mustard makes the sauce slightly sweeter.",

The directions and timing were spot-on (also very easy in that there were no veggies to saute beforehand) and the meatloaf itself was very good in texture and taste but the sauce on top was too sweet for me too \"wierd\" for my daughter and just unnecessary for my husband who would rather drag his meatloaf through a condiment of his choosing. I also am not a fan of meatloaves that bake in constricted spaces like loaf or muffin pans so that they're just sitting in pools of grease so if I make these again I'll free-form it as a loaf in a 9X13 dish and tool around w/ the sauce ingredients if not drop the sauce entirely.",
