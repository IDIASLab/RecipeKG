The package of bison I got was 12 ounces so I made two patties out of it but next time would definitely make three to fit the regular size of Ball Park buns. Even with the thumbprint in the middle of the meat before I grilled it it still puffed up quite a bit. I cut the recipe to 3 servings to get to 2 (not sure why this problem with the serving sizes) and to make up for the added meat I used generous helpings of seasonings. I used chipotle powder rather than the pepper itself. Do yourself a favor and make this one soon! Thanks Ball Park Buns! You have a winner in our estimation!",

Instead of using garlic powder I used ground fresh garlic using my mortar and pestle for both the patties and the sauce. The sauce was really good and will be great to use again (especially if you're in a pinch and are out and don't want to run to the store). I used garlic oil on the buns and toasted them in my CIO for about 2 minutes per side on the medium grill setting. Then I grilled the burgers in my CIO on medium for 4 minutes per side adding some cheese for the last minute. We served it with the pickles and sauce only and they were perfection. Really pleased with these buns and the recipe.",
