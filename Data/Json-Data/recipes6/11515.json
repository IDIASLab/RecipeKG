I used 2 3/4 cups of cake and pastry flour instead of all-purpose increased the poppy seeds to 1/2 cup and added 2 tablespoons of vanilla sugar to the buttermilk/poppy seed mixture. The cake tested done at 45 minutes. Should start checking at 40 minutes. Used a 12 cup bundt pan and the cake after cooling was fairly deep. I added a vanilla glaze after the cake had cooled. A definite thumb's up from everyone who tried it.",

I used 3/4 c. of poppy seeds and almond extract as well as vanilla and use just sugar to coat the pan not cinnamon sugar and no layers, I did it in mini loaf pans so I could portion control so I only baked them for 25 min. If they were smaller I could have done it in mini muffin tins  15 or 10 min. \nThank You so much I have a favorite for sure.",

The title is deceiving though...look at the ingredients. While there are certainly poppy seeds there's much more flavor. The only catch to this cake is that when using a multi-patterned cake pan it is hard to see the design for the dark cinnamon crust. I am making a version without the crust now to see if it works. (I will miss the crust though it was sooo good.)",
