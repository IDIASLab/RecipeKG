The flavor was okay the cherries were good but it didn't taste like cheesecake at all. My family's compliment was \"this is different it's okay\". I might try making this again with some changes. My thoughts... add 4 oz softened cream cheese in with the pudding and yogurt (to firm it) and add a topping of whipped cream with some marashino cherries (the pie didn't look very pretty).",

But if your expecting cheese cake the flavor wasn't there. I could see making this with a peach or blueberry topping. If you want to save some calories use a fat free graham cracker crust.
