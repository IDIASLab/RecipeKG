The first time was perfect; the second time, the lentils were not cooked after 6 minutes in the pressure cooker. After a little research, I think I know why. The first time, I used brown lentils - the most common kind. The second time, I used green lentils (all I could find in the store that day). It turns out that green lentils typically take longer to cook than brown ones, and even when they're done, they're not as soft as the brown ones. The soup was definitely better with brown lentils. Except for that issue, the soup was easy to make and just right for a wintry day.",

I have no doubt the ham shanks and ham broth would be even more flavorful. I will try that next time!",

I use an electric pressure cooker and it took me 2 rounds of 6 minutes each at 20 pounds of pressure to get the lentils tender. YUMMY!",

I've never used a pressure cooker before and the soup was full bodied and flavorful. We like highly seasoned food and didn't think the ingredients would impart much flavor but this was perfect. Leftover ham and shank from the brown wrappered Smithfield Brown Sugar Spiral from BJs was used and the directions were followed exactly except for 3 more cloves of garlic and our choice of red lentils. Can't wait to share a bowl of this soup with my mom Jean who no longer cooks because she's in an Assisted Living facility (and was an excellent cook - my very own Julia Childs). Enjoy everyone you won't be disappointed.",

Next time I will put in 3. Also I needed to cook the lentils for 3 more minutes as they weren't quite done. While mine didn't look like the picture (mine looked a little more mushy) it was fantastic! My pressure cooker has a saute setting however I think next time I will saute in pan while the ham hocks are cooking. Because it was my first time and I had to add more cooking time it took forever as it takes 10-15 minutes to build up the pressure again. That was a bummer. I supposed once you get use to it things will go more smoothly. The flavor really was amazing!",
