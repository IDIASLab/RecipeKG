You can cut off what you want frozen to cook a couple of cookies at a time. Or you can put them in a container and freeze them and just scoop out what you want.\nThese cookies do remain MOIST if covered. \nTHANK YOU so very much for the BEST Chocolate cookie recipe I have ever had. PS.... you can substitute nuts, or raisins, etc. instead of the chocolate chips.\nEnjoy everyone....\nLaurie",

The cookies were greasy and flat. (And I didn't even grease the cookie sheets) They're flat tasting as well, probably because there's neither enough vanilla nor chocolate chips.  Their unappealing looks are the first indicator they're not good since they're flat and rather anemic looking, and the mouth feel is unpleasant, not \"soft\" but greasy and mushy.  Finally, the recipe is just poorly written. I've never heard, for example, of a cookie dough being \"whipped.\"",

I also used the suggestions people had - 1 tablespoon of vanilla and substitute a bit of baking powder for the baking soda. Mine definitely didn't come out flat like everyone elses. Since it didn't come out flat, it didn't expand to be gigantic. \n\nI made about 40-48 cookies (I like smaller cookies 3\"). I used what the ingredients said if you change the quantity to 18. The things I changed were: 1. 1 tablespoon + a bit more of vanilla extract (the taste came out great), 2. 1 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder (this caused them to come out very fluffy.. I suggest using maybe 1 1/4 baking soda, 1/4 baking powder so they're not flat), and 3. I used 1 cup and 4.5 tablespoons of butter. \n\nall in all, the cookies tasted great. My automatic scaling thing and maybe too much baking powder made them too fluffy. Good easy recipe!",
