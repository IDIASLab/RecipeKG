For years I dreamt of these corn dipper things and even contemplated writing to Burger King to ask for the recipe.  Well finally I found this recipe for corn fritters and tried it.  I was a bit nervous as I had never deep-fried before (but I just filled a small frying pan with about 1 cm of oil and did it that way).  Both my boyfriend and I agree that these corn fritters are better than the ones we had at Burger King.  I'm so, so happy that I found this recipe.  Thanks, Joan!",
