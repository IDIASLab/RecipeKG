I used the 20 ounce size but kept all the other sauce ingredients as written. It worked great for me. Using a smaller can of pineapple would result in less sauce since you are depending on the juice from the can so I would opt for the larger can. I would also make sure not to use an Italian frozen meatball. I don't think the flavors would meld with this at all. I used Aidells Chicken Meatballs in the Teriyaki & Pineapple flavor that I get at Costco which come in a 2.25 lb package. These were absolutely the perfect meatball for this recipe if you can find them. I also subbed an orange bell since it is what I had on hand. I think using different colors would make for a nice presentation. Very good! Oh, and make sure to use fresh lemon juice, even though it isn't called out. It's got to be fresh.",

I followed another reviewer's advice (Valerie's kitchen) and used the aidell's frozen chicken teriyaki meatballs and was disappointed. they turned out quite spongy and processed tasting. Not the fault of the recipe author, though, so I still gave this 5 stars for the ease and taste factor. I would just make my own simple meatballs next time since the sauce adds so much flavor, so you don't need to add a lot to your homemade meatballs. DEFINITELY double the sauce and use two 20 oz casn of pineapple if you like a saucy dish. Other than that, follow all other portions exactly (doubling). I also followed another reviewer's tip and used pineapple in the syrup instead of the juice. Oh, and I skipped the pepper altogether since I made this for a potluck and some people have an aversion to peppers. Didn't make a difference in the flavor - still wonderful!",
