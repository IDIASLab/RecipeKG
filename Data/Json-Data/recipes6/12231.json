These cookies have a good taste nothing spectacular but they don't look that good. I like my cookies and food in general to be very appealing to the eye. I was hoping these would be lighter in color (maybe I should've used a recipe w/o the brown sugar) and that they would have been more formed and not so FLAT. I tried baking them on a rimmed and non-rimmed sheet and on a Silpat mat all with the same results. I even tried refrigerating the dough so it wasn't that either. These are just okay. I am still looking for something that tastes and looks fabulous. Thanks for the recipe anyhow. Also I agree with reducing the amount of salt. A teaspoon is a little much.",
