I was concerned that they were too rich but once they baked the flavor evened out nicely. I Baked them for 9 minutes on a light cookie sheet with wax paper and one darker cookie sheet with wax paper. The lighter cookie sheet cookies were super soft on the bottom. I had to flip them over and bake for an additional 6 minutes at 2 minute intervals to insure they didn't burn. The darker cookie sheet cookies came out better slightly golden brown on the bottom. Flavor was good but I didn't love the texture. These were a little too light and \"airy\". Think I'll look for another recipe.",
