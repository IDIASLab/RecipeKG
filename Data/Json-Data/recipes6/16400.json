Since you can use soymilk in place of regular milk in any recipe this recipe isn't original or anyting but atleast it shows people liek the last reviewer that it's no big deal and doesn't make it taste a bit different.",

First I used 3 oz. flaxmeal and 1 oz. oil instead of the 1/4 C. oil. I didn't have wheat germ so I used almond flour instead. And since I didn't have soy flour I used 1 tbsp. black bean flour (which is extremely high in fiber). I also increased the almond extract to 1/2 tsp. In spite of all of these changes the pancakes were wonderful.",

I will say they turned out really fluffy and light even though made with whole wheat flour and wheat germ. VERY hearty. I served them with homemade maple-vanilla syrup.
