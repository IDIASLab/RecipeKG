I put it in the refrigerator in hopes that it would set up but all of the cookies still spread out to about 1/8\" thick (except for where the chocolate chips were). So the end product was very thin. Texture-wise they melted in one's mouth which was good but probably due to the amount of fat in them. Flavor-wise they were pretty good. I wasn't exactly sold on the crunchy element to them. It was different and interesting but not enough to carry the other downsides. Thank you for letting us try these though!",
