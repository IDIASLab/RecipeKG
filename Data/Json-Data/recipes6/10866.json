It's easy to make except I modified the recipe by using 2 whole large eggs (including the yolk & whites) instead of the 4 egg whites and used 2% milk. I think this is what helps cut down the prune taste. The first time I made it I paired it with a vanilla cream cheese frosting & filling I made. The second time around I made it with a butterscotch/caramel combined with heath bar pieces as a topping & filling which I brought to the office. My coworkers all enjoyed it and asked for the recipe. It also seems to taste better the 2nd or 3rd day stored in a covered cake stand at room temp.",

I find the powder sugar \"melts\" on top so don't sift it over the top until just before serving. If I'm using this for a birthday party I use the Vanilla-Chocolate frosting for it and people can't tell that it's low-fat! You can also put the whole egg in but that changes the nutritional info (as does the real frosting). Don't tell finicky eaters about the prunes though they'll reject it on principle. As for the 1-star reviewer whose boyfriend threw it out-- she HAD to have done something like make her own puree reduce the amount of coffee or cocoa because you cannot taste the prunes if it's made CORRECTLY.",
