After you make a batch of this and taste just how incredible it is, I don't think you'll ever buy that stuff from the store again. Sauce may be used right away, but for best results, wrap and refrigerate for a day or two before using to allow the flavors to develop.",

Because my store doesn't have 2 cup-sized ketchup bottles, the regular 20oz bottle is just a bit more I just use it all now, and it gives me a container to deliver the goods later. I think the flavors meld the best after hearing to a summer. Funnel back into ketchup bottle when done. \n\nOther tweaks to consider:\n- add Sriracha for a garlicky heat\n- too sweet? Add Soy and Worcestershire Sauce\n- want smokey? Add a 1/4 tsp liquid smoke\n\nOnce you make it the regular way, you'll want to experiment. Set out some ramikins and try adding pinches of different ingredients to see what you like.",
