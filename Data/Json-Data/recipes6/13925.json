For the brussel sprouts I took frozen sprouts, soaked in hot water until they are cuttable and halved them, then steamed them in the micro for about one minute, then put them in the fridge to cool.  I tossed the salad with the sprouts, bacon and sugar coated walnuts and served them chilled.  Yummy!",
