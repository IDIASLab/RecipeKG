Tip: If you peel a strip of the apple peel around the middle of the apple they actually hang together better - it allows room for the apple to expand.  3 hours was just perfect for my apples.  The slow cooker liners make clean up a breeze.  I didn't use raisins, some of my eaters don't care for them so I just left them out.  I did 4 apples in a 6 quart crock and there was actually room for at least two more.  I can see doing these on practice nights, start them before leaving for practice and by the time you are home and had dinner they will be done and waiting to be devoured.  Thanks for a nice recipe.  I love those slow cooker liners!",

I also believe we would have enjoyed It more if I would have removed the apple skins completely before cooking. I'm not sure if the apples are supposed to be tender or downright soft and mushy because that's how mine turned out after 3 hours on low. The flavor was good and not too sweet so as others mentioned very good on vanilla ice cream. I would make this again as it is a great dessert recipe that takes minimal work and attention but peel the apples before cooking and also check their tenderness after 2 hours or so.",
