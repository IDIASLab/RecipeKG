With more batches I have learned not to stir down the batter too much in the morning - otherwise you end up with flat rubber disks. I found that the batter was better as it came up to room temp especially if I stired it too much. I still want to try adding diced apple but so far have been Vetoed by the family.

Next time I'll cut the flour to 2 cups and increase the milk a bit. They were hard to spread on the grill a little lumpy but once cooked them you couldn't even tell. When I took it out of the fridge I let it sit for about 30 minutes before stirring (per the previous review) I did not want rubbery pancakes. They did come out soft with a little fluff to them. These are good when you want that light hint of sourdough flavor or you run out of your regular pancake mix.",
