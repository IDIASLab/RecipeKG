I used the bread machine from start to finish. Unfortunately my bread machine doesn't do well browning the top of the loaf so after removing it from the bread maker I brushed the top with butter and put it in a 375 degree oven for about 10 minutes.  This is a soft, moist, basic white bread with great flavor.",
