Don't skip the optional coconut, it really makes it tasty. These are quite crumbly though, so you will definitely need a fork to eat them. Very good with a cup of coffee. UPDATE: The next day, these were so crumbly, that I found the best way to eat it was to put a square in a bowl, add some milk (I used almond milk) and microwave it until warm, and eat it like a warm bowl of oatmeal.  I also found these to be very filling, and it kept me satisfied until lunch time or later.",

Mixed about 3/4 cup coconut into the batter.  Any ingredients I changed were substituted because that's what I had on hand. I don't have a square pan so I spooned the batter by 1/4 C full into muffin tin and cooked for 10 min.  They came out perfectly, but more like a muffin than a bar.  Nice and moist and should freeze well. Oh and it was easy!  Next time I want to add finely diced apple in place of blueberries.",
