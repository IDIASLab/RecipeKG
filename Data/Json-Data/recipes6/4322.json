Sprinkled one chicken boullion cube over this and added water before covering to cook. I also added some pasta water from (under)cooking bowties instead of rigatoni and then finished cooking the noodles with the broccoli mixture for a couple of minutes. Served with parm on top for a delicious and fitting side to chicken marsala. Mmmm",

I made this recipe with high expectations...I absolutely LOVE broccoli and I thought the combination of broccoli and pasta would be a sure hit. Unfortunately I was so disappointed. I followed the recipe to the letter even added some extra italian spices to give it more flavor but even that and the fresh basil could not save this pasta. It turned out very bland--only remedied by adding a ton of parmesan cheese on the pasta. I wish this had been better; I have still to find an excellent pasta and broccoli recipe. Although it was easy to make I unfortunately don't recommend this recipe.",

Any kind of tubular pasta will do for this dish even large elbow macaroni. You just want a shape that will hold on to the broth. Mangia!",

UPDATE: I made this again last night and has a bunch of bacon I needed to use up. I cooked the bracon and crumbled it into this dish and added a little extra broth while cooking the broccoli.
