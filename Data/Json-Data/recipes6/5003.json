My changes included swapping out the potato for half a head of cauliflower just because I had it and needed to use it for something. Then at the end I realized I was out of veggie or chicken stock so I had to use either beef or onion. I chose beef as those dry onion soup mixes are so salty and I had already added a fair amount of salt to the veggies. My body just can\u2019t take the salt. Lastly, I used milk instead of cream because I didn\u2019t have any cream. The final result was light and delicious. My husband even asked for a second bowl.",
