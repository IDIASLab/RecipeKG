I was skeptical at first about the Bran Flakes and buttermilk but the end product was deleted any and all doubts. When I made them I divided the recipe in half (seeing that it made for it made quite a few servings). From there I substituted margarine for shortening (surprisingly made no difference in texture or volume only intensified the taste) used whole wheat pastry flour instead (again no difference just a boost in nutrition) swapped a 1/3 cup of sugar for 2 tbs. of honey and FINALLY coated the top of the muffins with brown sugar before baking. This made for a delicious and presentable muffin that is more pleasing to the eye than just a regular old bran muffin. So I made a few personal alterations.. nothing major. I'm sure the basic original recipe would bake out the same results. All in the all the muffins were amazingly tasty and had even the pickiest eaters coming back for seconds..and thirds. PS: I refrigerated them overnight.",

I'm now whipping up the second batch 2 days later! I made these so my girls would have fresh healthy muffins for their first day of school and they inhaled them! I used raisin bran for the cereal and because the batter sits overnight the raisins plumped up nicely. This morning I added some chocolate chips and walnuts and made a dozen more. Fabulous! Tomorrow I'll add shredded carrots & walnuts to the last of it. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I bought Kellogs All Bran buds by mistake and used those instead, used 1/2 a cup of shortening and topped the rest of the cup with Organic Apple Sauce.  I only used 2 cups of sugar, brown sugar and added a cup of chopped walnuts.   Oh, I also used whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  I was suspicious of the batter when I looked at it almost a day and a half later but perservered and would you know it - fantastic muffins.  I probably overbaked them by a minute!  Next time, I will make the following changes: use whole wheat flour, bran flakes, 2 cups of brown sugar, 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup apple sauce and add walnuts.  The magic is the batter lasting 6 weeks - how good can this be!!!!  \r\n\r\nIt's funny, I seemed to make so many changes from the recipe which is daft really - how can you judge a recipe if you make all these changes - yet they were fantastic and I will stick to my changes.\r\n\r\n4 weeks later: I would like to add that the mixture didn't however make 48 muffins.  I only got 36 and mine weren't enormous.",

They taste to me like a plain buttermilk flavored muffin with bran flakes mixed in. The bran did not dissolve/distribute at all. Other recipes usually have you soak the bran in the milk I think I should have. Anyway sorry for the not so good review just not my taste. My son will be happy though cuz there is a lot of batter:)",
