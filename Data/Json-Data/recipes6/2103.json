I also only used 1/2 lb ground beef and no bacon (trying to lower the calories). Let cook for about 4 hours on low then 1 hour on high without the lid.. thickened right up.",

First time I was amazed at the balance to Tex-Mex and BBQ smokehouse flavor essences something I really didn't expect. Kids love this dish served them in taco shell bowls topped with shredded cheese ( cheddar or pepperjack ) and I've wowed guests stuffing Hobo Beans in emptied green pepper shells and oven roasting them. This Hobo Beans model WILL inspire you to add personal artisan touches / tweaks--but you got to first make this by the book.",
