Despite the fact that this fudge came out runny-ish-despite using a candy thermometer  at soft ball stage and freezing for several hours-- the taste was insanely amazing.  Like the most perfect taste ever. I am totally making this again; however, the next time I make it, I will make the following adjustments: A. Don't boil it on high high heat and B. cook it until I hit between soft and hard ball stage on the thermometer- I think because there is so much butter in this, it sets different than any other fudge that I have ever made.  As an additional note, after setting for an hour or so-- it could be the most perfect frosting ever.  Two other modifications that I made to put it over the top, instead of the total amount of conf sugar, I added half a cup of marshmallow and a cup of conf sugar.  This gave it a creamier appearance and less sicky sweet. Lastly, I added a few dashes of sea salt and chopped Heath bar on top- the flavors matched the fudge perfectly.  This is a great recipe, the cooking is tricky as it is with fudge generally.",

I had not been able to find any like it until now.  I had been looking in Latin stores, etc... I thought it was called Mexican Fudge but the kind I found at Latin stores/markets just hasn't been very good to me.  Trader Joe's sells something similar and they call it English Butter Fudge (it is delicious!!).\nAll I did differently from this recipe was stir some vanilla into it by hand after I mixed it with hand mixer because I am a vanilla fanatic!  I read others' reviews so what I also did was time it and use a thermometer.  After 10 minutes it had not reached the normal soft ball temp per my candy thermometer so I cooked it a tad bit longer to make sure it would not be too soft.  It never reached the desired temp.  Also, I made sure it didn't boil really hard, kept it at a lower to medium-ish  boil and stirred once in a while - don't think it needed the stirs though. I beat it exactly 5 mins. with hand mixer.  I did not use any walnuts because my husband doesn't like them and the cooks never added them either.\nA TIP: \nI always line my pans with foil and then butter the foil - makes it so much easier to get out (I take it out in one whole piece) and cut up. And you also don't scratch your pans by cutting it in them",
