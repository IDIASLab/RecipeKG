Seitan needs oil IN the dough to develop the gluten--not in the cooking liquid and never let it come to more than a slow simmer. I like to roll a log and then slice into cutlet then simmer them in a skillet with just enough water to cover turning halfway. I also use more seasoning- usually using a variety of condiments that seem to accumulate in the fridge. I like this best dredged in seasoned flour and lightly sauteed.",
