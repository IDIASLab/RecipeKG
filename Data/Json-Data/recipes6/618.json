I tend to use packaged baby carrots since we usually have those on hand and it's less prep time than whole carrots.  If you are on a budget, whole carrots are more economical, though.  I also prefer to steam my carrots instead of boiling them, because I like them to be soft but still have a slight crunch. When making the sauce, I tend to also cut back a slight bit on the brown sugar and add a splash of vanilla, but otherwise follow the directions.",

I felt like I was eating some type of candied vegetable holiday side dish. We ate some of it but unfortunately the rest got tossed. It needed something and butter and brown sugar just didn't work here for us. I am rating it a 3 because maybe someone might like a candied tasting vegetable. I don't care much for overly sweetened sweet potatoes here. I would love to know how others faired with this dish.",
