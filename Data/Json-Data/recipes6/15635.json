Eat with a glass of apple or orange juice as a great snack (because the crust can make you thirsty) or for desert heat up with vanilla ice cream. mmmmmm... i seriously cant say enough about these!

I made these to add to my Christmas goodie plate but will just end up putting them in the trash. Everyone who says that there is too much base is totally right cut it in half at least. It was really hard to mix. There is too much of it to fit in my stand mixer and I had to do it by hand but it is a very dense dough and hard to do. Also I had to add water to my apricot mixture because there wasn't enough moisture in the dried apricots to make a preserve with just those the lemon juice and the sugar. The apricots kept getting scorched at the bottom of the pan before I added the water. The flavors weren't even very good. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of just one is because they were moist. I will not make this recipe again. Dried apricots are expensive so this was a very expensive experiment/mistake.",
