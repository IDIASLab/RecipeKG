Using a mixer will change the texture of the bread and it will not turn out as good. Also something I always do is wait a couple minutes after you take the loaves out of the oven and wrap in aluminum foil. This will keep them moist.  My family always eats it with butter on it. Enjoy!  :0) Also bake it for 45 minutes and test it to see if it needs to bake a little longer. Everyones oven is different.",

As it was I took it out at 50 minutes and it was already dry even though I mixed everything by hand. EDIT: This edit from a 3 to a 5 comes the next day from making the bread. My family all loved the bread and I must admit that the flavors are much better the second day. Toasted with butter made a lot of difference and there is no way that I can overpower the votes of family members!:)",
