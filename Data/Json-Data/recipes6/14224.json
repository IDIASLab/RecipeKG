The first time I made it my husband licked the bowl clean!\n\nAny substitutions happened after we'd made it \"by the book\" the first time. I did use fresh beets all summer from our CSA, boiling them in their skins and then peeling and slicing them.\n\nThe most major change I made was adding heaps of fresh dill to the recipe, which my aunt commented on specifically at our summer BBQ (\"I never would have thought to add dill, but it's amazing).  DISCLAIMER: you have to like dill to add it!  LOL.\n\nWe also added lots of onion, and slices of cucumber and radishes.  Sometimes I used jarred mustard and sometimes mustard powder.  I reserved a little bit of the beet water when I boiled it, and added that to the vinegar/sugar marinade.  \n\nOnly rule is that you have to refrigerate it for a while to get the full effect.  Delicious!  Thank you!",
