Needs plenty of sugar and patience when rolling out. Best served a bit aged (let cut pieces rest a day or two to dry).",

As other reviewer's have already stated the proportions are way off. I also find the dough is MUCH easier to work with if you omit the butter (you really don't need the milk either but I add a little anyway). You need to keep adding sugar until your arm is ready to fall off from the stirring (stop before then and your dough is going to be too sticky). For a little over one cup of potato and 1 tbl. milk I had to use nearly 4 POUNDS of powdered sugar to get the dough to the proper consistency. But once there my dough didn't even have to be refigerated -- a little more sugar for dusting and it rolled out like a dream. I introduced my grandmother to this recipe last Christmas (she loves peanut butter) and she said she ate most of what I made herself!",
