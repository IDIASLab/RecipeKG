Imagine my suprise when not only my dear BIL but my dad and brother also chose this pie over their own personal favorites!\r\nI have made this pie at least 2 dozen times in the past 18 months and everytime it tastes better!  I had to make 4 of them in the month of April alone!  Sometimes I go to the pantry and find that I only have tidbits or chunks.  I just run them through my mini-chopper and voila! -- crushed pineapple!\r\nMy only suggestion would be to \"wash\" your uncooked crust with a beaten egg before you pour the still-warm filling into it in order to assure your crust will not be soggy.  My BIL insists this recipe is perfect just the way it is!!!",

Thanks so much for posting this.  I can sleep tonight now.  After I bake of course.  Oh...just about forgot.  Everyone who likes pineapple pie, loves this recipe, and it is so easy.  Just one little bit of advise.  For really easy clean-up use a nonstick sauce pan and I use 2 cans of pineapple for a 9\" deep pie.  You may have a little bit left over, but I would rather have too much than have too little.",
