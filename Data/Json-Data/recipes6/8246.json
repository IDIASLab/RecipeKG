Onto the review- I made changes and because I made changes I refuse to lower the rating even though the changes didn t work so well. I reduced the sour cream to 12 ounces and used 12 ounces plain greek yogurt. I did this to lower the overall fat/calories. It worked beautifully until I added in the plain Greek yogurt. Although I was careful the sauce did curdle. I found this remarkably similar to a stroganoff and it was delicious!",
