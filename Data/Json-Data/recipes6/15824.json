A 9X13 baking PAN would probably worked better than a 9X13 baking SHEET. I may try this recipe again but would like to know if I misinterpreted",

I've also worked in Old Salem and am quite familiar with the Moravian sugar cake from the wood-fired bakery there. This recipe is close but not on the money. First there is WAY too much cinnamon! I only made this recipe for the first time yesterday so I don't know if 4 TEASPOONS is what is meant: I tried to follow the recipe even though my gut told me it was too much cinnamon. Secondly baking time needed to be more like 30-35 minutes. My oven is accurate. I don't think the Moravians would put so much sugar but it's good-tasting. I think the dough recipe is close but the finished product was doughy. Not sure if more cooking would have done it. Also don't worry about making the holes in the dough too much. It works out even tho it seems not to. I know the Dewey's version went to using margarine instead of butter and for sure not nearly so much cinnamon but we always add more butter to the store-bought when we heat it up. However doughy and over-spiced as this turned out it will get eaten by the husband. Maybe if the finished product gets toasted in a pan the doughy \"cake\" part will become less objectionable. My son thinks the store-bought stuff has too much dough and not enough topping but this recipe fixes that issue with the ton of brown sugar and butter. I hope I have time to work on this again. It would be so cool to have the original taste made at home.",
