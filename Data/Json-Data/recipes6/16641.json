I suspect it might actually be a recipe for jumbo muffins and she forgot to mention that.  2. two apples made up more than 50% of the batter and was definitely too much so 1 apple is plenty.  3. She states to fill the cups to the top, however if you do, this is what you will end up with: 4 hours of scouring your oven and kitchen floor from all the overflow butter and sugar that leaked out of the oven.  Just follow the cardinal rule of muffins/cupcakes: never fill more than 2/3 full and you'll be fine.   4. Do NOT use 1/2 Cup butter for the \"sprinkle\" topping or you will end up with grainy pasty goo that will never (on planet Earth) sprinkle.  I suggest cutting back to 1/4 cup to keep the mixture on the dry side, allowing you to sprinkle it as she suggests.  I appreciated the taste she was going for.  Trust me, follow these 4 EASY corrections to this recipe and they will come out right!",

I also use applesauce for half of the oil, and that works well.  I like Granny Smith apples in these muffins because they hold their shape and flavor nicely (I cut them into big chunks because I like the apples to be noticeable!).  I find that extra cinnamon doesn't dry these out because the apples are so moist.  And for the topping, I use 1/4 cup of softened butter instead of 1/2, and this seems to be plenty.  I wouldn't fill the muffin cups more than 3/4 because the muffins do rise, and the topping can be messy in the oven.    Overall, this is a great recipe--wonderful flavor, texture, sweetness, moistness, etc.  :)",

We spent the balance of our post muffin morning cleaning the horrible burned on mess in the bottom of our oven from too full muffin cups.  Filling the tin less would probably yield a full dozen normal sized muffins.  With this correction they should be excellent!",

I found that if you change some of the ingredients, like instead of 1.5 cups of sugar, I just used one; Instead of 2/3 cups of oil and milk i used 1/3 of both, added an extra egg and some hot water to replace the milk and oil, the mixture turns out more fluffy and light. Nice simple recipe tho :)",
