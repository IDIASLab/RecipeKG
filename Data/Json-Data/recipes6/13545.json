Recommendations from someone who rarely cooks (me): Be ready with a little extra oil and milk because the dough may be too dry to roll using the amounts in the recipe. Just add a little oil and a little milk and mix it in your hands until it s sticky but not too sticky. Also you may not want to use the top piece of parchment since it s awfully hard to roll when you can t see it and it s slipping all around;-) Be sure you use the instant tapioca! (Don t prepare it just use the dry stuff in the box.) Oh and for the rhubarb after slicing it into 1 inch pieces slice it once the long way in order to bring out the flavor. For those of you that are worried about making a big mess in the stove cover the bottom rack with aluminum foil so you can catch any extra filling that might seep out. When sealing the pie go around the edges with a fork it give it a nice look. This was my first homemade crust and it turned out great!",

With all of my pie crusts, before the pie goes in the oven, I take a long strip of aluminum foil & rim it around the outer edge of the pie crust.  Ten minutes before done, I remove the foil.  In this way, you will always have a nice crust -- no burnt edges.  I also brush the top crust with egg wash  & sprinkle with white sugar for added sparkle.  Another variation is to just sprinkle the top with water & use turbinado Sugar In The Raw) for sprinkles.  You can make several variations of pie slits; the easiest is to take a tableknife & insert into crust; make a small twist to resemble a bow tie.  I have used mini cookie cutter shapes to vent the top crust also -- and reuse the cut out pieces as added decoration pressed along the outer edge of the pie crust.",
