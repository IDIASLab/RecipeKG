Knowing she'd have her martini at the house before we took her out to dinner last night I never thought this cake would fit into the scenario for the evening. But she tried a \"taste \" finished a decent-sized piece and after dinner took another 4 pieces home individually wrapped. It hooked her. As for Hubs he rarely eats dessert in the evening particularly chocolate. But he relented sat to himself and enjoyed a little slice followed by another perfectly content just he and his cake. Make no mistake - this is NOT banana bread covered in frosting provided your technique is correct. Cream the butter and sugar add eggs one at at a time then the vanilla. Stir in the bananas. Then add the flour in three additions with the buttermilk beginning and ending with the flour just until combined. This is a light and fluffy cake with a more aerated rather than dense crumb - and it's plenty sweet particularly if you use nearly black bananas as I did. I'm glad I topped it with Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting (an amended version to make it more chocolatey) to kind of temper that sweetness. I coated the sides lightly with toasted chopped pecans and garnished the top with dark chocolate curls and dried banana chips. This is a three-tiered showpiece. Normally this would have gone to the office with Hubs. This time at his request it stayed home.",

Not like a cake at all but more like a banana bread. I made it in a bundt pan. I too decreased the sugar to 1 cup but it was still very sweet. My grandkids LOVED it tho.
