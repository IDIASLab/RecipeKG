I was in a hurry and just made them. The plain muffin inside was lacking something. I think a little cinnamon there like another reviewer suggested would have done it, even without the entire thing being rolled in the topping. As far as the milk, I started out with 3/4 cup but added more during the mixing to get a consistency I could work with putting in the muffin cups. I would say it was at least a cup. I just kept adding and stirred it in until I could work with it and even then was thinking it could use a tad more. My batter was not lumpy after all of this, but they baked up gorgeous in about 15 minutes as another had said. Mine were light and fluffy with nice peaks on them. Everyone still gobbled them up, but I am giving it 4 stars since the basic muffin still needs something.   ",
