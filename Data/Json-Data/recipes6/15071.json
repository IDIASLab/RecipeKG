If you are desperate for a chocolate dessert and have run out of flour(I was needed brownies for church function and hadn't been shopping sick kid at home) these are ok. It was the only recipe I could find with no flour using semi- sweet chocolate. The middle was cakelike but I preferred the ends which were crusty & chewy. It was not too sweet (some brownies are so rich & sickeningly sweet that you can't eat more than a sliver). My kids liked it. I prefer moist fudgier brownies with a chewier texture and more chocolate flavor. I entered these in a brownie competition at church to benefit charity. I did not win but I liked these better than the 2nd place winner! I noticed that the recipe does not give an amount for the nuts. I used 1/2 cup broken pecans. Later I looked up the Bisquick recipe and that asks for 3/4 cup chopped nuts. It also says use butter or margarine softened & sweet cooking chocolate. The results may have been different had I used butter more nuts sweet chocolate and packed the 1/2 cup brown sugar. This recipe bailed me out but bottom line if I had flour and unsweetened chocolate I would choose to make a different brownie recipe.",
