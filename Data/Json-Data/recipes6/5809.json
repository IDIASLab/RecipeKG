One can is 1-1/2 cups so if you make this change you will either have a more acidic salad or you can add a second can if you want the corn to be center stage. I went with the first cause I absolutely love tomatoes. I did not reduce anything else but next time I will likely reduce or skip the apple cider vinegar since it's already so acidic. This is a great basic dish and you can go through your fridge/freezer/pantry and add more to change it up or use up other items you have on hand. This would be great as a bread topping as well.",
