The golden raisins and walnuts make them a nice variation of traditional oatmeal raisin cookies. I used a large Pampered Chef cookie scoop to drop my dough in golf ball-sized portions. I was pleased to get twice the expected yield--three dozen cookies each four inches in diameter. Thirteen minutes of baking time was enough to produce soft chewy cookies.",

The taste itself is very good but tasted like other easier oatmeal cookies recipes I have made. I think 1 cup of butter is too much and the cookies tasted a little too buttery and probably added to the other problem I had. The cookie dough was pretty easy to make but that was where the ease ended. Making these the exact size stated in the recipe doesn't work. Cooked for 20 minutes ours still were not done so we baked them a little more. After taking them out of the oven and letting them sit for a few minutes they still fell apart. Maybe it is a typo in the printed recipe but the dough should be dropped onto the cookie sheet in a teaspoon not a Tablespoon. Sorry but I think I will stick to other oatmeal cookie recipes and just add wheat germ to them.",
