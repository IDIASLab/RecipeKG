I, however, have made an extensive alteration to this recipe that I could post as a new recipe but I find the instructions and basic ingredients from Mogirimi so wonderful that I just decided to post my modifications. My modified flan is orange-flavored and it turned out perfect. To make the flan slightly richer I used 6 whole eggs (you'll get more custard mix this way) and used regular sweetened condense milk. I subsituted 1/4 cup of the water with triple sec (any orange liquer will do) and added 1 tps of grated orange peel. I also added nutmeg to taste. For the sugar, I highly advise you use baker's quality sugar (it melts better). Cooking time will vary depending on what you put your custard in. It may take an hour if the water you added was not boiling and you are cooking in a pie pan (mine took an hour). This orange-flavored version is to die for. I made it for Cinco de Mayo and it disappeared. Enjoy!",
