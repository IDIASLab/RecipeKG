I timed the whole process, and from start to finish it took me an hour and half, mostly because it simply takes a very long time for \"most the milk\" to evaporate. Still, patience paid off, and the recipe was delicious. It didn't seem as sickeningly sweet to me as some other Indian desserts I've tried, although it certainly is sweet. I used golden raisins, which tasted great, but I think regular raisins would serve as a better garnish because they would provide greater contrast against the cashews and carrots. Although making this dessert took a long time, it was extremely easy and except for the cardamom (which I had to buy for this recipe, but will use in other Indian dishes), the ingredients are all very simple and straightforward. We'll be enjoying this dish in my daughter's 5th grade class tomorrow as part of an early Diwali festival celebration, so thanks to the poster for sharing the recipe.",

The cardamom is a must to get the full experience of this dish. Not counting shredding the carrots I can make this in about 20-30 minutes if I brown the cashews at the same time as I m cooking the carrots. For the carrots I cook them on the highest setting my big burner will go and stir constantly so they don t burn. This cuts the time down but you have to stir continuously.",

I also used a combination of cashews and almonds. I cut the butter in 1/2 and didn't add any sugar at all. The vanilla almond milk made it sweet enough. I added a little of the carrot milk out of the pan to the pan with the nuts. Instead of cardamon I used a pinch of pumpkin pie spice. SOOO Yummy.",
