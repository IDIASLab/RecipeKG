I was in a rush when I made this so I turned up the flame and cooked it in about an hour total. Next time I will add another can of beans. Used a packet of fajita seasoning. Thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and will definitely be making it again. Hopefully I will take more time the next time to let it simmer.",
