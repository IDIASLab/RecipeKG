We're watching our cholesterol a little more closely these days so I substituted Egg Beaters for the whole eggs and cut back the brown sugar (personal taste preference). I find that so many recipes have way too much cinnamon (a powerful spice) overpowering everything but this oatmeal has a subtle layer of cinnamon which will allow you to mix in whatever other ingredients you like (as suggested by the recipe author). I topped mine with a spoonful of chunky applesauce a great partner to the cinnamon. kjerickson really enjoyed your recipe and I'll be making this again.",
