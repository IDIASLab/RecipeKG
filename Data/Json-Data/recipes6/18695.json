I reduced the beef broth amount to 1 cup, threw in everything, except the sour cream and flour, in the morning before work. Then when I got home, I made a 'roux' with the sour cream and flour and then tossed it in to the stew. My husband has ranked this stew as one of his all-time favourite dishes! A word of caution about parsnips. If you've never had them, they are highly flavoured and definitely influence the overall taste of the stew. If you like them, you'll love the stew as written. If you don't, just take them out and add more of the other vegetables.",

Because it was to be the \"quick supper before Christmas Eve services \" I braised the lamb in advance then dumped the veggies and broth and wine with the lamb into the slow cooker for an hour on high then on low for 5 hours. The butternut squash disintegrated entirely but really richened the gravy -- I think next time I'll add the squash later on in the cooking. Also I don't like sweet potatoes so I used red-skinned potatoes instead and used turnips instead of parsnips. It was lovely. I served it with a green salad and angel biscuits and a lightish red wine -- perfect combo.",

I also had a lot of leftover veggies I didn't use so I chopped them up and blanched them for 3 min. Then measured out the required amounts for the recipe and put it all in a Ziplock bag and froze it. Now all I have to do next time is drop in the contents of the bag and there will be no peeling or chopping. Update: I've been making this stew (using beef) for years now and it remains my favorite. There is nothing quite like the flavors of the red wine and sour cream that change it from an ordinary beef stew to something extraordinary.",
