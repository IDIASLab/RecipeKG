I also added a splash of almond extract at the very end of beating. Very good.",

I made this as written the first time and then cut the sugar and added cornstarch the next time. Toasting the nuts added a lot of flavor. That made for a very good cookie. I baked mine the second time on a lower heat because the cookies were browning a bit too much in my oven. I also added some almond extract. You may like them that sweet seems others do.",
