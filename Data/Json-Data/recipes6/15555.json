Then made it per the reviewers suggestions and it was much, much better!  Definitely decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup; your blood sugar levels will thank you!!!  Increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon and a note of caution - DO NOT use cheap vanilla as you can taste the difference between good vanilla and the inexpensive type sold in the supermarket.  You'll be glad you did...  Thanks Jeanie for submitting this great recipe!  Definitely a keeper!!!",

Much better than any crud you get in the packets, you know that there aren't any dyes or anything artificial in this which is why I choose to hand-make our cocoa.  \r\n\r\nI gave it a 5 star rating but it is  very, very sweet! And I have a sweet tooth!  ***AND*** I only used 1/2 C sugar.  I would definitey not use the 3/4 C, it will be too sickening sweet. \r\n\r\nTo make it less sweet you could either decrease the sugar amount further or add more hot water, I suppose.\r\n\r\nOverall great alternative to the store bought \"stuff\".",
