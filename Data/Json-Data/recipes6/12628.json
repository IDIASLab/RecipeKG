I use mini peanut butter cup baking pieces (find next to regular baking chips) and obviously don't chop them. I fold half the bag in with the nuts and press the rest on top as the recipe says. The drizzle is just extra yummy-ness! But I only use 1/2 cup chips 1 T. butter and 2 T. peanut butter for the drizzle and it is plenty. These bars are awesome thanks for the recipe!",
