I also used homemade gnocchi & fresh spinach because that was all I had. My soup was a little thick so next time I think I will use more milk and less half n half. Each bowl was topped with grated parmigiana. A must try!! Both kids and hubby devoured it.",

So, I did not use rosemary, or celery. I also used all 2% milk for the two listed dairy ingredients and did need a bit of cornstarch at the end. Roux is better but we try to go g/f when it's easy. This is a great recipe. \nUpdate: leftover rotisserie chicken is a yummy and easy sub.",

I made this recipe almost exactly as written (I did use butter instead of margarine cause that's all I had but other than that no changes). While overall it did have a good flavor both my husband and I felt that the butter and seasonings overpowered the soup. I'm not sure if it was the nutmeg or the Rosemary but it was too strong. And the whole stick of butter just gave it a greasy heavy feeling. I'm disappointed as I was really expecting this to be a new favorite. Will keep searching for something a bit closer to Olive Garden.",
