I used organic Yukon gold potatoes but they really small and there was no way I was going to peel them so I cooked them skin on and a put them in the blender with the pepper garlic ginger mix. I was a bit scared because blender mashed potatoes =ewww however I didn't want any of the skins to clog my ricer. It was a total success. After I had a smooth mixture I transferred to a bowl and added the flour. They came out so well and it makes a lot. I love that they are gluten free and vegan. Hubs and I snacked on them like popcorn while watching tv.",
