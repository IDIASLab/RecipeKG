These simple substitutions made these cookies more enjoyable then the original recipe. - D&H",

You can change this up by skipping the nutmeg and subbing a tsp. of vanilla or by putting a little fresh lemon zest in. I looked at the other reviews and altered the recipe with 2 Tbsp. more of sugar and about 3 Tbsp. more sour cream. The dough is delicious the cookies are tender. Rolled them out to 1/4 inch thickness as 1/2 inch seemed way too thick. Baked about 10 minutes then cooled on the sheet for a few minutes before transferring to the cooling rack.",

Even my husband who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth loved them!
