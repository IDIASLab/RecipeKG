I read ALL the reviews &.....since my friend is 103 yrs old & her daughter is 83...I wanted to make sure the bars were soft enough for her to chew easily. So I added BOTH the egg beaten...AND 2 tsp of Coconut Oil! I also added just 1 Tbs. of finely chopped walnuts to the flour mixture. Then after they were done baking...I put the 8\"X 8\" pan (I don't have a 9\"x9\" pan) on a baking rack & sprinkled them w/powdered sugar instead of more coconut. Deeeelicious is all we can say!!!! Really give these New Zealand Bars a try! I had never even HEARD of these bars before.... let alone MAKE them! But wow! The dates were soft & chewy & the bars were so different & SO yummy!!! My friend absolutely LOVED them!! Will definitely be making THESE bars again but the next time I will DOUBLE the recipe & use a 9\" X 13\" pan.",
