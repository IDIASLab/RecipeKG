I had mini cinnamon chips, so 1/2 cup was plenty. If you have the full-size ones, you'll probably want more. Just sprinkle as much as you want over the top. If you don't have cinnamon chips at all, try butterscotch chips!",

This is more like a sponge cake with that same type of cream cheese filling in danishes but with pumpkin added. That isn't to say it's bad. It's more cakelike than I expected is all. I used my blend of pumpkin pie spice' 1/2t cinnamon 1/4t ginger 1/8t nutmeg. A little 411: If you use your mix use the same amount as you would for a pie. I tried half tasted & then added the same amount again - which equalled a pie amount. I like my pumpkin pie more pumpkintasting than spicetasting so the amounts probably appear low if you prefer spicier. A reviewer mentioned the pumpkin part not being sweet - no sugar added there - so I went with 1 1/3c sugar in the cake & 1/3c in the cream cheese/pumpkin part. I didn't add any chips on top. Pretty dessert & love the no cleanup!",
