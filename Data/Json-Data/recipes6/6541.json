I cut down on the cayenne and put out the Frank's hot sauce for my hubby which is our usual compromise.\nEdit:  normally I don't make changes to the recipes, but since we are in the middle of a pandemic I did.  I used Rotel in place of the salsa.  Worked fine.",

This will definitely become a staple recipe.\nUpdate: made this again, this time just using water (no broth, because I forgot it) and only 1 cup of rice (for half a recipe). It turned out great, with all of the rice completely cooked. Served in flour tortillas with sour cream.",

It may have been the type of rice we used, or a weak foil seal, but we had to about double the fluid (which added cooking time).  \n\nThe dish is great. It was hearty and flavorful, and the recipe is easy. We topped it with a little cheese, cilantro and scallions. I added a dollop of sour cream, my spouse added a bit of extra salsa. It would be good as either an entree or a side dish.\n\nThe next time I make this I'll halve the recipe because this completely fills a lasagna pan.",
