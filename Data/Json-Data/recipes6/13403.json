I used 3 granny smith apples diced thinly which was slightly more than 3 cups. I was a tad surpised that the apples were somewhat crunchy in spite of the 10 minute extra baking time. Nonetheless the filling was superb and not too sweet. I would like to caution those who are searching for a strong sour cream flavor this probably isn't for you. The strong sour cream flavor I was looking for was not there.Perhaps the topping overpowered the sour cream flavor....but it truly enhanced the filling flavors nonetheless. This pie is a unique and excitingly outstanding new dessert that I will make again and again especially for dinner guests as the presentation is very beautiful as well.Thanks Eleanor.",

I increased the sugar to 1 C. and used half brown sugar and half white. I also excluded the nutmeg and added 1 1/2 tblsp of cinnamon instead. I also coated the apple with about 1/4 c white sugar and 2 teas. of cinnamon before mixing them in the sour cream mixture. For the topping I double the amount of butter called for. Next time I will try adding a little allspice and cloves. Will make this again often!!",

The sour cream mixture seems very runny when you pour it in the pie shell but bakes up to have the texture and consistency of baked custard but with a distinct sweet creamy taste. I used a deep-dish 9\" pieplate and was glad I did as this made a big pie. I followed the recipe except for adding about 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans and an additional tablespoon of butter to the topping mixture. I used about 3 1/2 cups of chopped fuji apples I did not have any pie apples on hand I would recommend good tart pie apples for this recipe. I also put the pie back in the oven for an additional 10 minutes at 400 degrees to brown the topping some more I imagine you could put the topping on at the start of baking or at least for the last 30 minutes to get it nice and crisp. I'll make this again!",
