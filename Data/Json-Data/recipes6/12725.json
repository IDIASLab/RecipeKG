Just sayin'. (Glass stainless steel or preferably copper are better choices.) I really enjoyed these cookies. They are delicate in both taste and texture made unique by the ground hazelnuts with a hint of lemon. Great recipe and easy as long as you have blanched (skinned) and toasted hazelnuts on hand. If not toast shelled hazelnuts in a 350F oven for 10-15 minutes transfer to a bowl and cover with a towel let steam one minute then rub off the skins. (That's the method I used.)",
