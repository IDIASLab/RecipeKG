I sometimes use small white beans when out of garbanzos, and add avocado and/or cooked quinoa, tomato, or cucumber to change it up or stretch it. It is great for picnics, potlucks, and kids' school lunches, and can be side or main dish, served on a bed of spinach, or in a wrap.",

Also - I now cook the edamame and add it to the rest towards the end of cooking time - I found the texture is more satisfying. I also use red onions and add them at the end for that bit of crunch. Another update: I wanted to use up what I still had in the refrigerator so I made quesadillas with it. All I did was add some salsa to the salad and put it with some cheese on a flour tortilla that I painted olive oil onto the outside -folded and baked at 350 for about 10 mins. - turned on the broiler and browned the tops - we LOVED them! LOVED this!! I skipped the garbanzo beans and added quinoa and avocado. This was our first time having edamame and it was a nice experience. Meanwhile I can't wait to try this salad in a wrap with spinach and chicken!! We used gluten free chips and enjoyed it a lot! Also it lasts for quite a few days in the refrigerator - warm or cold - it was a healthy way to start 2014!! Happy New Year and Thanks for the recipe!",

I will eat it cold right out of the fridge or I warm it up and just eat it by the spoonful. There is so much fiber in it that it fills you up quickly. I just eat a few spoonfuls as a snack. You can also warm it up and mix in a little dab of sour cream - awesome! I made chicken in the crock pot shredded it and put the chicken with this bean mixture and sour cream into a soft tortilla - so good. We top baked potatoes with this as well. SO many ways to use it. The first time I made it I followed the directions as is except I did not include cilantro - my family doesn't like it. After that I made only one change - I reduced the amount of salt. I only use 1/2 teaspoon. One teaspoon was a bit too much for us. I would start with 1/2 teaspoon taste it and add more if you want. I also add the cumin and salt to the lime juice and then mix it in with the beans I think the dry ingredients blend better when you wix it with the lime juice first.",
