I wasn\u2019t sure how to shape it after cutting the dough into pieces, so I searched online.  It looks like it is usually in squares, so I shaped the dough into a square and cut it into 9 smaller squares before the second rise.  Overall the consistency and flavor are nice but it would benefit from more salt and (I don\u2019t know if this would threaten its authenticity) a touch of molasses.",
