Some tips: 1) never use a plastic bowl to mix in, 2) be sure there's no oil or butter (or shortening, etc) on your utensils or bowl, 3) as the recipe says, be sure the egg whites are VERY firm before you start adding sugar, and don't stop beating the sugar/eggwhites until you can make peaks that don't fall down, 4) if you just can't get good peaks, it may be too humid in your house--put your merigue on a pie & try the cookies another day. I like to make these cookies in the evening. You can preheat your oven to 275, put the cookies in, turn the oven OFF, and leave them until morning! They'll be perfectly cooked. :o)",

They really are just the right amount crisp and chewy.\r\n\r\nYou must beat the egg whites for a long time, until they produce stiff peaks and turn glossy.

I use non-stick cookware too. I wasn't sure if I should spray the pan first or not but since the recipe didn't call for it I didn't do it. Two strikes is an 'out' for me!",
