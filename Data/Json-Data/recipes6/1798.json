You don't need any kind of sauce topping for this, as it makes a syrup that goes to the bottom of the pudding. I made the recipe just as stated (except for adding 1 t vanilla), and at 45 min, the pudding almost poured out when I pulled out the pan to take a look. I had to cook for 1 hour total, and it is still a very wet pudding. I don't think 3 c of bread cubes is enough for 2 c of milk-- I put almost 4 c of cubes, and it could have used at least another c of cubes. It's interesting they way she has you stir the brown sugar, butter and cinnamon together and then toss in the bread cubes. They don't really \"coat.\" The brown sugar mixture is very thick, and most of the bread cubes become crumbs while you incorporate all the cubes in the mixture. Every other bread pudding recipe I have made has you mix the sugar in with the milk and eggs. However, the end result is yummy if you like your bread pudding very sweet and squishy. :)",

Poured the liquid ingredients over both and backed at 350 degrees for 55 min. It was delicious. My husband is not crazy about bread pudding but loved this one.",
