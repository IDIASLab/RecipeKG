The second time, I increased the butter to 1 cup and reduced the sugar by half...the result was an awesomely some, buttery cake with a moist and delicious cheese topping...lovely! This one is a keeper and dh even asked me to make another to give to the neighbours! I made it for mom and she has not stopped raving since...everyone who has tried it asked for the recipe. With these 2 alterations, this one is a winner! Thanks Barbara!",

I am not typically a box cake baker, so I am not sure if yellow cake mix is close to the same thing, but I think using vanilla cake mix gave it an amazing flavor.  2. Use only 2 cups of confectioner's sugar. There is absolutely NO need for 4 cups - not for consistency, and definitely not for sweetness. 2 cups cuts those horrid calories in half and is plenty sweet. Trust me. 3. Bake for only 30-35 minutes, NOT 40+! I pulled mine out and I could tell it was still soft in the center, but a toothpick inserted in the middle came out clean so I took the chance. Best move ever.  The middle was soft and moist and buttery and heavenly! Everyone was Mmmm-ing and Ohhh-ing as they ate it. A few said they'd love it with chocolate or caramel drizzled lightly on top (or both!).  I'm making this again soon for a dear friend and her hubby and I can't wait to Mmmm over it again!",
