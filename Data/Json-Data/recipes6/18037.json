Good for anyone looking for a rhubarb dessert that wasn't \"too sweet.\" The sour cream topping and cheesecake layer made an interesting combination with the rhubarb but I think whipped cream on top instead of the sour cream topping would have been better. Also the suggested 30 minutes of baking after adding the cheesecake layer seems far too long. My oven bakes at a fairly accurate temperature and the cheesecake layer was perfectly set at only 15 minutes. Over all it was okay but probably not the first rhubarb recipe I would reach for.",
