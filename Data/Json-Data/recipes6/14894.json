I took a few suggestions from other reviewers and the result was perfect. I used 1 T. of zest and about 2 T. orange marmalade in the batter (tho' I don't know that the marmalade was really necessary). I made the cake in two 8-inch layers, and made the frosting as stated with just a little less vanilla than called for, which made enough to fill and frost the top. The orange flavor came through perfectly, the cake is moist and a beautiful shade of yellow-orange. The frosting is a must in my opinion, creamy and fluffy, and takes this cake over the top. I made this for my husband to take to the office tomorrow, but this cake is staying right here! ",

I didn't make the icing though, as I found an even better recipe. A recipe intitled \"Orange Loaf\" by Carol is a recipe for a yummy orange bread AND an orange glaze. I used the glaze recipe instead of icing and it turned out amazing!:) Less fat too! The recipe is: Combine 1/2 cup orange juice with 1/4 cup sugar in a small saucepan. Heat and stir to dissolve sugar. Spoon glaze over hot cake. Let stand in pan for 10 minutes before removing cake from pan. I also garnished the top with halved orange rounds. It looked beautiful!

So what I did was added more orange zest but what I think made it perfect was the 2 1/2 tablespoons of Grand Marnier (an orange liquer). I imagine you can use orange extract but I didn't have it. It was absolutely delicious. It baked so well to a golden brown. I will never make a boxed cake again! I used an old Sour Cream Chocolate Frosting recipe of my mothers it was awesome. My husband was in heaven told me how yummy it was with every bith he took. Two thumbs up Excellent! Thanks.",

In the past I have not had good results with your basic cake recipe (they have been a little dry) so I added 1/4 cup of sour cream and a pkg. of lemon jelatin to the cake batter. This definitely made it a moist cake. My husband liked it also and he is not a sweets fan. He really liked the citrus flavor. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. It was great! Wilma",

It was done in 30 mins. I also made the frosting it s really good but a tad too sweet for my taste. Still would make the frosting again but maybe a bit less powdered sugar.
