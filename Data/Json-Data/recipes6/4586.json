Be wary - the spinach really cooks down significantly. Five cups of spinach really means five cups of spinach. The cooking dish will start to look ridiculously full, but keep adding that spinach because it reduces down to a fairly small bed once cooked. We second-guessed the amount and ended up sadly short on spinach. ",

I heeded the other reveiwers' suggestion that there was too much broth in this recipe and substituted 1/2 cup canned clam juice for the vegetable broth. I had no fresh dill, so I used 1 teaspoon of dried. I salted and peppered the fish after settling it on the spinach, then thoroughly mixed all the other spices in a small prep bowl and sprinkled on top of the fillets before covering with the onion and lemon slices. My fillets were rather thick, so I found it necessary to add about 7-8 minutes to the baking time. I suggest checking to see if the fish flake easily with a fork after 25 minutes, then adding more time if necessary. Presentation is key, so I used a slotted spatula to slide under each fillet and spinach and then onto the plate, then garnished with the cerry tomatoes. Delicious and a great presentation for a dinner when you want to impress. BTW, I had fresh rockfish caught the day before in the Chesapeake Bay so this helped with achieving a final result that was memorable!",

About 2/3 of the way through the baking process I checked on the fish only to discover that the spinach was laying in a dry mat at the bottom of the dish. I added some broth at that time and rescued the meal but it would have been better if the broth had been in there to begin with. I used fresh baby spinach and I'm wondering if the reviewers who said it was soupy used frozen spinach? Anyway I will make it again but with the broth this time.:-) The only thing I changed was to use thyme instead of dill. I served it with rice pilaf and it was quite yummy.",
