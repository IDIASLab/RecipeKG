I heeded the advice of others and omitted the cream of tartar. I cut back baking powder to only 3 tsp. thought 4 tsp. was too much. I gently pulled mixture together after cutting in butter, with my hands in mixing bowl and instead of rolling and cutting, I formed into 12 gently formed balls. Flattened top just slightly and sprinkled with coarse sugar carefully cuz it tends to want to roll of the top. Just lightly pat into top so it stays put. They were great! Taste a little bit like shortbread. Very tender. I always use more sugar in my strawberries to create more of a juice. For the viewer that was wondering why theirs came out flat, check the expiration date on your baking powder, it is usually found on the bottom of the can. It doesn't stay fresh that long, so that might have been the problem. Hope this helps. Thanks Sara, this was delish!",

I was able to successfully double the biscuit recipe and bake in a 9-x-13 pan.  I kneaded the dough right in the bowl and then pressed into the 9-x-13 pan.  I forked the raw dough in the pan before baking.  It took my oven about 35- to 40-minutes to be done.  I cooled it about 10 minutes in the pan and then turned out on a rack to cool.  I sliced the biscuit in half  horizontally using a serrated knice and flipped it over on a serving platter using a thin cookie sheet like a giant spatula.  I then slathered the warm biscuit with butter and then layered the fresh strawberries with their juice that I had sliced up the night before with a little sugar and lemon juice on top followed by fresh whipped cream, the next buttered biscuit and then another layer of strawberries and cream.  Let it sit overnight in the frig, and it was delicious.  Presented the large cake for the crowd, and they loved it.  It sliced nicely into tall squares--some fell over, but it tasted incredible.  Thanks.",

I also roll them in my hands and flatten on the cookie sheet and use half-and-half if I don't have the cream. I originally made this recipe following all ingredients to a T and it was delicious my lemon version just sounded good one night. I also mixed in some fresh blueberries as they are good with lemon as well. Serve with homemade sweetened whipped cream and WOW! what a treat.",
