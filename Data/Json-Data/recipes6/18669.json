I used less onion than called for, and I used fresh shiitake mushrooms.  I also cubed the chicken instead of cutting it into strips, just personal preference.  Also, I substituted 1 Tbsp mirin for soy in the sauce, and I added a pat of butter to the sauce (a trick I learned from the cooks where I work) and it was delicious!  Also needed to cover the pan while the eggs were cooking, so the sauce did not evaporate too much.",

And for a twist replace the green onion with cilantro gives it a even more refreshing taste! Also instead of chicken broth I used water and bonito powder for the broth. Regular white mushroom also works great in it if you don't have shitake in hand.",

I would recommend slicing the chicken into thin strips and marinating it in about 1 Tbs cornstarch, 1 Tbs soy sauce, and 1 Tbs sesame oil (all approximations...) at least 30 minutes prior to cooking.  This adds flavor and makes the chicken more tender.    Instead of simmering the egg, I tried cracking an egg over each bowl of hot rice like they do in the restaurants.  But I think you need a special clay pot to make that work, because my egg never cooked and I ended up microwaving my bowl in fears of salmonella...yeah....not ideal.  So follow the directions for simmering the egg in the recipe :).",
