This so far is the closest I have found with decent measurements.  Initially it was too heavy on the soy taste, and so altered the recipe as follows:  used 1 tsp bottled lemon juice, used rice vinegar (but white would be fine), added sugar to total 2 tsps., and added 1 tablesspoon of mirin (japanese rice wine, although I think adding a little water to dilute would be ok).  I also used a white onion as yellow is sometimes too strong.  Fresh ginger is key, as well as a good smooth puree.  This is the closest I have come to duplicating the restaruant's version.",

I did use this as a marinade for salmon...could have doubled the recipe to have fresh to pour over. I didn't measure the ginger exactly but it could have used more. Maybe a little less soy sauce. Got 2 compliments from my mom and husband on the flavor. Will make this again with more ginger and try it with chicken too.",
