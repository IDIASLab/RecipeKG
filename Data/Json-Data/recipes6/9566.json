If you are a cinnamon fanatic, you have to give this recipe a try. This cake has just the right amount of cinnamon flavor and is so soft, moist, and fluffy. You can kick it up a notch and add walnuts or pecans, or better yet, a crumb topping. You can drizzle with simple syrup or glaze or dust with powdered sugar.",

Also , I used soured milk for buttermilk. You need to check on the cake after 35 or 40 minutes, my cake was little overdone in the 45 minutes baking time stated in the directions.",
