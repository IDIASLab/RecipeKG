I also used three bananas and most of a 20 oz can of pineapple, because the point of making this recipe was to use them up.  One modification I highly recommend is using the drained off pineapple juice for cooking the oatmeal, it adds natural sweetness and gives it a kick.  The muffins needed to cook for longer than indicated, closer to 35 or 40 minutes.",

I used skim milk instead of coconut and upped the extract to a full teaspoon to try to balance that I used upwards of 1/2 teaspoon I'd say of fresh grated nutmeg used about 12 ounces of pineapple and used brown sugar instead of white because I just like brown sugar. My muffins looked gorgeous in the oven but then fell flat once I pulled them out. They were browned on top but kind of raw on the inside too. I don't know if that will fix itself overnight but the flavor isn't bad. It's a bunch of mild flavors coming at you but they don't all hit you at once...they're nice. I think I'll like them more if they firm up and aren't so soggy. Dates would be AMAZING in here.",
