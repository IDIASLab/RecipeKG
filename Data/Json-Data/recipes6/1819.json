My mother's recipe for butter tarts does the same thing with currants. This recipe was easy to put together, and the result is so good. It almost has a caramel undertone. I did have to bake for an additional 10 minutes to get to the bubbling point, but that could be my oven. Thanks for the great recipe!",
