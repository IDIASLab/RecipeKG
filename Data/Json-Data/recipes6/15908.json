This is such a delicious version and for our friends who have an egg allergy this is perfect for dessert in a martini glass served with a cinnamon stick and an orange wedge (or an orange wheel if you know what that is). If you don't have a large-enough double boiler do it over a low/med flame and stir every 2-4 minutes; more toward the end as it thickens you'll need to prevent it from sticking to your pot. Also if you don't have a DB use a heavy-bottomed (not the pressed aluminum) pan. This is to ensure that your pudding comes out instead of burning in a ring on the bottm of your pan. I do give this a 5 for ease flavor and not heating up my house in the summer.:)",
