I doubled the jam to increase the mango flavor but that made it sweet like a dessert and still didn't offer much mango flavor. The shallots were a much needed balance of flavor but I didn't love the how strong the raw shallots were. I will try this again and next time: 1. Reduce sauce by half because as is it yields way too much. 2. Experiment with some seasoning in the bread crumbs and/or sauce to enhance flavor 3. Saut\u00e9 the shallots.",
