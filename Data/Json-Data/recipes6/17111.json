I baked a batch yesterday, and it didn't last a day, so I baked another today. Also I used 1 whole egg instead of two yolks and used strawberry jam. Delicious, thanks for the recipe!",

Massage slightly to get lumps out. Make a small snip in the bottom of the bag so you can squeeze out the jam into the holes in the dough. I used seedless blackberry jam..great choice!! I topped baked cookies with a coat of sifted powdered sugar. I'm going to always double this recipe. They are gone before they're cooled!!",

The powdered sugar melts into the jam, so it looks like there is powdered sugar only on the cookie part. Otherwise, I followed it by the recipe. Make sure not to overfill them with jam (this is what I did the first time,... and they overflowed onto the cookie sheet).Make the hole deep enough to actually hold some jam. GREAT RECIPE!",

It looks like a lot of bakers are making simple mistakes that ruin what should be a wonderful cookie. \n\nBLAND COOKIES - You may have used the wrong butter. I know the recipe just says \"butter\", but unless a recipe specifies unsalted, assume it means salted. Beyond that, you need to understand that this is a butter cookie. It's not meant to be very overly sweet. For the best tasting cookie, use high quality butter and jam. The quality of your butter can make a big difference. \n\nFLAT COOKIES - Your dough is too warm. Chill for half an hour to an hour before baking. The other possibility here is that you've used margarine. Margarine is not butter. \n\nDRY CRUMBLY COOKIE - You've probably overworked the dough. This can happen if your butter is too cold when you begin. \n\nBROKEN COOKIES, LEAKING JAM - You're making the wells too deep or overfilling them. Try using the back of a half teaspoon to make the indentations and fill with a bit less jam.",

The cookies do not taste like quick and easy ones though...they are soft and yummy. I hope to pass this down as a traditional cookie in my family. It did take the full 10 minutes to bake; 8 wasn't long enough and they do not look done even then because they are a very light color...only the bottoms brown well. We used peach preserves...you could use any kind! Thank you for the great recipe!",
