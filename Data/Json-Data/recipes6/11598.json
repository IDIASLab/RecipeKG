Use pineapple tibits the chunks are a little big and the crushed is not quite right either. I always use extra sharp cheddar. It's always great. Always use the brand name Ritz crackers. The topping is a significant part of the flavor combo and you can tell the difference with store brand crackers. I have taken this to potlucks but it's not very eye catching and may not get eaten because it is hard to identify on sight. One reviewer suggested marischino cherries. I love that idea and it adds the needed color and you know right away it's not scalloped potatoes! It is sweet so not a side dish that you would make often but really good for a change of pace.",

Makes a unique potluck idea: there won't be duplicates!! Good idea to mix first flour & butter then add sugar & juice then pineapples and last fold in cheese - nice smooth texture this way. (Though I've also mixed it all right in the casserole for a super quick dish! Never had a problem that way either!) By the way it only serves four in this house!;) I would double it to share.",
