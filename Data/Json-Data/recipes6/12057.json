Since the name of the recipe says \"Chocolate Chip\" I thought the chips would remain intact.  The first time I made this, the chips all melted.  The second time I decided to try something different and did not add the chips with the cereal.  I took about half of the cereal mixture, patted it into the pan and allowed it to cool for a while.  Then I sprinkled the chocolate chips (actually, more like a cup and a half) over the cereal mixture and topped it with the remaining cereal mixture.  The chips melted a bit, but the chocolate remained in a layer in the middle of the bars.  Either way, these are delicious, and easy to make for a quick treat.  I took them for a snack after a meeting last night and everyone commented on how good they were.  At one point someone asked if I'd noticed that everyone was eating them and ignoring the other snacks. A winner.",

I also stored them covered overnight, maybe that's why mine were still soft the next day?  I followed the recipe exactly, using both chunky and creamy peanut butter.  I followed another suggestion of spinkling the chocolate chips between two layers of the rice cereal mixture to keep the chocolate from melting.  These were a HUGE HIT!  Thanks!",
