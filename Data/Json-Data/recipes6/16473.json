I baked it in the evening, cooled it for about an hour before refrigerating it and served it the next day.  The result - a rich, creamy and delicious homemade cheesecake - the best I've ever had.

After reading some of the reviews I did decide to decrease the amount of chocolate chips (probably ended up being somewhere between 1/2 - 1/3 cup). I also did not have a full sleeve of graham crackers so ended up substituting crushed vanilla wafers. Otherwise I followed the recipe as it was written. It turned out great! I wanted to sample a piece in the worst way when I pulled the cheesecake out of the oven after 50 minutes. But I did wait. Everyone loved the cheesecake though I think my husband will probably drizzle some of his homemade dark chocolate sauce over the top of his next piece.",
