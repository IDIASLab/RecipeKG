I made rice and fresh wontons to go with it (I used the recipe inside of the wonton wrapper to make them). There's definitely no need to add salt to this as it's pretty sodium-rich (maybe it was the splash of soy). My Mom gave me some asian cooking tips as she was over: Stir fry is done at very high eat so crank it up. Cook the beef first then remove it. Add the veggies (no more oil) and about 1/4 cup of water and put a lid on it. About a minute later return the beef to the pan and created an opening in the center of the pan. Pour the sauce in there and stir it around in the middle until it's translucency changes (about 1 minute). Combine all ingredients and serve. My husband said that this was restaurant quality and perhaps the best broccoli beef he's ever had!",

I used red wine (merlot) instead of sherry and added 2 T of this garlic-ginger stir fry sauce I found at the store. Next time I will either add more of this sauce or use fresh ginger to get that great flavor. I also added broccoli. I wasn't too big on the flank steak...way too fatty and therefor chewy. Next time I will use a lean cut of meat and also add a lot more green onions and perhaps some shallots as well. I couldn't taste the onion at all. Also although I liked the flavor of the peanut oil I may try olive oil (or a mixture of the two) next time as it was the flavor that stood out the most to me...but I would like to be able to taste it all! All-in-all I really enjoyed it and am excited to do some more stirfying!:)",

I followed the recommendations: double the sauce (still wasn't enough for me so I wound up whipping up some more right after adding the sauce and veggies to the meat then adding that also) add a TBS soy (per serving of sauce). I didn't have dry sherry so I used sherry cooking wine I had on hand (and added 1TBS beef broth per sauce serving just because I had a bit left over in the fridge). I added about 3 cups broccoli florets and about 10 or so baby carrots cut in quarters lengthwise. Last but not least I added 2 cloves garlic and about a quarter of an onion both thinly sliced. I will add more green onions next time. Besides the time it takes to cut the veggies this is a SUPER FAST AND DELICIOUS meal! Tasted like we'd ordered out! I served over white rice. Enjoy!!!",
