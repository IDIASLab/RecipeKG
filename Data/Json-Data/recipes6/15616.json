Since there have been no other reviews until mine I'm assuming her three star revies has kept others from trying it.  Well here's a completely positive review! The pudding was fantastic and still is, I'm gulping it down as I write.  It's rich and you can't even tell there's no dairy!  Great for Vegans like me and even for you Dairy Lovers out there!  There's no difference in aste or texture between this recipe and your typical chocolate pudding recipe except this is better.  I'll never even consider store bought again!  To prevent the corn starch from clumping once added to the hot mixture you just need to make sure that the corn startch and water mixture are completely stirred together with no globs of corn startch left, it needs to be completely smooth.  If that part is done correctly, and it's not hard, there will be no clumping.  The only other way that cornstartch will clump is when it's added directly to a hot mixture, so always mix it first with a liquid until smooth or add cornstarch directly to what ever you're making, but make sure the mix you are adding it to is cold or cool.  Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this again and again!",

I read the reviews first and made a few changes:  First, I used chocolate soy milk instead of normal because that's what I already had in the refrigerator, and I added 1/3 a cup of sugar because some people had said it was bitter.  I also put in some cinnamon because I like cinnamon.  I put it all in the food processor and gave it a whirl to get the cocoa mixed in, I think maybe that step should be added to the directions!  That kept the texture perfectly smooth, and like some others have said, make sure that the cornstarch and cold water are completely mixed up before you add it to the rest of the stuff.  Next time, I'm going to add a little less cornstarch and more sugar, then I think it will be perfect :o)",
