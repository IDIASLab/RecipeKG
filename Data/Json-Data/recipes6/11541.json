It isn't white looks more like a yellow cake and not at all like the cake mix cakes. Maybe because of using baking soda instead of baking powder? Anyway I frosted with Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate cocoa frosting. VERY tasty! Not sure why but it needed an additional ten minutes to bake...no problem though.",
