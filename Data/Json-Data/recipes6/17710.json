I think it needs either less shortening or more flour. I thought with the amount of baking powder called for it would be a \"puffier\" cookie.\r\nAlso my oven is right on as far as temperature goes and I had to add at least 5 more minutes to the cooking time in order to get cookies that were even remotely done.\r\nOn the positive side, the large amount of extract makes the cookies very flavorable.\r\nAs I said, with some adjustments this recipe have good potential.",

They are sweet but I don't think too sweet. You could always cut back on the sugar if you want. I would add 1/4 cup more flour next time since I live at high altitude. They would be great with different extracts. I would love to try lemon or orange. I used a tablespoon sized scoop and had to cook them about 12 minutes. I do think these cookies would be too sweet with a glaze on top using the sugar or sprinkles was perfect for me. I can't stop eating them! EDITED 6 hrs after initial review to change from 4 to 5 stars. I can't stop eating these they really are very very good. I will have to make them again in a few days.",

Besides my children said they preferred a softer cookie. My daughter took one bite and said 'Now this is what a sugar cookie should taste like'. Instead of rolling them into balls I used a scoop which wasn't as messy as having to roll them by hand and much quicker. I also used 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. almond extract. The only other change I would make is to decrease the sugar. Even my kids agreed it was too sweet.",

I opted not to roll the cookies in sugar instead I sprinkled either cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice over the top as they came out of the oven. Turned out perfect.
