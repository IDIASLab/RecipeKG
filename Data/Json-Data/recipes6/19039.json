I turned the pears and filled the core with the nut stuffing and baked for additional 5 minutes or so. The next time I am going to cut down on the sugar to 1 T. in the topping as it was a little too sweet for our taste. But otherwise it was a good recipe and so easy to prepare. Has a nice presentation topped with the whipped cream and a sprinkling of cinnamon. Thanks Dakota!",
