They are a soft cake-like cookie, and topped with a creamcheese or vanilla icing.  So I thought it would make an excellent cake, and much easier than the cookies since I could just dump the whole thing into a pan and bake it.  Good idea.  It was moist and full of flavour.  I doubled up on the spices since my husband loves spice cakes so much.  This is a winner, with or without icing.",

The only difference in my mom's recipe was she added a cup of chopped pecans that had been floured (so they wouldn't sink to the bottom) gently stirring them in at the last before pouring into the pan for baking. (She made hers in a tube pan.) Also something else my mom did was she would start this the night before. She would cool the shortening/raisins/water/sugar mixture with a lid on the pan overnight. (She did this on top of our washing machine in the garage!) The next morning she would spoon most of the hardened shortening off and then proceed with the making the cake. Thanks so much for posting!

My mom LOVED this cake unfortunately it was not to my liking (so my mom ended up eating the majority of it). The texture was really nice and moist. If I was growing up during the depression and eating ketchup and mayo sandwiches like my grandmother and great-aunt did I probably would have thought this was such an amazing treat however my spoiled taste buds ruined this for me. Thank you for this recipe though it was really cool to make! Very ingenious for containing no milk eggs or butter!",
