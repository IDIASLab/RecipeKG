I think she was expecting my usual quinoa salad she had no idea she was in for a lovely dressing with what she described as an added sweetness the asparagus and feta paired so nicely with the dressing I wish we could have included the crunch from the toasted almonds but due to allergy had to omit. This is a definite keeper for us Thanks anninlondon.",
