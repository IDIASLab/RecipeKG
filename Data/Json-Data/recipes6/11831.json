I think if some people are experiencing problems with this not turning out firmer it could be the type of apple they are using. Granny Smith are known to keep their shape when cooked or baked, whereas a macintosh or cortland are going to cook down quite a bit. It all depends what kind of apple you prefer to work with. We like the macintosh here so I don't mind if the bars don't come out as firm, the flavor we enjoy is there. Give it a try, but keep in mind the type of apple you use will most likely affect the outcome.  Thanks for the recipe!",

My personal tastes do not like walnuts, so I sub'd half oats-half finely chopped pecans.  And I threw in a dash of nutmeg.  Just to dress it up a little, I made Luscious Buttercream Frosting (Submitted by: Land O'Lakes, Inc.) from this website and served it along side so people could use their desired amount.  Admittedly, I was concerned the frosting would be too rich for such a rustic bar, but they both balanced each other out, giving an absolutely delicious dessert that everyone raved about!",

But very easy to customize to your own tastes.  I used 3 VERY large granny smith apples, chopped. (I like lots of fruit in my pies and bars!!!) I added a little more flour to supplement for the extra apples. I kept the 8x8 inch pan and sprinkled brown sugar on top, baked just over an hour. Kept them in the fridge, I love them cold.  Next time I want to make caramel sauce to go on top.",
