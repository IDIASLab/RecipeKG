After tasting it, I immediately added a generous three-finger \u201cpinch\u201d of fine salt and beat the dickens out of it. Tasted it again. Much better but still needed that little something to take it over the top. Looking through my extracts, essences, flavorings and oils, I spied my tiny bottle of Caramel flavoring. It only took 1/2 teaspoon to send this frosting \u201cTo The Moon\u201d! Oh My Gosh! Yum!",
