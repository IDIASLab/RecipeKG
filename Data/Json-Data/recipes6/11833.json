They came out flat but we really liked it that way so I will continue on making it that way. I also added 1/2 cup of coconut. Very yummy. Just be careful on the cooking time. By 8 minutes mine were already a bit too dark so it is usually good to put for 6 minutes and then check it. Very delicious. Thank you so much for sharing.",
