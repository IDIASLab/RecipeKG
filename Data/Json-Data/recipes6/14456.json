I am a novice baker and the dough has risen for me both times (i'm making it right now w/ 2c wheat flour). It's such a great recipe I would definitely recommend trying it! If the yeast is good and the water is only slightly warmer than wrist-temp it should work. Good luck!",

If you want a dark brown crust (see the pic I've uploaded for this recipe) that was for 30 minutes at 375. This last time I took it out at 26 minutes and it was not quite as dark brown (of course). Regardless of 24-30 min baking time the inside is sweet tasty and just outright delicious. Made this last week for Christmas served with butter and Crock Pot apple butter and it was flat out off the chart. Fantastic recipe.",
