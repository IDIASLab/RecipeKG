However, since I noticed the \"dense\" complaints, I added a second tsp of baking powder to ensure they were fluffy. Also, once I made the batter, I added about a tsp of Italian seasoning.  WOW! Now, they don't look or taste like dinner rolls but everyone gobbled them up just the same. Also, I stink at making breads and I accomplished these without a hitch! Thank you Glenda for the great recipe!",
