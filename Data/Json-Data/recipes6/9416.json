Added tons of fresh garlic - we are true garlic lovers.  Ten cloves or so, finely diced.  2.  Add just a little black pepper.  The pepper compliments the lime flavor nicely.  3.   Diced the meat into 1\" chunks and cooked it at very high heat to get a nice browning.  Too low of heat causes over cooking.  We did use extra olive oil in the pan to encourage browning.  The result was bite sized pork with lime and garlic flavors.  We served it with black beans and rice.  It was amazing!",

The pork loins at my store weren't looking too good so I used some thicker cut pork chops and just cut them in half (across the middle) to make \"medallions\". I also put the cumin/lime mixture(I used 2 limes and had to almost double the rest of the ingredients for 8 medallions) on the pork and let it set an hour or so in the fridge to let the flavor sink into the meat. I used a little EVOO instead of spray in the pan seared one side of the meat (one note: you need to be careful your pan is hot enough to sear the meat but not burn your garlic in the lime/cumin mixture). Flipped them and added 4 cloves chopped garlic and the juice of 2 limes I feel this makes the sauce otherwise it's just lime juice and the flavor from the pork the garlic gives it texture and amazing flavor since it mellows being cooked this way. I covered the pan after I added the lime juice because I didn't want it to just boil off before the meat cooked through. Served mine with a package of \"bird's eye\" roasted potatoes and broccoli in cheese sauce brown rice (instant cooks in the perfect amount of time for this recipe!) with a can of \"southwest\" corn black beans and red pepper. This is a super fast and easy dish with a surprising different flavor Thanks to rainyk for submitting!:)",
