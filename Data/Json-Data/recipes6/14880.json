It wasn't the prettiest (the poked holes were visible through the thin glaze) but it was one of the tastiest cake recipes I've come across. Very moist with a wonderful dark chocolate flavor laced with coffee liqueur. I used Valrhona cocoa powder 2T less butter than the recipe called for and a bit less sugar in the cake (up to 1/2 cup less). I also found that 1/2 c of Kahlua was a bit too much for the 1 c powdered sugar for the glaze and made it too watery - start with the sugar and add the liqueur to desired consistency. Enjoy!",

I also served it with some whipped cream that had a dash of Baileys in it. I like to soak the cake with the syrup - easy way to do this is put the cake back in the bundt pan when cool and poke with a knife while you pour the topping directly into the cake. I make as many holes as possible till the syrup is all gone and absorbed then put the cake (with pan) in a plastic bag and tie shut for the night. Flip the cake onto a serving dish and sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving. It will be moist and have a wonderful liquor flavor. I'll be making this again at my next party.",
