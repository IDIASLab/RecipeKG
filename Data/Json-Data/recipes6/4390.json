After the potatoes cooked in the broth, I added the tortellini right in there to cook, instead of dirting another pot (yes, I'm lazy, lol). When they were just about done, I added in the corn and 1/2 & 1/2. I thickened w/ Wondra flour instead of the flour/oil mixture. I didn't find this bland at all, we thought it was very flavorful. This was a wonderful, different soup that I will be making over and over~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Second I used milk rather than half-and-half (didn't have time to run to the store for more half-and half I didn't have enough). Other than that I kept to the recipe and absolutely loved it. It's mildly spicy but still very comforting. I enjoyed the mix of potatoes and tortellini but I can see where others may not have liked it as much. I'll be making this again for sure but maybe I'll mix the flour with water or some milk (as someone else noted the oil does come up to the top of the pot). Thanks for the recipe!",
