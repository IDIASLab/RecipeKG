This eliminates the blender step.\n2. Use more pineapple.  I used the full 8-oz can for a 1-1/2 pound roast.\n3. If you have a skillet that can go into the oven, you can both brown and bake in it, eliminating the need for the baking dish.\n4. Double the honey/dijon mustard mixture. After removing the roast from the pan, combine some or all of it with the pineapple according to your taste  preference.",

We were hoping for more of a pineapple taste so next time I'm going to cut the dijon down from 1 tablespoon to 1 teaspoon and the pepper in half as well. Also my pork loin was 4 lbs and very thick so it needed to bake for about 1 1/2 hours instead of 45 minutes. It was tender used a table knife to cut it. I spread the honey mustard sauce on the meat before baking but then blended the rest of the sauce with the pineapple before baking which worked very well.",
