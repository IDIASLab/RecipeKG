My husband even though he said it was ok ate 3 servings. He said it was too sweet but I did halve the cayenne pepper to please my 8 and 9yr old daughters and they loved it! My only suggestion is to double the sauce I've even tripled it before kept half of it separate and used it drizzled over the side dishes. Thank you for such a yummy quick and easy weekday meal. I'm going to try using my crock pot this time to cook the chicken and then maybe throw the chicken under the broiler with the glaze or just serve the glaze for dipping.",
