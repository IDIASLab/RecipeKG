This recipe used fat-free ingredients but I used full fat half&half because I had some I needed to use up and fudge-covered grahams in which I doubled the amount called for in the recipe. I also used vanilla extract this time but I intend to get vanilla bean paste for this the next time. I can only imagine how delicious this must be with real vanilla bean in it. I left my ice cream in the freezer overnight and it did harden up quite a bit but was still creamy to the taste. The graham crackers were a very nice touch. I can see so many possibilities for add-ins with this ice cream. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!",
