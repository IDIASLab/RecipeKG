My favorite is to eliminate the lemon zest and lemon extract in exchange for 1/2 tsp. almond extract.  While the cake is baking, I make a simple syrup and add sliced berries (strawberries usually) the juice of an orange and enough cold water/corn starch to thicken.  Once the berries break down, I serve this sauce over my cake.\n\nFor those of you in question whether or not you grease the pan and claim to be expert cooks:  shame on those of you who question this!  *LOL* No sponge cake or angel food cake should ever be baked in a greased pan; it won't rise like it should otherwise!  Invert your pan over a bottle, allow the cake to completely cool, then run a sharp knife around the edges and the middle part of the pan, then gently stick a finger down the side of the cake and loosen the bottom, working gently and carefully.\n\nExcellent cake, excellent recipe!",

I would definitely say using a handmixer (on the highest level) to get the whites to a stiff texture is a must! I kept the lemon extract and did not use a substitute and the cake came out perfect. In fact to get a heavier lemon flavor you could even use a tiny bit more. As it was the cake turned out the perfect consistency light flavorful and visually appealing. I'd use this recipe for a shortcake instead of an angel food cake any day. I also doubled this recipe because I was using a 9x13 rectangle pan. However it was a little more than I needed so I made a spill-over loaf.",
