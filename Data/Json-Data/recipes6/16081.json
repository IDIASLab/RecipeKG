Reduce heat to a bubbling simmer.  Do not stir again.  Simmer until it reaches a soft ball stage (238\u00b0), this will take several minutes. (Trust me,I know your thinking it will burn but it won't, this is the way fudge was cooked before marshmallow creme). Remove from heat and continue with the recipe except beat until smooth before adding cherries (quartered not halved).",

This is great fudge but this recipe is way off for butter.  I use only 1T of butter and I also add 3T of the cherry juice when adding the choc. chips and CHOPPED cherries.  Be sure the cherries are well drained. Boil for 5 minutes instead of four.  You'll get great fudge with these notes.",
