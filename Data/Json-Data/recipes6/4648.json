I also replaced the vegan margarine with unsalted butter used a Walla Walla sweet onion and vegetable broth in place of the mushroom broth. I didn't stir any milk into the soup but I drizzled heavy cream on top of it for decoration and garnished each bowl with a single fresh sage leaf. If you love sage sunchokes or mushrooms you will love this bisque. It's worth the prep and worth a try! Note: I found Jerusalem artichokes at my local Safeway they were labeled as \"Sunflower Chokes \" and were sold in the produce section in 1 lb packages. Update: To be a true bisque add the milk. It also cuts the intensity of the flavor and creates a rich creaminess which is nice. Also bisques are traditionally served in mugs or double-handled bowls on saucers:) Oh and this recipe makes more than 6 main dish servings more like 8 maybe even more (you're not meant to eat a huge bowl of this type of soup).",

I put them in the oven with the mushrooms. This was fantastic! Tasted like a wild mushroom soup. I poured in a little whipping cream at the end in the bowl to give it a swirl like in the picture. I didn't want to add it to the soup because then there is something in it that can spoil and I plan to freeze some. Will definitely be using this technique again. I thought it would be a little bland with the addition of straight water but the roasted veggies turned it into a broth of its own almost immediately.",
