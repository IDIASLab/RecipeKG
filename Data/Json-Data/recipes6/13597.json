We called ours 'Diddlees' and the ingredients were basically the same except we'd roll out the pie crust spread it with butter and sprinkle on cinnamon sugar and raisins then roll the crust up and cut it into slices. Then you bake them for 20 mins in a 350F/175C oven. I always looked forward to them whenever my mom baked a pie. They wre perfect with tea! Thanks for sharing.:-)",

Also try turning a small, oven-safe bown upside down - then roll out dough large enough to cover it & brush it with butter & sugar - put it sugar side down on the bowl & bake.  You'll end up with a sugary crusty bowl.  These are GREAT to fill with ice cream!",

My mom would make an extra pie crust just to make \"cinnamon roll\" made just like the jelly roll described, but not sliced until after it bakes and cools (reduces any mess as the sugar is sealed into the roll). Just be sure to use shortening instead of butter if you make it this way.  Shortening holds its shape much better.   I never liked pies as a child but I sure loved this cinnamon sugar treat.  I just never knew so many others also had such great Mom's.",
