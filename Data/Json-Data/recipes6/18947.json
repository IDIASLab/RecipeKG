Instead of bread I topped it with polenta - I just bought the sort of pre-made polenta in a tube then sliced it and layered it on top of the bean and vegetable mixture. The polenta browned up nicely in the oven and it was great. My boyfriend is a vegetarian so I'm always on the lookout for recipes that we'll both enjoy. This one was hearty and savory and we loved it. I think the spices could also be easily altered to make it a \"southwestern\" bean casserole - next time I'll try chili powder and cumin and top it with cornbread mix. Wonderful!",
