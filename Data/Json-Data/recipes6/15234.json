Please, people, do make the recommended adjustments and I promise you will not be disappointed!\r\n\r\nI diced the apples and coated them with cinnamon/sugar.  I baked the dumplings on one side for 20 minutes.  Then I turned them and baked for another 10 minutes before adding the sauce.  I made up the sauce minus the water and had to add just a tablespoon or so to get it the right consistency.  I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and ended up with this beautiful caramel sauce.  I added the sauce the last 10 minutes of cooking and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \r\n\r\nI had people begging me for the recipe and I have made it twice this week.  My husband has requested that this be THE dessert for Thanksgiving dinner and I will be only to happy to oblige.  Folks, it really is awesome!",

If you want this recipe to work, please be sure to read these reviews and consider the other reviewers' advice! 1) Dice or cut your apples into slices, 2) Add cinnamon/sugar to the cut apples (so it'll taste like a dessert, and not just an apple wrapped in a biscuit), 3) Use a smaller amount of liquid, or add the liquid in small amounts throughout the cooking time (don't dump it in all at once or you'll get a soggy mess!), and 4) Cook each dumpling for a few minutes on one (or both) sides before adding liquid to keep the sogginess to a minimum. If you follow those suggestions, you'll have better luck than if you use the recipe as is.",

And I baked for about 5 minutes before adding the liquid mixture and I used half brown sugar half white sugar.  These were sooooooooooooooooooooooo good.  You must eat it with vanilla ice cream.

I also eliminated the water as suggested by other reviews and added 1/2 cup pecans to the sauce (note: the pecans taste wonderful with this but add considerable work to washing the dish... it was worth it!)
