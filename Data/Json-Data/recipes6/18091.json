In my family we used ground beef and cook it before rolling it.  While the beef is cooking add your seasonings depending on what you like, we add garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  When the meat is cooked add frozen mixed vegetables (or fresh veggies what ever you prefer)and whatever else you'd like.  Just cook long enough to let the water and oil on the bottom cook away.  We add teriyaki sauce for more flavor and then let cool.  If you try to roll right away the wrappers will break.  Once you've rolled the lumpia you can either freeze them for another day or cook 'em in oil until golden brown.  Remember the meat inside is already cooked so all you have to do is brown them.  Also with the wrapper, a lot of people have said they've had a hard time with wrappers breaking, my suggestion is to use the square lumpia wrappers because they tend to be a little thicker than the round once.  You also don't have to wait until the wrapper is completely defrosted, as long as you can work with it you can start rolling right away.  I also use a beaten egg to try to keep the seam closed",

May I suggest frying them in a shallow layer of oil instead of fully immersing them, to keep the inside ingredients from getting overly oily.  \r\n\r\nI found banana ketchup labeled \"banana sauce\" in a Philipino grocery store.  For those who have not tasted it, it's basically a sweet & sour & hot (or mild) mix of banana and cayenne pepper.  It looks just like ketchup but it has no actual ketchup in it.  It tastes better than you would think on lumpias.  My son and I liked it so much we tried it on everything else we could think of, just to taste.",

The easiness level depends on your deftness with the wrappers but don't let it sway you away from trying this. They omit the beef and green pepper and add celery and water chestnuts for crunchiness. To help the filling stick together they add oyster sauce which really gives it a great flavor. It is served with a spicy sweet and sour sauce that I am trying to get the recipe for but your favorite from the store will due. I have never heard of or seen the banana ketchup but I will be asking!",

Reason why was because 2 tbsp of filling is WAY too much and it also needs some seasonings added. Today with the leftover meat I added freshly ground pepper and Worcestershire sauce to taste and browned the meat and vegetables. Then I only put 1 tbsp filling into the wrapper and used less oil to cook them in they came out the right size and cooked through and much better tasting.",
