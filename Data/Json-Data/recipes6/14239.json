We divided the taffy before adding the extracts; we made maple mint and vanilla. Maple tastes like butterscotch. I think we pulled the taffy too long because it was very hard to chew- it actually pulled out someone's metal filling. We 1/2ed the salt omitted the food coloring and almonds it tasted great!",

A sure fired way to get the taffy to the finished consitancy is to drop a drop of the hod liquid into a cold cup of water and then check if it is soft crack or hard crack or what ever your consistancy you desire. My Mother and Grandmother taught me this. they never needed a thermometer",
