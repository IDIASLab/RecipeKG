I lived in \"da Burgh\" for 11 years and missed the slaw. I used 2 (16 oz.) bags of Tri Blend Slaw. Primanti Brothers only uses white cabbage, no carrots or red cabbage that you find in the tri blend. I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup. Yea, this was a little watery but what slaw isn't? I just shook the tupperware bowl prior to serving and used a slotted spoon. Oh, you really need to make this the day PRIOR to eating; it really makes a difference in taste. This is so wonderful, I will be making and taking this everywhere. Not only is it delicious but you don't have to worry about mayonnaise going bad! Thanks for the post Christina!!!",

It is meant to be immersed in the marinade in the refrigerator and removed with a slotted spoon and drained in a mesh strainer before serving. It will keep from 4-6 weeks in its marinade in a cold part of the fridge (if it lasts that long). It does improve with age, becoming more of a condiment-like pickled cabbage than a slaw or salad. In my family it was the indispensible accompaniment to meals with barbecue pork and chicken and for pulled pork or chicken sandwiches. My recipe calls for sprinkling the cabbage and onion layers with 3/4 c. sugar, making a hot marinade (brought to a full boil) with 1/4 c. sugar, dry mustard, 1 c. organic apple cider vinegar, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 tablespoon of celery seed, and 3/4 c. oil, and then poured over the cabbage mixture, which is covered, and allowed to sit out till cools (about 2-3 hours). Then it is placed, with all of the liquid, in a very clean glass container with a tightly fitting glass lid, and stored in a very cold part of the fridge. Keeps for 4-6 weeks.",

I don't understand why it is necessary to cook the dressing portion of this recipe--and after boiling that portion of the recipe takes a long time to cool down. Still I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was great. I did end up with more liquid than was necessary. I added extra cabbage but don't recommend that approach. Adding more cabbage diluted and dispersed the wonderful flavor of the dressing. Just leave it alone and use a slotted spoon to drain it as you go with each spoonful you take.",
