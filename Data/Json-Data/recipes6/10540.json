The muffins are very sugary tasting, bland, and lacking in chocolate flavor.  Fudgy was definitely the wrong adjective to use in the name, because there is nothing fudge-like about them.  I was expecting something more rich and flavorful.  Definitely one of the worst chocolate-chocolate chip muffins I've ever tasted.  I won't be making these again.",

I gave it a 5 star for the flavor and I will work on figuring out how to make it more moist without compromising the flavor. I did omit the cinnamon and I substitued 1/2 c. sour cream for the applesauce as I had none on hand. I also added a dash of salt. These are way better than the box muffins I have been making to send to work with my husband. Thanks! 4/29/07 - made this muffins again and this time used the applesauce called for instead of sour cream I had subbed before. I also increased the margarine to 1/2 c. and added some milk (probably 1/4 c.) and they were nice and moist. Yummy!",

                "reviewBody": "These muffins turned out fantastically! I did change things up a bit though. I doubled the recipe and came out with 18 muffins not 24. I also used cinnamon applesauce and omitted the extra cinnamon I felt that this was a good compromise. I also realized that I was out of butter so I used olive oil spread and noticed no issues with it. I was also out of chocolate chips! So I finely chopped up some other chocolates I had lying around and it actually added a little bit of fudginess. Since I was low on chocolate I compensated by adding a little bit more cocoa powder. Some baking tips: I suggest using a spring-action ice cream scoop to distribute the batter into the muffin tins it is even and a lot less messy. I also sprinkled white sugar on the tops of each muffin before baking for a slight crunch on the tops. I baked these for 24 minutes and they were perfect! Let them cool for about a minute in the tin and if you do not want to eat them right away cool them the rest of the way out of the tin on wire racks. What a great recipe.",

Anyway here is my take as I normally try to cut back on the \"bad\" parts of most recipes (sugar and salt). 1) I used Milk chocolate chips in place of anything else for a slightly smoother creamy taste. So much better I find - as do my \"food fans\". When I do this I find you can omit 1/4 of the sugar - always a bonus for me. 2) I also skipped the cinnamon and I filled the cups almost all the way - not 3/4 of the way like it says. They don't rise very much....for me anyway. Enjoy!",

I bake using applesauce instead of oil all the time (although this is my first attempt at using it with chocolate) and it gave these kind of an odd scent and flavor at first. Still good I thought with the increased cocoa they were very fudgy. I also added a pinch of salt and only 1/2 c of mini choco chip (they don't sink).",
