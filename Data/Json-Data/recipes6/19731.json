So I went ahead and used the water because I didn't want to make a special trip to the store just for that ingredient. I am SO glad I didn't because it didn't need it! The soup was wonderful and flavorful. Some reviews said it was bland but I beg to differ! Also some said the ginger flavor was too over powering. I, again, disagree! I followed the recipe exactly and I am so glad I did! No changes necessary on this one! Thanks for the recipe. I will make it again for sure!",

For those who found it lacking in flavour make sure that the ingredients used are of highest quality -- organic fully ripened rich in colour -- and the difference should be noticable. I must say I liked the thickness which is easily adjusted for different occasions. A variation I tried and liked: simmer the squash intead of baking it and add the cooking liquid to the soup instead of plain water; add 2 cups thoroughly cooked red split lentels; add a dash of nutmeg and a dash of gharam masala; and a touch of fresh lemon zest.",

To enrich the soup use clarified butter instead of evoo and use quality chicken stock instead of water.  To mellow out the ginger, try leaving it in large slices and then removing about half before the final puree.  I've taken to using white pepper instead of black, this adds to the flavor and appearance - no little black specs floating around.  I've also increased the cinnamon but . . . add slowly and stir well to bring the flavor up.  It should be a quiet after thought on the palate not the first introduction.   ",
