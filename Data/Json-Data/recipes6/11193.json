I'm puzzled why this recipe calls for butter extract and not vanilla extract. The frosting is okay -and perfectly acceptable on a carrot cake or spice cake but after years of reviewing red velvet cakes it is a fact that the only frosting that should even be used is a Butter roux frosting (similiar to a butter cream frosting but the butter roux frosting is a cooked frosting) I appreciate your sharing the recipe but I will not be making this cake ever again.",

I didn't sift the flour though, and it didn't seem to present a problem. The only other tip I have was that you HAVE to mix the 2nd part of ingredients in a separate bowl. I tried it out twice and the 1st time, I just added the vinegar, baking soda, ect to the already mixed ingredents and it started fizzing and popping like a science fair project. (I was trying to be quick and make less of a mess and wasn't thinking!) Anyway, it turned out good, but the 2nd time I made them they were even better! I took them to work and they were inhaled. They were very moist and the frosting recipe is a winner also, I will no longer buy store bought frosting!! Thanks for the great recipe, I am in IL, I am not sure why so many people had difficulties with this, it's AWESOME!!",
