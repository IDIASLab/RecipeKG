I pretty much followed the recipe using a supermarket pack of 2 carrots 1 big parsnip 1/2 a small leek 1 small celery stick 1 small turnip a lot of parsley and 1 sprig of dill. I added 1/2 a sweet onion. I sauteed everything but the herbs in olive oil for a few minutes before adding the pumpkin (1/2 a can) and the vegetable stock. I added salt pepper and dried cilantro to taste and simmered for about 45-50 min. covered. I then blended with an emersion blender. I made the garnish separately and included the dill which I had also chopped. I eyeballed the paprika and probably used much more than 1/8 tsp. Instead of adding the garnish to our bowls I added it into the soup since we ate 1/2 of it and will have the rest another day. I will definitely be making this soup again and again. It is very warming and filling so it is great for winter. I recommend the recipe highly.",
