I used 2 cups of boiled and pureed beets (instead of canned), added 1/2 tsp nutmeg amd 1 tsp vanilla, and substituted 1 c apple sauce for 1 c of the oil (reducing the oil in the recipe to 1/2 cup).  I spooned the batter into greased muffin pans, and baked at 350 for about 25 minutes.  The muffins (or cupcakes) turned out moist and delicious, and my kids loved them.  I must say that I was excited about the vivid magenta batter, but in the end, the muffins only had a tinge of red on top - the insides were a typical carrot cake colour.  What a great way to use some excess beets and carrots, and sneak more veggies into my kids!",

I think the cake would be a lot better with the following changes: more sugar less cinnamon plus other spices (maybe nutmeg and allspice) and vanilla extract. Some grated orange peel would be good too. If you are using raw beets like I did I would reduce beets and increase carrots. The beet flavor was dominant in mine.",
