I started off with 12 pieces country white bread and cut off the crusts(I tend not to like the crust) then cubed and mixed with melted butter and 11/2tbsp cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg for better flavor. I skipped the raisins because I didn't want in my dish but you could add diced apples as well.(if you do add raisins I would soak for 8min in boiling water or apples in the melted butter to soften) For the milk I did- 1 1/2 cup milk and 1 1/2 cup heavy cream for a richer flavor.  I followed the rest and I did use a 2quart baking dish but I rested it in a 13X9 inch dish filled 1/3 with warm water to bake (read it makes a a little more custard like opposed to mushy).  I baked for like 40-45 minutes to let the top get that little crunch.   Out of the oven I ate a third-it was so good!  the rest of the family finished it off.  Will have to make again real soon!",

                "reviewBody": "This bread pudding *really is* a winner! I had never made bread pudding before but spent time reading all the many reviews and revised the recipe accordingly. I cut the crusts off 12 slices white bread and then cut each slice into 16 squares. I used butter instead of margarine, which I melted and blended with the liquid ingredients rather than the dry bread cubes. I softened the raisins by briefly soaking them in boiling water (about 10 min.) I tossed the bread and raisins together with 1 TABLESPOON ground cinnamon (could probably have used 2 tablespoons, even!)I topped the pudding with 3 pinches of nutmeg, also as suggested. The 6 eggs were just fine to use, next time I may use 1/2 milk and 1/2 light cream and maybe a tablespoon of rum or cognac. Baking temperature of 375 degrees F was OK but as I used a 2 quart Pyrex casserole dish measuring 9\" top diameter, 7\" bottom diameter and 3\" deep and set the casserole dish into a 9\" x 13\" x 2\" metal baking pan filled with water, baking time was more like an hour to an hour and a half. Nevertheless, my very BRITISH boyfriend nearly shrieked with delight when he arrived home to find this bread pudding in the works. However, according to him, this would be classified as Bread & Butter Pudding. Who cares? He snarfed it down au naturel without any embellishments and was licking his eyebrows afterwards. Mission Accomplished!",

Because I wasn't using white bread that came in slices I couldn't follow the recipe exactly. I cut the bread into slices and then cubes giving me maybe 3 cups (I have no idea just guessing). I did the rest basically by eye though I did use exactly 3 cups of milk and 5 eggs (reviewers said 6 was a bit much). When I tipped the dish after 25 mins liquid still escaped so I baked it for an extra 10 minutes. It tastes very good! I've never made bread pudding before and this was super-easy.",

Lesson Learned. :) Anyway, WOW! As great as I had hoped and anticipated, a fantastic, cozy treat on an Autumn morn. Could not get much easier than this. I can't wait to teach my kids to make this.
