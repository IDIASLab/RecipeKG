Every time I make them they are well-received; not only delicious, but conversation pieces as well!  They make plain old scrambled eggs a little more special and a little more festive.  (In fact, I\u2019m thinking these just may be part of my Christmas breakfast menu when my whole gang comes home for Christmas) There are as many variations as there are ingredients you can think of to put in them!  Chopped zucchini, broccoli, mushrooms, shredded cheese, bacon \u2013 all would be delicious.  I adjusted the ingredients in this recipe to suit my tastes \u2013 for half a recipe, 4 eggs, I used 1/ 2 cup ham, about 2 T. each of finely diced red pepper and red onion, fresh minced chives, and about 2/3 shredded cheddar cheese.  I also added a splash of milk. What\u2019s important, I think, is to finely chop your vegetables to make sure they cook through in this brief cooking time and to make sure the muffin cups are filled almost to the top.  I used silicone cups sprayed with Pam, and filled them with a 1/4 cup measuring cup.  A four egg recipe, given the additions and proportions of ingredients I chose to use, made six muffins.  I baked them just till set and not wet looking, about 22 minutes.  A teeny dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of minced red pepper and fresh chives dressed them up real pretty.",

Great to reheat in the morning for a quick and healthy breakfast.. Followed the recipes modifications outlined in Naples 34102 review (you clan NEVER go wrong following her feedback!). Added a little more than 1/3 cup each of finely chopped red pepper and onion, along with a Cup of finely chopped ham and roughly one cup shredded cheese to the 8 eggs.  Added a splash of milk, filled using a 1/4 measuring cup. It made 17 reasonably-sized muffins using lightly greased (using non-stick spray) silicone muffin cups (these things are awesome, easy to clean & nothing sticks).   The possibilities are endless with this recipe...thanks for sharing Becki!!!",
