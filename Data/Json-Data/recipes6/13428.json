If anyone else is lost and is using a top pie crust as well, this is what I did: 1. I laid a 9inch pre-made Pillsbury pie crust in a glass pie pan, baked it at 350 degrees for 10 minutes BEFORE EVERYTHING. 2. Pulled it out of the oven and poured a box of blueberries in the semi-baked shell. 3. Combined the rest of the ingredients in a sauce pan, including the remaining 2pints of blueberries. 3. Cooked it for lower heat until the sauce pan was high in blueberry sauce. You can add cinnamon or vanilla if you want. 4. Poured it on top of the uncooked blueberries in the pie, added a top criss-cross pie layer and baked it at 450 for about 11-13 minutes. ",

The second time I tried it I made some changes: added 1/4t each vanilla and almond extract, and 1/8t cinnamon (will up it to 1/4t next time to try that).  I changed the ratio of berries to 1 1/2C fresh and 2 1/2C cooked.  I found 1/3C sugar worked well when serving the pie with ice cream.  I look forward to making this pie because it's such a treat.

I bought 2 bottom crusts and used one as the top crust. I modified the recipe by adding in some strawberries and cinnamon. I baked the bottom crust for about 10 minutes and set aside to cool. I cooked the pie filling using 2 cups of frozen blueberries (thawed rinsed and drained) and 1 cup of fresh sliced strawberries. I followed recipe exactly except for adding in 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. I put the fresh blueberries into the bottom crust then poured the cooked filling on top put on the top crust and baked for another 15 minutes until browned. I served it with whipped cream. It was delicious! My daughter who claimed she didn't like pie gobbled up a whole piece! I chose this recipe because it didn't use cornstarch. The filling tasted very fresh and the fresh blueberries were still firm and just popped in your mouth. Next time I think I'll reduce the sugar just a bit and I might even try my hand at making my own pie crust. Thanks for an awesome recipe!",

I never liked the overly-sweet pudding-consistency texture of pies and this was not too sweet nor too gooey. I loved actually tasting the blueberry. Ate it with vanilla ice cream and it was too delicious for words. I scarfed it down and so did my brother who usually calls my baking. He didn't even try to disguise his pleasure this time asking me to bake another one. I followed suggestions and used a teaspoon of cinnamon plus half-teaspoons of vanilla and almond extract. Now I was slightly puzzled on how to put a top-pie-crust on it. The recipe doesn't describe baking. So after I finished all the instructions I baked the pie for ten minutes at 450 degrees F - with a top lattice-strip crust. It didn't affect the rest of the pie too much. Still wonderful!",
