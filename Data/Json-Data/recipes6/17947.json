Next time after the cake has been taken out of the pan and cooled I am going to put the cake in the freezer before I cut it to make the bars. Just make it easier with the cake partially frozen. I put them in individual sandwich bags and put in the fridge so they will have snacks for the next few days for school. Thanks for the recipe!!",
