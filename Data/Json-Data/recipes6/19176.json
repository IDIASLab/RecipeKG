I'm not a novice cook or baker by any means yet my thirteen year old daughter and I went over the directions several times to see where we may have gone wrong. The topping was nothing more than thickened melted chocolate. Was the butter supposed to be right from the fridge and not room temp? Was there supposed to be beaten egg white in the topping? Anyway the kids thought it was acceptable however hubby and I thought it was way too sweet for our taste. I don't think I'll be making this again.",
