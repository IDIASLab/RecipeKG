Second I used about 1 teaspoon of celery SALT red wine vinegar instead of white 1% mild to desired consistency (didn't have heavy cream on hand) then followed recipe almost to a tee (eyed measurements). Third this recipe is perfect for a 16oz bag of slaw mix and finally my picky picky boyfriend's rave review was the icing on the cake! Perfect all the way around! Would probably make a great salad dressing as well as dipping sauce for chicken/shrimp.",

Piggy backing off previous reviews I tried a little yogurt to boost the health factor in this recipe - wouldn't do that again. My own fault. Now onto where I don't like the recipe the honey was too strong. I think the sugar would have provided adequate sweetness and the honey added a fruity sweetness I didn't like and had to temper with extra vinegar. As for the celery seed - 1 tsp was enough. Used it on Broccoli slaw.... too sweet for me can imagine it would have been worse with cabbage mix.",

One tsp was enough for me and I also used fat free half & half (had no cream on hand) and a good spicy dijon. Between that and the horseradish it had quite a kick!! Loved it! I was serving this for guests but next time will replace most - if not all - of the mayo with nonfat yogurt as I plan on making this often. I also like to use both green and red cabbage to make it colorful.",
