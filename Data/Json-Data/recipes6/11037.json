I used a standard brownie mix made according to package directions, baking it in a 10\" spring form pan well coated with Pam. I baked the brownie layer for 15 to 20 minutes then sprinkled the edges with some chopped pecans to prevent the caramel layer from leaking out. I sprinkled white chocolate chips over the baked brownie crust before I spread the caramel layer on. I took the advice of others and used 3 pkg.  of cream cheese, 3/4 c sugar and  3 eggs. I baked the cheesecake layer for 50 minutes. I had no problems getting it out of the pan and it was not hard to cut. It was marvelous. I decorated the top with carmel and fudge drizzles put through a pastry bag..\r\nI just made it for the second time and used the La Lechera Caramel flavor, although it is easier,  I do not think it tastes  as good as caramels w/ evaporated milk. I followed all the above steps and it baked nicely. We will \"taste\" the second creation  results on  Mother's Day.\r\nThis is definately a 5 Star recipe.  I come from a family of professional chefs and have done the baking for our restaurant for many years.",

If you do you will not be able to cut the cake! 10 minutes works fine for me. Also because this is a bit overpowering sweet, I have made the cheesecake portion 50% bigger. 3 creamcheese, 3 eggs, 3/4 cup sugar,1 1/2 vanilla. 60 minutes in the oven (check at 50 min). Everyone I have made this for, loves it!! I even made it for a bake sale, the price was $10 BUT alot of the people there have had it before and started Bidding on it. Last bid was $38, and the money went to a great cause. Enjoy!!\r\n",

So that's what I did!  Make this recipe using a large size (for 13x9) brownie mix, use La Lechera (thanks to whomever offered that suggestion.  I'd never even heard of that before.), and increase the cheesecake layer by half.  Bake brownie layer for 20 minutes before proceeding.  This turned out wonderful!  We had it for a dinner party and it was the only dessert that totally disappeared! To all of the folks who tried this recipe as written with disasterous results - try it again with these alterations and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",

I USED A PRODUCT CALLED LaLechera by Nestle (mexican food section-looks like a sweet condensed pan--Dulce de Leche) BASICALLY IT'S CARMEL SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK. SO YOU ELIMINATE THE WHOLE CARMEL PROCESS. SLIGHTLY WARM IT TO SOFTEN IT...THEN ONLY COOK THE BROWNIE 15 MIN. SPREAD THE LaLechera ONLY TO 1/2 \" FROM THE EDGE. FOLLOW THE REST OF THE DIRECTIONS.

I'm giving this recipe a one star and ONLY because I think that it hasn't been tested properly. IMO there' a MAJOR MISTAKE in this recipe. Nearly everyone's complained about the caramel running out of the cake. Here's why. 5 OUNCES OF EVAPORATED MILK IS WAY TOO MUCH. That's roughly 2/3 of a cup! No wonder it oozes out! Use 1/4 cup of evaporated milk with 14 ounces of caramels. And if adding chopped pecans add 1-1/4 cups that will also help the caramel stay put. Also I think that this recipe should just say \"9 ounces of packaged brownie mix prepare as directed on package\".... no wonder so many people have messed it up.. lol... I bet they're adding an extra egg and water to the mix!",

First I used turtle brownie mix, and baked it about 15-20 minutes, just so it looked almost done but not quite. I followed the suggestion of another by using 3 cream cheese, 3/4C sugar,1 1/2 t. vanilla & 3 eggs. I skipped making the caramel sauce completely because the brownie mix had it included. So I purchased a jar of milky way ice cream topping/sauce to drizzle on the top of each slice as it was served. Everyone was soooo impressed!! This turned out awsome!!",
