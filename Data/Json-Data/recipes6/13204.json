I cut back a little on the vegetable oil and added a bit of both sesame and chili oils as well as some Thai garlic chili paste. The dressing ended up tasting wonderful with just a little pop of heat from the chili paste and chili oil. The rotini I had on hand was multi-color and to brighten it even more I added a little bit of sliced red bell pepper peeled & seeded cucumber chunks and squeezed some fresh lime juice over it. The one thing I wasn't crazy about was the dry ramen noodles. I think I would prefer chopped peanuts but that just could be a personal taste preference. Overall a very nice pasta salad with good presentation. Thanks Lori for sharing with us.",
