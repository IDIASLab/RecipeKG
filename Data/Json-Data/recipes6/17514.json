HOWEVER!, I highly recommend using the fine grate on your grater, I used the regular size and it didnt look appetizing.  I told my daughter it was apple shreds or else she wouldnt have tried it and she love it.  I have left over frozen shredded zucchinni that i wil put in my chopper to make small for the next batch.  These will be a regular cookie for us.  Thank you!",
