I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I think I put in a bit more broccoli, used red wine vinegar, and I heeded the warning of others and went easy on the onion.  I found that just after I mixed it up, the onion was very strong.  I made it up the evening before I was going to use it, and the next day, the onion flavor was barely noticeable.  I ended up adding more onion.  I think that either the vinegar or the mayo chemically \"cooked\" the onion and mellowed it out.  With this salad, I would say that it's important that it sit for at least a few hours in the refrigerator before serving to let the onions settle down.",
