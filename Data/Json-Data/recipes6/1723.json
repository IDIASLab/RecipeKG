They just required a little extra time, in the microwave, over the Quaker quick oats. I didn't care for the chewier texture, but that is not the recipes fault. My issue is it didn't taste like an oatmeal cookie at all, and it wasn't quite sweet enough. I also had odd egg white bits in the oatmeal despite blending in the milk very well. I have never had a microwave oatmeal recipe call for an egg. I made Becky's baked oatmeal recently, from this site, and it may have raised the bar on hot oatmeal. That recipe also made storing leftovers with ease. Something important to me for quick and handy breakfast ideas during the week. Also, note, this recipe makes at least 2 good sized servings.",
