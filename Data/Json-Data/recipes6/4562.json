First of all if you add the sweet potatoes and parsnips so late in the process not all of them will cook all the way through. When I made it many of the chunks were still crunchy. Second file powder is an end spice - you should not add it and then simmer for 30 minutes. The result will be slimy and unappetizing as I found out when I made it. I like the ideas of the roasted peppers and the various spices but not enough to salvage it overall. Thumbs down.",

Just a word to the wise - gumbo seasoning can be very spicey so if you do not like spicey food be careful and do not add 2 whole TBSP! We served over rice.",

I left out the parsnip the celery and the black-eye peas because I don't like those. Next time I think I'll halve the kidney beans and the okra and double the green and red peppers.

I'm glad I kept them because when I opened the can of fire roasted tomatoes they didn't have any heat at all. Not sure if this is the norm. - anyway I added the seeds when the tomatoes went in. I also added a teaspoon of crushed chili flakes. Thank you so much for this recipe!!
