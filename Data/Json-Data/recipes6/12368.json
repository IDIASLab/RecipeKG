They are easy and they spread so give yourself a bit of space between cookies. The dough is more like a batter which makes me wonder if they'd be good muffins perhaps with some coconut and macadamia nuts tossed in. All in all I think I'd experiment a bit more to make them a bit better. Thanks for the recipe!",
