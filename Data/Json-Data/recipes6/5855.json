The tortilla's come out of the oven the first time nice and crispy but are soggy when the come out the second time. They taste good but I would have liked a crispy outcome. These turned out similar to Chilaquiles. If I make again I would probably use a corn tostada shell out of personal preference.",

Only thing I would do different is leave the tortillas in for less time in the beginning because when you put them in the second time to melt the cheese they get a little dark.

My husband is mostly vegan so I made his with no cheese and baked chalupa corn tortillas he really enjoyed it. My children and I added the cheese and it was great they definitely want me to make it again. I think next time I will add some green onions to the topping. I thought the shells were great baked however I did flip them and brown both sides that helped with the soggy problem.",
