It is a pretty meaty and bean chili not heavy on the tomatoes or tomato sauce for those that want more meat and bean chili. The flavor was a good balance and not spicy hot. I went ahead and added in my whole 7oz. cans of El Pato and tomato sauces and it was still a pretty thick and meaty base. I didn't have Mexican stewed tomatoes but a 10 ounce can of diced tomatoes and green chilies was perfect to give a bit more tomatoes to the brew. The only thing missing for me after I tasted it was heat. So I added in a minced jalapeno. I totally forgot the optional red wine but it was still good without it. This chili reminds me of the chili my friends in the Mid-west make the ranch beans added a great flavor. Was good on a cold night and we did top with crushed tortillas and cheddar cheese.",

It just seemed like so many of those ingredients either competed w/ the others or were just straight drowned out by the others. Definitely not saying it wasn't a good chili just not mind-blowing.
