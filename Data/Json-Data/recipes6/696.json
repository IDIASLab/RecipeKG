Just had them for dinner and they're so cute too......although it was good I'm not too fond of mustard glaze so I think I'll make something sweet next time to offset the salt in the ham...it wasn't overly salty but I think it needs something sweet to perk it up. One of the best things about them though is having no fat running through them they're just nice and tender and meaty. I think these are going on my Valentines Day menu with a raspberry brown sugar glaze and I'll cut them into heart shapes and serve two per person...the scraps will be great for pea soup. Try this recipe it's really quite good.",
