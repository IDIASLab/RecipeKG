Decorated the jar Christmas-y put it on a tray and surrounded it with baked cookies. Big hit and big seller! Tip: When decorating the jar lid with a fabric piece cut a square about 2\" larger than the lid secure it with a rubber band cover the rubber band with ribbon then trim the fabric. Save yourself the frustration of cutting a fabric circle and then trying to anchor it evenly to the lid with the rubber band! There's a whole population of lost rubber bands living in my kitchen!",
