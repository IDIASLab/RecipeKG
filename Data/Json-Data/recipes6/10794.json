Then I sifted and folded in the flour mixture rather than using the electric mixer and continued. Note that the baking time may be too long for some; mine turned out very dry at 45mins. 35mins - 40mins would have been fine... Plus it dried out too much and it seemed rather bland though my white chocolate cream filling saved it. I'll try again- with reduced baking time.",

The image made be believe that cake would be sweet moist and delicious. Mine was dry and flat. Just to note...it is probably not so much the recipe but my modifications and my baking level of expertise (low) which included: 1.5 tsp. of vanilla and a flat baking pan (not sure the size; standard size I guess). I had a piece with my whipped cream cheese frosting and was only mildly pleased. Hopefully it will taste better tomorrow after a night in the fridge. Next time if there is a next time I will use more sugar (possible powdered) and less vanilla.",
