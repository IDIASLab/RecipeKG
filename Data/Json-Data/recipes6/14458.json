I used a pound of bacon green and red onions (a little more than half of a cup) and a mixture of raisins and cherry flavored craisins (again a little more than half of a cup any combination of raisins and craisins would taste great). I omitted the celery and blanched the broccoli (placed the florets in boiling water for 30 seconds and then really cold water for a few minutes) which made it a brighter green color and gave it a better taste and consistency. It does get a little watery after awhile but it doesn't affect the taste. I recommend letting the flavors sit together for awhile for the best results.",
