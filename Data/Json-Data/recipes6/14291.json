I made exactly to the instructions and it just tastes like nothing to me. It was a little dry but that could have been execution on my part. However there's no reason the bread should have been so bland when I followed the directions exactly. They don't taste like beans but thwey don't really taste like cinnamon or anything either. I ended up throwing the loaf out. I think you'd be better off pureeing the beans and putting them in another type of bread. It is a good idea for a hidden source of fiber etc but not flavor!",
