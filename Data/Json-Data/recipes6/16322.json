I used self-rising flour instead of all-purpose and I added 3/4 c. choc. chips to the mix. I made sure the sugars and butter were creamed to a fluffy light color. The final outcome was terrific. I can visually see the inside is soft and the outside is chewy. I cooked for 40 min. in a 350 oven.  I had some pecans I wanted to use up and I am glad I found this recipe. Thanks!",

The bars were way too thick and never got completely done, even after cooking them 10+ extra minutes.  The recipe sounded great and I really wanted the bars to work out, so I made a second batch and they turned out the same as the first batch.  They definitely need to be in a bigger pan than 8x8.  I was preparing the bars to take to a party.  Even though I wasn't happy with the results, I took them anyway.  They didn't turn out pretty, so it was hard to get people to try them.  Those that did try them, said they liked them, but there were a lot left over.",
