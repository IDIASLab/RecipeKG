I don't even have a quality cookie sheet and the bottoms were perfect.  I used strawberry preserves for half and orange marmalade for the other half.  I did not garnish with powdered sugar.  The jewel tones of the filling were pretty enough.  \r\nProbably the best cookies I have ever made.  This recipe definitely made me look like a good baker.  Thanks.",

The flavors aren't bold, but I think that is a wonderful thing.  If you are making a cookie platter, the last thing you want are all the cookies to be screaming with over-sweetness & repeating flavors.  This is so nice because the cream chees & butter give a really rich dough & the apricot just gives a faint sweetness.  I rolled the dough out, & spread the jam on the top & rolled like a jelly roll & then cut the cookies to make pinwheels which is a nice variation.  I had another butter cookie recipe with the raspberry imprints, & so this was more of a variation then just the traditional print cookies.  Another nice thing is that it makes a LOT of cookies, it strained my Kitchen-Aid a little on the lower speeds but I only because I dumped in all the flour at once.  Add the flour slowly & you will avoid this!  Overall, very, very, yummy!!!",

                "reviewBody": "What a great cookie!!  This is the type of taste that my family loves - not bland but not over sweet.  Since this made so many, I was able to experiment with each tray that went into the oven.  I put different flavored jams on several dozen - including Hot Pepper Jelly (it was a hit).  One batch, I rolled the cookie first into ground walnuts. I did end up sprinkling each batch with powdered sugar except those rolled in nuts.  Next time, I'm going to try rolling in colored granulated sugar.  Here's 3 BIG tips: 1. I prefer to bake on parchment paper.  2. With this cookie, I used the smaller end of my Melon Baller to make the indent instead of using my finger (I have nails).  I held my fingers around the ball shape and then pressed gently with the rounded side of the Melon Baller - almost to the bottom of the cookie. This gave the cookies uniform indents and reasonable size to fill with the jam.  Dip the Melon Baller in powdered sugar first to prevent sticking.  3. Put the lemon in the microwave for 15 seconds before zesting and juicing.  I was able to get 2 Tbls. juice out of one half of the lemon.  I refrigerated the dough before rolling into balls and had no problems.  This recipe would be great for a Cookie Exchange.  Definetly was a hit with everyone and was told to make them again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.",

That didn't happen exactly.. after about 5 minutes in the fridge I took out the dough and made a quick batch to try out. The dough worked well even not chilled very long. I used 3 jellies - Apricot Raspberry(as others suggested) and Apple (b/c I had it in the house). The Winner - Apple! It is hard to beat the other flavors but apple was just different enough to win. Also I made the original recipe size and used 2 sticks regular butter 1 stick unsalted butter. When cooling - I did 2 minutes on the pan 2 minutes on the wire rack then put the cookies and rack in to the freezer for 2 minutes then let them continue cooling on rack on the counter. I am not sure why but cooling them slightly in the freezer always helps them stay moist longer. Excellent reviews! Even from long-time picky cookie makers!",
