I made the whole thing so I could have enough pancakes for a couple days. I had to play with the recipe a bit because it dosen't really come out right. The whole dry mix makes three cups of mix but the measurement of adding wet to dry asks for 1 1/3 cups of the dry which comes out to more than the recipe makes. I make pancakes a lot so I kind of knew what to use for the whole dry mix ingredients (two eggs two cups buttermilk 1/4 cup melted butter/vegetable oil two teaspoons vanilla). I used a mixture of whole wheat flour and AP flour buttermilk instead of regular milk and melted butter instead of vegetable oil. I served these pancakes with homemade maple-vanilla syrup. We LOVED them. There's just enough leftover for a small two-boy breakfast tomorrow (or a midnight snack for the husband if he so chooses) which is good enough for me. I'll make this pancake recipe again using my changes. NOTE: Remember that this pancake batter will be thick--so don't panic and think you've messed up your pancakes. It's supposed to look like that.",

I did however try making a pancake before altering the original recipe to give the recipe the beneift of the doubt. It wasn't to my liking so I added approximately 1/4 cup of additional milk to the remaining batter. I made another pancake and decided to add a little vanilla approximately 1/2 teaspoon. As others have mentioned limiting the dry ingredients to 1 /4 cup to 1 cup milk would probably be the appropriate ratios for pancake batter. This would have been a 5 recipe if the dry/wet ratios were accurate. Otherwise great tasting pancake with maple syrup. My 4 year old came into the kitchen and asked if we were having cinnamon rolls. They smelled delicious while cooking. One more note: Why would you layer everything if you only use part of the mix to make batter? You force your gift recipient to use it all or mix it up themselves and put the remaining back in the jar. I am not layering this recipe and mixing it up before packaging it. Sure it is probably prettier by layering but just not practical with this recipe unless you plan to use the whole jar at once.",

The first reviewer was correct this recipe doesn't measure out correctly. I added 1/2 c wheat flour the first time and that made it 3 equal batches. The second time however I added 1/2 cup dried apples instead. When I measured it out I got 3 batches using 1 1/4 cup mix. You don't need a full cup of milk doing it that way.
