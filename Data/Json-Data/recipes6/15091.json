Seems my Great Great Aunt made the same pie back when my Mom was growing up. I'd say the Sour Cream Custard Pie is very similar to Mincemeat in taste. Nice thing you don't have to pick around those mysterious hunks and chunks of \"scary things\" that lurk under the top crust of a Mince Pie... This is a very easy quick and EXTREMELY TASTY pie. Thank You Suzanne for submitting this recipe and for bringing back some happy momories of her youth to my Mom.",
