The O-Brien mix I USED to use had much more veggies in it. I was disappointed in the shortage of veggies. This was Ok for a quick mix but definitely needs more veggies or expect the dish to need same thing you would add to a potato... This is literally more of a potato pie - versus an egg dish. Next time I would add some herbs probably still follow the egg cream milk mixture - and add maybe 1 cup of potato mix and max of 2 to 4 oz the cheese. Any mix left over scramble it up in a pan - or put into muffin tins for single servings. It was a crowd pleaser for a couple of potato fans - but maybe consider it more for a lunch or dinner side dish instead of brunch unless revised to be more egg/veggie like.",
