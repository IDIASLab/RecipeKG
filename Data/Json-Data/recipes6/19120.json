It is too loose (watery) for crepe batter and just ran into an extremely thin layer that could not be flipped. Despite very heavy butter in the pan, it still stuck to the pan. So I had scraped up cooked dough. There isn\u2019t a lot of flavor to the crepes.  I\u2019ve always used Julia Child\u2019s crepe recipe successfully. It calls for 3 egg yolks and 1-\u00bd cups flour for 1 cup milk plus 5 Tbsp melted butter in the crepe mix plus lightly brushing the pan with butter. Big differences! I pin the future, I will just add some anise extract and Cointreau to Julia\u2019s recipe. No, I do NOT recommend this recipe.",
