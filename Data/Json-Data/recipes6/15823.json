Instead of using all ground beef, I opted to use a combination of ground pork and ground beef (12 oz ground beef, 4 oz ground pork) -instead of plain bread crumbs, I used pre-seasoned breadcrumbs, I increased the parmesan cheese to 4 oz. \n\nWith the sauce, instead of using 2 (28 oz) cans of whole tomatoes, I used 1 (28 oz can) of whole tomatoes, and then two smaller cans (14 oz) of crushed tomatoes.  After simmering the sauce, I ran half of it through the blender to make it smoother.  I also added a small can of tomato sauce in addition to the tomato paste, plus for added flavour I added 1 tsp italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp basil, and 1 tsp garlic powder.\n\nYUMMY!!!!!!!!!!",

I work long hours and don't have time at night to make a 2 hour meal, so what I did was use my slow cooker. In the morning i sauteed my onion and garlic, combined it with all the ingredience including half a can of tomato sauce for extra liquid since it tends to lose some in a slow cooker. Had my husband turn the cooker on low at his lunch, so the sauce cooked about 6 1/2 hours. one hour before the sauce was done, he put the meat balls in. We did end up adding the extra half a can of sauce just for liquid, but the flavor was amazing. By using the slow cooker for us working cooks, it was nice to come home to a ready made meal and good as this.",

The eggs will bind them, but not make them moister - adding liquid makes them exquisitely tender and juicy.  Also, if you want a lighter meatball, substitute oatmeal for the breadcrumbs - measure it first, then run it briefly in the blender so you won't have any big bits in the meatballs.  I added 1.5 tsp oregano and 3 tsp basil; added 1 tsp seasoned salt, 1 medium green pepper.  I was very, very happy with the sauce.  Put it into a 250 degree oven while I cooked other stuff, for about 2 hours,it was wonderful.  :D",

Also, I used crackers (pounded or processed to crumbs) in place of bread crumbs, and used a little less than called for.  This made a very solid and yummy meatball - for those who have \"spongey\" meatballs.  For those who used store-bought sauce with the meatballs - nothing compares with this sauce!",

In the meatballs, I used only 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground sausage; 1/2 cup crushed buttery crackers i.e. Ritz; 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese, garlic powder toi taste, 2 Tbsp chopped onion, 1 Tbsp Bell pepper, 1 Tbsp chopped celery and 1/2 pkg hamburger or meatloaf seasoning mix.  I prepared my meatballs and cooked them in the oven on a sheet pan for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  Then added them to my sauce.  My Sauce included 1/2 stalk chopped celery, 1/4 chopped bell pepper 1 Tbsp sugar and rather than 2 28 ounce cans whole tomatoes, I used 1 ea. 28 oz can Crushed Tomatoes and 1 ea. 28 ounce can Tomato Puree.  This eliminated the lumpy tomato chunks.  I eliminated the tomato paste altogether.  I reduced my cooking time to 30 minutes and then 30 minutes after adding the meatballs.",
