I also treated them as a \"drop\" cookie since my dough was a little moist. I use this recipe as a base for peanut butter cookies (add 1/2 cup peanut butter & leave out nuts & raisins and grind all the oatmeal) and chocolate chip cookies because they are the perfect combination of crispy outside & chewy inside.",

I lost control of the vanilla bottle when measuring and put probably twice as much in as I was supposed to, no problem.  Didn't have quite enough white sugar so I topped it off with brown sugar, no problem.  And best of all, I always forget the last batch that I put in the oven and end up ruining them, but these, even though they were pretty brown, they were still great!  Unbelievable!  I put chocolate chips in them, yummy.  I can't wait to try some of the other suggested variations.  You won't be disappointed with this recipe.",

The second time I made them I increased the oatmeal to a full cup. To avoid saturated fat and trans fat I substituted Canola Harvest 0 Trans Fat margarine for shortening [Crisco 0 Tans Fat PER SERVING Shortening actually has a lot of trans fats...they get around it by increasing the claimed serving size, sqeaking by the FDA rule], and for an increased burst of flavor when the cookie first touches your tongue, I greased the cookie sheet with butter. This adds just a minimal amount of saturated fat/cholesterol, but a lot of flavor.\r\nI have also made this recipe adding walnuts and cranberries...delicious, but still full of healthful stuff to \"offset\" the cookie's decadence.",

By complete accident I once forgot to add the 1/2c of white sugar. This actually turned out almost as good as the crisp cookies in a completely different way! There were nice and chewy.

I thought they could use a few more oats (they weren't distinctly \"oatmeal\" if I didn't know I may not even have noticed the oats!).
