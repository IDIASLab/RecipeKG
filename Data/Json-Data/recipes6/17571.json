My whole family loves this.  It is my husbands favorite dish and my youngest son which is 9 says that this corn \"rocks\".  I do suggest using 1 and 1/2 (16 oz.) pkgs. of corn, 1/4 tsp. of pepper, and 1 tsp. of salt.  I also think that it is best to heat all the ingredients except for the corn on the stovetop before placing in the crockpot.  Start on high in the crockpot and cook for one hour.  Turn to low and cook for around 3-4 hours.  This one is realy good.",

It is the texture of the corn.  My advice (I wish I would have done this) use 2 bags frozen white corn (of course fresh is better but if you don't have fresh corn).  Put one bag in the blender or food processer with the 1/2 cup milk.  Combine bag of whole corn and blender corn in crock pot.  I think the cream cheese and butter could be reduced also.  Just ok, the recipe, I am sticking to my mom's tried and true, melt a stick of butter in pan add flour, add 2 bags white corn 1 blended in blender one whole, add milk and cook on stove top, she added pepper too, (mom :) rip).",

Certainly a once in awhile thing with all the butter and cream cheese but I might try it out next time with a butter substitute and lower calorie cream cheese and see how that works out.

As others said it seemed to need more corn for the amount of cream sauce that it makes. Do stir after your chunks of cream cheese and butter are at the melting point in your crock pot. They do not disperse evenly on their own. Flavor was more savory and corny than sweet if you do not add more sugar than the recipe calls for, but I really liked that. The cream cheese did not give it a big cheesey taste either. I love cheese but I wasn\u2019t trying to make cheese corn. Much different and more gourmet tasting than the stuff in the can. I will make this again.",

The recipe was extremely easy to make. I followed some previous reviews and melted the cream cheese/butter before added to the crock-pot with the rest of the ingredients. I did measure out 1 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper. I increased the corn to 1 1/2 16-oz. bags of frozen corn kernels. I cooked it on high for about 2 hours or so, and it turned out perfectly. I used reduced fat Philadelphia cream cheese, light butter, and a sugar/Splenda blend; no one could tell a difference! I will definitely be adding this recipe to my list of favorites.",
