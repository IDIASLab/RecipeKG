This may not look like your classic apple crisp but it tastes every bit as good and is so much simpler to make. This would be a particularly nice dessert if you have unexpected guests drop in. It just may be that my apple was a little small but I would check the apple halves for doneness at 25 minutes (before adding granola) as mine did turn a bit mushy with a full 45 minutes of baking. Caraloopy for your first recipe you ve given us a winner!",
