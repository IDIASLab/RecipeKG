This was my first time trying these and I prepped them as described on Health Canada's website (Trim remove papery husk if any and rinse through several changes of water then boil for roughly 8 mins strain and then proceed with recipe.) These cannot be be eaten undercooked or raw otherwise you're putting yourself at risk for food-borne illness. I added some diced onion to this and think that balsamic vinegar would be a delicious substitute for the lemon juice.",
