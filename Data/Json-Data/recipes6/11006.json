This pineapple cake has a lighter flavor and is slightly less filing as well. The only part of the recipe I did not understand was the warning not to double the recipe. If done correctly the cake does fine doubled trippled or even quadrupled!:) If you plan on baking for a crowd don't turn down this recipe because of the false information. This cake tastes great no matter what!",

Followed recipe except used 2.5C golden raisins 1C dried cherries 1C homemade candied lemon peel grated orange rind of 3 oranges and did not brush with butter on top after baking. Flavours and results were worth all the fruit used.
