Since they have less bread, you can taste the other flavors better, and they are healthier since they are broiled rather than grilled with lots of butter. You can serve them anywhere from a Super Bowl party to a shower (although I would recommend eating with utensils at the latter since the sandwiches can get messy).",

Also, I think using thinly shaved corned beef makes them easier to assemble. If the meat is too think it doesn't want to stay folded. (I guess you could just cut it into little pieces and stack them up but then that adds another prep step.) The biggest problem with them is if you make a ton of them you need a really LARGE tray for transporting them. They don't do well stacked on top of each other.",
