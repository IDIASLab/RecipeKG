A few tips: To prevent the cake from breaking/cracking you need to roll it up in the cloth IMMEDIATELY after taking it out of the oven! Also the more you whip your eggs (I used a stand mixer on high for 5 minutes) the lighter and fluffier your cake will be. I used a recipe for chocolate silk frosting instead (from good housekeeping) so it wasn't as sweet as the cream cheese would have been... which I think was the right choice! It actually got better the next day--the frosting kept the cake nice and moist and after a night in the fridge the flavors were really well blended.",

It fixed all of the cracks and the cake looked and tasted great. Also use a fork to make the log marks on the cake. With these changes it is just like the French restaurant's yule log where I used to work. You don't need to use the liqueur; it's fine without it. Nobody knew the difference at the restaurant.",
