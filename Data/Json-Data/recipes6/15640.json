Kept just about everything the same but made a few good changes based on all the reviews posted about it being too sweet. These are the changes I made: TOTALLY omitted the sugar water syrup...definitely not needed. Used a 2 liter bottle of Raspberry Ginger Ale instead of the regular ginger ale and carbonated water. The ginger ale taste not Sprite is the key. Used 1 can of frozen fruit punch instead of the orange juice used pink lemonade instead of regular lemonade used raspberry sherbet instead of orange. To mix - Add the cans of frozen concentrate to your punch bowl pour in the raspberry ginger ale stir until dissolved pour in the cherry juice and cherries making sure to leave out enough cherries to place on top of each orange slice. Add the ice stir add the raspberry sherbet in scoops. Stir. Place the oranges on top and put a cherry in the middle of each orange slice. Delicious! Still somewhat of a sweet punch but the taste was fabulous. Got many many compliments and people were asking how I made it. This recipe is definitely a keeper that I will use over and over again!",

I also floated some of those Wilton candy decs (usually for cupcakes?) in the shape of Elmo on top and everyone thought that was sooooo cute/cool. Also I kept waiting for the syrup to get \"thick\" until my science teacher husband said that the properties of the two ingredients wouldn't allow that to happen...the syrup was pretty thin and thickened a little as it cooled.",
