Also subbed green onion for regular (had 'em) and chopped uo a dill pickle instead of sweet relish. I'm a goof about altering recipies (not always with good results) but this one surely doesn't need goofing with. Thank you sooooooo much for sharing this!! My new favorite salad!",

I gave it five stars because it's similar, a great start, and a good change of pace. Kidney beans, onion, celery, and mayonaise are the basics. My grandmother always added to the basics and made it differently depending on what was on hand. I make my dressing more like potato or macaroni salad dressing. I mash 2 hard boiled eggs, add my mayo, a squirt of prepared mustard, and a splash of pickle juice. I also spice it up a bit with little garlic powder, a touch of salt and pepper, and maybe a pinch of cayenne or paprika. My grandmother always used either chopped pickles (dill and/or sweet) or chopped cucumber. Optional items would include cheese (Velveeta, Colby, or mild or sharp cheddar, try your favorite cheese), peppers (green, yellow, or red), and even a chopped apple. The trick to this salad is to make it before the rest of your meal so that it has time for the flavors to meld a bit.",
