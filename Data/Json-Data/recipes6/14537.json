I also lined the cookie sheets with foil rather than greasing them (I felt the cookies had enough butter in them to prevent sticking) which worked like a charm. This recipe made about 40 cookies for me but I used a heaping teaspoon of dough for each cookie. The dough was not the least bit dry perhaps because I used an extra large egg with just the smallest bit of extra vanilla. A good cookie.",
