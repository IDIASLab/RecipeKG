I LOVE hot sauce!) you are going to need to add some spice to it. As for the meat balls, it is a simple enough recipe to follow (took me 3 minutes to measure, mix and roll) but they do lack their own flavor identity. I would suggest choosing your own meat seasoning and adding it to the meat mixture before rolling into balls. This recipe is a good one and will be used again! Next time, I will add seasoning and vegetables to the meat mixture and add more SPICE to the sauce! ENJOY!!! :)",

Unfortunately I can't find that cook book at the moment. :(  The only difference between that recipe and this one, is that instead of using 1/3 cup water (which is about 6 TBS), it calls for 3T water and 3T white vinegar.  The vinegar definitely balances out the super sweet flavor of the sugar, and in my opinion tastes better; more tangy.  Therefore I can only give this recipe 4 stars.  Still good tho.  :)",

As it turns out I found my variation to be ridiculously good. I substituted Italian seasoned bread crumbs for the crackers nixed the onions altogether since I am not an enthusiast and added 1/2 cup of grated parmesan-romano cheese to the mixture. After rolling the meatballs and arranging them on the baking sheet I very lightly dusted the tops with just a skosh more cheese. I also felt that while the sauce was good I wanted something extra to spice it up. To achieve that I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon red cayenne pepper. For appetizer-sized portions the amount of sauce this recipe makes is perfect. However if you are looking for a slightly saucier dish I would recommend upping the sauce ingredients by at least 50% as covering 20 meatballs made from 1 lb. of ground meat won't leave much extra.",
