It produced not a batter but a dough so I second the comment that \"pouring the batter is impossible\"-- it made not so much a cake as a mildly sweet bread. I suspect that the recipe has an error in it and that it calls for too much flour for the butter and sugar. Of course very old recipes for Seed Cake sometimes made more of a bread than a cake and perhaps I was expecting a more Victorian product. I was tempted to add some mace or even vanilla (both of which are ingredients in other recipes for Seed Cake); I also used some ground caraway along with the whole seed. On the whole this recipe as stated makes a pleasant somewhat sweet dense bread which is nice with tea or coffee.",

Yes the dough is quite stiff so you need to use a spatula to scoop it out and spread it into your pan - but that's what's supposed to happen. It's best eaten in the first day or two or it gets stale - but if that happens use it to make a trifle with!:-) One hint is not to go overboard with the caraway seeds. I also grind them in a coffee grinder before adding them - it makes them not quite such a surprise to bite into when you're eating your seed cake and makes the flavor all throughout the cake. I very often have people try to guess what flavors the cake and NO ONE ever can - they're always shocked to hear that it's caraway! And then they always ask for the recipe!:-) This one is absolutely one of my GO TO favorites!!!",
