Also used corn tortillas instead of flour. Thus making this both vegan and gluten free. Left out the corn because my wife doesn't like it. Also used some roasted hatch green chile's I had in the freezer rather than canned green chiles.\n\nThe enchiladas were great, but don't hold up very well. I think it might hold up better with flour tortillas. I'll continue to use corn though to keep it gluten free. Maybe next time I'll skip putting the enchilada sauce beneath the enchiladas.",

I didn't want to overpower the dish and the flavors were perfect. I doubled the recipe and instead of using  all refried beans; I used 1 can of refried beans and one can of organic black beans. It really was perfect...I am going to use these for my catering business...Yes; they have some prep work involved but I bet you could freeze these and make many meals out of them!",

I will try again but I will add diced jalapeno peppers and chili powder to the mix and probably cut the cream cheese since I don't feel a need to have such creamy enchiladas and it will make it healthier too. I think I'll go with whole black beans instead as well.Fortunately I ran low on Cilantro and only put in half and it still came through strong so I'd suggest halving it unless you really like a lot of cilantro.",
