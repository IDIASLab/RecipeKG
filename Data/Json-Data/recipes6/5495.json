Also, for more of a Maryland flavor, I added a lot of Old Bay, instead of the listed herbs.  Also, don't cook the shrimp with the onion... it makes them very tough.  Put the shrimp in at the very end... they only need to cook until they turn pink.  Otherwise, very easy recipe.",

I only had a half pound shrimp, so I chopped up some cooked chicken breast and through that in as a substitute.  I used butter instead of margarine.  I used fresh corn (cut it off the cob) and low sodium chicken broth.  I also tossed in 2 russet potatoes (peeled, and cut into small bites) to make it more like a chowder, adding a little extra milk to thin it out. For spices I used my own combination of Tony Sachers Cajun spice, Emeril's essence, Cayenne, and pleny of fresh ground pepper!  I thought I would prefer these spices to the more mellow rosemary and thyme and it turned out fabulous!",

During the cooking of the onion in butter, 2 Tablespoons of flour could be worked into a roux to make the soup a bit thicker. I used the lo-fat celery soup and crm of shrimp soup in place of the chicken.  Shrimp soup should be shrimp!!  I did feel it needed extra seasonings which I added.  All in all I will probably make it again with some slight changes.  I had to omit the corn for my husband's diet, but he  ate 2 bowls.",

I used shrimp stock instead of chicken broth - I also added green and red bell peppers in with the onions and it gave the soup a pretty presentation with all of the colors - you can also add celery if you like - if you aren't interested in saving calories you can substitute butter for the margarine and heavy cream for the skim milk - they make a terrific creamy soup - all in all a good recipe to start off with:)",

I also threw in a small can of chopped clams used 1/2 clam juice 1/2 chicken broth and some Old Bay to get more seafood taste. I used cream of broccoli instead of celerey because I'm not a celery fan. Used fat free heavy cream instead of milk and highly reccommend some cayenne pepper if you like a little kick.
