I used 1 medium onion (diced) and 2 stalks of celery (about 1 cup) and 1 leek. This was more than enough to generously cover my bread (I used homemade artisan bread that I had on hand).  Other than these adjustments, I followed the recipe. This was one of the juiciest chickens that I've ever made. Cooking time for me was 1-1/4 hour. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this, and agreed that it was a \"do again\" dinner.",

There was a little heat but not much. When I made the recipe, I cut all of the ingredients in half, using half of a chicken. I think next time I would halve everything but the saut\u00e9ed vegetable/spice mixture. We raised chickens for meat during this quarantine and had them butchered last week! Perfect way to enjoy our chicken. I\u2019ll be making this again, but with crusty sourdough bread, to see how this dish works with that change!",

The vegetables were very tasty, but the bread was a gooey mess with all that chicken juice and my chicken was very rubbery.  I fault Wal-Mart for that.
