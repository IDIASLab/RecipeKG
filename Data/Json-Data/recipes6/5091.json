Making it in a pressure cooker just scared me. After seeing this in the Jan 2018 magazine I decided to give it a try. It really works. I added a half cup more broth than written and it was a bit watery but I cooked it down a bit (about 45 seconds) before adding the cheese. The consistency was perfect. The rice was not mushy. This is a recipe to trust. I will use it again definitely. Grazie Miche!",
