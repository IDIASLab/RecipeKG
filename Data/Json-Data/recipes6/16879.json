I did not use all the dressing about half. It looked beautiful and tasted wonderful! I did add some crumbled goat cheese and was very pleased with the addition. If this salad sounds good to you try it and don't worry about the runny dressing because the orange flavor it adds to the salad is well worth it.",

I stuck it in the freezer to cool because I was a little pressed for time. It worked out just fine. The dressing is very tasty. I might add a bit more sugar next time but tastes fine as is. I added crumbled feta on top of my finished product. Thanks for a new twist on salad J. Craig.",

                "reviewBody": "I started out with doubling the dressing. I thought the salad would be small but it serves at least 10. Anyway I cooked orange juice down to half thinking maybe that was why some reviews said it wouldn't thicken. I had no better luck doing it this way. Was still very watery. I added less olive oil and it was still overpowering flavor. Didn't like it. I kept trying to \"fix\" it but ended up throwing it out. I ended up using the dressing from Betsy's mandarin orange salad(this web site). I thought I would have to get more than 2 pears. I was serving 8 and had to do 2 servings without nuts and wanted everyone to have a good taste of the pears. So I got 6 asian pears and it cost me 9.oo! It wasn't necessary to get all those pears 3 would have been enough. They held up good during cooking time I think another type of pear may get mushy. I never had asian pears before they are shaped like an apple slice like an apple I was worried they weren't ripe because they are firm but they were. This part of the salad was good. Wait to add pears and dressing to lettuce until just before serving. I added pears to salad ahead of time and it got very wilted even without the dressing. I really didn't need to double anything afterall. My husband loved it and so did my other guests but I thought it was too sweet My fault for trying to double pear mix.I won't use that many pears next time. It did have a complex of flavors and that I liked. Thanks J. Craig!",

I tried that but didn't like the flavor of the dressing when I blended in the onion it over powered the flavors. So I used the recipe from Orange Vinaigrette Brown Rice Salad (also on this site) I also used Red Wine vinegar instead of balsamic vinegar as someone said it turns the dressing a brownish color. I waited until time to serve to add the dressing and topped it with crumbled goat cheese (a first for me but very mild flavor and good) Its a very elegant salad and I got many complements.",
