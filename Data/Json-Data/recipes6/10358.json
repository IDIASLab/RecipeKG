Very lemony flavour and a very dense, moist  bread, I did have to bake mine longer though. I skipped the glaze too. One small detail that is missing in the directions...it does not say WHEN to add the lemon juice, I added it after I creamed the shortening/sugar and eggs and BEFORE the adding the milk, otherwise that much lemon juice would have curdled the milk instantly. Good recipe and thanks for providing it!",

I add a little to the batter, and a little to the glaze and it's really delicious.  I've found that the bread takes less time in my oven, about 45 minutes, but everyone's oven is different.  When you think its ready then it probably is, (if you know what your doing :-) otherwise it won't be as moist as it should be.",
