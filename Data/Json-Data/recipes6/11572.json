I did add more cayenne than it said though and more curry than it said and crushed red pepper as we both like spicy food. I recommend it highly!!!!",

I followed others advice by only putting in 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and using chicken stock rather than water I also blended the onions into a paste rather than frying them chopped. I added cornflour to thicken and organic half fat yoghurt to mellow the spices. There's lots of disgreement about spicyness - I like mild curries so I thought this was quite spicy it your pallet is more suited to super hot then you probably need to add hotter/more curry powder and cayenne pepper. Fantastic I will definitely use again and would use to entertain.",

I made the following changes according to Curry Chicken II - 4.5T of curry powder and 1 can each of chicken broth and cream of chicken soup(instead of water to cover) I also added a dash of accent and a lot more than a dash of Goya's Adobe and a creole seasoning instead of salt. (I did not use any cayenne pepper because my curry powder was HOT). I omitted the ginger(didnt have any) and I omitted the lemon and tomato paste(just over looked them while toggling between recipes. However mine was so good I doubt I add them in the future) I cooked in a crock pot for about 6 hours on low. I added in potatoes half way through. At the end I thickened my sauce with corn starch. Served over rice. This was to die for!!!!! I have definitely found my curry recipe!",
