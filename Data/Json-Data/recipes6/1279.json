I had researched and read that you should not stir your sugar when you make brittle but that IS NOT the case with this recipe. Because this recipe has butter but no water you can stir the sugar. In fact if you don't stir the sugar it might burn. I know this because I burnt my first batch - trying to be all fancy (actually it was still pretty good). However my second batch was fantastic. This would make a great gift. P.S. I used Wheylow Gold (a brown sugar substitute) so it was much lower in carbs.",
