I used a toothpick to swirl the white chocolate after it had melted a bit and because of the short cooking time found that I had to completly finish each cookie sheet before I put the next in to bake. Be sure and add the half cherry on top it adds lots of flavor to the cookie. Thanks for the recipe. It will be on my Christmas bake list every year from now on.",
