It was too hard to cut into slices, so I added a little dried ginger powder instead. I should have grated the frozen ginger into the tea, but hindsight is 2020. I like my chai sweet, so I added a splash of honey with the sugar. I also added 1 or 2 more cardamom pods because that's usually my favorite part of the traditional chai spices. I also added a small piece of star anise -- it wasn't even a whole piece, more like a segment --  other recipes have star anise listed and I had it in my spice cupboard. I used twinings english breakfast tea bags, which are pretty robust. \n\nI made it the night before, strained it in a heat-proof glass dish to chill overnight, and then the next day I reheated in a  big glass measuring cup before pouring into a thermos. I used 1 1/2 cups of the concentrate and about a 1/2 cup of Silk almondmilk.\n\nFlavorwise, I was really pleased with the outcome. It definitely isn't weak, especially with the 10  strong teabags. I was very afraid it was going to be too clove-y or peppery, but I was pleasantly surprised at how it was just enough to clear the nose in a good way.  I wouldn't mind a little more cinnamon, so perhaps I'll add an extra stick next time. I wish I knew the caffeine content because I am definitely feeling a jolt. 10 tea bags, remember? \n\nThank you for the recipe.  It was so convenient",
