Also used silicone pans. No problems there. Made a filling with whipping cream pudding and nuts for the cake and used a chocolate frosting from another recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and made a Swiss Merengue Buttercream Chocolate Frosting and covered the lot with rolled out Marzipan (I made it for my son's first birthday). Yummy. I pulsed the Sauerkraut in my food processor to make sure it's finely chopped as I had read the reviews about it being a little stringy for some. I then squeezed out any excess brine. Next time i might use a touch more Sauerkraut. And there will definitely be a next time. It is not THE BEST chocolate cake recipe I have ever had but it is very good and I just love the gimmick of having Sauerkraut in a cake.",
