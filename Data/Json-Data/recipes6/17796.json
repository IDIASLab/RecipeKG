I also found that it was easier to divide the dough into eighths before making a \"rope\" -- it was just much easier to handle. Also when I cut the rope into 2 inch pieces I gently rolled the piece again (before dipping in milk) to get it into a shape and size that worked and looked inviting. To those who are considering making this recipe the prep time is a little misleading --- it takes much longer than 10 minutes to get all the ingredients together and the dough mixed to the right consistency but it wa well worth the effort!",
