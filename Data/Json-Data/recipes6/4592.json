I found that I needed more broth to thin it up a bit - ended up adding two more cups.  I also felt it needed lots more cumin, salt, and pepper.  We served with whole wheat naan bread and everyone cleaned their bowls!  Very healthy dish - good for your heart!!!",

And I cut down on the garlic by 1/2.  I love garlic, but I think you would have only tasted garlic had I put in the full amount called for.  I also lightened it up a bit by adding a little chicken stock, as indeed, it is very thick.  And I used sour cream instead of yogurt.  But dang!  This was pretty good!!  Served it with warm crusty sour dough rolls, and it was a very full meal.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing.",
