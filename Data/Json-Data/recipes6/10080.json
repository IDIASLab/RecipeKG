I shredded my chicken breast and mixed it in with the rice. Hubby preferred his chicken breast whole. We're going through a stay-at-home order due to the Coronavirus pandemic and this was a great meal to make with items that I already had.",

The family loved it- even my very picky son went back for seconds. The cream added a nice richness to the dish, but I was hoping the sauce might thicken after a while, which it didn't. Next time I may try sour cream instead. And I will definitely use more chilis as I prefer more heat. A good, hearty dish, perfect when there's a chill in the air.",

I did not use the hatch peppers because to ship a pound to my area from New Mexico was $27 plus shipping. There is an approved substitution  for the hatch pepper found in most markets across the USA that is the cubanelle or frying pepper. Besides the pepper substitution, I did add about a tablespoon of corn starch dissolved in about 2 tablespoon of water added to last 30 minute of cooking. This definitely thickened the sauce which was fabulous on chicken bouillon rice.  I love mushrooms so I\u2019ll add or double the stated quantity next time.",
