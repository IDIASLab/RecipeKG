I make it as part of a weekly meal plan so I use chicken from another recipe (Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style, definitely check it out). When I make the chickens I save all of the juices and use them in place of the commercial chicken broth in the this recipe. The chicken broth instead of milk is really what gives this recipe it's amazing flavor. Other than the chicken substitution I follow the rest of the recipe as listed. I really like the cavatappi noodles which are a hit with my picky eaters.",
