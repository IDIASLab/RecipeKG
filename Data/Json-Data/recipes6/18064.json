I omit the cumin (which I am not fond of) and the oregano and substite garlic powder for those seasonings. I sprinkle the steaks liberally with lemon and garlic powder before cooking for best taste. This is the way my grandpa used to make them and it is the recipe I still swear by with white rice black beans fried plantains and yuca con mojo (cassava root salted and boiled and served with a warm dressing of olive oil lemon garlic and onion).",

The spices in the breading mixture added a nice background taste but they were not over powering. The thing I really loved is the slight lemon flavor the garnish gave. We ended up topping ours with fresh squeezed lemon we liked it so much. The only thing I would change is the recipe made way too much breading mixture. I would cut that in half.",

A little bland by itself however but to liven it up I added a topping of...can of diced tomatoes with (mild or reg) green chilies packet of Sazon seasoning some chopped onion minced garlic oregano and some corn starch to thicken. Makes a wonderful topping for the steak. Also served with yellow rice black beans and corn. Delicious meal! A hit everytime! Roxie Thanks so much for submitting this recipe!",
