My lemons were large and I ended up with a total of 1 cup of lemon juice. Because of that it did not thicken up like I thought it should. I wanted it thick so I could spread it on a cake so I added about a 1Tb of cornstarch stirred in with a little hot water to thicken it up. Still it wasn't quite as thick as I thought it should be. However it tasted great just what I was looking for. This is how I used it. I made a \"poke\" cake where you pour lemon jello mix over the cake which has had holes poked in it. I then spread this lemon filling over the top of the cake. Then I topped it with Cool Whip. It tasted great very lemony and tart like we wanted. It would be nice to know how much lemon juice is needed since all lemons are not created equal in size! Once I know what the optimum amount of juice is the recipe will be perfect. 5 star rating for taste.",
