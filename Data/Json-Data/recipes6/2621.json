The texture was just about perfect, firm but not dry, and the oatmeal itself is the star in this recipe.  The sweet potato not only enhances the texture, but it lends itself to a sweetness balance that is spot on.  Was good with a drizzle of maple syrup.",

I baked it in an 11 x 8 inch rimmed cookie sheet sprayed with cooking spray for the full 30 minutes. It made 8 good sized portions. The texture was soft and firm. It's not overly sweet which was fine for me.  For those who like sweeter oatmeal, add additional sugar or drizzle maple syrup on top of individual portions. I think a splash of vanilla would enhance the flavor. The sweet potato flavor is subtle and a perfect compliment to the oatmeal. I plan to freeze individual potions and pop in the microwave for a quick breakfast. Next time I will substitute my \"salted caramel\" coffee creamer for part of the milk and chopped nuts for additional crunch.  Raisins or dried cranberries would also add a little more sweetness.",
