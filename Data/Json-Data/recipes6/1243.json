I add chocolate chips and sometimes nuts (but don't reduce the toffee). Also I use the Heath 'Bits o Brickle' rather than the chopped candy bars. I've modified this recipe a hundred different ways but other than the bit o' brickle chocolate chips and nuts don't change a thing. I usually make 2 - 4 batches at a time then freeze what I don't bake in ziplock bags (flattened at about 1/4\" thick). When I want to make a batch I get one out rip the bag off and cut the frozen dough into little squares. Don't forget to use parchment paper a silicone mat or silpat on your cookie sheet.",

Two things I would like to point out though: First of all I baked mine for 12 minutes and I think I should have taken them out a minute or two before that. Secondly I think you should use softened butter in this recipe as with most cookie recipes. The recipe didn't say. Anyways thanks...I love Heath bars!",

So good - chewy and delicious and super fast and easy to make!",
