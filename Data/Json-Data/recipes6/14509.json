When filling the pie plate,  I was afraid the pie would overflow because I didn't know how much it would actually puff.  I made the whole pie and 4 small tarts. I could have added a little more filling in the large pie.  This is a super easy recipe.  Thank you Debbie for sharing!  We are enjoying it!",
