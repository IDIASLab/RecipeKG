Instead I placed all ingredients in a pot of water covering the pork tenderloin. I also used fresh thyme instead of dry. I brined it for 24 hours. After I discarded the brine water I placed the pork tenderloin in a roasting pan. I then rubbed sage pepper and rosemary on it then followed the rest of the directions to cook the tenderloin. The results were great. The tenderloin was flavorful the stuffing mixture complimented the flavors of the meat well and it was an easy recipe to make. I highly recommend this recipe to everyone.",

My time got away from me, and the roast should have come out of the oven just a little sooner (typically, I take it out at 145, but it was 154 this time), but it still was fabulous.    Never thought about this until well into cooking, but in the future, I'll add a little water or white wine to the pan, so I'll be able to make a nice pan sauce while the roast is resting...just too late today.  Lovely dish with lovely presentation, nice enough to serve to company.",
