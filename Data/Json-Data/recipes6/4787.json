Just use the second step... saute aromatics in oil, add diced potatoes and corn. Add liquid, cook till potatoes are tender. Press into the pot with the back of your spoon to mash up for thickening or take a little out and blend then put back in. No flour needed. Besides the flour isn't used correctly in the first place... should be added to the fat. This application is correct for corn starch. It shouldn't take 30 minutes start to finish. I replaced the Yukon potato with finely diced carrot and the soy milk with coconut milk (added at the end,) but that's just personal dietary preference. Made a very nice lunch!",

Usually my first try I follow a recipe according to the exact measures and prep however after reading the other comments I made the following modifications - pre-cut sweet potato boiled along with a russet I forgot to reserve any of the water so I used 3 cups of veg broth and 2 cups of coconut milk (so delicious unsweetened) I also added more than a pinch of cayenne and about a 1/2-1 teaspoon of smoked paprika. Oh and 1 cup of sweet baby peas added with the corn. I used gluten-free all purpose flour that I added to the onion celery garlic saut\u00e9ed at the beginning to make a \"roux\" and begin the thickening early. It was so comforting and yummy... I served with baked tofu crusted with old bay seasoned potato chips. Perfect for the day!",

I subbed sweet peas for corn unsweetened coconut milk for almond skipped ginger/celery added a tomato and a TON of wilting parsley.
