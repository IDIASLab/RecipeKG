Substituted Coconut Oil for the vegetable oil used Chia Seeds & Hemp Seeds instead of Flax Seeds because I only had the ground Flax. Used Peppita Seeds instead of sesame seeds. I can't eat raisins so used chopped dates & dried cherries. I also added Walnuts. I accidentally added Baking Powder so they are probably puffy and maybe should've been flat so I tamped them down with a spatula before baking. I increased the seasoning a touch by adding some Allspice & Nutmeg. The smell of them baking makes you stand at the oven & wait for them! YUM.",

I didn't really want to add more fat and sugar on top of the butter and sugar that I had already added so I substituted the oil and honey with a couple of bananas and then cut the WW flour to just 2 cups. I didn't add poppy or flax seeds but loved the taste and texture of the sesame seeds. I also added a cup of butterscotch chips. My kids and husband love them. They're thick and hearty. I think next time I might cut the flour back a little more even to give a slightly less dense texture.",
