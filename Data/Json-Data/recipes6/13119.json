I have been searching for an icing recipe that allows me to bake cookies that look like they were purchased from a designer cookie shop. Thanks to this recipe, my search is over! I've made this icing several times and it has never let me down!  The icing sets up shiny and beautiful and the colors are so bright and glossy.  I use the paste food colorings--that you can purchase at any craft store.  The icing appears \"wet\", but it sets up nicely and you are able to stack the cookies.  However, the icing isn't too hard.  It's perfect.  I've used this icing to make decorated butterfly cookies that most people thought I purchased at a bakery.  I also made heart cookies for Valentine's day.  I packaged them in individual cellophane bags and tied with a ribbon--a cute, inexpensive treat for friends and my children's friends.  This icing's consistency is wonderful, too.  I spoon it on cookies and work it around the shape.  I use a paintbrush to add details, and the end of the paintbrush to add dots.  And yes, I do add additional milk--a 1/2 tsp at a time.  It's not a problem though.  I add small amounts of milk until I get the right constistency.  I can't say enough about this icing and how it has helped me to make gorgeous, professional-looking cookies for all occassions!",

Then I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract (I know it only calls for 1/4 tsp, but you can never use too much vanilla extract) and stirred again until all mixed. Then I added a tablespoon of corn syrup and stirred until evenly mixed. At that point it was the perfect consistency for spreading and drizzling, and perfectly smooth. I tried using gel color to color it and that worked really well, but with another batch I just used regular food coloring and that worked just fine too.\r\n\r\nIt dried very quickly, within 20 minutes I was able to add a second drizzle coat (of another color) without it sinking into the first coat. It took about 90 minutes to dry hard. I had no problem, using a single batch of this icing recipe,  covering a 40-cookie batch of sugar cookies (average size 2\" by 1.5\") with a solid coat and a drizzle coat, and there was still some icing left over. \r\n\r\nWill be using this one again and again! :)",

This recipe was great.  The glaze does take time to dry - overnight is best.  But the colors don't fade and the icing dries shiny, but not too hard.  I made this icing using both almond and lemon extract with superb results for both.  The icing adds that big of extra flavor to boring old sugar cookie recipes but the flavor isn't overbearing.  Cookies come out stackable and easy to transport after drying.  \r\n\r\nThis was my first time ever making decorated cookies and the person who received my cookie gifts asked me if I'd purchased them at a bakery!  So I was very pleased with this recipe and will probably use it forever!",

I did have to add a bit more milk and corn syrup to make it into a spreadable consistancy.  Make sure you don't add too much of either ... otherwise it gets too runny. I used the almond extract as suggested but have also substituted it with clear vanilla and lemon extract. I think any extract will work. It takes a few of hours to harden and is stackable after that. I used a thin layer of this icing with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies Recipe.  This made a thick professional looking cookie.",
