I have made this with many different cheeses and additions.  But I always decrease the basil by 1/2, substitute savory for the oregano decreasing it a bit, and add a dash or two of nutmeg.  I personally like it with gruyere, spinach and a bit of good ham.  My kids like it best with cheddar, spinach and ham or bacon.  My husband likes it mediterranean style with artichokes, spinach and feta.  I  buy pillsbury already made piecrust and cut out smaller circles to fit our muffin pan. Then I put the toppings (different for everyone) in each cup and pour the egg mixture over all.  Then everyone gets a quiche they like. (oh and if you add the spinach make sure you precook it and squeeze most of the moisture out of it or you'll get a mess.)",

First, I fried up about 6 slices of bacon crisp.  I then sauteed the diced onion in 1-2 tbsp. of the bacon grease.  I also omitted the basil and oregano because I don't like them and the other reviews stating that they were a little overpowering.  The rest I followed exactly.  It was delicious!  UPDATE:  I've made this several times now, and it's always a huge hit.  I no longer make it with the mozzarella, I just use all cheddar.  ",

We had no heavy cream, so we used what we had - fat free half & half. It certainly seemed to work, which also means you could use that instead of heavy cream without compromising flavor. We had no ready-made pie crust, so we used the \"Easy Pie Crust\" recipe submitted by Louise on AllRecipes. This pie crust is the easiest one ever, contains no butter (a plus for healthier eaters), and no rolling required--you make it right in the pie pan! What a great match for this phenomenal cheesy quiche! \nNow I've got to see if Donna has other recipes on here!",
