My family members at a couple and then I froze the rest to give away.  I would give the recipe three stars.  The next day, I tried the recipe again making changes suggested by other reviewers.  I used butter instead of shortening and I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar.  These changes made a big difference.  Everybody in my family loved them and gobbled them up.  They had a better peanut butter flavor and texture that we like.  I give the recipe change 5 stars.",

I'd also add that you can change the basic first \"mouth impression\" of the cookie depending on what you criss cross with. Dip your fork in water, shake it off, and put in FLOUR for a richer, chewier cookie, and WHITE granulated SUGAR for a sweeter, slightly more crunchy finish.  Either way, these will disappear fast!  Also, if you use the parchment paper on your cookie sheet, the bottoms will come out more evenly.  YUM!  I'm making some of these today!",

There's nothing unusual or different about these other than that this is just a good recipe for basic peanut butter cookies!  The only thing I felt it needed was vanilla, so I added two teaspoons. Reliable and easy to make.  Good looking peanut butter cookie too, just the right thickness.  Tender and somewhat sandy with crispy edges, just how I like them.  I swore I was only going to taste these just so I could review them but I enjoyed it so much I finished the cookie and had another!  Dependably good on its own, but I threw in a bag of peanut butter/chocolate chips.  Toe curling good.",

I liked the additonal chips in the batter. But I am sure it would have been just fine without them too. ENJOY and make a double batch!",
