The next time I will probably put two small limes instead of one big lime in the cavity and put the onion in between. I think I will cut them as well instead of piercing them with a fork. This chicken came out tender and juicy and there were no left-overs. I did cook the syrup longer than 10 minutes but that wasn't a tragedy. I ended up with a nice sauce to serve with the meat when all was said and done.",
