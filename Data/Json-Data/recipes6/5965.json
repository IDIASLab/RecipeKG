I used ground venison instead of beef; added dried oregano, paprika, and cumin in addition to the chili powder, salt/pepper, and cayenne; used a full red pepper; and added about two tablespoons of tomato paste to the meat mixture. I also added a couple tablespoons of sugar to the cornbread mix. The cornbread batter looks ridiculously thin and liquidy--but don't worry! I spreads over the top of the meat and bakes up perfectly! I topped the cornbread layer with cheese and green onions, just for aesthetics. Will definitely make again, thank you for the recipe!",

Served over shredded lettuce and had sour cream and salsa to top it with. At 425 degrees, casserole was bubbly and the corn bread  brown in twenty minutes, so  watch  time carefully.",
