This makes an absolutely delicious cookie. The directions are excellent and accurate. The only thing I do differently is add 1 T dried orange peel in addition to the orange extract. I've made it with chopped almonds when I'm out of walnuts and it still tastes fabulous. Everyone loves this cookie and it keeps so well in tupperware. It does seem to take twice as long to make because you slice and bake them a second time but don't let that deter you. It is worth it and makes a decent number of cookies. Make sure you watch them brown and turn them once during the browning step. If you have cookie racks it makes the cooling process go much faster. (As does a ceiling fan in the kitchen.) Try these cookies - they are great.",
