I used 1 & 1/2 c. flour 1/2 c. white sugar & 1/2 c. brown sugar and added 1 tsp. of vanilla. This is a versatile recipe because when it comes to that extra 1/3 c. you can add any type of chopped nuts (pecans walnuts almonds) or you could use chocolate chips peanut butter chips etc... It all depends on your taste. I added 1/3 c. of chopped almonds and did a choclate glaze. I hate to say it but I took a look at the frosting and it did look like it would be a bit much so I didn't want to ruin this bread/cake. This is definitely a sweet treat!",

I DID NOT use frosting; I think that it doesn't need it and adding the chocolate chips and sprinkling sugar on the top before baking adds the necessary sweetness. Overall a great bread good for breakfast (if like sweets that early) or a good dessert/snack bread. Quick easy yummy. Definately a keeper.",

I used chocolate chips pulsed through the food processor instead of nuts and did add a tsp. of chocolate extract. After it cooled completely I wrapped it well and put it in the fridge.

If you're looking for a chocolatey bread/cake you'll need to replace the nuts with chocolate chips (I used regular-size semi-sweet chips) and consider adding a teaspoon of vanilla. Don't add cinnamon if you're looking for chocolate since it distracts from what little chocolate flavor there is. This \"bread\" (more like a dense cake) isn't what you need if you're looking for a chocolate fix but it is delicious. I went with my suggested chocolate suggestions above (chips and vanilla) and ate it without the frosting. Chocolatey enough to enjoy but not a chocoholic's dream. Without the chips it wouldn't have really tasted much like chocolate...just a very rich dark-flavored bread (they help bring out the mild chocolate flavor in the bread).",
