Most try udon in soups, but the flavors from a hot pan and excellent sauces make this spicy stir-fried version so much better. I mixed together my concoction of Asian flavors and produced this lovely dish that is great for family, friends, and guests. I promise you they will love it more than your generic Asian takeout.",
