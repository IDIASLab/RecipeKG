This actually tasted very good! It reminds me of an apple pie without the apples...lol! Does that make sense? This pie should be called 'Spiced Custard Pie' because that's basically what it is! I made it exactly as written. The only problem I had with this recipe is that I had to make the filling twice because one batch wasn't enough for my deep dish pie crust. And the other problem was that the directions should state to serve the pie chilled because my pie oozed into a pile of pudding when I cut into it even though I waited for it to cool. Very tasty and interesting recipe! I would make it again!",
