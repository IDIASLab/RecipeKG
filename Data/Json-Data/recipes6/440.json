I wasn't too big on the sauce after the ribs slow-cooked for a while so I made a little of my own sauce to add to it with some honey-bbq sauce teriyaki and brown sugar. After that they came amazing. I had to cook them quite a bit longer in the slow-cooker and on high but they still came out really awesome. My family loved them. I give it 3 stars for giving me a good lead on what to do and a perfect starting point. Also I have the tendency to make every recipe into my own.",

I had every intention of doing so - but my boyfriend is notorious for adding things while my back was turned (since he knows I freak out on him when I catch him). He added 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar. Well it was FANTASTIC!!! I couldnt wait until I made it again (with him NOT around to to tamper with the recipe)PROPERLY to rate so it's a definite 5 and a suggestion to try it:) Thank you for the yummy recipe!",
