As per the recipe I made the cookie using 1 oz. of almond paste. When I came up with soup for the dough I decided something was wrong and used the rest of the can of almond paste (8 oz. total) which made the dough much better though still very soft. But I went ahead with the dough and the cookies came out fine. I think next time I will use medium eggs instead of large but definitely still use the 8 oz. of almond paste. With the filling I found it easier to work with after I had cooled it completely and it had almost solidified. With the glaze I found the warmer the better otherwise it was thicker than I liked. But overall this is a great recipe and I will make it again and again!!! Thank you Marge!",

Adding only 1 oz. results in a soupy batter that made a complete mess of the kitchen. I think perhaps you meant 11 oz which is what i used after i cleaned the entire kitchen threw out the original soup batter and started from scratch.",
