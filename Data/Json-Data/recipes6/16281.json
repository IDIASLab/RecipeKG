I made some very creamy Cheddar cheesy mashed potatoes andmixed into the browned turkey, then just for the helluva it, added some chopped steamed broccolli. filled the dough circles with this and baked and O MY HEAVENS. Family couldn't stop raving. Served with corn chowder, peanut butter cookies for dessert. All on a rainy blustery day. Thanks for the inspiration. What I made doesn't begin to be the original which I'm sure is wonderful too. But it was darned good!",

Made a vanilla glaze from this site and added some cinn to it also. Husband and son said it could use more of the Br. sugar cinn mix. Next time :)Great way to use up leftovers.",

But this recipe turned out perfect for me! When it came to the dough I did refrigerate for about 4 hours, I also coated the bowl with vegetable oil and rolled the dough in it so it was covered in oil. I did not use any flour to press out my dough pieces. I cut recipe for dough in half (left the filling the same) and it made exactly 10, with a small amount of filling left over. They were gorgeous- just like the first picture that's posted! I did add lots of seasoning to the filling. If you are scared at all about working with bread dough do NOT be- this recipe is awesome. I plan to use it for dinner rolls, cinnamon rolls, pizza pockets, etc. Thanks Pam!!!",
