Cook time double.\n\nMy family did not care for the texture.  The flavor was good though, and I liked the healthy ingredients, so decided to give it a second try.\n\nSecond time, to make it less chunky: Substituted peanut butter for pecans, 1 additional cup apple sauce for apples and raisins, milk for almond milk.   Cook time double.\n\nIt went over a bit better with everyone, but still wasn't a hit.  That said, I kept eating them, so there was certainly something appealing about it.  I think it may be that we don't care for the texture of baked oatmeal--we usually eat regular oatmeal or overnight oats.  I'm pretty confident even if we had followed the recipe perfectly, it wouldn't have been better received because of the texture.  That's why I took off a star.  However, 4 stars for a good flavor, for being healthy, and for enjoying them myself.  I thought they were best fully cooled and the next day--didn't last past that :-)  I would say it's worth a try if the ingredients look good to you.  Thanks for sharing!",
