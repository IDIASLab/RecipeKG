Ended up adding 3 tbs. of flour extra from the ingredients as listed to get the \"tacky\" feel to the dough (it's been very rainy here). Definitely rose too much -- filled my 2lb machine with 1 1/2 lb ingredients listed but suspect that might be using liquids which were too warm rather than too much flour. Will definitely try again with cold liquids. Made again with cold liquids. Only had to add 1 tbs of extra flour to get nice elastic dough. Still filled my 2lb machine.",
