Here is what I did (and I won't change a thing the next time I make it): 1. Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt.  Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag.  Shake beef in bag to coat.  Saut\u00e9 coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned.  Add chopped onion to beef to saut\u00e9 and soften.  Transfer to slow cooker.  2.  Mix beef broth (I used Swanson's Certified Organic in aseptic carton) with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and \u00bd cup red wine.  Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker.  3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions:  increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning.  Your home will smell wonderful all day, and your meal will be a savory feast!  I served the stew in bowls, accompanied by slices of fresh, crusty bread.",

I make minimal changes (I like parsnips, so I add three chopped in place of celery, and I add a little more broth because I like more gravy), but that's about it. This is one of those easy, homey, stick-to-your-ribs recipes. Some of the reviews tick me off: Yes, it's a \"regular\" stew recipe because it is, after all, STEW. And all the changes that other reviewers make? Don't say \"I made this recipe, but I changed EVERYTHING about it.\" You aren't doing this recipe justice.. heck, you aren't doing THIS recipe at all. I'm as guilty of changing recipes to suit my tastes and pantry as much as anyone, but at least tell us that you've made the original recipe as written before doing your million-and-one changes!
