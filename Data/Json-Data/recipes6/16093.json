                "reviewBody": "I have to agree with sunnnij this recipe really highlights the flavor of the corn. There seem to be three categories of this type of recipe: cakey custardy or souffl\u00e9-like and varying degress of sweetness. This results in more of a custard with the perfect balance of sweetness to my taste. Of course I realize that that is a strictly personal preference and preferences vary. I used to use a recipe that my Mom gave me which is quite similar but had less corn more milk and twice the sugar flour and eggs. Since I prefer canned corn to preserve the exact proportion of corn as specified in the recipe I used kitchen scales to weigh out 16 oz of canned Niblets corn from two 11 oz cans which left 3.5 oz of corn leftover from the second can... I expect just using the two 11 oz cans would work fine. The texture was more custard like which I really liked. To prevent excessive clumps that other reviewers mentioned I put the flour and sugar into the mixing bowl then added the 3/4 cup of cold milk and whisked vigorously then added the egg and whisked again. (Never try to add flour to any liquid that is not really cold as the flour will immediately create lumps that will be impossible to eliminate without a sieve). Then I nuked it for 20 seconds or so to warm it to about room temperature before adding the melted butter and corn. Baked as specified and it came out perfect. This is definitely replacing the recipe my Mom gave me (sorry Mom!).",

The color is wonderful when baked, as it turns a nice orange on top and is very attractive. It is important to defrost and drain the corn of any extra water before using it, as the final product is a wonderful consistency when done. Thank you for the recipe!",

I tried it low for an hour. It wasn't doing much so I switched it to high for the last three hours. It tasted pretty good. I also tried cutting a corner. I threw the corn in frozen instead of thawing and drying it. The corn was sweet in a mushy mixture. Maybe if I would have thawed and dried the corn it would have come out better.",
