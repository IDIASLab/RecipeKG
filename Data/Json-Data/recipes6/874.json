I added steal cut oats Chai seed and Hemp seed as well as the wheat germ. I didn't have coconut but substituted the oil for coconut oil. I didn't use brown sugar I used maybe a 1/3 cup (all that I had) of coconut sugar and about a 1/4 cup or so of organic maple syrup and some stevia. Also cut down the spices. I added dried cranberries pumpkin seeds and almonds. It came out great. I've never made granola before and used this as a guide. I'm surprised more people don't make their own so easy and good. You can see I changed a lot from a very good recipe and worked with what I had.",

                "reviewBody": "I changed it around a little, but loved the recipe!!  I used 1/2 brown sugar-1/2 pure maple syrup (cooked covered in the microwave for 3 mins., prior to adding to the oat mixture).  I added 1/2 teaspoon of maple flavoring to the 1/2 cup of water.  I used whole pecans, hazelnuts, sliced almonds, and whole flaxseeds (just my preference).  I too, thought a teaspoon of salt enhanced the flavor.\nTo cook it, I separated the mixture onto 2 cookie sheets, lined in foil and sprayed with cooking spray.  I placed both pans into the preheated **375 degree** oven for 12 mins. stirring after 6 mins.  I then lowered the heat to 300 degrees, stirred it once more, and returned it to  a 300 degree oven for an additional 6 mins.  I then turned the oven off completely, do not open the oven door to check or stir it again.  The trick is to leave it in the oven until the oven with the granola inside, has cooled down completely..  This cuts the baking time to 18 mins., and makes it all very crunchy, but not overdone!  When it comes out of the oven, completely cooled, I added white raisins, and craisins.  So very yummy.  \nOne last note...after removing the cooled granola from the oven (BEFORE adding the craisins/raisins) reserve 1-2 cups and add chocolate, or carob chips, to to the reserved granola, it's perfect on top ice cream or frozen yogurt!!!",
