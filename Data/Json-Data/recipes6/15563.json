I pulled it off of the smoker and it was the best, juiciest ham I've ever had.  Tasso is traditionally smoked until it is so dry and concentrated that it's rarely eaten by itself.  I was able to get Morton meat cure at our grocery near the salt.  I wasn't able to find smoked paprika, so I added plain.  And I used Mrs. Butterworth's maple flavored syrup instead of honey.  My family loves it!",
