For easier prep I added 1 egg to the batter (thinner pancakes--no slicing necessary) and used 1/4 cup less milk in the almond topping (5min less time in oven). Try 1/3 cup batter per pancake--roll pan to spread batter for large thin 6-8\" diameter crepe-like pancake. 1/8-1/4 cup applesauce filling per pancake. I added a few drops of almond extract into the applesauce filling since I had no almonds on hand and a touch of cinnamon. Served with maple syrup for a deeply flavored breakfast that is not too rich. The crispy edges on the pancakes and puffy juicy insides make an exotic almost French cooking-esque contrast in your mouth. Wow.",
