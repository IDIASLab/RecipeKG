                "reviewBody": "These baked up pretty, delicious and crackly. I followed the recipe exactly.  I had no problem rolling the dough into balls or the sugar.  I tend to like thicker cookies, so on the last cookie sheet I tried not flattening the cookie dough balls at all and, interestingly, it made no difference whatsoever.  They're light, just barely crispy and chewy all at once, and almost literally melt in your mouth.  One thing they're NOT, however, and what made me somewhat disappointed with them, is cinnamon-y!  I'm not so much disappointed in the recipe, I guess, as I am with my own expectations.  The title does begin with \"Cinnamon,\" and I based my expectations on that and the cinnamon chips - I should have had foresight, I suppose, and noticed there was no cinnamon in the dough.  In keeping with the \"Cinnamon Cookie\" idea, were I to make these again I'd try backing off on both the nutmeg and ginger, and add a good amount of cinnamon instead.  This made a LOT of dough, way more than I needed.  But it worked out well because I gave half the dough to a busy friend to bake with her daughter and she was thrilled!  Just another thought...with vanilla extract as pricey as it is, I have my doubts as to whether 2 T. is necessary.  I'd bet that with all the spice in the cookie that you'd notice no difference if that was reduced to 2 teaspoons.  Additionally, the lesser amount of liquid may be all that's needed to help those who found the dough difficult to work with.",

I only made two minor changes and that was to use margarine instead of shortening(I personally don't like using shortening for cookies) and I also only used 1 tsp of nutmeg and ginger. My dough was not \"stiff\" as was indicated it would be. The dough was too gooey to roll so I just scooped it out using my Tablespoon cookie scoop like any other cookie and sprinkled them with sugar before I put them in the oven. Oh and one other thing I could not find light molasses so I used regular. The cookies turned out excellent! This recipe is a keeper! I will definately make them again. Thank you!",

I added an extra 1 c of flour and chilled it. I also did not need to flatten them as they spread when cooked. Cinnamon chips were impossible to find in my area. I substituted butterscotch.
