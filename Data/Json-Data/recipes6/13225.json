I made it the night before and it was so easy.  I did make a few changes. I made 2 recipes of this--one cherry and one blueberry.  I added 1 cup of chopped pecans and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the crust of the blueberry version.  I added 1 cup of chopped toasted almonds to the crust of the cherry version and 1 teaspoon of almond flavoring to the cherry pie filling.  I thought it looked sort of plain so I sprinkled the whipped topping with extra graham cracker crumbs and toasted chopped nuts(almonds for the cherry version and pecans for the blueberry version).  The taste was surprisingly light and deliciously fruity.  I will definitely make this again--in fact I plan to make it for my mom's 4th of July party!!",

Baked for almost an additional 10 minutes! Also cracker crust was way too thick. Recipe needed more filling and less crust. Would probably make again but use a different crust recipe. Crust was too time consuming. Also recipe confusing when listing crust ingredients with filling ingredients. Almost put entire 2 cups of sugar into crust.",
