With the weather turning a bit cooler, I decided to give this recipe a try.  I was not disappointed, and neither was he.  These are absolutely delicious.  I used butter rather than margarine and I used two tablespoons rather than one.  These were light, fluffy and so tender.  I followed the recipe and some of the suggestions by other reviewers.  Mix only until incorporated, add to simmering (not boiling) liquid and put a lid on it!  Leave the pot alone for the full 15 minutes.  This is now our family dumpling recipe.  Thank you Carol's Mom.",

I made them in a food processor IN SECONDS as following! I added the flour, salt, bp, sugar, and the 1 tbsp of dried parsley and pulsed a few seconds. I think butter is much healthier than margarine and followed some reviews and used 2 tablespoons of cold butter, but don't think the extra Tbsp was really necessary.  I pulsed until incorporated, then added the cold milk and pulsed just until the dough pulled together as a ball - not more. I gathered the ball, cut up in pieces with knife, dropped them in my simmering brothy soup and watched them puff up delightfully!-make sure you have enough liquid and let simmer. Do not remove lid during the process!. They tasted awesome and we all loved them. The ingredient ratios are spot on- Don't change anything! EXCELLENT dumplings Carol!",

I remade my batch bc it was just that all gummy and goopy, good thing I cooked them separate from my Chicken Parkiash. \r\n\r\nMake sure your water is a LIGHT boil before you add the dumplings, then reduce to simmer with lid on- (JUST LIKE THE DIRECTIONS INSTRUCT!)so you don't make them tough and chewy. I did just that, plus I don't like the way it changes the texture of the dish when you add directly to the soup/stew-guess it depends on what you were raised on?\r\n\r\nPlus to address those ppl who found it bland, perhaps you should try it again only use real butter, cold from fridge and add more salt, pepper, parsley as the option offers and I added 1 t each onion and garlic powder plus some chicken granulated bullion, just like 1/2t to the dry ingredients, this made an AMAZING recipe.\r\n\r\nOn its own it is quite tasty I only offered the suggestions to those concerns.",
