So when I divided it into 4 I should have used a half an egg or less. These came out quite fluffy. But that was my own fault. Still yummy. I feel like they could have been a bit more chocolately.

I didn't understand the method of folding it into a block or why so I just used a cookie scoop and scooped it. I was expecting so much more taste wise with the idea of chocolate almonds apricot. It just tasted like a \"brownie with fruit and nuts\" in the shape of a flat chewy cookie. The chocolate pieces melted right into it creating a gummy cookie along with the fruit with odd bits of almonds. The texture was just strange to me unless it is my preference. Maybe I was just expecting more than a brownie.",
