I did add some thyme and sage to the stuffing, which complimented the other ingredients well.  Thanks for this excellent recipe!  I will use it for Cornish game hens also.",

I took the recommendation of adding sage and thyme, but also substituted finely chopped walnuts in place of the carrots and used half the amount of parsley.  I substitued bread crumbs for a stuffing mixture and added an extra tablespoon.  Also, instead of brushing the quail with bacon drippings, I wrapped the stuffed quail in bacon before broiling.",
