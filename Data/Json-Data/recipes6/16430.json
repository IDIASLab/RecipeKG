Although I used a young starter (only 5 days old), I got a distinct sourdough flavor for my effort. My only deviations from the recipe as written were to (1) break the dough up into 2 loaves & bake in loaf pans for 30 minutes each @ 375 and (2) I brushed olive oil over the tops & sprinkled w/ diced onion. This recipe will be around for a long time - can't wait to try it once my starter is even further established.",

The frozen dough we use during the week to make sourdough pizza, which is also a great hit. :) The dough freezes very well, and just needs to defrost at room temp for 2 to 3 hours, and then raise in a warmed oven with a bowl of water for at least 30-40 mins.",

                "reviewBody": "I found this to be too unstable it does not use enough flour. My dough wanted to puff too much while rising & it deflated no matter how careful I was while handling even though I was careful not to over-rise & the temps while rising were not excessive (maybe 70 light on oven off no drafts) Also the oven temp is too high to cook the inside until hollow. The crust was way beyond brown not appealing & I had two loaves. I researched technique & tried another recipe which turned out amazing....Tips that helped the other recipe were that.... too little flour & not enough kneading made unstable deflatable dough. (10 min. in my kitchenaide with the dough hook was perfect) & then to def. use an eggwash (I used melted butter first then eggwash & the crust was chewy & crispy and PRETTY) not dry crumbly & burnt. Preheat your oven for 50 min at 400 with a stone on the lowest rack. Let your bread do it's final rise on a greased/cornmealed metal pan & then set the pan right onto the hot stone in the preheated oven. The hot stone helped cook the inside perfectly. Put a ramekin of hot water on the floor of your oven for steam. Spritz the walls with water often for 5-10 min. Bake for 10 min. then turn heat to 370 for 20-30 min. I think technique is what bread is all about & this recipe lacks technique. I'm sorry for the review I DID like the flavor. I'll try the ingred. again sometime but with these changes.",
