I only used 2 cups of sugar instead of 3 because everyone was saying how sweet it was. Also, i added an extra half cup of eggnog, as everyone was saying it was too crumbly and dry. I cut it before it was fully finished hardening up to prevent any breakage as well. My boyfriend loved it and ate quite a few pieces. It is still super sweet even with only 2 cups of sugar. I might try 1 1/2 cups next time.  Tip: Make sure you put it in a 9x9 pan because it was way too thin in a 9x13. ",

I was very disappointed. I searched the net and found some other versions of this recipe and several stressed the importance of using regular not low-fat eggnog - so I think that was my critical error. I tried it again with regular eggnog and a few other modifications I saw in other comments: 2 c. sugar only 5 minutes on the second boil 1/2 t. rum extract and I used an 8 x 8 pan. It turned out perfect this time and I can't wait to serve it on Christmas Day!",
