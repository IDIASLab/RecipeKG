Adding enough mustard to make it thicker like the recipe suggests would have made the mustard flavor far too strong. As a marinade it would be perfect the way it is. To make it thick enough to be a dipping sauce I added about 1/2 tsp of cornstarch and heated it on the burner for a few minutes while stirring. That did the trick and made it just the right consistency.",
