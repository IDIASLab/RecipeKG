Instead of chocolate chips I used white chocolate chips. My boyfriend liked the cake but I found it very gritty/granular tasting. The granularity seemed to be the cake mix rather than the sugar (which some reviewers had commented about). But definitely a moist cake! Initally the batter seems to be very thick. Also I think I would have added more cherry pie filling to make it a thinner batter - that might help with the grittiness.",

My six year old and I made this together and got rave reviews. We frosted the cake then put it in the fridge overnight. It was absolute divinity thanks! EDIT: I made this cake again for a birthday party. To keep the cherries from settling on the bottom I added 1/2 cup of the cake mix to the cherries in a separate bowl. Added the eggs to the remaining cake mix roughly mixed then added the cherry mixture and mixed until barely combined but not enough to break up the cherries too bad. I also added 1 tsp of almond extract. I baked for 18 minutes in muffin cups and frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this recipe. It was the TALK of the office!",
