Also, it is a wonderful clean-out-the-fridge, use-your-imagination, I-just-bounced-five-checks recipe. It reheats well too. You can use margarine or olive oil in place of the butter, and you can use apple juice or white grape juice in place of the wine.",

Having experimented over time, I now add a dash of light cream at the end and stir it through and this makes a big difference and brings it closer to a traditionally made risotto.  I vary the recipe depending on what I have in the fridge and often add semi-dried tomato, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, onion, baby spinach, a can of chopped tomatoes (including the liquid), cheese or chicken.

I added sauteed mushrooms and, as one of the other reviewers suggested, caramelized the onions and added them in the last few minutes of cooking instead of throwing them in raw with the rice. I did have to cook the rice an extra five minutes in order to cook the rice through. I would also suggest checking up on the rice and mixing it halfway through both times of cooking. If the rice appears a little dry just add more water or wine. Sauteed mushrooms in wine and butter seasoned with salt and pepper are a great touch. *I kept the lid on though not very tightly just to cover up but still letting the steam from cooking come through* Overall, a delicious meal to prepare in little time!",

AND tho you have to fiddle w/ it a little to make it as good as slaving over the stove, it is worth it!\r\n\r\nMy modifications: 1) Added mushrooms and leftover (cooked) chicken midway during the last 10 min cooking bit.  Also added more veggie broth at that time (about 1/2-3/4 more than called for in the recipe).  2) Changed the ORIGINAL liquid proportions, as well: 2 cups veggie broth and 1/4 cup RED (yes red) wine 3) increased the cooking time by 2-3 minutes to get the rice done (I think i have an underpowed nuker.)  4) Probably added a little extra cheese, too.

I made mine with half butter & half olive oil all chicken broth for the liquids and I stirred in 2 tablespoons of prepared pesto sauce at the end. Also I stirred it halfway through both cooking times to help release more starch and make it creamier. It was a bit oily but that could be from the added oil in the pesto. I am excited to have a risotto recipe that will be bearable to make in the steamy summer months when slaving over a boiling pot for 30 minutes is not my favorite activity.",

Most importantly though I sauteed some crimini mushrooms with butter and wine and added it at the end with the wine. Amazing! I too kept the lid on don't know if I was suppose to do that.
