I used 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. ground italian sausage. I cooked this first then removed it from the pan draining ALL the grease. Then I cooked the onion and garlic (omitted bell pepper) in just a little olive oil added back the meat and added flour. We don't like a chunky sauce so I used a 29 oz. can plus a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce and omitted the chopped tomatoes. I added spices and wine as written but substituted fresh ground black pepper for the cayenne. I found that after simmering for a couple of hours it was just too thick for our taste so I added about 1 cup of water to get a nice consistency. Be sure to stir often or sauce on the bottom will char and it could ruin the whole pot of sauce. Thinning the sauce out a bit helps avoid this also. I recommend omitting the regular salt altogether or at least wait till the very end and only add as much as needed. Also taste at the end and if too acid add a bit more sugar and 1 or 2 Tbsp. butter. Both of these things help cut the acid. I used half for spaghetti and froze the rest to use another day.",

I made it for a church gathering and within minutes not only was it gone but people were asking me for the recipe. I tweaked the recipe based other other reviewers' recommendations: I used only 2 T of olive oil 1 onion a 29 oz can of tomato sauce only 1/2 t. of cayenne and it was perfect for my taste. I also drained the fat before I added the flour. It took 3 hours to simmer and a little chopping but other than that it was simple and well-worth the extra wait. \"Arriverderci!\" to Ragu and Prego.",
