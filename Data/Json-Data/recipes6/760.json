I admit I was skeptical, but it was a long day and I really didn't want to do all my usual prep work for Sloppy Joes. Alissa to the rescue! I made this exactly as written, and OMG, it was good. I admit to liberal sampling while I waited for the liquid to simmer down. I wouldn't change a thing, except perhaps adding some diced peppers next time. But really, that would just be showing off. The recipe was a hit as written, and in about an hour from now I'll clean the kitchen by licking the leftovers from the skillet!",
