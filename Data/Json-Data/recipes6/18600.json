It is hearty- definitely not like those \"air\" boxed cakes.  A tip for those that find the cake to grainy or dry:  Don't use cake flour! Use all purpose! Put a little more milk in for desired consistency and moistness and by all means when mixing the butter and the sugar together go as long as 10 minutes or until it is smooth.  The smoother the butter and egg are the less grainy it will be!",

I used 3 eggs instead of two and creamed them along with the butter and sugar for 10 minutes. AngieMonty was right,the smoother the butter mixture,the smoother the cake. I also used cake flour and whole milk and baked it in round layers for exactly 40 minutes,the least amount of time called for. I frosted it with chocolate frosting and it disappeared in record time. I have found my cake recipe. Thanks Scottley!!!",

In fact, I\u2019d call it perfect, with no need to change anything let alone search for a better recipe. If you follow the directions and cream the butter and sugar to aerate the batter and give it lift, if you add the eggs one at time to keep the batter emulsified, you will get fantastic results, a superior cake.  But I think that maybe some inexperienced bakers, wanting to make sure they do it right and \u201cbeat the heck\u201d out of the butter and sugar, might actually take it too far \u2013 you CAN overbeat a cake batter!  The cake is only lightly sweet, but I liked that.  I don\u2019t know who would plan to eat this without a rich, sweet frosting, and the two together create the proper creamy, moist, fluffy, sweet lusciousness you want.  (And I\u2019m not exaggerating for effect) This is light with a tender crumb \u2013 if you need a cake for sculpting or carving this would NOT be a good choice. But if you want a fluffy, light, stick-to-your-fork moist white cake, give Scottley\u2019s a try.  I baked this as cupcakes \u2013 one-half recipe makes 12 perfect cupcakes.  Bake at 350 degrees, 18-20 minutes.",

If you use a skim milk, the cake will be less rich than if using whole milk.  I used skim milk and margarine rather than butter.  Butter provides a better flavor, but margarine creams better and incorporates more air into the batter.  My layers only took 30 minutes to bake...maybe some people over-cooked the cake.  As mentioned by another evaluator, the toothpick method is the only sure way of checking for doneness.  I do want to mention that if this cake tastes like a cornbread, then honey, you need to try REAL cornbread.  Most restaurant cornbread and box mixes taste like cake.",
