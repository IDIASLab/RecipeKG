To vary the flavor, I sometimes omit the red wine vinegar and use 1 1/2T rice vinegar and 1/2t sesame oil. This give the salad a more Oriental taste. Caution when using the sesame oil, a little goes a very long way. Very potent taste!",

I call it 'BROCCOLI SLAW, RAMEN' in my recipe file, and have tweaked it somewhat from the original.  \r\n\r\nDifferences:  \r\n\r\nDRESSING: I use 'Oriental flavored' Ramen, use only about 1/4 cup oil (don't need more), use rice vinegar instead of red wine, and add a few shakes of cayenne pepper as well as the black pepper and salt. I don't bother heating dressing, either.\r\n\r\nSALAD:  Break up Ramen noodles into small pieces, and saute in a couple of Tbsp. butter with the almonds (2-3 Tbsp.) and sesame seeds (2 Tbsp.) until slightly change color. Set aside.\r\n\r\nCombine broccoli slaw (my packages seem to come in 12 oz. pkgs, instead of 16 oz.) and dressing at least 15-20 minutes ahead of serving, stirring several times.  Just before serving add the sauteed noodles, almonds and sesame seeds to top, don't stir them in completely or they lose their crispness.\r\n\r\nI love serving this salad with crab cakes, they add a little cachet to the menu, and I've never found anyone who didn't rave about it!",
