My recommendations:  Use more butter to keep the crust together, bake the crust for 10 minutes at 350 and then let cool before adding the remaining ingredients, reserve 1/3 of the caramels to melt for a topping, and I always add a tablespoon of flour to my cheesecakes to keep the cake dense and not gooey.  Also, toast extra pecans to use as a topping with the caramel.  This baking method works great and the crust won't crack:  Bake at 450 for 10 minutes, turn oven down to 250 without opening the oven and bake for 30 minutes, then turn oven off (still without opening the oven) and leave cake in another 30 minutes.  And be sure to make and add 50% more filling to make a higher cake.",

I used an Oreo cookie crust (increased the butter to 6 TBL), baked it for 10 minutes at 350 and refrigerated it overnight before adding the caramel and pecans.  As suggested by others, I brought the crust up about 1 inch on the sides of the springform pan and doubled the amount of cheesecake filling. I used a hot water bath (wrapped the pan in heavy-duty foil and placed it in an oven bag) and baked at 450 for 10 minutes, turned the oven down to 250 without opening the oven and baked for 30 minutes, then turned the oven off (still without opening the oven) and left the cake in another 60 minutes.  The cheesecake was perfect--not a single crack!  I refrigerated the cheesecake overnight, then made a ganache (1/4 cup heavy cream, brought just to a boil, stir in a couple of handfuls of chocolate chips until melted, cool slightly) which I poured over the top.  I sprinkled chopped pecans over the ganache and drizzled caramel ice cream topping over that, then refrigerated until serving. VERY rich, but wonderfully decadent!",

I have to say, this is one of the best (I know everyone always includes that little cliche when writing a review) cheesecakes I've ever made.  I just had 2 adjustments that I made to the recipe:  1) I used a whole package of oreo cookies crushed up and added to melted butter as the crust, and 2) definately use Kraft caramels and not some off brand such as Brach's caramels.  I have made this twice since Christmas and can't make it fast or often enough for my family and friends.  It truly is wonderful and you won't be disappointed.",

Other than that absolutely flawless! And yes adding a chocolate glaze will send to into orbit! Thank you!!!",
