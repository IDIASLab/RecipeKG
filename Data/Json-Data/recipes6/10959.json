I also got tired of waiting for the sugar and evaporated milk to thicken so after about 10-20 mins of waiting I added the other ingredients. I put it in the kitchen aid mixer while it cooled off. It has a fantastic flavor and it's not very thick. It drizzled down the side of my cake and I have a feeling that the icing will still be soft tomorrow. Great recipe! Thank you",
