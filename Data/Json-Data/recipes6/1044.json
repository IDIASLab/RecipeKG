I was very dubious at first, but I went ahead, made it with fresh sweet potatoes (not canned, as they are not available in Canada), made my own adjustments and gave it a go. The finished product looked, smelled and tasted FANTASTIC! Not mushy, and the flavors mingle beautifully! People are pleasantly surprised when they taste it. Enjoy!",

If you aren't big on curry, add less but do not omit, you can add more later but it takes baking time for the flavor to develop. \n450 burned the top if left uncovered, so I baked the others at 375 until the sweet potatoes were tender (cut smaller to cook faster).  The flavor is amazing, I can't stop eating it.  I like it with a dollop of vanilla yogurt. I will be making this for potluck.",

                "reviewBody": "So I think I may have screwed up somewhere along the line. Like db I don't eat canned anything so I used 5 fresh pears (25 oz before peeling/coring) 3 large apples (29 oz before peeling/coring) and about 13 oz of fresh pineapple (I subbed apples for peaches). The 2 cups of sweet potatoes were totally lost in the fruit. I more than doubled the sweet potato and it was still lost in all the fruit but I couldn't add anymore because the pan was full. As the other reviewers' recommended I baked covered until the sweet potatoes were soft then took the cover off and baked another 15 min more. It was super juicy. The curry flavor was totally diluted by all the juice. Now I realize probably one large apple and 1 - 2 pears the pineapple would have been plenty of fruit. Also a shake of salt really brings out the flavor.",

I cooked it longer because we were having company and the meat took longer than expected and I think it benefited from the extra time. I did cook it covered until the sweet potatoes were soft then uncovered to allow some juice to cook off. It goes great with pork. It was a big hit. i recommend it!!!",
