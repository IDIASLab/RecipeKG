I didn't have Garam Masala and couldn't find it during my shopping trip but looked up a recipe for it and just used a pinch of each item I had on hand. I also used a splah of masala wine I had from another soup I made recently. I think the wine adds a nice depth. It was really delicious. As a \"pescatarian\" I do sometimes like to try Vegan recipes and this was a great one. I was surprised by the ease of making cashew cream. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!",
