I served it to my unsuspecting meat-eating family and it went completely undetected and there were no left-overs! Everyone loved my \"chicken wing dip\" and no one noticed it wasn't real chicken :-D Even my tofu-hating father had like four helpings!\r\n\r\nFour stars because the chicken substitute tbe recipe calls for is terrible but my fix was perfect :) Try it again with textured vegetable protein flakes if it didn't turn out right for you with the other chicken substitutes. I know it sounds gross but it really is the best. And remember, buffalo wing sauce is NOT the same as hot sauce ;)",
