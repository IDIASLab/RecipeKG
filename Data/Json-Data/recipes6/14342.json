Make no mistake - in our minds this was a tart/sweet, lemony, buttery, moist CAKE.  I had to settle for only about 1-1/2 tsp. of lemon zest - it was all I had.  But the cake didn't seem to be compromised by it at all - in fact, I might just use that same amount the next time I make this - because it was good, just as I made it.  The crowning touch is the lemon glaze. To ensure the sugar was dissolved I made a syrup of the lemon juice and sugar, heating it to a boil.  Worked perfectly and the resulting syrup was gorgeous.  Rather than drizzling it over the cake I brushed in on gradually as it absorbed into the cake.  Besides for contributing great flavor and moisture, it made the cake shiny and pretty.  This is lovely.",

I also omitted the glaze.  It turned out both moist and sweet even with the cutbacks.  I'd recommend to those having trouble with sinking blueberries to beat a longer time after the addition of each egg - it fluffs up the batter more and hold the berries in place.",

I just sprinkled each muffin lightly with sugar before putting the muffin pan in the oven. 350* for twenty minutes was just right. I got exactly 12 muffins out of this recipe that were medium sized. The flavor of this quick bread was quite good, I really adore the combination of lemon and blueberries. I think next time, I'd add more blueberries but as is, this is a really excellent quick bread recipe. NOTE: I did not cream my butter with the sugar. I just melted the butter, cooled it a bit, then folded it in with the rest of the wet ingredients. I wisked the dry ingredients together and then folded them into the wet until just moistened to prevent toughness and overmixing.",

First of all, and this may be a typing error, but as another reviewer stated, it is not possible to cream sugar with melted butter and get a light and fluffy mixture.  Therefore, I creamed room temp butter with 1/3 sugar for approx 5 min, then added one egg at a time (beating at least 5 min in between each addition).  Also, I only used 1/2 cup sugar, and this was more than enough for us.  And finally, I used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  The end result was a light, airy cake-like bread that was delicious.  As a side note, my blueberries did not sink at all.  I washed them, let them air dry, and then mixed them with the dry ingredients.",
