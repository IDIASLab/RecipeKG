I was afraid this would become a bland mess of stuff mixed together but was amazed how you can taste each and every ingredient separately and yet each one goes so well together with the others... Will be making this again SOON! A",

It's punch comes from the combination of pepper and mango-- I recommend using only white pepper as it's intense bite is a nicer compliment to the mango. Yet if you only have black pepper you will still create a great tasting salad. We enjoy this with Seared Scallops with Spicy Papaya Sauce (found on allrecipes.com)",
