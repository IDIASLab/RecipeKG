BUT I must have done something wrong, because the heaps of cookiedough just sort of melted and my final result was a thin layer of cookie-like substance where I could taste a bit too much of egg. This is probably my own fault as I am a 16 year old guy who just tried to bake for his first time ever :)",

I also used milk chocolate chips in place of the white chocolate ones since my family doesn't care for white chocolate.  The cookies were firm on the outside, soft and chewy inside.  I loved the fact that I didn't have to use brown sugar.  I will keep this in my recipe file for a quick cookie recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!",

They end up as a mound cookie vs. a round flat one but I like it. Perhaps i should flatten them with my meat tenderizer mallet....waffle pattern side down but I don't know. I may try it. Just happy with how it goes at this time. Yummo!",
