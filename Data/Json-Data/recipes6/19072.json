Just in case anyone is having a dificult time finding the 3 oz. box of jello it's actually 0.3 oz. I used the sugar free kind and light cool whip. I poured the mix into the mold before adding the blackberries and refrigerated it overnight. It came out of the mold beautifully although I left it in the warm water a little too long(the top melted just a tiny bit). I will definitely use this recipe again.",

I put the timer on for an hour so I wouldn't accidently allow the jello to gel completely and it really didn't look that thickened to me but I went ahead and whipped it and added the remaining ingredients anyway. It worked perfectly fine. It does take some whisking so be prepared for some exercise or use a mixer. I used my stand mixer and it probably needed about 3-4 minutes on high speed to fluff up. I put some in 4 6 oz ramekins and the rest in a 2 quart bowl (I don't have a jello mold) and it filled the 2 quart bowl a little over half full so this does get a number of servings. I guess I didn't grease the ramekins that well bc a little bit stuck to it. It's sort of a pale lime green color; my picture doesn't do it justice unfortunately--it just looks off white in the pic.:o( Thanks for the recipe!",

I had a larger container of whipped topping, didn't feel like doing the math, so folded in two cups.
