I tweaked it a bit by using traditional old-fashioned oats instead of quick oats (all I had on hand).  I added one extra cup of oats (3 c. total), a dash of cinnamon, and a 1/2 bag of white chocolate chips (they were in the pantry!) to the printed recipe.  This is truly the BEST cookie I have ever had.  Perfect texture, sweetness, and flavor.  My kids are loving them and they usually don't like oatmeal cookies.  We will make this one again and again.

There is a different texture to them, depending if you use margerine or butter. With margerine I find them to be more thick. But using butter is definately my choice. I find that it gives them a better flavor. Personally, I don't add the raisins but just add more craisins to it. Even fussy kids who don't like raisins love them! If you're looking for a great cookie recipe, definately choose this one!!",
