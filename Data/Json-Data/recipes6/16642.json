I'm from the eastern MN/western WI area and LOVED a particular brand of French dressing that began with an \"H\" and was a French man's name (not sure if I can actually share it here) which is very hard-to-find and anything close to it is non-existent here in the Mesa AZ area. This tastes almost EXACTLY like it! I love that I can tweak it so it's healthier - without all the added preservatives and sugar fillers. As per previous suggestions I substituted Splenda for sugar (I used 2/3 c. Splenda) used a 6 oz. can of tomato paste instead of the ketchup and omitted the blue cheese to save on cal's and my glycemic index. YUM! If you love traditional French dressing somewhere in taste between Catalina California and Western THIS IS A MUST-TRY. Bonus: SO EASY TO PREPARE! Thanks for sharing JIMBOWERS. It's definitely a permanent add-in to my recipe box and I'm sharing with all my friends and family too =D",
