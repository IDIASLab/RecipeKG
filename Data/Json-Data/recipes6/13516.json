I topped it with fresh strawberries and blueberries. If you're looking for a lighter dessert this one is a good choice.",

                "reviewBody": "Loved it. This is a custard-style pie not the drier ricotta pies I have had from bakeries. I modified the recipe and am happy with my results. The biggest improvement: I used a small whisk to push the custard through a sieve prior to baking. It took away most lumpiness and made a silkier pie. You can still feel the ricotta texture but its blended into the custard. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla was liberal with the lemon and sugar and only lightly beat the whites. I used 1 cup light cream and 1 cup milk (its what i had on hand) and all proportions were great. I know I made a lot of changes - even if you follow it exactly definitely spend the extra 10 minutes to push through a sieve. I topped it with fresh berries and it was a hit for Easter. Another big tip is to cool it thoroughly (several hours or overnight) at room temperature before refrigerating to avoid the 'sweating' effect.",
