In the batter,  I used 2 large eggs and didn't double the baking powder.  Just before putting in the oven  - I sprinkled the batter with cinnamon.  It came out perfect - inverted the pan on a platter and served with the pecan side up.  Made it extra rich by serving with a combo of melted butter and syrup, with a side of bacon.  Was a real treat - like a dessert - cross between a sticky bun and pancake!  DH loved it!!",

I agree that this doesn't feed 16 between me and my boys we finished the 9 squares it made and they still wanted more. Also I did a breakdown of the calories and 1/9th of a piece equals around 192 calories add 1/4 cup of syrup to 2 pieces and you have an additional 210 calories. I had 2 squares 1/4 cup syrup and 8 oz of orange juice then added the calories up and was disappointed to find I had consumed over 700 calories for breakfast. So I guess if you are watching your weight this is not the recipe for you. Needless to say I won't be eating much the rest of the day. Otherwise great for kids.",

For those who said it was bland do you not realize that pancakes are supposed to be served with margarine or butter and syrup??? The batter is sweet... I only used 1 1/2 tsp white sugar 1 tsp of baking powder and forgot to add the salt. (Good thing... baking powder has enough sodium in it anyway!) Hubby said this goes in my repertoire. Thanks for the recipe! You ROCK! UPDATE: Once again we were out of pancake mix and (amazingly) we had the ingredients on hand -- Made it again -- without the caramelized topping... OMG!!!! (as the kids say) Melt in your mouth absolutely fantastic -- It's easy and fills you up (but it does not feed 16 servings -- okay so the measurements were made to make it attractive to calorie counters -- it does not make this recipe bad! -- This is definitely a keeper (and so much cheaper then pancake mix!)",
