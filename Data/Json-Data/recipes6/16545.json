This is really quick and simple to make great change from traditional and a hit at holiday gatherings. People who don't normally care for cranberry give it a taste and most often fall in love. Gwynn I was gonna post this one but you beat me to it! Enjoy as will we!",

I placed the crushed pineapple in a small-holed colander and pressed it with a large spoon to get out all the juice. I did the same thing with the frozen strawberries that I had already thawed (after I cut them to smaller pieces). I would have liked to have used fresh strawberries but they are too expensive at this time of the year where I live. I was pleasantly surprised that this dish remained fresh (in a sealed container) for at least three days after Thanksgiving. I plan to make this a traditional side dish for my upcoming annual Thanksgiving meals.",
