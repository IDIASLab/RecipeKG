I used 1/4 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice.  I added 2 cloves of garlic minced and 1/2 teaspoon of dried oregano and 1 tablespoon of fresh chopped parsley.  I even left out the green pepper, cucumber and feta cheese and this was great.  It tastes just like the Greek potato salad my mother-in-law always makes.  This is great for picnics because it tastes best served at room temperature and you can leave it setting out and you don't have to worry about it spoiling because there is no mayo.  Everyone loved this and my husband is always looking for leftovers.  We make this all the time, over and over again and everyone asks for this now instead of the potato salad with mayonnaise.  Great recipe!",

I actually only added a couple splashes of lemon juice and that was enough for me. I used half the amount of feta the recipe called for and I think that was perfect! Not too tangy for those that don't like tangy cheese. Otherwise I used the recipe as stated. Oh I also used tri color bell peppers. This salad has a wonderful mix of textures! I cut up my potaoes and veggies very chunky. My whole family thought it was great. Thanks.",

A number of the guests came up to my sister (mother of the graduate) and I proclaiming that we had the \"best ever\" open house fare. This potato salad was incredibly colorful and beautiful (we used red yellow and orange peppers along with red onions). The flavor is tangy and sassy. FIVE STARS!!!!!",
