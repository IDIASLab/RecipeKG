I didn't have nuts so added a little more coconut and also added some chopped marachino cherries for color and flavor.  Also added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract.  I really didn't measure the banana and pineapple.  Had some pineapple rings in juice leftover in the fridge so just cut the rings into bite size pieces and added the juice.  Had 2 ripe bananas.  Added 1 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. each cinnamon and nutmeg.  Added just a hint of flavor and was a nice layering of all flavors from the fruits and spice.  Baked up perfectly and rose like a picture.  Nice to give away.",

I used 1 cup 10grain flour 1 cup quinoa flour and 2 cups white. I also added 1tsp coconut extract and 3/4 cup shredded cocunut. I think the magical trick to making these melt in your mouth is to really cream that butter and sugar like it says too. That helps these fluff up beautifully even with less butter than called for. I made 4 minis loaves and 12 large muffins with this recipe. I am guessing the loaves will freeze well and the muffins will be gone today! Will make again for sure!",
