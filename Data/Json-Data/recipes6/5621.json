I shortened the cooking time by 2 hrs by using canned black & great northern beans and mixing everying in a stock pot on my stovetop. My gut also told me the 1/2 cups brown sugar was way too much so I reduced the amount to 1/4 (not packed). It's still sweeter than most chilies but adding the vinegar and spices tones this down quite a lot. My husband loved this and I will definitely make this again.",

Needed several tweaks.\" I had such high hopes for this chili especially since upon walking in the door from work I salivated at its chirping-in-the-crockpot-all-day aroma. Unfortunately I couldn't get over the overwhelming tomato sauce taste. I followed the recipe exactly as written w/ the exception of using fresh cilantro (1/4 c. finely-chopped) instead of dried and reducing the brown sugar to 1/4 c. (Although should I make this again I would probably drop it to 2 TB instead.) For all of the wonderful flavors that went into it I just tasted what I could only describe as tomato soup w/ chicken and beans. It's a good recipe that just needs a few changes such as less tomato sauce or none at all (possibly a small can tomato paste and more chicken stock?) and definitely less brown sugar to evolve into a great recipe.",
