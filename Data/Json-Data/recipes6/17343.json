I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 stevia and I didn' have any orange zest. I also used organic raw honey and organic orange juice. Everything else was the same. This was easy and fast and very delicious. I can't wait to have some with a cup of tea tonight.
