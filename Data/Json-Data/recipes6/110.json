I added 2 extra tablespoons of brown sugar and an extra teaspoon of vanilla.  I also added Heath toffee chips (for more texture) as I have seen in similar recipes.  Oh, and I let this sit over night.  At first, I served the dip with chocolate graham crackers, which were good, but then my husband had the fantastic idea to dip small pretzels in it.  The salty/sweet combo was perfect!  Next time, I may even add some crushed pretzels to the dip rather than the Heath chips.  The salt of the pretzels really complimented the sugar in the dip!  I will definitely make this dip again!",

After several attempts at tweaking, I\u2019ve decided that I like it best using the mini semi- sweet chocolate chips and doubling the amount of brown sugar and vanilla.  It definitely improves with age and I would recommend making at least one day, if not two days in advance for optimal flavor.",

The saltiness and crunchiness of the pretzels was a good contrast to the richness and creaminess of the dip. It should be said (and has been said before by other reviewers) that the consistency is NOT like that of chocolate chip cookie DOUGH and the flavor is rich and slightly cheescake-y. If you want chocolate chip cookie DOUGH (and not dip) then make a batch of chocolate chip cookie dough and substitute a flaxseed / water mixture for the eggs which would make it safe to eat raw. If you want a lovely dessert DIP to serve with crackers (or pretzels) at a party then serve this.",
