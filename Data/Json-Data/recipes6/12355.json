It was always a ceremony for the kids because I'd put them in the oven just before they went to bed. In the morning the cookies would be \"miraculously\" all done. Use any color of food coloring you desire.",

At the suggestion of a friend I added more cream of tartar and it seemed to help some. In the morning we woke up to 1/4\" thick little blobs of goo that would not come off the greased pan without turning into a gooey mess. I probably won't try this one again which is unfortunate because it seemed so simple and my gluten free daughter would have loved these.",
