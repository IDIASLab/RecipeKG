Just try whatever crosses your mind!  As far as spreading out, I increased the flour to just a little more than 2 1/2 cups.  Also, use stick margarine and NOT the soft spread type as they have way too much oil and water.",

I omitted the nuts in both recipes, and increased the baking time to 11 1/2 minutes (because they were so \"cake like\" that they fell apart).  Perfect adjustment!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!",
