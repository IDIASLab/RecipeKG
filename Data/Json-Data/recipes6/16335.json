Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe Nancy.  Everyone I've shared it with loves it, but I'm running out of pears!!!  Fran",

My mother can't have too much sugar so i used half a cup this time and it tasted great - it made room for the flavor of the pears. I would take out the pie when the custard is just starting to firm as i overcooked mine a bit. But it all depends on what your preference is for the custard - i like mine tender.",

I also added a handful of raisins (that I plumped in hot water) and they added some another layer of flavor and texture. I thought the almond extract was just perfect. Will definitely make again!
