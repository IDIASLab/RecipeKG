The 2nd time I made it I used the cranberries in the bag. As I try to reduce the amount of sugar in my foods I substituted Splenda for the sugar. I also used plain nonfat yogurt (that has no extra sugar added) & then just added a tsp. of vanilla. If you think the dish is too tart you can just add a little more Splenda. I'd suggest stirring it before serving as it gets a little watery. Next time I think I'll double the recipe.",
