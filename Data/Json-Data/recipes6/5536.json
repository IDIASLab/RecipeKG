The tortillas soak up a lot of the moisture, which helps solve the problem people are having about it not setting well. Plus the tortillas become very soft and taste very much like pasta. I didn\u2019t use the salsa, because it was already pretty wet, but I added a packet of GOYA Saz\u00f3n to the mix for flavor. I made my own refried black beans by mashing them and cooking them with garlic, lime and burrito seasoning (the kind from the packet). I also used yellow Spanish rice in the bottom two layers, I didn\u2019t cook the rice all the way so that it could absorb some of the liquid.",

I could not find refried black beans at my supermarket so I bought an extra can of regular black beans and mashed them before preparing that part. I also added chopped jalapenos (from a jar) to the bean mixture since I like my food on the spicy side. I added approximately a quarter cup to begin with but ended up with something more like 1/2 by taste. I ate a leftover piece for lunch and the peppers did not warm up too much overnight. With a 1/2 c. of jalapenos (and medium salsa) I would still categorize the hotness as fairly mild. - that is my old review and I have made this recipe many many times since then. I've tried it with the refried black beans and I really think it works better the way I originally made it (two regular cans one partially mashed). It was a bit too beany with the refried beans. I am known as the vegetarian in my office and I made it for a bunch of meat lovers there recently. No leftovers at all!",

I ate the leftovers today and it was good but it's missing some spice. When I tasted the sauce I thought it was bland so I threw in some basic spices before I even baked it. I think next time I'll add taco seasoning to the ricotta mixture. I added a chedder layer on top and every bite with that is really good. I think it's just a little too bland on its own. I was surprised to read that others had trouble with it being soupie. Mine set perfectly. I made sure my sauce was pretty thick before I assembled it though. Lasagna has gotten pretty old to me and this was a nice twist. Next time it gets more spices though.",
