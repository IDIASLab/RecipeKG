I doubled the brown sugar and honey and instead of putting the almonds into the dough I mixed them with 1/2 cup of brown sugar and about 1 tbls of corn oil and sprinkled it all over the top and sides of the dough before baking it. I added 1 tsp. of pure almond extract to the dough. And I only used 1 tsp. of salt. This was exactly what I was looking for! It was very slightly sweet and crunchy on top and I love the tang from the cream cheese in the bread! I didn't do a second rise. I just let it rise for 1 hour in a greased 8\"x8\" baking dish with my almond/sugar topping then just baked it at 350 degrees for 55-60 minutes! My house was filled with the lovely aroma of sweet almond bread! Perfect! I will be making this ALOT!",

                "reviewBody": "I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. As another poster suggested I doubled the sugar and honey. I thought the dough was too large for one bread pan and it took a long time to rise a little but raised considerably while baking. The loaf tastes good but as with so many wheat breads it is rather dense and a little hard to hold together when toasting. I did like the flavor but I like a bread that is a little more \"spongy\" and less crumbly. Perhaps next time I will divide it between two loaf pans and see if less weight makes it a little less dense.",
