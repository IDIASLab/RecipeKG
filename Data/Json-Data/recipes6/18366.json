This way they weren't sour at all and the coconut taste was great!  I also just used canned crushed pineapple and it worked just fine.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

THen I sprinkled the batter with coconut (can stir in too). I used fresh pineapple... I had some extra so I sauteed it in 1T browned butter and 1T brown sugar...OMG that was amazing on top of these! The butter and sugar mixed perfectly with the juices from the pineapple to create just enough of a syrup. Wow--this was a great recipe! I didn't have any issue with \"sour\" tasting--was your sour cream expired?? Yum! This is a favorite!!",
