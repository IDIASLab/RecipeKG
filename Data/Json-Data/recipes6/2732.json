                "reviewBody": "I simplified a little and tossed all the seasoning directly into the crock pot along with the other crock pot ingredients but other than that followed directions / ingredients (my roast was a tad bigger than the 1 lb called for). It was a little wet at the end even with the cheese mixed in so I let it sit with lid off on high a couple hours and that definitely helped thicken it up. If yours is \"saucy\" before adding the Velveeta it's not a bad idea to drain off some of that excess liquid. This was a very tasty dip that is also incredibly versatile. Makes a great pulled pork sandwich filling makes DELICIOUS BBQ nachos dip with bread rounds tortilla chips or Doritos or add to some Brunswick stew. All really good tasty options!",

                "reviewBody": "I used a pork loin instead of tenderloin for sliders. After it was finished cooking I drained almost all the liquid and let the fat rise to the top then skimmed it off. I shredded the pork and then added more of the pork juice to keep it moist. Then I cubed up the velveeta added it to the crock pot and let it melt. I thought the bbq/smoke flavor and pickle would be weird with the cheese but the cheese just held it together it didn t overwhelm it at all. It had a nice tangy bbq flavor. I m definitely going to have this again. It was a hit at the tailgate party! My only worry is if I can t find the seasoning packet at my grocery store.",
