I made it for a morning Bible study group so I didn't want it too sweet at breakfast time. I doubled the recipe only used Chex and Honey Nut O's for cereal only used peanuts for nuts used half of the brown sugar half the white chocolate chips half the nutmeg and ginger and increased the cinnamon by 50%. My husband and I both thinks it's great. He said it's addicting so I better seal it so I have enough to take Monday.",
