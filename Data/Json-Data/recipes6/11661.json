For instance, are the wafers supposed to be crumbs or just small pieces? Either way, mine floated to the top. Also, my gas oven usually takes less time to cook, so I have to always adjust the cooking times but with this recipe, how do you know if it\u2019s done? When it browns on top? When the fork comes out clean? I had no idea. I used regular cups because I couldn't find the mini ones, and cooked it for 10 minutes, but was unsure if they were done or not so I cooked them another 3 minutes. After they had cooled, they tasted great but the texture was terrible. It was grainy and gel like. I left them in the fridge over night, and it became firmer, but still had the terrible texture. Was this because it wasn't cooked long enough? Over cooked? Or was it because the wafers floated up into the cups and maybe changed the texture? I hate to give this recipe such a poor rating, but the instructions were terrible for someone who has never made cheesecake before. The taste was good though, especially with the \"cheesecake\" flavored cream cheese.",

I made them ans took them to a baby shower one weekend and then because they were so good and so simple to make, doubled the recipe to make even more for a wedding shower the next weekend.  Everyone was calling me \"Martha Stewart\" and was so impressed by the presentation.  Of all the desserts at this shower--this one was gone first with people begging me for the recipe! When I told how simple they were, no one would believe me.  I do have some comments, though that I hope will help...first when you process the vanilla wafers, which is so easy, it makes a lot, so you will have a lot of extra crumbs.  I even used a heaping teaspoon in each, more than double what the recipe calls for.  it made a nice base.  I increased the vanilla a little bit, just because I like the flavor of vanilla, and also you will not need the whole can of topping either.  I used cherry, blueberry and I also macerated some fresh strawberries to top the mini-cheesecakes.  I would suggest to use a ratio of 1+ 1/2 filling to base & topping.  These are so delicious, you will not be left with any extras! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.",
