I used the recommendation of putting in a little bit of granulated sugar to grind up the almonds in a blender so that the ground almonds wouldn't stick together to form a paste.\n\nI also followed the suggestion of using 2.5 teaspoons almond extract & 1.5 teaspoons vanilla extract, giving it a delicious flavor.\n\nI also doubled the glaze amount (doubling the milk, confectioner's sugar, and almond extract, but keeping the same amount of toasted almonds).  The glaze didn't stick to the cake as well, so as I poured the glaze on and it ran off the cake, I scooped the glaze up a few more times and continued to pour it over the cake some more.\n\nI baked it for about 50 minutes and it turned out quite well, but next time I will probably bake it 45 minutes so that it doesn't turn out as dark of a brown.\n\nTo toast the almonds for the glaze, I laid out the almonds on a cookie sheet and baked about 6 minutes at 350 degrees.\n\nGreat recipe - will definitely make again!!",

As I was reading reviews, I noticed that some people had problems getting the cake out of the bundt pan.  When ever I use a bundt pan, I spray Baker's Joy which can be found in the baking section of your local grocer.  It is in a can and it is a no-stick spray with flour which you just spray in the pan.  I have never had a problem with sticking or crumbling.  Hope that helps.  Very mosit.  Thank you for the great recipe Judy!!",

I have a dark bundt pan so that might have been a reason it cooked in less time.  It still was a little dark so 45 minutes seems appropriate.  Good almond flavor, a little crumbly and it's difficult to get it out of the pan so more butter and flour on the bundt pan may be helpful.  The icing is good but I think I'll stick with the confectioner's kind if I make this again.",

I used confectioners sugar in the glaze as granulated would be grainy (unless maybe it would be cooked to dissolve it).  The glaze was very runny though, next time I'll probably start with 1-2 Tbsp milk and then add more if needed.  That would probably make the almonds stick better to the cake, as is they just run down the sides with the glaze.  I might try this with pecans or walnuts too.  Yum!",
