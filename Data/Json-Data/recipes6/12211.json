While this one is a bit different, it's been requested as a 'cookie jar staple' by my husband ever since first tasting them at Christmastime.  A few tips I've stumbled upon while making these:  The recipe doubles easily (triple it and the batter gets stiffer as it sits).  Fill a large pastry bag (or even a large zip-top baggie) with batter to squeeze desired amount onto iron (eliminates the sticky spoon-fingers situation).  The vanilla is interchangeable with other extracts; I've tried almond, black walnut, lemon, orange and rum.  Also, additions of nuts can be sprinkled on the raw batter just prior to baking; I've used sliced almonds with almond extract, pecans with rum extract and walnuts with black walnut extract.  And yesterday I added a few mini chocolate chips to an orange-flavored batter.  Delicious!",

I decided to experiment with this recipe and made dozens upon dozen of pizzelles in the following flavors:  anise, vanilla, orange, and chocolate chocolate chip.  For the anise and vanilla flavors I followed the recipe exactly.  For the orange pizzelles, I used orange flavoring instead of the anise/vanilla and also added some orange zest.  For the chocolate chocolate chip, I followed the recipe for the chocolate pizzelles and added mini chocolate chips.  (I had to add more flour to this batter to get it to cook properly.)  All of the pizzelles were a HUGE hit at the reception and now I have people begging me to make pizzelles for them.  Thanks for the great recipe, Marianne.  I can't wait to experiment with even more flavors.",
