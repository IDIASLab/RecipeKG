A couple of tips about the dough -- let it warm up a little more and it should not be so crumbly. When you cream together the sugar butter and egg yolk it has to be creamy or it will be crumbly (as with any recipe). If it is still too crumbly put a small bowl of milk out while you roll dip your fingers in the milk and roll the balls. That will moisten it a bit. KUDOS on this recipe -- I'm off to make a few hundred more -- while my husband is at work!!",

After reading about other people's trouble with the dough I was apprehensive. But if you really cream the butter and sugar and egg until it becomes light and you add the flour mixture slowly maybe 13 cup at a time waiting until it is integrated the dough comes out much smoother and easier to work with. Thanks for the memories.",

To solve the crumble factor mentioned before I found that chilling the dough for 2 hours was too long and if you just chill it until it forms a ball without sticking to your hand they are very very easy to make and roll in the almonds. The almonds should be chopped fairly finely. I used a blender and finished them off by hand. Really quick to put together when the dough isn't too cold. To fill the thumbprint stir your jam and put into a small baggie. Cut a corner of the baggie off and use as a pastry bag. The cookies are filled in no time! I'm definitely adding this recipe to my Christmas Cookie list.",

I suggest you read reviewers' comments in the past carefully before trying out this recipe especially the tips about how to manage this rather crumbly dough (creaming the dough until fluffy and if necessary dip your fingers in milk while shaping). I had quite a hard time shaping the dough because it was quite dry but the dryness is necessary for the light texture of this cookie. Also make individual cookie size as small as possible and round (do not flatten it) before baking because they loosen flat a bit while baking. I will make them again for this Thanksgiving.",

The dough like others was very dry and crumbly even after whipping the butter well. add 1 TBS milk at a time until you get the right consistancy. (I added 2 TBS of milk) and that did the trick. Dough was not sticky and easy to work with. these cookies are meant to be about \"bite sized\".",

Beat the unused egg white slightly then use to dip the balls of dough prior to rolling in the chopped nuts. This keeps the nuts stuck to the cookie. Press a slight indentation into the top then bake half way before adding the jam and returning to the oven. This keeps the jam a brighter red color but dries the jam just enough for cookies not to stick to each other when storing.",

You gotta make 'em but place cookie dough in refrigerator for 5-10 minutes before placing in oven as they will spread out and make a mess. I used parchment paper for easy cleanup too. As others have suggested I used the bottle cap to my vanilla to make the impressions not my thumb. I accidentally overloaded the thumbprint area but finally got the hang of how much jam to use. Also I used two different jams but the raspberry ones went first. Nothing was left and I only got one cookie!! Next time I'm making a double batch and keeping some for myself.",
