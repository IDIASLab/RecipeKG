Easy enough to fix. The vegetable flakes weren't a necessary addition as they really didn't contribute anything. The peppers mushrooms and onions on the other hand did particularly the peppers. They added wonderful flavor as well as color. I didn't use nearly as much of the peppers as the recipe called for however just threw on enough till it looked right for me. I did use the paprika but that wasn't nearly as important as some seasoning would have been. I also used real butter not the reduced fat spread. While these can be improved upon simply by adding seasoning they still were delicious and looked very festive.",

Needed something to accompany our organic rib eye steaks and the hubby wanted foil packet potatoes. I cubed the russets and used a green bell pepper as that is our preference. Halved the onions and sliced thickly. Used five organic white mushrooms (could use more). Half a teaspoon salt (not enough). Have never heard of vegetable flakes so sprinkled with (spicy) Mrs. Dash on the advice of other reviewers. Used 2 T unsalted butter and 1 T olive oil (to prevent sticking in lieu of cooking spray). Forgot to poke holes and took 40 minutes in the top rack of our gas grill. Hubby was over the moon about these -- I will keep tweaking and report back...",
