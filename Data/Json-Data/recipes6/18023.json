For those who had problems with the streusel topping sinking into the batter and cracking during the baking process, follow the simple step. After preparing the topping, place the entire bowl (not the batter) into the freezer for several hours or overnight. Remix with a fork until they resemble small crumbs. Sprinkle on top of cake batter. Pat down gently with a large spatula (especially the corners) to ensure the topping \"sticks\" to the batter and also to even the cake out. I baked mine at 325 degrees instead of 350 and the cake baked and rose more evenly. Take a look at my photo. The cake was delicious and disappeared very quickly!! Thank you Mary for the recipe!!!",

BEFORE TRYING THIS RECIPE I DID READ ALOT OF THE REVIEWS AND TOOK IN TO ACCOUNT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE SAID, SUCH AS NOT ENOUGH STREUSEL AND THE STREUSEL MELTING INTO THE CAKE.  I REMEDIED BOTH, I USED 1/2 CUP OF FLOUR, 1/2 CUP OF WHITE SUGAR AND 1/2 CUP OF BROWN SUGAR (KEPT THE BUTTER THE SAME) FOR THE STEUSEL, IT MADE MORE THAN ENOUGH, I ALSO DID'NT PUT THE STREUSEL ON UNTIL IT WAS COMPLETELY DONE. I PUT THE STEUSEL ON AND COVERED THE PAN (9X9) WITH ALUMINUM FOIL AND THAT MOISTENED THE STREUSEL I THEN PRESSED IT DOWN JUST A BIT. I ALSO ADDED A BIT OF CINNAMON TO THE FLOUR FOR THE BATTER AND IT ALL TURNED OUT GREAT!!!! THANKS MARY",

I have made this cake several times with no additions or ingredient changes and it was never dry. Try rotating the baking pan at the halfway point of the baking time and then check five minutes before the end of the recommended baking time with a cake tester or toothpick. There should be very few crumbs adhering to the tester when the cake is ready. Hope this helps.\r\n",

It took a few extra minutes to cook and a few minutes for the topping to set.

A recipe's ingredients should be listed in the order in which they will be used - unless there is a caption showing the following ingredients are for the topping.In this case, the topping is listed last but the instructions deal with it first.  The poster notes the 1/4c. flour & the 2/3 c sugar & 1tsp cinnamon but then simply says to cut in the butter.  I can see why one reviewer ended with a puddle of butter on the cake because looking quickly I put in the 1/2 c butter.  Just before turning the mixer on I realized what I had done and was able to remove some in time.    Other than that blip, I followed the recipe, had no problem with using a 9x13 pan.  The cake itself rose to almost 1.75\" and with the topping it was a good 2\".  That's quite good enough for a coffee cake.  I'm finding the topping crumbles a lot when removing to serve but the flavor, moisture, texture is excellent.  Took about 15 minutes longer to cook.",
