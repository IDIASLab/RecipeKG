However, I did make a few modifications to make it more whole grain and wonderfully delicious. I subbed the 1 3/4 cups of flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup oat flour, then cut the 1/2 cup of white sugar to 1/4 cup of white sugar (someone on here thought it was too sweet). I also used only 2.5 cups of rolled oats, as that was all that I had left. Another tip - put your cookie dough in the fridge for 1 hour before you start to bake it and use a small icecream scooper to form the cookies on your cookie sheet. It tasted wonderfully chewy, rich and perfectly sweet. It reminded me of the Double Tree Chocolate Chip cookies they used to give out at their hotel, but better because I used all organic ingredients and absolutely no preservatives. Yummy!",

Here they are: \n\nAdd 1/2 cup more coconut. \nTry using pecans, just a better tasting cookie\nAny flavor chip can be substituted but CHOCOLATE CHUNKS ARE BEST. \n\nTips for a great cookie!\n\nIn a large bowl, cream together the SOFT butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. \nSlowly pour/mix in the beaten eggs , milk and vanilla. \n\nCombine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the sugar mixture until well blended. \nStir in oats then chocolate chips then nuts and finally the coconut until all is distributed.\n\n Drop by rounded balls onto ungreased cookie sheet....See tip below! ***\n Bake 12 to 15 minutes on middle rack of oven for a chewy cookie.... See tip below! ***\n\nCool for 1 minute on the cookie sheet and then remove to wire rack. Cool completely and then store in tightly sealed container.\n\n*** Use ice cream scoop slightly rounded to make 22-24 cookies. Making 22-24 is important......This will insure they will be nice and thick and stay chewy  for days.\n\n*** Keep a second cookie pan cooled in the refrigerator and alternate between batches.\nWhile cooking first batch, roll all of the remaining balls and keep them chilled as well. This will prevent your cookies from spreading out too much & becoming flat and crispy.\n\nBalls can be kept in the fridge for several days to be cooked later.\nRolled balls can also be wrapped in plastic and frozen to be later th",

My only changes: only had 3/4 c butter so I added 1/4 c shortening I also added another cup of coconut and used 1 1/2 c of dark chocolate chips instead of semi sweet. My young boys and I prefer dark over semi-sweet and also added 3/4 tsp of cinnamon. Then I refriderated for 1 hour. These cookies are hard to mix my hand but my beautiful BOSCH mixer with cookie paddles made lite work of it. The dough was a little hard to make \"stick\" together. I rolled 1 1/2 inch dough balls and baked at 350 degrees for 11 min. with the first dozen then 14 min. with the 2nd dozen. My convection oven is right on target with the lower cooking times with most recipes. The first dz was I thought a little undercooked but turned out fine after it cooled completely. The 2nd dz at 14 min. was better though. They made full (not flat) 2 1/2 - 3 inch cookies. They were rich and flavorful. I saved the other half of the dough in the freezer for later. I may actually cut back on the chocolate chips next time only b/c a 12 oz bag was more than enough quantity and richness wise. My sons beg to differ however. Thanks for this great recipe.

I told a co-worker I would make him any cookie he wanted for his birthday and he said \"how about oatmeal butterscotch coconut macadamia nut?\" I made a few alterations that I think worked out well. Since I already had some sweetened flaked coconut to use I decided to cut out the white sugar completely from the ingredients since I'd read some reviews earlier saying the cookies were too sweet. Seemed sweet enough to me since in addition to the coconut I was using a mix of chocolate & butterscotch chips and chopped chocolate-covered macadamia nuts. The only other adjustment I made was to put in a 3/4 cup wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour. This made it a bit heartier of a cookie and hopefully a little healthier. With my first batch 375 seemed to get the cookies a bit darker than I'd hoped (I like them a little crunchy on the outside and chewy inside) so I started baking for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees (2 pans at a time switching racks @ 10 minutes) and was happier with the results. Awesome!",

Perhaps they should be cooked at 350?  also disappointingly you couldn't really taste the coconut.  Someone else mentioned using coconut extract and that's probably a good idea.  Otherwise these were a run of the mill fancy chocolate chip cookie.",
