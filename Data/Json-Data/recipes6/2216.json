A great balance of the sweet and spices, with a smooth texture.\n\nA note, to cook the squash, I put it in the microwave for about 3-4 mins so it was easier to cut in half. I removed the seeds, then put on a baking sheet with some foil over it, then baked in the oven on 350 for about 40 mins; then I let it cool before scooping out with my measuring cup. \nSo with that in mind, I would add about an hour to the prep time if you are using fresh butternut squash.",

Also I have never added vanilla extract to these types of pies and it really seems to enhance all of the other ingredients. Thank you Blaze and your grandmother up north.",
