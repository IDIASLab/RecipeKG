I added a tablespoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of nutmeg and cinnamon to make it more flavorful. I iced it with an orange powdered sugar glaze at the end (3 tablespoons of oj 1.5 cups of powdered sugar). The dough was not for cutting so I made these as drop cookies and they formed beautifully. Also I ended up with a lot more cookies than the recipe called for...so plan on making some for others as well! Everyone will thank you for it!",
