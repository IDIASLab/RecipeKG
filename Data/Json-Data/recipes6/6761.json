The reason being is that the shrimp takes a lot less time to cook than the other ingredients. On the first step you are partially cooking the sausage, potatoes, onion, and corn. You'll set the timer for 1 minute however it takes 20 minutes for the IP to come to pressure and those ingredients are \"cooking\" those 20 minutes it takes to come to pressure. You then stir in the shrimp and set time for 0 minutes. It will take the IP 10 minutes to come to pressure again and then your timer set for 0 minutes will go off as soon as it comes to pressure. See, the shrimp gets \"cooked\" in the 10 minutes it took the IP to come to pressure.  I hope this helps with your questions.",
