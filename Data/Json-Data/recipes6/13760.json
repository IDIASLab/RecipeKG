The reviewers who say it is bland intrigue me, what do you think vanilla pudding is going to taste like? If you want a stronger taste use a different essence, I have made them with almond essence and toasted almonds and also tried mixing 2-1/2 tsp of coffee with 1-1/2tsp of water in place of essence and they have all come out beautifully.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe it is a definite favourite.",
