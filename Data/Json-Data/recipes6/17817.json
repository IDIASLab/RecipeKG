It is a little more fudgey than cakey - but totally awesome (besides what can you expect when you omit the flour). \nThree suggestions...\n1. Apply very little pressure when pressing down with the fork (really just enough to leave the fork lines). \n2. When making the divet (sp?) for the jam, make it really shallow!  Don't worry, the jam will cling very happily to the \"fork lines\" you already made. \n3. Before adding the jam do the following (to the jam) - put a couple of large spoonfuls of the jam in a separeate bowl and stir the heck out of it.  You will end up with jam that is sort of syrupy and very easy to dollop onto cookies.\n\nBy doing these things my cookies did not break apart, the jam did not drip through and I was able to add quite a liberal amout of jam.",

And adding jelly is too hard and tedious, just make these peanut butter cookies or add 1 cup of chocolat or butterscotch chips.  If you do, reduce sugar to 2/3 cup per batch.  I now just make these w/o jelly, add chips and use a fork to make an imprint.  I made them for my kids, (4 & 1 yrs. old) and they loved them, hubby too and disappeared at the bake sale.  And made them for a women's tea.  They're small and perfect for a lady's finger.  Too easy not to try them!",

When I made them I doubled the recipe and used Splenda (sugar substitute) in place of half of the sugar which worked out fine and cut the calories significantly. (You may even be able to substitute Splenda for all the sugar in the recipe; I just haven't tried it yet.) I wanted bite-sized cookies so I used a small melon baller (1 teaspoon) flattened them very slightly with a fork and as suggested by another reviewer used the back of a 1/8 teaspoon measure to make the indent for the jelly. As others have said do not overbake these; 8 minutes and 30 seconds was perfect for this size of cookie. Hope you will enjoy them too!",

Some things I suggest are: Only use about half a cup of sugar..It's VERY sweet! And do not over cook. They may seem very mushy when it's 10 minutes but they are done. Let them sit for a while and they'll firm up. Also they expand so don't flatten them out too much. Last suggestion is DOUBLE THE RECIPE!! They only made 9 medium sized cookies. Eat with a glass of milk and enjoy! Will definatley make these again =)",
