I added approximately one cup of mashed sweet potato (that I had microwaved the day before) and about 1 cup of shredded zucchini. When the ingredients were all mixed together the batter was far too thin as compared to other muffins I've made before. I added about 1/4 cup of old fashioned oats to try to soak up some of the liquid. I ended up with 12 muffins which stuck to the liners and a small mini loaf. The texture of the final product is very spongy. They are very sweet. I hope that my husband's coworkers who will eat anything will eat these. Sorry I won't make these again.",
