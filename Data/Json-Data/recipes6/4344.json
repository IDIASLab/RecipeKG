First reduce the olive oil to 2 Tbsp instead of 3 (you don't need so much oil in such a small serving). Thought it was much too thick so added more like 1.5 cups of broth. For most flavorful gravy use an \"unchicken\" broth instead of plain vegetable broth. I think Westbrae \"California UnChicken Broth\" has the best flavor. Finally suggest using meatless sausage patties instead of links -- I think the Morningstar brand is the most tasty. Defrost two patties finely chop and add to gravy right before serving. I whipped up a batch of gravy and served it for breakfast over biscuits. YUM.",
