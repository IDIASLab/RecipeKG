                "reviewBody": "I'm a huge rhubarb fan and this \"tonic\" was excellent. Perfectly sweetened as a mixer for drinks. I loved it mixed with seltzer water - 1 part tonic, 3 parts seltzer over ice. Very refreshing on a hot day. This would also make excellent cocktails. The issue I had was the cooking method.  The fact that you don't stir the mixture caused the bottom pieces of rhubarb to overcook and the top pieces to be underdone. It would be so much easier just to simmer everything directly in a saucepan and skip the bowl idea, like most other similar recipes I've made. This ended up making 6oz of tonic.",
