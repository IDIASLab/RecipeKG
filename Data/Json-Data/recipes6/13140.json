I had the heat on low and I was able to get most of the egg stirred into the sugar/butter/date mixture quickly. But if any egg touched the skillet anywhere prior to incorporating into the mixture = scrambled eggs. Fortunately I was able to salvage most of it but I think it's a must to put some of the hot mixture into the egg first and mix it prior to adding the eggs to the skillet. I'll try that next time. The cookies that survived are delicious. A great way to use fresh dates. (UPDATED to give this 4 instead of 3 stars. I do make these every year. I always stir some of the hot mixture into the egg now and avoid touching the egg mixture to the side of the skillet until it has been incorporated into the date mixture. These are chewy and delicious.)",
