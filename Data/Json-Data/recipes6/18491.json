The minute I tasted the preserves I went back in time. I followed your recipe I did have to cook a little longer. I sent some to my sisters and they had the same reaction. These are going to my Mom as a gift for Mother's Day and her birthday, along with some other baked goods, which will include bread to put these delicious preserves on. These will make her day, it sure did mine. I will keep this recipe to make every year. Thank you. ",

These are actually what are also more often  called 'Watermelon Pickles'. They are usually used as a type of condiment, and eaten just like a 'regular pickle'. They are more similar to a sweet type of pickle that you would either snack on, or eat along side of other kinds of foods, than they are a preserve that you would traditionally use to spread onto some type of bread. Also, they have more of a sweet & sour, or tangy & spicy kind of flavor than they do a fruity type of flavor normally associated with a 'preserve'. As such, in order to be fair to the recipe, please try to keep all of that in mind when leaving your reviews. Here are some other helpful hints & tips that I hope you can find to be useful; Some of the other names that this recipe is usually called are Watermelon Candy, Watermelon Pickles, and/or Pickled Watermelon. Also, if you'd like your Watermelon Pickles to have a bit more crunch to them, soak them in Alum rather than salted water. It's also better to slice them into 2\" long strips/chunks if you'll be eating them like a 'regular' pickle. Hopefully this will help to erase some of the confusion out there that has been caused due to the recipe's name. Try this recipe if you haven't done so yet, and you WILL be pleasently suprised!",

I didn't use a scale for my preserves (I just eyeballed it) and came up with 3 pints of preserves. The hardest part is just cutting up the rind. There was a lot of left over syrup which is technically just \"simple syrup\" so you could re-use it for any recipe that calls for that (like ice cream). This was fun and different thanks!",
