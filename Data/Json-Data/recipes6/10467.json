It was then baked, and each biscuit sliced in half to receive a paper-thin slice of incredible salt cured ham. Today, you could use the food processor or a biscuit brake (usually nothing more than a converted washing wringer) to make the dough \"snap.\"",

Also water was never in them and it was butter not lard. I have at least 5 old Kentucky recipe books and the ingredients are identical in each one of them one going back to 1908! Just find one that has only flour sugar butter salt and enough milk to hold them together. By the way I make my old Kentucky version every week with a food processor and it takes 5 minutes and they turn out flawlessly at 350 degrees for 30 minutes of baking time. They are softer than Carr's Water biscuits but are not a baking powder biscuit.",

I think his comment was \"Just make regular biscuits!\" as I was beating the tar out of these. Thanks for letting me try something different.
