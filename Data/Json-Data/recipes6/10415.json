I didn't have canned biscuits so I used 2 packages of \"bisquick complete cinnamon swirl\" biscuits and made a 1/2 recipe in a 8X8 square pan. cooking time was closer to 45-50 mins and I used raisins instead of blueberries. Also I just dumped the extra couple of Tbsp sugar/cinnamon mixture from rolling the dough in into the syrup so it is thicker & less gooey. One thing I need to stress is that you should invert this over a cake plate immediately! If you wait for it to cool it won't want to come out due to the syrup hardening. This would be amazing with chopped walnuts as well. I would layer them under the dough so that when the syrup goes through to the bottom and you invert it therewould be a caramely walnutty topping. YUmmy!",

I only used half of the sauce (other reviewers said there was too much sauce) but due to the overnight refrigeration I could have used more. It wasn't as gooey as others described when I baked it but more moist with blueberry sauce. Was great and can be modified to fit almost any taste. Could also use frozen rolls and compile it the night before - just stick it in a cold oven overnight and turn the oven on when you get up!",
