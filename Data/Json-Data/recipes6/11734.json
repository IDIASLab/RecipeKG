Not exactly an elegant cookie, but not ugly - just make your teaspoons of dough a little bit \"rounded\" and they should be ok.  However, I only cooked them for 8-10 minutes -- not the 20-23 minutes called for.  Whoa!  I would've been calling the fire dept. by then!!  DO watch for brown edges on the cookies, and then take them out right away - they will remain nice and soft, even after cooling.  I also made sure to use butter, as I had some fairly disappointing results with another cookie recipe recently when I substituted margarine for butter.  These are wonderful cookies to share!!",
