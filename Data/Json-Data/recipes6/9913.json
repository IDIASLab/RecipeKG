I love hot and spicy food but left out the chili and pepper flakes so that my two year old could eat it. I pressed froze and pressed again the tofu making it way less mushy and more resilient to work with. After cubing it I sprinkled soy sauce and mirin over it to soak in the flavors and let it sit for about 15 minutes before frying it in sesame oil with a dash of toasted sesame oil for more flavor. I added the vegetables including bean sprouts after the tofu was brown on all sides cooked for the required length of time then added the liquid to which I added a little more brown sugar and mirin. We ate it over rice but my son had his over bean thread. This was soooo good and even better the next day. Will definately be making it again. Thanks for sharing.",

I love how it comes out consistently good every time I make it despite my alterations. Careful with those red pepper flakes because if you go overboard you will ruin the dish. I recommend add only 25% of what the recipe calls for and then add little more at the very end while you stir and taste the finished product. Make sure that you press the tofu for 1 hour before you begin. Look up \"pressed tofu\" on the internet if you dont understand what this means.",

But I found this recipe to be delightful, and probably ate three out of the four servings myself!

Instead of just browning we slightly deep fried it so that it was nice and crispy on the outside - not as healthy but the texture is so much better! We also added about 1 tbs. of honey to the sauce to give it a bit more sweetness and a handful of 'frying mushrooms' (my store carries this prepacked variety of shrooms best for frying but shiitakes would work as well).
