It kind of looks like melted butter, but has a taste like a not overly sweet butterscotch. I made 1/2 recipe, because I didn't need a full cup of syrup. I also lowered the sat. fat a bit, and it didn't seem to affect the recipe. For half the recipe I used 2 Tblsp. of butter and the rest a light margarine and used 1% milk instead of evaporated to avoid wasting a full can for the small amount. I have found that syrups tend to turn to a caramel on med-high, so I cooked it on medium or 5 on my stove. According to the introduction, it is meant for cakes, but it was fine warm on pancake puffs (ebelskivers).",
