I bought two pre-made chocolate crumb pie shells to use as the crust. I buttered the sides and the bottom of the springform pan before pressing the crumbs/butter mixture in the pan. I used two premade crusts in order to have my crust go up the sides of the cheesecake. All my cheesecake ingredients were at room temp. I researched (on this site) how to bake it in a water bath...check the article by Jennifer Anderson. I so hoped it would not have a crack when it was baked but there was one (just one) and so I used a hot wet knife to rub on top until the crack was gone. I kept the cake wrapped in the fridge for two days. On the day of the prom I took it out of the springform pan and prior to serving it I sprinkled oreo crumbs on top and placed oreos (cut in half) around the edges. I cannot tell you how wonderful this looked and tasted. It's not easy to totally wow teenagers but this did the trick. Thank you Kristy!",

Compared to that this was bland. But still good. I doubled the crust recipe because I like mine halfway up the side of the cake. I also clarified the butter. I did the pan of water in the oven as suggested but still developed a massive canyon of a crack in the cake - I am sure my fault and not that of the recipe. So I took one user's advice and made a chocolate sauce to pour into the crack. I used mini chocolate chips sugar milk and corn syrup. Also 55 minutes baking time was too long for my oven the cake turned an unattractive brown color around the edges and top. And if you forget to put the mini chips in and accidently pour the batter into the crust never fear. You can still gently mix them in just be careful not to disturb the crust. On the flavor issue it was a very good tasting cake. If you want flavor you have to make a flavored cake ie)peanut butter or chocolate. This is a very good basic cheesecake.",
