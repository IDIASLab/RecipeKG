My Grandma always called it \"Poor Man's Rice Pudding\" because of the small amount of rice used. I remember her telling me that her Grandmother had made it for her when she was a little girl! This is the original comfort food in my opinion! The only thing Grandma did different(from what I remember) was to add about 1t. each of vanilla and cinnamon to the recipe. Again thanks so much for the great memories and giving me the chance to share this with my kids!2/01/08 I have to add some add'l comments to my original review after seeing the bad reviews this recipe is receiving. As the submitter states you have to stir this pudding every 15 minutes during the first hour so that the rice gets distributed evenly. Also this pudding takes a long time to cook. Two hours is the time I usually end up baking it. Finally the pudding usually ends up with a brown \"skin\" across at least part of the top after baking. This is o.k. it's supposed to be there. My sisters and I used to fight over this part! I guess it just depends on what you were brought up with. To me the thick stove-top type of rice pudding just doesn't taste good at all. This recipe on the other hand is sublime:)",
