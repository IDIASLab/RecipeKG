If you can't find the herb & garlic dry soup, vegetable works just fine.  I only used a little corn - don't listen to other reviews - some corn in vegetable lasagne tastes great.  I had enough left over to make a little 8x8 for the freezer.  Use the no boil lasagne noodles (Barilla) and you cut your preparation time in half!  Thanks for a great make again recipe!!",

I've never tried a lasagna recipe that didn't include a tomato-based sauce but this was awesome. I didn't have corn on hand and wasn't really wanting corn in it so I substituted some sliced zucchini that I had. I also used plain nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream. I couldn't find the soup mix at the grocery store so minced a garlic and added a sprinkling of herbs. Wow it turned out wonderful. I think the only thing I'd do differently is maybe stirfry or preboil the carrots. Despite the cooking time they came out a bit crunchy. One tip is to definitely completely thaw the broccoli and then drain it very well. I pressed it several times. If you don't you'll probably end up with veggie lasagna soup like someone else did. This was terrific. A definite keeper!",
