                "reviewBody": "I thought these were absolutely delicious. I love the combination of orange and cranberry and this cookie definitely delivered when it came to flavor. I didn't feel like taking a trip to the store to purchase a bottle of orange liquor just to use a couple TBS. I was very generous with the zest. As a matter of fact I used the zest of 2 large navel oranges a heaping tablespoon of frozen orange juice concentrate and subbed orange flavored Craisins. I was afraid that these wouldn't have that 'orange zing' as someone mentioned they were a little bland. These turned out to be far from bland! It wasn't orange overkill either!Delicious! I loved that surprise HINT of cinnamon in the background. I too melted some semisweet chocolate to drizzle on the tops for a finishing touch (spooned it into a ziploc bag seal and snipped a very small hole in one of the bottom corners). These are the most crumbly biscotti I have made so be sure to use a serrated knife and carefully use slow strokes to cut through the log. It's also helpful to take the time to chop the cranberries into smaller pieces to make the logs easier to slice without breaking. A quick pulse of a food processor or some kitchen shears to snip them into smaller pieces did the trick for me. I didn't want to fuss with a knife. The dough will be quite sticky and tricky to shape into logs but it is much easier if you do it with wet hands. These were an unexpected hit with my family but NOT the kids LOL",
