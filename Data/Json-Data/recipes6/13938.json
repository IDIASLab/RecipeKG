Even though I used 1/3 C onion it came out super thick and didn't look very appetizing. Next time I think I will just run the cranberries through the processor and then wisk the rest of the ingredients by hand. The salad on the other hand was fabulous! I coated the walnuts in a cinnamon sugar glaze (approx. 1/4 sugar 1/4 tsp cinnamon 1 T water) and then toasted them. This really created depth to the walnuts. I'm usually not a fan of walnuts but I couldn't stop munching on these! I also threw in a handful of dried cranberries and topped with feta.",

The only thing I changed is that rather than puree the cranberries I actually simmer them for 10 minutes in the vinegar with the sugar and mustard strained it and let it cool. I then hand-mixed it with a wisk rather than blend it. Past experience with blending dressings left them too frothy for my liking. Excellent recipe!",
