However, I\u2019m not quite sure where you get 20 mushrooms large enough to handle 16oz of cream cheese. I used what I consider an appropriate appetizer size mushroom (2\u201d in diameter) and I made over 50 and still had some cheese mixture left over. In the future, I will use this amount of ingredients for 60 mushrooms which I consider 20 servings @ 3 each per serving.  For a smaller crowd, cut the ingredients in half.  Per other reviewers, I placed a large rack on the baking sheet to elevate the mushrooms and keep them separated from the bacon grease and water that\u2019s released from the mushrooms.",

Give a hint to all that think the filling is too much clean the mushrooms of the inside membranes of the mushrooms. The membranes can make the mushrooms soggy when they are being baked. I also cook the bacon brown but still pliable before I place the mushrooms in the oven. If you place the mushrooms in a cold oven and let everything warm up at the same time the shrooms cook more evenly.",

I found that one 8 oz, pkg of cream cheese will stuff 6 cartons of mushrooms if you do the following.  Cut up one bundle of green onions like chives and add to cream cheese.  Chop up half the mushroom stems (3 cartons worth) and add to cream cheese.  Finely chop 4 de-seeded and de-veined fresh jalapeno peppers and add to cream cheese.  Add garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper to cream cheese to taste.  I also used the thin bacon and found that while wrapping around the mushroom, overlay the bacon slightly over cream cheese to keep cream cheese in the mushroom.  This has been a great hit for party gatherings.  Thanks!!!!",
