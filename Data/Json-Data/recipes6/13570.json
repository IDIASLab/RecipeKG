I baked the cookie on a pizza stone until it was golden brown all over (about 20 minutes).  I topped it with the icing and cooled in the fridge until 2 hours before the party.  I then topped with fruit and the orange drizzle and cooled for an additional 2 hours.  Next time, I would make this the night before and cool it in the fridge, as it was much better the next day.  The cookie got very moist and the flavors blended well.  I would also use more strawberries and other \"firm\" fruit such as grapes, blue berries etc.. and stay away from things such as bananas and canned oranges.  Great recipe.....thanks!",

I made this for a pot luck breakfast and followed all directions.  It turned out great.  I even made it the night ahead and refrigerated all night.  No soggy crust!  Don't skip the glaze, though.  It makes this pizza stand out from all others.  I may double it next time, because I didn't have enought to cover the entire pizza.  The taste makes the long preparation time definately worth it!  Update:  I made this a 2nd time in a 9x13 baking dish.  It turned out just the same and was very easy to store in the fridge.",

I simply melt some apple jelly in the microwave and after cooling it a bit, I brush it on the fruit. It makes all the fruit shiny and pretty. Update: After making this for years now, I have a couple of new hints. When I take this to a special BBQ or Party, and I want it to look perfect, I wash and prepare the fruit the night before. After washing the fruit I let it drain and dry overnight on paper towel lined cookies sheets, covering of course. I also bake the cookie base on a disposable foil pizza pan the night before, cover and store it at room temperature. Early the next morning I make the cream cheese layer, spread it on the cookie. I use a pizza cutter or sharp knife and cut it into wedges. I then add the fruit, brush with the melted jelly and carry it in a pizza box to the party. It never fails to impress and everyone loves it. Thanks Kay for the great recipe!",

I used the mixture of 8 oz cream cheese and 7 oz jar of marshmallow cream as others did. The glaze not only adds flavor it gives it the finishing touch that you would expect if you purchased this from a gourmet shop. I baked the dough about 15 minutes and will increase that the next time. The crust softens up once the cream and fruit sit on it for a while - so I think it might be better to over bake it a little. I love this dessert and so does my office!",

I made the whole thing fruit included and froze it overnight. It kept very well and started defrosting on my way to a function. It also kept longer sitting out since it started out so cold. I'm sure with the glaze is great too but I just haven't needed it. Without the glaze the sweetness is just right if you don't like things really sweet. The sugar cookie balances out the cream cheese/cool whip mixture. This is a great recipe if you're sick of making salads to bring to bbq's...it really makes a great impression. I usually use blueberries strawberries and kiwi. I have also used pineapple on occasion. Just be careful...it's addicting!",

Wasn't too crazy about the orange sauce, you can just use orange juice concentrate instead - plus its easier.
