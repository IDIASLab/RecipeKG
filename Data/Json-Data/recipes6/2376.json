It's a little time-consuming but it's so worth it. I cut the cauliflower into florets and was easily able to \"rice\" it in my Ninja blender pitcher in a matter of seconds. Super easy! Next time I'll definitely use much more red pepper flakes and poblano because this wasn't spicy at all for my tastes. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!",

The only changes I made were to use honey instead of brown sugar (out of it) in the sauce, and I subbed in kale and peas for the veggies (what I had on hand in the freezer). I also saut\u00e9ed some shrimp marinated in a bit of granulated garlic, salt, & paprika and cooked very quickly in olive oil & mixed in the shrimp at the end. Outstanding dish! Thanks for sharing!
