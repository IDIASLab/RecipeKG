I found that both pizzas had too much dough for our tastes. I will make it again, but make two pizzas with one recipe of the dough, and I believe that we will STILL have deep dish pizzas. The taste is good; I love the texture that the cast iron brings to the crust. Good recipe...you just have to love a tremendous amount of crust/dough in order for this recipe to be exactly for you! Ours turned out way thicker than the picture shown. I will try to upload the picture of our first pizza. Thx for the recipe!",

I also subbed one cup of whole wheat flour for one cup of A/P flour because we like a whole wheat type of crust. One pizza was a meat lovers pizza with Italian sausage, ham and pepperoni and the other was a supreme type pizza with meats,green pepper, red onion and mushrooms. I also like extra cheese so I doubled that.\nCooked both at 430 degrees for 25 minutes and they were done. Brushed both crusts with the butter and garlic powder mixture.\nExcellent!!!
