Also, I'm not one to have celery seed on hand, so instead I use 1/4 tsp. celery salt and omit the 1/2 tsp of regular salt.  Very tasty.  I prefer homemade dressing to store bought as then I know what is in it AND what is not and.... if you have all the ingredients on hand anyway, why not take 3 minutes to make your own? Thanks for sharing this recipe with us. :) *shred your own fresh cabbage  and add a little grated carrot, if you have it on-hand, for a really fresh slaw and save some money too*",

I had a bit of trouble with the measurements though because the bag of shredded cabbage I had was only 10 oz., so I tried to err on the side of not adding enough (and if I felt like it needed something I could definitely add it later).  Some people complained that it was too creamy, I actually added a bit more mayo than called for.   However I only used half as much vinegar as called for and I'm glad - it was plenty tangy with only half the vinegar.  To account for personal taste, I would suggest starting with 1/2 the mayo and half the vinegar...let it sit in the fridge for an hour or so, then test it out.  You can easily add more mayo to make it creamier or another tbsp of vinegar to twang it up a bit later.",
