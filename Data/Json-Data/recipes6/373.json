The gist of it is grated apples, oats and enough milk or yogurt to let it become softened, if you want it less mushy, add less milk, then add in whatever fruit and whatever sweetener you want (I use stevia).",

Well, I decided to try this anyhow, with the milk and yogurt added and let it sit. That idea, just did not work. It was like oatmeal mush. The texture is just so off, being creamy and mushy. The appearance at first glance looks like tuna salad with apples and raisins. Maybe, more directions were needed here. It is possible that the milk and yogurt were supposed to be added as cereal or a parfait, and there is a misprint. It sounded good and both healthy anyway. It was unfortunately, unsalvageable though.",

The fruit fared well in the fridge overnight and was delicious in the morning! I substituted almond milk/yogurt. I first discovered this on a buffet at a hotel and fell in love instantly. Never thought I could just make it. Thanks for the recipe. Making it outright I would probably only add honey if any sweetner at all...and some cinnamon. The granola had all that already.
