I have never cooked a better chili recipe - not even when experimenting with chocolate or beer. Spicy and very flavorful. Adding beans lends good texture and good nutrition without changing the flavor. PS - The best way to make it is to marinate the meat overnight for at least 12 hours then saute the meat in the morning. Word to the wise - use 2 saute pans simultaneously to cut down on the time you are standing over the stove. Put all the ingredients into a crock pot and simmer all day in on low.",

Cooked for 6 hours and the meat was so tender it just fell apart so it was almost shredded. Made alot so I gave some away to family and friends who are raving about it! Thanks for a great recipe.",
