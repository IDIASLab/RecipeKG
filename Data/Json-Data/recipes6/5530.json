I used 3/4 c. barley and prepared it as directed on the box. The rest of it I did just as the recipe says but at the end I thought it needed a little something so I added about 1 teaspoon of Lawry's Season Salt. It seemed to bring out the other flavors even more. I made this for a family picnic and everyone seemed to like it. The lemon gives it a nice tangy flavor perfect for a hot day.",

I'm giving it 3 stars but it could get to 4 with a little tweaking. I followed the recipe pretty closely though I was a little loose and sloppy with measurements. I felt the thyme was a little overly present and the onions could have been rather more present. The lemon juice / olive oil dressing is mild but nicely balanced but in general I felt like I was just wanting a little more of something and the sweetness of the barley was a little pushy. Possibly a little garlic? Or replace the green onions with shallots? Or leeks? I'm also thinking a little bit of a tart crumbly cheese -- like a feta or sour goat cheese or something in that world -- might be a nice addition. If you haven't cooked with barley before -- I'd only done so once -- be aware that barley is a VERY sweet grain even sweeter than wheat. So feel free to use strongly flavored savory elements with it to balance out the sweetness.",
