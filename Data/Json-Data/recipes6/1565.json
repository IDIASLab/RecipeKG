I thought the recipe called for garbanzos, so that's what I had and used when I finally made it yesterday.  Didn't have raw cashews so I reached for our bag of raw sunflower seeds as per the other reviewers suggestion...and then I saw a bag of Coconut Cashews from Trader Joe's.  Of course, I had to use those!  The extra sweetness and flavor from the Coconut Cashews allowed me to skip the brown sugar. I lightly pulsed the chocolate chips into the mixture at the very end.  I knew if I put them on top, the kids would just pick them off.  Lastly, I skipped the additional milk, leaving the consistency more like fudge (easy to roll into a ball for a truffle-like treat).  I didn't see us eating this with fruit as a dip, and, while it would be awesome as a graham cracker dip or spread, in my opinion the concoction itself is healthier than eating the pile of graham crackers we'd end up dipping.",
