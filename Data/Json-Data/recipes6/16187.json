I used a little less sugar than called for and the sweetness was very good. I also added a little lemon extract in addition to the vanillia to bring out the flavor of the berries. I must not have cooked it quite long enough since the custard came out a bit runny for a pie. I will try it again and cook until a bit more solid. Thanks.",
