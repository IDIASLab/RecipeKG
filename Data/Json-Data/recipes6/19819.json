A very traditional way to eat the leftover dumplings the next day for breakfast or brunch is to chop them up into cubes, pan fry in a little butter; then add eggs and milk, and cook as if you are making scrambled eggs. It's great.",

She always made hers with caraway seeds chopped onions and brown sugar so that's what I did. Made a pork roast in the slow cooker with the zeli and I had a childhood dinner I begged for! I don't have a dumpling slicer (but my grandmother is giving me hers) so I used thread to slice them. The leftover dumplings were cubed and I made another childhood favourite....egg dumplings.

My mom would never take the time to give me the recipe. Once I found this recipe I was in HEAVEN. In my opinion I have perfected this recipe and I can make my dumplings in less than one hour. As far as this recipe goes I use everything up to the breadcrumbs. As for the milk I keep that to a minimum as well as the breadcrumbs. I do stir all of the ingredients as directed however; I use judgment with the milk as to not make it too moist of a batter. The breadcrumbs are added last. I have found that too many breadcrumbs create air pockets for water to enter when boiling. Once my dough is mixed I will use \"Wondra Gravy Flour\" to roll them to their desired shape. Almost as though you would flour a cutting board for bread dough. (I just use the Wondra flour.) The dough yields enough to make two good size rolls about what a muffin size would be. I then boil my water to a strong rolling boil. Drop in my dumplings and then boil for approximately 20 min. constantly rolling and turning.",

Both of my grandmothers and my own mother passed away before I became interested in cooking and I have always regretted not learning this traditional meal. Thank you Sonya for the detailed instructions (it brought back so many memories). Unfortunately my dumplings were not quite as light and fluffy as Babicka's (grandmother's) but this does take some practice. I'm sure it had nothing to do with the recipe and instructions. I may have over-kneaded and possibly cooked them just a little too long but they were still very delicious. I would like to add one valuable tip I found on another site (however the instructions and ingredients on that site left alot to be desired)...rather than cutting with a knife which can compress the dumplings use a long piece of dental floss to cut them into slices for serving. It leaves them virtually in their true form and allows the steam to escape so that they don't turn out too hard. This is the only advice I can offer. Sonya dekuji mockrat (many thanks) for this recipe!!",

I had Czech hruba and polohruba flours at home so I have used these. i only had 2 cups of hruba so used 2 of that and 1 cup of polohruba. I did not have any baking powder at home so i have used an extra tsp of baking soda instead and this worked fine. I have only used 2 eggs which was enough. I have used less bread (only one bread slice cubed (toasted it on the lightest setting and left if air dry for a while whilst cooking other things and kneading the dough). I did not bother beating the eggs beforehand just popped them in. I used smaller amount of milk first about a cup then got stuck in with my hands did not bother with a spoon. I added a little more milk as i worked it just enough for it not to be too dry but not too much so that it holds firm shape. I followed the advices of 200 strokes but instead knead it 200x times by hand until the dough was elastic (sprung back when depressed) and did not stick to my hands anymore. Then I wored the bread cubes in and decided to divide the dough into 2 knedliky which was a good decision as it fit in the pot better. Bear in mind the knedlik will rise as it cooks to 1.5-2 times its raw size. I did not bother cooking it in a cloth just popped them in salty boiling water. I took them out after 20 mintutes cutting them in half with a thread and found the center still raw so popped them in for another 10 minutes",
