My instructions say to sift the flour and baking powder....add up to 3/4 c. water to thin, if necessary....batter should be thick, but fluid enough that it will ribbon off a spatula and hold it's shape...bake until steam subsides but doesn't stop.  Another instruction is to cool on paper towels...can put in a 200 degree oven to crisp further.....if using anise extract, use a 1 oz. bottle.  Oh, and the ingredients say - 2 T. Anisette or 1-1/2 t. Anise oil.  I use the oil and often add some anise seeds to it.  Always get compliments on my pizzelles!!  (and I'm Irish! LOL) This recipe will make about 100 cookies.",

I have an electric iron that makes 4 at a time so to make it easy on my self I put the dough in a pastry bag and then just squeezed out the right amount this makes it very simple and controls the amount that you use to make even cookies. Each iron is different and you need to adjust the time and the color you want after a few days of curing the cookies I now know that for my iron what color means done and for me it is a very light color because my iron makes them so thin.",
