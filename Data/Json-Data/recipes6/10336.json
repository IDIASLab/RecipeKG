I love how moist it is without tasting like oil, like some zucchini breads do.  I forgot to swirl it but the 2 layers looks pretty too.  This is going into the family favorite folder right now!  Oh, for 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice use:  1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp allspice and 1/8 tsp nutmeg.",

We are trying to cut down on fat, so I used the equivalent amount of applesauce in place of the shortening and it turned out beautifully.  I didn't feel as guilty about the chocolate chips then!  I love the layered look.  I also sifted the cocoa powder in to the batter to avoid clumps.  This will be a repeat recipe in our house. Love this recipe and have shared it with family and friends.

Although, next time i think i will use 2T. cocoa powder instead of 3T. because it is very chocolatey with the addition of chocolate chips.  I made one loaf of this recipe last night in addition to two loaves of my own recipe.  Everyone absolutely loved every last bit of them.  For a variation, try adding 1/2 c. shredded coconut plus 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. almond extract to the batter and you will be in for a delicious suprise.  I do this with my other recipes sometimes.",

I will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe!!!",
