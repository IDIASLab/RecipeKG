I didn't think it was too bitter but it definitely has a \"dark chocolate\" flavor to it more so than hot fudge for ice cream. It's also very gooey sticky making it quite difficult to cut your cake. I put the whole recipe on an 8x8 cake and it probably would have been enough for a 9x13. I probably won't make this again.",
