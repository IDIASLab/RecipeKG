Before making flan I would advise reading the how-to on the mexican recipes main page. It had many tips like don't stir the sugar and to add a drop or two of lemon juice to it. Also it had more detailed instructions on how to make a proper water bath for the flan. One woman who lived in peru for 10 years said that she usually flips her flan over right after it cools then she chills it like that. That way a lot less of the caramel sticks to the pan. These tips made for a nice flan which was also moderately easy to prepare.",

One hint for those who have a problem with it (such as the person who found it crumbly) -- switch the steps in the recipe. First caramelize the sugar and pour into the pan then allow it to cool -- that way the eggs will not curdle upon being poured into the pan.",

I just didn't know how to get the crunchy glaze out of the pan.  I guess hot water would release it. I also wasn't sure whether to cover it or not, I didn't cover it. My husband took it to work to true Mexicans.  I shouldn't have been nervous about it, they loved it. I will make it over and over again. Fabulous!!!!!!",
