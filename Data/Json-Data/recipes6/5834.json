The flavor was very mild so if you aren't going to add hot sauce you may need to add more spices.  In my opinion, if your chicken has been cooking long enough you don't have to remove it to shred it.  It comes apart nicely by just stirring it.  Ours was much more \"soupy\" than the photo. It was like a chicken chili.   I added sour cream and cheese and served with tortilla chips.",

I cooked on Low, expecting to be out all day but came back home mid day...yikes what a test of patience for not getting into the crock pot before cooking time was over. \nMy husband has his simply with homemade Mexican rice. Mine was in a tortilla topped with cheese and dollops of sour cream with a side of Mexican rice. This is a keeper! Glad I came across your recipe Michelle...\nP.S. A quick way to shred cooked chicken is to cut breasts in half and place them in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attached. Run on medium (6) speed for 15 to 20 seconds or until the chicken is well-shredded. No stand mixer,then use hand mixer and cut chicken into smaller pieces.",

Had to add a little salt at the end because of that, but nbd. Also left out the cayenne for Hubby's sake. He gets hiccups when he eats spicy foods! LOL! I was in a hurry and hadn't planned ahead enough to let it cook for 9 hours, so I cut up the chicken into big chunks, about 4\" each, and cooked it on High for 4 hours. The chicken was fully cooked but still in nice chunks, although it did shred easily if you went at it with a fork. I served it in soup mugs over Mexican rice and the family just loved it! Thanks for posting! (yeah, I know, the rice negated the low-carb thing, but it's optional! :D  )",
