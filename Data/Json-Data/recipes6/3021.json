I added 2 additional tablespoons of brown sugar,  2 teaspoons of molasses, and 1 tablespoon of sriracha.  Perfection!  I don't care for the idea of mushy cashews so I added those just before serving.  I didn't realize that this recipe called for a multi-function pressure cooker until it was too late to turn back (oops!)  so I just threw it in a regular slow cooker.  Since the chicken was already mostly cooked from being pan fried this wasn't an issue at all.  I served over basmati rice with broccoli.",

I also didn\u2019t have time to put it in a slow cooker, and I don\u2019t have a pressure cooker. This is what I did: I mixed all the ingredients from step 3 into a sauce (except the cashews). I poured it over diced chicken in a frying pan and cooked it up. When I figured there was about 3 minutes left of cook time I put the cashews in and this kept them from being too soft. On the side I cooked brown rice in a rice maker and steamed some broccoli as well. The broccoli I served with the cashew chicken over rice. Delicious!!!",
