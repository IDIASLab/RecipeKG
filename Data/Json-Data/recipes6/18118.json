If you have a good blender, blend granulated sugar (alone in the blender) for a good 20-30 seconds and you'll get your own superfine sugar.  The rum quantity was great.  I would leave out the carbonated beverage, though, because it takes away from the strawberry flavour.",

Instead of lemon juice, substituted prepared orange juice.  Be sure to blend this long enough to give sugar time to dissolve.  Fantastic cocktail.

I recommend sweetening the drink with simple syrup or superfine sugar as the regular granulated sugar can be a little gritty. Use extra soda instead of rum for a refreshing mocktail. My kids love to drink these (without the rum of course) in a fancy glass rimmed with sugar and garnished with a lime wedge. Delicious!",
