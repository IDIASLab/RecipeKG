Instead of Cider Vinegar I used 1/2 Red Wine Vinegar & 1/2 Balsamic Vinegar.  I also didn't have Jalapenos, plus I had to feed this to my kids so I used Yellow Peppers instead, which are much more mild.  I also didn't add all of the mayo cause I ran out, but it was only like 3 tablespoons short, which turned out perfect.  Once I was done putting it together, I decided to add a little handful of cilantro since it seemed like a good match.  [Great choice by the way!]  This Mac Salad was OUTSTANDING.  I really, really liked it & I am NOT typically a Mac Salad fan.  I will definately make this again.  Infact, I can't wait to make it for my family who loves spicy stuff.  Thanks for the recipe!!",

I added chopped red bell pepper and chopped olives for color. I thought using 4 jalepeno's would be too much, but I chopped them finely and it was perfect, I love the faint spicyness. I will definetly make it again. Thanks Hawaiian Momma!",

I was a little concerned with the amount of vinegar in the sauce because it had an overpowering smell but it gelled in the end and was fine. I only used 1/2 of a jalopeno because mine were HUGE but I wish I had used the whole thing because for some reason when they are chopped up fine they are not that spicey. I think you have to make this several hours ahead so the flavors have time to mix and the sauce firms up. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing.",

To this recipe I also added a tsp. of pimentos a tad more sugar and a finely diced carrot. With my changes I'll probably make this salad again!",
