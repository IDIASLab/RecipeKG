I've pickled eggs in the past and they take a really long time to absorb flavor. I liked everything about the flavor combo and knew they would eventually be good but had no idea they would be this flavorful so quick. I wish I would have doubled the recipe! These really are that good. If using a mason jar you'll need to shake it ever so often to get the eggs good and coated. Hubs and I both agreed that this is a 5 star recipe all the way. Thanks for sharing!",
