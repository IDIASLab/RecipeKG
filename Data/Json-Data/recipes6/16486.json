It was a staple in our house and I made it with all sorts of berries peaches even apples. I lost the recipe a few years ago and have been searching for it and here it is! I knew as soon as I saw boiling water on the ingredient list that this was it! One thing I do to make it a bit easier is to just layer the fruit on top of the batter followed by the sugar and pour the water over top. Like another reviewer suggested keep a cookie sheet under the pan it usually bubbles over. This is one oof my favorite recipes ever!",
