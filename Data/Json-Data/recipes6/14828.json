Use ALL the apples called for bake about 65 minutes and cover it the last 10 minutes or so with foil if it starts to get too brown. Those who say this has no flavor must not be using enough apples which would surely change the taste and texture of this \"cake.\" Just to dress it up I drizzled it with a simple powdered sugar glaze. This is one darn good apple cake densely apple-y and incredibly good. Sent it to the office with hubby and he reported his staff were all in apple heaven!",

I made the following changes: I coarsely diced 4 granny smith apples and mixed them along with 1 1/2 tsp apple pie spice in with the batter. I also diced (more finely) 1 1/2 macintosh apples and mixed them in with the nut/sugar mixture. I substituted 1/2 c brown sugar for the white sugar and I added 1 tsp of apple pie spice with the cinnamon. Also I only had sugar-free pudding mix but it turned out fine. This is a very moist coffee cake. It filled the bundt pan pretty full but it didn't rise as much as a regular cake so it didn't overflow. I did worry that the batter was so thick but it wasn't TOO dense. I can't imagine putting ALL of the apples in with the filling layer. As it was the cake kind of falls apart at the center layer when you go to cut it. With all of the apples in the center you'd have nothing holding it together at all.",
