I did cut the sugar back to 2 cups because sweetened condensed milk is already super-sweet. I also used lemon juice from the plastic lemons you get at the grocery store because real lemons are expensive here at the moment. When you take the sherbet out of your ice cream machine don't be disappointed if it seems not to have thickened as much as regular ice cream. Once the sherbet is completely frozen in your freezer (cured) then it has a fabulous texture and the taste improves as well. Really excellent recipe!",

Since Welch's Concord Grape 100% juice is very sweet on its own I reduced the sugar by 1 cup. It was still sweet and had a gorgeous purple hue! (Someone also commented the sugar didn't dissolve so I mixed it with the grape juice before adding everything else--dissolved beautifully.) Our family is ice cream crazy and I'm the designated maker. I enjoy trying new recipes (Six 3's from this site is also excellent) and this one is definitely a keeper. We had this for our Father's Day get-together with rave reviews. Dad even suggested I quit experimenting (especially after a fresh mint/ chocolate chip disaster from another website the previous weekend!) & just stick with this one because it was the best! I'm looking forward to trying other fruit juices as another reviewer suggested. Thanks Tina for sharing a scrumptious refreshing treat!",
