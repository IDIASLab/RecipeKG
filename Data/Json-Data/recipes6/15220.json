I left off the sliced oranges but the punch still made a pretty presentation and was delicious. It was easy to prepare ahead of time by mixing all of the ingredients except the sherbert and ginger ale in a large pitcher. I made a double batch with the intention of having some later for my own family but they ended up using it all at the festival!",

Like the others I made a few changes; used sweetened strawberry koolaid 3/4 cup sugar 2 liter ginger ale 1/2 of the 1/2 gallon sherbert. I had to mix this in a big pot first it would not all fit in my punch bowl. Everyone loved it! I had 16 adults and it made plenty for everyone. The color of the punch was gorgeous too!

Based on many people commenting that it was too sweet, I cut out all the sugar and used enough sweeted kool-aid for 3 quarts even though I added the full 4 quarts of water.  I also floated sliced strawberries in the punch bowl and only added 5-6 large scoops of sherbet rather than the whole box.  Everyone LOVED it!  Most guests went back for seconds and one guy had 4 glasses of it.  I plan to use it for home entertaining sometime soon and I will also add rum!",
