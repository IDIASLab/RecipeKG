I noticed that the ingredient list called fo for water and yet it was not specified as to how it was to be used in the instructions. I put two and two together and figured it was to moisten the cocoa but this should be clarified. Also in terms of marbling I think it would be better to divide the dough into two portions and add the cocoa to one portion so that you have a dark dough that can then be folded into the light one. I think this would allow for a more even marbling with less stirring.",
