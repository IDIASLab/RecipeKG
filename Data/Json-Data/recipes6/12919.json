If your cookies are not crisp then your oil isn't hot enough. If there not good the 2nd day then you haven't used air tight storage. To keep the cookies at there best you should wait until serving to put the honey on them. Oh and no this isn't a quick cookies to make. Plan on taking your time and know that you will be at this for a while. My only other suggestion is that you can cut the dough into dimonds and slice a slit in the middle and fold one side through the hole then fry.",

A teaspoon of vanilla or orange extract will liven it up. Besdies the already noted input that the oil needs to be HOT as hot as you can go without burning the oil the cookies themselves should be thin. The thinnner you can get them the better they will fry and the crisper and less oily they will appear. While shopping at a local Italian market in San Diego I came across a cute little cookie company Cookies con Amore that actually makes these in a variety of flavors. They did not have the honey but they were REALLY close to what my Nonna used to make!",

These keep well for weeks in kept in air tight containers which may be hard to find as these are large and fragile cookies. We did add flavorings like vanilla or anise or rum to enrich the flavor. We also used the pasta machine instead of rolling out with 6 selections on the machine we rolled to number 5 then cut them into strips and made a slit in the center pulling one end through the slot making a bowtie effect. Mom would roll and I would cut. We dusted with XXX sugar when cooled but did not use honey. Mom is gone but these cookies remind of her often and make them just in her honor. smokeygal",
