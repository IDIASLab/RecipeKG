Push in bottom and up sides of pie pan and bake at 350 for 5 or so minutes with pie weights, or other way to keep the crust flat.",

Make sure when cooking over double boiler that you let all of the water cook out. My mom uses a paper towel to absorb some of the water. It helps to keep the crust from becoming soggy. THIS is the ONLY recipe for pumpkin pie that we have ever used. A small difference in my recipe is the cooking directions. They are... Beat egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar (add gradually) until thick. Add pumpkin milk salt and spices. Cook in double boiler until real thick. COOL. Add gelatine stiffened in cold water (stir until gelatine dissolves. Add egg whites with remaining 1/2 cup sugar (merangue) Fold into pumpkin mixture. Pour mixture into cooled baked shell and chill. If desired top with sweetened whipped cream. Very good. Give it a try. Might take a few times (practice) to get it right but don't give up because this is the Best when done right.",
