The taste of the hazelnuts really comes through. Perfect for a ladies lunch or nice brunch. To make it more convenient by using my mixer I beat the eggs vanilla & sour cream in my mixer's work bowl tossed the flour baking soda & powder on a sheet of wax paper and added to eggs in mixer mixed briefly then added melted chocolate mixture mixed briefly last folded in hazelnuts by hand - turned out great. Made three mini-loaf pans (2\"x5\"x2.5\") baked for 30-35 minutes. A keeper!",
