The wheat flour cornbread dumplings didn't go over well with hubby.  \nI didn't add jalapenos and had to improvise a substitute for molasses as  my molasses had expired years ago.  embarrassing.\nAlthough the flavor was good, the prep time was too much for me.

I think I'd rather make it separately in the future rather then this route. While this is a healthy version that I wouldn't say was bad, I would say there are better options. Also, it says Spicy, but I used a while can of hot chopped jalapenos and there was NO SPICE at all. I would recommend if you want spice adding more jalapenos or maybe even a dash of cayenne pepper.",
